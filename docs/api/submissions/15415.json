The toddler's mother was a friend of my aunt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was outside sitting by the pool on a pool chair. At this moment pretty much everyone was inside because a game was on. I was just outside alone by the pool. I don't know how to swim but I had on trunks and enjoy putting my legs in the water. I was on my phone too so I wasn't really paying attention. From like the corner of my eye I see a toddler sprinting away but I didn't think much of it. Everyone seems to think I should see a hint of a child and immediately go into parental mode and stop the child. But my mind didn't even connect. I just continued on my phone then I heard a splash. That's when I looked and saw the kid in the deep end of the pool. I shouted that the kid fell in the pool and someone ran out, jumped in, and pulled the kid out. The kid is fine but the mother and some other people were angry at me and said I should have stopped the kid from getting in. I just said they ran in. The mother also said I should have pulled the kid out but I told her that I can't swim. She seems to think I'm some colossal asshole. It was going on and no matter what I said she would just keep cutting me off and repeat herself and was really whiny. So I just told her that I'm done talking to her. I didn't know her before the day so if this random lady thinks I'm a dick, oh well. I just got back in the chair and ignored her the rest of the day. A few other people are agreeing with her and saying \"you see a child, you just become a alert, it's natural.\" If I were walking down the road on a dark night and see a child alone.

Most people tend to assume that because there's more people around, less risk of drowning. But what actually happens is everyone assumes someone else is watching the kids when in fact *no one* is watching them.\n\nJust because you were in the pool area doesn't mean you could've been fast enough to stop the kid from getting in the water. Being an adult also doesn't change the fact that you can't swim, so you jumping in after the kid in the deep end would've just resulted in two people needing rescuing. You immediately got the attention of someone who *could* help, that is **exactly** what you should've done.\n\nAnd the parents should be watching their kid better.

And when you did see what happened you immediately got help.\n\nThe real AH is the person that let a toddler run around a pool with no floatation aids and no one explicitly watching them. They may as well have let the kid run around outside alone in the hope someone else would keep them out of traffic.", "NTA. You shouted and don't swim. Parents should be watching their own kid. In this day and age, you could get hurt touching someone else's kid.", "NTA. \n\nYou sounded the alarm, the most you can do if you can't swim. What did they expect you to do, jump in only to drown while attempting rescue? \n\nThe mother seems to be projecting her own guilt of not watching her child onto you.", "NTA.

You did the right thing by screaming for help \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you ignored the kid when he fell in. You shouted for help, and help came. Since you can't swim, jumping in yourself would have just required *you* to be rescued along with the kid.\n\nIt really isn't your fault the kid ran into the pool.\n\nThe fact that the parents had to be *told* the kid fell into the pool shows that they were not paying close enough attention to him. That is, probably *nobody* could have *prevented* his running into the pool, but the parents should have had a close enough eye on him that they observed it themselves.", "NTA. \nWhy wasn't the parent (or any other parent) aware of the location of a roaming toddler while at a house with a pool?

I can't tell you how many times I had to tell parents at the pools I worked at that they *did not* want their child to have my undivided attention because that would mean their child needed rescue.", "NTA.  You raised the alarm which did save the kid.  The parents just know they screwed up and want to deflect the blame to you.", "NTA and I say this as a mother of small children.

This cute notion that all people should go into parenting mode is just fantasy.

So you would have had the chance to decline (because valid boundaries!) and then she could have found another solution. Yes, it could have been a tragic accident. Yes, you could have been a hero. But of you don't have that automatic \"protect the child\" reaction? Maybe you're also too young to have it?", "NTA copium from the parents who were actually supposed to be watching the kid.

Kids do stupid stuff all the time, nobody can avoid everything that could endangere the child. Imo you did the best you could. You saw a child in danger and called for help. It would be highly unwise to go into the pool yourself if you can't swim. I think it's an emotional immature behaviour of the mother to tell you, you should have behaved otherwise. If the mother (or the parents) stop watching their child near a dangerous environment (like the an open pool), the least they could do is ask someone to watch over the kid.

But basic toddler safety near a pool is that the parent does not take their eyes off the child OR they explicitly get someone else to watch the child.

As a mother i can understand the instant fear and a \"you where right there why couldn't you get him\" kind of thought BUT it doesn't take more then a couple seconds of thought (after you said you can't swim) to relize that wouldn't have helped. \n\n\nSwimming and holding a toddler is literally the hardest thing I've ever done and I'm a pretty good swimmer. Imagine trying to hold one well not even knowing how to swim. If you wouldn't have alerted people and went in after the toddler to the deep end there's a good chance you both would have ended up hurt. \n\n\nYou're not just NTA you did the absolute right thing.", "NTA, you jumping in to save the kid would have created a larger problem since you came swim. You sounded the alarm and the child was saved. Two things come to mind, one is why isn\u2019t the pool gated? Two, maybe this is enough of a reason to learn to swim? The ability to swim is definitely a good tool to have.", "NTA.  Not your child, not your responsibility to be mindful of their actions.  The parent was mad at themselves but took it out on you.", "NTA\n\n\nAs someone who as a toddler did this same thing at a pool party it's definitely not your fault. Luckily my mum saw I'd gone in and dived in immediately to pluck out my overconfident four year old ass.\n\n\n\nIts up to the parent to keep watch of their kid if they're too young to be unsupervised near a pool. To expect someone who's both not minding that child and can't swim themselves to go all Baywatch is madness. They're just trying to cover up their own bad parenting.", "NTA \n\n\"I saw a kid running\" Ok. Was it running AT the pool? You left out that important detail.\n\nPool parties have a long long history of lazy groups of parents assuming their kid is watched by another, so no one pays attention and kids die. If a parent specifically told you to watch for kids in the pool, that would be one situation. But absent of that ask, it's on the parent 100%. You did good immediately shouting for help. I highly recommend learning to swim as it's extremely practical.", "Some people might say you're a hero. Not me though I loved Krusty.", "Nta.  You shouted, you can't swim and honestly, some people don't have the parentall instinct.  The mother was yelling out of guilt.", "NTA and if you had jumped in then they would have had to SAVE two people..", "NTA. Jumping in the water when you can't swim would have been foolish. You did the only thing that you could do, which was alert this negligent mother that her child was in the pool.", "NTA - given the circumstances you reacted perfectly.", "NTA\n\n1. You don't swim.\n2. Grabbing someone else's kid without specific permission is often a good way to be accused of bad intent these days.\n3. Why weren't the parents looking out for their kid?", "So they wanted an adult who doesn\u2019t know how to swim to miraculously learn in under 20 seconds to save their kid? I have a lot of little cousins and we always make sure they have arm floaties on if they\u2019re even in the vicinity of a pool. You screamed for help which was the only thing you could do in the situation and more than was already being done considering nobody was watching the kid. \nNTA", "NTA you know what's worse than one person drowning? Two people drowning! Which is what would have happened if you jumped in.", "NTA. \n\nIt wasn't your job to watch that toddler, it was it's parents. As they didn't ask to keep an eye on it, there is no reason for you not to be on your phone or whatever. Where were they btw? It's a pool party, they should know better than not to keep an eye on their child.\n\n\nAs for your reaction when it happened: everyone has a fight/flight or freeze respons when something happens. This is not something you can control or change easily. It seems yours is freeze, it's a natural reflex and happens to the best of us.", "NTA\n\nBecause you're not familliar with toddlers. I am and I saw it coming. But no one can't expect someone inexperienced to think that toddlers are self-destructive little machines who tries their best to kill themselves. Well not really, they're not suicidal, they just don't know what is dangerous and what isn't.\n\nI do remember when I was younger and being surprised and shocked at what toddlers gets into.\n\nAlso because you can't swim and it would have been foolish to jump in.\n\nAnd finally because when there's kids and pools you organize some system so there's always at least one adult that supervize the pool at all times. Usually the kids' parents take turns.", "This is the correct comment- it seems to me that the only actually responsible person at the party was the OP and thank goodness they happened to be at the poolside when the kid jumped in! NTA", "On my second birthday, I was outside with my dad, aunt, uncle, grandmother, and grandfather by the pool. Everyone managed to be doing something else right when I decided to fall in the pool. My dad turned around and saw me floating and did his best Olympic diving impression, coming up underneath me and grabbing me by one leg. Everyone knew I was out there, it\u2019s not like I came out of the house and fell in, but they all looked away for a second and that was all it took. \n\nOP diving in would NOT have been helpful. They can\u2019t swim so there was a real risk of BOTH of them drowning.", "My exSIL and BIL have a really nice house and pool and they host a lot of the family gatherings and have the pool open.  Ang the pool is not attached to the house and has a good fence, so a toddler has to be let into the area.  \n\nAfter one party where the only parent to follow the kids must be supervised by a parent didn't get anything to eat because her now ex couldn't be bothered to stop being a fluffing social butterfly long enough to bring her a cold hot dog, she started hiring a lifeguard.  \n\nBut, OP, you are NTA.  They were just deflecting the blame onto you because they couldn't be bothered to watch their own kid.", "Seriously. I was at a pool party, in the pool with my nephews. The middle one who was about four years old at the time, was floating on a raft. I was about two feet away, treading water while talking to my sister who was out of the pool, watching her other kids. Out of nowhere, the middle one rolled off the raft and into the water. My best guess is he was trying to roll over and just kept going. I immediately dove underwater, grabbed him, surfaced and handed him to my sister. He was frightened but otherwise fine. \n\nThe adults and I were discussing it later and we were all slightly shaken by how quickly it happened and how he was able to fall in the water with his aunt and his mother only a few feet away. Neither one of us could have possibly prevented it. NTA.", "So true. There are a lot of cases of people drowning trying to help others in trouble.", "Yep. At our parties we actually have a lanyard that someone can take to be the water watcher, if they need to grab food or take a break it gets handed to someone else and they are then the water watcher. It has a plastic duck on it so you can see it on your neck and always remember you're currently the water watcher.\nThat's in addition to parents keeping an eye on their own kids as well. In this way, everyone consciously shares responsibility and we all still get to have fun too.", "You\u2019re exactly right. I\u2019m used to work for CPS and we had a training where it was discussed that in large group gatherings everyone assumes that someone is watching the kids instead of designating some kind of child watch. Whoever is the closest adult is usually blamed for any incident.", "Many flotation aids are worse than nothing since they can easily slip off and give a false sense of security.", "The amount of parents I see everywhere that don't keep an eye on their kids is astounding. Nta", "Right? It sounds like OP saved the kid because no one else knew the kid was even near the pool. \n\nIn case no one else says it: Good for you, OP!! Well done!", "Or the father.", "Making sure that kids don't drown isn't parenting. It's basic human decency.", "He was a hero - he called for help.", "Don\u2019t parents use water wings anymore? When mine was little, I always put them on her and still never let her out of my sight.", "I don't know why everyone in this thread is so hung up on the fact that OP can't swim? It's a pool. It's not the ocean.", "If the kid were in the end I could walk through I would have just gotten the kid myself", "OP made it clear that kid was in the deep end.", "It's not OP's job to parent someone else's child. The asshole here is the parents for not looking after their own child.", "Shit take. They were on their phone and not watching for random unattended toddlers.", "That is something we're a bit aware in my familly. It's like \"who's watching the kids?\" \"There's Phil by the pool\" \"Does he know he is watching the kids?\" \" \"YO PHIL you watch the kids, right?\" \"Yeah\".", "Yes, absolutely. I only mentioned the mother as she was the parent mentioned in the post.", "No but if you see a random kid by a pool it\u2019s common decency to say or do something about it.\n\nNo shit it\u2019s the parents job. If you see someone about to walk into the middle of a crowded intersection I\u2019d hope you\u2019d say something.", "If I just see some kid running around out of the corner of my eye, I wouldn't care. Because I would assume the parents would be there with them. This is bad parenting, plain and simple. OP did absolutely nothing wrong.", "That requires being aware that there is no adult watching the kid."]}
