Grew up with obese parents, went through a big depressive episode after a break up then started counting calories and exercising.\n\nI lost a lot of weight, and look fine now. \n\nThat is to say, I know both what it feels like being overweight and how shitty you feel when you start your diet.\n\nSo we went out for dinner with my boyfriend's family- his parents, and his sister. His sister is slightly overweight. \n\nBoth the parents, the daughter and my BF order way less food than they usually do- I notice it, but since I don't know why and since I'm pretty hungry (Skipped lunch because of work) I order a whole-ass hamburger with fries. \n\nAs I'm ordering, my BF says that maybe I should show support to his sister and skip the fires, or maybe  pick a smaller hamburger. \n\nApparently, the sister's on a diet, and since the family wants to help her they've all put themselves on a diet when she's around.\n\nI said I felt for her, but I was hungry- and their salads dishes were almost more expensive than my hamburger and fries. Since I was paying for myself and was really starving (like, hunger pangs level) I said there was no way I was having less than an hamburger and fries. \n\nHis sister got angry then, said I have a good metabolism and have no idea the effort it takes to lose weight, and seeing me eat my fries would be very hard for her. I was doing the equivalent of shoving a whiskey glass under an alcoholic's nose.\n\nSince I didn't want to make a scene,  I asked if my boyfriend felt the same and when he said yes, I just asked the waitress to make my hamburger and fries to go, then left the place altogether.\n\nIn hindsight, though, I'm starting to regret my actions. I know how she feels, and it wouldn't have cost me anything to eat less with them, and stop by some other place on the way back. \n\nIdk. Was I an asshole?

If you Google it with all the toppings they put on salads a lot of the time they can have more calories than a burger. \n\nLosing weight is about what you do. I walk everywhere. Over 20,000 steps a day. I eat 5 times a day. I eat burgers and fries. Onion rings drink milkshakes sometimes for a treat. It's about what you do. I don't eat hamburger buns. I get two large lettuce leaves at fast food places. Sit down places a knife and fork. \n\nI have lost about 70 lbs doing this. Gone from a 24 to a 14. My family eats whatever they want and I don't throw fits about it.", "NTA. I have questions.  Why didn't anyone tell you ahead of time? Why eat out at all?

Even on a diet she has to deal with the fact that there will allways be people around her who can eat endlessly and not gain weight.", "NTA.

I'll be honest,.if I am paying to go out for dinner, I'm eating what I want. \nGood for her for being on a diet, but that is NOT your problem. \nAnd if it is a real problem for her to manage.....maybe she should consider delaying going out to dinner until it is less of a challenge.", "Wow that is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard.  \"I was doing the equivalent of shoving a whiskey glass under an alcoholic's nose.\" \n\nWhat? not at all. \n\nFirstly, nobody forced you to be an alcoholic, so I fail to see why it's my job to make sure you don't succumb to your desires.

Unless they told you in advance, how were you supposed to know? BF and his family were bloody rude (excuse my Australian). NTA and not a doormat either. Good for you!", "NTA. Her weightloss journey is hers, not yours. If she is so easily triggered by others eating a meal, then it's on her to avoid such situations, but it is not on you to amend your eating to please her anxieties. If your BF had given you a heads-up, then I guess you can argue it'd be an act of kindness to adapt slightly and eat something beforehand, though even then it's entirely voluntary - but he didn't tell you anything. Zero fault on your end and good on you for walking out.", "They are wrong here but I think leaving the restaurant was too much.", "IDK what your bf's family thinks but a diet ain't a one-meal effort. If they wanna show support and join the sister in her diet journey, that would make more sense.

You were particularly hungry, so eating the appropriate amount of food was right for you.", "ESH.  Your bf should have given you a heads up on what the issue was.  Your gf's sister needs to learn how to diet on her own without being the center of attention.  You had the right to order what you want, and once you saw that the family was in support mode, that was your time to show if you would be supportive or not.  \n\nYou could have used that as an opportunity to explain your weight loss journey and be of some help.  Everyone failed to communicate here.", "Honestly I think getting your food to go and leaving was over dramatic", "But your soon to be ex should have given you a heads up, or at least told you when you were looking at the menu, and not when you ordered.\n\nA light conversation about the diet & what folks are ordering and SETTING EXPECTIONS for the meal at the start would have been the thing to do.\n\nYours possibly was not the best way to handle it, but neither was the sister's.\n\nNTA, but bordering on ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she is on a diet and having an issue with what you are eating, that is a bigger issue that needs to be addressed. Perhaps if she has a problem, she is not ready to be in restaurants as of yet. I know the diet struggle from being both overweight and very underweight.", "ALL THIS. Right here.", "Yeah, she\u2019s setting herself up to fail\u2014which is beside the point. OP, NTA.", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. It\u2019s hard to lose weight and you know this personally. But she can\u2019t expect everyone around her to go on a freaking diet. The whole point of eating out is for everyone to enjoy their meal.", ">I would have showed her an old picture of myself, the told her I do know what it's like.\n\nWhile that does sound tempting, it would most likely accomplish nothing and possibly make it look like OP was throwing her weight loss in the sister's face. She said she didn't want to cause a scene so she did the right thing in just leaving to avoid seeming like an insensitive asshole. If BF's sister was willing, OP could've discussed her own weight loss with the sister later privately and possibly given her some tips. Even then there's a good chance the sister would take it as OP throwing it in her face or just be completely unresponsive. \n\nI say this as someone who used to be obese and then struggled for years with an eating disorder. Weight and weight loss are such touchy subjects so you really need to tiptoe around them, especially in this case when it seems OP isn't close with BF's sister.", "It works if you work it, so work it; you're worth it!", "You had to eat out 5 times in one week???\n\nThat sounds expensive, especially if the program was paid. Lol", "It included fast food (did you know they all have salads?  And that quite often the burger is your best choice?). And lots of people get takeout or similar at lunch 5 days a week.\n\nThe overall program I was on was provided by my health insurance as preventative care along with personal coaching sessions and some equipment (digital scale and fitbit). But that program had some issues (100% calorie counting, identifying foods as \"bad\" and \"good\") so I modified it to my own program using various sources, including one (I won't plug it by name) that included the eating out part.\n\nThat one was definitely focused on white middle class married suburbanites with double income, 2 kids and a golden retriever, so the exact opposite of me. But also included lots of good practical tips (e.g. there was another whole segment on dealing with unconscious sabotage by loved ones and how to deal with family holidays) as well as the eating out one.", "NTA. It was a rude request, first of all. \n\nIt was especially rude of them to wait until you ordered to make that request, and single you out. Your bf could have warned you and given you the option to decide ahead of time if you could reasonably accommodate her or maybe not go.", "Nta she has to learn to improve on her own not rely on others to change for her", "NTA.   A hamburger and fries isn\u2019t exactly an insane amount to order, it seems fairly standard to me.    \n\nI\u2019ve also struggled with my weight but I\u2019d never expect anyone else not to order what they want when dining out together.    The most I\u2019ve ever asked of anyone when I was losing weight is requesting my mum make sure healthy options were available if I went to dinner wt her house.", "NTA post a throw back of your accomplishment/weight lost on your social media :)", "First why his she going out when she is on a diet like if she is to go to a restaurent then she should do it for real cause she can eat vegetable at home no need to go out and second if you are offended because someone eat a burger there is a big problem. Nta", "NTA - you can\u2019t (or at least shouldn\u2019t) push your diet on others.  \nJust because her family cater to her inability to stick to a diet alone you don\u2019t have to.", "I particularly liked the line from the sister about drinking in front of an alcoholic.\n\nTo make the analogy more accurate, the sister is getting mad at OP for drinking in front of an alcoholic *AT A BAR.*\n\nIt's so ridiculous lol", "tbh that family enforcing this kind of shit is low key toxic, she would expect people to accommodate her every time, which is impossible irl.", "\"can you not snack around her, please be considerate\"  \npfft", "I totally agree with what your saying. I'm a petty person because of my toxic childhood. \n\nBut I agree, she definitely did the right thing in just leaving an not giving in to them. \n\nNone of them are helping the sister by eating salads around her and are really just enabling and hurting her in the long run. \n\nI hate my weight and workout all the time and eat healthy all the time and still can't seem to shake it. It sucks, buti couldn't imagine acting like the bus sister when it comes to the food of others around me."]}
