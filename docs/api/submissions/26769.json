Grew up with obese parents, went through a big depressive episode after a break up then started counting calories and exercising.\n\nI lost a lot of weight, and look fine now. \n\nThat is to say, I know both what it feels like being overweight and how shitty you feel when you start your diet.\n\nSo we went out for dinner with my boyfriend's family- his parents, and his sister. His sister is slightly overweight. \n\nBoth the parents, the daughter and my BF order way less food than they usually do- I notice it, but since I don't know why and since I'm pretty hungry (Skipped lunch because of work) I order a whole-ass hamburger with fries. \n\nAs I'm ordering, my BF says that maybe I should show support to his sister and skip the fires, or maybe  pick a smaller hamburger. \n\nApparently, the sister's on a diet, and since the family wants to help her they've all put themselves on a diet when she's around.\n\nI said I felt for her, but I was hungry- and their salads dishes were almost more expensive than my hamburger and fries. Since I was paying for myself and was really starving (like, hunger pangs level) I said there was no way I was having less than an hamburger and fries. \n\nHis sister got angry then, said I have a good metabolism and have no idea the effort it takes to lose weight, and seeing me eat my fries would be very hard for her. I was doing the equivalent of shoving a whiskey glass under an alcoholic's nose.\n\nSince I didn't want to make a scene,  I asked if my boyfriend felt the same and when he said yes, I just asked the waitress to make my hamburger and fries to go, then left the place altogether.\n\nIn hindsight, though, I'm starting to regret my actions. I know how she feels, and it wouldn't have cost me anything to eat less with them, and stop by some other place on the way back. \n\nIdk. Was I an asshole? I'm almost afraid to ask, ahaha.", "created_utc": 1694596225, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hi3vd/aita_for_eating_a_lot/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's the root of the problem, right here.\n\nKnowing you wouldn't be able to eat properly you could've just skipped the outing and order takeout at home. \n\nAlso, they made a decision, you did not. You were hungry and it wasn't their treat - you were paying for yourself. They have no right to police your food for your money, lol.\n\nPlus, his sister shouldn't go out with people if she can't see them eat. Should all the people in the restaurant skip their meal as well? She can't expect whole world to revolve around her diet.", "NTA. you were asked out for dinner, not to partake in some kind of weird support group eating experience. Your BF's sister expecting everyone around her to modify their behaviour to manage her problem is not OK.  Your BFs family dropping this on you *after* you sat down and started to order is also not OK.\n\nShe's the one on the diet. You don't go on a diet and expect everyone around you to also go on your diet. Imagine she decided to follow one of those stupid fad diets and was only eating cranberries on kale or whatever, and insisted everyone else did because she couldn't stand the sight of a carrot.", "NTA.\n\nThe world does not revolve around her weight loss. Further, it is absolutely wrong for her to police or shame or control what anyone else is eating, and thoroughly hypocritical. \n\nI admire your sensitivity towards her because I would have eaten my hamburger and fries in front of her and enjoyed every bite. \n\nAnd no, it is not the same as \u201cshoving a whisky glass under someone\u2019s nose\u201d. You weren\u2019t shoving anything under her nose and alcohol and food are not the same thing.", "As someone who has also struggled with their weight and eating habits in the past, I can tell you that you are NTA. \n\n1) If your bf felt this strongly about it he should have made you aware of this when he invited you to dinner with the family, not AFTER you had already ordered. \n\n2) if the sister is struggling so much with her diet that seeing other people eat something more substantial with a salad will set her off, her weight loss attempts aren't going to be very successful or long-lasting without some deeper introspective work. \n\n3) it is not your job to go hungry just so someone else can feel better about their food choices.", "If you're trying to lose weight and are triggered by other people eating nice foods, don't eat out.\n\nMaking an entire table feel like they can't enjoy / order the food they want is ridiculously selfish.\n\nAny diet where you don't ever treat yourself to nice food on a special occasion is also doomed to fail.\n\nNTA", "NTA. As someone who used to hardcore diet and is still struggling to maintain a healthy weight, other people's diets shouldn't mean a constraint on your own meals. You weren't bragging about being able to eat a lot, you were just...eating.", "NTA. And the alcohol analogy is bullshit. One needs food to sustain themself. Alcohol is not a necessity.", "NTA.  If the sister is going to go out in public, she will always see people eating more than her.  She needs to get used to this.  It is not as if you ordered 3 deserts with your meal.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA, I am on CICO myself and it\u2019s my life and my choice. no one else has to eat what i do or as little as i do just because I am taking care of myself.", "NTA. The world does not revolve around her. If they really wanted to help support her weight loss, they would have gone somewhere with salads or healthy food, not burgers and fries. Also, they should have warned you ahead of time that everyone would be eating less to 'support' her. \n\nI probably would have just ordered less food and then gotten something to go for when I left, but you still handled it well.", "NTA\n\ni find you were very elegant in just going away without starting a discussion. Their logic is preposterous, if the sister can't handle seeing someone eating fries she should just not go to restaurant. yep, it's that easy. And let's be fair here, a burger and fries is not A LOT.", "NTA and a burger and fries is not an abnormal meal size. Depending on dressings etc a salad is not always even healthier. You are allowed to eat what you want.

NTA", "NTA. If we all restricted ourselves based on what others can/cannot do/eat/drink/partake in, no-one would be doing anything. Even if her family all goes along with it, she's going to come across eating situations in life where others are eating more than her (weddings, work events, etc.) Sure, it's hard, but she will have to learn to deal with those situations.", "NTA this is ridiculous if she can\u2019t stand to even see another person eat French fries because it\u2019s like whiskey for an alcoholic she probably shouldn\u2019t be going out to places to eat that serve them the same way an alcoholic shouldn\u2019t go hang out at a bar", "NTA. That's bullshit and setting up the daughter/sister for a fall if she (or her parents?) expects the world to diet around her. I really hope you still enjoyed the burger.", "Never be shy of the bulk brodette. \n\nBut real talk, someone else's diet is not your concern as long as you're not being a dick about it (which you were not), on the other hand.. Your BF and his sister have issues. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThe sister needs a dose of reality. Being an alcoholic and being a greedy slob are not the same thing.\n\nLosing weight requires willpower, that's it. Nobody else should have to suffer just because they can't control themselves. \n\nHope the burger was good!", "NTA, first off they didn't tell you what they were doing. Second...WTF!! If you Google it with all the toppings they put on salads a lot of the time they can have more calories than a burger. \n\nLosing weight is about what you do. I walk everywhere. Over 20,000 steps a day. I eat 5 times a day. I eat burgers and fries. Onion rings drink milkshakes sometimes for a treat. It's about what you do. I don't eat hamburger buns. I get two large lettuce leaves at fast food places. Sit down places a knife and fork. \n\nI have lost about 70 lbs doing this. Gone from a 24 to a 14. My family eats whatever they want and I don't throw fits about it.", "NTA. I have questions.  Why didn't anyone tell you ahead of time? Why eat out at all? I KNOW and agree people on diets are allowed to eat out of course, but they have to be able to accept everyone else ordering what they like. Coulda just got a salad and fruit tray at Costco imo", "Pretend to go on some restrictive diet and get \"upset\" if they don't follow it with you, if you want to be petty", "I m more dramatic and petty. I would just order Tapwater and eat later, even if i would suffer hungry.\n\nNTA Why eat at a burger place? Was the sister angry at other people at other tables too? Even on a diet she has to deal with the fact that there will allways be people around her who can eat endlessly and not gain weight.", "NTA. His sister assumed you were skinnier and could eat a burger a fries due to metabolism, not due to the hard work that you put in.", "NTA\n\nIf your boyfriend had told you what was happening in advance, you could have planned appropriately - not skipped lunch or snacked before you came to dinner.\n\nCould you have eaten less then gone home and eaten more or maybe got extra takeaway on your way home? Yes. But people aren't rational when they are hangry.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"As I'm ordering, my BF says that maybe I should show support to his sister and skip the fires, or maybe pick a smaller hamburger.\" .. this is bullshit.", "Nta", "NTA. I went from obese to very fit also, so I know the same feelings, however at no point in my weight loss journey did I or would I ever expect everyone else around me to eat less. I don\u2019t know what anyone else\u2019s dietary needs or desires have anything to do with my own. I wouldn\u2019t have thought you were an AH even if you\u2019d eaten right beforehand, ordered your burger and fries (a super normal meal), and then didn\u2019t finish half of it and got a to go box.", "NTA. I'll be honest,.if I am paying to go out for dinner, I'm eating what I want. \nGood for her for being on a diet, but that is NOT your problem. \nAnd if it is a real problem for her to manage.....maybe she should consider delaying going out to dinner until it is less of a challenge.", "Wow that is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard.  \"I was doing the equivalent of shoving a whiskey glass under an alcoholic's nose.\" \n\nWhat? not at all. \n\nFirstly, nobody forced you to be an alcoholic, so I fail to see why it's my job to make sure you don't succumb to your desires. That is on you mate. \n\nSecondly, they are at a restaurant so what did they expect?  These people seem a bit entitled if you ask me. \n\nThis whole thing seems silly, and the sister should get over herself. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Run. These are people who will make your life miserable.  If the sister cannot be around a burger than she should not be coming to a restaurant. This is actually completely insane that they want to police what you eat to please her. And, I am so impressed with your actions. You took care of yourself instead of agreeing to be forced to do something that makes no sense.", "You left out the bit involving telepathy? Unless they told you in advance, how were you supposed to know? BF and his family were bloody rude (excuse my Australian). NTA and not a doormat either. Good for you!", "NTA. Her weightloss journey is hers, not yours. If she is so easily triggered by others eating a meal, then it's on her to avoid such situations, but it is not on you to amend your eating to please her anxieties. If your BF had given you a heads-up, then I guess you can argue it'd be an act of kindness to adapt slightly and eat something beforehand, though even then it's entirely voluntary - but he didn't tell you anything. Zero fault on your end and good on you for walking out.", "They are wrong here but I think leaving the restaurant was too much.", "IDK what your bf's family thinks but a diet ain't a one-meal effort. If they wanna show support and join the sister in her diet journey, that would make more sense. Only \"dieting\" when dining with her is so pointless.\n\nAlso her comparison of dieting to a recovery from alcoholism is hilarious.\n\nI would say N T A but your bf suggested \"skipping the fries\" which you could've easily agreed to and have them to go. Probably would've avoided the whole drama. So slight YTA", "ESH- Yeah, you should have been supportive since you know how it feels. The sister\u2019s comment about you not understanding was rude , though. I think you did the right thing by not eating the burger in front of her. You were particularly hungry, so eating the appropriate amount of food was right for you.", "ESH.  Your bf should have given you a heads up on what the issue was.  Your gf's sister needs to learn how to diet on her own without being the center of attention.  You had the right to order what you want, and once you saw that the family was in support mode, that was your time to show if you would be supportive or not.  \n\nYou could have used that as an opportunity to explain your weight loss journey and be of some help.  Everyone failed to communicate here.", "Honestly I think getting your food to go and leaving was over dramatic", "But your soon to be ex should have given you a heads up, or at least told you when you were looking at the menu, and not when you ordered.\n\nA light conversation about the diet & what folks are ordering and SETTING EXPECTIONS for the meal at the start would have been the thing to do.\n\nYours possibly was not the best way to handle it, but neither was the sister's.\n\nNTA, but bordering on ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
