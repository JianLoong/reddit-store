Everything was settle, the place, the time, everything. \n\nMaybe 3 hours before we needed to leave for the party, he got a call from a colleague, asking if he could come help him with something at work and my boyfriend accepted.

So I left a voicemail, saying I was leaving for the party and he needed to join me there.\n\nBy 9pm, everybody was here but not my boyfriend. We all waited for him but at 10, as he still didn\u2019t arrived or gave any news, his friends started leaving one by one and I decided to cancel the party altogether. I texted my boyfriend: \"Party cancelled, everybody went home and so did I.\"\n\nWhen he came home an hour later, we had a fight and he left.\n\nI didn\u2019t know where, until his mom texted me, saying that I was horrible for what I did and that he was gonna stay at hers for a while.  \n\nI do feel bad because I know he was really excited about the party.", "created_utc": 1685632816, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xkblg/aita_for_canceling_my_boyfriends_birthday_party/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was somewhere else and celebrated his bday with family. Then, when you schedule a party where you can celebrate it with him he flakes on that? Getting called for work can happen and sucks, but the general lack of communication and regard for everyone's time is concerning. Is him going in late for work is common. If not, I'd almost be tempted to look at his call log on his phone to see if it really was work. The coup de grace is running to mommy to complain and sick her on you. I hope he has other redeeming qualities because otherwise I'd personally move on.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is an ungrateful, inconsiderate and completely disrespectful AH. He never even bothered to apologize for being so late. OP, this is a major red flag, and it's time to rethink whether you want to really be with this guy.", "NTA, you had no choice.", "NTA. If you cancelled in advanced it would have been different but in fact, you were there, the guests were there and he wasn't. And he didn't provide any communication when/if he will come. He came home 2 hours after the party was supposed to start. If you were warned that it would take that long you could have jump-started the party and warn people he will join later, but leaving guests without information for over an hour - no wonder they started leaving.\n\nP.S. But also 30-year-old running to his mom after an argument with their partner? What's up with that?", "NTA you had a party, his friends came and left after 2.5 hours. You didn\u2019t cancel anything.\n\nPersonally I think running home to tell mommy means he isn\u2019t mature enough to be your partner. Run.", "NTA.  You are mistaken. If he were happy about the party he would have made an effort to attend and would have been in communication with you rather than not responding to calls.\n\nSo he was gone with no contact from 430pm to 11pm?  Sounds bogus and sketchy to me.    Where does he work and what kind of work does he do?  Sounds like he got an offer to hang out with a \"friend/colleague\" on his birthday and decided to do that instead of return for his party.\n\nAt the very least he is an a55h0le for not responding to calls when he was late for his party. The very least he could have done was be honest and tell you he wasnt coming back, knowing people were waiting for him.  The fact that he didnt call you with an update is most likely because he didnt want you to question him about what he was doing, where he was, and when he would come back.\n\nHe went to his mom's not because he was upset you cancelled the party, but because he wanted to hide from you and avoid arguments and discussion about why he didnt return for his party.  \n\nMy recommendation is to cut him loose.  I also can almost guarantee you that he didnt communicate with you because he knew you be upset & question him and he wanted to avoid that because he already knew what he was doing was wrong.", "NTA - What was everyone supposed to do? Wait 'til he sauntered in at 3 in the morning? If he wasn't required to be at work, he could have shut off his phone. He couldn't have been that excited about the party if he flaked on attending.", "NTA\n\nWhile his birthday, he knew when/what/where and inconvenienced everyone.  He should have simply said no to his colleague.", "NTA - clearly he is a wildly inconsiderate person", "NTA. Not even a text with an ETA? Not even an apology for being late? And he has the audacity to be mad at you????", "Ummm... in what way could you possibly be T A? Your boyfriend blew you (and all his friends) off, ignored his phone, and then blamed you for not keeping everyone around for hours and hours without him. You're NTA, he's a jerk, and if he isn't sincerely thanking you and apologizing to you very soon, this is a HUGE red flag. I'm guessing his mommy didn't get the truth when she texted you about how terribly you treated her prince of a baby boy.\n\nYuck.\n\nETA he had better have a damned good reason why his \"I'll be there on time\" turned into ignoring you and being three and a half hours late.", "NTA\n\nYou really didn\u2019t cancel anything, his friends started leaving at 9. They effectively cancelled it. And I do t blame them, who wants to wait hours for the bday person to show up?  \n\nWhat possible excuse could\nYour bf have for being that late?", "Assuming he was aware there was a party I\u2019d say NTA. He could establish a boundary for one night. The fact that there were people there waiting for him and they waited for several HOURS not minutes is a huge deal. If I got my ass out of my house for your party and you didn\u2019t show up because you took a work thing I\u2019d be annoyed.\n\nThere are VERY few jobs one can have that would require do something at that hour at the very last minute. And even those you can say \u201cno it\u2019s too late I have something to do\u201d", "NTA was he  expecting you  and other to sit and wait for him to be bothered to attend?\n\nLeaving him with his mum.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t cancel a party, he missed it. I honestly can\u2019t figure out how you could be TA. \n\nAs an aside, barring accident or medical emergency I can\u2019t imagine leaving a friend in the lurch like that, let alone a SO. Why are you with him?", "NTA. You had the party, the guests were there ages. He didn't have the common courtesy to think and check for messages. Ungrateful and inconsiderate", "I mean, you didn't really \"cancel\" it. He missed it. \n\nDump him.\n\nNTA", "NTA and I wouldn't call the party \"canceled\" because it wasn't canceled. The party was held and was ongoing for at least an hour before it was cut short. If the subject comes up again, be firm that your boyfriend stood you up for a party that was held in his honor.", "NTA and he totally lied to his mom about how late he was to make you out as the bad guy. Flags on this play. You sure you want to grow with this toddler?", "NTA, you did nothing wrong and he has some massive red flags there, only thing you should feel bad about is being with someone like that", "NTA. But you didn\u2019t cancel the party, you had a party and he missed it.", "NTA. How long did he really expect you to wait anyway? It was already 10PM, and that\u2019s late for a lot people. He came home at 11PM. If I was one of those guests, I would not have been the mood for any kind of party at that point. He either should have declined helping his colleague because he was already busy, or he should have just canceled the party when he agreed to help. He was the one who was being inconsiderate of other people\u2019s time.", "NTA. Leave him with his mother. So excited for the party that he couldn't give a call or anything to tell that he was running late? Don't feel bad you did your part and very well, he was the one who didn't bother to show up.", "Easy NTA. Granted, I understand something came up with work, but he should have understand that people aren't going to wait all day for him to show up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I bet his friends would be pissed that bf is mad at ALL having to wait 3 hours and not get a text or call from him.  It's the bare minimum of curtesy.  It's not like he was less than an hour late and you didn't call.  You did everything and more.  He just ran back to his mom AND had her text you!!!  The best news is he is going to stay with mommies for a few days.  Maybe those few days should be a lot longer (at least until he grows up).", "NTA. What does he do for work? If he\u2019s like\u2026 a surgeon then sure, take your time. But anything else and he\u2019s an absolute fuckhead for leaving and ignoring you.", "NTA. If he was that excited about the party he would have either been there on time or gotten in touch with you to let you know he'd be late.", "NTA. Especially not for the fact there were HOURS of waiting before people started leaving. I guess, if you'd wanted, you could have re-scheduled but I get the feeling you were pissed by then.", "He's a mechanic? In my decades of owning cars, no mechanic works that late. My dear, i believe he is cheating on you. \n\nNTA", "NTA - if you're excited for your party, try showing up!", "You didn't do anything to him.\n you communicated to him that everyone left because he didn't show up and the had better things to do, so the party is de facto canceled.\n\nHe could have picked up the phone to notify you and your friends he is late etc.\nHe didn't.\nHe is a big baby .", "NTA what did they expect? That you lock the doors so everybody is forced to stay till he dicedes to come?", "NTA and you didn't cancel it, he did.\n\nHis friends came. They stayed at least an hour...while he didn't show. And he didn't apologize or send any message.\n\nHe was an AH. Even if it was an absolute emergency, he needed to be courteous enough to tell you and the friends waiting for him.\n\nDuring the fight afterward, did he explain? Recognize that he was disrespectful? Give you any information?\n\nHe probably got a message from his mistress and stayed late. Good riddance.", "NTA\n\nWhat did he expect you to do? Guests were leaving.", "I can tell you the day my partner\u2019s mother intervenes where her nose has no business, in a situation where he was clearly in the wrong, is going to be my last day with my partner. He ran home to tell his mother instead of doing what he said he was going to do AND she didn\u2019t tell him he was an AH, herself? \n\nPsssh. Hard no. \n\nNTA", "NTA you did the right thing. you should prolly just dump him if he ignores you in the future too", "NTA. And I don't believe for one minute that he was just helping a colleague.  Something's fishy here.", "NTA. I mean what are you supposed to do, hold everyone hostage until he shows up? People were leaving lol\u2026 obviously it\u2019s canceled at that point.", "NTA. But if I were you I'd be wary of a 30-year-old running home to mommy after something like this, and her texting you. Does he often have colleagues calling him to go into work from 4:30pm to 11pm without contacting you the entire time?\n\nedit: typo", "NTA at all.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't cancel the party - his own guests were tired of waiting for him and started to leave.

Please tell me you broke up with him. If you haven\u2019t, you\u2019re accepting this type of treatment. He is widely inconsiderate and manipulative, given he\u2019s trying to put it back on you. Sounds exhausting.", "NTA. He went running to mama? Cringe.", "....and that he wouldn't admit to being in the wrong, or apologise and went running to Mummy shows he's not good boyfriend material.

All the mechanics are gone when the shop closes usually at 5 or 6p", "what a crazy concept!", "He only said that he was helping a colleague at work and that I should be more understanding.

No one is saying he can\u2019t help but when it's at the expense of other time, he\u2019s TA. Also who go running to their mom because of that.", "He must have a really important job to do a full day's work after his normal hours and not have a second to let you know he'll be late to his own party that he's really excited for! I wonder what he does.", "He works as a mechanic but wasn\u2019t supposed to work at all that day, they allowed him to take the day off", "And they don't give him a five-minute break to call and apologize for missing his own party? I'm not a car person; is it common for mechanics to work until very late in the night?", "Why did it take about six and half hours?", "yeah no. i don't believe it one bit. he didn't have to accept that call."]}
