He was somewhere else and celebrated his bday with family. Then, when you schedule a party where you can celebrate it with him he flakes on that? Getting called for work can happen and sucks, but the general lack of communication and regard for everyone's time is concerning. Is him going in late for work is common. If not, I'd almost be tempted to look at his call log on his phone to see if it really was work. The coup de grace is running to mommy to complain and sick her on you. I hope he has other redeeming qualities because otherwise I'd personally move on.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is an ungrateful, inconsiderate and completely disrespectful AH. He never even bothered to apologize for being so late. OP, this is a major red flag, and it's time to rethink whether you want to really be with this guy.", "NTA, you had no choice.", "NTA. If you cancelled in advanced it would have been different but in fact, you were there, the guests were there and he wasn't. And he didn't provide any communication when/if he will come. He came home 2 hours after the party was supposed to start. If you were warned that it would take that long you could have jump-started the party and warn people he will join later, but leaving guests without information for over an hour - no wonder they started leaving.\n\nP.S. But also 30-year-old running to his mom after an argument with their partner? What's up with that?", "NTA you had a party, his friends came and left after 2.5 hours. You didn\u2019t cancel anything.\n\nPersonally I think running home to tell mommy means he isn\u2019t mature enough to be your partner. Run.", "NTA.  You are mistaken. If he were happy about the party he would have made an effort to attend and would have been in communication with you rather than not responding to calls.\n\nSo he was gone with no contact from 430pm to 11pm?  Sounds bogus and sketchy to me.    Where does he work and what kind of work does he do?  Sounds like he got an offer to hang out with a \"friend/colleague\" on his birthday and decided to do that instead of return for his party.\n\nAt the very least he is an a55h0le for not responding to calls when he was late for his party. The very least he could have done was be honest and tell you he wasnt coming back, knowing people were waiting for him.  The fact that he didnt call you with an update is most likely because he didnt want you to question him about what he was doing, where he was, and when he would come back.\n\nHe went to his mom's not because he was upset you cancelled the party, but because he wanted to hide from you and avoid arguments and discussion about why he didnt return for his party.  \n\nMy recommendation is to cut him loose.  I also can almost guarantee you that he didnt communicate with you because he knew you be upset & question him and he wanted to avoid that because he already knew what he was doing was wrong.", "NTA - What was everyone supposed to do? Wait 'til he sauntered in at 3 in the morning? If he wasn't required to be at work, he could have shut off his phone. He couldn't have been that excited about the party if he flaked on attending.", "NTA\n\nWhile his birthday, he knew when/what/where and inconvenienced everyone.  He should have simply said no to his colleague.", "NTA - clearly he is a wildly inconsiderate person", "NTA. Not even a text with an ETA? Not even an apology for being late? And he has the audacity to be mad at you????", "Ummm... in what way could you possibly be T A? Your boyfriend blew you (and all his friends) off, ignored his phone, and then blamed you for not keeping everyone around for hours and hours without him. You're NTA, he's a jerk, and if he isn't sincerely thanking you and apologizing to you very soon, this is a HUGE red flag. I'm guessing his mommy didn't get the truth when she texted you about how terribly you treated her prince of a baby boy.\n\nYuck.\n\nETA he had better have a damned good reason why his \"I'll be there on time\" turned into ignoring you and being three and a half hours late.", "NTA\n\nYou really didn\u2019t cancel anything, his friends started leaving at 9. They effectively cancelled it. And I do t blame them, who wants to wait hours for the bday person to show up?  \n\nWhat possible excuse could\nYour bf have for being that late?", "Assuming he was aware there was a party I\u2019d say NTA. He could establish a boundary for one night. The fact that there were people there waiting for him and they waited for several HOURS not minutes is a huge deal. If I got my ass out of my house for your party and you didn\u2019t show up because you took a work thing I\u2019d be annoyed.\n\nThere are VERY few jobs one can have that would require do something at that hour at the very last minute. And even those you can say \u201cno it\u2019s too late I have something to do\u201d", "NTA was he  expecting you  and other to sit and wait for him to be bothered to attend?\n\nLeaving him with his mum.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t cancel a party, he missed it. I honestly can\u2019t figure out how you could be TA. \n\nAs an aside, barring accident or medical emergency I can\u2019t imagine leaving a friend in the lurch like that, let alone a SO. Why are you with him?", "NTA. You had the party, the guests were there ages. He didn't have the common courtesy to think and check for messages. Ungrateful and inconsiderate", "I mean, you didn't really \"cancel\" it. He missed it. \n\nDump him.\n\nNTA", "NTA and I wouldn't call the party \"canceled\" because it wasn't canceled. The party was held and was ongoing for at least an hour before it was cut short. If the subject comes up again, be firm that your boyfriend stood you up for a party that was held in his honor.", "NTA and he totally lied to his mom about how late he was to make you out as the bad guy. Flags on this play. You sure you want to grow with this toddler?", "NTA, you did nothing wrong and he has some massive red flags there, only thing you should feel bad about is being with someone like that", "NTA. But you didn\u2019t cancel the party, you had a party and he missed it.", "NTA. How long did he really expect you to wait anyway? It was already 10PM, and that\u2019s late for a lot people. He came home at 11PM. If I was one of those guests, I would not have been the mood for any kind of party at that point. He either should have declined helping his colleague because he was already busy, or he should have just canceled the party when he agreed to help. He was the one who was being inconsiderate of other people\u2019s time.", "NTA. Leave him with his mother. So excited for the party that he couldn't give a call or anything to tell that he was running late? Don't feel bad you did your part and very well, he was the one who didn't bother to show up.", "Easy NTA. Granted, I understand something came up with work, but he should have understand that people aren't going to wait all day for him to show up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He knew there's a party waiting for him and he didn't show up and got mad that you canceled it? I would think long and hard if I would stay in this relationship of I were you. Just imagine when you're married and this happens and instead of apologizing he'll make it seem like it's your fault. It was totally his fault.", "We have a mechanic shop near us. They sometimes work late, but I can't imagine any scenario outside of a car falling and trapping your BF where he couldn't respond to you.\n\nOP, I think you're being cheated on.\n\nIf you aren't, at best case scenario, you're with a guy who doesn't respect you, has anger issues, doesn't take responsibility for his actions, and runs home to mommy when he has a problem with you.\n\nWhat are you getting out of this relationship?

Since it would take extra time to go get my phone and make a text that\u2019s why I don\u2019t wind up texting my wife occasionally.", "I mean he could have told her yes, but getting called in on a day off is very normal, you get paid per piece of work not salary normally so if boss has $400 of work for you then you show up birthday or not.", "I wasn't talking about answering or not answering a call.  That's definitely an AH action.  OP has every right to be angry.\n\nI was responding to the redditor who stated, they didn't know a shop that stayed open that late.\n\nA shop doesn't need to be open for business, for them to be working late.

They also don't do it all the time, though.", "I know mechanics that work late - the shop owner lets them take in side projects that the shop would have otherwise rejected after hours.

They get worse and worse and it hurts much more the longer you ignore them. You\u2019re probably thinking \u201cwhat an idiot\u201d about me pretending this was fine and putting it out of my mind. To people on the outside, this behaviour is clear. It\u2019s hard to see when you\u2019re too close to it and don\u2019t want it to be true. \n\nWhen you\u2019re wearing rose coloured glasses, sometimes Red flags just look like flags. \n\nI hope you find someone who deserves you and is honest with you.", "NTA and his behavior sounds super bizarre.

He knew about the party and said he\u2019d be back beforehand but then that time comes and goes without him answering his phone or letting you know why he\u2019d be late or wouldn\u2019t make it.\n\n3.  He had 3 hours to help out his colleague and come back in time for a party he was allegedly excited about.\n\n4.

Changes someone oil? What emergency mechanical work needs to be done that late at night? The only thing I can think of is working on a mates project car and having a few beers while you do it, not actual work.
