All these N-T-A judgements are conveniently glossing over the fact that you essentially set Nate up to take the fall. First off, if you saw something you really wanted, why was your first instinct to ask your BF to buy it for you instead of buying it for yourself? Why foist that responsibility and expectation onto him, without any discussion or consideration about how he would feel about it? Then you proceed to just quietly judge him for a year for spending his own money the way he wants to, and on his own interests. Why did you think you were entitled to any part of that? Why should your necklace take priority over his PS5? And it's not that he hasn't gotten you gifts for those occasions you mentioned, they just weren't the gift you wanted.\n\nBut most importantly in all of this is how did your classmates know you've been wanting that necklace and that you expected Nate to buy it for you, if you didn't tell them? Clearly you've been talking about it for a year now, setting the expectation to them that you expected Nate to get it for you. So when they finally did see you wearing it, of course they assumed your BF got it for you, only for you to throw him under the bus. It's one thing if he promised to buy it for you but never did, but all of this started with your own entitlement to his money, your own expectations, and then you getting an entire class to now get behind your own selfish entitlement. But somehow Nate is the bad guy here. Nate is not upset because he is \"embarrassed\". He's upset because you set him up for a responsibility he never wanted, and then he had to suffer the consequences of said responsibility via social pressure.

Tickets for decent seats at that time were about 60-80 each. Very cheap for the play (Wicked) and the area. And he hemmed and hawed for 4 months until the crappy seats were the only ones left for over double the price.  \n\n  I tried again then, and he told me he couldn't do it cause he had just bought himself a bunch of weed, and said that he was gonna share it with me for my birthday. I didn't even smoke back then. After that I knew, he wasn't ever gonna do a damn thing to make me happy.
