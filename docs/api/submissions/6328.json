We both have jobs outside of school.\n\nI\u2019m not a big jewelry fan, but there was this necklace I really wanted ever since I saw it on Pandora.  It was love at first sight.  I asked Nate if he could give it to me for my birthday.  He didn\u2019t want to spend a lot, so I found some alternatives on Etsy he could look into that were more affordable.  Think a $25 pendant vs $75 on the Pandora site.  \n\nSince then, my birthday, our anniversary and Valentines Day happened and I never got the necklace.  He gave me candy and a hat, which is disappointing when he treats himself to a PS5 and some new games.  \n\nSo when I saw my necklace for sale online, I decided \u201cscrew it, I\u2019ll get it myself\u201d.  I\u2019ve been wearing it ever since I got it in the mail.\n\nRecently, my classmates asked me if Nate bought me the necklace for Christmas.  I proudly told them no, I got it myself.  They all know how much I wanted it and a few of them are now making fun of Nate for not doing the thing for me.  \n\nNate is upset that I embarrassed him in front of our class and friends.  He got even more upset when I told him that he had a year to get me the necklace.  He wants me to apologize, but I won\u2019t.

I tell him. He buys it for me. (Within reason\u2026 I\u2019m not out here requesting crazy expensive gifts \ud83e\udd72)\n\nYou told him, gave him alternatives, made it clear how much you wanted it. He didn\u2019t get it for you. He got you other stuff. You got it for yourself. He got mad when people found out. End of story. \n\nWhy should you apologise for getting yourself something you wanted??", "NTA...he showed you how unimportant you are to him & he's just embarrassed that others found out. My question is why are with this guy when he's clearly shown you how little you mean to him. These little gestures or lack thereof are very indicative of how the relationship will go in the future. He'll spend a lot of money on expensive games but will not save to get you something you really want. \n\nMy ex would only have to mention that she liked something. She wouldn't even have to ask. Like she saw something she liked, expressed it and I asked to see, and for her birthday I surprised her with it. You specifically asked and gave him multiple chances so he clearly has no interest in your wants and needs.", "NTA you bought yourself a gift. One your boyfriend couldn\u2019t be bothered with and he\u2019s upset with you? Time to see the light.", "Nta. These are called natural social consequences.", "NTA - Sometimes we need to reach goals and do things ourselves. You stopped pining for him to make a decision. ENJOY!  You did what you wanted to do; no 'had' to. Embrace your independent self.", "NTA.  Nate embarrassed himself.  He should be apologizing to you.  If he could afford a PS5 and new games, he could have done without 1 game and gotten the necklace.", "NTA. You bought yourself that necklace, so when asked who bought it makes sense you would give yourself the credit.\n\nIf Nate cares so much about other\u2019s opinions he should\u2019ve bought it himself. He had plenty of time to, you even gave him cheaper alternatives. Enjoy your necklace!", "NTA and enjoy the necklace", "What?! NTA. Girl, treat yourself! So much better than having someone buy it for you anyway. Wear that necklace with pride. His insecurities are his damn problem.", "NTA for getting yourself something you want. Why on Earth should you wait for someone else to get it for you? If Nate's embarrassed, that's his problem. (and I don't think he HAD to get it for you either, but if he was going to get upset if you got it for yourself there is something wrong here)", "NTA. I don't think your bf likes you much. Breakup", "NTA \n\nWear the necklace and love it! Your boyfriend never had any interest or intention in getting it for you.", "NTA. First of all, good on you for getting yourself something you love, wanted, and could afford to\npurchase! I bought myself earrings that I love because I wanted to get myself such a gift (and my husband didn\u2019t get his undies in a twist over that). \n\nYou BF could\u2019ve saved for that gift. I understand money can be tight when you\u2019re a uni student\u2014but he also could\u2019ve saved and purchased it as a combo birthday, anniversary, Valentine\u2019s Day gift. Especially since he has saved and gotten himself tech/game gifts. He\u2019s embarrassed because people see that he was inconsiderate and didn\u2019t make the effort to get you what you\u2019d wanted even after you provided affordable options for him to gift you. Enjoy that necklace. You have nothing to apologize for.", "NTA. You did the right thing: buy stuff you like; don't wait for others to do so. You didn't embarrass Nate; he did that himself.", "NTA. But I would urge you in the strongest terms not to make this relationship your last. You are 20, you're in school, and it seems like you are developing a solid sense of self and a sturdy backbone. The world is wide. Nothing wrong with dating him right now. That's a learning and growth experience. But unless he does some serious emotional maturing between now and when you all graduate... Just...secure your birth control and do not be measuring him for the wedding tux.", "NTA Nate had more than enough time to buy you the necklace if he wanted to. Told him to suck it up next time buy the thing you ask for instead of getting mad when you get tired of waiting on him and buy it for yourself.", "NTA - but if you are looking for the side statement - BF is the ahole and you are not going to see it change.  I would always ask the wife what she wanted and would get it - all the way up to numerous horses (yes, the real animal).  Run - it won't change", "Nope NTA. You did absolutely nothing wrong to apologize for!! Nate\u2019s embarrassed because he has a few chances or more to buy the damn necklace and chose not to, now all your/his friends are giving shit for it.", "NTA he chose a ps5", "Come on. What is the internal conflict or dilemma here?!", "I\u2019m going with a soft ESH, but the stakes are pretty low. Nate sucks for wanting OP to apologise and for giving gifts that lack thought, OP\u2019s friends suck for teasing Nate for not buying a particular present, and OP sucks for not shutting down the friends and making it Nate\u2019s problem.", "YTA and SMH.

Window shopping in New York city in the 80s and my gf spotted a lovely Javanese silver necklace with stones. Beautiful intricate design and quite possibly a heirloom piece (this was well before the modern fake aged made in China replicas started turning up). I noted the shop and we continued with our 'wouldn't it be nice to be rich' window shopping around the Village. Few days later she was bedridden with quite bad flu... so I took the opportunity to buy her the expensive necklace while out grocery shopping. Hid it in my luggage.  \n  \n\nI'll never forget the look on her face when she opened her Christmas present a few months later.", "NTA.
