{"id": 21597, "submission_id": "14tb3rq", "title": "AITA for not trying harder to keep my kid quiet while my pregnant SIL sleeps?", "selftext": "3 weeks ago a tornado hit our valley and while it didn't hit our home, we did get a significant amount of flooding. My SIL agreed to let us all stay on her couches while my husband and the community go through and repair our home. Both my SIL and I are pregnant. I'm 29 weeks and she is 24 weeks. My younger son has ASD and he loudly stims a lot. I do my best to keep him away from the side of the house that my SIL sleeps, as she has a schedule as follows: in bed by 11pm, up at 6am, takes a nap at 10am to 2-3pm, cooks dinner at 5pm, takes another nap at 6pm-8pm and then is up until 11pm, when she goes to bed again. \n\nNow, we have been here for 2 weeks. During these 2 weeks whenever my SIL takes a nap, she has been leaving her 12yo ADHD child with me, which is generally no big deal but I myself am very tired. She also will take off to the store and not tell anyone where she's going, leaving her kid with me. And considering my SIL isn't charging us to be here (outside of buying food) I feel I have no room to tell her that I don't want to watch her kid all day every day. And it sucks too because she always says \"I'm just so pregnant and tired\" and dismisses the fact that I'm further along than she is and watching 3 kids so I'm also exhausted and pregnant. \n\nWell, yesterday I was so drained emotionally and physically. I could barely pull myself from the couch. At one point I must have fallen asleep because I woke up to my SILs husband scolding my son with ASD for being on the opposite end of the house and being loud while my SIL was sleeping. This did piss me off because this guy is literally never around to watch his kid or anything but scolds my kid and pregnancy hormones had me pissed over it. When SIL came downstairs 3 hours later she said \"what the fuck happened earlier?\" I asked what she meant and she said \"I woke up to your son screaming and my husband is now saying he can't handle having you guys here because I need sleep.\" So I kind of snapped and said \"you sleep literally all the fucking time while I have your kid so I don't want to hear that bullshit. We will leave, which means you'll have to find a new built in babysitter.\" I leave with my kids and go to a hotel and run it by my husband. He tells me he is already aware because his sister called flipping out about my attitude and said she \"never told us we had to leave\" and that her husband is just worried that she's not getting enough sleep and that I'm an AH for making her feel like a piece of shit for being tired and expressing her husband's concerns.\n\nETA: I DO have to watch the kid. Yes, the kid is 12. No, I shouldn't have to watch her. However, her mother doesn't even let her touch a butter knife to make her own sandwiches because \"she has ADHD and no impulse control and often lets her intrusive thoughts win so I don't want her unattended\". The first two times I was made to watch the child, I was asked and told specifically that the kid isn't even allowed outside unattended.

She's doing you a solid by letting you stay but honestly having to be quiet - AND PROVIDE CHILDCARE - for someone who naps 6 hours a day on top of 7 hours of sleep a night is excessive and their treatment of you unfair. It's especially telling that she's going to your husband to twist the situation and make you look bad. Stay in the hotel and maintain those boundaries.", "NTA Your sister in law informed you, in-between naps, that her husband doesn't think he can't handle having your family stay in their home  because she needs sleep. So you packed up your family, left and got a hotel room. \n\nWhy is she trying to back peddle? My guess the optics of kicking out a family whose home was damaged in a tornado looks bad. She can't pawn her child off on you any longer.

The fact that she\u2019s sleeping sooo much is unreal. Growing a human isn\u2019t easy. But that much sleep is ridiculous. I worked full time, took care of my kid and the house. Not saying some pregnancies aren\u2019t harder than others.  But when you have a second kid you either put them in care or suck it up.  Her nap schedule should be the exception not the every day.  \n\nYour NTA, taking care of kids is hard work.  Being out of his normal environment isn\u2019t going to be easy for your kid. Good luck. And sister is just trying to save face and get her helper back.   Only fair thing would be is if you each take turns watching and helping each other out with the kids.  And if she can\u2019t trust her 12 year old with a butter knife. They either need to get her on some better medication so she can focus and be trusted or take a parenting class for how to help their kid because that kids going to live with them forever at this point.", "NTA.

And honestly, like you said you are even further along. So why exactly does she deserve sleep but you don't? I would have done the same thing you did. The reason she is back-peddling now is because she realized she fucked up and isn't going to have you around to baby-sit anymore.", "NTA.

Getting out of there is the best way to deal with this. That lets you remove your obligations to her kid and you don't have to try harder to stop your kid from being loud. Get that stress out of your life.\n\nLet your husband know you've been run ragged taking care of the kids all day and that you need a break from it, so you don't want to stay there longer- because if you stay you'll feel obligated to make yourself and your kids good guests, and that includes a lot of stress for you.\n\nThat sort of stress is probably not good for your baby either.

Good for you.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nYou stay at that hotel. Relax. \n\nI have a daughter with ADHD. She's now 20 and doing just fine. At 12, damn straight she was making her own PB&J, because it was well within her capabilities. Is SIL worried that her \"precious\" daughter will stab someone with a butter knife? Seriously... impulse control should've been curbed by now if they'd been working on solutions rather being helicopters.\n\nI also have been diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia \\[close cousin to Narcolepsy\\], which means I've been sleepy my entire life without known cause. Believe me... I haven't slept as much as you've stated your SIL does since I was in elementary school. Even while pregnant, I had to work full time... so there was no way I could nap that much even though my body said I should. So, unless your SIL has Narcolepsy, Idiopathic Hypersomnia, SEVERE sleep apnea or SEVERE restless leg syndrome, she shouldn't be sleeping that much.", "I'm assuming it will cover the cost (I hope anyways). We have been waiting on a phone call back since it happened. Right now they are pretty backed up due to the damage to everyone's properties.", "I bet SIL is in there with a TV, her phone,  iPad and snacks.  She threw you under the bus to save herself. Watch your back with her in the future.  NTA", "Agreed. Unless you have some underlying issue, sleeping 13-14 hours/day isn't normal even if you're pregnant. She should probably talk to her doctor because something is off. And if her 12yo really can't be left alone, then she needs professional support because no 12yo (even one with ADHD) should have an issue using a butter knife or going outside on their own. Her mom just sounds overly controlling.\n\nYou did your best to keep your son quiet while your SIL was sleeping, but since she's sleeping ALL THE TIME that would mean keeping your son with special needs quiet all the time. Of course that can't happen. \n\nYes, it's her house and she can enforce whatever (asinine) rules she wants, so I'm glad you took the high road and just left. Maybe she didn't outright tell you to leave but she also didn't really leave you much choice.

She claims it's because her kid has ADHD and no impulse control and \"often lets her intrusive thoughts win\". She isn't allowed to even touch a butter knife without an adult standing over her. She is very heavily helicoptered. So the first two times she asked me to keep an eye on her kid. After that, she stopped asking at all.", "Did you miss the part where OP is also pregnant?

That means I've been excessively sleepy my entire life without a known reason. The last time I slept as much as OPs SIL, I was in elementary school.

No, it's not ideal, but with modern medicine, I've been able to get meds to help me feel \"normal\" throughout my day \\[which I got AFTER I had my kids\\].\n\nHaving said that, OP is absolutely NTA. I've got two kids I've birthed. My daughter is ADHD and is the older of the two. When I got pregnant with my son \\[5 years younger\\], heck yeah I was exhausted, but I worked full time and didn't have anyone to pawn my daughter off on after work. So, the SILs ability to stay awake and be a mother should NOT be an issue even though she and her husband have made it one.", "(NTA btw)\n\nI was a kid with autism and ADHD  and I actually went undiagnosed despite having moderate ADHD and autism.

(I\u2019m asking but she may present differently than your child, lots of autistic people present differently)\n\nThe only reason I ask is if she may run off when outside unattended or something as that can be a trait shown in autistic children. Is she not medicated? Because even if it\u2019s *just* ADHD, it seems pretty severe if her impulsivity is putting her in so much danger.
