And I'm sorry about that.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI(19F) am an Automobile Engineering (diploma) student. Most of  my lecturers and classmates are men. Also since it's a diploma course, there are students with age ranging from 16-25(or more, idk). I am one of the only two girls in the entire department.\n\nI always get really bad cramps around two weeks before my period actually starts. Sometimes, I get the cramps and it starts like the very next day but sometimes, I'm in pain for like 2 weeks before it starts. My cycle is also extremely irregular.\n\n**Context:**\n\nSo last week, during one of our labs, I shared a KitKat with my classmate. A little while later, another classmate asked if I had a pencil and it turned out I dropped it somewhere else in the bag. I finally found it in the pocket where I had a pack of 6 pads. My friend heard the rustling and just went: \"oh you got more KitKats? Really?\" So I just pulled the packet out and showed it to him and went \"does this look like fucking KitKats to you?\". Bro was horrified and apologised and I told him he was fine.\n\nToday, while I was in lab, I wanted to go to the toilet, got permission, got there, found out I got my period so I just walked back, got my pad and came out again. My lecturer was surprised and asked if I was alright so I just said \"oh I just wanted to get this\" and gestures to my pad in my hand. He smiled, said \"ok\" and I went to the toilet again. End of story.\n\n**The issue:**\n\nI was talking to my cousin and I mentioned both stories and I thought it was funny but my cousin just called me a weirdo and said that it was inappropriate. I don't like hiding my periods lie it's some sort of tabboo but it's not like I stood on a desk and waved my pads around. But my cousin told me that this was too far.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nETA:\nThe pads were folded and wrapped up\n\n***After reading a few comments, I'd like to make this clear:***\n\n**My classmate didn't mind the pads. He was just shocked. And we both actually laughed about it because another classmate who heard part of our convo while writing his lab notes just went(without looking) \"hey <my name> can I have a KitKat too?\"**", "created_utc": 1692025359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qx6es/aita_for_showing_my_pad_to_men/", "score": 293, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I'm sorry about that.\n\nBackground:\nI(19F) am an Automobile Engineering (diploma) student. Most of  my lecturers and classmates are men. Also since it's a diploma course, there are students with age ranging from 16-25(or more, idk). I am one of the only two girls in the entire department.\n\nI always get really bad cramps around two weeks before my period actually starts. Sometimes, I get the cramps and it starts like the very next day but sometimes, I'm in pain for like 2 weeks before it starts. My cycle is also extremely irregular.\n\nContext:\nSo last week, during one of our labs, I shared a KitKat with my classmate. A little while later, another classmate asked if I had a pencil and it turned out I dropped it somewhere else in the bag. I finally found it in the pocket where I had a pack of 6 pads. My friend heard the rustling and just went: \"oh you got more KitKats? Really?\" So I just pulled the packet out and showed it to him and went \"does this look like fucking KitKats to you?\". Bro was horrified and apologised and I told him he was fine.\n\nToday, while I was in lab, I wanted to go to the toilet, got permission, got there, found out I got my period so I just walked back, got my pad and came out again. My lecturer was surprised and asked if I was alright so I just said \"oh I just wanted to get this\" and gestures to my pad in my hand. He smiled, said \"ok\" and I went to the toilet again. End of story.\n\nThe issue:\nI was talking to my cousin and I mentioned both stories and I thought it was funny but my cousin just called me a weirdo and said that it was inappropriate. I don't like hiding my periods lie it's some sort of tabboo but it's not like I stood on a desk and waved my pads around.

Specifying defecation as your purpose would be weird.  Specifying urination is sometimes common.  Who knows what led to this kind of conditioning.", "LOL thanks. My comment had nothing to do about men and more about not walking around with sanitary products.

This is just an, ignore her silliness kinda situation then.", "I didn\u2019t see the other post, but yeah, those are completely different situations. It sounds like the other one wasn\u2019t about the period, it was about sharing news that wasn\u2019t his to share", "Sure there's differences, but there's also similarities. If you are going to blame a father for talking to his mother about his daughters period, then this suggests that her period is something taboo or private. That talking to a close family member about it is utterly inappropriate because of how personal and private it is.", "A man or woman talking about their own child is not inappropriate in my opinion. Maybe my family is just more open about these things, but we\u2019ve always openly discussed all normal body odors, functions, etc\u2026", "Yes. And also, just because something should be normalized doesn\u2019t mean we should shame the people who have been taught to feel shame about something for, you know, feeling shame about it. That\u2019s not progress.", "Not only that, the grandma shared the news with others in the family - totally horrible for the poor girl!  There are ways to be helpful and empowering but that ain't one of them.", ">But it may also make it uninteresting for others to talk about them.\n\nI don't see a negative there.", ">The daughter in question understandably wasn't as comfortable about her period as she'll surely be once she gets the chance to get accustomed to having them on her own time.\n\nYeah she wasn't comfortable because society has made this an uncomfortable space. Keep perpetuating it though. I don't have a period, I only try to speak on behalf of those that don't want the stigma and would like to live comfortably with their own periods.", "So if a kid farted in class and it was a really weird funny fart and even the kid was laughing and then the teacher smelled it and she puked. Would you not ever tell that story because of the bodily functions of someone else?

And I've always been a bit spacey and forgetful. My mum would get so mad at me if I accidentally left one (rolled up in tissue, mind you, so the bloody part of it weren't even visible) in the bathroom. I had no issue sorting it once someone let me know I forgot about it, but I always felt like it weren't something to get mad over. And, funnily enough, my stepdad didn't give a fuck. Hell, even when I would talk about stuff related to my period, my mum would be like \"[stepdad] is right there, he doesn't need to hear this\" and he would just be like \"yeah I don't actually care'", "Hehe thanks. My cat is really dumb like runs towards the enemy(other stray cats) when she was in danger and I stood there like \"wtf\"", "Well, you just said what I was thinking but didn\u2019t write.

We joke around...", "why on earth shouldn't she walk around with sanitary products? I mean, you pretty much have to , since they need changing several times a day.  They are all individually wrapped, it's no different to having a packet of kleenex or a bandaid, and in both cases other people were looking in her bag or asking what she had / where she was going. She's not being indiscreet by answering them! \n\nYour attitude is why people are embarrassed about periods, which has a whole bunch of negative results.", "But why? Literally everybody poops, after all.\n\nIt's not as if she changed her pad in front of the class. It was still contained, and not put on any sort of display.\n\nThere was nothing indiscrete about what she did. There would be nothing indiscrete about your hypothetical situation, either.\n\nDoes the fact that humans have biological needs make you uncomfortable or something?

Would you also reach for your smelling salts?", "But idk if it's because I usually go for unsweetened dark chocolates but I thought it was kinda too sweet.

It also doesn't mean EVERY human alive has to be comfortable speaking openly about it. \n\nPersonally, I'll tell anyone that I need to go take a shit, but I wouldn't announce to the dinner table that my friend just discretely told me they need to do the same, because my comfort level isn't the same as everyone else's. It's not hard, buddy. Try using some critical thinking skills, mate.", "It\u2019s not about the topic being taboo or not. The difference between those two questions is one of consent.
