And I'm sorry about that.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI(19F) am an Automobile Engineering (diploma) student. Most of  my lecturers and classmates are men. Also since it's a diploma course, there are students with age ranging from 16-25(or more, idk). I am one of the only two girls in the entire department.\n\nI always get really bad cramps around two weeks before my period actually starts. Sometimes, I get the cramps and it starts like the very next day but sometimes, I'm in pain for like 2 weeks before it starts. My cycle is also extremely irregular.\n\n**Context:**\n\nSo last week, during one of our labs, I shared a KitKat with my classmate. A little while later, another classmate asked if I had a pencil and it turned out I dropped it somewhere else in the bag. I finally found it in the pocket where I had a pack of 6 pads. My friend heard the rustling and just went: \"oh you got more KitKats? Really?\" So I just pulled the packet out and showed it to him and went \"does this look like fucking KitKats to you?\". Bro was horrified and apologised and I told him he was fine.\n\nToday, while I was in lab, I wanted to go to the toilet, got permission, got there, found out I got my period so I just walked back, got my pad and came out again. My lecturer was surprised and asked if I was alright so I just said \"oh I just wanted to get this\" and gestures to my pad in my hand. He smiled, said \"ok\" and I went to the toilet again. End of story.\n\n**The issue:**\n\nI was talking to my cousin and I mentioned both stories and I thought it was funny but my cousin just called me a weirdo and said that it was inappropriate. I don't like hiding my periods lie it's some sort of tabboo but it's not like I stood on a desk and waved my pads around. But my cousin told me that this was too far.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nETA:\nThe pads were folded and wrapped up\n\n***After reading a few comments, I'd like to make this clear:***\n\n**My classmate didn't mind the pads. He was just shocked. And we both actually laughed about it because another classmate who heard part of our convo while writing his lab notes just went(without looking) \"hey <my name> can I have a KitKat too?\"**", "created_utc": 1692025359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qx6es/aita_for_showing_my_pad_to_men/", "score": 3683, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
