DH plays soccer multiple times a week and tends to get home later, irritated that she\u2019s on the tablet. On to tonight, daughter was on the tablet about 1.5 hours until he got home from work (I was WFH) and we all started cleaning. An hour or so after this he got ready for football and stated to me the last few things he wanted her to do. I agreed and specifically agreed to no tablet. Anyway she finished cleaning (checked and happy) and I told her she could go back on her tablet while I was midway through dinner. She told me daddy took the tablet. I did a \u2018search\u2019 for the tablet only to discover it had been turned off so couldn\u2019t be found. He had turned it off and hidden it. We looked everywhere. I am furious he has undermined my parental choices and even when he got home would not return the tablet because of my \u2018attitude\u2019 (demanding) and found it amusing watching us search everywhere to find it. When I explained to him how upset I was that he felt he needed to undermine my parental decisions and if he didn\u2019t return it we would leave for the night, he told my daughter I was just \u2018having a tantrum\u2019.

Her parents were abusive fuckwads who were always fighting and abusive towards their children and each other. So she probably thinks this is what love is supposed to look like I guess. To her it must have been weird as hell to see my wife and me go the entire two months she stayed with us without getting mad and screaming at each other a single time.", "I hear you but have you read the OP\u2019s comments here? She\u2019s just as immature and toxic as he is. She also for the record admits the kid is doing better with less screens. On a grand scale of how women are STILL expected to do more of the lions share in the household I agree with you and the many other who have said the dad is the A H. But this is about these specific people and their messed up relationship. They are both A H and need to get help and do better for the sake of the kids.", "Except she still would have been an AH when she tried to give the tablet back before finishing everything (which is the only situation I said she could be an AH), which would have been very undermining.", "True, unfortunately lol", "She said the daughter finished what he said he wanted and she checked it, then said she could. So no undermining happened", "Okay? But we're talking about whether she would have been if that was the situation..."]}
