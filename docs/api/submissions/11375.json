DH plays soccer multiple times a week and tends to get home later, irritated that she\u2019s on the tablet. On to tonight, daughter was on the tablet about 1.5 hours until he got home from work (I was WFH) and we all started cleaning. An hour or so after this he got ready for football and stated to me the last few things he wanted her to do. I agreed and specifically agreed to no tablet. Anyway she finished cleaning (checked and happy) and I told her she could go back on her tablet while I was midway through dinner. She told me daddy took the tablet. I did a \u2018search\u2019 for the tablet only to discover it had been turned off so couldn\u2019t be found. He had turned it off and hidden it. We looked everywhere. I am furious he has undermined my parental choices and even when he got home would not return the tablet because of my \u2018attitude\u2019 (demanding) and found it amusing watching us search everywhere to find it. When I explained to him how upset I was that he felt he needed to undermine my parental decisions and if he didn\u2019t return it we would leave for the night, he told my daughter I was just \u2018having a tantrum\u2019.

Once the chores were done, Mom should have suggested a different entertainment idea that followed through with the agreement she made with her husband.", "If you replace tablet with TV the time spent probably wouldn't even sound so bad to him. \n\nBut he doesn't get to eff off and do whatever while you have to parent AND he makes the rules.", "Why not tell him that before, when he asked for \"no more tablet\" you, just said yes, and then went back on your word.\n\nHe's a dick, but you also lied.", "Dear husband", "Yeah, romanticizing toxicity always works so well.", "That sounds toxic as fuck, i feel for the damage you BOTH will put your kid through. \n\nBut in this case NTA", "\u201cHe is a walking red flag but I kind of am too\u201d is cute and romantic in fictional rom com movies and novels. In real life it\u2019s a recipe for disaster that hurts everyone around you. Definitely weird and concerning that you think about your relationship in these terms. NTA, but is this really how you want to live your life?", "This reply makes me terrified for your child in her future years.", "I hope you dont think this is normal...or healthy, because its not...", "I was \u2018quick\u2019 to anger because my ex used to invalidate me hella and wouldn\u2019t pull his weight so I got frustrated and hurt which projected into anger. \n\nI\u2019m just saying, not too late to get out and focus on building a healthy environment for you AND your daughter", "Are you familiar with the concept of codependence?", "I used to be like that, and you can change that cuz it ain't healthy sis. Get some fucking therapy, for the sake of your kid", "Please seek therapy or parenting classes if this this is an honest reflection. Your daughter deserves to have stable parents who display green flags, not red ones.", "For your child\u2019s sake, if you plan to stay with this man. Please seek therapy. You both sound incredibly toxic", "Ew", "His actions remind me of the AITA posts where an abusive person plays awful \"pranks\" on their partner.  Your spouse did this because he does not respect you, your time or your daughter's mental health.  Then he reaffirmed his lack of respect by calling it a tantrum.  I hope you see there are bigger issues here than this one-time incident.  Please seek couples therapy for your daughter's sake.  She is sick to her stomach watching this between the two of you.\n\nEdit;  NTA", "It\u2019s time for you both to grow up for the sake of your kids. Get some marriage counseling to help with your communication.", "Yea that apology is insincere. Its a \"sht she is actually leaving\" panic apology. To him he still feels justified.\n\nHonestly, looking at your comments I pity that poor kid. Growing up in a household where the parents are constantly arguing isn't great. Not to mention him f\\*cking off and playing football with his friends multiple times a week. He has a kid, he needs to pull his weight (which it doesn't seem like he is doing) and help parent rather than set some parenting rules you have to follow while he relaxes and watches.\n\nThe tablet isn't healthy, which you acknowledge, and honestly if he actually bothered taking care/playing with her then I honestly doubt that the tablet would be needed.", "How would you feel if your daughter grows up to marry a man who treats her like this?\n\nOr, how will you feel when your daughter is a teenager and is furious with you for staying with him and letting him treat you and her like this?\n\nBecause one if not both seem likely.", "That is a GREAT example for your daughter!!! She gets to learn that she is not allowed to have emotions and has to take the blame when someone is a giant AH to her!!!!\n\nChildren learn what love is as a kid... take this from someone with abusive parents who jumped from toxic relationship to toxic relationship... You are damaging her chances of finding a good partner. I was lucky enough to find one and he is so confused when I thank him for being a decent person... \n\nYour daughter deserves better.", "I don't know that you realize how terrifying this is to everyone reading. Your daughter is learning some horrible things about emotions and he sounds like a terrible partner", "Oh my I hope that\u2019s not what it means", "I have to disagree with your statement that no one ever has the right to invalidate your feelings. Some feelings can be incredibly unhealthy, like getting irrationally upset when someone cuts you off in traffic. Or what about people who feel sexually attracted to children? They actually feel that way, but those feelings are unhealthy.\n\nFeelings often lead to actions. If I get irrationally angry and never, ever say a cross word or act aggressively towards someone, I guess you could say that\u2019s objectively fine, but the reality is that if I feel irrationally angry on a regular basis, at least some of those times I\u2019m going to treat others poorly.\n\nWe need to evaluate our feelings, not just let them rule us.\n\nI\u2019m not saying your husband was fully in the right here. I agree with the ESH judgment, but we all need to examine our feelings rather than let them rule our actions.", "That seems an extreme response. Parenting is a partnership and, if both parents have agreed on a course of action, then both should discuss before changing course. (Excepting extenuating circumstances of which using a tablet is NOT one!)\n\nHow about when the kid is older. If they get grounded by both parents for some reason, then you\u2019re saying as soon as one parent is out of the house the other can unground the kid and that\u2019s ok?", "You literally say you agreed to no tablet, I\u2019m not sure why you feel like you have the right to back out on that agreement. This is deff an ESH.", "Seriously? There\u2019s two adults and one kid in the house. How much \u201ccleaning\u201d is required every single night? I was a single mom of four while working ft and in school ft and STILL had time for my kids. Priorities. The dad\u2019s priorities suck \u2026 but so do OP\u2019s.", "Just from OP\u2019s description, it sounds like hubby is one of those assholes that refers to his time with his kid as \u201cbabysitting.\u201d", "The fact that he found their frantic searching amusing is telling. If it were real concern he would step in and explain his concern and come up with solutions as a team. But he needed to remind them who\u2019s \u201cin charge.\u201d This is totally him just being controlling.", "No they agreed she couldn't have the tablet until AFTER her chores were done. She did them, they were checked and mom/op was happy with the results. He hid the tablet to be an ass.", "I think it was just no tablet until the daughter had finished her chores", "True, but then it seems like she had finished everything that he wanted her to do and OP was busy cooking. Bit unclear if they meant no tablet all night, or no tablet because X,Y and Z need finishing first. But let's assume all night, since the other situation would clearly make husband the AH.\n\nIn that situation, I don't see anything wrong with the plan changing a bit while OP finished preparing their food. Sometimes things change, especially when only 1 person is around.\n\nIf she hadn't finished everything else they agreed on, I'd say ESH (as his attitude and the way he spoke about \"having a tantrum\" is still AH behaviour). If everything was done, then NTA", "What I took from this is that father gets to go off and have recreational time, but also wants to dictate how OP deals with their child while he's off having fun.  \n\nIMO, if he wants a say and to make rules,  maybe he can like...stay home and help raise hia daughter.", "I went back and re-read and I still see it as agreeing to no tablet until she finished cleaning the tasks he asked her to do. OP agreed no tablet until those tasks were finished. Once daughter finished them, she was allowed back on the tablet. That's not OP undermining him. It would be if as soon as he stepped foot out the door, she went for the tablet before the daughter finished her cleaning tasks, but that's not what happened.", "I think you\u2019d have an argument here if DH wasn\u2019t spending so much time playing his hobby outside of the house. He works, comes home for an hour, leaves for football, then is home for maybe another hour (before bedtime? maybe two hours?). So he parents for two hours most days a week. He set a rule, and then expected OP to enforce it and find alternatives. I agree with you that we should stick by our word but if DH wants to set rules like a parent, he should probably be home more to actually *be* a parent. Work is necessary, football several times weekly is not.", "Agreeing to no tablet while chores and those activities are being done is not the same as agreeing to not allow the tablet until daddy dearest decides it\u2019s time. If DH wants to make rules and expectations around the use of electronics, he needs to be home to both enforce the rules and take care of his child so OP can do everything else that needs to be done.", "He found it funny to watch them search for a tablet he maliciously hid. \n\nI don\u2019t even care what else is happening here. That\u2019s incredibly manipulative", ">You say he was undermining you, but by agreeing to no tablet, then giving it to her anyway once he wasn't there, isn't that *you* undermining *him*?\n\nIt said OP agreed to no tablet until chores were done, and the chores were done. She held to the letter of a rule that only existed in the first place because he wanted it, even though it actively made her life harder.", "I think we found dad!", "How often do you think this man watches his child alone? I\u2019m gonna go with: incredibly rarely, seeing as he plays soccer after work \u201cmultiple times a week\u201d. He can start making rules when he actually does the work of enforcing them.", "In this case it might be dumbass husband or something more condemning, lol", "Here I thought it was Dad/Husband. \ud83d\ude02", "All of the yikes.", "\"We love with ferocity\" is just code for we are super duper toxic and we scream, yell, and fight with each other out of \"love\". Poor kid.", "\"We're both terrible!! Tee hee\"", "Or: how dare you not trust me to use my best judgement in the care for our daughter while you go play hobbies, you\u2019ve undermined me as your partner and shown your lack of trust.

His answer was \"she's having a moment and that's ok!

OP also apparently manages a lot while working, for the household. \n\nDad doesn\u2019t get to tell OP the parenting he wants her to do in his place while he waltzes out the door. If OP needs to make a quick decision different from what was previously established that\u2019s her right. \n\nDad then hides the tablet and once home, mocks OP and says he\u2019s enjoyed watching her search. \n\nThen he involves the child in the fight. He does that. So OP removes herself and the child from a situation that is not appropriate for a child. \n\nClearly the dad is far too comfortable throwing his weight around a household he is not as involved in, and I find your judgement to be unfair to OP.\n\nIt seems like to you the only way for OP to avoid being equally culpable was to simply accept the disrespect and not explain why she felt disrespected? And that\u2019s not ok for the child to witness either.", "True this was my train of thought", "[removed]", " \n\nThe latter argument turns into ugliness and I really sympathize with your daughter in this situation.", "going to have to borrow the dumbass instead of dear at some point. Thanks for the idea!", "OP describes herself as being volitale in comments. She also said that she took the opportunity to hide her husband\u2019s laptop during all this. This isn\u2019t a one way street. And there is a lot of grey area between arguing and disparaging each other to their daughter and being a doormat who allows disrespect. I mean, some healthy communication at any point would have gone a long way here in preventing the situation or in avoiding escalating it once it got started. The husband absolutely sounds insufferable though, so I totally get why OP is enraged. I still think that fighting about parenting, in front of the child, is grounds for an ESH judgment.", "Op agreed to no tablet.", "I guess we can agree to disagree. \n\n1. How much tablet time is too much? To me it sounds like too much. Kids found ways to occupy themselves without a tablet for literally all of human history until 5 seconds ago. \n\n2.
