DH plays soccer multiple times a week and tends to get home later, irritated that she\u2019s on the tablet. On to tonight, daughter was on the tablet about 1.5 hours until he got home from work (I was WFH) and we all started cleaning. An hour or so after this he got ready for football and stated to me the last few things he wanted her to do. I agreed and specifically agreed to no tablet. Anyway she finished cleaning (checked and happy) and I told her she could go back on her tablet while I was midway through dinner. She told me daddy took the tablet. I did a \u2018search\u2019 for the tablet only to discover it had been turned off so couldn\u2019t be found. He had turned it off and hidden it. We looked everywhere. I am furious he has undermined my parental choices and even when he got home would not return the tablet because of my \u2018attitude\u2019 (demanding) and found it amusing watching us search everywhere to find it. When I explained to him how upset I was that he felt he needed to undermine my parental decisions and if he didn\u2019t return it we would leave for the night, he told my daughter I was just \u2018having a tantrum\u2019.
