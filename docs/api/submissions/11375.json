DH plays soccer multiple times a week and tends to get home later, irritated that she\u2019s on the tablet. On to tonight, daughter was on the tablet about 1.5 hours until he got home from work (I was WFH) and we all started cleaning. An hour or so after this he got ready for football and stated to me the last few things he wanted her to do. I agreed and specifically agreed to no tablet. Anyway she finished cleaning (checked and happy) and I told her she could go back on her tablet while I was midway through dinner. She told me daddy took the tablet. I did a \u2018search\u2019 for the tablet only to discover it had been turned off so couldn\u2019t be found. He had turned it off and hidden it. We looked everywhere. I am furious he has undermined my parental choices and even when he got home would not return the tablet because of my \u2018attitude\u2019 (demanding) and found it amusing watching us search everywhere to find it. When I explained to him how upset I was that he felt he needed to undermine my parental decisions and if he didn\u2019t return it we would leave for the night, he told my daughter I was just \u2018having a tantrum\u2019.

No, YTA, I know I'll be downvoted to hell but if you don't agree to no tablet OP, tell your husband to fuck off, because by agreeing to it and then giving it to her anyway, that's exactly what you're doing and actively telling your daughter that the second he's not present, he and anything you agreed with him don't count.  Sure hope you are looking forward to his increasing distance and disinterest from parenting and husbanding, because his opinion apparently counts for bupkis in your household and he also cannot rely on any agreement for a second longer than you find it convenient.", ">He\u2019s barely present when he is around, loves his phone.\n\nYou can use that as a gambling chip for the compromise to go closer to your ideal, but you are both TA for not agreeing on a compromise so you can set a united front.", "Ah, so not only is he being controlling, making parenting decisions unilaterally and expecting you to uphold them, minimising your feelings and almost infantilising you, he's also trying to make your daughter see you as the problem.\n\nI'm guessing if you thought about it you'd see this behaviour in more than just this one instance.", "Do you think this behavior is healthy for your child to be witnessing?", "Definitively the best way to play ! You're playing with his own rules. It's the best way to state your point !", "That\u2019s fine, but this is literally just getting to a \u201che said she said\u201d. The only thing I\u2019m judging OP on is that she went ahead and gave the kid the tablet back, when under the assumption, the spouse said no more. OP hasn\u2019t specified (that I saw) that it was \u201cno more tablet for night\u201d or \u201cno more tablet until chores are done\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter if he went out with his friends or not, they both agreed no more tablet. That\u2019s all it is. I\u2019m not judging on anything aside from what was literally said in their original post. They were both wrong for how they handled the situation.  \n\nOP left out the second child in all of this, that\u2019s fine, it still literally comes down to \u201cwe both agreed to this\u201d. That\u2019s all. Would I have done the same? Probably, if a tablet keeps a kid quiet and occupied, then so be it. But it still wouldn\u2019t change the fact that they both agreed on something.", "That's as maybe, but your husband finding it funny when you continued to look for it? He's definitely more of the AH than you are.", "> *\"You are right\"*\n\nThey're really not, though.", "I have a vagina lol. I\u2019m a step mom to two wonderful kids, I absolutely understand the frustration OP is going through, I was there, and I did stuff just like this. We\u2019re 10 years in, compromise is SUPER essential in a long lasting relationship. We all have our moments, it\u2019s how we handle those moments that make us better parents in the long run. There is always room to improve, and learn from your past self.", "I get that, that\u2019s totally fine, but the way you worded your post was that he said no tablet (assuming for the night) and you agreed to that; that\u2019s where the issue is. If you\u2019re saying he only agreed to \u201cno tablet until chores are done\u201d then that\u2019s a different issue and would change my judgement", "I think that removing yourself and your daughter from the fighting was a good choice, as was allowing yourself time and space to cool down. I am going to leave my judgement though, simply because your daughter was present for all the fighting and especially because the fighting was about her. That\u2019s just\u2026. That is a lot for a six year old to hear and try to process.", "Agreed! That\u2019s why I said he handled it in the worst way possible. Everything you mentioned is part of why he handled it in the worst way possible. \n\nThat still doesn\u2019t mean using a tablet as a babysitter, and stealing his MacBook on the way out the door is the adult way to handle things. \n\nHence, ESH", "I don\u2019t disagree. Multiple times a week is excessive with two small children at home. I\u2019ve seen it a lot, but often the less active parent is actually unaware of how difficult it is to occupy young children for a long period of time. Dad may need to put in more work and maybe he and OP can come to a more agreeable solution", "3 is the age I hand them hot glue guns. I get the cooler melt point ones. \n\nAnother commenter mentioned dad should be watching the child instead of soccer. I think this also needs to be addressed as it sounds like he is out playing recreationally quite often. He may not fully understand how difficult it is to occupy children for long periods of time", "Op you have gotten many comments giving good advise, this... is not one of them.", "I saw that you took his macbook and I love it.", "this. it\u2019s so disgusting for him to say because mommys tantrum. Be a man, if you don\u2019t want your kid on the tablet say it to her face, don\u2019t blame\nmommy.", "Right?! It is absolutely not. A nightmare of two volatile parents who enjoy antagonizing each other with petty antics, using the child to get back at one another \u201cit\u2019s mommy\u2019s fault\u201d; \u201cwe\u2019re leaving because of daddy\u201d\n\nAwful.", "But then she took and hid his lap top, upping the ante with more pettiness and revenge. Everyone sucks here.", "I legitimately do not understand how you can consider OP T A H here.", "I disagree\n\n1. Tablet are not all bad, with the correct restrictions it's a good learning tool for a child. SInce she was not getting the support she needs from her husband it is the safest answer for her child since she's not unsupervised and doing anything physically dangerous. If you have a better idea please let OP know.\n\n2. taking the Mac book is just reimbursements for the iPad that she paid for and he stole. When removing yourself from what I would consider a controlling environment making sure if the situation gets worse you have leverage as the hurt party is completely reasonable.\n\nYes they may not be perfect, but I don't see them as AH behavior", "Thankyou", "Because it\u2019s all about what they both agreed to, as a couple. That\u2019s literally all there is to this. The added on complication was how they both reacted when OP found out he hid the tablet, and how he reacted about it (op states laughing as they\u2019re trying to find it, then telling the kid \u201cmommy\u2019s having a tantrum)   and how OP took his mac-book in retaliation.   In this situation, they\u2019re both acting immaturely, in front of their child. A child who WILL remember this. Was one more immature than the other? Absolutely, it still doesn\u2019t excuse OP\u2019s actions."]}
