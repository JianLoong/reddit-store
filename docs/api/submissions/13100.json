The only issue has been between a coworker (mid 20s F, Jenny) and me. She was not shy in letting me know that she is interested in me. I am, however, married. I have done my best to shut it down and told her that I'm very happy in my relationship and that I'm not interested in her. However, some of her friends have started referring to her as my \"work wife\" and me her \"work husband\". I have expressed my discomfort with this and have stopped responding when they say it.\n\nA little while back my coworkers and I went to a bar and throughout the night her friends kept trying to get us to hookup. At one point Jenny told me that my wife doesn't have to know. I was done at that point, went home, talked with my wife (she was very understandably hurt I didn't tell her about this sooner, but I didn't want to upset her, dumb reason ik) and came to the conclusion that I needed to go to HR.\n\nI told HR about the incident, told them I felt uncomfortable working with her in the future and that my other coworkers were encouraging it. I also gave them some correspondences I've had with her that were relevant. Over the course of the investigation, HR found more evidence of misconduct and ended up firing her for sexual harassment. I didn't expect that and just wanted her to be transferred or something. \n\nNow my coworkers are giving me the cold shoulder and walk on eggshells around me.

You did the right thing by reporting the inappropriate behavior to HR. You made it clear to your coworker that you were not interested and she continued to pursue you and make inappropriate comments. It's understandable that you would feel uncomfortable working with her in the future. HR investigated and found evidence of misconduct, ultimately leading to her termination. It's not your fault that she behaved inappropriately and violated company policies. Your coworkers may be upset because they were friends with her, but they should understand that her behavior was unacceptable in the workplace.", "NTA. It was sexual harassment. I'm not normally the type to say this because it's generally annoying to me when people do but...\n\nWhat if the roles were reversed? And it was a man telling a woman at her place of work that her husband doesn't have to know? That's not ok. So it's not ok for a woman to do either.", "Based on the info given NTA. At all.   \nYou were harassed and she met a consequence of that harassment. Sure... maybe you coulda, shoulda, woulda gone to HR sooner. But if you had told her even once you were not interested and she didn't drop it, the results would be the same.   \n\n\nSorry your coworkers are being awful", "NTA.  She was inappropriate. You asked her to stop. More inappropriate behavior happened.  You asked it to stop.  It didn't.  You gave plenty of chances.  At worst it's sexual harassment, at best it's Hostile Workplace, and it's against the law.\n\nYou did not get her fired. She got herself fired being inappropriate.\n\nYour coworkers will get past it, or move on.  Not your fault.", "NTA.  You didn't get her fired, she did.", "NTA\n\nSexual harassment is a terrible thing anywhere - especially in a work place. You followed all of the steps you could - asking her to stop multiple times, telling the wife, then going to HR - and while it could have most certainly been done sooner you did do the right thing.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nThis is a serious case of sexual harassment, to which the expected response is termination of employment. Your wife was absolutely right to suggest reporting to HR, and well done for stepping up. You shouldn't feel bad about Jenny losing her job. Maybe it's not what you wanted to happen, but it's her own fault for her despicable behaviour. Kudos to a competent HR team as well.\n\nWere her coworkers disciplined? Because they should have been. Not fired necessarily, but at least a formal warning.\n\nYour colleagues should walk on eggshells around you because you will quite rightly not tolerate any harassment. Maybe not the best working environment, but surely it's a lot better than them calling you \"work husband\" and actively encouraging you to cheat on your wife?\n\nPlease don't feel guilty, they're all as bad as each other. They treat the world like their soap opera playground.\n\nAlso please don't feel guilty about how you shared the news to your wife. She has a right to be upset about you not telling her sooner, and maybe you should have (although I understand it's never easy when you are being abused in the workplace), but you did tell her in the end and that's important.", "NTA You did the right thing. The fact that your coworkers were encouraging her is even more gross.", "NTA. \n\nYOU didn't get \"Jenny\" fired. Her inappropriate conduct and continued sexual harassment got her fired.", "NTA\n\nWhat happened to you is absolutely not ok and should never have happened.  You did the right thing in going to HR and letting them deal with it properly.  The other coworkers who were encouraging it should be disciplined as well.  \n\nThis was not some innocent misunderstanding but an intentional pattern of behaviour and its good she was fired.\n\nYou are absolutely not the AH here but she most definitely is.", "NTA and it's too bad those coworkers weren't so cautious before: their friend might still have a job.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nMarried or not, you made it clear that you're not interested in her. The friends are also AHs for trying to force you two together (again you are MARRIED)! Calling someone a \"work wife/husband\" without the other person's consent is sexual harassment.\n\nIf the tables were turned and a man was constantly trying to hook up with a female coworker and called her his \"work wife\", everyone would immediately hate him, and he would get fired. \n\nShe is more than capable to understand that what she was doing was inappropriate. I'm sorry your coworkers were enabling her behavior and giving you the cold shoulder.", "NTA", "NTA - you say HR found more evidence of your coworker's inappropriate behaviour in addition to what you reported - THIS is why they lost their job. If it had been an isolated incident I imagine there would have been less serious consequences, such as that person having to have a serious conversation with HR about proper workplace conduct. Maybe this has happened in the past and the coworker was on their last warning which they decided to disregard in their pursuit of you. \n\nAt the end of the day everyone should be able to work in a safe environment and it is pretty obvious that this was not happening. I'm sorry that everyone else is now treating you differently and I hope that things improve for you in the near future", "NTA.  She was guilty of sexual harassment.  No one should have to fend off unwanted advances and keep silent about it.", "NTA. \n\nThat kind of behavior is unacceptable in the workplace. Period. You repeatedly expressed your discomfort, and they chose not to change the behaviour. Maybe next time tell your wife right away though. Hiding things like that can be corrosive in a marriage.", "NTA. What exactly are they upset about? In their eyes, was the correct solution to sleep with her, or tolerate sexual harasssment? What a sad bunch of losers.", "NTA \n\nAs a 58 year old woman, I despise double standards. You absolutely did the right thing and your coworkers can suck it.", "NTA. This is definitely sexual harassment and completely inappropriate. You did the right thing in going to HR. Fuck these people who are apologizing for sexual harassment.", "NTA You didn't get your coworker fired. She got herself fired. As for your other coworkers? They can consider themselves lucky they could have been disciplined or even fired themselves for playing into the harassment.", "NTA.  That was totally sexual harassment.  Imagine if the shoe were on the other foot!\n\nYou're a good man and I'm guessing not hard on the eyes (i say this only because I'm an anonymous internet person, not a co-worker) given how she pursued you.  But best of all, you're devoted to your wife.\n\nAll your colleagues involved in this are the A  Hs.  You may need to go to HR again if their attitudes continue.  There is clearly a bad culture at your workplace.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Head up, eyes forward climb the ladder.", "NTA\n\nShe and her friends were sexually harassing you dude.\n\nHR found MORE evidence of her bad behavior, which is why they let her go.

You were sexually harassed. This is disgusting and unprofessional behavior. Also you didn\u2019t get her fired, she got herself fired for being a complete asshole.", "NTA, you were being harassed and apparently something else bad happened for them to fire her. If you keep getting issues from coworkers it might be worth letting HR know that training in what retaliation is might be good for the team.", "NTA. She and your colleagues made you extremely uncomfortable with her advances and them allowing her to continue/encouraging that behavior. You made it clear about your relationship and were already vocal of being uncomfortable about the \u201cwork wife/husband\u201d titles. They didn\u2019t stop and you deserve to work without being harassed.", "NTA.\n\nShe was sexually harassing you and her friends that encouraged it were accomplices. She had this coming. And your other coworkers should be uncomfortable because they had a part in it and could very well have been reprimanded too.", "NTA. What she was doing was sexual harassment, it's not ok. No one in this day and age can claim ignorance or anything else as an excuse for this behavior. It's not the 1960s, it's common knowledge now that this is wrong and can/will get your ass fired. You did exactly what you should have done: call it out, ask her to stop, and then report her when she didn't. Your coworkers need to learn some empathy and consider how they would have felt in your position before they judge you or give you a hard time.", "NTA. I'm sorry you were subjected to that. You deserve to feel safe at work", "This. I thought about how I've felt when men I've worked with behaved this way, and honestly it made my skin crawl. No one should ever be made to feel this way. Period.", "Not to mention, the encouragement of her \u201cfriends\u201d at work. They definitely assisted.", "Nice, add a little needless objectification to your post to a post of someone discussing how they were harassed.\n\nAs you state, imagine if the shoe was on the other foot.  You are a great women, I bet you are smoking hot given how he pursued you.\n\nPretty gross.", "I feel like the \"friends\" should get written up or suspension without pay.", "You sound like you need therapy", "Why? The other poster\u2019s comment was a completely unnecessary addition basically saying he should be happy for the attention he got. Hell no! He was crystal clear about not wanting it."]}
