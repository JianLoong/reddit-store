If this had been the only instance, I doubt Jenny would have been fired, but since HR's investigation found further misconduct, they decided that warranted her termination.\n\nYou didn't get Jenny fired. She got herself fired through her own actions and behavior toward her coworkers.

Perhaps she's already been transferred once. In any event, firing is the only thing that might teach her not to pursue married coworkers, or really any coworker.

I told her repeatedly about my boundaries, and it never helped. Everyone I worked with knew a little about it and said I should stop being so friendly. It makes me uncomfortable to be mean to people, I like making jokes and making the work day more enjoyable for my coworkers. \n\nMy 2nd day working with her and 1st day training under her went like this, \"are you sexually frustrated? I am, and I bet I could make you a chubby chaser.\" Then she showed me how she liked to lick the flavor of herself from her fingers. She would run her nails along my thigh, and I'd ask her to stop. She literally got me in a corner so I couldn't escape and then told me all the bad things her ex-husband did to her so I couldn't stay mad. They were horrible things.

If women are dainty little flowers who couldn't possibly do anything bad...then guess who gets shouldered with the responsibility over anything bad: men.\n\nSo I don't think men getting fucked over is \"misogyny\". It might *also* have an element of that, but I don't see how it's mainly about that. To me this sounds a little like that Hilary Clintin quote about women being the main victims of war because \"they lose their hudbands\".\n\n\n(I know, I know: her being a woman doesn't mean she can't also be misogynistic herself. But I think my point still stands)"]}
