It's understandable that you would feel uncomfortable working with her in the future. HR investigated and found evidence of misconduct, ultimately leading to her termination. It's not your fault that she behaved inappropriately and violated company policies.

At all.   \nYou were harassed and she met a consequence of that harassment. Sure... maybe you coulda, shoulda, woulda gone to HR sooner.

Your wife was absolutely right to suggest reporting to HR, and well done for stepping up. You shouldn't feel bad about Jenny losing her job.

Not fired necessarily, but at least a formal warning.\n\nYour colleagues should walk on eggshells around you because you will quite rightly not tolerate any harassment.

Calling someone a \"work wife/husband\" without the other person's consent is sexual harassment.\n\nIf the tables were turned and a man was constantly trying to hook up with a female coworker and called her his \"work wife\", everyone would immediately hate him, and he would get fired. \n\nShe is more than capable to understand that what she was doing was inappropriate. I'm sorry your coworkers were enabling her behavior and giving you the cold shoulder.", "NTA", "NTA - you say HR found more evidence of your coworker's inappropriate behaviour in addition to what you reported - THIS is why they lost their job.

Maybe this has happened in the past and the coworker was on their last warning which they decided to disregard in their pursuit of you. \n\nAt the end of the day everyone should be able to work in a safe environment and it is pretty obvious that this was not happening.

No one in this day and age can claim ignorance or anything else as an excuse for this behavior. It's not the 1960s, it's common knowledge now that this is wrong and can/will get your ass fired.

Jenny was harassing you, refused to stop when you told her directly, and continued acting inappropriately. That is the definition of sexual harassment and thus places it squarely in the territory of HR (HR has a legal obligation to prevent this since not doing so would open the company to liability). If this had been the only instance, I doubt Jenny would have been fired, but since HR's investigation found further misconduct, they decided that warranted her termination.\n\nYou didn't get Jenny fired. She got herself fired through her own actions and behavior toward her coworkers. In short, she fucked around and found out.\n\nAlso, I'm not by any means an expert in employment law, but I'd think that your coworkers being icy to you could possibly constitute retaliation, so it might be worth mentioning something to HR (not an expert, but if anyone could give their thoughts I'd appreciate it).", "NTA\n\nIf HR found other instances, i wonder if you're the first one she's taken an interest in? Perhaps she's already been transferred once. In any event, firing is the only thing that might teach her not to pursue married coworkers, or really any coworker. It's equally disturbing that your other coworkers were encouraging it. \n\nI'm glad HR fired her. It shows that they're taking complaints seriously. Your coworkers need to do their jobs and stop interfering in your home life.\n\nWhen someone in my husband's office was being a little creepy, he tacked pictures of us and me all over his cubicle. It worked.", "NTA. Sexual harassment should never be tolerated in the workplace. You did the right thing to protect yourself.", "NTA", "NTA. What a creep. You did good.", "NTA, if the situation were reversed and it was you acting that way towards you would be fired for the same reason and those same women would be calling for your head (I\u2019m at woman, just making a point)", "NTA. She deserved to experience some consequences for sexually harassing you.\n\nPlus, your coworkers are also terrible people for encouraging you to cheat on your wife. I don\u2019t think them giving you the cold shoulder is some great loss tbh. Sounds like a blessing in disguise!", "Sexual harassment is sexual harassment regardless of gender. You gave her ample opportunity to stop making those comments and tried to address it kindly, but going to HR was the right move and anything they found in the course of that investigation is her fault and hers alone. \n\nIf her little friends are walking on eggshells around you now, it makes me question whether they are also cute from the same cloth she is. If they have nothing to hide & are acting appropriately in the workplace, there is no reason to tiptoe around you because of this situation that you were very much the victim of. \n\nI feel for you because I know how uncomfortable this must\u2019ve been, and for it to have caused you and your wife any stress or upset isn\u2019t fair.

It's her own fault that she got fired.", "NTA just because the aggressor was a woman, doesn't make it any less valid.

You 100% did the right thing by setting a boundary, sticking to it, and taking further action when you ran out of options.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t get her fired, she did. You tried to shut her very inappropriate behavior down and it seems like she just kept escalating.

It may seem like you\u2019re nitpicking after this SH issue, but you are not.  People in a professional environment need to behave as such.  Jenny did this to herself, the coworkers egging it on are equally culpable and you are not at fault for their behavior.\n\nI would imagine some of the blowback is because you are male and, presumably, a little older than Jenny.  Sadly, our culture has not progressed to the point that all things are equal between gender and age.  It is especially sad in your situation as the harassment was blatant and *you* were obviously expected to just be ok with it.  It is not ok, none of it is.\n\nYour workplace should be somewhere you can feel perfectly safe and comfortable to be in daily.  If that is not happening, let HR do the work to make it such.
