Even if you could afford to buy you baby designer clothes, you would still be entitled to child support from you baby's father.\n\nYOu have every right to take you baby out, infact it's vital for her development to experience different environments", "NTA. Your ex just took up and left. Even if you were rich he should face consequences. And as for designer wear.. I often wish I had baby sized feet so I could buy cheap Jordans. Designer clothes for babies aren't even that expensive for someone who earns a decent living.", "1. Designer clothes for babies are just ridiculous.\n2. But free clothes are free. Your kid has to wear clothes, and these ones are free.\n3. Take photos of your baby. Babies grow so fast, it almost seems like they're a new person on a weekly basis.\n\nNTA, unless you're making a deliberate choice to only dress your baby in designer clothing.", "NTA. You should be legally entitled to child support (I am not a lawyer). How you dress your children has no bearing on that, regardless if you bought the clothes or not.", "NTA. Tell her that you can prove the clothes are free hand me downs and she can try to  make an issue over it in court.", "NTA - Child support payments are calculated based on the father\u2019s income, not the mother\u2019s fashion choices.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you bought the clothes or not. Children are entitled to the resources of BOTH their parents regardless. You and your kids aren't required to be starving beggars to be entitled to child support. Your ex and his mommy can go suck an egg.\n\nGood luck with your international child support battle. \n\nBut fwiw, it's never a good idea to post children on social media. They cannot consent to having a digital footprint, they can't consent to having their privacy invaded, and it's putting them on display for predators.", "Your ex's mother is wrong.  You are NOT greedy for expecting the baby's father to support HIS child.  Even if you were rich, he still needs to pay child support.  How you dress your baby is irrelevant.", "Definite NTA", "I mean if you want to rant that\u2019s one thing and you deserve to vent, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re genuinely unsure if you\u2019re the asshole.\n\nThis is a black and white case.", "NTA for only taking your baby to the or park or to the beach", "INFO\n\nYour mom says you are showing off. Are you? Are you intentionally posting pics of the baby wearing Gucci or whatever just to show off or is it just a coincidence?", "YTA. Exposing your minor child to social media make you that. And it seems that it invited crazy at your doors. It could play a role in fixing child support. Get proof that expensive items was given to you, set your social media to private and tell your lawyer. I'm sorry for saying your the asshole considering what those people put you through during a vulnerable situation. And I'm feeling for you. But You need to put this child first, because obviously, his paternal family are up to no good. I wish your baby and you all the best moving forward.", "NTA but it's pretty weird in general how you're showing off those clothes on your baby putting up a fake front. Your moral compass should have been going off before posting, \"Well I'm just pretending to be somebody I'm not.\" I could care less about worldly things, but hey, you got more significant problems at hand; best of luck getting something out of your ex.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Block her and anyone else who gives you grief. I'm sorry for your loss, that had to be heartbreaking. Your child deserves support from the sperm donor, whether he or his family likes it or not.

Clothes are hand me downs and BOTH parents are responsible for providing for their children.", "Not really, I post my baby wearing normal stuff too, but obviously when we go she wears the pretty stuff. \n\nThe thing is my friend who\u2019s baby mostly wears designer was born in April 2022, mine was born in April 2023 so she gave me all her stuff which there\u2019s brand new stuff with tags, it\u2019s a lot of stuff I even shared them with other mothers because I wouldn\u2019t be able to put all of them on my baby.", "Thanks and fair enough, but just saying I don\u2019t post her face at all, most of the pictures shows her legs hanging out the carrier/pram and in this case she was wearing a big logo onesie that displayed.", "As I said 90% of her wardrobe are designer clothes from my friends baby who\u2019s a year older and born in the same season, the other 10% are from next. I try to go through all the clothes I\u2019m handled before my baby grows, I\u2019m not pretending I\u2019m just trying to wear all I\u2019m gifted, but fair enough I should\u2019ve considered that point that people would judge me wrongly.

And she should ask for support--he had as much to do with creating the child as he did!", "You are not the asshole you should block the assholes and avoid social media as much as possible.", "Then absolutely NTA and further, even if you were spending money on expensive clothes, that doesn't mean her father isn't required to pay child support. I have even less sympathy for him since he apparently ghosted you while you were pregnant, so I'd say take him to the cleaners. It's guys like him, that haven't two brain cells to rub together, that give the rest of us normal guys a bad name.", "Well they found you, your child and a story they can spin. You have a custody battre to.win and i hope you do. Are your ex and in laws awfull people, in regards to your statement of facts they are. But you created this situation by exposing your c,hild to unsafe people. You're dealing with a war zone for now, so don't share anything with adverse parties and go to mama bear mode. Get legal advice on this matter, mine  is just mine.I think that if you can prove what you stated in your post you have a strong case in your favor but you gave them ammo. That's part on you . Like i said, i wish you and your child the best."]}
