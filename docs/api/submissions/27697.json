If he continues you need to have a SERIOUS talk with your mother. If she doesn\u2019t listen tell a teacher", "How is this even a question? No it's not appropriate for an 18 year old man to give his 13 year old sister a bath.", "NTA\ud83d\udea9\n\nThis is actually quite disturbing.", "NTA, you're a teenager, and I'm sure you're more than capable of doing it yourself. Sorry to say but that's creeper behaviour, he should know better.", "NTA. You can bathe yourself and his insistence on doing it is inappropriate.", "NTA Very inappropriate offer from your brother.  You can DIY.\n\nMake sure mom knows.  If not her, any other adult.", "NTA and considering your ages it is **extremely** weird that he wanted to do so.", "NTA - your mom just went to take a nap?! Are you sure she understood what he was insisting upon?! This is not ok and please do not let him tell you it is.", "Ew.  NTA  That's just creepy AF.", "NTA Wtf. This is just disturbing. You\u2019re 13. You don\u2019t need anyone to bathe you let alone you\u2019re 18 yo brother.", "NTA.  That's honestly very disturbing.  If your mom won't put a stop to this, you have to talk to another adult.", "NTA. You are 13 and your brother is a terrible horrible creep. Are you in the US or...?", "NTA. Your brother is not only an a-hole but also a predator. Your mom may be an a-hole too if she really is so indifferent and doesn\u2019t take immediate action to protect you.", "Boundaries. You can bathe yourself at 13. Your brother's 18? He should know better. NTA.", "Uh whaaaaaaaaaat? NTA and I\u2019m concerned about your brother\u2019s insistence on bathing you. Please talk to your mom about it", "Nta and wtf is this shit are you kidding me?  This is straight up fucking grooming behavior.  You need to tell an adult you can trust ASAP", "Sweetie, no. Tell your guidance counselor about this in the morning. Friends aren\u2019t enough for this one. It\u2019s weird that he offered at all, it\u2019s a glaring red flag that he pushed and pushed and tried to insist when you said no.", "NTA. This should set off huge warning bells for your mother!\n\nThis is bad and wrong. You are a teenager, you do not need to take a bath, can clean yourself, and do not need to be bathed?", "NTA- he is an 18 year old man. He has no business bathing a 13 year old. This is very concerning that it would even turn into an argument.", "NTA and major \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. You\u2019re old enough to bathe yourself. Your mother should NOT have just brushed it off. Talk to her. If not her then someone at school. This is not OK.", "NTA. If your mom won\u2019t take this seriously, get help from a responsible adult. Grandparents, teachers, close relatives, etc. This is creepy.", "NTA and his behavior is alarming. The insisting is absolutely over the line. Your mother is negligent as a parent for brushing it off.", "Your mother needs to step up and stop taking naps and fulfill her responsibility as a parent. Your brother isn't the parent and should have never been given that responsibility to this extent. In what world does a parent get to come home and take naps? Never in my experience - even if I'm exhausted. She's 36, not 70. \n\nIf she'd managed to stay awake and do her job, she may have realised this situation was *highly* inappropriate. A 13 year old girl does *not* need to get bathed by her teenage brother...ever. At most, he could have run a bath for you. That's it. The fact that he insisted so forcefully is disturbing.\n\nWhy did he need to take care of you? Were you sick or disabled? No. You lost a competition. Why would you need someone to wash you? The only time this would be justified is *if* you were hurt or injured and you requested assistance in a way you deemed appropriate.", "NTA. That's weird.", "NTA, no one should be bathing you at 13.", "Okay sweetie, you are old enough to bathe yourself. There is no reason for him to bathe you, and it makes you uncomfortable. That is enough. NO IS A FULL SENTENCE!", "NTA and you need some new friends if they think this is acceptable behavior. I\u2019m really worried about you. If anything is weird, please reach out to a trusted adult other than your mom because she has proven unreliable", "NTA and this is beyond creepy. It's extremely disturbing that your mom is brushing it off. It was weird for your brother to even offer, but his insistence and arguing with you is what takes it into really sketchy behavior. You're 13, not 3.", "I truly hope he just cares about you. Him fighting back on you not wanting him to bathe you is really weird and makes me feel deeply uncomfortable", "NTA and way creepy. You\u2019re high school age. Why\u2019s he insisting on seeing you naked? Talk to your school counselor about this. He needs help", "NTA. It could be that he is just missing being the caregiver, but you are growing up and even with your father, were he around, it would be appropriate to say no. It might be less of an issue if you were physically unable to bathe. Have a talk with him and explain that as you are developing, you need your privacy, that it was different when you were eight, and that while you love him dearly, you need your boundaries.", "NTA. Go straight to your mom, & if she doesn't take immediate action with your brother, tell a teacher. It's very very wrong for him to disregard your no. Then he argued with you about access to seeing & touching your *naked body.* This is wrong in no uncertain terms.", "NTA\n\nAnd if I were you I may try locking the doors of your bedroom at night. For all you know he's going in there and hiking up your pajamas and taking photos. Your brother needs some serious therapy before he hurts somebody because that is creepy and wrong and disgusting and could even be considered sexual assault", "NTA. Your body your choice. NGL, kind of creepy him demanding to bath you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

WTH did I just read???! Your brother was aruging with you about this.
