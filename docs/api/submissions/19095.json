None of this is to excuse or justify your dad\u2019s behavior, but confronting him directly like that right after the moment is not going to be productive and will only push him further into the mentality that caused the outburst in the first place.  As you know, it doesn\u2019t feel good to be acting out and I\u2019m sure your dad wishes he knew how to get his point across without getting so worked up to the point of getting out of control.  I suggest you try to connect first with his emotions\u2014ask him what he was feeling.  And acknowledge and validate his response.

At that point, you could gently say \u201cbtw, dad, you really went off on that poor guy.  Do you know that?\u201d  At this point, he is more likely to be self-reflective and think about his behavior and there might be an opportunity to discuss how to do things better next time.
