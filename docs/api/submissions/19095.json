My phone has been acting up recently so I switched phone companies and I was just going back to the phone store to end my phone contract with them. \n\nTurns out it\u2019s against the phone company\u2019s policy to switch companies WITHOUT ending your contract with them first. Because of that they were about to charge me the value of the phone ($1900). This was obviously a huge misunderstanding because my new phone company said there wouldn\u2019t be any issue with the old contract. \n\nAnyway, the guy at the phone store was explaining that I\u2019d have to pay etc and my dad started flipping out in his face saying that the other company said there wouldn\u2019t be an issue and that he was NOT paying. He was literally yelling in the poor guy\u2019s face. \n\nI work in retail so I know what it\u2019s like to work with awful customers so I told my dad to leave the store and I would handle the issue. Once he left I apologized on behalf of my dad and asked if I could speak to a manager. The manager came out and turns out it was an east fix, I ended my contract with them and didn\u2019t pay anything.\n\nOnce I was back home with my dad I straight up told him that his attitude in public is extremely embarrassing and the way he goes from 0-100 is something he needs to get a hold of. I told him he\u2019s a grown man and screaming at a guy at a store without listening is extremely childish. He then told me that I was being disrespectful to HIM and accusing him of having anger issues when he \u201cacts perfectly reasonably\u201d. Now I\u2019m \u201cgrounded\u201d for being \u201cmouthy\u201d and bratty. \n\nEdit: yes I still live at home, and him saying I\u2019m \u201cgrounded\u201d literally means nothing to me.

You addressing this with your dad is well within your prerogative.\n\nTHAT SAID, if I was the dad and I felt I was sticking up for my child, regardless if I am right or wrong, and my daughter told me to leave then later told me I was acting childish with what I was doing.
