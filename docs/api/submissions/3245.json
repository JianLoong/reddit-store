Since then, everything\u2019s been really great living together. However, my boyfriend has run into some financial issues. As a result, I ended up paying his share of the rent for one month, and both of our shares of the bills for two months. His car got totaled so he\u2019s been working up to buying a new one. At one point, I got a kitten. I paid for 100% of the kitten fees. I decided to do Rover for some extra income since I work from home and I have the time. I\u2019ve been booked quite a few times.\n\nThe problem is, my boyfriend wants a cut of what I make. I had initially asked his permission to have pets in the apartment and said it would only be cats and small dogs, and he agreed. He is out of the house from 8a-6p so he wouldn\u2019t take care of the animals but they would be there after he gets home from work. I agreed that it was also his space, the pets might wake him up/be in his way, and that I would give him 10% of my earnings. He wants more. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair because I do all the work, it\u2019s my account, and it\u2019s my face if there is any liability. Am I being stingy? Should I give him a bigger cut?\n\nEdit: Grammatical errors; added clarifying details", "created_utc": 1669425104, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4tyhn/aita_for_not_paying_my_partner_for_my_second_job/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
