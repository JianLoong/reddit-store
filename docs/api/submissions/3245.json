Since then, everything\u2019s been really great living together. However, my boyfriend has run into some financial issues. As a result, I ended up paying his share of the rent for one month, and both of our shares of the bills for two months. His car got totaled so he\u2019s been working up to buying a new one. At one point, I got a kitten. I paid for 100% of the kitten fees. I decided to do Rover for some extra income since I work from home and I have the time. I\u2019ve been booked quite a few times.\n\nThe problem is, my boyfriend wants a cut of what I make. I had initially asked his permission to have pets in the apartment and said it would only be cats and small dogs, and he agreed. He is out of the house from 8a-6p so he wouldn\u2019t take care of the animals but they would be there after he gets home from work. In his view, he\u2019d be coming home to a house of pets he might have to deal with. I agreed that it was also his space, the pets might wake him up/be in his way, and that I would give him 10% of my earnings. He wants more. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair because I do all the work, it\u2019s my account, and it\u2019s my face if there is any liability. Am I being stingy? Should I give him a bigger cut?\n\nEdit: Grammatical errors; added clarifying details; both of our names are on the lease", "created_utc": 1669425104, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4tyhn/aita_for_not_paying_my_partner_for_my_second_job/", "score": 317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is already something you're taking on to dig *him* out of *his* hole, if he has to help with that a little bit to facilitate his own rescue, *he owes you that*. \n\nIf he wants a roommate, he can get one. You're a partner. Doing partner things. \n\nNTA", "This walking red flag is already taking a cut of your income by having you basically pay all the bills.

Pimp", "Info: Whose name is actually on the lease for the apartment?", "NTA. Your convering his bills. Why would you OWE him money?? Throw that logic in his face? \n\nYou also need to sit down and discuss both your finances. You need to know what the other is doing with their money. If he says it's none of your business,  tell him your a couple. You should know about each other finances and spending/saving habits. Also your paying his bills, therefore you have every right.\n\nYou could be financially incompatible.  One of the top reasons couples break up! If you can't get on the same page, you never will. Walk away now.", "NTA! Please rethink your relationship!", "NTA but you guys don't sound compatible financially to the point of financial abuse. He wants your money, feels entitled to your money, why? He's not paying his half of the bills, and is charging you \"might deal with pets\" tax. Sounds like you are an ATM and not a partner.", "NTA. Honestly I think you should end the relationship. But if you want a pettier solution, demand he pay back what you paid on his share of the bills, including 10% interest for each day it remains unpaid in full. \n\nHe'll be owing you for the next 5 years, with or without the 10% of income he's expecting from you.", "Oh honey, you're so sweet, asking us if a 10%cut of your money is too little!\nYou don't owe any cut to anyone, expecially not to someone who makes you pay his shares of rent and bills.\nPlease learn to stand up for yourself, as it is you're bound to get exploited", "NTA", "NTA lose him. He is a jerk", "Wait what? How the heck did this guy manipulate you so extremely that you think it's okay for him to ask for part of your income when you're already covering all the bills? And even worse, make you feel like you need to ask the internet if you're a bad person for not giving him more? Cut this mooch off right now, he has zero right to claim ANYTHING you earn. If his response to you supporting him through financial difficulties is to demand more money from you, you're better off without him.", "You owe him nothing. He owes you plenty.\nIs he this selfish in intimate situations too?  \nGrudging givers are lousy lovers. That\u2019s a rule of life.\nYou can do so much better!\nNTA", "NTA, do NOT give him a cut of your pay. Not 10%, not 1%. Nothing.

You already are paying the rent and bills because he can\u2019t handle his money?\n\nHe demands a CUT of your pay?  Is he your pimp?  No, no, no, no!\n\nYou had to ask PERMISSION to get a cat?

It\u2019s not like the big is setting up the walks and pet care, so why in the ever living fuck does he think he should get a cut?

So one would assume that month was paid equally.  So OP has pretty much financed this guy's life since then. You'd think that alone would make her BF grateful but no, he's asking her for more $!", "Maybe I'm confused about the situation but I don't think he's demanding she pay for having a pet. He wants compensation for bringing strangers' animals into their jointly owned place. Rover is a pet-sitting service. I love animals so I would have no problem with it but I can somewhat understand if my partner took umbrage with me turning our home into this type of business.", "My point is he isn\u2019t suffering from the pets to be compensated. He\u2019s not being asked to do anything but exist next to a pet. Nothing is needed from him. \n\nWho gets paid for doing nothing, just because they are in the same location as a fledgling small business?\n\nRidiculous.", "This isn't OP having a pet.  This is OP running a boarding business.  That's not the same thing. \n\nThe BF is going to be sharing part of the burden since they are going to have these animals underfoot in his home with all the dirt, hair and smell that comes with it.  It isn't right that OP is going to make him live with that while she keeps 100% of the profit.", "Boyfriend is already getting *all* the money from her second job that she took on because he didn't have the money to pay his bills. He's *on top of that* asking her to pay him for the work he might have to do so his partner can bail him out.", "No, it doesn't make sense at all.  You haven't explained AT ALL your thought process behind why OP owes BF any cut whatsoever.  He's doing nothing.  He's put out in no way.  He's not her pimp.  He doesn't deserve even 1 penny, and he needs to get off his ass and pay back the rent and bills she fronted him off HIS OWN labor, not HERS.", "Bullshit. He is put out.  \n\nHousing animals is an imposition.  Especially animals that aren't used to being there which will be a lot higher maintenance, noisier, anxious and possibly even aggressive. Even if she's the one feeding them, they will still be underfoot, there will be noise, the house will be a lot dirtier, full of fur and might even start to stink.  For example, I would NOT be ok with my SO running a Rover boarding business our of our home because I just don't want that in my house, and I wouldn't even care if she offered me money for it. \n\nHere, OP is running a business boarding animals in their shared space. It affects him and he has to live with that burden while she takes the sole profit. That's not right. It is his home too. \n\nYeah, he's not her pimp, but he's not her sucker either.", "> For example, I would NOT be ok with my SO running a Rover boarding business our of our home because I just don't want that in my house, and I wouldn't even care if she offered me money for it. \n\nThen that's a conversation you have about your living situation, it's not an excuse to extort money from your SO's labor like a pimp.\n\n> It is his home too.\n\nA home for which he is paying no rent or bills.  If he doesn't like the animals, he can GTFO and start paying rent at a new place ... oh, wait.", "If your SO rented out a spare room in your shared space and you **both** had to live with a new roommate, but only they got the money, you'd be cool with that?  Absolute and total bullshit.  This is the exact same thing, with the only difference being she's boarding random dogs over the internet. \n\nAlso, he missed one rent payment and two months of bills after a car wreck. So he loses all voice in their home and relationship?  Wow, you have a seriously fucked up way of doing relationships.\n\nYou keep throwing around the idea of the BF acting like a pimp which is pretty ironic since you seem to think that OP should be considered to have bought all power over the relationship and the home because she paid rent for a month and bills for two.", "> So he loses all voice in their home and relationship?\n\nHe doesn't get to dictate that he gets to sit on his behind and pull a paycheck from his SO's labor.  Regardless of whether he behind on the rent, he doesn't get to do that.  That's not how relationships work - I don't fucking PAY my SO for use of SHARED space.\n\n> If your SO rented out a spare room in your shared space and you both had to live with a new roommate, but only they got the money, you'd be cool with that?\n\nNope, and I would move.  And that's his remedy.  Not to extract money from her for doing nothing, as you would have it.  Relationships require conversations sometimes, not just a unilateral PAY ME SUCKER, and sometimes the result of that conversation is that one party moves out.\n\n> Wow, you have a seriously fucked up way of doing relationships.\n\nMy relationships are not transactional.  If you feel like transactional relationships are the only non-fucked-up kind then ... well, I have nothing for you but pity."]}
