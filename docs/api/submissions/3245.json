Since then, everything\u2019s been really great living together. However, my boyfriend has run into some financial issues. As a result, I ended up paying his share of the rent for one month, and both of our shares of the bills for two months. His car got totaled so he\u2019s been working up to buying a new one. At one point, I got a kitten. I paid for 100% of the kitten fees. I decided to do Rover for some extra income since I work from home and I have the time. I\u2019ve been booked quite a few times.\n\nThe problem is, my boyfriend wants a cut of what I make. I had initially asked his permission to have pets in the apartment and said it would only be cats and small dogs, and he agreed. He is out of the house from 8a-6p so he wouldn\u2019t take care of the animals but they would be there after he gets home from work. In his view, he\u2019d be coming home to a house of pets he might have to deal with. I agreed that it was also his space, the pets might wake him up/be in his way, and that I would give him 10% of my earnings. He wants more. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair because I do all the work, it\u2019s my account, and it\u2019s my face if there is any liability. Am I being stingy? Should I give him a bigger cut?\n\nEdit: Grammatical errors; added clarifying details; both of our names are on the lease", "created_utc": 1669425104, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4tyhn/aita_for_not_paying_my_partner_for_my_second_job/", "score": 887, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get a better partner", "Semi unrelated.  I noticed your only other posts were to the \"barexam\" sub.  Am I to understand that you are trying to be a lawyer?   All the more reason to grow a spine... But now I'm even more confused because you seem to think he has some legal claim to your income.   Sounds like you need to ditch the guy and focus on your studies....", "Perhaps you read that incorrectly, as in \"No way! You are TA\" rather than \"(there's) no way you are TA\"?", "The right number is 0. You've already gave him enough.", "The amount should be zero. You are paying all the bills, which you shouldn\u2019t be doing anyway, regardless of a kitten. \nYou should be removing this mooch from your life. Clearly you can afford to live alone.", "What kind of flex is this? Oh, yeah, in my relationship, I'm the asshole. I bring people into the house and not only doesn't my partner expect to be consulted, he knows to giddy up and assist me after having worked all day. Someone else might want to consider a better *partner* as well.", "So basically, he paid his share once to make it look like he was wanting to be a proper partner, then he'll pay nothing more if he can get away with it.", "NTA \n\nYou paid his share of the rent 1 month and his share of all bills for two months. \n\nHas he paid you back yet?  And if the excuse is he is saving for his car sorry but that isn\u2019t a reason it is an excuse. He needs to save from his wages AFTER he pays all his bills and that includes what he owes you. \n\nAnd please do not merge any of your finances. And if you already have unmerge them. \n\nRealize he is saving for that car however that doesn\u2019t mean he gets to suck whatever funds he thinks he can from a job you are doing with no help from him. \n\nSo the answer to giving him any money from the job YOU are doing is a simple \u2018no\u2019.  As others have noted he isn\u2019t your pimp so he gets no cut from your labor.  \n\nIf he wants more money he can get a second job.  \n\nAnd if he keeps on about this you might want to reconsider your living situation. You indicated you moved in together but if both of you aren\u2019t on the lease whoever isn\u2019t could move out."]}
