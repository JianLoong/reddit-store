In large due to our age gap and that our father passed away when I was 2yo. I grew up with my mother and always saw myself as a single child. Even though my mother would talk about my siblings. \n\nStarting from when I was 14yo my siblings and I have made some attempts to create a relationship. But it has never worked. We are fundamental different people, and if we didn't share a family connection I would never have spent time with them. So we are low contact.\n\nI had a rocky start in my work life, having a degree i couldn't use. I got tavk to school for a new degree when i was 30. It worked out good and I'm today working a high paying job. \n\nFrom my days living on minimum wage and studying I have learnt to take care of my money. I was recently able to buy my own house,  I don't have children and no expensive hobbies.  All this adds up to me being able to put money away each month, which is a big deal for me. A security.\n\nWhen my father passed away we decided the inherentence so my mother (they were married) got 50% and us children split the other half equally.  My siblings didn't want any of the memorabilia my father collected.  Little value but cool things. I have them now.\n\nAny way. The other day my sister calls me. I'm a little taken aback but OK. I can live with awkward small talk for 20 min. Out of the blue she asks me if I have a will. I didn't think but just blurt our yes. \n\nShe then asks me if her and my brothers children \u00e4r the beneficiaries.  I'm honest and say no. I have met my brother's two girls once when I was about 20 yo. I have never met my sisters children.\n\nShe then starts to question who I will leave everything to. I say that father's memorabilia will go to a aviator museum. Some things will be given to close friends as they hold shared memories. The rest is to be sold and together with my savings be split evenly between an organisation helping people with alcohol and drug addiction and cancer research. \n\nMy sister is livid, telling me that that is money that can make a big diffrent in my siblings children's life. Sure, but I don't feel obligated to provide that for them. If I wanted to leave my money to someone it would be my bf's son. I have seen him grow up and been like an aunt to him.\n\nNow my brother is calling and saying that I'm being cruel and that I am stealing both the past and the future from his children.\n\nSo AITA for not including my siblings children in my will?", "created_utc": 1669325577, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3v7va/aita_for_not_including_my_siblings_children_in_my/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
