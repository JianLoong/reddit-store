My mom, who is battling cancer unfortunately,  is 83.\n\nSo I think I have a couple of good years left.", "Good. Then apparently your family is quite quite delusional. And greedy.", "NTA. It low key sounds like they\u2019re trying to off you and get your will and money. These people ate basically strangers to you.", "NTA. Cut them off. Also, don\u2019t discuss the contents of your will with people other than the actual beneficiaries.", "My sister is partnered but has no children.  She and her partner both have nieces and nephews (my children plus others).\n\nI have never asked her about her will or how she will leave her money (if she has any - she has a business and a mortgaged house but I have no idea of the equity).  I've never even thought about it until this thread.\n\nI assume she would leave anything to her partner, but who knows after that?  It's not my business, and she doesn't owe me or my kids anything.\n\nIt's a funny thing, but as my children grow up, my husband and I have both sort of ... taken responsibility for them?  Is that what we are supposed to do?  My eldest is 20 now and studying to get a degree and a career.  So he can take care of himself.  My younger children are considering what they want to do for careers.\n\nAre we doing it wrong? /s", "NTA. \n\nAlso your sister seems sketchy. The phone call definitely sent some \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. I would definitely go no contact with both siblings.", "NTA. Something smells fishy. Maybe you and your mom should get a police blotter or smth. They are planning things.", "NTA tell the sister to rack off and get an Iranian yogurt for her trouble.", "INFO - how much money do you actually have? Are your siblings wildly inflating the actual amount? Who told them that you have money to begin with?\n\nThese virtual strangers aren't entitled to your money. Surely their kids are around your age or just a little younger. They are not toddlers who need the money. Their parents can leave them whatever and they can go work like everybody else.\n\nTell your siblings that you have no intention of leaving anything to people you have no relationship with and block them.", "Nta", "NTA. just giggle and hang up when they call. The bridge is already burnt. They only want your money.", "Are they going to kill you off?? \ud83e\udd23 Why else woudl they be so pressed about a will. NTA", "INFO: Did I miss the part where OP is dying or something? She\u2019s 39\u2026Why are they even asking about the will??", "NTA. Who does this?? Whoever you choose to leave money to is your business.", "**''I'm being cruel and that I am stealing both the past and the future from his children.''**\n\n1.it wasn't theirs anyway\n\n2. you met two of them over 10 years ago and not met the others\n\n3. tell them to stick it up their backsides", "NTA you are not responsible for their children. Yes they are related to you\u2026 but you are not responsible for them. Their parents are. FULL STOP. \nThey shouldn\u2019t have had them if they couldn\u2019t take care of them- yes circumstances change for anyone but you are still not responsible.\nThey are not asking for a simple loan, they are asking that you fund their lifestyle. \n\nYou do whatever you want with your money.\n\nPs. It\u2019s not the memorabilia they interested in\u2026 cos they don\u2019t care about your fathers or your interests. It\u2019s the cold hard cash they want", "NTA. Seriously who asks people about their wills and feels entitled when they don't like the answer?! \n\nMy siblings and I are incredibly close and not even then would any of us feel entitled to ask or suggest what the other did with their money now or in the future....", "NTA. It's ridiculous that your half siblings who are 20 years older than you are anticipating your death and how it will benefit them and their children. Since it seems like you already have very low contact with them, just cut it off completely.", "NTA.  They just sealed their fate.  No SOUP for YOU!!!", "Be scared the are planning to eliminate you for your riches!/s . But seriously who does this they are half siblings you barely speak with whose children you would struggle to pick out of a police lineup. Just no. Honestly I would leave them a singular dollar,pound, euro or yen whatever your currency is as a prevention to contesting your will and then forget about them arseholes. NTA", "NTA\n\nyou are only 39, but it is inappropriate at ANY age to just call someone up out of the blue and ask about their will. you should make it clear that your will is not any of their business and they've just ruined any chance at being included in it even if you make future changes to it.\n\nshe only called to find out about your money situation. if she had any interest in building any kind of relationship with you, she would have never brought it up.", "NTA. I would be putting stuff in writing that you definitely are not leaving them anything in case the kids grow up thinking they\u2019re entitled to something and try to contest the will when you pass. Hopefully the kids are better people than their parents\u2026 but nature vs nurture and all\u2026.", "Hey thanks for donating to DNA. \"Drugs n alcohol\" it'd something worth investing in. Not your asshoke sister.", "NTA, and fuck's sake, you're what, two decades older than their kids or less? Even if, for the sake of argument, you actually did do this, how is it going to change their lives to get a quarter of your money each (or less, not sure how many kids your sister has) when they're already retired? Inheriting from you will not put them through college or help them house their children. It might give them a more comfortable retirement, and that is a wonderful thing to give if you were so inclined, but it's not going to change the overall progression of their lives.", "NTA. I am also a child-free person and my two nieces & my nephew are going to get nearly everything when I die, but I am VERY close to them. It's your money, you worked for it, it's up to you who gets it. It's also extremely presumptuous for anyone, including a sister, to call you out of a blue and ask who you're leaving your money too. It's really nobody's business unless you choose to tell them and frankly I wouldn't be taking any calls from your siblings for a while because their behavior is really inappropriate and suspect. Are the kids ready to start college or get married or something and they figured they could dip into their \"inheritance\" now?", "NTA. You\u2019re not stealing anything that ever belonged to those people. Don\u2019t give them a dime. What a bunch of greedy grabbers!", "NTA. Now she's lost her reason  to kill you and hide your body. She'll have to make new plans for Christmas.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your money, leave it to who you want for what you want.", "NTA... Frankly they are AH's for asking", "This is nuts. You're 39. Barring any illness or accident (I certainly hope you're well OP), your siblings' children will be *well* into adulthood before the prospect of inheritance from you becomes relevant to them. Probably parents themselves. Maybe grandparents! If your siblings are expecting inheritance from you to secure their children's future when you are young and their children, based on siblings' ages, are probably already adults, that's insane. If we assume your nieces and nephews are teenagers now, or in their twenties, and you live another forty years let's say, they will be in their fifties or sixties before your will is read! They sure as heck better have a plan for their futures well before then!! \n \nRegardless, this is a strange expectation for your siblings to have, and a strange thing for them to be pressuring you about out of the clear blue sky. They are not entitled to anything from you, and their behavior is wildly inappropriate. You have no relationship with their kids, and you are absolutely justified in making your legacy something meaningful to you.\n\nNTA", "The only thing you did wrong was tell her anything about your finances. It's your money and you can leave it to three legged circus dogs if you want. In the future, only discuss something this personal with your partner and your lawyer.", "NTA. You are 39 you could live for another 50 years, why do they care who will get your money then?! Block their numbers", "NTA.  I am just shocked all of this even occurred. I prob would block them from further communications", "You", "NTA. I'm also CF and not leaving anything to my sibling's children. It's your stuff, you get to decide what to do with it. No one should be relying on inheritance like that. I agree with other commenters, this is very strange out of the blue. Be on guard for shenanigans.", "NTA - Are you kidding me?! The entitlement here is mind boggling! You don\u2019t even have a relationship with these children!", "Lie. Tell them you thought about it and changed the Will in the condition that they never contact you again. NTA", "Exactly.  It\u2019s pretty weird to ring up a sibling out of the blue and ask them about their will.", "People who know you have money and want a piece of it.\n\nGreed is a helluva drug.", "Yeah surprisingly lots of people do. And the question about what's in the will is always just the opening - it invariably turns into a demand or complaint.", ">They had no problem taking their portion of the estate....and you were a minor.\n\nI\u2019d bet money this is actually where the problems started. From the half-siblings point of view, dad\u2019s *new* family got 2/3 of his estate, while his old family had to settle for 1/3. They still feel resentful of that even years later, and in their minds OP should be making up for some of that injustice through her own will.", "She's only 39. They may wait (if even in the will) a long time", "this is the answer.", "There was a post a while back from a man who thought he his cancer was terminal but then he recovered. At a celebration for his healing, his nephew mentioned offhand that he and his parents were so bummed that OP survived because they were already making plans do with his inheritance. I really hope OP disinherited them.\n\nYour money is to do with what you want. You don\u2019t owe them anything and I would recommend telling your stepsister that bc of her comment you definitely are not giving them anything. Since you don\u2019t have any children I really would recommend making your will ironclad so there is a definite beneficiary and they can\u2019t contest it.", "Who says they'll wait? Anyone starting conversations like this, never getting a penny for own basic security.", "Some people are fine with waiting, especially if they know there is a payday.", "If I recall correctly, the kids weren't even in the will for much at that point as the guy had a long term girlfriend.", "He did and proposed to his gf of 13 years. https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/ya361o/oops\\_family\\_seems\\_disappointed\\_that\\_he\\_beat\\_his/", "I heard he proposed to his girlfriend so his relatives being bummed made him marry the one person who was actually happy he'd live so now she'll be his heir.", "Oh goood!"]}
