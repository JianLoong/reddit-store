When the baby came, I was around to make sure my mom was alright, and then I mostly kept out of the house until it was time for me to leave for college.\n\nSince I've been at college, my parents have continually asked if I was coming home for break. I went back once (for winter break) and the entire time, it was baby-centered. The house was constantly filled with the baby crying, or the sound of cartoons, or my parents asking me to help care for the baby. Everything was interrupted by the baby. If I wanted to go to a restaurant with my parents- we can't because of the baby. If I wanted to go shopping- we're too tired because of the baby.

I suspect they want you to feel responsible for your sister, so in a few years, when you'll have a job, you will take care of her, for example you would take her on trips, buy stuff, contribute to college fund... It looks like they're preparing you to be a replacement parent in a future.", "Nta it's not your place to help with their bad decision", "NTA. I wonder what their expectations were at the age of 18. Even if they really wanted to be so involved with a baby at that age, it doesn't mean that you want that.", "NTA your responsibility is your life and studies at the moment. Not taking care of a child you didn't make. Take care of yourself and future. It is alright to help out once in a while, but it should not be an expected task of you. Go live and do not feel guilty. I know how they used to make me feel guilt and shame for leaving family behind when I only wanted to follow the path of my own life. Still to this day it sounds selfish to me when I say it. But it isn't your responsibility.", "NTA you\u2019re an adult and you can choose what you want to do!", "NTA - you\u2019re a grown up, you can do what you want. However, you definitely have some issues about the new baby and you may want to try and figure it out.", "NTA and its like your parents want you more as the baby sitter than the bonding. With about 18 years in between, the amount of bonding you are going to have is going to be pretty slim as you would be from a totally different generation. Its time you focused on your life and did things a young adult would do than a young single mom. Also at this age the baby wouldn't know or remember who looked after her/ him anyway. Its wise to do as you feel and let your parents deal with the baby until the baby is 2-3 years old when you can have a lot more fun. Also with the college and classes you want home to be a place where you can relax, not do full time mommy shifts tiring you even more. Enjoy your life and let your parents deal with their responsibility if that's how you feel. You don't have to feel bad about anything as you have a life as well.", "NTA, its not your responsibility to help them raise a baby. Too often families place that burden on their daughters. \nIf they want a baby sitter they can pay for one. Bonding my ass. They want unpaid labor.", "nta\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou're not their free babysitter", "NTA, your reaction is totally understandable. Nothing wrong with it", "NTA as is it not your job to raise the kid they choose to have. \n\nInfo: Would you be able to visit while staying at a relative's or friend's place?", "NTA - their baby, their responsibility. I mean first weeks are not easy, but you can't put that burden on your other children.\n\nI just had baby 3, and despite not asking anything to number 1 and 2, they already have to do lots of compromise because yes, a baby cries and it's annoying, they need to refrain from shouting when baby sleeps, I stay home with baby instead of going out with them etc... It's a lot. It seems your parents are not acknowledging this part of their decision, and I can imagine why this is putting you off.\n\nYou could try to explain that to them, and ask them to make time for you, while someone else babysits your sister.", "NTA, but perhaps tell your parents how you truly feel about this, so they can understand.", "NTA. You're an adult and in college. You have plenty on your plate as it is without having to also care for a child that isn't yours. This issue here really is that your parents made the decision to have another child, and they expect you to help them raise it. That's massively selfish of them as you're now a young adult, going to college.\n\nIt sounds like their constant inquiring about if you were coming back was less of an inquiry in their minds, and more telling telling you they want you to come back and \"bond\" and by bond I mean take over their duties because they're tired from the consequences of their own actions.", "NTA - but I think you may have some unresolved issues here regarding your parents having a new baby", "NTA. I understand that they may be disappointed by your lack of engagement, but it also feels like they are being a little oblivious in accepting your feelings. Explain how you feel. If they try to maneuver or manipulate, point that at. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you wanted a baby, you would have one \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.

Make plans or you will be saddled with this kid for years.", "NTA but you might want to look at yourself to see why you\u2019re so negative about the baby.", "NTA, I wouldn't go either, it's not your baby and clearly you don't currently enjoy being around your family, sounds like they mostly just want you there to be an unpaid babysitter, their whole bonding argument doesn't make sense to me at all, your bond will be better if you're not being pushed to take care of her and you can't form much of a relationship until the baby's older.", "Lots of people are going to say you're not TA and I'm sure I'll get downvoted but yes, YTA\n\nIt's okay to be envious that your parents had another baby and it may feel like they're \"replacing\" you. You sound hurt and a bit resentful. They're not, though, and that's what all this pressure to come home and spend time with them and your sister is about -- they want you to feel part of this new part of their lives just as you always have been.\n\nIt's okay to talk to them and explain that you're not so keen to spend time with the baby and you'd like to hang out with them -- together or individually. Yes, things at home are different now. But you're a grown up (almost) and avoiding them instead of using words could backfire.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell them you can bond later with the baby when they are old enough to remember you. You are clearly being asked to spend your downtime on childcare.", "NTA you will need to bond with your sibling at some point. But you are across the country and have other priorities. Honestly this situation stresses me out so much - I personally believe your parents should not have done this. When the child is 18 and they are old, who will care for the child? Responsibility may fall on you. But the deed is done, and now there\u2019s a little helpless human being in the mix.", "NTA don't like them parentify you for the sake of a sibling 17 years your junior. You're in college. Enjoy and make the most of this time in your life.", "INFO\n\nDid they help you pay for college? I'm asking because that part of this was left out and that's going to make or break my decision about who the asshole is.\n\nIf they have helped you pay for college and they've been supportive of you in getting your education, you're being kind of an asshole for not trying to return the favor in what little ways you can. \n\nIf you paid for college yourself or took out a loan or what not, I would say the parents are in the wrong for expecting you to be their support system on top of you taking out debt or needing to manage your grades to succeed in college.\n\nSo my answer is based on that. \n\nYou didn't mention who is paying so I'm assuming they are.", "They're almost fifty, so not exactly young.

I've been in a good amount of therapy due to my childhood and the way I've been raised, but I don't think those issues will ever truly go away.", "Agree with this. First comment to go into the nuance of the situation. \n\nAlso what\u2019s with this sub and the aversion for kids to help out with siblings? In this case it seems like the kind thing to do, parents are obviously overwhelmed and maybe taking the baby with you to the store can help them? It\u2019s a little like parents are not entitled to any compassion or help from their kids, I don\u2019t get it. If someone I love asks me for help, whatever it is, I\u2019m most likely doing it. In this case I would be helping without them asking.", "Them paying has nothing to do with them wanting a free babysitter for the baby THEY chose to have.", "It's a mix- they are contributing to helping pay for college. The rest is covered by scholarships, my other relatives, and financial aid. I'm also trying to work and find internships so that I can either contribute or create savings.", "Nope! It doesn't matter if they're paying for her education. She is not their babysitter! They chose to have another child so it's their responsibility to take care of it.\n\nChildren don't owe their parents anything! Not a damn thing!", "Exactly. By the time she goes to college they'll be close to 70 and probably retired. When she decides to get married they may be no longer alive... They need someone who will take over their duties. Don't be that person. \n\nMaybe you could talk with them about your sister? Do they have any plans to secure her future? Or do they see you as a Plan B for everything?", "No. It definitely does.\n\nThem paying means that she will not have the economic burden of student debt and can start her professional career with a clean slate.\n\nYou don't get to take a handout and then pretend you're not being shitty for not returning the favor to your parents.\n\nDo you have any idea how many Americans would kill to leave college without debt? It's sickening how many people are left to start life in the red. If she doesn't have that burden and is \"annoyed\" by her parents, she shouldn't have accepted the handout.", "Fair enough.\n\nYou're 100% entitled to your time but you also need to communicate that to your parents. If you're trying to work and find internships, that's absolutely valid and you need that experience straight away out of college.\n\nThat said, you also have to recognize they took a hit helping to support you in going to college.\n\nThey didn't need to do that at all. My parents didn't and I had to get by on scholarships and whatever side-money I could get.\n\nThat money could have very well gone toward a babysitter. You get what I'm saying? You have a right to your time but you also have to recognize the blessing they gave you in taking some of the financial burden off of your shoulders so you could get an education.", ">Children don't owe their parents anything! Not a damn thing!\r  \n\r\n\nSpoken like a 12 year old who got dragged to church when he wanted to play Call of Duty.", "They didn't even have plans to secure my future lol. (they actually didn't know who I'd go to if something happened to them) Now that you bring that up, it seems pretty likely that they'd want me to be the guardian if anything happened to them (which I'm absolutely not up for).", "No! It's not a \"hand out\"! It's their responsibility to take care of their children and that includes financially!", "I can acknowledge that- I am really grateful for the money that they're putting toward my education. Honestly, when I get a job and am financially stable, my first goal afterwards is to pay them back for that. At the same time, I'm struggling with burnout and exhaustion already, and it's somewhat hard to be sympathetic to a burden they took on themselves (the baby) when I also feel like I've sacrificed a good part of my childhood reaching the goalposts and standards that my parents set and expected.", "I'm female and not one tiny bit religious and I'm an adult who has children who also doesn't think my children owe me anything simply because I chose to have them.", "Firstly, NTA at all. Secondly - this is definitely a conversation you need to have with them so that alternate arrangements can be made in that eventuality. Not fair at all to assume that you'd want to be free childcare for their life choices (we all question our life choices from time to time, but adults tend to try to minimise the impact on others). Good luck with academia, good luck with the pickle you seem to be in and hopefully a resolution can be found.", "Again, 100% valid. The burnout is real and everyone in college deals with that.\n\nYou just have to make sure you're communicating this right. If you just say \"I'm busy and I'm not coming back\" but don't explain what you're dealing with and what you're feeling, you can't expect them to sympathize with your situation.\n\nLets be real. They're both adults and they had one baby already (you). They knew damn well what kind of a responsibility that was going to be. If they couldn't handle that it was a poor choice to make, especially as older parents.\n\nThat said, you also made mistakes I'm sure. They probably still were there by you and did what they could even if you didn't always make the best decision.\n\nThat's all I'm trying to get at. You all obviously love each other and I can guarantee you're going to be a great sister to that baby. I feel like the core of this is a lack of speaking your real feelings.", "Because girls can't play COD. That's against the law, apparently where you're from.\n\nLOL", "NTA. You can do whatever you want on break and if this is how it has been going home I don't really blame you. But babies change a lot very quickly, once she hits 1-2 she's probably going to be adorable and you can really bond with it. Don't cheat yourself out of that experience because you have issues with your parents. You can still haves special bond with it and proud you'll get to a point where you WANT to be the baby's guardian.", "Nta. This makes sense to me.  I'm too old to have more kids but if I brought a challenging situation into my life I wouldn't make demands on college/post college kids like this:  they need to let you accept your new sibling organically", "YTA, but not for wanting to do something else for spring break. YTA for being immature about the new baby. You\u2019re jealous that the baby has taken your parents attention away from you. You\u2019re afraid that they had another baby because you weren\u2019t enough and now they love you less. This is textbook reaction for a child, so I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, except you\u2019re in college so I expect you to act more like an adult. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that your parents want you to come home for break. That means they love you and they want to spend time with you. They want you to be a part of your baby sibling\u2019s life. They had such a good experience raising you that they decided to do it again. That baby is going to absolutely **idolize** you. But it\u2019s ok to spend your spring break doing something else. That won\u2019t stop your parents from talking about you constantly to your new sibling as they grow up. That baby is going to love and admire you so much! Even more than they would if you were closer in age. \n\nIf you ever have a baby you are going to be eating your words. You yelled at your parents because the baby is acting like a baby. Babies cry. They\u2019re high maintenance. They take a LOT of time and attention. And you will be lucky to have a support system around you to help you out if you ever decide to have a child. \n\nWhat you said was cruel and immature and you should apologize. A crying baby is not a sign of an incompetent parent. It\u2019s how babies communicate. You can politely tell your parents that you want to do something else for your break, but there\u2019s no reason to say hurtful things to them.", "NTA.  They\u2019re treating you like a nanny or some sort of vacation help.  That\u2019s weird.  Have fun with your friends.  Little sister will be out of this stage soon, and hopefully, if you want, you can form a relationship with her when she is bigger", "NTA and I'm glad you told them the real reason.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't unpaid childcare.  Your parents need to realize they have two kids and that they should hire baby help.", "NTA. You get to decide how you spend your time.", "No one likes having someone else's responisibility forced on them", "Then you should not come for now, and remind them that you never signed up to be a caretaker for the kid they choose to have.\n\nI also saw in another comment that they are around 50.

I'd say it's a personal fault but your parents ultimately failed.", "\ud83d\ude02 You love making assumptions don't you?\n\nHow was I raised selfish by stating children don't owe their parents ahytbing? That makes zero sense! Especially when parents who expect their kids to owe them something is extremely selfish!.. Do you even understand the definition of it?\n\nFact - children don't owe their parents anything and in my opinion any parent telling their child they owe them something simply because the parent is doing what a parent is supposed to do is an AH.\n\nOh and this post has nothing to do with you either, yet here you are \ud83d\ude09\n\nEdit: I saw your last comment before you blocked me! \n\"Not an assumption if its true.
