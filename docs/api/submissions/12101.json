I suspect they want you to feel responsible for your sister, so in a few years, when you'll have a job, you will take care of her, for example you would take her on trips, buy stuff, contribute to college fund... It looks like they're preparing you to be a replacement parent in a future.", "Nta it's not your place to help with their bad decision", "NTA. I wonder what their expectations were at the age of 18. Even if they really wanted to be so involved with a baby at that age, it doesn't mean that you want that.", "NTA your responsibility is your life and studies at the moment. Not taking care of a child you didn't make. Take care of yourself and future. It is alright to help out once in a while, but it should not be an expected task of you. Go live and do not feel guilty.

With about 18 years in between, the amount of bonding you are going to have is going to be pretty slim as you would be from a totally different generation. Its time you focused on your life and did things a young adult would do than a young single mom. Also at this age the baby wouldn't know or remember who looked after her/ him anyway. Its wise to do as you feel and let your parents deal with the baby until the baby is 2-3 years old when you can have a lot more fun. Also with the college and classes you want home to be a place where you can relax, not do full time mommy shifts tiring you even more. Enjoy your life and let your parents deal with their responsibility if that's how you feel. You don't have to feel bad about anything as you have a life as well.", "NTA, its not your responsibility to help them raise a baby.

I mean first weeks are not easy, but you can't put that burden on your other children.\n\nI just had baby 3, and despite not asking anything to number 1 and 2, they already have to do lots of compromise because yes, a baby cries and it's annoying, they need to refrain from shouting when baby sleeps, I stay home with baby instead of going out with them etc... It's a lot. It seems your parents are not acknowledging this part of their decision, and I can imagine why this is putting you off.\n\nYou could try to explain that to them, and ask them to make time for you, while someone else babysits your sister.", "NTA, but perhaps tell your parents how you truly feel about this, so they can understand.", "NTA. You're an adult and in college. You have plenty on your plate as it is without having to also care for a child that isn't yours.

That's massively selfish of them as you're now a young adult, going to college.\n\nIt sounds like their constant inquiring about if you were coming back was less of an inquiry in their minds, and more telling telling you they want you to come back and \"bond\" and by bond I mean take over their duties because they're tired from the consequences of their own actions.", "NTA - but I think you may have some unresolved issues here regarding your parents having a new baby", "NTA.

I'm asking because that part of this was left out and that's going to make or break my decision about who the asshole is.\n\nIf they have helped you pay for college and they've been supportive of you in getting your education, you're being kind of an asshole for not trying to return the favor in what little ways you can. \n\nIf you paid for college yourself or took out a loan or what not, I would say the parents are in the wrong for expecting you to be their support system on top of you taking out debt or needing to manage your grades to succeed in college.\n\nSo my answer is based on that. \n\nYou didn't mention who is paying so I'm assuming they are.", "They're almost fifty, so not exactly young.

First comment to go into the nuance of the situation. \n\nAlso what\u2019s with this sub and the aversion for kids to help out with siblings? In this case it seems like the kind thing to do, parents are obviously overwhelmed and maybe taking the baby with you to the store can help them? It\u2019s a little like parents are not entitled to any compassion or help from their kids, I don\u2019t get it. If someone I love asks me for help, whatever it is, I\u2019m most likely doing it. In this case I would be helping without them asking.", "Them paying has nothing to do with them wanting a free babysitter for the baby THEY chose to have.", "It's a mix- they are contributing to helping pay for college. The rest is covered by scholarships, my other relatives, and financial aid. I'm also trying to work and find internships so that I can either contribute or create savings.", "Nope!

It's sickening how many people are left to start life in the red. If she doesn't have that burden and is \"annoyed\" by her parents, she shouldn't have accepted the handout.", "Fair enough.\n\nYou're 100% entitled to your time but you also need to communicate that to your parents. If you're trying to work and find internships, that's absolutely valid and you need that experience straight away out of college.\n\nThat said, you also have to recognize they took a hit helping to support you in going to college.\n\nThey didn't need to do that at all. My parents didn't and I had to get by on scholarships and whatever side-money I could get.\n\nThat money could have very well gone toward a babysitter. You get what I'm saying?

Secondly - this is definitely a conversation you need to have with them so that alternate arrangements can be made in that eventuality. Not fair at all to assume that you'd want to be free childcare for their life choices (we all question our life choices from time to time, but adults tend to try to minimise the impact on others). Good luck with academia, good luck with the pickle you seem to be in and hopefully a resolution can be found.", "Again, 100% valid. The burnout is real and everyone in college deals with that.\n\nYou just have to make sure you're communicating this right.

They're both adults and they had one baby already (you). They knew damn well what kind of a responsibility that was going to be. If they couldn't handle that it was a poor choice to make, especially as older parents.\n\nThat said, you also made mistakes I'm sure. They probably still were there by you and did what they could even if you didn't always make the best decision.\n\nThat's all I'm trying to get at. You all obviously love each other and I can guarantee you're going to be a great sister to that baby.

You can do whatever you want on break and if this is how it has been going home I don't really blame you. But babies change a lot very quickly, once she hits 1-2 she's probably going to be adorable and you can really bond with it. Don't cheat yourself out of that experience because you have issues with your parents. You can still have a special bond with it and maybe you'll get to a point where you WANT to be the baby's guardian.", "Nta. This makes sense to me.  I'm too old to have more kids but if I brought a challenging situation into my life I wouldn't make demands on college/post college kids like this:  they need to let you accept your new sibling organically", "YTA, but not for wanting to do something else for spring break. YTA for being immature about the new baby. You\u2019re jealous that the baby has taken your parents attention away from you. You\u2019re afraid that they had another baby because you weren\u2019t enough and now they love you less.

That means they love you and they want to spend time with you. They want you to be a part of your baby sibling\u2019s life. They had such a good experience raising you that they decided to do it again. That baby is going to absolutely **idolize** you. But it\u2019s ok to spend your spring break doing something else. That won\u2019t stop your parents from talking about you constantly to your new sibling as they grow up. That baby is going to love and admire you so much! Even more than they would if you were closer in age. \n\nIf you ever have a baby you are going to be eating your words. You yelled at your parents because the baby is acting like a baby. Babies cry.

Humans are a social species, we are not made to live alone, but to help one another and them us.\n\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get at here is that while you don\u2019t have to help out, you should, to a certain extent. It\u2019s not even about morality or anything, it\u2019s just that if you can help others who you have any sort of close relationship with, you should if it doesn\u2019t impede your life dramatically.\n\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go back home solely to help out however, that is kinda dramatic. It\u2019s just that if you do go home, help out here and there. Nothing major, but if you\u2019re doing nothing, then you may as well. Yes it sucks, but these are your parents and that your sibling. You\u2019re family, you help each other.\n\n\nBesides, most people have kids, and if you\u2019re gonna have kids in the future, it\u2019s only fair you do the same for them that they eventually will do for you as well. familial support (like babysitting, teaching how to take care of infants, et cetera) here and there consistently are such a help in raising small kids. If not, then this is a non-factor.\n\n\nNow you should definitely establish some sort of boundaries however. Don\u2019t cancel any of your plans at home for this, make sure to go out with hometown friends regularly, et cetera. Your parents are wrong for trying to make your support a regular thing; you are a uni student, you are in a very important and busy part of your life. You need to prioritize that. You also need to regularly have downtime and enjoy life.

The best \"archetype\" for your relationship is probably for you to be the \"Fun Aunt.\" When the baby is 8 and you're 26, you'll be the Coolest Damn Person in the World (and you don't specify the baby's gender, but this probably goes double if it's a girl), and when the baby is 14 and you're 32, you'll be the adult who gets the stuff that mom and dad don't understand.\n\nThat's a pretty damn good relationship to have with another human being, on *either* side of it, and your parents shouldn't take that away from either one of you.", "NTA\n\n...however, this is a situation that you want to keep in touch with your parents about.
