I\u2019m training to be a teacher and he\u2019s currently looking for employment, technically I\u2019m working two jobs to support the both of us it\u2019s tiring, but he\u2019s looking so it\u2019s not over that.\n\nThere\u2019s a local burger place I\u2019d been wanting, we rarely go but I\u2019ve been having cravings - they shut at a certain time.\n\nHe agreed to it, he agreed to ordering since they only have one veggie burger I like, it\u2019s not as though there\u2019s multiple things I can have.\n\nThey shut at 9, I got home at 840 and he hadn\u2019t ordered and by the time he went to it was too late, I started crying because I\u2019ve been craving that all week and all I wanted was a burger and a hot shower, I couldn\u2019t even have a shower since he used the last of the hot water.\n\nHe didn\u2019t apologise and offered to go Burger King, which I didn\u2019t want and he got all silent claiming I\u2019m being an AH since he\u2019s been job hunting all day (as I see it my day started at 6am and ended when I got in bed at 930, his day started at 9am and ended at 930, but I\u2019ve got the extra weight of pregnancy) we got into an argument about how we\u2019re comparing days and that he\u2019s overwhelmed.\n\n I asked him to leave, because I don\u2019t like arguing and he had to stay in his car since he moved in with me (away from friends)\n\nHe argued that I\u2019m blowing it out of the window because I\u2019m pregnant and not considering his feelings, because he\u2019s overwhelmed, so am I?  My friends say I\u2019m the AH because he\u2019s probably in over his head, and had to sleep in his car over a burger.\n\nAITA?\n\nI know I said woo to be sarcastic, I\u2019m not excited but I do love the baby already\n\nExcuse my grammar, I\u2019m ok when focusing but honestly not that good with English.\n\nEdit; I can\u2019t respond to everyone, Thankyou for your responses", "created_utc": 1667660064, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymw8r6/aita_for_crying_and_asking_my_boyfriend_to_leave/", "score": 8306, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It'll be easier than supporting him.\n\nHe could go flip burgers if he really wanted to get a job", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not about the burger\u2026it\u2019s about the lack of respect he demonstrated towards you. \n\nYou are working two jobs and supporting everything, while pregnant, and he can\u2019t even do something that he said that he would do. Because he\u2019s \u2018overwhelmed\u2019 by job hunting. That\u2019s a BS answer. \n\nHe\u2019s nothing more than a inconsiderate, lazy leech at this point and is causing you more stress and work than help.", "Your boyfriend is essentially living off of his almost due girlfriend and can't take 5 minutes to do something for the one paying for his home? You're NTA, but unfortunately you're already dealing with a child even before you've finished pregnancy", "NTA. Forget the burger (sort of) here\u2019s where I say kick him out:\n\nHe knows you get home about 840 after a twelve hour day working two jobs, and like to take a hot shower to decompress.   He\u2019s sitting around all day, and takes a long enough shower right before you get home to use up all the hot water.  That\u2019s a total asshole move.", "NTA. You\u2019re pregnant, exhausted, and overwhelmed. You deserve the damn burger.\n\nSounds like my dude needs a job *while* he\u2019s job hunting. Anything, pick up some shifts and Target or Chipotle. It\u2019s next to impossible NOT to find a retail or service job right now they are desperate. I know he is probably looking for something long term (and that\u2019s fine to do as long as he has SOMETHING for the moment) but he needs to lock down some income STAT bc you can\u2019t go on like this.", "NTA and give yourself some grace.  You didn\u2019t kick him out because of the burger.  The burger was the final straw I what sounds like a series of stressors.", "Nta. He brings nothing to the table. Being a single mom would be less work than raising a baby and a almost 30year old man.", "From my perspective you didn't cry over a burger... you cried because he just doesn't care.\n\nSo you're pregnant, working 2 jobs and have a craving.\nHe's at home \"searching for a job all day\" and can't even go out to buy a burger? And he even takes a hot shower, and now you can't because you're out of hot water? \n\nSo he didn't even think that maybe his pregnant girlfriend working 2 jobs need hot water in the end of the day.\n\nYou're not TA. He is... a big one", "NTA. it's not really about the burger.  It's that he said he would take care of something he knew was important to you, then dropped the ball, then told you you weren't allowed to be upset about it.  And to top it off, he then tries to turn it around on you because he's overwhelmed by being home all day looking for employment while you work two jobs at 6 months pregnant to support him. Eesh.", "NTA. I have a hard time believing he was job hunting for 12 and a half hours straight. He had plenty of time to get you a burger.", "NTA\n\nGirl. This is going to be your life soon. Why are you bringing this man into the fold? What is he really doing for you?\n\nHe\u2019s 28 without a job and you\u2019ve got a baby coming in 2-3 months\u2026 obviously this one situation is likely a hormone response but it isn\u2019t going to get better if he isn\u2019t contributing to your life.", "OP, you were only dating for five months when you became pregnant.\n\nYou\u2019ve been pregnant in this relationship longer than not pregnant.\n\nHow quickly did he move in? How long has he been without a job? And how was moving in with you while you were pregnant helping you?\n\nBecause all these things combined make him sound like a man in his late twenties who intentionally latched on to you so he wouldn\u2019t have to take care of himself.", "NTA. Maybe he should go stay with his \u201cfriend\u201d with all the toxic relationship advice. Even if you weren\u2019t pregnant you didn\u2019t over react to kick out a deadbeat who can\u2019t do the ONE thing you asked. He is absolutely not looking for a job for 12 hours. Also a baby doesn\u2019t care about what job you have. That\u2019s crap. He\u2019s using you and will not lift a finger once that baby comes.", "Btw he can get a job while job hunting. I did freelance work while job hunting. Other friends of mine got retail or server jobs while they were job hunting.  The idea that you would spend all day \u201cjob hunting\u201d while your pregnant girlfriend works 2 jobs is frankly despicable.", "When you said that you got pregnant and he moved in, I assumed that that was to help you and kiddle  to start a family. Apparently not the case at all. \n\nI'm going to be very harsh here. He has to stop talking about finding a job and find a goddamn job. You have to stop working two jobs to help support him. Your job is to support that baby not him. Actually that's his job as well.\n\nYou may notice I have not discussed the burger and that's because it's irrelevant.\n\nYou are NTA but you need to take several steps back and evaluate your options.", "What was he overwhelmed by? Job applications? I realize job hunting is more work than one would think but you had literally been working all day and his had promised to get the burgers. He\u2019s a grown up and should know how to plan his time so that he can make the order before the restaurant closes. It\u2019s not that hard. He needs to step up. NTA.", "NTA. I have to say this; I think the fact you are pregnant, with maybe a less than easy pregnancy( if I am reading right) You are working 2 jobs. Your BF is unemployed. I am seriously wondering if the crying was all about the burger?", "NTA. He is though.  He could have taken 5mins any time of that day to take care of the order, but chose to not do so. \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, my now husband (then boyfriend of a few months) went out the next day and got a job at McDonald\u2019s, before that he was looking for a job he wanted. After hearing a kid was coming, went for any job that would hire him. And I\u2019ve always been thankful for that kind of mind set.", "Oh look,another girl stuck with a much older, completely useless guy who no girl his own age would tolerate.\n\nSo, same advice as every other time we have this exact same scenario: walk away, a life as a single mother of 1 is way better than the life of a single mother of 2 children (one being nearly 30).\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nLook, I\u2019ve been unemployed several times.  Even with retyping my entire resume into the application after attaching it to the app and then doing that over and over the daily job search takes about 5 hours.\n\nYes, you\u2019re hormonal.  You\u2019re having a difficult pregnancy.  He can at least be aware of your basic needs. Like not using all of the hot water right before you get home.", "i hope he moved in with you because he loves you and wants to start a family with you not just because he got you pregnant and feels forced. he doesn\u2019t sound like a good partner, he is lazy and doesn\u2019t care about your needs. you deserve the world for working 2 job being pregnant and he can\u2019t even get you a burger ??", "NTA\n\nmy 2nd pregnancy i literally sat in the middle of isle where pickles are and cry cos all kosher dill pickles were sold out. that was literally the only thing ive been craving throughout my pregnancy. luckily my husband managed to dig into shelves to find 1 jar of pickles hidden from people lol. my sad tears had turned into happy ones and everyone was staring at me awkwardly \n\ni mean...fat pregnant lady sitting down on isle crying for pickles and cant even manage to get up from where she sat....i do agree it was funny but devastating at that moment lol \n\nfor your case, yes it escalated quickly and yes it could have been next dayd problem but pregnancy brain sometime be dramatic", "NTA. Break up now. You\u2019ll be better off raising that baby alone than with someone who acts like this.", "I would\u2019ve order it at like 7 and had the oven pre heated to warm up your burger when you got home. The bar is set SO SO LOW for soooo many men and yet they STILL manage to trip over it. Dude needs to apologize, you weren\u2019t asking for that much. NTA especially for him calling YOU an asshole for being emotional. Not only are you pregnant, but you\u2019re working two jobs. All you wanted was a night with your preferred entr\u00e9e and a hot shower. Those are by no means Big asks", "NTA. I find it VERY hard to believe that he is legitimately job hunting for over 12 hours every single day. You\u2019re pregnant, working two jobs and supporting him and he couldn\u2019t take 10 mins out of his oh-so-busy day to do one thing for you? \n\nNahhh, there\u2019s something fishy with that. You might as well start getting used to the idea of being solely responsible for your baby, because if he is this selfish and inconsiderate before baby gets here, he won\u2019t get any better after.", "NTA. Honestly, if he's this little help while you're pregnant, imagine how much worse it's going to get when you finally have the baby. This is passive aggressive nastiness that he's pulling.", "This guy might be your baby\u2019s daddy but he\u2019s not your partner. He\u2019s telling you loud and clear that he doesn\u2019t have your back. Please believe him. This will be how he operates when the pregnancy gets closer to your due date.\n\nWith that knowledge, it\u2019s up to you to work out how many kids you want to take care off. You currently have 1 with number 2 coming soon. How much do you want to suffer just to be able to say the father of your baby lives with you.\n\nDo the right for yourself and your soon to be child. Choose your own happiness not what society or family think. You don\u2019t need to live with the baby\u2019s father.", "NTA. If done daily, job hunting isn\u2019t that hard. The first day took me an hour tops to scan through jobs that met my standards and then 10 minutes each day after. What\u2019s he actually doing?", "NTA believe me he could be working in fast food or something else that isn\u2019t glamorous or comfy. Why is he happy to \u201clook\u201d for employment while his pregnant partner works 2 jobs??????\n\nDidn\u2019t get his pregnant partner food \n\nKnew you worked all day while he didn\u2019t and still used the last of the hot water\n\nThis man will not improve. Plan to do this alone and the moment he is employed get child support.", "NTA You have an uphill battle ahead of you. understand right now you have two children. That man is way too old to be with you, got you pregnant probably so you won\u2019t leave him \n\n(which is rude! Men leave their DNA with women to hold them back keep them around, or bring them down to their level by giving that woman his offspring)\n\n And has the nerve to be unemployed so he can\u2019t even afford what he\u2019s done.", "NTA\nYou're pregnant AND working two jobs?!\nAnd all you wanted him to do after he had a long hard day of job searching, and your long day which started at 6AM was order you a burger you've been craving and he couldn't even do that...I would've lost my ever loving mind and he would've been on the streets so fast.", "NTA. He was \"job hunting\" until 8:40 PM? Not likely. You are working two jobs and he isn't working and he couldn't be bothered to call in an order. And he didn't apologize for his screw up.", "NTA it sounds like you are cracking under all the weight of doing everything. You\u2019re working two job to support the both of you, which will include the baby soon. Your BF can\u2019t be bothered to leave hot water for you or order a burger from a place you can tolerate. He wasn\u2019t job hunting for 12 hours. If he really was job hunting 12 hours a day every day for 6 months, he would have a job by now. \n\nHow are you going to manage when the baby comes? I don\u2019t see how your boyfriend becomes a team player in 3 months.", "NTA. It\u2019s not really about the burger and I\u2019m sorry your friends can\u2019t see that. It\u2019s about you being unable to rely on him, and him being unable to make anyone\u2019s needs (other than his own) important. \n\nBeyond that, it\u2019s also about him being unable to accept accountability for his actions and the effect they had on someone else. To me, this part is the bigger deal. \n\nHow different would the situation have been if he had said \u201coh my god, I\u2019m SO sorry babe, I completely lost track of time. I\u2019ll go to the grocery store and get whatever and make it\u201d or something like that? *Anything* where he\u2019s apologizing for the mistake and actively attempting to resolve the problem HE created.", "Man my ex-bf was an ass but you know what when I was pregnant he made sure I had what I wanted!", "NTA. Please don\u2019t listen to anyone saying that making him leave was an overreaction. This guy brings absolutely nothing to the table. If anything he adds to your stress and burdens. He\u2019s an inconsiderate moocher, and it will be worse after the baby comes. You said food and saving hot water are little things. Yes they are in a sense, but also no they\u2019re not when you come home after a long, hard day. My husband and I have been together almost 24 years and we will take shorter showers or even cold showers so that the other can have a hot one. If we know the other is tired or had an exhausting day, we do little things to make the day easier or more pleasant for the other. Little things make a huge difference. You deserve someone like that. This guy is not it!", "This is why a guy who is pushing 30 is dating someone who's barely out of her teens. I'm sorry :(", "NTA. As someone who had had a horrible pregnancy myself, I understand how tiring that can be. Add on top of it working two jobs while he job hunts(which can be stressful on its own) but the small things adding up that you mentioned in a comment lead me to think that he is pretty careless/thoughtless about being attentive to your needs. So what\u2019s he going to drop the ball on with the baby? Forgetting to change the diaper, or buying diapers, formula, etc? He could\u2019ve got you your burger; he chose not to. Saving hot water for you? He\u2019s home more than you he could\u2019ve chose to shower at a different time so you\u2019d have that luxury. Asking him to leave did not have to mean sleeping in his car but leaving for a couple hours for the situation to cool down or I don\u2019t know apologizing and making it up to you?", "NTA\u2014 he was look for jobs until 9pm? HAH. No. He made a promise and broke it because it didn\u2019t matter to *him*. It\u2019s \u201csmall\u201d but it shows how he feels about you. You are a bank and a place to live.", "NTA. Hugs for you. Dump the friends who're calling you AH. They're not your friends.", "NTA. You are carrying the entire load for your family. Does he actually contribute anything? Applying for jobs does not take that much time or effort, and if he was putting in time or effort, he would already have a job. He couldn\u2019t even be bothered to get you a burger. You and your baby deserve better.", "I cried over everything when pregnant, I have all the extreme feelings showing that I usually manage when not pregnant. I sympathize with cravings so much! Sometimes you just want one specific thing, and he agreed to do it. And then didn't. NTA for you. \n\n\nBUT... is he really looking for a job? Any job? Or does he only want one specific job which he may or may not get? Does he do the house/apartment stuff since you're pregnant AND working? What does he think things will look like with a baby in the picture?", "Where is he job hunting? Maybe you aren\u2019t in the US, but no one lets you just walk in and ask for a job. Everything is done online now. If he\u2019s not doing interviews, after applying online, then he\u2019s just out screwing off. He sounds pretty useless. You\u2019ll be better off without him. You\u2019re an adult. Screw what your parents think.", "NTA. He sounds like a complete dick and you have hormones raging that you can\u2019t control. You are 100% working harder than him. Job hunting is exhausting but he had time to get you a burger you really wanted. Growing a human is one of the hardest things one can do. You deserve that burger. And you deserve hot water and not not loser griping instead of going out of the way for you", "NTA. This guy has no job, and can\u2019t even help take care of your basic needs? Kick him out, you don\u2019t need him.", "NTA, and really, I don\u2019t think this is about the burger. I once broke up with a boyfriend because he wouldn\u2019t go to a yoga class. It wasn\u2019t really about the yoga class, it was just the last straw of broken promises. He\u2019s not helping you with this pregnancy, why does he need to stay with you?", "Info - is this the first time he's let you down like this?", "NTA. But do yourself a HUGE favor and kick him out. You are already going to be fully supporting your baby and yourself you don't need to support him too. He is not looking for a job, if he was truly looking to step up and help he would take any job and keep looking for something better. Don't let him suck you in.", "NTA. But you are being played. He wasn\u2019t exhausted from job hunting all day. I would be surprised if he is actually looking at all. Tell him you have proven you can do this without him, so he has 1 month to show what he brings to the table or he can \u201csupport\u201d you through child support and every other weekend visitation.", "It sounds like this isn't about the burger so much as not getting the support you need from your partner. If you're working two jobs and he's job hunting, he should be doing more to support you. The idea that he's exhausted is a cop out when you are clearly doing more than he is, both in terms of physical work, finances, and likely household responsibilities, since he can't even manage to get food. \n\nNTA, and be aware that this approach to things is likely going to continue once the baby comes, unless something drastic changes.", "NTA. Sounds like he\u2019s being picky about what kind of job he wants (because literally everywhere is hiring especially fast food) OR he only pretends to be job hunting for 12 hours a day. I mean, with 12 hours, I could probably apply to hundreds of jobs. It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m qualified to work those jobs but at least he\u2019d be trying. \n\nIn all this time he has been \u201cjob hunting\u201d how many interviews has he had? It sounds like he\u2019d rather free load off of you than actually go and get a job. He\u2019s gonna have a rude awakening when this baby comes and he has to help out.", "NTA. The credential program to become a teacher was one of the most stressful and overwhelming times of my life. I can\u2019t even imagine doing it while pregnant and financially supporting two people. I barely got through the training and I was still living at home with my parents.", "NTA. Kick him out. You don\u2019t need a second child to solo parent.", "At this point it\u2019s not even just about the burger, it just seems like he\u2019s kind of a bum in general and uses excuses to justify why he\u2019s so stagnant. Sounds like dead weight me. NTA", "NTA. It isn't about the burger. It is about the fact that you are pregnant while working two jobs to support his unemployed self and he couldn't even do the one thing you asked him to do. And he used all the hot water. I would have been mad too. He isn't taking care of you while you are taking care of everything.", "NTA. Your life right now sounds exhausting. Honestly I don't think this was solely about the burger. You have a lot of stress, and he's not doing enough to reduce it. One thing that is noticeable is that you are working to support the living expenses of two adults and soon two adults plus a baby. It probably would be easier on you if he lived somewhere else. Him stressing you out in your own space, plus adding to your expenses, isn't working out. It would make sense if his presence reduced your stress (massages, moral support, preparing meals, etc) and cut your expenses (splitting bills), but that's not how it worked out. This doesn't necessarily have to mean a breakup. People have relationships all the time while living separately. But right now this seems best for both you and the baby. I hope there are other people in your life you can count on, because it doesn't sound like he is reliable or holds himself accountable for doing better.", "NTA. Red flag that he\u2019s acting like his day is even in the ballpark of how rough yours is. He doesn\u2019t even *have* a job, and you have two! Plus you\u2019re pregnant. Physically, it\u2019s pretty easy to not have two jobs and not be pregnant. Can\u2019t believe he is arguing with you about that.", "You threw your freeloading boyfriend out because he couldn\u2019t get you something to eat? He\u2019s unemployed what was he doing that was so urgent? NTA", "Nta and I'd be making him go to a temp agency or staffing agency. he needs a job yesterday. If your stressed now your really gonna be stressed with no income", "NTA - do better for you and your future baby. He has a child on the way and is content just \u201clooking\u201d for a job. If he really wanted one, he\u2019d take one that is less appealing like fast food or retail. He doesn\u2019t care because you\u2019re happy to support him. You deserve better.", "INFO: What does he bring to this partnership? Other than sperm?", "Older man knocks up someone who\u2019s barely experienced adulthood, immediately moves in with her while she works 2 jobs to support him. \n\nSounds like he hit the lottery and you\u2019re being ridiculously taken advantage of. You\u2019re only 21. Do you really want to be supporting a grown man? This situation WILL NOT CHANGE unless you change it. \n\nDo it now.", "NTA this is a mess. You have a bf you don\u2019t know very well and you\u2019re bringing a baby into this world. He does nothing, has no job and doesn\u2019t even respect you. And when the baby comes it will be even worse. Makes sense that he cannot find someone his age because he\u2019s a freeloading loser dating someone of college aged. You\u2019re tired, overwhelmed and not super excited about being pregnant in a new relationship. I don\u2019t see this ending well frankly and you should prepare to do this yourself and give him the boot. Because if it\u2019s between doing this alone and not supporting your bf or doing this alone and having a freeloader I would choose the former", "NTA\u2014But how hard is he looking for a job? Do you believe he\u2019s actually out looking for a job at 9pm? He can\u2019t get hired at a grocery store stocking shelves? What about as a janitor somewhere? You\u2019re six months pregnant and working 2 jobs, and he has no job. How long has he been unemployed?", "First off, you\u2019re allowed to have complicated feelings about being pregnant at any point in time and especially when you\u2019re 21, still in school and getting no assistance from your partner.  It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love or want your baby, it just means that things are rarely black and white and this is no exception.\n\nNTA but honestly, maybe it\u2019s time to consider getting some space from him for longer than a night.  He\u2019s had 6 months to show you that he\u2019s a partner capable of pulling his weight and that\u2019s not happening.  If it means that he has to move back home for a while to get his shit together then maybe he has to do that but this current situation where you\u2019re doing everything while being pregnant and he\u2019s whining about the great stress that is filling out some job applications is unsustainable and will breed resentment.", "NTA he sounds inconsiderate. Also he got you pregnant, moved in with you and doesn\u2019t have a job? And he\u2019s 7 years older than you? \n\nAlso he has no job why couldn\u2019t he get your burger? What job was he looking for at 8PM? And he used up the hot water??? Girl\n\nHe sounds like that TLC song", "NTA. Girl you sound exhausted. I get that your friends think it's 'over a burger' but you're working a 65 hour week, dealing with a complicated pregnancy, with a selfish hot-water using, freeloading, unapologetic boyfriend who seems to think job-hunting qualifies as a job? \n\nI'm glad he had to sleep in his car for a night, it should be a reminder of what his life would be without all that you do for him. He needs to grow up, and in the next 3 months. For the sake of your future child, I suggest you have a serious conversation with him about what he intends on bringing to the table because he is not remotely pulling his weight.", "NTA.  No one job hunts for a solid 12 hours.  He should have said he forgot, and offer a groveling apology.", "NTA, but none of this is good. You all have a little person coming soon who is going to be dependent on both of you for everything. Just because talking about his job hunting may stress him out, he still needs to communicate what exactly he's doing to find a job. I know it largely depends on where you are, but the place where my daughter is working is so desperate they just hired two 14 year olds. He needs a job that pays, even if it's something in retail or whatever. You've got far more going on than a burger and a shower. You are so much younger than him, but it sounds like you're motivated and doing well. Him, not so much.", "NTA.  its about more than the burger.  Youre pregnant with his child working 2 jobs to support his ass as well and hes soooo overwhelmed by \"job hunting\" that he couldn't do the bare minimum of calling in take out for you.  He can stay in his car. He's doing NOTHING for you.  Jobs aren't that hard to come by he could be working anywhere to bring in something to help out.  But he won't because he's taking advantage of you WHILE YOURE PREGNANT.  And your friends are trash for saying your being too harsh, they should be helping you pack his things", "Hunny, from what we can see, when you give birth your gonna be taking care of two children. He wasn't considerate enough to make sure there was time to get the food, he used all of the hot water with no consideration for you, and he doesn't have a job? \n\nOn top of that, he started gaslighting you before the fight even started. You didn't just kick him out over a burger, it's obvious there's more at play here, and him gaslighting you isn't a good look. NTA, and please take a step back and reevaluate if this relationship is healthy for either of you.", "Definitely NTA.  He is though. And he's probably lying about the job search.\n\nIt took me about 45 minutes to get my resume looking spiffy.\nIt then took me about another 20 or so to get it uploaded onto indeed and market it to the line of work I'm interested in.\n\nLet's assume your 28 year old boyfriend doesn't want to make a resume and wants to apply for every job online with their application.\n\nOkay.  So each employer asks the same general info.  Name, address, history, skills, education, references.  After a few of these, the info become easier to put in.\n\nSo let's also assume he doesn't remember everything and has to think about each question separately.   \n\nLet's be super generous and say he can successfully complete one entire online application per HOUR.\n\nHe's awake from what, you said 9am-9pm?  That's 12 hours.  Let's be nice and say he stops when you get home, around 630.  That's still 9.5 hours (we'll round him down to 9 in case he really needs to focus).\n\nThat's 9 applications.  Per day.  Every day.  In one work week (we'll give him weekends off because job hunting and inputting the same info 9 times a day can get tedious), that's 45 applications.   You say he hasn't been there long so let's assume one month, so 4 weeks.  45 applications a week for 4 weeks is 180 applications.  Per. Month.  \n\nSo unless your guy has absolutely zero skills or terrible references and a sketchy job history, my guess is he is absolutely lying to you while also enjoying the mooching process.   Sure maybe he put in an app here or there, but he's probably doing whatever hobbies he enjoys (gaming/reading/tv binge/whatever).  \n\nKick him out or give him a hard deadline and if he doesn't meet it, out he goes.  You didn't mention being pregnant with twins so I don't understand why you'd be willing to take care of two children.", "NTA. Kicking him out was over more than just the burger. It was over him being a leech while you bust your pregnant butt. Is he actually looking for work? Have you seen applications, him going to interviews and him taking phone calls? Because in 6 months you\u2019d think he would have found something-even part time minimum wage something just to get some more cash coming in. I\u2019d be really suspicious of whether or not he actually spends his days \u201clooking\u201d for work. Then for him to be so inconsiderate. You asked him for one thing. Just one and he couldn\u2019t manage that. I\u2019d strongly reconsider this relationship. He doesn\u2019t seem helpful, supportive, responsible, etc. which isn\u2019t the type of person I\u2019d want to coparent a child with.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is absolutely taking advantage of you when you are most vulnerable. Jobs are still pretty plentiful right now, if he wants to work, he\u2019ll find a job, even if it\u2019s not ideal, just to bring in cash for the family. How is he benefiting your life at all? He\u2019s wasting all your resources for what? He can\u2019t even do less than the bare minimum and shower earlier in the day so that you get a hot shower. That was calculated, he\u2019s keeping you uncomfortable, mentally exhausted, physically exhausted, and when he should be doing something to help, he just makes it worse AND then let\u2019s you doubt yourself and think you\u2019re crazy. He\u2019s not being a good partner or friend right now. Get out while the getting is good.", "NTA\n\nHe is either bringing something to the table making your life much better or he isn't.

Even if you weren\u2019t pregnant. You are supporting him and all you asked for was a burger. I bet if he\u2019d have said no when you asked him to get it, you\u2019d have made arrangements to get it yourself. He let you down. He made a promise he didn\u2019t keep and is mad at you for it.", "INFO: What does he bring to the relationship?", "NTA. You got knocked up by a hobosexual. I wouldn\u2019t let him back until he\u2019s held a job down for a couple months and can prove he can be an actual contributor", "NTA. He is an inconsiderate SOB. It is probably not going to improve once the child is here, and you are probably going to end the relationship anyway.", "Are you sure he's looking for work ? I mean from reading that I wouldn't put it pass him to just be lying", "NTA, but your boyfriend is giving hobosexual. You can do bad by yourself sis.", "Where is he job hunting after 8 p.m.? \n\nYou are working 2 jobs and pregnant, and he didn't prioritize this one thing you asked of him. I am sure he's frustrated with the situation  as well, but I think you're NTA for needing a little space under the circumstances.", "NTA.... he had one job.... order you some food.... apparently he can't do that though", "NTA. Man was job hunting on either a phone or computer right???? So why couldn\u2019t he just place the order? He is a mooch and a weirdo and your friends fucking suck for trying to defend this. Dump the lot of em", "Info: how long has he been out of work?", "NTA \u2026 While job hunting does suck there\u2019s no way he sat there for 12.5 hours looking for jobs. He could have woken up earlier. I use sticky notes or an alarm on my phone to set reminders for simple things cause I know I\u2019ll forget. If he was tired from the search (it can be daunting) he could\u2019ve taken a break. I.E. walked to get some fresh air (or driven cause that helps clear the mind too), grabbed the burger, and some food for hisself. I don\u2019t think he should necessarily grovel, but it\u2019s so simple to own up to a mistake and think of a way to resolve the issue. (No Burger King doesn\u2019t count as a solution since it\u2019s nasty as f*ck).", "NTA. He dare to compare his situation to yours?! He is a childish AH, who doesn't respect you at all. A lazy guy, what a big deal about ordering, he doesn't even work...And he used all of the hot water...selfish boy, not a real man.", "NTA do n9t let him come back. He isnt job seeking all day or he would have a job, he is using you.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to be pissed. You trusted him to do something for you and he didn't and then flipped it on you. This is only going to get harder when you have a baby. What was the reason he gave for not doing it? If you didn't have to support both of you, would it be less of a burden to get through your day?", "NTA but you gotta get out of this. You will find someone that treats you like gold. Right now, you aren\u2019t being treated like gold. He is making your struggle worse and then some. Let him have the apartment and move in with family if that\u2019s an option. You can\u2019t do it all alone. You and your bun in the oven need someone supportive and caring.", ">My friends say I\u2019m the AH because he\u2019s probably in over his head\n\nWith not working while having his life paid for by his 6 months pregnant, 7 years younger girlfriend? Yeah must be tough.

He\u2019s being extremely picky and he\u2019s letting you carry ALL the load.", "NTA. Not only are you supporting the household and growing a person, but (having been pregnant myself) there are few things so certain to make a pregnant person cry than having major disappointment around cravings and needing to rest.

I spent an hour everyday before work applying for jobs. Landed the perfect onein 6 weeks. With platforms like indeed it is very easy to apply for jobs. He needs to be an adult and take any job he can so that you are not working two  jobs.", "The fact that I'm seeing even one YTA is bizarre. People need to understand this is not about a burger anymore. This is about her freeloading \"boyfriend\" getting upset that she didn't want burger king.", "NTA \n\nI don't believe he's looking for work after 6:00pm.    What was he doing in the evening when you weren't there?  \n\nI understand he's stressed.   But he has no idea what it's like carrying a baby *and* working two jobs.     You're really doing three jobs.   Making a baby is exhausting in and of itself.   \n\nYou asked for your dinner to be picked up at a desired place and he failed.   He also had to shower in the evening?      \n\nYou're both stressed but you're the one who takes priority because you are working the two jobs and pregnant.", "NTA. He is bringing nothing to the table, quite the contrary, so you have every right to loose the dead weight. As if you didn\u2019t already have enough with two jobs and a pregnancy. Does he even do chores around the house? Why has he not taken a cashier or waiter job in the meantime? Do you get anything out of him living with you?\nEdit: misspelling", "NTA but girl, consider losing the boyfriend", "NTA    his excuse is lame. Every industry is looking for employees right now, he's not in a position to look for his dream job, he needs to get a job yesterday. \n\nThe burger was a tipping point, he is inconsiderate about your needs, and needs to step up. You are having a difficult pregnancy, he should be working 2 jobs, not you.\n\nConsider dumping his ass, and save money for childcare, if job hunting is stressful, imagine how much harder it is to care for a baby.", "NTA, so is he tired from looking on his phone for employment job sites?", "NTA. For all the reasons pointed out by others. Pregnancy is really tiring not just about the fact that your body is creating a little one, and the physical constraint on your body, but also the difficulty sleeping at night. As many as pointed out, it is not just about the burger but what it represents. Should you have sent him to sleep a car maybe not, unless you don't have a sofa. You really need to speak with your boyfriend about what will happen once baby is here. Is he going to be a stay at home dad, so you can go back to work (pending on potential job, this may work better budget wise)? Are you taking maternity leave and how long, how much this will impact your budget if he doesn't work? If you both work (if he find a job), who will look after the baby? ... Those are questions you really need to try to answer with your boyfriend if you haven't have. Remember once baby is here, you are both going to suffer from lack of sleep (I found with me that it hit me about 2 weeks after) and it will put a lot of pressure on the relationship. Life will be what it will be and you can't plan for everything but it may help.", "your boyfriend sounds like my dad like 5 years ago. he would \"job hunt\" for 8 hours a day. like sir. it does not take 8 hours to apply to literally any full time job, you have been unemployed for 6 months, then 12 months, then 18 MONTHS. Turns out, he was just watching soccer games and being a lazy and prideful baby while my mom, sister, and I were all working. \n\nIf you are personalizing a CV and resume for every single job no matter how similar the jobs are to each other, you are never going to find work. A million and one jobs are available. It doesn't have to be a career, he has all the time after your baby is born and he is gainfully employed and supporting your family to find that, but he does need full time work as of like *checks calendar* 6 months ago. \n\nSounds like he's saddling you with all the responsibilities and can't even get off his ass long enough to get you a hamburger when he's literally at home 12 hours a day. You better be rethinking being so lax with him not being employed yet, because you are pregnant, working 2 jobs, and completing your education, and he couldn't get your food in 12 whole hours of a day and he even didn't leave you hot water to shower. Inconsiderate and lazy and a bad partner. NTA, but you would be if you let yourself be disrespected like this forever and with it force your baby to live in this unhappy home with a dad who doesn't care about mom.", "I can\u2019t believe he can\u2019t find a job. He should take any job and then look for a better job.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s a parasite\n\nYou and your baby would be better off without him, he\u2019s bringing nothing to your life", "NTA. I\u2019m a stay at home wife and currently pregnant with my first. My husband will get off an 8 hour shift and go get my anything I want if I ask him to. Your boyfriend isn\u2019t going to miss out on a job opportunity by taking 30 mins to go get your burger.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry to say but from this I would say you need to lose him now. Job hunting is hard but not hard enough to be that exhausted and dickish. You\u2019re 6 months along and he can\u2019t figure something out by now? Honestly you might wanna think of the possibility he isn\u2019t job hunting and rather is going out with someone.", "NTA for being upset, although asking him to leave and letting him sleep in his car was a bit extreme. I do worry about what's going to happen when the baby arrives. If he can't handle ordering you a burger in time, will he be reliable when it comes to taking care of the baby? Perhaps this is an opportunity to have some honest conversations about expectations about partnership and parenting.", "NTA\n\nYou and your bf are going to be parents soon. Keeping your word about something is going to become more critical soon. If you say you will do something do it. \n\nThis isn't about a burger.

Your working 2 jobs while being pregnant to cover all the household financial obligations of 2 adults. \n\nUnless there is some major circumstances you left out of the post your bf needs to look outside of his preferred employment choice and just become employed.

Pick your favorite place. He's not looking, he's saying he is and he's dragging his feet.\n\nDude is mooching off you and he will continue to. If you call him out on it, he'll give you some cock and bull story about how getting hired is \"so hard\" and he's \"trying\" and that is emotional manipulation. \n\nYou already shown that you can do this solo, and it's not gonna get easier once the baby is here. If anything it will be more excuses about how he can't work, then youre footing the bill for 3 people permanently.

Being pregnant and deal with cravings and hormones sucks! Was acting very inconsiderate and didn\u2019t realize how much it would mean to you. Maybe a little overboard kicking him out of this house too and making him sleep in his car, when you could if went to separate rooms or whatever for the night. But try and have a conversation with him about it. It\u2019s not just the burger, it\u2019s him being inconsiderate of your feelings, working two jobs while growing a human inside of you. You\u2019re not asking for the world, just a little consideration and a burger. Good luck!", "NTA ofc.\n\nAs others have pointed out, why living with this deadweight? He should be supporting you in your condition, not the opposite.\n\nYou're the one working and he dares comparing your days?

I\u2019m training to be a teacher and he\u2019s currently looking for employment, technically I\u2019m working two jobs to support the both of us it\u2019s tiring, but he\u2019s looking so it\u2019s not over that.\n\nThere\u2019s a local burger place I\u2019d been wanting, we rarely go but I\u2019ve been having cravings - they shut at a certain time.\n\nHe agreed to it, he agreed to ordering since they only have one veggie burger I like, it\u2019s not as though there\u2019s multiple things I can have.\n\nThey shut at 9, I got home at 840 and he hadn\u2019t ordered and by the time he went to it was too late, I started crying because I\u2019ve been craving that all week and all I wanted was a burger and a hot shower, I couldn\u2019t even have a shower since he used the last of the hot water.\n\nHe didn\u2019t apologise and offered to go Burger King, which I didn\u2019t want and he got all silent claiming I\u2019m being an AH since he\u2019s been job hunting all day (as I see it my day started at 6am and ended when I got in bed at 930, his day started at 9am and ended at 930, but I\u2019ve got the extra weight of pregnancy) we got into an argument about how we\u2019re comparing days and that he\u2019s overwhelmed.\n\n I asked him to leave, because I don\u2019t like arguing and he had to stay in his car since he moved in with me (away from friends)\n\nHe argued that I\u2019m blowing it out of the window because I\u2019m pregnant and not considering his feelings, because he\u2019s overwhelmed, so am I?  My friends say I\u2019m the AH because he\u2019s probably in over his head, and had to sleep in his car over a burger.\n\nAITA?\n\nI know I said woo to be sarcastic, I\u2019m not excited but I do love the baby already\n\nExcuse my grammar, I\u2019m ok when focusing but honestly not that good with English.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Don\u2019t walk run from that relationship he sounds like a hobo sexual. He doesn\u2019t want a job  he wants a mommy to bottle feed him and work for him. If he refused to get a job that you said was handed to him because he claimed his friend told him not to and won\u2019t do chores without a list you need to get out of that and never look back. Your kid will not be cared for by him and if he wants to be a SAHD your child\u2019s life is in danger due to him being negligent", "NTA. \n\nHe applied to how many jobs? And spent how long doing whatever else he did?\n\nOP - don\u2019t invite him back. Not until he has a job and is ready to treat you like an equal.", "NTA, how does a 28 y/o man have nothing to his name, get a young 21 y/o pregnant, then complain because he\u2019s tired from sitting doing essentially nothing all day? he\u2019s 28, if he can even consider a family he should have a house. sorry if it\u2019s harsh but that\u2019s a child you\u2019re dating, a mental child", "NTA Your cocklodger babytrapped you, & was probably showering away the evidence smells. Bar? Affair? \n\nThis isnt going to get any better, he's just waiting on that baby to be his reason not to work", "ETA\nHe is definitely the AH for not being able to even place an order with his \"job hunting\", and not being able to at least work fast food to make some kind of money until he finds something better!\n\nYou a AH because this is a horrible situation to have put yourself into and should not be having his baby and run from him long ago.", "NTA. Honey. You are doing EVERYTHING. All you asked him to do was get you food before 9pm, and he didn\u2019t do it. \n\n\nMeanwhile YOU are working two jobs while 6 months pregnant and he\u2019s sitting at home all day. Yes yes, looking for jobs. I\u2019ve been there. But he really couldn\u2019t be bothered to get you the one thing you asked for? He uses all your resources. Free place, free food and all your hot water\u2026 AND he\u2019s ungrateful and unhelpful?\n\nThink about what he\u2019s gonna be like when the baby is born. He says he\u2019s tired from job hunting when you\u2019ve been up since 6 and working two jobs all day? What\u2019s he gonna say when you\u2019re working and you ask him to take care of baby at night? That he\u2019s tired from his job? What about you? \n\nHe\u2019s a grown ass man without his shit together and a baby on the way. He could be at least working somewhere temporary while looking for a more permanent job on the side. He contributes nothing to your household and not really to you.", "NTA for crying and being mad about it ~~but I think YTA for making him sleep in the car over a burger~~.  That seems like an overreaction.  You're probably actually mad at him for not having a job, which is fair.  I'm guessing he's not looking as hard as he could be.\n\n/u/simulet changed my mind.  Just NTA.  He's out of line calling you an AH.", "This guy is a jerk, not arguing that fact. BuTTtt..this is also a good opportunity for me to remind everyone that a lot of fights can happen because your partner isn\u2019t a mind reader. OP told us, the readers, that this burger was all she could think about. All she wanted was a hot shower and that burger, but did she make that crystal clear to him. Or did she tell him once, on the way out the door or something. This guy needs burned at the stake just for letting a woman who is pregnant with his child to work two jobs\u2026he could flip burgers while looking for a \u2018real\u2019 job\u2026.but, I\u2019m just using this story to remind others that the rest of us can\u2019t hear the words in your own head.", "So, I do have to gently say ESH because making him sleep in his car is too much. But I do think that's the only area you're in the wrong. Sleeping on the couch/not in your bed would have been safer. I live somewhere where it's dangerous to sleep in your vehicle and it's pretty cold at night, so that might not be as big of a deal where you are?\n\nBut it does sound like the overall problem is that he consistently shows you that he's an inconsiderate partner and that boiled over. It's not just this burger and the hot water. It's doing things he knows you don't like, eating things without replacing them, etc. \"Small\" things add up and can absolutely make someone unpalatable to live with. If you're only together now because you're expecting, I heavily suggest rethinking that.", "NTA", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t too much to ask of anyone. And certainly not a lot considering the full situation. I\u2019m really sorry. Your partner doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s ready to be partnering.", "ESH for bringing an innocent child into this mess.  the father cant get a job and you\u2019re still in school.  your relationship is so unstable that he can\u2019t bother to get you a burger and you\u2019d make him sleep in his car.  imagine how much worse all of these issues are going to be once a screaming baby is waking you both up every few hours", "NTA. He is not working and he couldn't do what he said he would do. your pregnant self is the one who is the breadwinner. Ladies have some standards in the type of men you date and hook up with. Or else you will end up knocked up by a useless person like OP. Wish you the best.", "NTA\n\nYou would be an asshole if you kicked him out over a burger but there's a lot more than not getting a burger going on.", "ESH (but you only a tiny bit).\n\nFirst, the argument fundamentally isn\u2019t about a veggie burger.  It is about each of you feeling overwhelmed.  (You have great reasons to feel that way; he much less so).  He has the capability to make your life a bit easier but fails to do that.  But, more than that, he then doubles down to make your life harder.  And to make it about his (comparatively minor) challenges.  So, yea, total AH.\n\nBut, you can\u2019t kick your partner out of the house with every disagreement.  Yes, if you feel unsafe.  Yes, if you are doing it on a trial or permanent basis.  But in this instance you create a feeling of housing instability for your partner.  There is also a safety issue here as well.\n\nI guarantee the BF is telling others this is about hormones and food cravings.  Time for a conversation, not in anger, about how you need support and what that support looks like.  This is the hard part:  you also need to realize that he is feeling overwhelmed.  If we use a 1 to 10 scale of stress, his is around a five (kid on the way, newly living with partner, trying to find a job).  His feelings are what they are.  You are at about a ten (kid on the way, newly living with partner, have two jobs, difficult pregnancy, are the sole source of income, teacher training, etc).", "You are but you aren't. And that's because you're pregnant. Even little things are a major deal right now, you have extra hormones, probably getting uncomfortable and dealing with the stress of pregnancy in general. Add it the complications you mentioned and it is just a lot to deal with. Right now the smallest things will be stressors, things you would never even consider while not pregnant. Unfortunately it takes a bit after pregnancy to get your normal self back.\n\nGood luck with the rest of pregnancy. I hope all is well for you and baby and I hope you can get the burger you want", "YtA because you barely  know him and moved him in. You don't have to move in together to co-parent. He is giving you more stress than if you were single. Kick him out.", "NAH/ESH.  And, yes, I have been pregnant.  I have also cried b/c Starbucks was out of non-dairy milk.  But, you are both tired and stressed.  Reddit commenters love to make everything a competition, \"who's more tired/does more housework/works harder...\"  Couples are 1) human and 2) a team (ideally.)  Stuff goes on, big emotions happen.", "I say ESH.\n\nBeing upset with everything you have going on because you didn't get a food you really want and enjoy is totally valid and reasonable. Especially when he knew in advance what you wanted and the time restrictions. He has a lot more flexibility in his day than you do and is home more so he should shoulder a higher percentage of the home tasks.\n\nYou're AH because you made him sleep in his car after moving away from all of his supports. This is a new relationship, a new town, a new living situation, and messing with someone's housing stability is an AH move. That can be incredibly traumatic for someone. Sleeping in another room is vastly different than 'you're not welcome inside'. And, yes, I say this knowing he f'd up.\n\nExpectations, boundaries, plans, and these kinds of things needed to be discussed previously but y'all aren't setting up a solid foundation here.", "ESH. He sucks because he had more than enough time to get your burger before you got home. You suck for forcing a human being that you supposedly love enough to have a child with to sleep in a car over a stupid burger.", "ESH. Yeah, he should have gotten you the burger. But kicking him out, when you know he doesn't have anywhere else to go? A bit of an overreaction.", "ESH. Him for obvious reasons. Sorry to be blunt, but your boyfriends a loser. 28, no job, stressed out from simply looking? That\u2019s kind of pathetic. Yes, he offered Burger King, but he was trying to make up for not prioritizing what you asked for. \n\nAs for you, I know you\u2019re stressed out and hormonal. My wife and I have been through this twice and it\u2019s a really horrible feeling. Everything seems like it\u2019s closing in on you. You\u2019re strong and doing the best you can so you have my respect for that. \n\nThat being said, making your boyfriend leave when he has no place to go is beyond unacceptable. He slept in his car? You were seriously okay with that? The father of your child and the man you claim to love? How could you lay your head down on your pillow and go to sleep knowing he was out sleeping in his car? I don\u2019t care what horrible thing my wife said to me\u2014the thought of me casting her out of my house and making her sleep in the car makes me feel physically ill. \n\nI would seriously recommend working on conflict resolution, because that\u2019s horrifying.", "ESH. I think he should've gotten you the food or at least apologized when he forgot. I think you have a reason to be upset. \n\nBut this is, at most, rises to the level of making him sleep on the couch, not kicking him out of the house/apartment. \n\nAs a side note: As someone else pointed out, having a kid with this guy doesn't mean you have to be in a relationship with him. Neither of you seem to be too enthusiastic about that part. Maybe you two should sit down, talk it over, and consider not being together, just co-parenting.", "ESH. He did you wrong but at the same time sleeping in you car in November is not fun. Couldn't just have him sleep on the couch?", "You weren\u2019t an asshole until you made him sleep in his car. That\u2019s absurd and over the line. Ask him to drive around for an hour so you can have alone time? Fine. Have him sleep on the couch or even camp out on the floor? Fine. But throwing him out when he has no where to go is not right. \n\nIs he inconsiderate during a time when he should be overly considerate? For sure, and that would have gotten him the lone title of asshole. But being forced to sleep in his car over this? That would be outright dangerous in my city not to mention just cruel. \n\nESH. You\u2019ve both let the circumstantial stress get to you but you both need to work on being supportive instead of adversarial.", "[deleted]", "The only reason I think YTA is because you kicked him out knowing he had no where else to go. That is down right cold. But I think all your other feelings are completely valid. I could never kick out my loved one knowing they had to sleep in a car.", "What's the history with his unemployment, people in the comments are calling him a mooch and a deadbeat when that's entirely unclear and he could very well be someone who just lost his job and is looking for one\n\nAlso, did he want to be a father or has he decided to become one after you decided to keep the baby, there is a lot of historical context missing here.\n\nDid you tell him to make sure that hot water was saved up for you? How long would it take for the water to reheat ?\n\nTo me, making him sleep in the car because you didn't get a burger is a bit much. If you were craving a burger so badly, why did you just order it yourself ?", "ESH. Making someone sleep in their car over something this stupid as a total asshole move but when you take into account all the other things that your comments etc have stated it sounds like him being completely inconsiderate & incompetent is a common occurrence and this was just the straw that broke the camels back. \nI\u2019d strongly suggest reconsidering whether him living with you *is* helping given he doesn\u2019t seem to be paying rent and isn\u2019t doing all the household chores instead like he promised.  \n\nI\u2019d suggest giving him a months written notice that he needs to either have a full time job or have moved out. It needs to be written cause otherwise he can just claim he\u2019s a tenant & no notice was given.", "ESH. You did overreact. He sucks for not finding a job somewhere. Minimum wage jobs aren\u2019t hard to find. You suck for bringing a child into this mess when neither of you are prepared for the responsibility of parenthood.", "ESH.\n\nWhat he did was absolutely wrong.  No doubt about that.\n\nBut you also asked him to leave his place of residence, effectively forcing him to either got a hotel room (which I imagine he can't afford), or sleep in his car (which may be illegal depending on where you were).", "Well, I think this is a case of ESH. Yes he should have got you the burger. No you shouldn't have made him sleep in his car over night. If you move in with your partner it's both of your homes at that point. You don't get to throw someone out over a burger. \n\nBeing pregnant is stressful and uncomfortable and you're going to snap. As a partner of a pregnant person your boyfriend should take better care of you.", "ESH. I was going to say NTA but keeping someone out of their home at night over this argument is awful.", "What does technically I'm working two jobs mean? Are these both paid jobs or is one volunteer or something? This doesn't make sense to me. Either way if you didn't get home til 840 was it expected to be home waiting for you or were you not leaving til then? I don't think I'm following this post right lol. Either way to kick him out over it knowing he'd be staying in his car is too much. I understand you're pg but this is unnecessary (if I'm understanding correctly and yes I understand what it's like).", "ESH. Crying over a burger isn't the problem.. I have no doubt your hormones are going crazy and that's a pretty normal reaction. However, you shouldn't have kicked him out.. that made you the AH. So his perspective is he has no job and his gf is going to kick him out everytime they argue. I would feel overwhelmed too. He was the AH for not getting the burger before they closed. I highly doubt he was job searching after 8pm.", "ESH\n\nhe\u2019s an asshole for not getting you your burger \n\nKicking him out was a big over reaction", "Currently pregnant myself-34 weeks now. I get that you\u2019re upset about the burger, but you kicked him out over it? I get that we have hormones and cravings, but contrary to popular belief, we CAN control our actions and it\u2019s never ever an excuse to treat our partners like that. You\u2019re not an asshole for your feelings and cravings and hormones, but YTA for your actions that you can control. He went to two different places to correct it.

I know you were disappointed but your relationship won\u2019t last if you\u2019re *kicking him out of your shared home* over one burger.

Making him sleep in his car is not.\n\nYTA", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been pregnant so I have no issue saying it. Pregnancy hormones and craving are not a reason to treat your partner like this over food. If you wanted it that bad you could have made sure you got it. \n\nThis never should have been a serious argument. \n\nPeople will say he sucks for not ordering. But honestly he probably just forgot. If he\u2019s looking for a job while you\u2019re acting like this over every trivial thing, I bet he feels stress and pressured. His feelings aren\u2019t  invalid because you\u2019re pregnant. Asking him to sleep in the car over this is absolutely insane and I don\u2019t see how you\u2019re going to make a relationship work tbh.", "YTA\n\nYou decided to make a baby with this man, 6 months in and you are already complaining and quarrelling over a burger. \nNot the brightest idea. And now there is probably no solution to be had.", "Yta. You made him sleep in the car because you didn't get what you wanted for dinner? Are you really going to raise your children to believe this is how people act?", "YTA.\n\nEveryone is reading a novel between the lines instead of the actual details of your situation.  I've been married for almost 15yrs now and I can tell you my wife and I aren't anywhere near done disappointing each other. But we're committed to not hurting each other.   You've got to either dig your heels in and resolve to not hurt each other or get into a back and forth cold war until you break up.  I can't think of a scenario i'd put someone out of my house unless I never wanted to see them again.  Putting him out because you're stressed, disappointed, annoyed is just trying to hurt him back and that makes YTA. Ppl aren't safe around you if you hurt people when they make you disappointed--because life is full of disappointment.  \n\nAlso, you might want to ask how is he helping with your pregnancy. You being pregnant isn't a reason to move in. You might want to have a good talk about that part. Like  why did he think he needed to move in? What did he expect to do when he got there? If he's not helping but hurting he should go.", "ESH him for not helping out more and not taking care for you. You for letting someone sleep in a car for a freaking burger. He could have slept on the couch or something.  \nFor the baby, I'm already feel sorry for it, what will become of it with folks like this. If the love is not there, you shouldn't make it do... either you start living together and take care of it together or separate and take of it yourselves. If you don't plan on making babies, or if your not grown up enough,  please use contraception.", "YTA Not for being upset because of the burger and the hot shower those were understandable and your bf certainly showed a lack of consideration here. But kicking him out over something minor at the end of the day when he has no real place to go, that is abusive territory.", "YTA. Kicking him out was way over the top. He screwed up by not ordering and I can understand you were upset, but him needing to sleep in his car is just not an ok way to live. \n\nYou are under a lot of pressure, and you are working a lot while he is at home. Job hunting is hard work but I can see why you feel he could maybe have ordered or been more sympathetic. But its not a competion over who is more hard done by, I think if you want to live together in any kind of peace you need to stop trying to compare who is more overwhelmed and start trying to work together. (This is obviously two sided and will also require him to do the work). \n\nYou are in a tough position and a baby on the way is hard and stressful, but try to start leaning on each other and sharing your stress, not taking it out on each other. \n\nGood luck!!", "Esh....granted you got in at 840 but you know his history you'd be better off ordering and picking up your own food", "All N T As need to consider its this guys baby too, you cant just rid the kid of a father.

Dude is worthless.", "I\u2019m sure he was showering off the smell of pot, perfume and p-**$", "So when Child Protective Services eventually removes your baby from the home (while you're out working one of two jobs) because it's neglected and undernourished, is your boyfriend's defense going to be \"She didn't leave me a list! How should I know that I should feed a baby or change diapers without a list??\"", "Yeah to \u201cdo housework & look for jobs\u201d should not require a to-do list. Effectively she is still managing the house by identifying tasks. And he can\u2019t complete simple ones. If being SAH is his job rn, he should be fired", "I have an alarm set for 2:45 every day to run and tidy up/vacuum. I definitely do more throughout the day, but I know it's unpleasant to walk into a mess after a day of work, so I save that for the last minute.", "It do believe he felt overwhelmed.  I do too when I procrastinate all day.  I'm in anticipation and at the starting line all day but can't get moving.  I've wasted days that way.  Feel like shit about it too.\n\nBut I also don't get in relationships because people want to change that dynamic and have me act busy like they do even though I ultimately get more accomplished than they do.  It's just in high energy microbursts when they're not around.\n\nBut what they don't witness doesn't exists and fuck that solipsistic shit and fuck \nInefficient martyrs.  Your life is a mess and mine just looks like one.", "Have you seen the sites with \"auto apply\" buttons? They automatically enter all your info and submit the app. You can have a dozen apps submitted in under an hour.", "I will put it this way, I have been out of a job since my last one fired me while on covid leave this was in July. Now in November I have sent hundreds of apps and had no bites or gotten rejected despite interviewing well. It sucks and the job market is not as great as a lot of people make it out to be", "Totally agree, I'm often in that cycle of feeling overwhelmed, and doing a lot of nothing because I'm waiting feel magically better before I do anything. Yay, ADHD. Fortunately, I'm sometimes insanely productive to make up for it, usually between the hours of 6 and 9 pm.\n\nI've actually been in some great relationships with people who totally get it and let me do my thing without shaming me for it. There's hope for people like us! But I definitely wouldn't lie to a partner about my work habits, let them  unfairly pull my weight, or fail to apologize profusely for letting them down... this is where OP's boyfriend is wrong.", "Lol when I cook a veggie meal, my husband says this would be great with some meat!", "I don\u2019t know which sites y\u2019all have been using but they were all terrible back when I was job hunting, the sites would parse the resumes wrong in different ways every time, it would be a tedious slog to fix all the fields after making new accounts for each company, then there\u2019s all the random tests they want you to do. extra long ones for recruiters, and they usually want an interview or two as well. \n\nanyway, job hunting isn\u2019t easy, but that makes no difference in this situation. the boyfriend guy is definitely an asshole and there\u2019s no excuse for treating her the way he did.", "I had to lie so much to the job centre after leaving uni. They wanted so many hours of searching a week, but I signed up for all the big job sites, set up the notifications for the sort of jobs I was looking at, and left it to email me anything relevant. Applying never took too much longer than filling in a form and reworking some cover letters occasionally", "Exactly. People used to say how\u2019s the job hunt going\u2014 did you find anything today? And what am I supposed to answer yes I spent the entire day looking at what?\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason why I was looking only every other day. The depression of not seeing anything new or not having anywhere to apply was so much that I couldn\u2019t stand to do it every day. And then it was done in no more than two hours.\n\nTook me 10 months. In my life I\u2019ve never been so long without a job and I never thought it would be so hard.

I'm sorry.", "He didn\u2019t just fail her-he blamed the fight on her too-high expectations!", "Moving in with OP is a bonus for the boyfriend-he isn\u2019t paying rent, or utilities.  And all he had to do was pick up her dinner.  I guess if that\u2019s too hard, it\u2019s no wonder he can\u2019t find a job", "I'd had such shitty boyfriends in the past that when I found my, now, fiance, I felt like I won the lotto. He had a job, helped me with everything, was respectful, etc. \n\nWhen we decided to have our first (my second), I already knew the kind of father he'd be. I was worried about favoritism but it has never happened. \n\nWhen someone tells you who they are, listen!", "No, hell be a \u201cstay at home dad\u201d and still sit on his ass all day scrolling through stuff on his phone and make her do most of the work", "Just to give you some words of encouragement, I was the man in this situation about 8 months back. I found the best job I've ever had (35k salary plus commission and I'm currently at about 60k a year when you add my book of business to my salary) and I'm taking care of the sweet, sweet, hearted woman who saw the world in me when I had absolutely nothing. I got the job in may and my son was born in July. She worked three jobs! Took care of my scrub self and loved every minute of it. Now I get to provide for her and my child and it's incredibly exhausting but also the best feeling in the world. I hope this man makes these changes for you and y'all's child, as the man that nobody had faith in (aside from my sugar bear); I'd like to believe he will.\n\nI already commented this statement, but I wanted to again in response to yours to show that there is a chance, I was literally bottom of the barrel- with her support- I climbed myself out.", "Yeah. He will say he\u2019s too good for that.", "I mean its not like he even has to do that. A tipped restaurant job is better paying and easy to get right now.", "Yeah in my experience of the people i know in real life who are \u201cjob hunting\u201d for months but can\u2019t find a job - they *can* find a job, just not the kind of job they *want*.", "My 16 yo daughter got her first job this year and will be promoted to asst manager at her store as soon as the boss' boss approves it.

Landscaping. Fencing. Decking. Construction. Even if BF can't find salaried work right away, he could be bringing money into the household.", "Lol I just had to look up this reference.... Hilarious!", "My Ex was the same way. I worked a very stressful job (funeral service), cooked, cleaned, drove (he had no license) all because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to work fast food and wanted to be a substitute teacher with no credentials\u201d He would watch tv for 8 hours and then suddenly when I got home need to do 6 hours of schoolwork and job hunt. OP it doesn\u2019t get better. Remove the leech.", "Exactly this. Having a mannequin on the sofa would provide more support than a selfish leech. Poor baby, will grow up learning this toxic dynamic.", "> He'll blame playing with baby as the reason he didn't look for jobs. \n\nAnd baby will still have a very, very full diaper whenever OP comes home from work.

It\u2019s not too difficult to get hired quickly and even if it were part time, he wouldn\u2019t be a complete deadbeat. \n\nA similar situation happened when I was 21. I ended up moving in with the guy but at least my ex was willing to work in a construction job that thankfully put food into he table \u2014 including my proclivity to gyros while I was pregnant.\n\nOP please take care of yourself; there is only one child you need to worry about and it\u2019s the one in your belly. If you need to, kick this guy to the curb because it will get worse as others have said.", "Question, what's with the say happy cake day?\n\nSorry for being OT. NTA, you are hormonal, working two jobs, and probably doing the bulk of the work in your apartment as well. BF needs to step up and be a man!", "I'm wondering what this Prince of a man did before he met OP? She says he moved in to help her with a difficult pregnancy but I don't see any examples of him doing that. She's working two jobs while he slouches on the couch all day; how is that helping?\n\nPresumably he had to pay rent when he last lived before he moved in with OP so he must have worked. His sudden state of unemployability started when he moved in with OP,  how odd (she said sarcastically).  If he really wanted to work he could find a job in a day. Because he's no longer in a due or die situation,  he can be picky about what job he'll accept.  OP, you need to send this useless oaf back from whence he came.  Give him a choice, he has 1 week to find a job or leave the house. You are paying a lot of extras now he's living there. And I'm sure beyond electric and hydro, you're probably paying his phone bill and giving him spending money.  Let me guess, you've meshed your bank accounts together?\n\nHe is more of a hindrance than a help and with a baby on the way, that's the last thing you need.  He needs to start working and paying at least 1/2 of all the bills and put money aside for your baby's birth, otherwise you need to kick his lazy ass to the curb.  The hamburger is the least of it but it shows he doesn't really care about your well-being.  He needs to change fast, like yesterday,  or you need to boot him for your well-being and that of your daughter's.", "You shouldn\u2019t have to be asking him once to do what he agreed to do. You having to ask him hasn\u2019t taken a job off your plate, it\u2019s just added a different job. Girl, he\u2019s a freeloader. He could have a job by now, he just doesn\u2019t want to.", "My friend got pregnant with her husband using condoms even. They were ready in their 30s though. My sister was told she was infertile and had endometriosis and not to worry about it and she just gave birth this summer due to using no birth control at 25.  Doctors don\u2019t really know shit about fertility.", "Question\u2026 when was the last time he had a job? Has he ever had steady employment? Did he move from his own place into yours?", "As an old lady, who doesn\u2019t like to say \u201c I am old so I know better than anyone\u201d because I happen to have made a certain age, you are spot on!

I am glad you are doing better, Dear!\u2764\ufe0f", "Wow, he really jumped on that as a reason and an excuse that he actually told you about? Instead of acting like a normal human adult and listening to the millions of other people, books, parents, and basic logic that would say that he should do all the housework things while you are at work, so you can rest when you get home.\n\nI'm sorry that he is latching on to any excuse to stop himself from doing his fair share and any of the thinking in your household.\n\nWould it be possible for him to move out so you have your clean house back, and then he can come over on weekends or join you for dinner or something? Because it really sounds like you are doing way too much work here, and he moved in without even being expected to do the basic housemate work of cleaning up after himself.", "Yeah, everyone's mileage is going to vary based on where you are. But at minimum there's resources (at least in my state) to help build resumes, find open work or in a last ditch scenario get you in with a temp agency to at least start building some kind of income.", "This isn\u2019t true at all. Doctors are often borderline obsessed with fertility in female patients and are well known for bringing it up as if it\u2019s the most pressing concern, even when it\u2019s totally irrelevant or even inappropriate to do so.", "Not necessarily true. When I was diagnosed with essential thrombozythemia at age 16, my doctors sure told me something about my supposed fertility. \"You'll always have trouble conceiving, and when you do, don't expect to have a baby at the end of it.\"\n\nYeah, right. \\*scoffs\\* And I was most definitely not trying back then.", "This dude doesn't know what it's like to have a manager apparently", "Also, ask yourself if that's the example you want to give your child. If you have a son, do you want him to normalize that he won't ever have to lift a finger because women have to do anything? Would you want a daughter to normalize that?", "Partners should respect one another's rest time!  But yeah, we all try to \"look busy\" anyway, we've got reputations to barely maintain, LOL.", "It took my bf 6 months to find another job and the ONLY reason it took him so long is because we only have 1 car that I need for my job so he was limited to just the small college town we were in. And he felt terrible, because he saw how it was affecting me. He\u2019d do laundry, do the dishes, take care of the animals, etc. while applying. He never did it all day every day and he\u2019d game for sure, but I didn\u2019t touch a damn chore beyond cooking and sometimes dishes on my days off.", "If he's looking for factory work, a lot of places delegate the hiring to temp agencies. That way they get to try out employees before offering a job. So if he's avoiding those, he shouldn't. Years after getting a job that way (applied online), my husband still gets calls for job interviews from the agency.\n\nBut I agree with the others. NTA. It's not about the burger. And I'm sure he is stressed about the changes, but your boyfriend is playing video games all day. It's not going to get better unless he has an attitude change.", "As if \"freeloading bum\" isn't worse than any job going out there that isn't a health or legal concern!", "Yea, my husband changed jobs earlier this year and while it was time consuming at the beginning of his job hunt, because he was looking up and applying for any open reqs in his field, once he \"caught up\" on what was already posted, it was much less work. \n\nI could see spending 1-3 days spending the full day applying for jobs, depending on your field, but after that? There's just not enough jobs being posted to spend that much time on it.", "What you\u2019re doing is applying for jobs, true.  But applying for jobs that require any specific skills, and are jobs you actually hope to get, require tailoring your resume to those jobs and the job description.  You can\u2019t just submit the same resume for every job.  Also some jobs have questions and you have to review the questions in advance, decide how you will answer, etc.\n\nNot that I think the boyfriend is doing any of those things or has those kinds of skills because he sounds like a loser\u2026 I think he\u2019s fucking around all day and prepping for the life of a deadbeat dad.", "I mean, that mostly mirrors my current job hunting... but it's a little more involved since most of these damn applications want you to resubmit your entire fucking resume field-by-field each time, so I find it takes a while to process more than a couple a day with how mind numbingly tedious it gets.\n\ngranted, that's in a specialized field with limited openings unless you're willing to move cross-country... from the sounds of things, OP's BF needs to just be applying to every fucking thing imaginable right now because *a job* should be a higher priority for them than the *right* job.\n\n\n... but also yes, he's 1000% just sitting there playing video games all day with a Glassdoor tab open on the side.", "When I was 19 with PCOS, I was told that I would have trouble getting pregnant even though I didn't ask about that.", "And there are tons and tons of \"middle ground\" jobs one can just simply walk in and take.  Fast food will reject NO ONE, and it's almost immediately helping pay bills.  It's not glorious work, but even part time fast food or wait staffing somewhere is SOMETHING, and job hunting can still happen regularly for something better.\n\nSeriously.  I can walk into any of a dozen businesses in my little home town and literally have a job in 5 minutes.  Some might ask me to stay for my first shift right that moment.  Places are hurting for workers.  Not glamorous, but it's respectable work.", "If OP\u2019s boyfriend was actually having interviews or even showed any other signs of actively searching for a job, I would 100% agree with you that this is the likely case.
