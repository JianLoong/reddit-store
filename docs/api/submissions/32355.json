Seems pretty simple unless I'm missing something.", "My entire husband's side of the family is like this. It used to drive me *insane* that I would finish cooking and then my husband would start setting the table, getting beverages, getting condiments, thinking about sides...a whole 10 minute rigamarole while the food got cold.\n\nAnd then we had dinner at his parents. A good 30 minutes went by from the time my mother-in-law finished cooking and then all of a sudden after the food was done very slowly made a salad, and elaborately set out a thousand sides and condiments and, etc. all of which could have been done by anyone else while she was cooking while the food just...cooled.\n\nIt's even worse when they get take-out somehow? We even went multiple rounds of reheating the same food in the microwave because it had cooled off before it got to the table.\n\nI have *no idea* why they're like this. It's super out of character. They're otherwise the highest executive functioning people I've ever met. They're always 10 minutes early, always detail-oriented with every task. But somehow they're terrified of actually hot food. I've given up on waiting for my husband to come to the table to start eating. I'll dish out food for myself and the kid and will eat for 10-15 minutes while my husband does who-knows-what before he finally sits down.", "Depends on the take out, hot chips(fries) or anything with lettuce on it is foul microwaved.", "For sure bit depending on the food, heating it up can suck. Like try heating up fries, poutine, burgers, pizza, pho, steak, etc. It just degrades some food.\n\nPlus, let's get real. It's not about not being able to heat up food, it's about paying for the convenience of takeout so that you don't have to prepare, cook, heat up the food in the first place.\n\nOne off times, not an issue. But this sounds like a pattern, OP is correct in being uncompromising especially since their other siblings also complain.\n\nOP NTA", "May I ask what tap has to do with OP's situation?", "So you're also paying for your siblings food when you pick up?", "i have adhd and i simply get ready to go before hitting order.", "Have you asked why it is they do this, or tried making all of the sides, setting the table, and such and seeing his reaction? It would be more work on you to ask what he wanted to drink ten min before the food was ready, but at least then it would be ready. I'm curious now, too!", "Get an air fryer! Air fryers are amazing for reheating/cooking small batches of crispy food.", "Well, sure, you don't put fries in the *microwave*.\n\nI find they reheat best in a combi oven around 230F and 15% humidity.", "i think they're saying if op's parents have tap they can give op their card and op can pay for the food using that when they go pick it up, instead of having to pay for it themselves since they have to pay at the restaurant", "I'm paying for all the food when I pick it up.", "same lol, i always make sure im 100% ready, shoes on and everything, before ordering food, requesting an uber, ect. i know how my adhd affects me and i just make sure to figure out work arounds to make things go smoothly (most of the time). it's not easy, but if it's important to you you'll put the effort into making it work", "Hard agree. The world doesn't stop for ADHD. People are still expected to be at work on time, and in this case, listen to the concerns of their children and adjust accordingly. If the kids are always complaining about cold food it's their job as parents to put some hustle in their bustle and adjust.\n\nI also have ADHD, it impacts every single aspect of my life, but I've been seeing it used as a crutch to justify unacceptable behaviors more and more online, it's honestly really concerning, and frankly, insulting and infantilizing. I would be mortified if I was consistently serving or bringing home cold food to my family.", "Hi OP's parent, I didn't recognize you! Gee! Oh wait... you're not them...", "I've never even met anyone who could  *control the  humidity* of their oven. I can't even control the humidity of my house.", "Could you order it every time and just tell your parents an earlier pickup time when it's their time to pick it up?", "Thank you for my new life hack.", "This had me snort laughing. Thank you!", "They are *wonderful*. I never knew what I was missing until I got one.", "Cool. I'll have to look them up."]}
