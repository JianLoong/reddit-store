I mean, refusing to grab your parents food just feels like an asshole move. **But**, this thing about forcing you to pay if you go early to get the food while it's early seems crazy. You are **doing them a favor**, going to get the food, so they punish you? That just seems all screwed up, like they are playing control games with you. But honestly, this whole situation feels too weird, like there is something missing from the story. Why would they want cold food? I don't get it.", "NTA\n\nThey said if they pay you can't be impatient. You were fine with that. You paid for your food, and went and got it. They went and picked up their own order. Lovely bit of malicious compliance.", "Info:  Do you pay rent?", "NTA.\n\nSome people, yes, even adults who have adult children, can only learn by experiencing something.\n\nToday, they learnt you don't want cold food, and you don't want to have to be paying for everyone's takeout every time just to get hot food. Just like they suggested to you as a solution when they made the comment about being patient. You found a solution for you. And they don't like it. \n\nHopefully now they'll be open to discussing an actual solution that fits everyone. Even your siblings if they often too complain the food is cold.\n\n>I (24 f) live with my parents and siblings because rent is crazy right now and my job isn't great\n\nYou don't have to justify why you live at home at 24.

You don't have an obligation to get and pay for theirs just as they agreed and explained.  \n\nYTA because you ordered their food as well and set up the expectation without explaining anything.  Had you said from the start, \"Hey, I've ordered my food separately and am going to pick it up and pay for it because I like it hot, but I can't afford to pay for all of it.  If you want me to get yours too, I'm leaving in 10 minutes.\"  \n\nThat would have avoided the shock of you walking in having obviously done all the legwork but making no effort to look out for the others in the household.

You are the reason everybody eats hot food when you all order takeout. There is no reason that you should be left to indefinitely absorb the cost of four extra meals to do them this favor. It sucks that your siblings had to eat cold food, but if you had waited for your mom to go get the food (which is the alternative on offer), then they still would\u2019ve been eating cold food; the only way they ever get a hot meal is when you do your parents a favor.
