We were friends for a while before we began dating so I knew her family pretty well before we began dating.\n\nMy wife has three sisters, two younger and one older, and to put it bluntly her older sister does not care for me at all, she\u2019s made it clear she doesn\u2019t believe that I am good enough for my wife and she could do better. She has been married the last decade, she got pregnant at 18 so they believed they needed to get married to appease his family.\n\nAbout a month ago she came over to my wife and I\u2019s home sobbing saying that her husband had left her for another woman? leaving her with their four kids. Although we don\u2019t have the greatest relationship she is still family so I felt really bad for her, so for the last month and I my wife and I have basically spent all of our free time with my sister-in-law and our nieces and nephews, I even helped her haul boxes of her ex-husbands stuff out of their house one a very cold and rainy day, which also happened to be my one day off that week. We have also been helping out financially by helping with rent, bills and groceries.\n\nYesterday morning my wife was taking my sister-in-law out for a girls day, when I dropped my wife off at her sisters place I kissed her and told her that I loved her. Her sister watched all of this, I could tell her mood dropped when she saw us. After I left, I got a call maybe 20 minutes later from my wife asking me to pick her up.\n\nI did and my wife was pissed, she told me sister-in-law had blown up at her, calling us insensitive to her situation and horrible people for not putting a stop to the PDA while she was around. My wife and I are not super into PDA but we always kiss whenever we say goodbye so I didn\u2019t realise it was a big deal, my wife told me my sister-in-law has been making it a huge deal and calling up other family members to try and get them on her side. My wife is pissed and I can\u2019t help but feel like it\u2019s all my fault.

Showing a healthy relationship in public is fine. Yall weren't making out. \n\nSister needs to stop taking everything normal as an attack. She needs therapy.", "NTA and your wife is NTA either. Just because your sister in law is going through a difficult time doesn't mean that YOUR relationship should suffer because of it. Your signs of affection and appreciation are YOUR relationship thing. Her imagining that everyone will stop whatever is healthy in their relationship as soon as she is in the picture because she is right now in this situation is major selfishness and lack of awareness. Stand by your wife, you two have it right. You are supporting her in all material and emotional ways possible, but this is just going over the boundary of her relationship and into yours.", "Wtf no NTA, in no way. Your SIL can't just expect everyone around her to not touch or even look at their partner while she is around. Kiss your wife goodbye and tell her you love her, don't care about your SIL she is overreacting.", "NTA, i dont even need to say anything else, thats how much NTA you are.", "NTA. You never know if your next goodbye will be your last. Kiss your fucking wife.", "HARD NTA!!!\nLoving your wife, being affectionate towards her, or just being a good husband. These things don't make you the AH. After all the help and support you and your wife have provided to the SIL, she should realise that you two harbour no ill intentions towards her or her situation.\nYou do you OP.", "NTA\n\nYou're not the ah. You didn't do it on purpose to rub it in your SIL's face. It was just a reflex because it's normal.\n\nYou kissing your wife and telling her you love her has nothing to do with your SIL's relationship. Yes, maybe you should've thought about it, giving the vulnerability of your SIL right now, but she kinda sucks for getting upset at you. It's normal for her to get sad seeing it, but upset? That's a bit much, imo.\n\nIt's normal for you to kiss your wife and say you love her. Your SIL shouldn't expect you to change your relationship for her or to walk on eggshells for her. It'll hurt for her to see that, but she shouldn't be getting angry over it, imo.", "NTA --- Sounds like a SIL problem to me, you keep right doing what you're doing with your wife if it was me I start doing it even more when she is around just to piss her off.", "NTA\n\nYou're allowed to kiss your wife. Your SIL needs to get over herself. Especially when the people she's freaking out on have spent the last few moths taking care of her and her children.", "this is what in Portugal we call \"eating in front of the poor\", but mostly when you are going thru a breakup and your friend couple keeps kissing and doing those \"clingy\" stuff in front of you non-stop.  \n\n\nNTA. It's not like you did anything out of your way or overdid something to rub in her face.  \nYou did something simple, and basic. It's not your job to walk around eggshells around her", "NTA, might be time to back away from helping out so much, you did abdolutely nothing wrong, SIL is being unreasonable in their grief, it is understandable but not acceptable.", "NTA, Although it's horrible what happened to her and I feel bad for you SIL, this has always been something you guys have done and that doesn't mean you can't show love towards your wife.", "NTA- You are absolutely not an AH for showing love to your wife. I also don\u2019t think your SIL is an AH for being upset, but she is a bit rude for bringing other family members into it.", "NTA - Cut off all help, financial support, don't spend your free time with the kids anymore and block her.  Leave your wife free to go if she likes, but don't count on your help. Your SIL is envious and bitter", "NTA. A simple kiss and \"I love you\" between spouses is so innocuous and common. It can slip by you before the thought even crosses your mind that you should tone it down in front of a (soon to be) divorcee. If you should at all.\n\nI have the feeling that had SIL shown her dismay in a less agressive way, and asked you guys nicely to tone it down, then you could have decided to humour her. But it _is_ humouring her. You are under no obligation to do it; it would be a favour.", "NTA. LOL this can't be real...", "NTA. She might have been through pretty harsh stuff and can be very sensitive about everything that reminds her terrible break up, However happy marriages and happy couples do exist. She can't stay away from this forever and she doesn't have right to stop couple's simple habits just because she gets triggered.", "NTA\n\nKinda shocked you gotta ask. Your SIL sounds oversensitive and looking to start shit to feel something.", "NTA. I think the SIL has always fallen victim to a little sibling rivalry. Saying 'goodbye, love you' is hardly being insensitive to her situation. SIL has jealousy issues. You and your wife need to get on the same page with this. It sounds like her sister made her feel bad and now she's blaming you which is completely unfair.", "Absolutely NTA. I get that your SIL is having a rough time, but that does NOT mean everyone around her should be as miserable.\n\n(Also, really nice to see a man talk about his wife in such a sweet way on this sub for once lol)", "NTA. What a lunatic.", "NTA. \n\nYou never know when your goodbye is the last one. I tell my family, close friends and anyone else I love that I love them at the end of every phone conversation, when we say goodbye at the end of in person meetings, and frankly I just tell them I love them as and when I think about it.\n\nIt sucks that the sister is going through this, but your life and your relationship with your wife doesn't stop because of it.", "Nta. Maybe a little PDA would have helped SIL's marriage.", "NTA.  She is (not without reason) feeling sorry for herself; you\u2019ve turned over your lives to her to be helpful and loving family members - that she would ALSO expect you to alter your usual loving behavior to your wife is a bit beyond the pale.", "NTA...and good on you for being the bigger person through all of this.", "NTA and I never understood people who immediately start calling family and friends to complain and draw them in made up drama...\n\ncan you imagine getting a call on a mundane afternoon and it's your cousin going on and on how her BIL dared to kiss his wife goodbye... I would hang up and tell the to get a life lol", "NTA\n\nYou did everything you could to help in a tough situation, the SIL was bitter to start and now her nerves are raw, nothing you can really do about that.\n\nSide note: All of you need to read the whole damn post. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re creating s narrative that the wife is pissed at OP, she is pissed at the situation that her sister blew up at her for the pda.

It sucks what your SIL is going through, but she needs to get over herself.

Why isn't your wife on your side?", "Well it is your normal behavior so no, NTA. However, since you are now aware that it makes your SIL uncomfortable during this time in her life then I wouldn't do it in front of her from now on. You added a lot of filler about how she doesn't like you which I think was unnecessary to the story.", "NTA. Tell your wife if she wants you to kiss and love somebody else and would like join her sister as a single woman. JK. LOL. Kidding aside, its not your fault that you presently have a healthy relationship. \n\nHave a good talk your wife, She's probably being guilt trip by her sister for having a stable relationship with you. This is the time you need to remind each other that youre supposed to have each other's back. And not be mad at you for something you normally do.\n\n Maybe also distance yourselves with the sister. She's toxic.", "NTA", "NTA, you didn\u2019t do it purposely to upset her she\u2019s the one who let it get to her", "NTA I understand why SIL is upset but you did nothing wrong. She could've had a mature conversation with your and your wife like adults but instead she chose to lash out at the people helping her the most.", "NTA, sucks what happened to her but you shouldn't have to change how you interact with your wife because of her. She won't be able to hide from PDA from everyone.", "NTA, one of the most obvious ones Ive read in awhile", "NTA. If SIL can't stand being near you as you are, it is time to give her some space.  See if she is in a better place if you see her at Christmas", "Im flabbergasted that that you feel you don\u2019t have a right to kiss your wife because someone else\u2019s misfortune. Not you or your wife\u2019s problem that you have a good marriage. And shame on the rest of the family for looking down on it.

And contacting other family members to \u201cget them on her side\u201d is manipulative and not okay. Especially since those people aren\u2019t going out of their way to help her like OP and his wife are.", ">your wife is NTA either\n\nIt depends. If the wife is pissed at him then she is an asshole. If the wife is pissed at SIL then she isn't.", "NTA. Going off on the 2 people that have been lovingly supporting during a terrible time looks really bad.", "She was pissed that her sister was blowing up on her for the pda.", "I will never understand why this sub searches for a narrative that isn\u2019t there. There is nothing that suggests the wife isn\u2019t on OP side.", "OP is not obligated to stop being affectionate with his wife just because the SIL went through a break up.", "But the wife is angry at her sister? Not at OP. OP and his wife already have each other's back.", "Did you read the last paragraph?", "Agreed, he's not obligated to do that at all. But why continue to do it when he knows it upsets her?", "why not? It's not something very weird or abnormal to do, it's simply giving his wife a kiss. SIL doesn't like him anyway je doesn't owe her anything", "Well, the SIL didn't approve of OP anyway. So why stay married when he knows it upsets SIL?\n\nThe man is allowed to kiss his wife goodbye.", "You're absolutely right, he has no obligation to do it and he does not owe her anything. Never said he did. I think being the bigger person is always the best thing to do and so I would avoid PDA around the SIL to minimize the amount of drama she could stir up because she is TA and the OP and his wife are NTA like I said in my original post.", "Yes, as I said he can do whatever he wants to do. If it were me, I would not purposefully do things to upset people going through a hard time. Hyperbolic statements like they should just get divorced are just dumb and don't have anything to do with the situation. Like I said in my original post anyway he is NTA and I think the SIL is TA but being the bigger person in the future would benefit him and his wife the most and cause less drama so I gave that advice.", "SIL needs to be the bigger person. She is probably going to keep that \"no PDA because my husband left me\" for a long time, it's been a month and she still is acting like this.", "It's not like SIL got broken up with a day or a week ago, it's been a month. She really needs to move on and she needs to be the bigger person and be happy for her sister that she has a happy healthy relationship.", "If the SIL posted this then I would tell her that SITA and to be the bigger person and let her sister and her husband love eachother in peace. But she didn't post it, he did and so i'm telling him because resolving the conflict is the most important thing.", "Yeah true, she does need to move on but it is kinda unfair to say that someones grieving process should end after a month? Why? Grief is a personal thing and she should take as much time as she needs to be okay again, pretending to get herself together for the sake of others is just going to lead to another breakdown down the line.", "So for you resolving a conflict is just one of the people getting what they want and the others have to Change their very normal behavior? It's about finding a solution that fits all and just having the relationship of OP suffer is not that.", "Never said it's not okay to grieve for long, i worked as a nurse in a palliative care unit for two years, i know how grieve works and that it takes time. But it's unfair for the relationship of OP to suffer just because SIL doesn't feel like seeing her sister be in a happy and healthy relationship.", "[removed]", "Lol well you said \"it's been a month\" as if that is long enough. Is the relationship really suffering because they don't kiss in front of the SIL, god", "I don't either lol but SIL is being very unreasonable and she won't be able to avoid seeing PDA.", "Yes it's been a moth and i would belive that after a month she is ready to face the world again/ go outside and she will not be able to avoid seeing PDA while going somewhere. I would understand if husband left a week ago. \n\nYes i would not be too happy if i would have to stop kissing my bf goodbye and telling him i love him. I live by the thought of \"i never know if thats the last time i say goodbye to him\" so i'd rather show affection then trying to make someone happy that doesn't like me and doesn't seem to appreciate what i have been doing for her."]}
