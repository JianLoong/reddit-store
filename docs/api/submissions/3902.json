Any more context for the.. \"identified as black\" part??? What is that implying??", "NTA\u2026I\u2019ve had two black cats and they were the best pets I\u2019ve had.  Also black cats are the least adopted because people think they\u2019re \u201cbad luck\u201d.  \n\nI love cats but your friend needs therapy.  What they said is NOT normal.", "NTA!!! For those in the back: NOT THE ASSHOLE. The top 2 animals euthanized at shelters around the US are: Pit bulls & black cats. I\u2019m on black cat #4 & plan to stick with them for life", "Just tell them its fine because your new cat identify as a tabby cat.", "NTA.", "NTA, I Love Black cats. I dont think that anyone, should even suggest.That you dont get one. Over what? Their superstition? Those poor cats needing a home. Would sure love you!", "Of course NTA. Who could turn down that face? It sounds like you found a cat who fits in well with your family. Your friend is nuts. I rescue a lot of cats, and I'm just glad when they find a good home. Three of the cats here now are black. Should I have just left two on the street because of whatever your friend's bizarre reasoning is? This makes me mad honestly.  A nice cat found a nice home, but she twists it beyond recognition to make it all about her. Ripley, on the other hand, is clearly fabulous.", "I wanted to add to my previous comment by saying kudos to you for adopting a black cat. I'm sure you already know they are the last to get adopted. Grown cats also have a very hard time getting adopted. Everyone wants a small kitten. You did a good thing.", "Definitely NTA and Thanks for adopting a black cat! Those are the cats that are least likely to be adopted and really need good homes. I'm sorry that your friend has put such a weird condition on your pet adoption but don't let that influence you. Your friend sounds like she has some definite mental health issues.", ">I have no words.\n\nExactly. I think it\u2019s difficult to judge because definitely NTA for getting the cat, but probably YTA for not making that \u201ccat birther\u201d get mental health help.", "My two cats were black cats and I adopted them specifically because I was told black cats have a lower  chance of adoption than other cats (and a higher chance of being put down) due to superstitions, what people judge as pretty, lack of interest in adopting them, etc. I loved those boys so much and miss them daily. They were so friendly and loving. I also applaud OP for getting a black cat, they deserve so much love.", "I have a black cat. They're great! Also they are very common and sometimes are hard to adopt out. The friend is crazy. NTA.", "Dude I hate to say it but watch your wife and make sure she doesn't get rid of the cat or take her back to the shelter or give her away because of the friend", "I have a black cat who's 10 now and I have *maybe* a dozen pictures of her where she a) looks normal, b) looks black (not brown), and c) is a clear photo. It's brutal", "I have a white cat. It is impossible to get a decent photo of her because she is so derpy. \n\nMy brown tabby on the other hand is a natural poser.", "> we have one blind rabbit\n\ni already loved you & your wife for rescuing beautiful ripley since they are often overloooked at shelters but this made me tear up. you guys are fucking rockstars in my book.\n\nand NTA obviously. but that friend is ... something else indeed.\n\nenjoy your new addition to the family.", "i've had seven cats & of course i thought the world of all of them but i am constantly amazed at how unbelievably sweet my little black kitty is. and all the people i know who have adopted black kitties say the exact same thing. it's like they're all bred to be sweet beyond belief.", "Depends on the scenario, but there are scenarios where that is actually wholesome instead of crazy.", "that is so freaking adorable.", "Ugh. Hopefully your wife sees how toxic and unhinged this \"friend\" is. I used to work at a humane society and thank you for rescuing black animals.", "NTA and keep this friend away from your cat.", "NTA. Your friend needs serious therapy and you need to go NC with them until you do. I don\u2019t want to give an armchair diagnosis, but something is not right here.", "NTA, your friend is not well.", "NTA black cats often struggle to be adopted. Your friend needs help, so the cat should remain in a rescue because she called dibs on black cats?", "NTA! \n  First of all, sorry for the friend\u2019s loss, but stating you can\u2019t adopt a black cat because her\u2019s was black..? Yea no. Black cats are great! And it\u2019s so unreasonable of her to say that. All kitties need a home and black cats seem to be less likely to get one. Enjoy your cat and give \u2018em lots of pets and kisses!", "Black kitties are the bestest kind, with or without white accents. Many, many people have had special relationships with black kitties, and that\u2019s certainly no reason why you shouldn\u2019t have one yourself. You\u2019re totally NTA. She\u2019s being pretty weird about the whole situation. I\u2019ve had dearly beloved cat-babies myself, and that has absolutely nothing to do with other people and their own relationships with cats.", "Black cats have a hard enough time getting adopted,  how could anyone who loves black cats(I have 2) demand someone else not adopt one knowing that they get killed more often in shelters than any other color cat. \n\nNTA\n\nAdopt ALL the black cats", "This is hilarious because she is from Alabama", "Ohhhh I love her.

But anytime we see a stray black cat we take them in because we've seen the horror stories of what people do to cats in general, let alone black ones. \nI've seen a black cat get thrown out of a moving car before. They sadly didn't make it.", "I would like cat-and-bun tax please", "This sounds like a win-win. You have a black cat and no weird person visiting.", "[removed]", "NTA, I wish to say that woman should seek mental help.\n\n\nThat's not how Spirit animals work. She allowed her cat to suffer and the whole I gave birth to it is very off to me. The only thing I can think of is she may have fertility issues. Even still you don't let an animal suffer like that. \n\nAlso props to adopting a little black kitty, they bring nothing but good luck and screams for treats", "Thank you for adopting a black cat. In the US some people think black cats are unlucky and are adopted in lower numbers then cats of other colors.", "NTA No one gets to dictate to you what animal to adopt (except local laws of course). Not every pet offered is a good fit and the friend should understand that. If they can\u2019t, that\u2019s really they\u2019re problem.\n\nI had a black cat, Smokey, for 17 years before having to put him down due to several strokes. Best cat I ever owned. Some people commented on the superstitions surrounding black cats but I dismissed them.", "NTA and the other cat 'identifies as black' wth is that shit?
