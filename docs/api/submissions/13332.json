First, Im so sorry you're going through this. I totally understand the guilt though. \n\nBut I don't think you were wrong in leaving when someone made you feel unsafe. I had a similar experience when my grandpa passed. I had an exam that day and I told him I'd meet him after that. But he passed away before I could. This was in 2001.

I think she really loved you, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what she would have wanted too.", "NTA - what matters is that you did spend time with her and she knew you loved her. She probably also knew that every good-bye might be the last one. \n\nPlease don't beat yourself up over this. The exact timing of a death can be unpredictable and we can't always be with our loved ones at that moment. It doesn't mean we love them any less.", "NTA at all", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly, if she was in the hospital for palliative care, she probably had a lot of medication and may not have been awake and alert enough to have seen you. She knew you loved her. There isn't a time clock on saying goodbye to a loved one. She's in your heart, don't let your memories of her be clouded by guilt. She wouldn't want that.", "Ahhhh what to say... Sad situation. I would feel very guilty if I was you as well. From one side you did well but from the other... I think you should have told her an excuse", "YTA for knowingly lying to her like that. C'mon.", "NTA.  This is your dad's fault as far as I can tell.", "NTA\n\nShe knew you were coming back. you didnt do anything wrong. your dad is an ass.", "NTA.  People leaving you alone with your father after being told not to are the assholes. I hope you never have contact with that man ever again.", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. Your grandmother would have wanted you to be safe.", "NTA", "I always try to think like, grandpa wanted me to succeed in my classes. It honored him to go to the exam.", "My grandpa died like 8 hours before I was supposed to go to his house and do some yardwork. I visited him pretty regularly, so I was sad it didn't happen but I never really felt like it was that big of a deal - I was there often and we both knew nothing is guaranteed. \n\nIt feels like a huge loss to not make it back one last time, but it's only a big deal if \"one last time\" was also \"one of the only times\" edit to add: and then it's your fault. \n\nIn op's case, they were there as much as they could be, and anyone who loves you wouldn't want you to be harmed for a few more minutes or hours.", "YTA-you are very selfish. Regardless of what your grandmother said, you could have stayed a few days for your grandmother who was dying, your father\u2019s insults weren\u2019t going to kill you. You lied to your grandmother. You will never know what it feels like to be sick and have people abandon you because of \u201ctheir own comfort\u201d or \u201cself care\u201d. You might get NTA on reddit but YTA in real life, for some reason it is viewed as ok to be exceedingly selfish for \u201cmental health\u201d reasons in today\u2019s society\n\nEdit: bring on the down votes, I don\u2019t care about Reddit karma", "NTA.\n\nYou have to prioritize your own safety in these situations - there's just never going to be a perfect science where everything works out the way you intend.\n\nI feel your pain when it comes to not feeling like you properly got to say goodbye though; my grandmother passed in 2014 and I still have regrets. She had broken her ankle after a nasty fall, as me being a young adult with no car had an arrangement worked out - I could borrow her car as long as I made myself free to drive her to and from her choir practices on weekends. The last time I took her to and from, she asked if I wanted to go get lunch with her and it eats me up inside that I said no because I had plans with my at the time GF. We both said \"Next weekend for sure!\"\n\nThen a blood clot caused her to go into cardiac arrest in the middle of the week and within a few hours she was gone. I wish I could go back and have that one last lunch with her.", "NTA and please be gentle with yourself.  Your grandmother loved you and she understands", "This!  OP, your grandmother would have wanted you to be safe.  NTA and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "When my father died (1983) my younger sister was at college. We all didn\u2019t want her to see the end. It was bad. She still resents us for not making sure she was there. I understand and a part of me wishes I wasn\u2019t there. We all have our burdens. I understand the guilt and it took me a loooong time to realize that he knew I loved him and that we would be okay. \nPeace and blessings to you", "oh my love, you were totally fine. telling her you\u2019d be back was a kindness. you\u2019re processing a lot of deeply upsetting things right now. go easy on yourself! hold on to: you dropped everything to spend time with your grandmother which showed her so clearly that you loved her and cared deeply about sharing this last moment in her life. she knew you cared about being with her and she left knowing she had people who loved her because you showed her that. no matter how perfectly you meet your own expectations about sending off a loved one you will be sad about it. the sadness doesn\u2019t mean anything about you except that you cared about the person you lost.\n\nnta.", "NTA, but maybe your dad was being an ass because he was losing his mother and was having a hard time processing it and talking about it as guys are told to man the fuck up and have a hard time dealing with things because we have to do it alone. Then again maybe he is just an a-hole.", "This. Big hugs! I\u2019m sorry your dad did that to you OP"]}
