When I heard the news, I dropped everything and went over to her place, where my aunt and my father were as well. I was a minor during this and my mothers rules were, one: don\u2019t leave me alone with my father (she let my aunt know). two: if I don\u2019t feel safe, contact her and she will come pick me up.\n\nLater that evening, the ambulance came and picked her up to bring her to the hospital to monitor her, my aunt goes with my grandmother. Leaving me, alone with my father. And at first, it wasn\u2019t bad, not at all. Everything was fine, until 5 days in and it\u2019s a Friday. My friend and I were in a fight, and I was finishing up a text before I helped my father with cooking dinner. As I was about to finish the message, he started screaming at me. Verbally abusing me, and so I ran to my room crying and called my mother. When my father was told I was leaving, he was furious and threw harsh comments at me. \n\nLater that night, before i left, we went to the hospital to visit my grandmother. When it was time to go, she kissed me goodnight, that she loved me dearly and said see you tomorrow. I told her, see you tomorrow as a response knowing I wasn\u2019t going to be back the next day. But, I was going to be back on the monday, I just needed space from my father. \n\nOn the Monday, around an hour before I was heading back there, I get a call from my dad. She passed away, and the last thing I told her was that i\u2019d be back, and then i never saw her again. I\u2019ve been stuck with this guilt.

First, Im so sorry you're going through this. I totally understand the guilt though. \n\nBut I don't think you were wrong in leaving when someone made you feel unsafe. I had a similar experience when my grandpa passed. I had an exam that day and I told him I'd meet him after that. But he passed away before I could. This was in 2001. I still regret it to this day. \n\nThe pain is real, but NTA.", "NTA.  You did what you had to protect yourself.  I think she really loved you, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what she would have wanted too.", "NTA - what matters is that you did spend time with her and she knew you loved her. She probably also knew that every good-bye might be the last one. \n\nPlease don't beat yourself up over this. The exact timing of a death can be unpredictable and we can't always be with our loved ones at that moment. It doesn't mean we love them any less.", "NTA at all", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly, if she was in the hospital for palliative care, she probably had a lot of medication and may not have been awake and alert enough to have seen you. She knew you loved her. There isn't a time clock on saying goodbye to a loved one. She's in your heart, don't let your memories of her be clouded by guilt. She wouldn't want that.", "Ahhhh what to say... Sad situation. I would feel very guilty if I was you as well. From one side you did well but from the other... I think you should have told her an excuse", "YTA for knowingly lying to her like that. C'mon.", "NTA.  This is your dad's fault as far as I can tell.", "NTA\n\nShe knew you were coming back. you didnt do anything wrong. your dad is an ass.", "NTA.  People leaving you alone with your father after being told not to are the assholes. I hope you never have contact with that man ever again.", "NTA. Sorry for your loss.

It honored him to go to the exam.", "My grandpa died like 8 hours before I was supposed to go to his house and do some yardwork. I visited him pretty regularly, so I was sad it didn't happen but I never really felt like it was that big of a deal - I was there often and we both knew nothing is guaranteed. \n\nIt feels like a huge loss to not make it back one last time, but it's only a big deal if \"one last time\" was also \"one of the only times\" edit to add: and then it's your fault. \n\nIn op's case, they were there as much as they could be, and anyone who loves you wouldn't want you to be harmed for a few more minutes or hours."]}
