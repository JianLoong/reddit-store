She found her dream dress, but it was way out of her budget. Knowing I\u2019ve saved a bit, she asked if I could pay for it as her wedding gift. I agreed because I wanted her to be happy.\n\nHowever, a few days ago, we had a family gathering where she introduced her fianc\u00e9 to our extended family. During the dinner, she made a snide remark about my career, implying that I was still \u2018playing with my computer\u2019 while others had real jobs.\n\nI was hurt and confronted her later. Things escalated, and I told her that if she didn\u2019t respect my career, she shouldn\u2019t expect me to fund her wedding dress with the money I earned from it.

Imagine for a moment that you're entitled enough to ask someone to fund an expensive frivolity you can't afford in one breath, and then insult the means by which they would fund it in the next? No, a wedding dress isn't frivolous, but an unaffordable one is. What kind of message would you be sending if you paid for something after she treated you like that?

No apology will even be genuine at this point.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "NTA\n\nIt would be a lovely gesture to pay for her dress, but it's not your responsibility.  It would be the type of generous gesture reserved for people who treat you with respect.\n\nI would probably ask your sister something along the lines of, \"Do you really want your wedding dress paid for with the money form my illegitimate career?  It would be a permanent emotional stain on your dress, and I wouldn't want you to regret that down the line.\"\n\nShe's not cool with what you do but wants the money you make doing it.  I think she'd do well to live within her her means and not to bite the hand that feeds her.\n\nETA: She ruined her own wedding, and you had nothing to do with it.  First by thinking a dress can ruin a wedding (celebrating a union with her life partner who she loves should be the focus), and Second by the aforementioned snobbery/greed.\n\nEdit 2: I feel the need to point out OP is a woman (28F) because people are misgendering her in the reply chain to this post.", "NTA\n\nDo not insult the person who will help you financially.

My sister (25F), on the other hand, has always been critical of my job, calling it a \u2018hobby\u2019 and not a \u2018real job\u2019.\n\nOur parents passed away a few years ago, and I\u2019ve been more of a parental figure to her since then. We\u2019ve had our ups and downs, but I\u2019ve always tried to support her.\n\nRecently, she got engaged and was over the moon about planning her wedding. She found her dream dress, but it was way out of her budget. Knowing I\u2019ve saved a bit, she asked if I could pay for it as her wedding gift. I agreed because I wanted her to be happy.\n\nHowever, a few days ago, we had a family gathering where she introduced her fianc\u00e9 to our extended family. During the dinner, she made a snide remark about my career, implying that I was still \u2018playing with my computer\u2019 while others had real jobs.\n\nI was hurt and confronted her later. Things escalated, and I told her that if she didn\u2019t respect my career, she shouldn\u2019t expect me to fund her wedding dress with the money I earned from it. She accused me of ruining her wedding and being petty.\n\nI\u2019m torn. I want to support her, but I also feel disrespected. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Nope, you're not an asshole. Your sister is though.", "NTA. The person who ruined her wedding, if it\u2019s ruined, is her. Not only did she decide on a dress that was way out of her budget, she is pinning her idea of a perfect wedding on a stupid, overpriced dress. \n\nI have a friend who wore Vera Wang for her wedding. I thought she was nuts. But she was already a successful attorney, and paid for it herself. At 25, it\u2019s unreasonable to expect anyone else to pay for your wedding. When you are so disrespectful of the person who generously offered to buy that overpriced dress, you have no business wearing it. \n\nI\u2019m going to be blunt, here, OP. You are a mere 3 years older than your sister. You lost your parents, just as she did. But you two are too close in age for her to treat you like a substitute parent. And even more so, when she so clearly feels superior to you. \n\nYou just drew a completely reasonable boundary with her. Was this the first time that you let her know that her disrespect will not be tolerated? If so, it was overdue. But necessary. And however you got there, you got there. She is getting married. She 100% needs to know that entails, among other things, being grateful to the people who have supported her throughout her childhood and adolescence, and to treat them, her fellow adults, with respect. \n\nMy wish for you is that your sister does some rapid growing up, and realizes that she needs your respect as much as you need hers. She\u2019s not been acting very respectable, and needs to start.", "NTA, what a horrible way to treat you. Why are people like this? You don't owe her an expensive dress.

What's the saying \"Don't bite the hand that feeds you\"? It might be jealousy on her part or whatever but if she wanted that dress she should've acted like it. I sorta feel like an asshole for sounding like she should've been fake till she got the dress but that's not my point. its just called being a decent person. If a person is willing to pay your way or in this case buy an expensive gift you might want to appreciate it enough to keep your mouth shut if you cant say anything nice or don't accept the gift.", "NTA - play stupid games, win stupid prices. Your sister is a disrespectful, entitled little brat and 20 years too old to have an excuse for that.\n\nThat said, this wedding is probably important for her and despite statistics saying the opposite, most people consider it a once-in-a-lifetime thing. You might want to find a more measured response. What she did was shitty. Your response is a bit harsh, like throwing a nuke on a small border dispute.\n\nShe definitely needs to learn some respect. But offer her a way out. Maybe after cooling down tell her that you'll stand by your promise, because it's a promise after all, but you expect that she doesn't forget again that your job, whatever she thinks of it, paid for that.", "God what a tool.

She doesn't deserve her \"dream dress.\" She can find something within her own budget. Beggars have no room to be snarky and ungrateful. OP, take the dress money and put it in a CD that you can't touch for like 5 years... The dress money will no longer be accessible and you should earn some nice interest from it. If sister can't be respectful of you, she doesn't need anything that your \"hobby\" brings to the table. She \"ruined\" her own wedding because she is a brat. I guess she better start pinching pennies or go with something that is more reasonable.

She just sounds jealous and bitter of your career!", "NTA\n\nWhy do you keep supporting her she is an adult let her husband pay for it. None of it is your responsibility", "I don\u2019t think she respects you or what your job is.. especially when you offered to pay for her dress and *then she insults you after? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH", "YTA,                                                                    \n\nGet over yourself, you promised to pay for the dress so pony up.\n\nBeing disrespected sucks, but one thing has nothing to do with the other", "I would pay for the wedding dress. I would also tell her that if she ever disrespects you or your job again that offer, and any future offers of help are withdrawn. \n\nSometimes people make remarks and are not consciously meaning to cause hurt, they are just unthinking. I would give her the benefit of the doubt on this occasion but not again.", "ESH. \n\nYour sister is being an asshole about your job. It's probably coming from a place of insecurity, but that doesn't make it OK and she needs to knock that shit off.\n\nYou're also being an asshole because if you say you're going to pay for someone's wedding dress you don't rescind the offer over a tiff this minor.\n\nHonestly it sounds like you're both being pretty immature and petty. Have a meaningful conversation about how her dismissal of your career hurts your feelings; don't hold a gift over her head.", "ESH.  I mean, she's obviously awful, but she seems consistently awful.  You decided to be a decent caring sister and do something nice for her, but it turns out she's the same as she's always been.  It's like now you have something to take back from her and you're using that leverage, but it doesn't feel to me like those things should be connected.  You knew how she was when you offered to buy the dress; did you think an extremely kind gesture would change her?  Of course she'd end up doing something mean in the time before the wedding. I'm not sure this was the right penalty for that.\n\nAs far as ruining her wedding, you're not. You're just taking back the money you said you'd give as a present.  She can find another way to pay for the dress.  \n\n\n(To clarify, ESH doesn't mean you're an AH, you're absolutely not.  I just think this maybe wasn't the best response to the situation, though it does sound pretty satisfying and is extremely justified.)", "YTA.  You made a promise and reneged over something small and predictable.", ">What kind of message would you be sending if you paid for something after she treated you like that?\n\nExactly: we teach others how to treat us, by allowing behaviors around us. This is an unacceptable behavior, regardless of the dress. But with the dress on offer, it becomes stupidly entitled.", "She didn't just insult OP, she did it by denigrating the job that sourced the money to buy her ungrateful butt a dress.  The dress is outside of her budget?  Time to re-budget.  Fortunately, if she uninvites OP to the wedding, no gift at all will be necessary.  Win-Win.\n\nAnd while I laud OP's loyalty to her family, at 25 that sister should have suitable savings of her own if her career is so on track.  Stop subsidizing her.  That's now her fianc\u00e9's burden, anyway.  She can always tell him why there's a change in plans thanks to her jealousy and rudeness.", "I don't understand why it needs to be future offers. If it was unthinking and not meant to be hurtful, then sister should apologize now. If she does, then I agree that for the sake of a family member OP genuinely seems to love, then they try to move on from this. But if sister doubles down, then I don't think OP is obligated to continue her unnecessary help in this situation either. A wedding dress is not a necessity.", "It's not sticky at all. If somebody is disrespectful or cruel to you, you don't owe them a wedding dress. It's not as if OP even offered to pay for something vital like medicine or a life-saving surgery - it's a *dress*. Nobody needs an expensive dress, and the sister can easily find another.", "It's unfortunately common. People disregard ones ability to support themselves over their idea of what a title means in society. There was a post a while back about a guy who was successful enough at his \"hobby\" (woodworking I believe) that he only worked part of the year and took the rest of the time off. His SIL made some comments at a family dinner about how if her kids didn't stay in school they would wind up like their uncle. She got a reality check when she was informed that unbeknownst to her he had paid her husband's entire way through college and was in the middle of building a huge house with his hobby money which is why he was presently living in a very modest home until it's completion.", "[deleted]", "Copy and paste, this OP. Wonderful wording to reply to the people criticizing you.", "I personally see it as more ethical to not reward somebody for doing shitty things, regardless of what I've said. My self worth is more important than upholding every single promise I've ever made, no matter what. Because yes, circumstances change. No agreement should be written in stone.", "I know. \n\nI'm wondering if there's some jealousy issues cuz OP is self-taught and didn't go the traditional route of schooling; hence, accusing OP's work as being a \"hobby\".\n\nSisters got tonnes of insecurity and jealousy issues.", "Some wordart Wingdings would def class up the invites", "always better to be lucky than good but here's the thing - you created your own luck because you are both smart enough to recognize the opportunity to show how great you are AND dedicated to the cause of exploiting that luck.\n\nEveryone gets luck from time to time.  Its identifying the opportunity that is a result of that luck and exploiting the luck in that sense that makes people great.\n\nBravo.", "If you let people insult you to your face over and over without standing up for yourself, you have no self-respect.", "Wedding rings typically sell for below melt value", "Yeah I found that out with some googling. Guess the entire wedding industry is just one big scam.....", "what old books say that? can you cite them?", "Our entire economic system is one big scam. Welcome to the left", "Jesus says turn the other cheek, Buddha says detach yourself from the situation (famously he advises you don't need the name of the archer to heal an arrow in the knee), Lao Tzu says stop whining and look around carefully with interest. Getting over yourself  is the whole point of the reincarnation cycles in those traditions.", "I once read a comment that changed my perspective on this, where someone explained that they feel about second-hand rings similarly to how they feel about re-homed animals. Like, it took the work of many hands to obtain the materials and to craft a beautiful ring, whatever happened wasn\u2019t the ring\u2019s fault and makes it no less worthy of being cherished", "I really wouldn't go this far. At all.", "The cool thing is I have told that story to a number of people who then did the same thing by hiring a jeweler and getting gold donations from family in lieu of gifts. Even gold-plated costume jewelry can be melted down and refined for the gold.", "I find it hilarious that the best answers are downvoted to oblivion, while the childish way to handle it are all at the top.", "She has a right to her opinion but shitty opinions have consequences.", "A right to your opinion does not mean you don't have consequences for your actions.", "agree.  Sister should show some respect.", "I\u2019m wondering if 25F was a typo and the sister is actually 95. How has she not noticed that a lot of people with successful careers these days spend their time sitting in front of a computer screen?", "You're not wrong.  But I had the money for it and I felt like a damn princess that day.  Zero regrets.  I'm in a messy bun and dirty scrubs most of the time, the dress was frivolous and amazing and worth every penny.", "So are weddings...", "This is your opening to teach him how to respect the person who supports him financially. NTA", "Student loans are a bitch\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s a great point, though!", "While I agree with your general sentiment, the college requirement is often there to filter for people who at least have been certified to be willing to put in the work for 4 years as opposed to being a giant question mark.\n\nThe reality is that managers don't have all day to figure that out and don't want to waste time in training someone who couldn't give a shit. It's easier to just slap on the college filter even if it's not a perfect measuring stick.", "Because the wedding-industrial complex has told them that the price of the ring is directly proportional to how much your fianc\u00e9 loves you. The fact that the ring is overpriced is a feature, it\u2019s not a problem to be solved.", "This is exactly how I would feel about it as well. Seems like bad juju to bring that into your marriage.", "Cite the actual books, the actual words. Because none of those sound like what you said. Also I guess we're just going to ignore that all of these old books come from very old times with very different morals? I'm not really interested in advice from people who were fine with slavery and women having no rights."]}
