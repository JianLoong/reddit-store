Yes, it feels crummy to be rude someone even in the correct circumstance.  This makes you a decent person to have these feelings.  You\u2019ve also taught her a lesson.", "NTA- she was way out of line and completely unprofessional.", "NTA, seems fair enough.", "NTA, it\u2019s literally not anyone\u2019s place to be judgmental to someone going through a pregnancy/labor. in fact, she should be doing the opposite and helping you feel comfortable. what she did was entirely unprofessional and unempathetic", "NTA. To be incredibly generous, she needs a lot of training. To be viscerally reactive, as someone who has one child because of an horrendous birthing experience, she needs kicking out of the profession.", "NTA\n\nYou were in labor - and a complicated labor at that!  She is the one who is supposed to remain composed and professional, not you.\n\nYou were absolutely right in what you said about her, and to have her removed from the room.", ">better to be cut on ur tummy than your vagina\n\nI wholeheartedly agree.

You were correct in saying that her job was not to judge, or comment, but to support you at this time. She needs to work on her bedside manner, because currently, it sucks.", "NTA. It\u2019s good that you and your partner were standing up for yourself.\nI\u2019m sorry this happened.

She seriously made my whole labour experience so much worse than what it already was.", "Me and my husband were so shocked by what we were hearing we didn\u2019t expect to hear her make the comments she did at all. She was in the room with me but provided no support only judgement and criticism. My husband was providing more physical and emotional support than she was. He was the one who escorted me to the bathroom everytime I needed to go whilst being hooked onto all the wires and monitor. He even went as far as helping me undress and into comfortable positions to help with pain relief. I honestly felt like he did so much more than she ever did.", "Exactly! I really didn\u2019t mind having a student in the room as I understand they need to be exposed to hands on work to learn how to do the job their working towards. But her comments were so out of line. The unit was so busy and she was left in the room with ur whilst the qualified and experienced midwives popped in and out. Once we had her removed we had to have 2 experiences midwives stay in the room permanently due to the circumstances of my labour complications."]}
