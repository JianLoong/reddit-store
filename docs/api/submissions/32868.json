That's nice and all, but they do *not* get a special cookie for it. They don't get to hold it over your head like this!

You use the word \"grateful\" far too much.\n\nIt's great that you appreciate the privileges you've experienced in life, there is a point where even gratitude becomes toxic.\n\nYou've worked hard and it sounds like you've leveraged the gifts your parents gave you really well.

A compromise is where two disagreeing parties meet somewhere in the middle. Your parents are walking all over you and your future spouse with extremely shitty arguments, and you\u2019re letting them!

It is actually MY wedding, and while I appreciate your thoughts, we are going to do what we feel is best for us.   I am not concerned about what others think, and if they don\u2019t like it then they know what not to do for their own wedding.  Plan the wedding of your dreams with your fianc\u00e9e, then stick to the plan.  This is YOUR wedding.   We had this issue when my son got married, he and his bride would make plans, her parents wouldn\u2019t like them and try to change her mind.   Every.  stinking. Day. She would end the day crying because her parents told her they didn\u2019t like what she and son planned and tried to force a change.  He was angry a lot, she was sad a lot.   I tried staying out of it.   Pointed out to the bride and groom that it is their wedding, they get to do things their way.   Until one day I snapped.   Looked her parents in the eye, said that this was bride and groom\u2019s wedding, the could do it anyway they wanted, that parents can offer opinion but it was very wrong and rude to tell them that their wants and desires were wrong or stupid.   I then dug the knife in a little deeper and said that since in was paying for the wedding then I was now putting my foot down and telling her parents to back off.    Yeah, that didn\u2019t go over well, but got the point across that neither I nor the parents of the bride were the ones getting married, therefore it was none of our business how things were done.   \n\nYou need to get out of your head how grateful you are for your parents.   No, don\u2019t go the opposite direction, but you are overly concerned. This is your wedding, what do you and fianc\u00e9e want?   That is the important thing.   You are a grown ass adult.  You can listen to your parent\u2019s thoughts, you do not have to do everything they want.   A wedding is just a few hours.  A marriage can last a lifetime.  Focus on what is important, your relationship with your spouse.   No wedding goes smoothly, there is always something someone wishes they had done differently, there is a meltdown (or three), don\u2019t focus on stuff.   And you know what?   If you only want 80 people at your wedding then cut back right now.   Tell mom and dad it is great that they want to invite everyone, but that is not what you want.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t change your thought process now, your mom and dad will be having all the say in your marriage and children . . . When to have them, where to deliver, where to live, what school they go to and yes, you as the mom should quit your job and be a stay-at-home mom.   Nothing wrong with the last one,but if that isn\u2019t what you want to do, then don\u2019t do it.  Maybe your husband wants to be the stay-at-home dad.", "NTA.

If you don\u2019t have the wedding you want because of your parents I guarantee you\u2019ll regret it later on", "Give the money back or say that since the budget is much higher than her contribution, her contribution already covered change in venue and guest list. That you have respected their contribution and since you are paying for everything else only your opinion matters.", "NTA give the 5k back. Tell them they are parents and don't get to hold over everything they did for you over your head just to get their way. It's not their wedding and you are no longer accepting their opinions and having your dream wedding with your partner. If they don't want to attend that's fine any family who agrees to how down to your parents will be blocked till after the wedding. It's ridiculous how parents really think their child owes them everything because they had unprotected sex.", "NTA, honestly I\u2019d give them back the money. The fact that they helped you pay for college doesn\u2019t entitle them to make all the decisions for your future. They chose to make those contributions. This is your life, your wedding to your fianc\u00e9 and it\u2019s time to stop caving to them. You need some firm boundaries, now before you really grow to resent them trying to control your life!", "NTA your mother had her wedding ask her about it, ask her was your wedding all planed by you act excited to hear about the whole day.

How did it make you feel?\n\n4) Don\u2019t you think since it is mine and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding, shouldn\u2019t we be able to do the way we want??\n\nYou need to nip this in the bud.

Destination weddings are selfish if they cause financial hardship to your guests.", "Nta. \n\nGive your mom the money back and tell her to go enjoy herself. \n\nYou are not obligated to bend over backwards for someone who was supposed to pay for your survival. \n\nAlso 5k is a very small fraction of 35k.

You've already changed the entirety of your wedding to suit her, there's a massive difference between an 80px destination wedding and a large formal more local wedding and she should be happy you've accommodated this much. If she pushes back, and you're in a position to, consider asking her to itemise a bill for what she paid for your housing and work out a payment plan, because bets are this will be held over your head every time she doesn't get her way. \n\nI would also consider sitting down with your fianc\u00e9 and deciding whether the compromises you've already made are what you really want for your wedding.
