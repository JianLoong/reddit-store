Looked her parents in the eye, said that this was bride and groom\u2019s wedding, the could do it anyway they wanted, that parents can offer opinion but it was very wrong and rude to tell them that their wants and desires were wrong or stupid.

You and partner.  Who is this party for?  You and partner. Who is paying the bulk of the wedding even with the \"gift\".

This is why people should cover the full costs of their wedding whenever possible.

I'm puzzled though how you can call 80 guests a small wedding. Do you really know 80 people well enough to want them there or is it more a question of inviting people because they happen to be related?", "If you don't put your foot down with your parents now they will try to take over your entire married life. Who's wedding is this anyway???", "NTA - You can pay your parents back for their help, then decide everything for yourself.  If they don't like it, it will because they are projecting their desires for themselves on you, and not letting you have the wedding you want.  If you want to invite guests who can't afford to make it to your wedding, why not subsidize their trips?    \n\n\nDon't let the parents dictate to you what marriage means.  Rigid formality will destroy things, as real life depends on being flexible in many situations, such as this one.  They are not flexible.  So, stand your ground, or you will lose respect for yourself.", "You need to learn to stand up for yourself. No is a full sentence. \n\nStop involving her in planning and have the destination wedding that you want. Who cares if it's a hassle for others to attend?

This is a seperate occasion and it is my wedding. I am trying to be generous in compromising to your vision, BUT in the end the ultimate decisions are made by my Fiance and I.

I suggest you start now. This is going to happen every holiday (whose parents do you go to visit, how do you divide your time, what about your need for a Christmas morning at home or a mother's day just for you). \n\nI might consider an elopement/destination wedding with maybe just a few friends attending. Pay for the entire groups travel and stay and just enjoy your time together with your new husband and friends.

Even if she paid the whole the whole bill, the wedding should still be what you and your fiance want.\n\n Reiterate that you and your fiance want something more casual than what she wants. Tell her neither of you will be happy if she turns it into a formal dinner wedding. As this is the first, and biggest, party you will plan with your fiance, you want to be sure all your wants are represented at the casual garden wedding. \n\nHelping you with college was a great thing. But most parents try to help with college. You should not feel guilty for accepting this money. \n\nRemind her she planned her own wedding, and let her know you want to plan yours with your wife. Remind her you're able to pay for this, and plan it on your own. You would like her input, but you would like her input on a more casual garden wedding. Let her know if all she can say is that your ideas are wrong, she isn't helping you.\n\nNta!", "NTA \n\nBut do you realize you aren't \"making compromises\" but just letting your mom get her way? And that's why you have this problem - because she's used to running right over you??? \n\nThe \"yeah, well, we would be paying for this if we didn't pay for college so let me fo what I want\" is totally, absolutely, utterly crazy. If you don't stop this now, she's gonna use this for everything in your life. \n\nAnd lots of parents pay for kids' college.

Give back the $5k and tell your mum that she can use it towards her next formal, traditional wedding.", "NTA, I doubt the $5,000 they gave would go very far towards the wedding your mother is demanding.

If your mother has used the fact that she paid for your college apartment in the past - or if you think she will in the future - you might want to consider repaying her if at all possible.

The bride isn't more important. \n\n\nA destination wedding definitely causes more declines, especially if people can't afford it/can't take time off.
