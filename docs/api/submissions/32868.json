It was a major deal for my family as I was the first and only sibling to go to college. \nIt was mostly paid for by the university, but not all of it. \nMy parents very graciously paid for my housing and a bit of my tuition, which was expensive since it was a city campus. \nIt was so generous of them and I am very privileged to be able to say that. \nThat being said, I also worked very hard (60 hours a week) in the summer in order to pay for all my living expenses since I could not work while also playing this sport. \nAfter I graduated, I got a well paying job and got a promotion not long after getting engaged where I now make 250k a year. \nIt is such a privilege and a blessing to be able to say that I\u2019ve saved up a lot for this wedding and worked really hard to be able to afford what my fianc\u00e9 and I want. \nWe are really excited to get married!! \n\nFlash forward to now, we are in the thick of wedding planning. Our budget is 35k\nMy parents very very generously gave us 5000 dollars for the wedding. \nI didn\u2019t expect them to give us anything and I couldn\u2019t be more thankful for their contribution. I know they are extremely excited about this wedding too. I am the first child, grandchild, cousin etc to get married in my extended family and so is my fianc\u00e9. \nSince day one though, my mom has had some pretty extreme opinions about the wedding. \nI\u2019ve obliged to most of them and compromised. \nFor example, I wanted an outdoor garden style reception that felt more like a day time dinner party. My mom said that it wasn\u2019t formal enough. \nMy fianc\u00e9 and I wanted a very small wedding of about 80 people and no kids. \nMy mom and dad said that they absolutely wanted all their family members there. \nWe wanted to have a destination wedding, but my parents said that was too much of a hassle for everyone and a big burden to put on our family \n\nNow, I don\u2019t mind making compromises. I love them and I\u2019m grateful for them. I understand how much privilege and blessing I have in my life that I have parents that have supported me. \nBut my mom broke my spirit today when she said that my invitation choice was too casual and that it\u2019s disrespectful to the spiritual and sacred point of marriage \nAnd it\u2019s completely disrespectful of their contribution to the wedding. \nI mentioned to her that the theme is informal, elegant dinner party \nAnd she said, \u201cOK well the vibe should just be beautiful elegant traditional. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do because tradition and etiquette is that. It is us, your parents, that are inviting friends and family to the marriage of their daughter since it\u2019s our family that is spending the money and hosting. Also the money may be coming from your account now, but we would have paid for the whole wedding if we hadn\u2019t paid for your apartment in college\u201d \nI don\u2019t really know what to say to that. \nThis felt like the last straw. I know it\u2019s just the invites but it\u2019s all added up! \nHELP!", "created_utc": 1702355741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gdoia/aita_for_not_wanting_my_mom_to_have_the_final_say/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is your wedding.

If you only want 80 people, only invite 80 people.  If you want an outdoor reception, rent the venue and invite to the outside reception.

It's *your* wedding, not hers. You're an adult now. And for her to hold your college housing over your head is manipulation by guilt.

If parents helped you in college, it does not mean they bought you and your life forever :) It was their adult choice: to give money or not. On what terms etc. Selling your soul and your own life to them was not in the terms I guess :)\n\nI'd cut off all the family from any decision-making. It's your wedding, you organize it with YOUR family (fiancee) so that YOU TWO remembered that you made the wedding of your dreams. and you invite everyone you two feel like inviting to this wedding: be it 5 people or 555. \n\nYour mom seems to be organizing her own wedding. Well, she can do it for her money, in her place, in her time - say, to renew the vows :) And do it as formal, as white, blue or black as she wants to.

Your mother doesn't get to decide everything just because she made a contribution. She is not going to like to have her wishes thwarted though.

OP says she appreciates everything her parents did - and that's great, no doubt she's sincere about that. But the fact of the matter is OP's mother is being grossly manipulative and is blatantly interfering in something that is not hers.\n\nIt's in no way unusual for parents to help their kids through college, and that doesn't give them any rights over how their kids get married.\n\nI enjoyed free tuition at university because one of my parents was an employee - the value of that was massive. They also covered the rest of my expenses. I obviously appreciated the heck out of that. They didn't interfere in the slightest in either my wedding or that of my sibling. It would never have occurred to them.", "Honestly this whole thing has caught me off guard! \nShe\u2019s always been opinionated but she\u2019s never thrown this back in my face before. She knows how hard I work at my job and how grateful I am to them for everything they\u2019ve helped me with along the way, so this was particularly insulting to me", "Then tell her that. Ask her if she helped you only so she could throw it back in your face, or control you. You need to set boundaries right now, or this will happen over and over anytime she feels like she knows better than you how you should live your life."]}
