{"id": 13964, "submission_id": "12bavhc", "title": "AITA for calling out my sister's lie and causing a fight over leggings?", "selftext": "During a recent visit to my family home, I (26F) noticed that my younger sister (25F) was wearing a pair of leggings that looked exactly like the ones I had lost a year ago. When I asked her if they were mine, she quickly denied it. However, I had loved those leggings so much that I had bought 2 pairs of the same ones ~2 years ago and left 1 spare at home to use later once the old pair was done for. Last year when I went home, I looked for the leggings everywhere, asked everyone in the house if they'd seen it, and made a big production of losing it, but finally couldn't find them, so I assumed they were lost in the move.\n\nAs my sister continued to deny that the leggings belonged to me, I became suspicious. I knew that this particular design had been discontinued and was no longer available in stores because I tried to repurchase them after \"losing\" them. When I pressed her further and asked when she bought them, she said she purchased them a few months ago, which I knew was not possible. I showed her my old pair, which I coincidentally wore on this trip, and it was identical in size and design to the one she was wearing. My sister is 6 inches taller than me, so we never buy the same size. Finally, my sister switched her argument and said that because I had left them in our shared childhood bedroom and not claimed them for the last year, I couldn't just come back and demand them back as I pleased. She continued to become very defensive and started insulting me, calling me an instigator, selfish, and problematic. She even used vulgar language, calling me a \"fucking bitch\" in front of the rest of our family.\n\nSurprisingly, my parents took my sister's side and criticized me for being selfish. They suggested that I should be less possessive of my clothes and that it was okay for my younger sister to \"borrow\" them. When I explained that the issue wasn't about borrowing, but rather the fact that my sister took it and repeatedly lied to me, they still took her side and accused me of being unreasonable.\n\nThis incident made me reflect on the ongoing favoritism in my family, which has been an issue for me for a long time. I feel like my parents often gaslight me and make me feel like I'm the problem. They even suggested that my stressful job was causing me to have \"meltdowns\" and that I should quit and move back home.\n\nI finally reached a breaking point and told my family that if they don't change the way they treat me, I don't want to continue having a close relationship with them. This only made things worse, and my family labeled me as the problem yet again.\n\nAlthough the issue may seem trivial on its own, there are deeper underlying problems in my family dynamic, and this incident with the leggings was just the tipping point. I feel so strongly about this that I'm baffled that no one else feels that way. So am I the asshole for causing this big fight?", "created_utc": 1680589480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bavhc/aita_for_calling_out_my_sisters_lie_and_causing_a/", "score": 343, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s the principle of the thing here and not just about a pair of leggings. She lied to you and made it your fault that she stole from you. She knew they were yours and didn\u2019t give a damn at her age. I\u2019d understand if she were a teenager who didn\u2019t know the value of items, but really?\n\nBut anyways, it does sound like there is favoritism here and I get why you\u2019re hurt. I\u2019m sorry your family are assholes.\n\nAlso you didn\u2019t start a big fight. You confronted her and she was the one who flipped out.", "NTA \nYour sister is a thief, and your parents are enabling her.\nI'd go low contact with them.", "NTA. Switching stories halfway through is blatant lying and regardless of the object that's just wrong. On top of that it's really messed up that it got turned around on you. I am an older sibling, and feel like there's favoritism towards the younger child in a lot of families. It's infuriating and hurtful and really builds resentment over time. Sorry op", "NTA - steal their TV and sell it - if caught tell them to share", "NTA- however, while your sister should've just had the guts to be honest and own up to it, it sucks that this had to be your last straw.\n\n\nAs you stated, there's so much more to it than this singular incident, and I'm sure you're thinking, \"Really?  Pants are the straw that broke the camel's back?\",  but if it wasn't this, it would've been something else.\n\n\nI suggest you write a letter so you can collect your thoughts in a more concise way.  Whether you choose to share the letter with your family or not is up to you.", "NTA\n\nYou acknowledged this is a symptom, not an illness. Sometimes a feather can break a camel's back and no one would blame the feather...", "NTA.\n\nI 30f have a sister 33f. When I was staying at our dad's place (Mum & Dad divorced when I was 8). \nSister would go into my room and take my stuff. When I got back multiple times. She had my bags, leggings, shirts, accessories all of it. I confronted her time and time again but she lied. Mum enabled it so much that I couldn't go near her room or \"her stuff\" otherwise I'd be yelled at as well as other bad treatment.\n\nAt the end of the day it is just stuff. The fact that they are making you out to be the problem and gassing you is the issue.\n\nMy solution was taking a hard look and walking away cutting contact last year. It's not worth the headache or pain. It hurts walking away but over time it does ease and less bs drama too. So peaceful now.", "NTA. She didn't borrow them: she stole them then repeatedly lied about it. When she could no longer maintain the lie, she resorted to insults and tried to blame you.\n\nYour family's response explains why she feels that it's alright to behave in this way. This isn't about the leggings: it's about how you dared to challenge the golden child. She can lie, she can steal and she can be verbally abusive and insulting, but you're not allowed to say anything.", "NTA OP, she started the fight by not being honest in the first place & you only exposed her in the process.", "NTA, she's a thief and a liar, and your family are assholes for turning that against you.\n\nI'd consider going no contact if it is indeed a regular thing.", "YTA - you\u2019re 26 and made a big deal out of *leggings*. \n\nYou may have bigger issues with the dynamic in your family that need to be addressed. But I guarantee you - trying to get your family to take those issues seriously by causing beef over a pair of pants, it\u2019s not going to get you what you\u2019re looking for.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister lied to you. Your family chose her side even when she admitted to taking them and lying about it. They are gaslighting you by claiming you're the one at fault here. It sounds like this behaviour is not new from them. I'm not telling you to disown your family.\n\nHowever, I will ask you why you're tolerating their abusive behaviour? I don't know if they will change, but I do know that there's no way they will until you put your foot down.\n\nYou need to talk to your family and explain why their behaviour is wrong and if they want you to be a part of their life, it has to change.", "From now on refer to her as 'Liarthief', in every interaction with everyone. Don't emphasise the name, just say it like it roles off the tongue.\nTo your friends, parents, family and mutual acquaintances.\nYou will ultimately be called out by your sister and parents, but stand you ground and insist that until she apologises she is indeed a liar and a thief.\nMy cousin did this to her brother for 4 years until he finally broke down after we all started calling him it.\n'Bob' is a much better person nowadays because of it.", "NTA\nYour sister is a thief.", "NTA\n\n1) Wait for them to end up in the washing \n\n2) take them from the washing\n\n3) escape with your fav tights and block. Bonus points if your scape with a favourite piece of her clothing.", "NTA. My sister pulled that shit as kids; she wore my top but mom put it in her bedroom, as though she had no idea at 15 that it wasn't hers. She popped zippers on clothes that were mine and 2 sizes too small for her.\n\nI would go NC.\n\nDON'T MOVE HOME!", "NTA and the fact that you\u2019re even questioning it tells me that reducing contact will be a good idea. Your family has lead you to feel that standing up for yourself is selfish and wrong. They have twisted and distorted your perception of reality so much that you\u2019re doubting whether speaking up against thievery and lying was the right call. Imagine teaching your child that they should let others use, steal, and lie, otherwise *they\u2019re* the problem? \n\nAnd by the way, *you* did not cause a fight. Your parents and sister chose to fight with you after being called out about their behaviour. That was *their* choice, not yours. You simply asserted that you don\u2019t like being stolen from and lied to\u2026 which is a perfectly normal and healthy boundary to set. \n\nFinally, if you\u2019re not already in it, I\u2019d like to suggest therapy - not because you\u2019re the problem but because you\u2019ll likely need help learning to set and stick to boundaries. I\u2019m a psychologist who works with a lot of interpersonal trauma and my clients often have difficulty recognizing what appropriate boundaries are. They also have trouble sticking to their boundaries because years of poor treatment lead them to become guilt-ridden whenever they stand up for themselves. So one thing I always remind them of - just because they *feel* something, doesn\u2019t make it true. Just because they feel guilty, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve done anything wrong. So that little voice in your head telling you that you\u2019ve caused a fight? Tell it to fuck right off - that\u2019s your parents\u2019 voice, not yours, and they really aren\u2019t worth listening to", "NTA you're the scapegoat and there is nothing you can do about that apart from cut ties. However, what usually happens is they then switch to another victim to replace you. When their new person wont lie down and take it there is usually a realisation of what you went through by their new victim and maybe some others, or their new victim demands you return to the fold to take the bashing once more.", "NTA", "Sometimes I feel crazy and I think it's all in my head because of the way they'll spin things to make it my fault that I just need to check with a neutral third party to believe it myself", "Yeah, she's a liar and a thief, and the parents condone lying to and stealing from OP.\nThat's going to create trust issues.", "The eldest boy was the golden child in my family, and me the girl much younger was the scapegoat. I passed my exams with high grades and told I was stupid, he failed all his and told he was clever. You just cannot win. Everything is always wrong.", "Sadly this became the last straw because of how black-and-white the issue was. It was pretty straightforward wrongdoing - you stole some thing, then you lied about it, got mad about and there were still no consequences. In my head it's like even when you're so clearly wrong you're still not held responsible, like if not now then when? All of that together just made all the issues feel so stark and in my face that something snapped at me.", "We're always told that family is everything and I don't question that for a second -  family is one of the most important things in life. But it is a hard realization to come to terms with that they're not perfect and sometimes getting away from these people who have been in your life from the very start is the best thing you can do for yourself. I'm starting to digest that slowly", "Did you read the post? She didn\u2019t cause beef. She asked her sister about it and in return was insulted, lied to, and gaslighted.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about leggings. It\u2019s about the asshole entitlement of her sister to steal, lie, and then get angry when she\u2019s caught on it. Added along with her parents making it worse by enabling it.", "Does it matter what it\u2019s over? Her sister lied to her face and her family took her side. THAT is a problem.", "leggings or not whats a big deal to her might not be one to you still doesn't give her sister the right to lie for over a year about taking her stuff", "Gaslighting you basically.\n\nYou\u2019re not crazy. You\u2019re allowed to not want people to steal from you, lie about it, and then get mad at you for it. It doesn\u2019t make you selfish. You paid for that item, owned it, and she knew you had lost it.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate but getting some distance from your family may be good for your mental health.", "NTA she's the \"golden child\" you are the \"scapegoat\". Look it up, it's a well known dynamic.", "Absolutely.  It was textbook gaslighting behavior.   And so many people use that term incorrectly, but this here was spot on.  She first tried to make you feel crazy or second guess yourself by flat out denial and fabrication, then made you feel like a villain when she was exposed for her lies.  \n\n\nIt's so easy to just tell the truth about something so trivial, yet she refused to just be real.  That's a huge red flag and probably just the tip of an iceberg.\n\n\nYou are not crazy.", "r/EstrangedAdultKids might be of interest to you", "Absolutely. The sad reality is that most of us don't have the fairy tale family. \nWhat helped me was watching Dr Ramani about scapegoating, narcissists. I'm not saying they are but understanding the pattern of behaviours and why they do what they do has helped me come to terms that sadly some people will not change and you cannot make them see because in their world they did no wrong. It's always the other person.", "Yep. I did. \n\nI actually read it a couple of times, just to make sure I read it right.", "I do think it matters what it\u2019s about, not to me - I don\u2019t care - but to her family. \n\nOP posited the question as to why her family doesn\u2019t feel as strongly about this as she does.\n\nPicture it. You have two children.  Grown women in their mid to late 20s. Everyone is home, and all the sudden, a fight breaks out. The topic? A pair of pants. The *grown* women expect their parents to referee, to take sides about\u2026pants.\n\nI do not disagree that there\u2019s a messed up family dynamic here, but that\u2019s not what I was asked to render judgment on.", "I don\u2019t disagree.\n\nI wasn\u2019t asked to render judgment over is her sister an AH for stealing her pants.", "That was really well put, she not only lied about it, but then got mad at me for it?  that basically summarizes all the constant gaslighting in our house", "YES THIS! It was the denial, fabrication and then I became the villain because I brought up the issue? Talking here I see it so clearly but when everyone around you looks at you like you have the problem and you're over reacting, you just take a step back and think am I in the wrong here?
