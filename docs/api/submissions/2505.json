I don\u2019t know what to think anymore.\n\nLong story short, the dad I grew up with is not my biological father.  My mom hooked up while he was deployed and I\u2019m the result, but the timing was close enough that nobody figured it out until I was a teenager. My younger brother had some medical issues the involved me being genetically tested to see if I was a match and it was really suspicious that I wasn\u2019t at all, so it turned into a Thing.  All hell broke loose.  My parents ended up staying together but my dad always treated me really coldly and his family stopped treating me as family at all which made me feel crappy.  He let me stay until I graduated high school and then told me to get out.  My mom was upset but not at all helpful, she basically stopped talking to me after that except checking in  every six months or so.  I did manage to get the name of the guy she cheated with out of her, though, and I was able to find him last year.  I figured the worst that could happen was that he told me to get lost like everyone else so why not?\n\nIt turns out my bio dad is a pretty cool guy.  He didn\u2019t know my mom was cheating or that she got pregnant.  We did the DNA test to be sure, but I\u2019m legit his kid and he seems to be really happy about that.  His wife has been really nice about it as well and they both told me that I\u2019m welcome to visit or talk anytime and if I want to be, I\u2019m family.  I\u2019ve even met some of his family and it\u2019s honestly been nice to feel wanted again.\n\nMy mom asked to talk a few days ago and I reluctantly agreed. My birth dad has had a change of heart and misses me. They want me to come back for Christmas this year to talk things over.\n\nI don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m doing okay without them and I can\u2019t forgive them for how they treated me. I told my mom that I\u2019m glad dad is feeling better, but that bridge can\u2019t be fixed right now. I\u2019m spending the holidays with bio dad and his family anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s turned into a big argument about forgiveness and understanding my dad was in shock and how I should be grateful he wants to reconnect.  A lot of people think I should go and work it out, but my bio dad treated me well when he didn\u2019t have to and I feel like he deserves my time more.", "created_utc": 1668640324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yx9fua/aita_for_ditching_my_birth_family_in_favor_of_my/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From what you\u2019re describing, he froze you out for *years*.  He chose to stay.  He chose to forgive your mom, who was actually the one who caused the problem.  If he couldn\u2019t keep his negative feelings from affecting *you*, he needed to take that to a therapist and bow out if he really couldn\u2019t get past it.

What your mom and her husband did to you is disgusting. They want something from you, even if just to be forgiven so they don't feel like crap about themselves, but you owe them nothing! If you do decide to talk to them, I recommend a neutral location with just them and no one else around to try to pressure you into forgiving them.", "His choices and his regrets are for him to live with. He punished you and disowned you for something you couldn't have possibly controlled. He hurt you, and he has to live with the results of the choices he made. I'm glad he's sorry, but sorry isn't a magic word to undo harm and trauma. (Also, this entire thing seems disingenuous if his reaction was \"you should be grateful\")   \n\n\nHe ditched you.

You owe them nothing not even gratitude that he wants to reconnect.", "NTA. You have a right to feel the way that you do. Your bio-dad took his hurt out on the wrong person. You didn\u2019t ask to be born. For your dad to be cold to you after he has raised you along with his family is astounding. Your mom should have stood up for you. You are an adult and you choose what you desire. Just because they are ready now to patch things up doesn\u2019t mean that it needs to be this holiday.

For sure. All I will add is, think of all of your life and what you want in your future, who you went to be part of that and how the actions of OTHER people may have sadly influenced any behavior that has hurt you, however wrong that may be X I think only you can know what is right here, it is a a tough one with no definitive right or wrong from an outsider\u2019s perspective.

Holidays are also loaded with emotional stuff, so the timing isn\u2019t great either. \n\nStand your ground about not getting together for the holidays. think it over. It\u2019s possible the dad who raised you was in shock and now understands he was an AH. Maybe slowly you can rebuild that bridge. But it should always be on your terms.", "NTA. Your birth family is full of toxic assholes, just stay away from them.

He had misplaced anger and hurt and I hope you two can grow back that bridge with time but it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019ll fix it. Your mom on the other hand disgusts me. She let this whole situation go on so long and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a big deal now I hope she\u2019s apologized a million times over to your poor father and will to you as well.", "NTA - first of all and a no brainer, go spend Christmas with your bio dad if that's what you really want to do. Seems to me he's been nothing but welcoming to you.\n\nSecondly, you have every right and reason to remain upset with your parents and even though their attempt at reconciliation is a good thing, they cannot    demand forgiveness on their terms.", "Oh my goodness, who in their right mind could ever think you're in the wrong? No, you are NTA.\n\nThe person you thought was your father was given quite the shock, and reasonable people can disagree as to how a person should react when he finds out the child he raised is not biologically his. \n\nIf your mother's husband is sorry, however, why hasn't he come to you himself? Why hasn't he written his letter of apology? Why hasn't he explained how he was wrong and what he intends to do to make amends? It's funny how the transgressor (often) expects the victim to (i) forgive and forget, or (ii) let it go (to keep the peace), or (iii) be the bigger person. Certainly, your mother has her own apology to make, and she's the true villain in the story. But she absolutely can't apologize for her husband.", "NTA, theres 0 chance the dads actually had a change of heart, the fact he thinks he\u2019s doing YOU a favour and you should be grateful is insanity. Saying he didn\u2019t have to treat you well makes it pretty clear he doesn\u2019t see you as family and when you disown someone you lose any relationship you built.", "Are you in the US?  Can you spend thanksgiving with one and Christmas with another?  \n\nNTA.  Maybe something like:\n\nI\u2019d love to connect again, but I have already made plans for Christmas.

Reddit clearly isn\u2019t. \nYou don\u2019t ever owe anyone forgiveness, especially not on their timeline. Especially not when they\u2019re a coward who got someone else to talk to you instead of apologizing to you directly. The way both your mom and birth dad treated you was terrible. \nAnd they definitely don\u2019t deserve your gratitude just for wanting to reconnect now. What you said to your mom was completely fair. Don\u2019t waste your energy entertaining their arguments. \n\nI hope you have an absolutely lovely holiday season with your bio dad!", "Nta, ( toxic ) birth family is right. On the head.\nYour bio father accepts  you as you are.\nIf or when you decide to have children you need a  stable support  system.
