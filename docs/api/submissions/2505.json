I don\u2019t know what to think anymore.\n\nLong story short, the dad I grew up with is not my biological father.  My mom hooked up while he was deployed and I\u2019m the result, but the timing was close enough that nobody figured it out until I was a teenager. My younger brother had some medical issues the involved me being genetically tested to see if I was a match and it was really suspicious that I wasn\u2019t at all, so it turned into a Thing.  All hell broke loose.  My parents ended up staying together but my dad always treated me really coldly and his family stopped treating me as family at all which made me feel crappy.  He let me stay until I graduated high school and then told me to get out.  My mom was upset but not at all helpful, she basically stopped talking to me after that except checking in  every six months or so.  I did manage to get the name of the guy she cheated with out of her, though, and I was able to find him last year.  I figured the worst that could happen was that he told me to get lost like everyone else so why not?\n\nIt turns out my bio dad is a pretty cool guy.  He didn\u2019t know my mom was cheating or that she got pregnant.  We did the DNA test to be sure, but I\u2019m legit his kid and he seems to be really happy about that.  His wife has been really nice about it as well and they both told me that I\u2019m welcome to visit or talk anytime and if I want to be, I\u2019m family.  I\u2019ve even met some of his family and it\u2019s honestly been nice to feel wanted again.\n\nMy mom asked to talk a few days ago and I reluctantly agreed. My birth dad has had a change of heart and misses me. They want me to come back for Christmas this year to talk things over.\n\nI don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m doing okay without them and I can\u2019t forgive them for how they treated me. I told my mom that I\u2019m glad dad is feeling better, but that bridge can\u2019t be fixed right now. I\u2019m spending the holidays with bio dad and his family anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s turned into a big argument about forgiveness and understanding my dad was in shock and how I should be grateful he wants to reconnect.  A lot of people think I should go and work it out, but my bio dad treated me well when he didn\u2019t have to and I feel like he deserves my time more.", "created_utc": 1668640324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yx9fua/aita_for_ditching_my_birth_family_in_favor_of_my/", "score": 192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He had misplaced anger and hurt and I hope you two can grow back that bridge with time but it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019ll fix it. Your mom on the other hand disgusts me.

No, you are NTA.\n\nThe person you thought was your father was given quite the shock, and reasonable people can disagree as to how a person should react when he finds out the child he raised is not biologically his. \n\nIf your mother's husband is sorry, however, why hasn't he come to you himself? Why hasn't he written his letter of apology? Why hasn't he explained how he was wrong and what he intends to do to make amends? It's funny how the transgressor (often) expects the victim to (i) forgive and forget, or (ii) let it go (to keep the peace), or (iii) be the bigger person. Certainly, your mother has her own apology to make, and she's the true villain in the story. But she absolutely can't apologize for her husband.", "NTA, theres 0 chance the dads actually had a change of heart, the fact he thinks he\u2019s doing YOU a favour and you should be grateful is insanity.

What I am saying is that he was hurting too; probably still is. Everyone thinks \"I'd love the child anyway,\" right up until it happens to them.

It's just something too keep in mind; I hope you can find peace with the situation, one way or another.\n\nAs to your biological father, I think it's wonderful that he and his family are being so welcoming, and if you want to explore and develop that connection, that's beautiful.\n\nTL;DR, I don't blame you for being upset. You have a right to be, and it's completely natural to want to explore that connection. I *do* think you should talk this out, if only for closure's sake, but it should be when you're ready, not before.

I\u2019m not saying your \u2018birthdad\u2019 is wrong for needing distance (although if he stayed with your mom I\u2019d argue part of that is remaining your dad) but you did nothing wrong. You didn\u2019t cheat. You played no active role in your conception. If he took it out on you rather than his wife, the one who actually hurt him, he\u2019s the one who needs to make it up to you, not the other way around. And shame on your mother for allowing her kid to be treated this way. Enjoy your chosen family, they seem to be more willing to stick by you than the people who raised you, which is sad.", "INFO: what is the timeline on finding out and current? How long did your initial parents freeze you out for?", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry, but where does your mother get off playing the middlewoman here when it was her escapades that started this whole mess? You suffered while she was only too happy to keep her head down and let you catch shit for her. You should be bringing this up at every opportunity, and reminding her of just how much of a fuckup she is, on the same level as your birth dad.", "NTA\nHowever, I will say if there is anything you want to express to them about the pain they caused you after finding out you should express that to them. I'm not saying give up ur Christmas but could be some other time.\n\nLet both of them know u paid the price for your mother's  mistake and their actions did not reflect that of a adult much less a parent. Say your piece but be the bigger person and leave if it's getting petty. It's your choice if you want to forgive but in my opinion you should definitely  make sure to build on to your relationship with your bio dad.", ">I should be grateful he wants to reconnect.\n\nThis really sealed it. NTA.\n\nI can understand them being hurt OP doesn\u2019t want to reconnect. What \u201cBirth Dad\u201d experienced is pretty awful and he wrongly chose to take that out on OP for years. It\u2019s good that he now understands he was wrong to do so but OP doesn\u2019t owe him anything and implying he does shows he hasn\u2019t really learned from his mistakes.", "What did you do when you found out your child was t yours ?", "Non bio dad. Bio dad is a nice person", "If you think the right course of action is to take out your anger on the child instead of on the cheating and lying spouse then you need to take a step back.", "Don't go back to them. Unlike parents in this subreddit my mom and dad are caring and patient. If they ever poisoned my brother against me without a valid reason that's a point of no return. How old 's  your brother btw?", "I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, however I\u2019m glad you found more family happy to connect with you. Your birth dad took quite some time in a very ugly manner to process his feelings, you are allowed to take your time if you ever decide to fix that bridge, not obliged though. \nAlso, enjoy the holidays with your family, it\u2019s about having fun and love, idk what\u2019s the obsession people have with trying to fix shitload years of problems one day of the year.", "Your bro is very young though , again take the time you need but he might deserve a chance of a relationship", "If you think it\u2019s easy to just let that go. You need to step back", "He would be 14 this year, I haven\u2019t talked to him since I left.  I think he was scared because he was dealing with cancer and the family blow up and thought I caused it somehow because dad seemed mad at me.  I don\u2019t blame him because he was a kid and he like worships his dad, but the last things he said to me were pretty cruel so I don\u2019t think I can talk to him right now.", "If you think you should blame the innocent child in all of this, YOU need to step back.", "No one said anything about it being easy to let go. The problem here is taking out anger on the child. The child didn't ask to be conceived by a cheater. The child doesn't deserve any hatred or maltreatment by the wronged person. It's really not that hard to understand.", "No doubt he was parroting your dad. Look I'm not saying you can't have them in your lives if you don't want to. You are getting advice from strangers off the internet so take everything with a grain of salt but, to me there is no point of no return here. Like another person commented if this is accurate your \"dad\" said \"you should be grateful I want to reconnect.\" What an AH thing to say. Did your mom and \"dad\" expect for you to grovel and beg for forgiveness for being brought into this world? These people who were supposed to protect you and love you let you down big time. No matter what anybody says this is not your fault. It's your parents'. I wouldn't be surprised if your mother refused to give you your bio dad's name. \ud83d\ude44"]}
