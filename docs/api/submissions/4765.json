Boat gets damaged m, dad graciously drives 2 hours so you & your wife can continue using the FREE boat & you have the nerve to help repair it and take him to lunch as a thank you!  The horror!! The title makes it sound like he came for the week. NTA but you would have been if you hadn\u2019t helped and taken him to lunch before he drove an additional 2 hours home.  Your wife is exceedingly ungrateful & entitled", "NTA\n\nim looking at divorce here. your wife sounds exhaustingly possessive and ungrateful.", "Your Wife is the AH end of story. Your dad was a legend to help you both out.", "YTA. Simply taking him for a thanks lunch would\u2019ve been fine.

Your dad wanted to fix it right then and there, fine, that\u2019s his right as owner. You didn\u2019t have to have a boys\u2019 day during your honeymoon, though.

If any random Airbnb host was called they would be expected to come and fix the problem without being taken to lunch. I get it\u2019s your father, but you could see him over lunch another time. Your wife is understandably annoyed, she is meant to be feeling desired and romanced by her new husband who should be prioritising their new marriage with passion and intimacy rather than having a family lunch. Your Dad said he\u2019d be out of your hair but YOU took him out while she sat at home on her honeymoon, what a way to make a woman feel unattractive and neglected.", "NTA yall need to chill the honeymoon was 1 WEEK long not to mention they were on OP's father's property, You really think a dude in his early or late 50's is supposed to do manual labours for hours by himself?

Congrats, you've had your first married fight where there are no winners.  \nYou wanted to thank your dad for helping you out. Your new wife wanted to only be with you as a couple for a chunk of time before seeing everyone you both know and love together, as a unit. Both are completely valid.

Neither one of you is wrong.", "Soft YTA. You spent time with your dad fixing the boat. You should have said \u201cI owe you lunch soon\u201d or something. You basically spent the whole day together.", "INFO:\n\nWhat was the issue with the boat? You said something minor. Did it prevent the boat from being used?\n\nI would say NTA, but I think it would have us to get a better idea if you could explain what the issue with the boat was. \n\nYour father took time off his from his work to help fix something on the boat. You said he left after two hours of you eating lunch with him. I think you should have invited your wife, but It doesn\u2019t sound like she went or even would have gone because she didn\u2019t want your father coming in the first place. You still had the rest of the day after lunch to spend with your wife. Yes, it\u2019s your honeymoon and you should be spending time together.

Not for letting him come, but for then inviting him for lunch after your wife made her reservations clear. Yes, your dad did a very nice thing and was even nice enough to say he'd be on his way right away.

Bare minimum you could have invited her along.", "YTA.  \n\nMaybe a soft AH, but still.

Communication with your wife could have been improved. I think \"invading\" your honeymoon is a bit dramatic.

Perhaps you could have called a local mechanic instead. \n\nTotally agree about taking him out when you go back. Probably should have discussed wanting to take him out with your wife first.

NAH. They showed appreciation for the dad fixing the boat, who I\u2019m sure was more than happy to help his son and new DIL since it was their honeymoon. It\u2019s called a favor folks. The dad even said he\u2019d be quick and out of their hair in no time. They could\u2019ve then taken him to lunch to say thank you after the honeymoon. Everyone saying NTA because the dad ~deserved immediate appreciation~ is ridiculous IMO. He received immediate appreciation, verbally. They thanked the dad for doing them a favor, and they could have done something nice once they got back. There isn\u2019t a timer for showing appreciation, and the dad clearly wasn\u2019t expecting anything, nor was he bothered about coming out to fix the boat. Lunch didn\u2019t need to be done right then and there, and it\u2019s not like they were ungrateful to the dad.

Are you going to let it ruin your honeymoon?  Time for some perspective folks- or are we jumping to divorce and red flags now", "Complaining because your partner helped their dad, who come out of their way to fix a boat you both were enjoying, and then shouting him lunch spending a few hours all up, because he wasn't worshiping at his wifes feet for a few hours, is definitely not a great way to start a marriage.", "'Daddy?' Seriously? You're being immature and petty.", "wth? you cant help out just because you are not mechanically inclined? lol. i cant fix a car but i sure know how to fetch tools or what not. \n\nyeah. totally agree that OP should just divorce her asap. poor man got caught cold by an ungrateful woman.", "Few days ? More like a few hours.", "And? Is he supposed to treat his own father like he\u2019d treat a stranger he hired for repair? I\u2019ve been a newly wed bride too and let me tell you, I wouldn\u2019t have withered and died if my husband helped his own father repair a boat for us and took him to lunch as a thank you. Especially when the dad drove 2 hrs out of his way on a work day just so we could enjoy the boat.", "It's not that easy if you do not know what you're doing, also that would've taken so much more time. It would be like trying to tell my dad how to fix his infected pc over the phone, it's just much faster and easier for me to come over. Making a mistake during the fixing process could worsen the problem.", ">Hi Dad could have explained what to do over the phone.\n\nHaha, that's funny. \n\nOh... you're serious.", "So what is the alternative here in your eyes? \n\nThey both wanted to use the boat, obviously OP felt confident enough to help but not to fix it. So they called dad who took time off out of his work week to fix *his* boat on *his* property that they wanted to use. \n\nIs OP just supposed to almost ignore dad the whole time? \u201cOh hey thanks for coming to fix it, see ya later\u201d \u201coh it\u2019s fixed?! Thank god now we can use it, bye. I\u2019ll treat you later ;)\u201d How much more of a doormat can you make the father feel like? Just rub your muddy boots into his forehead why dont\u2019ya. \n\nThe fact that OP\u2019s wife feels \u201cintruded on\u201d because OP helped and thanked his father for fixing the thing *they both wanted to use* is telling. Even if you assume it took the entirety of 24 hours, that\u2019s still only 1 out of 14 days or 7.14% of the honeymoon. That\u2019s not a ton to get to use **a boat for free** and have a great place to stay completely cost free. Fuck, if I were OP\u2019s wife I\u2019d have been making sandwiches and drinks for them just because I\u2019d be excited to get to use a boat however I want on private property completely free of charge. You can fuck as much as you want the remainder of the thirteen days, and you\u2019ll still be sore as hell after it all, one day isn\u2019t that much in comparison to 14. And this is assuming he dedicated an entire 24 hours to his father which, let\u2019s be real, isn\u2019t likely. Even working \u201call day\u201d is closer to 18.", "I have a hard time attributing responsibility to the bride.", "Partner of a few days as in they got married a few days ago, I didn't say he left for a few days.", "Hey dad. I know you drove 2 hours out here to come help me out, but now that the problem is solved and I don't need your help anymore please leave without even getting a bite to eat so that my new wife and I can go have fun on YOUR boat. \n\nSeems reasonable", "Sounds like OPs wife was fine with just spending the week with OP on her honeymoon and didn\u2019t need the boat.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t happy with the father coming in the first place and even after that OP went to the pub. \n\nOP really doesn\u2019t know how to read his new wife\u2019s feelings which doesn\u2019t bode well for the future.\n\nETA - just to be clear, OP knew his wife wasn\u2019t happy with the plans before dad even drove out. Whether she was being reasonable or not, he should have understood that she wasn\u2019t happy on their honeymoon and taken that into consideration.", "As neither of us knows the problem or the OP's knowledge, either of us could be right....", "Why is everyone assuming the OP is incompetent?", "Exactly. Even if we overlook the sexism of wifey making sandwiches and drinks, she could have hung out, helped with the boat, made conversation etc etc. OP\u2019s dad was doing them a  massive favour. She should have made an effort to thank him.", "I mean honeymoon isn't all about fucking it's about spending time with your new spouse. Even if wife isn't mechanically inclined & didn't feel comfortable working on the boat, where was she for lunch & drinks? \n\nWhat bugs me is he never mentioned that he said anything to her. Just that he took dad out. \n\nAlthough the dad was doing a real solid thing for them, was the wife involved at all? Did they offer for her to go out when they left for lunch? Or did she just look out the window and they were gone? \n\nJust because they aren't fucking doesn't mean she can't feel ditched, especially if communication was lacking.", "And letting us stay at your vacation house for free.", ">OP really doesn\u2019t know how to read his new wife\u2019s feelings\n\nMaybe wifey should communicate then, instead of expecting OP to be a mind reader and not help his dad.\n\nHer inability to communicate really doesn't \n\n>bode well for the future", "Or her feelings are unreasonable. You can feel whatever you want but some feelings are unreasonable and you shouldn\u2019t expect them to be catered to. Half a day out of 14 days for something that will improve your experience isn\u2019t something to get pissy about. A normal human would feel grateful the dad did that for them.", "There's some truth in that, though one final argument from me, would you let your dad fix your pc by himself with you over the phone or would you rather come over and do it yourself? For me it's obviously the latter (even though in the beginning of the pc era my dad was a ddos programmer).", "Hell I\u2019m a dude with a beard who knows nothing about boats and I\u2019d have been making my wife some gosh darn sammies for fixing a boat we are gonna use on our honeymoon. Throw a maids outfit on me while I\u2019m at it my ass looks great in them. No sexism intended at all.", "I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realise the wife was a toddler who needed to be told what to do. The image of her forlornly looking out the window as he drives away with his dad is hilarious to me. I doubt a woman who whined about his dad coming to fix the boat for them wouldn\u2019t whine that the dad hijacked their date even if she was invited to go. Sounds like her world revolves around her.", "Communication works both ways, if she felt excluded you can always at least watch, if you\u2019re *that* mechanically inept that you can\u2019t even grab tools or anything (plenty of people are, nothing wrong with that). She could have even gone out with them to thank him if she had asked about plans afterwards or talked to them throughout the day. \n\n**if** he just ditched her then absolutely THATS an AH move, but nowhere in the post or comments have I seen anything to infer that, so based on the information given I\u2019m going NAH. \n\nAnd again, one day out of 14 isn\u2019t invading if you\u2019re helping by the couples own request. You\u2019re telling me that if you spend 13 days attached at the hip on your honeymoon and one out with your father helping fix something you\u2019re going to use on said honeymoon that I\u2019m mistreating my wife?", "I don't really know where you got \"needs told what to do\" from my comment but go off I guess lmao \n\nOnce again, We. Don't. Know. What. Wife. Was. Doing. Sure, not working on the boat. Doesn't mean she wasn't busy. I've been caught up in stuff before just to realize my husband has dashed out to the store or something without me noticing. It's not unheard of, or even that ridiculous??? \n\nJust feel like one side of this story is lacking quite a bit.", "I didn't say anyone was mistreating anyone. I'm just feeling like we don't have the whole picture, especially regarding \n\n1. what the wife did while they worked on the boat (it's possible to be helpful/working even if she wasn't standing staring at them fixing the boat, crazy how people keep ignoring that??) - maybe she was cleaning up after their previous meals, maybe she was tidying the house, maybe she did laundry, maybe she was working on something in the garage. We. Don't. Know. I haven't seen OP comment on that. \n\n2. OPs attitude toward his wife. Was she asked or told? Was he dismissive when she said she'd rather he spend time with her, or did he genuinely lay out his side and she agreed (even if reluctantly)? Did he say \"I want to take dad out for helping us today, I'd like you to come with us\" or was it  \"I'm taking dad to lunch, you can tag along if you want I guess\"? \n\nI, too, lean toward NAH rather than N. T. A. Because I don't feel like his wife is an AH. She felt a certain way. She communicated it to him. He got hurt by that and came to Reddit. They both need to work on communication.", "I\u2019m saying if she wanted to be involved she could have been. She doesn\u2019t have to be asked. She could\u2019ve just sat and watched them fix it. Or if she had something better to do then she did that. OP even says he tried to convince her to go to lunch with them. \n\nSounds like the only thing she wanted was for the dad to not be there.", "why would he be arrested for having 3 beers in 2 hours?\n\nwhat do you think his blood alcohol level is at that point?", "3 pints maybe, 3 bottles nah."]}
