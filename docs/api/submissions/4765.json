You have a free place for your honeymoon, he drove two hours out of his way and had to drive two hours back. He fixed the boat so your wife could enjoy the experience. Come on people, show a little gratitude! When your father reads this he\u2019ll probably think twice before he goes out of his way for the new wifely. She sounds selfish.", "NTA and good luck with your wife. Yikes.", "NTA\n\nHe didn't invade at all, he came to help y'all and you treated him to lunch as a thank you, I see noooo issue jeez", "Yes, soft YTA.Him coming Iver to fix it was nice of him, as is you wanting to thank him, bit you could have scheduled to take him out after your honeymoon was over", "I'm gonna go with N T A bc it was a week. You spent 2hrs with him out of a week. \n\nWell now wait. Where were you when he was working on the boat?\n\nETA OP spent most of the day with dad, changed to YTA", "Hmm... let me get this clear: you were on your honeymoon, and instead of promising your father you'd take him for burgers and brew on your return from same, you hied off and ignored your new wife for a few hours.\n\nSlightly skewed priorities, there, me bucko. Your wife was reluctant - get a clue stick. \n\nYTA, mate-y.", "YTA.\n\nHim coming over to fix the boat makes enough sense.\n\nBut you took him out to lunch *in the middle of your honeymoon.* What a terrible idea - your wife is understandably annoyed about it.", "I was going N A H, but because you already spectrum a big part of the day with your dad fixing his boot... YTA, only the dinner would have been OK. But a full day... not a good idea", "YTA. You could have taken him to lunch after your honeymoon.", "NTA. Several hours with your father on 1-day out of 2- weeks doesn't seem like a big deal to me. Especially since it was your parents boat, and your parents vacation property. I'd be raising an eyebrow at your wife for making a large mountain out of a very small molehill.", "YTA; really on your honeymoon you go to lunch with someone else- anyone else for any reason is wrong, offer to go another day and take him to lunch after the honeymoon.", "Soft YTA\n\nThere were plenty of ways to say thank you and show your appreciation after your honeymoon.", "INFO: did you guys have any special plans that you had to cancel besides delaying the boat ride? \n\nIf the response to this is no, then NTA, if it\u2019s just a couple of hours. If the response is \u201cyes, I was gone for half a day and she was waiting for me and I ruined XYZ\u201d, then yeah YWBTA.", "NTA. You guys were AT HIS HOUSE when he came TO FIX HIS BOAT for you to use", "NTA", "Did you and your wife use the boat at any time after he fixed it?", "YTA.\n\nYou could have taking him to lunch to thenk him AFTER the honeymoon.", "What\u2019s \u201ca few beers\u201d", "NTA you were being civilised to a close family member you not only let you use their property but also went out of their way yo make sure it was in top working order during your honeymoon. \nThe NAH thing for her to do would have been to go to lunch too or send him some flowers.\n If it was going to be an issue no one should have told him about the boat till after the trip.", "YTA / it was your honeymoon you could\u2019ve taken your dad out to lunch afterwards", " NTA. He drove two hours to fix it and that\u2019s another 2 hours drive home after working. A lunch and some beers is nothing in the scheme of things even if it was during the honey moon.", "NTA you guys make it out like the dad stayed for the whole honeymoon when it was like a few hours maybe half day and to help them out with a boat that they wanted to use the dad didn't have to go out of his way to fix the boat for them to enjoy. Get over urself if u think of or op dad is a ah. The only one that a ah is the wife for complaining and ungrateful.", "YTA you had plans with your wife, on your honeymoon, and took your dad out to lunch instead.\n\nThere were other ways to thank him.", "Considering all of your comments, NTA. If your honeymoon were only 3-5 days, I would understand why you spending 2+ hours with someone else is considered significant. However, I don't anticipate that fixing a boat alone is easy, your honeymoon is 2 weeks long, and your father used his PTO to drive a considerable distance to fix a boat for you both.  He also ate and then return home.\n\nI agree with other comments that you \\*could\\* have waited, but not waiting doesn't make you an asshole considering that you spent the rest of the evening together and now have 13 days to use \\*your father's\\* vacation home and boat.   \nIt was very considerate of your parents and respectful of you to treat him then.\n\nIn the future, better planning and open communication about expectations could go a long way.", "YTA - Obviously for ditching your wife on her honeymoon to drink with your Dad. But also for being ignorant comments about drinking and driving.", "But it was your honeymoon!! Don't you know you were supposed to hibernate in your honeymoon suite, go at it like rabbits, only emerging into the sunlight, blinking in the light of the day, at the end of the designated honeymoon when you return to 'real' life?\n\nAccording to your bride's thinking:\n\n\\[1\\] You should NOT have had the ongoing use of the boat while you were there and not told your father until you were packing up.\n\n\\[2\\] You should have NOT thanked your father for fixing the boat for both to use.\n\n\\[3\\] You should have NOT gone out of the house at all, nor met or interacted with anyone, not gone on the cruise, nor socialised at all.\n\nESH ~~NTA but soft TA to your partner who seems to have a slightly unrealistic view of what a honeymoon is.~~", "NAH, you are young newlyweds: probably no one in history has completely known what they or their spouses had in mind, or how to ask about it, or how to express it, off the get-go. It didn't occur to you to put a pause on fixing the boat. You felt grateful and much obliged to your dad. You didn't think through how it would work for him to be there for a partial day during your honeymoon. \n\nYour wife (congrats on your marriage!) likely had some simple but high hopes for just-the-two-of-you time that day, felt disappointed, temporarily lonely, and possibly self-conscious about having her FIL around on your honeymoon. Acknowledge her hurt feelings and make it up to her. \n\nIn future, honeymoon or not, even if you and your wife don't have specific plans, talk together about what would make your evening/day/ great. You can talk through what's important to you in advance, and then savor the simple evenings/mornings/afternoons together. If you get a sense for what you are each envisioning you'll have a lot better chance of realizing it.", "Info: What country is this and when you say 3 beers, what strength?", "Very soft YTA because you should've taken him out for the \"thank you\" meal  *after*  your honeymoon", "[deleted]", "Yeah YTA", "I asked her if she wants to tag along and tried to convince her to come because they have some nice seafood", "On the next season of White Lotus\u2026", "So not only did OP's dad do the newlyweds a solid of letting them use the vacation house and a boat for their honeymoon, the guy used his PTO to come out and fix the boat. \n\n1 day out of 2 weeks is not intruding on their honeymoon. Helping your dad repair the boat and taking him out to lunch was a kind gesture. \n\nNTA, OP's wife needs to get a grip and show some gratitude toward the family she married into.", "I was helping him. I\u2019m not going to lounge around while my dad is doing manual labor.", "This is ridiculous. If I was in OPs wife's position I would be so grateful that he took a day off work and drove four hours round trip to fix the boat we were using for FREE. Y'all act like honeymoons are some sort of sacred ritual.", "Our plan originally was to take the boat out and have a few drinks on the water front and then go out clubbing. Which we did later in the day.", "He had 3 I had one.", "&#x200B;\n\nThe key here, oh numeral-list insistent one, is that he did that without his new bride. Meeting folk and family during a honeymoon? Sure, maybe - after they're done fucking like bunnies for the moment and need to breathe. Leaving your spouse alone for hours while you pal around with your dad? Nope. Inconsiderate at best, and foreshadowing at worst.", "America and 5 percent", "I don\u2019t know how the strength of the beers is relevant but now I need to know more\u2026 Brand? Craft beer?", "Wording suggests wife was not included in lunch.", "For future reference \"tag along\" is not an invite to a lot of people it says \"we don't really want you there but you can be clingy and come, if you want\"\n\nIt's the difference between \n\"You can stop by if you want\" and \"I'd like you to stop by\"\n\nOne makes the invitee feel like baggage, the other makes them feel wanted.\n\nYou want your new wife to feel wanted, right?", "You asked your wife if she wanted to \"tag along\" on part put your honeymoon?! Now that's funny. YTA", "And the last ...", "Yup, that's the problem. You spent most of a day having a boys day with your dad. YTA", "downvoters really seem so unhinged, he wasn't helping his dad do some random manual labor, he joined to fix something that the 2 of them wanted to use on their honeymoon lol", "You said it was a minor issue, so why didn't you fix it yourself instead of getting your dad to drive 2 hours...", "So really, all that happened was your wife of x days got to spend most of a day alone. \n\nOn her honeymoon.", "So you feel bad that he had to drive out during the work week but he had 3 beers in the middle of a work day?", "I do like my numbers! lol. OK I see your point but... father made a 4-hour round trip on a work day to fix an amenity for their honeymoon; only polite to give him lunch. BUT I agree, OP should have consulted bride first. I'll change my verdict.", "Oof", "That too", "Lol no? He asked for his dads help fixing a boat they BOTH wanted to go on and he didn\u2019t just want to watch his dad do all the work, also having two people do it than just once probs made them fix it quicker", "Yes cause the intricacies of boat mechanics is something everybody knows...", "1 day, a few hours occupying herself, at the family's vacation house on the water is hardly the tragedy you are making it out to be.", "Yeah\u2026 he used his hard earned pto to take the day off. Don\u2019t know why you\u2019re trying to make it sound like I got him drunk while he was supposed to be at work.", "I'm not overly pleased with the father, either, TBH. He knew his son was honeymooning, did him a big favour with the boat fix, sure, but didn't insist he should be left alone to do the work, and further didn't insist on another day for the thank you meal. \n\nFrankly, both of the gents in this story suck for their behaviours.", "Oh, my, did I call it a tragedy? Let me go through my notes.", "Because he then had to make the two hour drive after consuming three beers?", "Well you didn\u2019t say he took PTO, that\u2019s actually kind of an important detail and I could see why you felt bad.", "I don\u2019t think you understand how alcohol affects a 230 pound man who\u2019s been drinking since he\u2019s 16 compared to a 15 year old kid who just discovered how to shotgun a natty light.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think you understand either.", "No, it's really you who doesn't.\n\nIt's weird that you assume he's drunk driving on the basis of '3 beers'.\n\nIf he'd had 3 'standard' beers where I'm from, over 2 hours, he'd have a BAC of .0275 which is well within the legal driving limit.\n\nIf he'd had light beers, he'd be even more within the limit.\n\nIf he'd had 3 pints of imperial stout, he'd be well over the limit.\n\n'Beer' varies. But there's no reason to assume he's driving drunk.", "Oh I understand how it\u2019s pretty fucking idiotic to comment on alcohol tolerance when there are factors like food consumed, hydration, weight, height, drinking experience, and time in between drinks.\n\nTry again bud", "You don't know what you're talking about. Food consumed, height, \"drinking experience \" don't freaking matter. Drinking and driving kills people because idiots like you and your Dad think that their experience means they can drink and drive better than those other people...", "So if he got stopped, he wouldn't be arrested? \n\nHe's still drunk even if only with 3 beers. You're NTA for taking him out to lunch, given he was doing you a favour, but both you and your dad are TA for thinking it's OK for him to drink and drive. That's just idiotic."]}
