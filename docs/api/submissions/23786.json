We have 2 kids and 2 dogs until recently when we rescued a third. (Space is fine, we spend lots of time outside). When my SIL had her baby last October, we moved our camper to their property so i could be her childcare. My husband was still traveling, and we only saw him once a week. We were staying there for free so i didn\u2019t expect her to pay me. \n\nFast forward to March of this year. I told her i missed my husband and would be going back on the road until my son starts school this year. Told her she needed to find childcare by April first, because that was when i was leaving. She didn\u2019t find childcare until the day before we left. We came back last weekend, and there were some mix ups with the RV park we were supposed to be staying in back here in our hometown, and we didn\u2019t have a spot once we got there. SIL says no problem, you can come back here until you guys can get in. I asked if i needed to watch the baby or can we just pay rent, she said \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it!\u201d \n\nWhen we left in April, i told her she needed to get her baby on a waitlist for a daycare because i will be too busy to take care of her if we moved back. She didn\u2019t. She had her husbands sister keep the baby, and never found a daycare. She\u2019s been having issues with the sister taking the baby to strangers houses and getting stranded with no gas in 110\u00b0 heat so i said i would keep the baby ONLY until she got her into a daycare. She said \u201cno, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m looking into daycares now\u201d so then night before last, she comes to me and says \u201c_____ got a job. Can you start keeping her next week?\u201d I told her i could but she still needed to find a daycare. She said \u201cI\u2019m not finding anything that\u2019s in the price range i want to pay\u201d. Ended up keeping the baby yesterday and after realizing how HARD it was going to be on me with a puppy, toddler, one starting school, and a mobile baby, i told her i couldn\u2019t mentally handle it and we could discuss rent for the remainder of our time there. She said \u201cyou\u2019re my only option\u201d \n\nThings is, we\u2019re about to buy a house. It\u2019s not my problem that she keeps waiting to find childcare until the last minute. I can\u2019t schedule buying a home around her being a procrastinator. I\u2019m so fed up with her i want to leave today and force her to figure it out. She never looked into childcare costs when pregnant because she always just assumed the stay at home sister in law would keep the baby. She wants to pay $800/month.

Maybe you can tell her you will cover HALF (600) of the child care until you are off the property? But the offer only stands as long as she gets a babysitter in the next week. You really are trapped between a rock and hard place. Sadly it sounds like shes going to have to learn the hard way to do things herself.", "Info, how long were you supposed to stay originally?", "NTA. She's obviously taking advantage of you.", "NTA", "No is a full sentence.\nYou have your own kids and responsibilities.\nYou are not \"the help\".\nYou help in an emergency and when you can and when you want.\nThis is not an emergency this is just being cheap and irresponsible.\nNTA", "That's a her problem... let her know what day you'll be gone and go... situation sucks but that's part of having kids, tell her to apply for aide.\n\nNTA", "NTA with slight ESH tendencies. \n\nYou kind of traded the free parking spot with being the childcare to be honest. So the whole situation is kind of a mess and as long as you still park there im kinda leaning on ESH to be honest.
