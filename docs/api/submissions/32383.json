I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s trekked through 3 years already alone. Poor woman must be completely burnt out.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not easy to change jobs or move across state lines so I understand your hesitation.

I'm a city dweller and have no desire whatsoever to move to the middle of nowhere to raise a family. I'm also vehemently against it as I lived in villages as a child and it was incredibly boring and isolating.\n\nMy wife is on exactly the same page as me, which is something we discussed before children entered the equation. Neither of our families live close by.\n\nUnfortunately, your wife has decided that she doesn't want to raise children in the city. I doubt she really hates New York, but it helps her feel more justified in her decision if she convinces herself that she does.\n\nI've no doubt she wants help from her family with the triplets - and that's not unreasonable, hence the NAH.\n\nThat all said, you have my sympathy. You probably will end up leaving your job and lifestyle for something a lot more sedate elsewhere. Your wife will be happy and your children will hopefully thrive. You'll also be doing the \"responsible thing\". That doesn't mean you shouldn't be upset about what you have to give up. I'd be gutted.", "YTA.  If you had changed your mind why didn't you have the conversation with her?  The last agreement you two had was you guys would move when the time was right.  She gave you plenty of time.  And then to claim you were shocked when your wife said she wanted to move \"out of the blue\" is really being disingenuous.\n\nAt the end of the day the party who wants to change an agreed upon plan has the obligation to open the conversation and discuss the change.  You didn't do that so YTA.", "NAH\n\nYou are in a partnership so you own 50% of the decision. Changing circumstances dictate change decisions.

It might be that you\u2019re not ready, and need another couple of years. \n\nBut you\u2019ve got to do it eventually, and you may as well do it before the kids start school. The truth is, the kids will be better off not growing up in NYC.", "YTA. NYC is super cool when you are out and about in the city and working all day. For a SAHM with three toddlers, being stuck inside a NYC-sized apartment all day sounds like a nightmare.", "You\u2019re allowed to changed your mind just as your wife is allowed to not change hers.\n\nI think you need to go back to your wife with a bit more of an open mind and work with her to identify  the benefits that she believes the family will get out of the Midwest and the current shortcoming of New York, then vice versa. Is talks of being near her family a signal your wife is feeling overwhelmed taking care of the kids? Is that something that can be resolved by hiring a full time nanny, moving to a bigger place? Can you afford that in New York? Communicate with your wife!\n\nYou are right that it would be too immediate to plan for an out of state move, but that\u2019s not an excuse that will keep working for the next 15 years.

That's certainly something you don't wait 10 years to tell your SO.", "YTA\nThe reality that I see is that moving back to the Midwest is most likely based upon more than your oartner's dislike of NY and grounded more in 2 things: (1) the fact that she sees the Midwest as an area more conducive to raising children and (2) being closer to family, especially with triplets, would be a huge help/support as the children get older. Family connection and having extended family around is very important to some people when they move beyond just being a couple. Having the back up of grandparents and potentially aunts and uncles can provide a huge support if kids become unwell, need medical attention, parents want to have a night off and need a trusted sitter, etc. The bright lights of the big city fade for many as family takes center and \"partying\" recedes from your weekend plans. It's an adjust but it's also a maturing, an evolution into another phase of life. \n\nAcknowledging your partner's needs is hugely important and discussing this could go a long to avoiding resentment that might build if you decide to shut down a very legitimate plan. \n\nThink carefully.", "NTA people are entitled to change their opinion\u2026however, if you want to stay with your wife, it might be a matter of being flexible on where you live\u2026", "Yeah YTA.  You know for a fact that your wife is unhappy in NYC.  You don\u2019t know for a fact that you won\u2019t be happy elsewhere.

Did you at least once talk to her about your change in view?", "ESH\n\nYou don\u2019t brush off life-changing plans like moving and you can\u2019t change your mind and not speak about it. The fact that you reached a point where you decided that you didn\u2019t want to move but *did not* say that to your wife tells me that you knew she was serious about moving sooner rather than later. So you didn\u2019t tell her how you really felt because you didn\u2019t want to honor your tentative agreement to move. You pretended it wasn\u2019t an issue until it reared its head again.\n\nI don\u2019t know why your wife is deciding that things must happen now without a plan or definite agreement in place. \u201cLater\u201d sounds like an excuse to me, but she interpreted that as a promise with some semblance of a timeline.\n\nYou need to have a discussion about this.

This is not out of the blue", "Why does your wife hate living in NYC? Is it because she is home with 3 small children in a (probably) tight apartment, since almost all NYC apartments are tight? It's much more of a hassle to have kids in the city, dealing with the schlep up and down and the busy streets and for your wife, isolation. You, I assume, are off doing grown-up stuff at the office and don't deal with that. Why don't you see if you can find a way to make city and childcare easier for your wife and help her get connected with others? Or move to Westchester if what she wants is a house with a yard? Those 3 Midwestern states are pretty big, and it sounds like she wouldn't even see her family much if she is on one state and they are in another.", "NAH.

It sounds like you've already delayed on fulfilling your promise. You definitely should try to move before they start kindergarten so they don't miss a year of developing a community at their new school. \n\nAlso,  you have plenty of time to plan a move before the fall. My wife and I decided to move from Texas back to the midwest in September and we were moved in by May.  And we both worked and needed to find jobs. Maybe your job/house/school search ends up taking longer,  but theres no reason to start trying with Fall as the goal. You can also live apart temporarily if you need more time and the kids need to start school (assuming you can afford it or she has family that would be willing to take them in for a bit).\n\nI would dust off that resume....or decide that what you want is more important than what you promised your wife and come to terms with the potential consequences of that decision", "YTA - idk why the first comment (at this time) is N A H...", "YTA because you obviously changed your mind about moving and never talked to her about it. It\u2019s fine to change your mind, but you need to talk to the other person about the why\u2019s and when\u2019s, especially for something as big as a move across the country. It sounds to me like you never wanted to leave and might\u2019ve told her \u2018one day\u2019 with no timeline while she was pregnant because you had no intentions of moving back but didn\u2019t want to flat out say no for like false hope is better than no hope?? \nI got pregnant and raised my son for a year 2000km away from any family and friends, my pregnancy also came as a surprise and we agreed to stay until we could figure out a move. Being isolated at home all day, especially with three babies and then toddlers with none of \u201cyour\u201d people (family and life long friends or friends with deep connection) around is just not sustainable mentally for a stay at home mom. Even if your children go to school, she\u2019s still experiencing all of the good and bad parts of being a mom with out being able to share that closely to the people she loves best. Personally, it killed me. On those impossible days when she didn\u2019t know how she made it through, it\u2019s possible the thought of being close to her family one day comforted her. And you\u2019ve essentially taken that away from her, and you\u2019re also telling her you have no intention to do something you agreed to. I\u2019m sure she feels betrayed and stuck somewhere she might be unhappy. Not having a timeline is probably really hard so she tried to get one by asking about the schools, so you should discuss that next, and \u201cwhen we have everything together\u201d or something of that kind is not a timeline. Specific tasks that need to be done, milestones that need to be reached, or changes of lifestyle or even a calendar date if it\u2019s that simple etc, everything that has to get sorted before you\u2019d consider moving.

Maybe she needs a housekeeper/nanny so she can work. Maybe she just needs a few afternoons off (although she should get this since the kids are in preschool).  Maybe she thinks you work too much especially if there is an attractive coworker.
