She stood out because it was too late to be alone, still in uniform on a school night & it was freezing. \n\nI approached her, asked if she was ok & she said yes. I didn\u2019t want to leave her alone so I sent my son to talk to her. Guessing it was easier to talk to someone her age but long story short, she\u2019s a runaway. As a teacher I\u2019m aware of safeguarding procedure so made the relevant phone calls & as I have the necessary credentials, police cleared me to take her home for the night.\n\nTurns out her case is familiar to the police & she\u2019s also run away from several homes they\u2019ve placed her in. We spoke a lot & she confided in me the details she didn\u2019t share with my son. I won\u2019t elaborate but she\u2019s been through it. \n\nI felt sorry for her & after a lot of paperwork, I was granted temporary guardianship which the courts were thrilled with because she hasn\u2019t stayed anywhere else more than a week. \n\nShe was with me for around 4 months before the incident occurred. She got home very late on a school night & I told her this was unacceptable. She threw a tantrum & said I\u2019m not her parent, she\u2019ll just leave. I told her although I can\u2019t force her to stay, while she\u2019s under my roof, the household rules have to be followed. Not just because I said so, but for her safety. Bear in mind we\u2019re dealing with a child who came home with me after meeting me in a park, so not the most streetwise. (Obvs didn\u2019t say that).\n\nShe shouted & argued back but I didn\u2019t respond. I\u2019m guessing she wanted a reaction out of me because with her next threat, she got it. She threatened to tell authorities my son had been inappropriate with her. I asked her if there was any truth to it to which she said no, apologised & said she was just angry. I\u2019ll be honest, after that I didn\u2019t hesitate to go to my room, call the police & have her removed from my custody. \n\nAs I called she overheard & started crying, apologising & begging me not to send her back. Ngl I t was hard to watch her get put in the police car while crying out to me.\n\nHer caseworker has since suggested we enter mediation & try again with the temporary guardianship as this is the most stable she\u2019s been in terms of school attendance, grades etc. As much as I\u2019d like to help her, I can\u2019t risk my son for her sake. \n\nMy friends have said it was cruel to give up after 1 mistake given she\u2019s been doing so well, & I\u2019m an ah for \u201ctossing\u201d her out.

And that hurts.", "NTA, she could destroy your lives with that kind of accusation against your son. She sounds like a very troubled kid and that's incredibly sad, but your family comes first.", "As you probably know, kids who have experienced trauma and neglect often lie so it's not at all unexpected that she lashed out in that way. That's probably all she has to fight back with when she feels cornered and unable to control emotions/impulses. A friend in high-school who was fostered would 'test' her foster parents for the first year or two to see what it would take for them to kick her out...in a way, she wanted proof they cared about her and wouldn't abuse her physically and this was her misguided way of seeking security. Once she felt safe/secure, it stopped. \n\nI can't imagine any teen with her history wouldn't come with their fair share of baggage so while her behaviour isn't unexpected, I understand your position in wanting to protect your son. I would have that as a concern also. If it got to the stage where she made an allegation to authorities...even if she recanted eventually, the experience would be pretty traumatic for your son either way and yes, you could potentially end up being blamed for bringing the girl into your home to begin with.\n\nIt's tricky. You probably need validation because you're feeling emotionally torn. Give it some time and discuss the situation with the case workers. Ultimately, your first responsibility it towards your own child and no one can blame you for that. You're not doing it because you can't be bothered or because you don't care...her comment triggered your protective instincts, justifiably.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s a threat she\u2019s prepared to use against your kid.

This wasn't only just a simple mistake, this was an accusation that can ruin a life. If she can't understand how unacceptable it was, it can never work out. \n\nJust make sure it's on record that she made this false accusation already. The impulsive nature of teenagers can make them do and say stupid things. But you definitely don't set a good example for your own kid by telling him there's no second chances in life, that you should always be defined by a single error in judgement. Maybe have a conversation with your son, doesn't hurt to get his input on the matter.", "This is way above the pay grade of AITA.  You need to talk to her case worker about her threat, what the risk is to your son, what the risk is to her.  She's obviously severely injured, there are no easy answers.  But right now, she's a teen girl who really needs some help, and what you've done has been working.  So see if you can figure out how to make it work.", "NTA. You took her in 4 months more than most people would have.", "NTA She's young & troubled but you have to protect your son from false accusations. She may try to use that again. It could take time & money to prove innocence from a false accusation. Being accused could stick with him through gossip and even paperwork. You tried and staying in her life as a friend may work. I feel bad for her and hope she does have a good future.", "NTA\n\nYou were blackmailed essentially into giving in or your son be put into the system for a sex crime the girl admitted never happened.  I have a friend whose brother almost was jailed for false claims. It took thousands and a courtroom to learn he was innocent. \n\nI feel for that girl.  Its a horrible reality she is in. Thats is no reason to give her a chance to destroy another child's life because she doesn't know consequences and integrity. \n\nYou did the correct thing immediately asking her if it was true. You then did the correct thing protecting your son.", "Tbh I see no asshole here. I get your stand and you are absolutely right for it. I also would not appreciate threats to my child in my house but I also think that her acting out was probably due to trauma. She probably felt safe in your house and got insecure about whether you may make her leave and thought that a threat may stabilize her position somewhat and as soon as it backfired she saw her mistake and apologized. I think that stuff needs to be talked through but the ultimate decision is yours to make and neither would be wrong to make.", "NTA - False accusations, in many ways, are more dangerous than true ones. True accusations can be dealt with, appropriate consequences determined, etc. False accusations empower the lair to continue with the lies as people tend to believe the accuser much much much more than the accused. That, of course, is great when the allegation is true, not so great when it is a pure lie. It takes just one lie and the accused's innocent life is destroyed, no one believes them, and there are no consequences for the one who lied, because often if they \"retract\" the lie, nothing can be done to bring back truth and lost time, etc. that the innocent person with the horrible accusations had as a result of the false allegations against them. You do NOT want that for your son, nor you for that matter. I understand the girl had a terrible time prior to you taking her in; however she has to learn there are consequences to lieing. I also understand that this puts her back into a non stable situation, and she definitely needs help to process her life, her decisions, etc.  It takes JUST ONE accusation..... JUST ONE for your world to be turned upside down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Here, they would just shuffle her from foster home to foster home. The girl doesn't know what a stabil relationship is supposed to look like. She is extremely vulnerable.

She likely also needs significant therapy which might or might not include medications.", "England and it\u2019s the equivalent to putting her in emergency housing due to the safeguarding verification level I have.

Uhhh hello then test the evidence! What the cops mean by that phrase is we don't believe you. \n\nI myself was raped last yr by my ex and reported it.

Just ask my old foster carer that took me in at close to 4am one time, ironically from a runaway situation, known runaway who never stayed in one place long. Honestly go back 12year ago when things were more slack, I was staying with my friend and her mum, her mums a nurse, more qualified than you to care for people,it's her job, they still come and took me to emergency foster care.

You're saying OP should just be like, \"Oh honey, yes, for sure, I completely believe you will never pull that threat out again next time you get suitably upset\"?\n\nI want to help kids as much as the next person but there's zero chance I'm doing it at the risk of my kids' lives.

Make it plain and simple where you both stand. \n\nYou were obviously a pretty stable home for her and she probably felt she needed to test the boundaries cos it was getting \"too good to be true\"", "You should not have taken in a child you were not equipped to care for.

You've caused this girl a lot of additional trauma.", "NTA sometimes as much as you want to be there for someone and help them, you can\u2019t. you did the right thing in protecting your son and i truly hope she gets the help and patience she deserves", "YTA - Troubled kids are going to test boundaries to make sure you're not going to dump them as soon as it gets hard - because that's what every adult they have ever trusted has done to them. This is classic insecure attachment. I understand being concerned about accusations against your son but if documented and dealt with correctly - as the case worker was willing to support you with - this placement could be salvaged. You just confirmed her worst fears by reacting that way. As a teacher you really should have known better, you should have seen this scenario coming a mile away and been prepared to deal with it.", "YTA. What did you expect?? That this broken girl would suddenly become angelic because you graced her with your home and support for a couple of months? \n\nIf you have the training and knowledge you profess then this was the exact time when you shouldn't have reacted that way and kicked her out. \n\nSounds like you regretted your decision to help and saw an easy way out.", "Let\u2019s say she was your adopted daughter and did the same thing.

There are other ways to safeguard your son and you from false accusations that don't involve kicking this girl out.\n\nIe warning the police. Taping her admitting to false accusations. Asking your son to never be alone with her. Getting a camera for the living room. Warning social workers. Talking about the consequences of these actions.\n\nKids who have been through the kind of ordeals that this girl has gone through are desperately trying to understand their place in society and figure out if they are safe. It is entirely normal for them to be emotionally high strung, push boundaries and do things like this.\n\nThe way to solve this behavior is with child behavior specialists,  keeping firm boundaries  and showing love and respect.\n\nYou are not an arsehole for opening your home to a child in need. But YTA for giving this child the false hope that this time, it would be different. This time  someone would love her despite her being broken.", "Okay so this post didn't want to leave my mind so I have to give my comment here:\n\nI can't really give a clear judgement because it is simply too complex for a that. I simply want to give another perspective after reading a lot of the comments. Because the comments assume that this girl had the clarity and emotional maturity to be sure of what she's saying and that the consequence of being put in another home isn't that bad. \n\nFirst of all I want to touch upon the issue of her being a teenager. She is throwing a tantrum, that is not really unusual with teenagers and especially not about this specific topic like curfew and stuff. I would argue that most households have a least some fight about similar stuff. I remember when I was that age it was a tactic to argue with the leverage of my love for my parents. I said stuff like if you don't let me do X I will hate you forever, I will never talk with you again, you won't be my parents ever again! So this girl I assume knows that OP isn't gonna be swayed by such an argument because she is simply here for 4 months and yeah. So she has to have some other leverage and then again, she is a teenager and went through some pretty horrible stuff. OP didn't elaborate but I assume that she was abused at least physically maybe even sexually. So this girl's upbringing and especially her time living on the streets probably influenced how she talks and how she handles stuff. I can imagine that this way of talk, using false accusations of sexual harrassment as leverage for arguments and to get their will is maybe common where she grew up. \n\nHonestly I find it a bit overdramatic to call the cops ASAP. Because OP took this girl in so I assume she got good vibes from here and they kinda bonded because why should OP go through all this bureaucracy when not because she kinda bonds with this girl. I understand that OP wants the girl to see consequences and learn that words have meanings and that she can't say those words. And I think a stern talking and maybe even a visit to the authorities who handle cases like hers might be appropriate. It is also not clear if the girl was offered any psychological support because as OP said she went through a lot and this has a huge impact on her. From what OP told us, I assume the girl isn't completely 'lost' yet and while it may take some time and effort and psychological/professional help, I think one might get her on the right track. \n\nSo yeah, I think that OP might be at least a little bit of  a YTA, for calling the cops instead of calling her case worker and also for not at least trying to give her another chance. She did all that for this girl and she discards her the second she makes a mistake. Mind you she didn't really accuse her son in public and as OP also made clear she did it to get a reaction out of OP. She got the reaction and I think she learned her lesson. If OP really cares only a bit about this girl she sheltered for 4 months, she might at least try to get on the right track again. Because otherwise this girl most likely won't make it.", "Honestly I think YTA. You took in a trouble child and then kicked her out when she made a mistake. Which\u2026 trouble children do. I grew up in a very toxic and unstable house hold, and words really had no meaning. She probably did not understand that her statement was dangerous. You could have called her case worker, taken her to therapy, kept her separate from your son, worked on getting her into a different house, but instead you had the police drag her out in the middle of the night. Don\u2019t take in any more kids\u2026", "It was one mistake but it was a BADDDDDD one. I'm not sure you can trust her and your son is your priority.", "NTA, but maybe give her another chance with mediation? Look out for your son, but the whole story is documented so there is some protection for your son and you seem to have provided the only stability in this kid's life. She might be worth a second chance on the understanding that she has to cooperate.", "Idk how Foster care works where you are, but we're trained for this. If she's \"been through it\" and been through several homes, you were likely her best chance at real rehabilitation and family and you tossed her out after one mistake. This type of behaviour, while unpleasant, is not uncommon. As a general gist of what procedures are in place, Foster carers and bio kids have certain rules to follow like keeping bedroom doors open if together, spend more time in communal areas, and most importantly, carers write a daily record of what's gone on that day to basically cover your arse in case of accusations like this. The fact that she immediately apologised and expressed so much regret, with a serious conversation about how a threat like that could ruin OP's son's life and things around working together as a team, we're on the same side etc. signs are she would be really receptive. It would also be an incredible bonding moment, where you truly gain her trust and confidence. Imo, you blew it and did serious harm to the girl. She's not going to trust or open up to anyone any time soon. You wanted to help, but not enough. Could be lack of training and/or support but she wasn't some charity project for you to take in, gain brownie points and toss out at the first sign of trouble.

My family has been through something vaguely similar. A girl accused my middle brother of raping her when he actually didn\u2019t (they were both 17 at the time). She did it to get back at him because she wanted him to sneak her into my grandparents house, where he was living at the time, and he told her no. Well that wasn\u2019t good enough, so she went to see her ex-boyfriend, they had sex, and then she went to the police and got a rape kit done. The police then showed up at my grandma\u2019s house, searched through everything, questioned my brother, and my grandparents were mortified. My brother was so shaken and upset, it was horrible to experience. \n\nShe later confessed the ex boyfriend thing, and my brother was cleared through the results of the rape kit. Don\u2019t know what happened to her, but it affected my brother for a long time.\n\nProtect your son. If she threatened to do it now, she\u2019ll use it as ammunition in the future, cut your losses. I don\u2019t like saying that about a child, however, I\u2019ve seen what teenage girls are capable of, and you have to be careful. To protect your family, you made the right choice.", "Yes, YTA. You knew who she was. You knew what she'd been through. Fully informed, you took her in. *And then you betrayed her.*", "Will agree with the consensus of beyond the pay grade. \n\nBut I will say you saved you son from easiest one of the single scariest things a man/boy can go through and that is unfounded assault allegations.", "It's understandable you would protect your son above all else.\n\nAt the same time, this kid having \"been through it\", as you describe, was bound to display some problematic behaviour. If you truly want to help this kid, work with their caseworker to get them the therapy they need, whilst also setting some boundaries.\n\nI can't comment on this particular case for obvious reasons, but kids that have dealt with abuse often have issues with authorative parenting. So getting angry and \"laying down the law\", as it were, can trigger aggressive response. They often benefit from sitting down with them and calmly discussing why what they did was wrong, allowing them to come to the conclusion themselves. If showing love and understanding helps her see how hurtful what she did was, she will probably learn from her mistake. If she shows strong sociopathic tendencies, likely not.\n\nAll that said, if you decide you want to protect your son first and foremost, that is also a perfectly fine response. Sucks for the kid, but in the end she is less your responsibility than your son at this point.", "No, no, no. Do not let her come back.

It wasn't rational and obviously not ok, but she was basically trying to hear \"I want you here, no matter what\". \n\nTaking her back would be important for her developement and she will likely try to manipulate your relationship again to assure herself that you will stand by her. \n\nIt is completely understandable if you don't want to, but I'm guessing you could work with the social worker in terms of being open about the accusations she made and her admitting she made them out of anger to protect yourself and your son. \n\nShe needs to understand, that she put herself in a lot of danger by crying wolf about this, because nobody will believe her if it ever actually happens to her.

Enforcing a strict boundary like that on a child was the wrong approach and I think a less nuclear response to her threat would have been better.

Tbh what did you expect?", "Nope NTA as soon as she started to threaten to falsely tell police your son had assaulted her she\u2019s done.

She's probably been through a lot in life, especially at such a young age. And as a teacher, you have a really big heart for letting her into your home. \n\nYou are not wrong for having rules in your home. You had temporary guardianship over her, so it was your responsibility and obligation to press this situation. \n\nIt does not sound as if you are unreasonable. However, the threat of her accusing your son of essentially molesting/raping her is no \"small threat\".\n\nThat is your son, and as his parent you have a duty to protect your son. \nSure, maybe in a perfect world you guys could try again, but the world isn't perfect. \n\nYou should not feel guilty for protecting your son. \nYour son is innocent and does not deserve a potential false allegation (either now, or possibly in the future). \n\nYou can, however, feel sad for the girl. \nIt's not easy to see a child suffer like that.\n\nBut you did not do the wrong thing. \nYou are most definitely NOT the asshole.", "NTA - but it is sad that the kid figured out the 7 or 8 magic words that got all of humanity to shun a child \n\nThat kid didn\u2019t have a real concept of what she was saying, only that it was something \u201cbad\u201d \n\nIt was all of us, and our society that made things bad enough to *socially execute* a child for words alone \n\nBad things happen, sure, but is this kid the ringleader of those bad things?\n\nIt\u2019s a shit situation, for sure, but we need to reflect on how our own cesspool brought us here", "So to be fair. If she did make that allegation, they probably wouldn\u2019t have found it to be true and it still would have ended with her being taken from the home. The investigation would have just been asking your son if he did it.

She installed cameras in the house because the kids would make false accusations about her when they were upset.

You did what you had to do and you feel torn because you are a good person. Helping someone is admirable and encouraged, however, you also need to recognize when you're unable to do so. This young lady needs help from someone else. She needs therapy. It will take her awhile to get through it if she does pull through. As long as your son still stays with you it's best she does not stay with you at all.", "I feel as if there's a lot of context that is missing here. As in the child's past. It's very clear that the child is in extreme need of Therapy, Guidance, and Counseling. \n\nBefore I start, I'm going to immediately say NTA. \n\nAlthough what you were doing for the child was evidently beginning to form a healthier development, it is unacceptable to even come up with the idea of false sexual allegations. I've known many people who've taken their own life due to these allegations. Even when completely proven innocent. Even when the false victim announced that it was a lie. Once those allegations come out, the damage is irreparable. I don't want to dig too much into it-- Bottom line, it's beyond unacceptable in any way, shape, or form. Even an empty threat is crossing the line.\n\nAs for the future of the child, I wouldn't blame you for not taking in the child again. What you were doing for them was already the epitome of human kindness. I wouldn't want to be paid back for my kindness in such a way either. I honestly think it's a good thing that you've chosen to distance yourself for the sake of your son.\n\nHowever, if you feel as if the child can have a turnaround, and you decide to give them another chance, I would suggest you deeply speak to, and utilize your resources. Ensure that the child understands the consequences of such things, the damage that it causes, etc. and have them on a tight rope in terms of attendance of Therapy. \nAs for you, attend Parental Counseling to see what you can do to prevent the child from sinking back into a hole again. Because the child showing up late like that could've been a sign that they ran into an \"old friend.\" Just something to throw out there. \n\nThis whole situation is an extremely heavy one. Even saying that is putting it lightly. Whatever you choose to do, just know that you are NTA. Good luck. I hope for the best outcome for you and your son.\n\n(Edit: Grammatical errors)", "Some cases are beyond one's level of expertise. You tried to help that girl for as long as you could then she decided to test your boundaries for seemingly senseless reasons and in such a way that it endangered your son's life, your family and possibly yours if she continued in her behavior.\n\nYou did the best you could, again this behavior was beyond what you could do as a normal family. Unfortunately this child belongs in a group home with care people properly trained in such behavior.\n\nThere's an expert (Gabor Mat\u00e9) who says that a child acting out is actually acting what they couldn't tell with words. This is easy to say but when you are faced with that type of situation without having professional social worker /crisis caseload agent training, experience and skills, it's another thing that could really become out of hand.\n\nSo you're NTA obviously but then that child even at 14 probably has less emotional maturity that a normal 14 years old child does who comes from a normal, well balanced family. So that was clearly beyond what you and your family setting could offer. \n\nBut you cared. And still do, from what you say. What about keeping s link with that child? Keeping in contact, by writing maybe. She's an abandoned child who has no stable attachment ties. You and your family probably were the first in a long time, if not forever, to offer her stable caring connection and boundaries. Something extremely precious in a person's life that she probably has never known in her entire life.\n\nIf you could find a way, and find it within yourself, to keep being that good, stable family tie that is still caring and keeping in touch even from a distance, and that she never had before in her entire life, you could probably make an enormous difference in her life, while respecting your capabilities and your family's boundaries, keeping in mind that she probably acted out not out of spite and badness but out of her hurt, acting out again the abandonment she has been through so many times before.\n\nAnyways, many congratulations for what you tried to do for her on the spot when you found her. Not many people raise to the occasion like you did. You are very good people and will grow fantastic citizens from your children. \ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f", "N T A\n\nholy shit the can of worms she could have potentially opened with that lie.

It sounds like apart from this things were actually going pretty well and 2. immediately after she was asked if the allegations were true she backpedaled and admitted she was just angry. And considering what she's gone through it's unlikely she'd be able to act like a normal kid in stressful situations so blurting out shit like that is probably all she knows how to do. And I think the fact that she was able to identify that she said it out of anger and not double down shows she has some awareness that a lot of other kids like her lack.  I mean teenagers blurt out psychotic shit even in the most stable homes.\n\nBUT: Ultimately it comes down to this: if op took her back there is a chance it could improve or not happen again, especially if she got therapy, and by sending her back to the police she will only spiral downwards while she could have had a chance with OP that she likely won't get again.

It's most likely that even if there is an ending where she gets her life together and flourishes that the road to that end will mean dealing with, enduring, and helping her process through outbursts like this. She could even impulsively spit out accusations to proper authorities in a moment of anger and now OP or her family are in a fresh new kind of hell.\n\nThis is a HUGE risk to take and it's A LOT of work. This girl probably needs more attention than her own child so it's understandable that OP would not want to take this on.\n\nThere is no black and white YTA NTA answer here", "Agreed. At best I would say if she wants to stay, she needs counselling. Also understanding actions have consequences.
