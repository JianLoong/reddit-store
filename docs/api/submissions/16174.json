She stood out because it was too late to be alone, still in uniform on a school night & it was freezing. \n\nI approached her, asked if she was ok & she said yes. I didn\u2019t want to leave her alone so I sent my son to talk to her. Guessing it was easier to talk to someone her age but long story short, she\u2019s a runaway. As a teacher I\u2019m aware of safeguarding procedure so made the relevant phone calls & as I have the necessary credentials, police cleared me to take her home for the night.\n\nTurns out her case is familiar to the police & she\u2019s also run away from several homes they\u2019ve placed her in. We spoke a lot & she confided in me the details she didn\u2019t share with my son. I won\u2019t elaborate but she\u2019s been through it. \n\nI felt sorry for her & after a lot of paperwork, I was granted temporary guardianship which the courts were thrilled with because she hasn\u2019t stayed anywhere else more than a week. \n\nShe was with me for around 4 months before the incident occurred. She got home very late on a school night & I told her this was unacceptable. She threw a tantrum & said I\u2019m not her parent, she\u2019ll just leave. I told her although I can\u2019t force her to stay, while she\u2019s under my roof, the household rules have to be followed. Not just because I said so, but for her safety. Bear in mind we\u2019re dealing with a child who came home with me after meeting me in a park, so not the most streetwise. (Obvs didn\u2019t say that).\n\nShe shouted & argued back but I didn\u2019t respond. I\u2019m guessing she wanted a reaction out of me because with her next threat, she got it. She threatened to tell authorities my son had been inappropriate with her. I asked her if there was any truth to it to which she said no, apologised & said she was just angry. I\u2019ll be honest, after that I didn\u2019t hesitate to go to my room, call the police & have her removed from my custody. \n\nAs I called she overheard & started crying, apologising & begging me not to send her back. Ngl I t was hard to watch her get put in the police car while crying out to me.\n\nHer caseworker has since suggested we enter mediation & try again with the temporary guardianship as this is the most stable she\u2019s been in terms of school attendance, grades etc. As much as I\u2019d like to help her, I can\u2019t risk my son for her sake. \n\nMy friends have said it was cruel to give up after 1 mistake given she\u2019s been doing so well, & I\u2019m an ah for \u201ctossing\u201d her out.

And that hurts.", "NTA, she could destroy your lives with that kind of accusation against your son. She sounds like a very troubled kid and that's incredibly sad, but your family comes first.", "As you probably know, kids who have experienced trauma and neglect often lie so it's not at all unexpected that she lashed out in that way. That's probably all she has to fight back with when she feels cornered and unable to control emotions/impulses. A friend in high-school who was fostered would 'test' her foster parents for the first year or two to see what it would take for them to kick her out...in a way, she wanted proof they cared about her and wouldn't abuse her physically and this was her misguided way of seeking security. Once she felt safe/secure, it stopped. \n\nI can't imagine any teen with her history wouldn't come with their fair share of baggage so while her behaviour isn't unexpected, I understand your position in wanting to protect your son. I would have that as a concern also. If it got to the stage where she made an allegation to authorities...even if she recanted eventually, the experience would be pretty traumatic for your son either way and yes, you could potentially end up being blamed for bringing the girl into your home to begin with.\n\nIt's tricky. You probably need validation because you're feeling emotionally torn. Give it some time and discuss the situation with the case workers. Ultimately, your first responsibility it towards your own child and no one can blame you for that. You're not doing it because you can't be bothered or because you don't care...her comment triggered your protective instincts, justifiably.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s a threat she\u2019s prepared to use against your kid.

This wasn't only just a simple mistake, this was an accusation that can ruin a life. If she can't understand how unacceptable it was, it can never work out. \n\nJust make sure it's on record that she made this false accusation already. The impulsive nature of teenagers can make them do and say stupid things. But you definitely don't set a good example for your own kid by telling him there's no second chances in life, that you should always be defined by a single error in judgement. Maybe have a conversation with your son, doesn't hurt to get his input on the matter.", "This is way above the pay grade of AITA.  You need to talk to her case worker about her threat, what the risk is to your son, what the risk is to her.  She's obviously severely injured, there are no easy answers.  But right now, she's a teen girl who really needs some help, and what you've done has been working.  So see if you can figure out how to make it work.", "NTA. You took her in 4 months more than most people would have.", "NTA She's young & troubled but you have to protect your son from false accusations. She may try to use that again. It could take time & money to prove innocence from a false accusation. Being accused could stick with him through gossip and even paperwork. You tried and staying in her life as a friend may work. I feel bad for her and hope she does have a good future.", "NTA\n\nYou were blackmailed essentially into giving in or your son be put into the system for a sex crime the girl admitted never happened.  I have a friend whose brother almost was jailed for false claims. It took thousands and a courtroom to learn he was innocent. \n\nI feel for that girl.  Its a horrible reality she is in. Thats is no reason to give her a chance to destroy another child's life because she doesn't know consequences and integrity. \n\nYou did the correct thing immediately asking her if it was true. You then did the correct thing protecting your son.", "Tbh I see no asshole here. I get your stand and you are absolutely right for it. I also would not appreciate threats to my child in my house but I also think that her acting out was probably due to trauma. She probably felt safe in your house and got insecure about whether you may make her leave and thought that a threat may stabilize her position somewhat and as soon as it backfired she saw her mistake and apologized. I think that stuff needs to be talked through but the ultimate decision is yours to make and neither would be wrong to make.", "NTA - False accusations, in many ways, are more dangerous than true ones. True accusations can be dealt with, appropriate consequences determined, etc. False accusations empower the lair to continue with the lies as people tend to believe the accuser much much much more than the accused. That, of course, is great when the allegation is true, not so great when it is a pure lie. It takes just one lie and the accused's innocent life is destroyed, no one believes them, and there are no consequences for the one who lied, because often if they \"retract\" the lie, nothing can be done to bring back truth and lost time, etc. that the innocent person with the horrible accusations had as a result of the false allegations against them. You do NOT want that for your son, nor you for that matter. I understand the girl had a terrible time prior to you taking her in; however she has to learn there are consequences to lieing. I also understand that this puts her back into a non stable situation, and she definitely needs help to process her life, her decisions, etc.  It takes JUST ONE accusation..... JUST ONE for your world to be turned upside down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Here, they would just shuffle her from foster home to foster home. The girl doesn't know what a stabil relationship is supposed to look like. She is extremely vulnerable.

She likely also needs significant therapy which might or might not include medications.", "England and it\u2019s the equivalent to putting her in emergency housing due to the safeguarding verification level I have.

Uhhh hello then test the evidence! What the cops mean by that phrase is we don't believe you. \n\nI myself was raped last yr by my ex and reported it. The cops refused to take down a report let alone be present to collect the rape kit. Why because \"a husband can't rape his wife\".\n\nI was also raped when I was 12 by my stepfather no one believed me then because \"he was such a good provider\" for my biomom who supported him and said I was making it up when in reality she gave me to him trying to salvage her marriage. \n\nSo no really really no the accuser is almost always believed and given every benefit of the doubt. Both legally and socially. Almost all child rapists are the people you never think to worry about the people closest to you with access to your kid because you gave them that access. Most parents even initially even dismiss their child's first rumblings of not wanting to see uncle \"Roy anymore. Which leads kids to think they won't be believed if they tell you.", "You must not live in the US just the accusation can ruin someone\u2019s life..", "you do realize that an accusation like that could ruin her sons life right? even if she does own up to her lie later, something like that could do irreparable harm to his reputation. in a situation like that, allowing someone in your home that has shown they are willing to ruin your CHILDS life would be an AH move", "Yet, rather than pouring resources into an underfunded foster system, American states are wasting money and time debating about which restroom trans students should use", "> stuck between a rock and a hard place\n\n> also understandable to protect her son\n\nOP is living out the hypothetical about which child to save from a house fire: She chose her bio son of 13 years over her foster daughter of 4 months.\n\nI would have made the same choice\u2014no hesitation but all guilt\u2014so I vote NTA.", "I am just really surprised. I worked in child welfare in the US and this wouldn't happen. Cops don't even really get a say on where kids end up.", "You must not live in the usa where just uttering an accusation can ruin someone's life.", "I do and am well aware of how Americans are terrified of everything. It's already addressed above.", "Cops here would call cps, cps would make the determination of where the kids is going. They might be partial to someone open to taking in a known problem, I'm guessing this is probably in a smaller town."]}
