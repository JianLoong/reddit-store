If you use someones stuff, you should always treat it better than you treat your own items. Your sister or her friends weight/size really doesn't change the fact that she should have been responsible enough to heed your warnings, say thanks for the advice, and refilled the hot tub before she destroyed your parents property. Your mom needs to stop enabling her as she is a grown adult and needs to stand on her own.

With all of the 4 issues you listed, if someone is eating deliberately and properly will they still gain weight? I understand it might be harder to eat properly due to the issues, but if someone diets and monitors closely do they gain weight still?", "Odd because the word \"fat\" can be used in so many contexts like fat content in food, low fat, fat wad of cash, etc.", "Op said it was \"too many people regardless of size, because they are so big a huge amount of the water overflowed over the side.\"\n\nSo it was both that it was too many people, _and_ those people were too large, resulting in more water flowing out than if it had _just_ been too many people.", "But it does matter, because the same _number_ of people who were smaller in size would've resulted in less water getting out, because what matters is the _total volume_ of the bodies, not the number.", "yeah what caused the lack of water genius", ">but 1 more thin person would have also. \n\nIf for example 5 people were the advised limit of the hot tub, it likely used an average adult weight or a bit more than that to determine the limit. 6 slim people, especially with smaller women among them, should easily stay under that limit. \n\n>I'm saying an overflowing hot tub is a normal thing.\n\nIt doesn't sound like it ever happened before in their household and that is why the sister didn't listen to OP.

I guess reddit  auto deletes the comment for hate speech.

It riles up the people who hate fat people and it riles up everyone who points out, hey, you don't have to bring people's weight into it.

Could be a smaller hot tub, maybe they splashed a lot. There's a million reasons they could have caused it to overflow and none of them really matter to the story.
