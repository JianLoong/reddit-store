Your mom needs to release the her from her bosom. Your sister is a grown adult, you tried to give her a stern warning that she didn't heed and she damaged someone else's property (your Parents). I agree that you had the right to speak the truth just as your dad has the right to be pissed about it being broken and your mom coddling your sister. Your mom and sister are TA here. If you use someones stuff, you should always treat it better than you treat your own items. Your sister or her friends weight/size really doesn't change the fact that she should have been responsible enough to heed your warnings, say thanks for the advice, and refilled the hot tub before she destroyed your parents property. Your mom needs to stop enabling her as she is a grown adult and needs to stand on her own.  The least your sister should do is get a part time job and fix the hot tub for your dad asap, or pay him back for the damage as he will have to get it fixed for his own health.", "NTA, but is the pump motor actually broken, or is the problem just the tripped circuit breaker? From your interaction with your sister, it sounds like resetting the circuit breaker after topping up the water would have solved the problem, but she wouldn't listen to you. Then your dad found the pump was actually broken (i.e., even resetting the circuit breaker wouldn't help until you fix the motor). Which is it?", "OP NTA.\n\nIf a device is broken, the best way to find out how to fix it is by telling what happened to it. This is exactly what you did.\n\nYour father has a medical reason to use the hot tub, which is in every way more important than your sisters self esteem or feelings.\n\nYou even told here it would break down if she did not fill it up. Sister is the TA and your mother is pretty close to it as well.\n\nYour sister should've just been honest to your father which she didn't. Hopefully your father is able to fix it soon enough.", ">My mom is so freaked out about my sisters self esteem\n\nThis is the 'actual problem' where people will deny reality to live in denial.\n\nYour sister sucks, and even chose to lie about something you tried to help her prevent, while being obnoxious toward you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nIn this instance, all OP did was tell the truth. I would wager there is a long list of other times OP was being a jerk just to spite his sister. This is not one of those times.", "NTA.  There\u2019s a nasty family dynamic going on here where your mother\u2019s coddling is preventing your sister from developing any resilience.  She has to take responsibility for her actions.  Stay away from the \u201cf**\u201d word, though.  You didn\u2019t need to say that in order to tell what happened.  I\u2019m not even sure why the word is masked, unless there really is that much shame in it.", "NTA - maybe poor tact but you are 17 to be fair. Also, if u wrote the truth, you called sisters FRIENDS fat not her (specifically thicc), but that might not make a difference to anyone deciding in your actual situation", "\u201cBut I\u2019m running out of room\u201d NTA, but that line was a set up to a joke and you know it.", "NTA... Barely. Your sister didn't care to listen enough to you warning her, then tried to shift the blame. If she'd owned up to it or listening in the first place it wouldn't haven't been brought up at all.\n\nYou could have said it more delicately though.", "NTA \n\nThen being fat has nothing to do with it. Could you have been nicer? Yes, so you have to? Nope.\n\nIt would have been no different if they were splashing and water spiked out significantly. \n\nYou told her the problem and how to fix it and she blew you off. Tell your mom that if she\u2019s her favorite, just say that, but stop with the bullshit.", "ESH Obviously your sister is an AH for breaking the hot tub and lying about it. It was justified for you to call out her lie. She had it coming, especially since your dad uses it to manage back pain. \n\nBut you didn\u2019t need to call her friends (and her?) fat in doing so. You could have simply said they made the water overflow without mentioning anything about their weight.", "ESH. The fact that you won\u2019t even type \u201cfat\u201d sealed the deal for me. If you think it\u2019s so offensive that you can\u2019t write it out, you clearly meant it in the worst possible way.\n\nYou can tell your parents what really happened without resorting to personal attacks. Because it doesn\u2019t actually matter how the water got displaced. That happens when people splash a lot, too, or if there are a lot of people in there at once.\n\nThe point is that the water level was too low when they left, you told your sister to refill it, and she didn\u2019t. End of story.\n\nYour sister sucks for breaking it, obviously.\n\nBut you also purposefully didn\u2019t tell her about the breaker or give your dad a heads up that something he needs for his condition was broken. You hate your sister more than you care about your dad\u2019s comfort. That\u2019s not great. Get some therapy.", "YTA:  This sentence and activity would have been fine if you didn't attack them (calling them fat) personally in the middle of it.  \n\n> My sister lied to him and said that it was just like that and even she and her friends didn\u2019t get to use it.
