If you use someones stuff, you should always treat it better than you treat your own items. Your sister or her friends weight/size really doesn't change the fact that she should have been responsible enough to heed your warnings, say thanks for the advice, and refilled the hot tub before she destroyed your parents property. Your mom needs to stop enabling her as she is a grown adult and needs to stand on her own.

Step sister said it wasn't fair, and someone, not Op, said its not their fault she's fat ordered enough for two, and Op agreed.\n\nSo many people in the thread were acting as if this was the worst thing you could _possibly_ do to a person, and that Op was horrible for the fat shaming.\n\nMeanwhile, I was sitting there thinking that the step sister is clearly a manipulative asshole trying to scam money out of her friends.
