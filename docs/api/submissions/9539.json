Only invited people both me and my fianc\u00e9 know well, there are no plus ones, only named invitees. So some new partners aren\u2019t invited. But long-standing ones we know well are. My male cousin took offence to this, he has been with his gf just over 6 months, we have never met her. I grew up with this cousin and was quite close, though don\u2019t see each other that often now due to job demands. He told his mum (my auntie) when he received the invite \u201ctell her I\u2019m not going if gf isn\u2019t.\u201d My auntie told my mum, who told me. \n\nI reached out to him after some Reddit advice asking to talk, got left on read. texted a few days later \u201cjust let me know when works for you\u201d as a reminder, left on read. When it became clear I wasn\u2019t gonna get a response I texted \u201cI\u2019m really sorry if your feelings have been hurt, I\u2019d love us to be able to talk about it &come to an understanding\u201d. Nothing, so I left it.  \n\nSo last week, RSVP deadline approaching. This cousin is one of 6 - older bro & sis,1 younger sis who is a bridesmaid aged 15, and younger twin bros. I sent his older brother (again, a cousin I\u2019ve been really close with) a gentle reminder to rsvp, he replied straight away saying oh yeah. I then asked if his bro was ok as hadn\u2019t heard from him. Then this cousin launches into a whole rant about how he is totally on his brothers side, I\u2019ve really upset him, that if his brother isn\u2019t going neither is he and his gf (of 10 years). I was distraught. Sent screenshots to my mum who was trying to calm me down and said forget about it, if they don\u2019t want to come that\u2019s on them. Then I start thinking, will older sis come. She was the only one on that side of the fam to RSVP so far and said yes. So again, I sent a text saying hi, just wanted to double check, I\u2019ve heard cousin A and B aren\u2019t coming because we can\u2019t invite cousins gf. As you\u2019ve already RSVPed I just wanted to check you\u2019re coming even if they aren\u2019t? To which I got a similarly upsetting reply about how horrible I\u2019d been not inviting her, she\u2019s totally on her bros side but still wanted to come to see her little sis be a bridesmaid. \n\nI\u2019d kept it together all day but I erupted in tears. sent screenshots to my mum who replied saying she is absolutely raging and is uninviting the entire lot of them and not to engage with them. The older female cousin texted my mum to \u201cgrow up\u201d. I got sent home from work on compassionate leave a mess - my dad picked me up.\n\nSo here\u2019s where IMBTA. My 15F cousin, who has no involvement, will now have been told from her mum she\u2019s not a bridesmaid, not going, and I feel SO BAD. I love her and she\u2019s done nothing wrong. She was excited to be one. I was thinking about reaching out to say as far as I\u2019m concerned she can still be one - but in truth I don\u2019t think her mum would let her anymore and it just feels like completely unfair collateral damage. But this is really hanging over me. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT #1: so everyone seems to be passing judgement on whether or not I was wrong to not invite my cousins girlfriend. Which was not the point of the post. If you would desperately like to pass judgement on that, please see my previous AITA post and go crazy.  I am really just wondering on what Reddit thinks about the situation with my little cousin.", "created_utc": 1675958385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xy9iu/aita_for_letting_my_mum_go_nuclear_on_her_sisters/", "score": 296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've never met his girlfriend, and she's been a rather recent addition to the family - of less than a year. It seems like he took it as a slight to her, and the rest of your cousin's family as well, the underlying idea being that she's already family. And yes, sure, she may be close to them, but that doesn't make them family to you - not yet. \n\nI feel like half of this could have been avoided if you could had got across your cousin's thick skull that you do understand he cares about her, but that you can't afford to invite people you don't know to your own wedding.

I mean, I get she's important, but was her not being invited worth cutting you off like that ? The reaction seems pretty exaggerated.\n\nBut frankly, while I understand your mum being upset, her own rage-induced revenge was really unhelpful. She just threw fire to the flames and started a civil war, which isn't likely to stop soon because you sound like a stubborn bunch.\n\nBut OP, are hurt feelings worth cutting ties with people who clearly matter to you ? Over a wedding invitation to a plus one, no less ? I mean, that's a question only you can answer.\n\nBut if you *do* care about them enough, take up your phone. Call your aunt first, maybe. Tell her all of this is stupid - are we really going to stop talking after decades of love and friendship, all for a petty misunderstanding ? Avoid saying anything bad about the girlfriend, they'll be on the lookout for clues they're right about this. But repeat to her you simply *can't* afford the plus one, it wasn't meant to disrespect her link to the family.\n\nAlso, I think that if you only talk to the 15-year old girl to explain to her she's still welcome to your wedding, you can say goodbye about your other cousins and maybe your aunt.\n\nUp to you to see if it's worth the gamble.", "NTA.

It wasn't like you were going to change your mind.", "I think you just wanted a chance to justify your choice and hear him say \u201cit\u2019s ok\u201d. It wasn\u2019t ok to him. That\u2019s it. You pushed without any plan of considering why the etiquette generally expects a plus-one for guests.", "Why? Apparently everyone thought that she should be invited per the post", "It means a message passed from person to with the original message becoming corrupted with each telling. Maybe akin to 'lost in translation' but not quite the same.  I have no idea why it's called that, but that's what it means.", "It\u2019s a really common British phrase - and also a kids game. But as some people weren\u2019t sure what it meant (assuming not British themselves so had never heard it) I removed it in case it caused offence.", "Ok, so let me get this right. You hosted an event at your house and set the invite list. Your father had some comments about who should and shouldn\u2019t have been invited. You ignored those comments because you were the host, and you had who you did and didn\u2019t want there. Am I getting that correct? Is that not exactly what me and fianc\u00e9 have done", "And a girlfriend of 6 months is not family.", "I agree. But they very nicely told me exactly what they thought about me and \u201cmy decision\u201d and told me I needed to \u201cthink about my relationship with all of them if I don\u2019t let her come\u201d, basically trying to guilt trip me. Decline the RSVP, that\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t need to give a reason, j didn\u2019t ask for one. But they gave me it anyway, and it was pretty harsh.", "They can do that, but things you are allowed to do can still make you an AH. I can walk down the street yelling obscenities at people I pass. It\u2019s legal, but I\u2019d be an AH.\n\nCousin doesn\u2019t want to come because his GF isn\u2019t invited? Fine. Cousin maybe even being a little upset about that? Fine.\n\nCousin refusing to speak to OP about it and all of the other cousins lashing out? They\u2019re AHs.", "No I just wanted to talk and for both sides to be aired, because the only communication about it had been via our mothers.", "Obviously you have the right to make the final decision. That's what I said in my original comment, and I did *not* vote that you were TA. I'm saying that some invitation decisions seem more gracious than others, and I'm making a recommendation. A decision can be more or less gracious without veering into AH territory. My recommendation (in both my case and yours, I feel that you're remiss in setting this up as a false equivalence) is to err on the side of making the invitations a little more comforting to the guests at the price of a small sacrifice to the \"main person.\"", "Fair. That said, did you actually\nPlan to come to an understanding as in a compromise? Or did you just want to reiterate why that was the plan? \n\nEither way. No one behaved well here."]}
