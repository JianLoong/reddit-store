Only invited people both me and my fianc\u00e9 know well, there are no plus ones, only named invitees. So some new partners aren\u2019t invited. But long-standing ones we know well are. My male cousin took offence to this, he has been with his gf just over 6 months, we have never met her. I grew up with this cousin and was quite close, though don\u2019t see each other that often now due to job demands. He told his mum (my auntie) when he received the invite \u201ctell her I\u2019m not going if gf isn\u2019t.\u201d My auntie told my mum, who told me. \n\nI reached out to him after some Reddit advice asking to talk, got left on read. texted a few days later \u201cjust let me know when works for you\u201d as a reminder, left on read. When it became clear I wasn\u2019t gonna get a response I texted \u201cI\u2019m really sorry if your feelings have been hurt, I\u2019d love us to be able to talk about it &come to an understanding\u201d. Nothing, so I left it.  \n\nSo last week, RSVP deadline approaching. This cousin is one of 6 - older bro & sis,1 younger sis who is a bridesmaid aged 15, and younger twin bros. I sent his older brother (again, a cousin I\u2019ve been really close with) a gentle reminder to rsvp, he replied straight away saying oh yeah. I then asked if his bro was ok as hadn\u2019t heard from him. Then this cousin launches into a whole rant about how he is totally on his brothers side, I\u2019ve really upset him, that if his brother isn\u2019t going neither is he and his gf (of 10 years). I was distraught. Sent screenshots to my mum who was trying to calm me down and said forget about it, if they don\u2019t want to come that\u2019s on them. Then I start thinking, will older sis come. She was the only one on that side of the fam to RSVP so far and said yes. So again, I sent a text saying hi, just wanted to double check, I\u2019ve heard cousin A and B aren\u2019t coming because we can\u2019t invite cousins gf. As you\u2019ve already RSVPed I just wanted to check you\u2019re coming even if they aren\u2019t? To which I got a similarly upsetting reply about how horrible I\u2019d been not inviting her, she\u2019s totally on her bros side but still wanted to come to see her little sis be a bridesmaid. \n\nI\u2019d kept it together all day but I erupted in tears. sent screenshots to my mum who replied saying she is absolutely raging and is uninviting the entire lot of them and not to engage with them. The older female cousin texted my mum to \u201cgrow up\u201d. I got sent home from work on compassionate leave a mess - my dad picked me up.\n\nSo here\u2019s where IMBTA. My 15F cousin, who has no involvement, will now have been told from her mum she\u2019s not a bridesmaid, not going, and I feel SO BAD. I love her and she\u2019s done nothing wrong. She was excited to be one. I was thinking about reaching out to say as far as I\u2019m concerned she can still be one - but in truth I don\u2019t think her mum would let her anymore and it just feels like completely unfair collateral damage. But this is really hanging over me. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT #1: so everyone seems to be passing judgement on whether or not I was wrong to not invite my cousins girlfriend. Which was not the point of the post. If you would desperately like to pass judgement on that, please see my previous AITA post and go crazy.  I am really just wondering on what Reddit thinks about the situation with my little cousin.", "created_utc": 1675958385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xy9iu/aita_for_letting_my_mum_go_nuclear_on_her_sisters/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The inviting guests is the celebration silly. \n\nIf it's just about you and your to be spouse, elope.", "Yes it is.", "Ok, then that cousin sucks too. It doesn\u2019t make your behavior ok. Why would you even broach this topic with her, especially while at work? Your original cousin is really hurt and you issued a non-apology. You should have left it there. \n\nI hope all of this has blown over before your June wedding and that you enjoy celebrating with your guests.", "I\u2019ve tried. He will not engage. And I\u2019m not just going to turn up at his door and demands he speaks to me. This thing has blown up because of all the Chinese whispers and him getting his mother to tell me things rather than come and speak to me himself, and then blank all my efforts for an adult conversation.", "I don\u2019t know whether the situation is too far gone now. But I definitely want a relationship with my little cousin, which is the point of my post.", "She has a right to invite people that she knows. Are you or her cousins family gonna foot for the party and any costs? No? Then your comment was hella out of pocket and rude af. Grow up because I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a teenager who is trying to act grown on a thread of AITA.", "No shes not.\n\nThis is such a reasonable request its mind blowing people are overreacting to it", "> Am SO of 6 months? Nope that ain\u2019t it fam.\n\nMaybe, I dunno.  People have got married in shorter times, I don't think anyone else gets to dictate when the threshold has been reached when a relationship is long enough to only go places with a +1.  \n\n>accepted that long term partners have a better standing over new ones.\n\nBut that's not what anyone's saying, it's not \"over others\" but \"included with others\".  I don't think cousin expected older standing partners to be dropped for his gf.....\n\nRegardless, Op is NTA and cousin should have politley declined without causing drama if it bothered him.  You're right he didn't handle it like a grown up.", "Yeah, that was a bit much for the extra drama.  Weddings certainly bring out the best of people. \n\nAs I said, I would consider not going if my SO wasn't invited, but I also would not want my entire family to essentially bully you about your wedding.\n\nI made similar cuts as you did during my wedding.  Fallout and Drama was about the same, it just comes with the territory I think, can't keep everyone happy, so just try to make sure you are.", "Again, this is such a strange take. It's her family. Families have problems sometimes. Are you suggesting people cut contact after every argument forever?", "I reached out to his brother I didn\u2019t even realise had a take on this to remind them to rsvp!! Then innocently asked if my cousin was ok as he\u2019d been ignoring me, expecting my cousin to just say to give him some time or something. Not this", "I think OP needed to know because they hadn\u2019t RSVP\u2019d either yes or no. And you kinda need those numbers by a certain date to give to your caterer and venue.", "So what about the cousin that rsvp'd yes but then changed her mind because of her brother? She hadn't updated op so clearly it was a good job that op reached out to ask", "\u2026yes? Is there a point?", "That\u2019s exactly the one that she\u2019s upset about.", "They don\u2019t live far from the venue at all so actually it would be really simple for someone (my mum, myself, etc) to go and fetch her if need be, and we would happily pay for her to stay the night, or take her home if she prefers", "Yes, if you read my post you\u2019ll learn that that is exactly the judgement and advice I was looking for. But my friends are divided on whether reaching out may cause round 2.", "Very true, thanks for your input.", "Why is it a dick move to have a small wedding with only people you actually know there? I genuinely don\u2019t get this.", "Since when is there a \u201cwrong\u201d way to get married? We have budget restriction and venue capacity restrictions that meant we couldn\u2019t invite every single person we knew, plus the fact we wanted an intimate wedding with just our closest people. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m getting married wrong. Nor is that the part of the post I was seeking judgement for, thanks.", "\u201cChinese whispers?\u201d I\u2019ve never heard that term. Are you Chinese?", "That may well not be an option unless you can talk to her directly. \n\nAs I've said, you need to talk face to face, not over texts or WhatsApp or whatever.", "I think the person paying for the wedding gets to dictate what the \u201cthreshold\u201d is.  You think if I asked people, \u201coh do you think you\u2019ve been with your partner long enough to invite them to the wedding?\u201d anyone is gonna say no? I can\u2019t afford to have every single person there, and I don\u2019t want to. I wanted it intimate and private. And now it\u2019s just because this whole massive family rift and I\u2019m just in shock", "Nothing like a wedding to ruin a family, hey", "I didn't say cut contact. I said quit reaching out to argue because some people that you invited to your party don't want to come. \n\nOP made her decision about the guest list. Other people get to make their decisions about attending or not. OP is reaching out because she's now realized there are consequences to her decision about not giving the plus-one. \n\nSame as when there's a destination wedding, a childfree wedding, etc. Some invitees will not attend. Bride/groom have to accept it.", "Point being you don't have to chase anyone for a reply.", "You knew the cousin/Aunt were mad already. You already made your decision about no plus-one for the cousin, so what was your reason to reach and out discuss anything? \n\nYou made your decision about the guest list, but you don't want to accept their decision about not attending. You want to argue and convince them you're right and they should still come.", "Then why cry when people dont come? Now the wedding is even smaller", "You can have a small wedding. \n\nInviting 1st and 2nd cousins  and then Specifically barring +1 is not a small wedding. \n\nYou should have keep the invitations to just direct relatives if you wanted a small wedding.\n\nCreating hard feelings with these people will last forever.\n.", "Hey OP, the person you are responding to is 100% wrong. Your marriage is between you and your SO, no one else. Whomever you decide to share this event with is up to you. If you don't want virtual strangers there, it is your prerogative. If someone doesn't want to come because of your rules, it is their prerogative. But this group of family is out of line requiring you to include a stranger in your wedding to placate a 6 month relationship.\n\nNTA", "There are right ways to do things. \n\nThis is not that way. \n\nIf you have venue capacity or budget constraints,  you should have planned smaller circles. \n\nNot attending a wedding with a spouse,  espically for people who would be traveling far distances is uncommon. \n\nYes this was within the scope of your post.", ">I think the person paying for the wedding gets to dictate what the \u201cthreshold\u201d is\n\nno no, you misunderstood.  The person paying for the wedding absolutely gets to dictate the threshold of who makes the cut, no question there.\n\nThe partner of the individual being cut, gets to decide if the threshold has been met for them to be offended enough to not go without their partner.\n\n>anyone is gonna say no?\n\nOf course not, you need to just make that decision yourself.  But part of making that decision is understanding some people will be offended and upset.  It is unavoidable.\n\n> can\u2019t afford to have every single person there, and I don\u2019t want to\n\nRight, that sounds fair to me.\n\nWas this cousin the only one on his side of the family denied an invite for their partner?", "Um.. yeah, I sent 1 reminder to people the week before the deadline (as there was a long time from receiving the invites to the deadline, about 7 weeks) which is when this all erupted again, because the situation deviated when I asked if my cousin my okay.  So by your standards above I did it right, and truly do not see the relevance ti this and the situation with my little cousin. But ok", "As I said in my post. The RSVP deadline was approaching, and I had not heard from most of them, so I sent a gentle reminder and that\u2019s how it all resurfaced.", "She\u2019s upset that her cousin is being excluded, even though she wants to come and OP wants her to come too.", "Because the people are being unreasonable?", "Traditionally, +1s aren\u2019t even supposed to be a thing to begin with. It was never expected that anyone would invite someone they didn\u2019t know to their wedding. If you\u2019re not close enough to know their name, you\u2019re not close enough to be obligated to invite them.", "They live 15 minutes way from the venue. What do you mean I \u201cshould have planned for smaller circles\u201d", "Again, a girlfriend of 6 months not a spouse.", " You are receiving a lot of negative criticism; I think this part of the convo was meant to point out that you are going above and beyond in some areas to keep the drama going but that isn't what it looks like to me.  \n\nYou are so buried in this by now, try to read the advice and take a breath.  You might be able to resolve it if you are willing to compromise some, and that might be worth it in the future.", "Then she should blame her mother who univited the whole family", "Apparently you are not very familiar with tradition. The traditional wedding in the USA is an invitation goes to a family, that family is invited.  Lately the adults only portion of the family has become an invitation strategy.   Not traditional.   Inviting just the named guest is not traditional,  though it is done now days. \n\n\nPerhaps this particular situation is a cultural variation, that was not explained in the intro."]}
