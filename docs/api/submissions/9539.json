{"id": 9539, "submission_id": "10xy9iu", "title": "AITA for letting my mum go nuclear on her sisters family and causing collateral damage?", "selftext": "Important context: getting married this summer. Only invited people both me and my fianc\u00e9 know well, there are no plus ones, only named invitees. So some new partners aren\u2019t invited. But long-standing ones we know well are. My male cousin took offence to this, he has been with his gf just over 6 months, we have never met her. I grew up with this cousin and was quite close, though don\u2019t see each other that often now due to job demands. He told his mum (my auntie) when he received the invite \u201ctell her I\u2019m not going if gf isn\u2019t.\u201d My auntie told my mum, who told me. \n\nI reached out to him after some Reddit advice asking to talk, got left on read. texted a few days later \u201cjust let me know when works for you\u201d as a reminder, left on read. When it became clear I wasn\u2019t gonna get a response I texted \u201cI\u2019m really sorry if your feelings have been hurt, I\u2019d love us to be able to talk about it &come to an understanding\u201d. Nothing, so I left it.  \n\nSo last week, RSVP deadline approaching. This cousin is one of 6 - older bro & sis,1 younger sis who is a bridesmaid aged 15, and younger twin bros. I sent his older brother (again, a cousin I\u2019ve been really close with) a gentle reminder to rsvp, he replied straight away saying oh yeah. I then asked if his bro was ok as hadn\u2019t heard from him. Then this cousin launches into a whole rant about how he is totally on his brothers side, I\u2019ve really upset him, that if his brother isn\u2019t going neither is he and his gf (of 10 years). I was distraught. Sent screenshots to my mum who was trying to calm me down and said forget about it, if they don\u2019t want to come that\u2019s on them. Then I start thinking, will older sis come. She was the only one on that side of the fam to RSVP so far and said yes. So again, I sent a text saying hi, just wanted to double check, I\u2019ve heard cousin A and B aren\u2019t coming because we can\u2019t invite cousins gf. As you\u2019ve already RSVPed I just wanted to check you\u2019re coming even if they aren\u2019t? To which I got a similarly upsetting reply about how horrible I\u2019d been not inviting her, she\u2019s totally on her bros side but still wanted to come to see her little sis be a bridesmaid. \n\nI\u2019d kept it together all day but I erupted in tears. sent screenshots to my mum who replied saying she is absolutely raging and is uninviting the entire lot of them and not to engage with them. The older female cousin texted my mum to \u201cgrow up\u201d. I got sent home from work on compassionate leave a mess - my dad picked me up.\n\nSo here\u2019s where IMBTA. My 15F cousin, who has no involvement, will now have been told from her mum she\u2019s not a bridesmaid, not going, and I feel SO BAD. I love her and she\u2019s done nothing wrong. She was excited to be one. I was thinking about reaching out to say as far as I\u2019m concerned she can still be one - but in truth I don\u2019t think her mum would let her anymore and it just feels like completely unfair collateral damage. But this is really hanging over me. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT #1: so everyone seems to be passing judgement on whether or not I was wrong to not invite my cousins girlfriend. Which was not the point of the post. If you would desperately like to pass judgement on that, please see my previous AITA post and go crazy.  I am really just wondering on what Reddit thinks about the situation with my little cousin.\n\nEDIT #2: I messaged my cousin and I don\u2019t know if I feel better or worse, I just feel apprehensive. I told her any choice is absolutely ok and she doesn\u2019t even have to reply to me if she doesn\u2019t want to. I told my mum and she thinks I shouldn\u2019t be contacting any of them including her, as she\u2019s a child, but it\u2019s been playing on my mind all week. My mum said she \u201cknows how this works and it\u2019s never straightforward\u201d so has advised I don\u2019t reply to any messages from any of them and don\u2019t reach out. But I felt so bad about my little cousin. :/", "created_utc": 1675958385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xy9iu/aita_for_letting_my_mum_go_nuclear_on_her_sisters/", "score": 1840, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And OP had reached out multiple times for this said cousin to talk like a freakin adult. And then this family decides to go nuclear on a very simple request?

You don\u2019t want to invite +1s, you don\u2019t have to. However, if you won\u2019t, you should assume you\u2019re going to lose people\u2014as you did and as your cousins could fairly do. However they\u2019re kind of assholes for getting indignant about it. Fine if they want to decline, but that 6 month GF is not entitled to an invitation. \n\nHowever your bridesmaid cousin did nothing wrong and her mom is an asshole for taking her out. I suspect the mom orchestrated the whole thing. However you aren\u2019t the asshole for that since you\u2019re not the one who did that and didn\u2019t do anything wrong otherwise.", "ESH. You got your answer the first time he didn't reply. It was pretty much confirmed the second time you got left on read. So I don't know how you ended up \"distraught\"\n\nAs they say its your wedding, and I understand the rules you put in places on invites considering the amount of money you're putting into it.

How did you think it was going to go? You can reach out to the 15 year old but she is not coming without her family. \nI said this before and I say it again: we see all these posts everyday about AITA for excluding kids, spouses, gf\u2019s or bf\u2019s, etc. from my wedding. No you aren\u2019t. But be prepared for half your family and friends to be pissed at you about it.", "Let's have a look.\n\nYour cousin definitely opened up the hostility, in my opinion. It's very understandable you can't really invite people you don't know to your wedding, *especially* considering your partner has 5 siblings. Heck, my parents couldn't invite all their uncles and aunts at their own wedding. \n\nI am not sure I understand why he was so upset. You've never met his girlfriend, and she's been a rather recent addition to the family - of less than a year. It seems like he took it as a slight to her, and the rest of your cousin's family as well, the underlying idea being that she's already family. And yes, sure, she may be close to them, but that doesn't make them family to you - not yet. \n\nI feel like half of this could have been avoided if you could had got across your cousin's thick skull that you do understand he cares about her, but that you can't afford to invite people you don't know to your own wedding. However, you'd be more than happy to share something with her and your cousins in the future.\n\nBut well, you tried to reach out to him very politely and he deliberately ignored you. Okay, he was hurt or irritated, but *so were you*, and he refused to even talk it out with you even if you're close. That's pretty immature behaviour, in my opinion.\n\nOkay so then all the cousins and even the aunt side with the new girlfriend - what is she, a witch ? I mean, I get she's important, but was her not being invited worth cutting you off like that ? The reaction seems pretty exaggerated.\n\nBut frankly, while I understand your mum being upset, her own rage-induced revenge was really unhelpful. She just threw fire to the flames and started a civil war, which isn't likely to stop soon because you sound like a stubborn bunch.\n\nBut OP, are hurt feelings worth cutting ties with people who clearly matter to you ? Over a wedding invitation to a plus one, no less ? I mean, that's a question only you can answer.\n\nBut if you *do* care about them enough, take up your phone. Call your aunt first, maybe. Tell her all of this is stupid - are we really going to stop talking after decades of love and friendship, all for a petty misunderstanding ? Avoid saying anything bad about the girlfriend, they'll be on the lookout for clues they're right about this. But repeat to her you simply *can't* afford the plus one, it wasn't meant to disrespect her link to the family.\n\nAlso, I think that if you only talk to the 15-year old girl to explain to her she's still welcome to your wedding, you can say goodbye about your other cousins and maybe your aunt.\n\nUp to you to see if it's worth the gamble.", "NTA. Your cousins are though.\n\nAnd your mother is fricken awesome for handling it like a boss sfter they'd upset you so badly.\n\nThe only way this can be resolved is if the cousins send a heartfelt apology.

Make sure you have a workable plan.  Ask your mom to reach out to 15 yo cousin and reiterate that she is still a bridesmaid and have your mom reach out to her sister/sister in law and make sure that the 15 yo isnt collateral damage.

OP was handling the situation fine; getting so bent out of shape over the cousins\u2019 refusal talk to her in person wasn\u2019t the smartest move, but interacting with them individually and (presumably) ultimately accepting their attendance decisions was the right move here. And the bridesmaid cousin, AKA the one she cared about most, was coming, which was the important part. Mom, however, is absolutely an AH. She had zero right to unilaterally uninvite anyone from OP\u2019s wedding, and if she\u2019s not going to walk back her mistake and fix things with bridesmaid cousin on OP\u2019s behalf, OP needs to get on that immediately!

My dad made some mean comments about how some of those people shouldn't have come, because they didn't know mom that well. But they were there to support *me,* through one of the most difficult times of my life. \n\nI'm just trying to avoid myopia in thinking that a wedding is only about the couple, or a funeral is only about the deceased.

Following up once with cousin whose gf is not invited was fine. Initial follow up with older cousin brother was fine. BUT THEN YOU NEEDED TO **STOP**. Just stop. Just. stop.\n3. You kept scratching the scab till it bled. You let it overwhelm you and your shared all that emotion with your mom. Honestly, it will help you a lot in life if you learn to just pause, breathe, walk away for a bit so that you can handle things better.\n4. It's clear, though, that YOUR MOM didn't learn those skills either. It was absolutely NOT HER PLACE to take such drastic action regarding YOUR invitations and guests. If YOUR MOM had learned to pause and breathe, herself; she might have taken time to think through her *recommendations* to you and talked through things with you. YOU would have had a chance to think through how you wanted to handle things and probably would have come to a very different answer than what your mom's shoot from the hip reaction was.\n5. You need to look at your relationship with your mom. Do you tend to get really emotional, run to mommy and she goes into hyper-mama-bear mode to protect you? Or is that how she generally deals with things, and you've learned some of those habits from her? Given how those cousins reacted, it might be something that runs in your mom's family. Figure out how to break that cycle!\n6. As for your poor cousin who will probably miss the wedding through no fault of her own... It's reasonable to assume that trying to contact your aunt will not go well right now. I suggest that you:\n\n* Text your 15 yo cousin and say that you are sorry everything has become a mess. You absolutely want her in your wedding, but you realize that now is not the time to push for anything. You hope you can help smooth things out soon.\n* DO NOT reach out to any other cousins/the aunt just now. Talk with your mom about how you both need to stop this dynamic and figure out if there's a path toward cleaning up this mess. Take time to ponder; if your dad or fiance is a calmer, less reactive person, get their take on it. It may require your mom to apologize to her sister for her over-reaction, that wasn't even her place to do.\n* None of this requires you to invite that one cousin's gf and certainly not to apologize for having that position to begin with. Cousin and his siblings were wrong to expect you to cave into his demands. I don't even recommend doing that to offset the mess you and your mom created. That would only encourage your cousin to think he was in the right - when he was actually very wrong.\n* If, in the end, your 15 yo cousin just doesn't get to come to your wedding, you can still let her know that you miss her, still get her things you were giving the other bridesmaids and ask her if you and she can do something special.", "Just fyi, you're not an asshole for not wanting to invite people to a wedding you've never met.

Then for his siblings to decline to come in order to side with him when you have been close with them your entire life and your mom and aunt had a very close relationship is unbelievable to me.

We both got 50% of the guest list to fill.\n* 2.  Aside from best man and maid-of-honour, no friends.  A family-only wedding.\n* 3.

Suddenly she wanted me to hire her friends to do the flowers and the catering and this and that (none of which we were planning to have *at all* because it was outside of budget) so that she had an excuse for them to be present at the wedding.  She started pressuring me to include cousins on her side that *I had only met as a result of her sudden panicked introductions* not just as guests but as bridesmaids, because apparently me choosing to include multiple cousins I grew up with and am close to was unfair as the numbers weren't even?  Even though she was asking me to include people who were strangers to me?\n\nShe wasn't even paying anything towards it.\n\nPeople get **weird** about weddings.  It's not your fault.

While it would be a nice courtesy, OP is **not** being a bad hostess by not allowing her cousin a +1 regardless of her reasoning, and it was extremely bad form for her cousin and his family to kick up a fuss about it. \n\nOP **would** be a bad hostess if she were not to allow a VIP guest who wasn't likely to know anyone at the wedding to have a +1. An example would be if OP had a good friend from college who lives far away and was coming to town specifically for the wedding. This person would know OP and maybe OP's partner but probably no one else, and neither OP nor her partner is likely to have much time to spend with her. Not allowing her a +1 simply because OP and her partner would not know that person would be bad etiquette because good hosts want their guests to feel comfortable and have fun, and a single guest left entirely on her own most of the time is unlikely to do either.", "Eh ...

You did not have to chase after them.", "I havent. My husband and I so got engaged after 4 months of long distance dating. I agree 6 months is t very long but by the time of the wedding it will be a year, which I think is plenty long enough.", "Normally, I am perfectly happy to attend weddings by myself. If I was in a relationship and all of my siblings that were also in a relationship had their partners invited, but mine was not, I would be hurt. I would consider it rude to not invite only one half of a couple to a wedding, with the caveat that they were in a serious relationship before the invitations went out. Most wedding etiquette I have read says that you shouldn't invite only half of a couple. Does your cousin consider his relationship to be serious? If I am reading the timeline right, they will have been together for a year or so by the time of the wedding. For some people that is long enough they might be living together or considering engagement or marriage. \n\nYou are of course allowed to invite whoever you want, but it may have been easier, less stressful and worth the extra cost to have invited this one cousin's girlfriend rather than deal with all of this family drama. Just because you invite one cousin's girlfriend it doesn't mean you would have to give plus ones to other's who weren't given one.", "If this is the case then reinstate the invitations for those who were already coming. Tell your mom to stay in her lane and to not go behind your back again. You are getting married so you need the boundary of when you are venting to your mom and when you need her to do something. You didn't need her to do anything. \n\nYou did mess up when you repeatedly sent text messages asking people if they were attending. You got answers you didn't like so you involved your mom. No is no is no. Originally your cousin RSVPed no and you couldn't take the no. It doesn't matter why he said no. He said no.", "OP, we just found your cousin's burner account", "If I was the girlfriend I might not even want to go! Like I\u2019ve gone to weddings as a plus one where I didn\u2019t know a single person. And I had fun and got to know some of my friends\u2019 friends. But like meeting the extended family (and like the in laws of my cousin) of my significant other\u2019s of less than a year at a wedding seems like something that I wouldn\u2019t want. Like there\u2019s a time and place to meet the family and that just ain\u2019t it.", "Nta your wedding your rules honestly from the sounds of it F your family and have your day with your true loved ones cause these are just pathetic losers that would place a stranger ahead of their own blood", "It\u2019s not for the \u201cgirl\u201d, it\u2019s for your cousin."]}
