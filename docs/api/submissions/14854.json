It will be a lot of stress that I feel it's unnecessary.\n\n  \nThis sounds like it would make life and the pregnancy experience worse, not better.\n\n  \nMight end up being unpopular, but NTA. Uprooting your life and moving 8 hours away to a place where you might not have an income or a place to live is stressful enough without expecting a child. She's have have to find a new OB and establish a new birth plan. It might all end up being more stressful than she realizes.\n\nWhat is her mother's situation? Can she temporarily move to your city to help with her daughter?", "So, she moved to your hometown for college, married local with roots there, starts a career there, and even buys a house. \n\nNow you are both supposed to abandon your jobs so she can be near her family? Are they really that awesome? Better than having jobs and health insurance? \n\nNTA", "NTA.  She is experiencing severe anxiety over this.  You need to reassure her that YOU are her family.  She should feel safest with you.  She probably needs to talk to a professional counselor about this.  This is a HUGE deviation from what both of you planned, it seems.  Perhaps this is always what she wanted and figured she would get her way when you had kids?  That might be a drastic assumption but still has to be considered.  Regardless, I don't think it is fair to you to all of a sudden expect you to drop the life you two have built and move.", "NTA.  This doesn't feel like a collaborative decision.  It seems rash and not well thought out.  If she has been feeling this way for awhile, she should have been talking about it prior to now.  It seems you all discussed where you will call home prior to marriage.  I hate to blame it on this, but her hormones and anxiety may be at play here.    It may help to sort through some of her feelings, understand where she needs suppott, maybe even recommend couples therapy to prepare for this transition to parenthood.", "Assuming there was no prior agreement that you would do that if she got pregnantand that your marriage has not been a constant situation of her compromising for what you want, NTA.\n\n  \nThe middle of a pregnancy is not the time to uproot your lives completely and take away all of your financial stability.  And as a general rule, it's a few years before you can sell a house and not take a loss.\n\nThat doesn't mean you don't need to honestly discuss the long range plan, you can't just assume  that it's ok to stay in your hometown forever, even if you bought a house, but it needs to be a careful, thoroughly assessed decision, not an impulsive, emotional response.\n\nAnd if she fears that she won't have enough support, or wants her OWN support, you need to make every effort to support that.     Your family is not a substitute for her own.    Look at whether she can visit her family for a while or whether you can have some of her family come out to you for a bit.  If you're not willing to make the effort to support her and offer her additional support, and you are not open to considering changes in the long term, then you would be TA.", "NTA.  There are lots of logistical and financial considerations in doing a move like this. Do you have enough equity in the house so that when you sell it you\u2019ll still have money left over to finance the move and finance buying a new house?  What are the Job opportunities in the new town? will you be able to sell your current house easily? Can you afford to have your current house on the market while paying to live somewhere else?  This is a very short list of things to be considered.", "NTA you are prioritizing your paycheck, health insurance & livelihood. If she wanted to be close to them, this should have been discussed & planned way before she got pregnant. I\u2019d recommend therapy and working on a plan to move forward together.", "Info: If you move, how is your health insurance going to be impacted? The cost of baby catching is exorbitant. \n\nPerhaps offer up a rotation of in-laws on her side to spend some time with you to help with care.", "INFO: Are you in the US? Can you let us know what states are involved?\n\nThere\u2019s some really scary stuff going on with maternity care right now, and I\u2019m wondering if that may be a factor that you\u2019re overlooking. Do you live somewhere that is increasing restrictions on abortion and in the process preventing doctors from intervening to protect pregnant people facing complications?", "NTA; especially since you bought the house and have jobs. How does she expect to find work etc. However, don't tell her that your family is there. Sorry, but that is way different than her own family. Maybe you could talk to her and her mum (maybe her sister too) if they have time etc. to visit for a longer period when the baby comes to support her?", "INFO: What are the current laws around reproductive health in your state versus where her family is? Is that a factor in her wanting to move?\n\nI hate to say it, but it\u2019s a real factor these days that if you have a pregnancy-related medical emergency in a state with strict abortion bans, it could be fatal. She would not be TA if she wants safer access to medical care during her pregnancy.", "NTA-moving, house hunting and finding new jobs all sounds super stressful. I don't think she is thinking clearly here. Maybe her family members could come visit more instead.", "Question, is your family truly welcoming to her? Has she ever said anything to you about your mom and sisters treating her poorly or now being too invasive?\n\nI just wonder if perhaps your family supports you, but not her and are treating her like an incubator or aren't as great as you say.", "NAH. Uprooting is tough. Be prepared for her to go w/o you tho.", "I'm going to say NAH.  You guys just bought a house, you have jobs, you guys had a plan.  That a lot of variables in addition to a pregnancy, lots of questions about cost of living, what jobs are out there, what's the job market and pay/benefits out there. \n\nI get wanting to have her mom with her in a difficult pregnancy but this isn't a decision you make, uprooting your guys entire life and plan on the drop of a hat.  \n\nYou need to sit down together and have a honest discussion and thoroughly chase down the specifics and see if it's feasible and works for the both of you or find another solution like having her mom move in temporarily with you guys for the duration of the pregnant + time after the birth.", "NTA. Financially you would seriously disadvantaging yourselves, not even factoring health insurance etc. if her family all works there is unlikely to be any childcare benefit to moving. Costs associated with selling and moving would be expensive. Unless there are fantastic job opportunities that would double or triple your take home, it feels like a very bad idea.", "She\u2019s being emotional, you\u2019re being rational/logical.  Having been married for 21 years, I can tell you there are no winners in this argument.  You have really good reasons NOT to move with a new baby on the way.  She\u2019s starting the nesting phase and you can\u2019t counter that.\n\nStability is the number one thing.  If you try to do all the things now right before the birth, it\u2019ll all be on you because the stress for her will result in her hiding out at her mom\u2019s or sisters while you get the move completed and new house setup.\n\nI would offer a compromise to her.  If you have the funds, can her mom come for a long visit?  I would also suggest that you offer to sit down with her 6 months after the baby is born, and look at job opportunities near her hometown and possibly housing options.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she might suggest to be a stay at home mom.  Bottom line: after birth she\u2019ll be more rational.  \n\nMost importantly, you currently know exactly what medical benefits you have right now for the birth versus a new job (if you can\u2019t find one in time) might have better, similar, or worse benefits. Also, changing doctors and birth hospital will also introduce more stress for her.\n\nShe might not be willing to hear your concerns orally, so you might want to respond in writing out your thoughts an options.  Be supportive of her desires and point out the pros and cons of a potential move before birth and options 6 months after.  Include an offer to host her family members for 2-3 months to.  If you do all this, I think she\u2019ll be able to consider it rationally.  BUT, don\u2019t say anything you don\u2019t mean.  If she really wants to move, and you offer, don\u2019t hold it against her later down the line.", "NTA. She does not get to unilaterally decide to uproot your lives and move. It doesn't sound like she wants this to be temporary either (to support the pregnancy). \n\nPerhaps schedule a visit with her family, but it sounds to me like she probably just wants her family involved in the baby's life and is not considering that it's not just her child. It's also yours and your family is nearby.\n\nMight be good to hash this out with a counselor present.", "this is a very grey area but i understand you more. obviously, everyone wants to be closer to their families but you\u2019ve already built your lives there and moving and abandoning everything you have - not a great idea. but again, it\u2019s kinda complicated", "She wants to permanently move for a temporary situation? NTA. You guy have already settled roots here and connections. So you move, do you even have the finances to support selling and buying another house? Does her family even know about this? And are they prepared to house you both and a baby in the even that you can\u2019t get a job as soon as you move. \n\nLogistically this just doesn\u2019t sound smart. I think she\u2019s just nervous about a first time pregnancy and just wants family around. Maybe a compromise would be asking if her mother could stay with you temporary until at little after the baby is born.", "The nesting instinct is strong, and pregnancy hormones make women fixate on strange things and all of her big feelings are overwhelming her. She sounds very anxious. You need to have a heart to heart talk with her, and to find out more about why she's feeling this way, and figure out how to make her feel better.\n\n If out of the blue she wants to make all these big changes, she's freaking out about something. Do not be angry with her because of her feelings, it will only increase her desire to move because she's feeling unheard/unsupported. Let her know that a move isn't something that can happen right now, but that you want to try to find a way you'll both be happy. \n\nI'm going to say NAH because I just had a baby, and the hormones, fear/anxiety, and my instincts kicked my ass, and it sounds like that's what's happening here.", "This pregnant privilege is out of control. You have a home, jobs, a support network since college.  Not the time to move and uproot your lives.  \n\nYou are NTA.", "Perhaps, she could go back to her mother's house until she recovers from child birth. Most people do this. Then they will come home. You do not need to uproot. Just take leave from work if you want to be there for her. \n\nAlso, she could benefit the support from her family. Perhaps you can at least try to make your calculations for this temporary stay. At least, she knows you have tried to consider the option.", "Info: what is her health like? \n\nMy daughter insisted on moving back in with us during her only successful pregnancy. She had severe problems (vomiting several times a day, couldn't keep any food down, eventually wound up hospitalized) and was on a home hydration IV. Her then-husband thought she ought to be just fine while he was at work.", "NAH. Pregnancy is tough. Having the support of your own family is different than inlaws.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to acknowledge that your mother and sisters are not the same support for her as her own family is.\n\nThat's a different relationship, and maybe it's super close and they are besties. But maybe they aren't. And even if they are, pregnancy is an incredibly intimate time and she may find that even a close relationship with your family isn't sufficient to meet her needs.\n\nMoving 8 hours away at 15 weeks pregnant would be a nightmare scenario for me, and it's not a reasonable ask, but your family may not be the support you think it is either.", "NTA, if her pregnancy has been hard so far, does she really think quitting jobs, selling a house and uprooting your entire life while heavily pregnant is going to go well?  She\u2019s delusional.", "NTA.. BTW good luck in the future", "NTA this is the single worst idea I have read lately. You are established in your current city, it would be beyond stupid to uproot your entire life to move to a different city and start again. You would be buying a house with high interest. Then be expected to find comparable income when most companies are not hiring due to a future recession, I hope you don't work in tech the hiring freeze is huge and layoffs are happening everywhere.", "Info: what do you mean by her pregnancy has been hard and she needs the support?", "INFO: have you considered your wife is feeling extremely anxious about the pregnancy and possible risks associated with it and might want the comfort of a familiar place?", "NAH. She\u2019s probably frightened & overwhelmed & just wants the relative safety & comfort of her own family around her (not discounting you as family)! Even if your family are amazing she\u2019s bound to miss her own people and I think for other peoples families it\u2019s harder to be completely relaxed in a vulnerable situation. But a move 8 hours away isn\u2019t practical for you both right now & perhaps assure her that the topic can be visited again when your baby is around 18 months if she\u2019s still determined to move back then, to give you both time to look at the practicalities of such a big move. Can you arrange with your in-laws for them to come to you to help out towards the end of the pregnancy & again when you go back to work after the baby is born?", "ESH. You need to understand that having your mother in law there is NOT the same as having your own mom there. Not even close. And the truth is yes, you are prioritizing your own comfort. You don\u2019t want to move because it would be uncomfortable for *you*. \n\nThat said, moving to another city is a big deal and she\u2019s being unreasonable to expect you can just suddenly pack up and leave, especially when it involves getting new jobs and selling/buying a house etc. Where to live is a decision that needs to be made together and one you both need to be on board with. \n\nWhat is your plan for childcare after the baby is born? How will you be splitting the parenting responsibilities and household chores? She may be realizing now that she\u2019s going to need a lot more help.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds as if it would be easier for her mum to move in with you guys until the baby is born.  Sounds like either your wife is being quite selfish or she is being manipulated by her family.\n\nWhere does she propose you live after the baby is born?  Its your child too so should have equal say in the matter.\n\nMoving house and getting a new job is time consuming and stresfull and its likely she is going to be quite late in her pregnancy when its all sorted which won't be easy.", "NTA. She is indeed unreasonable, probably because hormones. You cannot accept her request because that would bring much more stress to your life and to your wife life too.", "NTA", "Among the life stress factors, changing jobs and moving both are top stress inducers.  So, along with new baby - also stress - she just wants to tick every box for creating personal burden and tension.  Not to mention financial burden and uncertainty.\n\nShe's pregnant and focused on that, understandable.  But uprooting in the middle of it is an idea so bad it's difficult to fully articulate.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Personally I would rethink my relationship if she wants to choose her family over her husband like this.  If you pack up and move now you have to find another place and you'll probably have to do most of the moving because she won't necessarily be able to do very much.  That's unfair to put that burden on you.", "ESH. Your wife is essentially telling you that your family is not enough support for her during this time; you need to listen. She\u2019s the one growing a person. \n\nYour wife sucks, too. Uprooting your entire life is huge, and she should have told you this was what she wanted before you ever even considered starting a family; she can\u2019t just make this unilateral decision now and expect you to happily go along with it. If she thinks pregnancy is stressful, being unemployed and moving is much worse. \n\nNot sure where there\u2019s a middle ground in this, but you need to communicate with each other to get to find one. Maybe her family comes and stays for an extended period of time to support her where you currently live?", "ESH\n\nThis should be a conversation and joint decision that you both take time and think over. It was also something you should have probably discussed prior to her getting pregnant.\n\nShe's being an asshole just expecting you to agree with her. You're the asshole because you don't seem to understand she isn't getting something she needs in regards to support. Your family is *not* the same as hers.", "She chose to move away from her family, if she wants to move back in with them you\u2019re not obligated to follow her. If she needs them so badly for the time being, one of them could come to you.", "No one is an asshole here. But I completely understand her point of view as I have been in a similar situation myself. I guess the hormones etc involved in the pregnancy are likely making her mentally unstable. When I feel mentally weak the first thing I think about is that I want to be with my family. They are so deeply connected with me that even being around them gives me comfort. So I understand both of you. But I thought I'd give you a perspective that aligns with her's. Best of luck \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, but unfortunately for OP, I expect a follow up where he admits he caved in to keep his wife happy, they uproot their entire lives and are then stuck in her family's town, with crappy jobs and unhappy. She will then ask to move again, give it 2/3 years. And OP will have to do it all over again. And if says even once \"I told this would happen\", she will be mad again and he will come here asking if he is the AH\nThe circle of life", "ESH\n\nThis should have been discussed prior to the baby. Both of your opinions are valid here, you have built a life and don't want to move away. She doesn't want to raise a child without the support of her family (no your family is not the alternative you think it is)\n\nPlus you are both being dismissive of eachothers thoughts making everything worse.\n\nYou have both done a stellar job communicating here well done!", "ESH. I do have a question though that maybe I missed getting answered. Has yours and/or her family expressed interest in assisting to the point where they would be considered \"support\"? Making assumptions, on either side, could be devastating for your situation, regardless of what choice you all make. No one's job is to take care of your baby but you two and any doctors while the baby is under their care. \n\nIt sounds like you all may not have planned this out.  Your wife is reacting to a situation where she doesn't feel there is thorough planning and is starting to realize you two will be responsible for a life. No sacrifice with greater rewards is too great, but sacrifices that put your wife, your baby and you in jeopardy, are dangerous. \n\nSounds like tea time for you two. Good luck.", "ESH This is something that needed to be discussed BEFORE she got pregnant.

Why you have to follow. NTA", "YTA.  You're not the asshole for not wanting to move, you're the asshole for letting things get this bad for her. She wants to move so she has support.
