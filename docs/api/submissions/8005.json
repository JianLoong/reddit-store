You didn't want to worry them....so, an ambulance blaring up to their door unexpectedly \n*wouldn't * worry them???\n\nWhat is wrong with you??", "Former 911 dispatcher here. \n\nFirst of all, your medical emergency is your own business, and you should not have to consult with someone before calling. You are not the AH for that. But in not letting your parents know you were calling, you did two things: scared the shit out of them by not giving them a head\u2019s up, and potentially put your own life in danger. That makes YTA. \n\nWe don\u2019t know what the nature of your medical emergency was, and don\u2019t need to. But if it was severe enough that you needed an ambulance, you need to be aware that it\u2019s severe enough that you might lose consciousness before they get there. \n\nOne night, I dispatched EMS for a man with a possible heart attack. He never told other people in the house that something was wrong. He was having trouble speaking, and the house number was not visible, so we weren\u2019t sure if the ambulance had gone to the right house. It was all dark, no lights on. \n\nI called him back and he had just enough strength left to answer the phone, but couldn\u2019t get to the door or turn on a light. He could no longer speak to let me know we had the right house or get someone to help.\n\nI had the ambulance drive up and down the street with all lights and sirens blaring at 4 AM, until I could hear it in the background on the phone. After what seemed like an eternity, I heard someone come into the room complaining about the noise outside. I was screaming into the phone, trying to get their attention to have them open the door for the ambulance. \n\nThankfully, the other person picked up the phone and immediately went to the door to let EMS in. The man who originally called had gone into cardiac arrest. I\u2019m not sure if they were able to resuscitate him. \n\nSo while you may be not entirely the AH it\u2019s a pretty stupid idea to not at least let someone else in the house know they need to open the door for EMS.\n\nEdit: I saw the rest of your responses.

As an adult, you don\u2019t owe anyone, including your parents, an explanation, but anyone in the house should be given a heads up-whether it be parents or simply roommates. They aren\u2019t owed details, but a factual \u201cIm having an emergency, ambulance on its way, don\u2019t ask questions\u201d was warranted. Would they have asked?

If you didn't want your parents to drive you then you should have called for a taxi.\n\n2) Not telling the homeowners about emergency services appearing is stupid. If you parent's say no one called and that it was a prank, ES might see it as a potential kidnapping and someone inside called for help which would lead to arrests. The homeowners might shoot the ES since they have no idea they were coming or the ES might shoot the homeowners if they had a knife.\n\n3) Not informing them can lead to problems when it does prove to be an emergency and they don't know what's wrong. Reading comments it seems like you OD'd on some drugs in which case tell your fucking parents you OD'd on X drugs and you think you might have a seizure so they can tell EMS which drug it was to get you help ASAP. If you don't say which drug specifically they'll need to figure out the drug which can cause you to fucking die from heart failure or something while they frantically search for whatever the fuck it was you took.", "YTA.

You weren\u2019t trying to avoid embarrassment, you hid something potentially very dangerous.", "You don\u2019t \u201cthink\u201d you\u2019re having a seizure so it\u2019s hypochondriac ppl", "\u2026and fell on something?", "Wow, YTA my husband had a seizure and it was the scariest thing I have lived through (he doesn't really remember it, just being in the hospital later). If he had the presence of mind to call 911 because he thought he was having a seizure and didn't tell me, that would cause me to rethink our marriage.\n\nThese were your parents in their home, you have no defense.", "I mean were you having a seizure\u2026?", "So why didn't you go to your parents and say \"Mom, Dad, I think I'm having a seizure?\" If your parents were actually able to drive you to the hospital, if you'd actually informed them, then you're automatically YTA for calling an ambulance when you had another way of getting to the hospital.\n\nBecause that ambulance could have been used for someone that was actually dying.", "If you were having a seizure, it would have been good to have someone with you until the ambulance arrived, to help keep you from injury. YTA", "I've had seizures,  I only know because I either wake up in hospital and/or someone has told me I've had one.. I don't think if OP was having a seizures, she would be able to call 911. I have found that some people think they're having seizures, but then go to describe orthostatic hypotension. (And in one case, that they liked the feeling).", "\"I fell awkwardly\"", "Do you know if OP is male?", "When I had seizures, I typically got a couple of minutes warning that I knew I was going to have a grand mal. I called it a \u201chead funk\u201d because I knew what was going on around me but my brain couldn\u2019t process it, when I got that feeling if there was someone around, I always made sure to inform them the best I could, because sometimes I\u2019d try to tell them but the words that came out wasn\u2019t quite right or the sentences were jumbled up. I\u2019ve only gone to the hospital like 3 times for seizures (the first one and the other two were injuries from the seizures), I had a seizure in public once with my friends, and a stranger walked past, and my friends told her they don\u2019t need to call 999 because they can handle it, the stranger still called them, ambulance arrived and the paramedics also told the stranger that she didn\u2019t need to call 999 either. When I came round from a seizure, everything was fuzzy for bit, then I\u2019d just go sleep in my bed for a day. Everyone experiences seizures differently.", "or the better excuse, and one my friend has legit heard, \"I don't know how it got there\"", "The macaroni man on Seinfeld?", "Omg...this!", "Oh shoot. Thanks for pointing that out. Thought I read 27m.", "I had a warning before my grand mal - I didn\u2019t KNOW it was a warning at the time, as it was my first (and only, knock on wood) seizure. Felt like my brain was a skipping CD, kept thinking the same inane thought over and over, with a rising sense of panic that something was very very wrong. I was pulling out my my mobile to call my husband and tell him I needed help when I went down. (Unfortunately smashed my head in which made the recovery harder, but very grateful for the members of the public who came to my aid!)", "It was a million to one shot!", "Hey, you could still be right!  The whole situation is weird!"]}
