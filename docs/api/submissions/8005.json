You're talking about an **actual emergency** that happened. **Was** there a problem with the car? **Could** you guys have gotten there on your own?\n\nBecause like I started with: what aren't you telling us? What is going on with your relationship with your parents in the first place?", "YTA. Not for calling 911 if you felt you really needed it. Going to the hospital can end up with hours of waiting in pain. \n\n>I suppose that it scared them more to see the ambulance arriving at our driveway.\n\nThis is why you are an ass. You should have told them you called 911, and an ambulance was on the way.", "Kind of YTA. I'd freak out if there was suddenly an ambulance and cops at my door. And, if I didn't know any better, I'd probably tell them they have the wrong house.", "Can you imagine just chilling out at home and having an ambulance show up asking where the medical emergency is and trying to have to argue with a paramedic that nobody called?\n\nYTA. They shouldn't be making your health decisions for you but you shouldn't be doing what appears to be a completely weird power move by having emergency services show up at your place.", "YTA\n\nYou don't need their approval to call an ambulance or go to the hospital. At all.\n\nBut you live in the same house with them and they were home so you should have informed them that you called an ambulance (edit: unless you were unable to due to the nature of the emergency but that doesn't sound like the case here). This would be true even if they were any other roommates rather than your parents.", "YTA.  And not just because what you did was disrespectful and scary to your parents.\n\nAs a first responder, I would have chewed you out.  This could have gone very badly for your parents or the first responders or for you.\n\n1. If the first responders didn't know your parents were in the house and just barged in, your parents might have thought it a home invasion and someone could have died.  I lost two friends who were paramedics that way.  I also knew a homeowner that was in the kitchen when police and ems walked in.  They stepped out holding a knife and was shot by a cop.\n2. What if your parents thought it was a prank call and told the cops there was no medical emergency?  Depending on the severity of the situation at best you would have delayed treatment, at worst if you had something very serious you might have died.\n3. Depending on the situation, your parents might have been able to do things to help stabilize you until the ems arrived.\n\nSo yeah, as a first responder, I'm pissed you would think this sort of game was okay.", "YTA.  If you're calling 911 then you should be telling people in the same house.  What the hell.\n\nIt's not about \"consulting\" anyone.", "INFO: what happened to you that made you call 911? Do you think your parents would have dismissed your symptoms if you\u2019ve asked them to call an ambulance? Is that why you didn\u2019t let them know? I can\u2019t give a verdict without this information. Because on one hand yeah, you\u2019re a grown ass adult. On the other, you\u2019re 27 and still live with your parents.", "YTA - I find it out you were in such dire health crisis you called 911 but did not tell the people in the house with you. You definitely should get the medical help you need but maybe tell them that ambulances are coming - that can be super scary if unexpected", "INFO: what did you have up your butt?", "YTA. What if your medical emergency made you not be able to respond to paramedics when they arrived? Your parents wouldn\u2019t know what was going on or how to advocate for you. Even when I had an emergency at home, I told me neighbors what was going on so that they wouldn\u2019t worry when fire trucks arrived. If your parents are so awful and you\u2019re a \u201c27 year old grown adult\u201d and you want to live completely independently from them, then why are you still living there? Move out. When I was 27 I had my own apartment.  Just the way you said that makes YTA.", "That\u2019s a super complex question. I think it\u2019s fine you called an ambulance if you felt it was necessary but yes, you absolutely should have alerted everyone else in your home that an ambulance was coming *if you were physically capable of doing so*. This is true regardless if this was your parents house or an apartment with roommates.  Even if you were at a hotel, I\u2019d still say call the front desk and tell them an ambulance is about to arrive for you. \n\nSo yeah, YTA for not telling them but NTA for calling the ambulance in the first place.", "YTA - unless you were incapacitated to the point where you couldn't tell them. But you should have told them an ambulance was on its way and ideally shared your symptoms so they could communicate with EMTs if you were unable to.", "YTA\n\nThey needed to be aware that an ambulance was coming to their house so that when they answered the door, they didn\u2019t turn them away. Also, if your health is so dire that an ambulance is necessary, notifying someone else that you are that sick is always a good idea in case you get worse. If the paramedics arrive and you are passed out, it is important to know how long you have been unconscious for and what you were feeling before you lost consciousness. \n\nAmbulances are not just free rides to the hospital. If there is someone available to drive you to the ER, you should be using that instead of tying up a resource that is supposed to be for emergencies. Also, an ambulance ride doesn\u2019t get you to the front of the line at the ER\u2014they still triage you like if you walked in yourself. \n\nIf you want to be treated as an adult, you need to act like one.", "Always use a toy with a sufficient glared based that is intended for anal play. You don\u2019t just wait until paramedics are knocking on the door to tell other residents in the home that they\u2019re coming. Of course YTA. You needed to give them a heads up and tell them the age old lie told in ERs round the world. You slipped in the shower and now need emergent medical care.", "YTA. You couldn't literally just shout downstairs \"Hey, I feel really unwell. I've called an ambulance\"?\n\n It's not that an ambulance appearing will have freaked them out, it's that you were somewhere in the house, sick enough to call an ambulance, and you didn't even let them know. They would have looked after you until the ambulance got there. They're probably upset that you didn't trust them enough to inform them you were seriously ill\n\nInfo: do you have some sort of issue with your family? Because the only way your NTA is if they've refused to acknowledge medical issues previously or if you know they'd have kicked off about the cost (though you said that was covered)", "I don't think they're controling your health I just think they were worried, I mean, any decent parent would want to know if their son is feeling sick or needs to go to the hospital at any age one does not stop worrying about their son just bc they get to certain age, also receiving an ambulance in your house without further notice it's kind of scary", "you dont have to ask permission or consult but you should deff have told them u feel sick and an ambulance its on its way since u live in the same house. you are a bit of  A for that alone...", "INFO. What could have been your parents reaction if you requested help instead", "I can see why they'd be freaked out having an Ambulance they know nothing about appearing at the house. A very soft YTA.", "YTA. They could\u2019ve had a heart attack themselves. 27 years old and doesnt know any common courtesy", "Yeah \u201cnot wanting to make them worry\u201d by calling an ambulance makes no sense. If your medical condition doesn\u2019t impair your judgement, low key  YTA", "if you want your life to be separate from your parents, you need to move out. YTA, people deserve to know when someone living in the same house as them has been hospitalized, tenfold if its their own child.", "Did you have a true medical emergency or just need non emergent transport to the hospital? I would think a true emergency would have you alerting everyone around you.  This makes no sense. YTA.  If you don't want to involve the people you live with to a real emergency, you need to live by yourself.", "YTA for not telling them (no one is ever the a h for calling an ambulance if they need one). Seeing an ambulance pull up to the house without having been made aware is needlessly jarring and scary.", "It's your right to call the abulance, but you should also inform the people living in the same housr that an ambulance is coming. What did you expect? That your parents will see the abulance but won't ask you about it or worry? YTA", "YTA I don't know why you think an ambulance could show up at their house without them being concerned about what was going on. If you want to be a full adult who doesn't tell your parents anything, then move out.", "\"Why should I consult them to control my own health?\"\n\nThis was a weird statement, which leads me to believe a big chunk of a backstory is missing here, like they've controlled your health in the past, and you wanted to prove to them that you're a big girl in control of your own health. Sure, you can call the ambulance, but common courtesy dictates that you alert others in the household, whether they are your parents or roommates or whomever, that an ambulance is on its way. YTA.", "Nah - it was probably scary for your parents, and a heads up would have been a good thing. But you were concerned for your well-being and focused on that, rightfully. I hope you're doing alright now.", "NTA in a medical emergency, ambulance workers begin treatment before you even arrive at the emergency room. I don't understand why your parents are this controlling over another adult. I'm guessing you didn't tell them because they would have told you not to call or some other interference.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
