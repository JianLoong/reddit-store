We have a one year old daughter together. We live on the same property as her parents,  but in a different house.\n\nLani has 4 younger siblings who live in the other house ages 13, 12, 10, and 7. Moving into the property we did agree to sometimes watch the kids. We had also discussed with MIL her being home more when the baby is born, which she agreed. MIL works at a casino, and since we\u2019ve been staying there she\u2019s turned that into her job, and hobby. Working, then getting drunk and high hanging out after work. This included her being gone 5-6 days out of the week, sometimes till 4 or 5 am, hours after her promising time of being home. Since we\u2019ve had our daughter this has became harder and harder to Maintain all the children while working and taking care of our child. I brought this up to her the other day how we felt she was taking advantage and how she really needed to be home more since we have a baby of our own. She got angry and said we agreed to help watch the kids and how nice she is for letting us rent out her other trailer. I then said,  we had agreed to watch them sometimes, but it isn\u2019t our job to watch YOUR kids.\n\nThis really pissed her off, and caused a huge argument. She went on this huge rant how bills need to be paid, and how a 13 year old can\u2019t be left alone with 3 younger kids. She\u2019s also threatening to raise our rent. I really don\u2019t think it is a unreasonable request to ask her to watch her own kids.", "created_utc": 1678982609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11sy7fn/aita_for_telling_mil_it_isnt_our_job_to_watch_her/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If not, set a strict schedule of when you will watch the kids and stick to it.  Is the dad in the picture?", "NTA. You need to start looking for other living arrangements. The likelihood of this changing is practically zero, in truth, it\u2019s likely to get worse.", "NTA but she's going to hold this over on you as long as you live on her property even if you are paying rent.    She's not holding up to the agreement but she likely had a different idea of what that agreement would really look like vs. you.  I'm guessing your wife was chief babysitter prior to your marriage too and she's being expected to continue.\n\nThe way you get out of this is to move elsewhere and not be dependent on your MIL, preferably a good enough distance away that she can't try and dump the kids off on you either.  Though you are going to need to look out for the kids, I'm sure the MIL will take advantage of the older ones shortly as well.", "NTA but I'm going to be blunt on saying that you need to figure out a way to move out asap.\n\nYou have little businesses agreeing to babysit at all when you have a baby of your own.\n\nHeck I'm going to say that you shouldn't even have agreed to this living arrangement to begin with", "NTA but start looking elsewhere for housing as this isn't going to end well. Also why do the 13 yr old and 12 yr old need a babysitter? I get 10 & 7, but the other two are old enough and smart enough to know who to call in an emergency and how to follow rules.", "NTA\u2014 sometimes isn\u2019t every time. but I\u2019d be finding somewhere else to live so you aren\u2019t in the area to be available to babysit.", "NTA she sounds terrible and neglectful but you guys clearly need to get the hell off her property because it\u2019s only going to get worse. You guys have made the mistake of giving her control over you, in a pretty significant way. Don\u2019t let her have that, definitely get out. When you get married you should always have plans to be self sustainable, for this exact reason", "NTA for not wanting to be built in unpaid sitters.\n\nHowever, since she is your landlord she has all of the power to raise your rent or kick you two out. \n\nWere I in your shoes, I would try to find another place to live, as MIL is going to continue to dump her kids on you as long as you are \"indebted to her\" for letting you two rent out her extra trailer. Until then, I would absolutely expect this to continue happening.", "NTA but MIL sure is. \n\nYou didn't move there to be a built-in full-time babysitting service and ensure she doesn't need to be a parent. Sitting once in a while is fine. Everyday? Until whatever hours of the morning? No thanks. They're not YOUR kids.\n\nYou may want to start looking for a different place to live.", "NTA: Seriously look to live elsewhere ASAP.", "NTA.  It isn\u2019t \u201chelping\u201d when you\u2019re actually doing all the work.", "NTA, if you are already paying a rent she can't expect you to work also as a babysitter. You can ask to deduct a reasonable amount from your rent for the per hour babysitting, but i doubt this threat back will really work. Might be time to look for your own place?", "Nta. \n\n\nU need to get out now", "NTA but find somewhere else to live", "Generally NTA here, however, due to lack of boundaries and expectations, the group also earns a solid ESH.  This can all be fixed with solid communication and if needed actual contracts to address needs, rent, and coverage.  \n\nI suspect the MIL was hoping to gain some freedom with having you there and didn't fully communicate her needs, wants and desires beyond watching her kids every so often.  Definition will help.  \n\nMoving out may be a solid option, however, I also suspect that you have a fairly inexpensive setup and being there will allow you to save for a home sooner than later.  It might be worth the headache in the long run to stick it out until you reach your savings goal.", "Nta but it's a rock and a hard place as long as you're there. I feel bad as well for the siblings,  I'd be saying yta if she really was just strictly working so much to keep things afloat. But her hanging out EVERY night and spending money on drinks etc is too much with 4 kids 13 and under. I hope you guys can move out and I hope she's home for her kids more when you do.", "NTA. You agreed to help, not to become their parents.", "NTA, but its time to move.", "NTA. Even if you exaggerated any bit of this post it doesn't excuse her actions (or lack of them). She needs to be a mother not only to the kids you help her take care of but to your wife as well. 22 is NOTHING in life. You guys have so much to look forward to and deserve to live with your child without the burden of constantly taking care of other kids. You might love them and even your MIL but they are not your responsibility. You are renting and not living there for free but even if you were she can't dump her kids on you when she feels like it because of that. She needs to grow up and be a parent or cut your rent or something that would make being there worth it.", "Don't forget to alert CPS after you move out if she tries to dump this all on the 13-year-old's shoulders. I would keep good communication with her(the 13-year-old). You can be a good support without being a babysitter.", "ESH. You and your wife for agreeing to \"sometimes\" care for 4 children while having a baby yourselves, and not clearly defining how much childcare you were willing to take on. You're young though, and you may not have learned the important lesson that opportunistic people will run right over you and your boundaries if given the chance. This is especially true in your case since your MIL controls your housing situation and can use it against you. Your MIL is an AH for dumping her 4 kids on you all of the time and for holding your living situation over your heads if you do not do what she wants. You were unwise to give your MIL this power over you in the first place, but you can learn from this. Move out and take your lives back!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You said yourself that she has started getting drunk and high and staying out longer since you moved on to her property. It sounds like it has gone from casual drinking/getting high to more of an addiction, so you will probably need to move if you don't want to watch the your wifes siblings as often as you do.
