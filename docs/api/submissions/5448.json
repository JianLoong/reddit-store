When Adam and I were dating, I found out I was pregnant with my ex\u2019s kid. Adam didn\u2019t care and was thrilled because he\u2019s infertile, and has always wanted to be a dad. I tried for over a year to get in contact with my ex to see if he wanted to be a dad, and he nor his family ever answered me. Even when I went to their houses. So A has been my daughter\u2019s (3F who we\u2019ll call Calli) dad her whole life, and legally adopted her at 2. Sorry for the tangent, but it\u2019s relevant.\n\nWe\u2019re in freezing cold weather, and have lost power during higher temps than this the last two years. A kid in our neighborhood got really sick last year because he nearly froze. So I set up my and my husband\u2019s bed to be a kind of tent so it would keep all the body heat in. It\u2019s a California King, so there\u2019s PLENTY of room for us, Calli and our dog who sleeps with us anyway.\n\nI got Callie ready for bed, and tucked her in in our bed to finish getting ready. Adam asked why she was in our bed, and I explained I was afraid of the power going out because we\u2019ve already gotten warnings and the past two years. He was angry and said that he shouldn\u2019t have to share his bed with her because he might want \u201cloving\u201d. I told him that I wasn\u2019t going to be in the mood tonight because it\u2019s 6 degrees and I\u2019d be worried about Calli.\n\nLong story short, after a huge fight, I took the whole set up (so only leaving him the sheets, duvet and one blanket) and did it over my daughter\u2019s bed. I slept in there with her, and our dog followed us. Adam was so angry this morning that he accused me of wanting a divorce. I just told him that Calli was coming to work with me today, and I\u2019m dropping the dog off at my mother\u2019s since she works from home so he\u2019s not alone in case the power goes off. Adam went off to work and I\u2019m getting texts from my in laws and a couple mutual friends. Someone even texted me that expecting him to share a bed with a girl he\u2019s not related to is disgusting, but that just makes me question him and his family that that\u2019s their thought process.\n\nAITA? I just was worried about my literal three year old. Even if I am though, I\u2019m doing it again tonight. I just want to know because I\u2019m furious at him for blowing it out of proportion, but maybe he\u2019s right to be mad? Idk\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t think to add this but a comment made me think I should- Calli doesn\u2019t have free access to our room. Adam locks the door after I fall asleep, and because he\u2019s up and down all night, I can never stay up later than him. Calli has multiple times woken me up crying and banging on the door to get in after a bad dream, hearing weird noises, etc. Adam always apologizes but it keeps happening, so with her asthma I don\u2019t want to risk her being out in that cold for even a few minutes longer than she has too.\n\nAlso Adam won\u2019t buy another top that goes over the beds to keep in the heat. He says they\u2019re a waste of money/not worth the price. I bought two last year but our dog ripped it, and I didn\u2019t have the money to buy another one. I plan to after the new year when I have a full check so Calli can always have one in the cold, just in case.", "created_utc": 1671806256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zthav3/aita_because_i_slept_in_my_daughters_bed/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where they have the power go out in the middle of snow storms because of their cool \u201cTexas power grid\u201d. So they could have been in danger. \n\nWhy would she need to consult her husband? It\u2019s extenuating circumstances and the kid is three. The kid has her own bed but was 6 degrees outside. Who the hell stays warm alone in 6 degrees let especially a 3 year old??? Why wasn\u2019t he suggesting the same thing? He is legally her dad and should be just as worried.", "This. The red flags are blinding. Why does the same guy lock a kid out of a room but himself \"up and down\" all night. Lady you need to wake up.", "indeed.", "Just found it funny. I\u2019ve slept with a lot of women. Unfortunately I only slept with most of them xD", "It\u2019s extremely dangerous, especially at that age. Why have a child if you don\u2019t want to nurture and protect them?", "I do not think that's normal.  Closing the door maybe.  But why lock it?  Especially if you have a small child with asthma!", "but it is! Especially if on the other side there is a 3-year-old!", "Yea some parents are okay with it, but it\u2019s definitely not expected. My parents always sent me back to bed after I had a bad dream. After a couple times, they gave me a nightlight. Honestly can\u2019t complain, I loved that nightlight.", "Actually I'd have given you the bed, and slept on the floor myself.\n\nAlso the nightmare thing is an invalid argument. You don't plan for your kid to have a nightmare. But OP planned on the warm bedding idea, and it'd make sense to tell her husband ahead of time that they'd all be sleeping together that night in case of a power outtage.", "Hey, people always focus on who is the asshole, but no one bothers saying who is the Good Boy. \ud83d\udc36", "Your husband does not love your daughter like you think he does. She needs to be your top priority. What kind of cruel uncaring man locks the door for the sole purpose of not letting the daughter in when she\u2019s crying? That is not a good father. Stop letting your daughter suffer and see the situation for what it is. He does not see her as his daughter. It won\u2019t get better if you keep letting him treat her less than he would if she was biologically his.", "He's a cold man. He's super concerning", "Well that changes things, then. He should have known and also, if it was fine every other year why not this year? Yea, you're NTA", "So if you been doing this for 2 years and he had no issue with it than the issue has nothing to do with your daughter sleeping in the bed. \n\nThere's a reason he said he thinks you want to divorce him.  You two need to talk and find what the real issue here is because if he was fine for two years and upset now there's an underlying issue.", "Repeated behavior isn\u2019t a mistake; it\u2019s a choice. Your husband does not view your daughter as his. I bet this isn\u2019t the only red flag in your relationship.", "YTA for staying with this man.", "Hm, okay. NTA then.", "In order: \n\nNo idea.\n\nbecause he\u2019s her husband and legally the child\u2019s father. \n\nThe power didn\u2019t go out. \n\nBecause he doesn\u2019t feel it necessary or an emergency. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize it was 6 degrees. Now I\u2019m extra sure about what I said. It wasn\u2019t even below 0. They were in a warm house with blankets and clothes. Even if power had gone out, it would take time for the heat to completely dissipate. Nobody was actually in any danger.", "No it\u2019s not extremely dangerous. \n\nI didn\u2019t say lock the child in the child\u2019s room, which would be a major fire hazard. The parents have their door locked. The child is capable of knocking as I think OP mentioned. The child is in no more danger than if the door was unlocked and closed \n\nI don\u2019t think this has anything to do with an unwillingness to nurture and protect. And I find it shocking that you would characterize it that way. People can have different parenting styles than you without being monsters.", "Yeah she could have but why wouldn\u2019t he have thought of it too? He is Callie\u2019s dad (legally) and should also be thinking of her safety. I don\u2019t see why OP is the AH not for communicating this plan. How did the husband not think there would be some plan given the extenuating circumstances?? \n\nHaving a three year old at home means they will wake up in the night, have nightmares, and just need extra consideration. You don\u2019t and can\u2019t plan for all events and being a parent you will get unexpected things thrown your way. I don\u2019t even see how this would register as an unexpected surprise given the weather.", "Lol! I like how you hear six degrees and think \u201coh no big deal\u201d. I\u2019m currently wrapped in a big blanket with a space heater pointing at me and it\u2019s maybe 50 degrees outside. So my idea of cold is clearly very different from yours. I hear 6 degrees and think \u201cemergency!! We are all going to die!\u201d I\u2019m acclimated to Southern California cold so clearly my view is skewed. Lol! \n\nBut I have a kid that age so that why I don\u2019t see how this would be a big deal. I mean my kid came into my room around 3am last night because she was convinced the street light was the sun and it was time to play. So the husbands reaction is weird to me. Especially based on OP\u2019s comments that he locks the door after she falls asleep. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to live with a three year old despite living with one every day. \n\nOP said her daughter has asmtha and that\u2019s why she was so fearful. And it\u2019s hard not to be overly worried about your kids in some situations.", "It is a fire hazard to sleep with any bedroom door locked. Why would you as a parent be ok with there being a potential barrier between you and your child in the event of any kind of emergency? I have a lock on my bedroom door for if I need privacy but my child is 6 and I unlock it when I\u2019m sleeping.", "There are large amounts of Americans who live in places where 6 degrees is a normal low in winter. Like the 70k inhabitants of Bismarck, ND. Or 3.6 million people in MSP\u2019s metro. Everything is relative. \n\nSome people are just more strict than you about their kids being in their own beds at night. \n\nOP should have consulted with her husband and discussed what they wanted to do. Her being overly fearful isn\u2019t a reason that she should get to act unilaterally. If anything it\u2019s a reason she shouldn\u2019t get to act unilaterally.", "Oh I know my sense of cold is very skewed to literally everywhere else. Basically I never complain about the cold to anyone living anywhere else in the world. Lol!! \n\nAnd my kids only sleep with me in extenuating circumstances. Personally I don\u2019t like it and can\u2019t sleep myself. But then there are times as a parent you just do things you don\u2019t like because it\u2019s what the kid needs. When they are sick or in OP\u2019s case there are exceptions to rule. And their kid is three, it is about more than just being in danger. Was the kid scared? Did they need comfort because it was so cold? The husbands reaction is weird. Why be angry because he wasn\u2019t told? They have a kid. It is what it is and just part of parenthood. The kid is cold, has asmtha, there is a high likelihood of losing power. Why was he not also wanting what was best for Callie? I\u2019m looking sideways at the husband for not even caring a little but instead caring more about getting some \u201cloving\u201d. \n\nIf OP unilaterally decided the daughter sleeps with them every night then I would think that is way out of line and you can\u2019t make a decision like that without consulting the other parent. But a one-off night is something that just might happen with toddlers and less of a big deal IMO."]}
