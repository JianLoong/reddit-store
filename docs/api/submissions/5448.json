{"id": 5448, "submission_id": "zthav3", "title": "AITA because I slept in my daughter\u2019s bed?", "selftext": "Throwaway because my BIL follows my main\n\nI (25F) got married to my husband (24M) who we\u2019ll call Adam. When Adam and I were dating, I found out I was pregnant with my ex\u2019s kid. Adam didn\u2019t care and was thrilled because he\u2019s infertile, and has always wanted to be a dad. I tried for over a year to get in contact with my ex to see if he wanted to be a dad, and he nor his family ever answered me. Even when I went to their houses. So A has been my daughter\u2019s (3F who we\u2019ll call Calli) dad her whole life, and legally adopted her at 2. Sorry for the tangent, but it\u2019s relevant.\n\nWe\u2019re in freezing cold weather, and have lost power during higher temps than this the last two years. A kid in our neighborhood got really sick last year because he nearly froze. So I set up my and my husband\u2019s bed to be a kind of tent so it would keep all the body heat in. It\u2019s a California King, so there\u2019s PLENTY of room for us, Calli and our dog who sleeps with us anyway.\n\nI got Callie ready for bed, and tucked her in in our bed to finish getting ready. Adam asked why she was in our bed, and I explained I was afraid of the power going out because we\u2019ve already gotten warnings and the past two years. He was angry and said that he shouldn\u2019t have to share his bed with her because he might want \u201cloving\u201d. I told him that I wasn\u2019t going to be in the mood tonight because it\u2019s 6 degrees and I\u2019d be worried about Calli.\n\nLong story short, after a huge fight, I took the whole set up (so only leaving him the sheets, duvet and one blanket) and did it over my daughter\u2019s bed. I slept in there with her, and our dog followed us. Adam was so angry this morning that he accused me of wanting a divorce. I just told him that Calli was coming to work with me today, and I\u2019m dropping the dog off at my mother\u2019s since she works from home so he\u2019s not alone in case the power goes off. Adam went off to work and I\u2019m getting texts from my in laws and a couple mutual friends. Someone even texted me that expecting him to share a bed with a girl he\u2019s not related to is disgusting, but that just makes me question him and his family that that\u2019s their thought process.\n\nAITA? I just was worried about my literal three year old. Even if I am though, I\u2019m doing it again tonight. I just want to know because I\u2019m furious at him for blowing it out of proportion, but maybe he\u2019s right to be mad? Idk\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t think to add this but a comment made me think I should- Calli doesn\u2019t have free access to our room. Adam locks the door after I fall asleep, and because he\u2019s up and down all night, I can never stay up later than him. Calli has multiple times woken me up crying and banging on the door to get in after a bad dream, hearing weird noises, etc. Adam always apologizes but it keeps happening, so with her asthma I don\u2019t want to risk her being out in that cold for even a few minutes longer than she has too.\n\nAlso Adam won\u2019t buy another top that goes over the beds to keep in the heat. He says they\u2019re a waste of money/not worth the price. I bought two last year but our dog ripped it, and I didn\u2019t have the money to buy another one. I plan to after the new year when I have a full check so Calli can always have one in the cold, just in case.\n\nEdit 2: Our home is technically in a trust for me from my Aunt, but I\u2019m taking my and Calli\u2019s stuff and staying with my mom while working on how to make him leave. Our dog is already there. Adam has been blowing up my cell phone and work phone because I haven\u2019t apologized and I\u2019m ignoring his parents. My last straw was all the texts about him saying he wants to dissolve the adoption \u201cwhen I leave him\u201d because Calli doesn\u2019t respect him as her dad because she talks back, doesn\u2019t listen, runs away, has tantrums, and doesn\u2019t want to spend time with her if there\u2019s people besides us around (again, she\u2019s 3. Barely. She doesn\u2019t \u201crespect\u201d me most of the time either by his definition). I haven\u2019t responded to anything. I don\u2019t think I will for awhile.\n\nYes, we\u2019re in Texas so losing power is a constant stress.\n\nAdam has insomnia and has since he was a kid, which is why he gets up and down a lot. He has since we were kids. I\u2019ve known his family since I was like 10.\n\nThis is new behavior for him. Until about two months ago, he was perfect. He just randomly started locking the door, and he dots on her. His family has made it a point to let me know Calli isn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d their family, but we\u2019re LC with those that say that so it\u2019s a non-issue. Maybe he\u2019s back in contact with them though. Maybe he\u2019s upset about my new job, or that the house isn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d his. He won\u2019t discuss either of those things. I really don\u2019t know.\n\nHe\u2019s in therapy already.", "created_utc": 1671806256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zthav3/aita_because_i_slept_in_my_daughters_bed/", "score": 3424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Abusers often escalate when they think they're losing control of their victims.  You're no longer solely dependent on Adam.  You have your own income.  He refused to buy any bed tent but you're going to buy one anyway from your own income.  He can't stop you.

Normally they only allow a change in legal parents if there's someone else willing to step up - they view it as better for the child to have two people legally responsible for her.\n\nBut given your husband's and his family's twisted views and his unsafe behavior, it may be smarter in the long run to cooperate with him removing his name from her birth certificate if that's possible. Because then he can't legally force shared custody or visitation.  It will mean less money in your pocket since it will also absolve him of child support.  But raising a child on a shoestring budget is better than having her seriously ill, injured, or worse due to an abusive parent.\n\n>He\u2019s in therapy already.\n\nI hope he's only in solo therapy.

More therapy sessions and get an appointment with the GP for a health check up on everything to rule out any medical sources for his sudden personality change. Rule out BPD, Depression, Anxiety, tumors, intestinal issues, blood pressure, ANYTHING that can cause these kinds of mood swings. \n2. No more locking the bedroom door at night. Period.

I'd also check into possibly getting a restraining order, because of how fast this has escalated, and the fact he is framing the narrative that your child \"talks back/isn't respectful/doesn't listen\" when THEY ARE 3 YEARS OLD.

I'm not saying you shouldn't leave and figure that out, but it might also benefit to try and figure out what the thing is that's changed. It sounds like his family is speaking in his ear and pushing him their way, but there's no real way to know.\n\nAgain, that doesn't discount what's happening or what you should do...but the reality is if he's been perfect until 2 months ago you might want to try and figure out what the thing is, because this might not be **him**. People are way too quick to just divorce when shit goes south, when there could be something big in his life that's causing this change and ruining his mentality.", "I don't even understand it. What are they implying? Are they trying to say that the \"girl who is unrelated to him\" will come onto him or something? Or that he'll do something to that child? This is just so gross and concerning.", "And it definitely should stay that way", "Therapists can\u2019t diagnose BPD. I\u2019d do more research into this therapist because it sounds like they have something to do with it. If they\u2019re saying things they don\u2019t have the qualifications to, who knows what else they\u2019ve been saying", "It sounds like something serious is going on, and OP, you are not equipped to figure out what it is! Your asthmatic daughter doesn\u2019t deserve to freeze and get sicker in a house without heat while he behaves erratically and selfishly. Ask HIM to leave, but have some supportive friends and family there when you do to wait with you while he packs. If you leave the house, it will be harder to get him out.", "That\u2019s true I didn\u2019t think of that", "That is really sweet! Sounds like you have a lovely blended family. And you're so very right about small children, especially, needing access to parents at night. I'd have been scared to death if I couldn't get into my parents' room after a nightmare.", "There doesn't have to be a key? My parents bedroom locked from the inside but had nothing on the outside to open it. Us kids had knobs that locked similarly but had a slot like thing that you could put a coin or something in to unlock it in case of emergencies", "Even when you don't NORMALLY have a 3 year old in your bed, when the power goes out you let that 3 year old into your bed!!!\n\n\nA similar situation happened when MY daughter was around this age, the power went out late at night, in the cold, but we were all asleep. I was alerted by my toddler shrieking in terror at the absolute and sudden darkness.\n\n\nSo I sprint to her in the dark, snatch her up, and carry her to mine and daddy's bed, obviously.\n\n\nWe had never been bedsharers, so we're not accustomed to this. And I spent the night with a toddler wrapped around my head like a turban. But we were all warm, safe, and not scared, so mission accomplished!\n\n\nOP is NTA! Her husband deserves a divorce, and I hope OP is able to get the adoption dissolved somehow.", "The set up OP made for their bed even sounds like it could be a fun \"camping\" night as a family or whatever! It's something that could've been fun and bonding for all three of them together, but he just ruined the relationship instead.", "That's very true, I wouldn't be surprised if there's something more going on (mental or physical health issue, affair, addiction, who knows). But he's still treating her unhealthily and becoming controlling, and whether it will lead to physical abuse or not he shouldn't be around her child right now in my opinion, locking a 3 year old out of your room overnight regularly is neglectful.", "The whole wrong to sleep in the bed with her is so odd to me. If that\u2019s the case then the mom shouldn\u2019t be married to him. If j can trust you yo share a bed with ME and my child, you can\u2019t be trusted period.", "Yup, something like this happened to a relative of a friend of mine. Her husband suddenly got controlling and jealous after 10+ years of marriage when he had NEVER been that way before - turned out to be a brain tumor.", "Agreed, the daughters safety is number one priority, but if it was my spouse I would be *exceptionally* concerned for their well-being at this point.", "I\u2019m trying to decide which one is worse. Oy\u2026.", "Yeah, that's how I read it too but it still doesn't really make sense if he's up and down all night because of insomnia. There's really no reason he should lock the door or she shouldn't be able to stay up later", "That's fair I definitely would be too!", "I heard of an instance where something similar happened and the dad ended up being diagnosed with a brain tumor. Which changed his personality until they removed it.", "He's not a father, a husband or a man I would ever have around my child from that point on! She needs to get him to give up his rights to her daughter and then get a divorce - in that order - so that she no longer has to deal with him. The person who put the house in a trust for her REALLY protected her, because he won't be able to mount any legal challenges to get that house.", "I haven't had a natural period since like 2016. Not everyone is regular, dude.", "No, she should not wait for her daughter to potentionally be abused before leaving. She should just leave.", "Oh my god no XD", "You may want to read up on bipolar disorder. This sounds a lot like what a family member was doing im their late twenties/early thirties. It went off and on for years until they were diagnosed with bipolar. Those times when they were really irritable, demanding, driving like a maniac and blaming their spouse for weird, almost paranoid reasons- hypomania.", "Jumping in on this comment to talk about the worst autopsy I ever had to do, all because the parents locked the bedroom door of their two boys, aged 12 and 10. \n\nThe 10 year old was on the spectrum but also had a myriad of health problems. The parents were \"tired\" of being awakened in the night by the ten year old, so they decided to lock the boys in their room every night.\n\nOne night, the ten year old started coughing and choking, so his brother cried out to his parents for help, but they couldn't hear their sons cries, or their other son choking. When they unlocked the bedroom door the next morning, the 10 year old was dead from congestive heart failure, which is basically drowning in bed, while his brother was, and I'm sure is still, quite traumatized.\n\nAnd no, no charges were filed but IMHO, those parents should have been punished. Neither the child's nor the parent's doors should EVER be locked during the night. This is only one of hundreds of reasons why (ask a fireman for a hundred more) and I would not put up with it for one minute.", "This right here. I\u2019m in Texas as well so I know how OP is feeling. I have an almost 9 month old and last night I was up every hour checking we still had power and the specific temperature for his room. My husband isn\u2019t as worried as I am but also knows if the power goes out in the night he needs to start our propane heater well I bring the baby to our bed. If it\u2019s during the day we\u2019re fortunate to have a gas fireplace in our living room. We both dislike the baby sleeping in bed with us but we\u2019d rather that than put him in any kind of danger!", ">I spent the night with a toddler wrapped around my head like a turban. \n\nYou may have started a fashion trend.", "He either needs a physical doctor or a mental health professional who can prescribe meds. It could 100% be a mental illness, but if it is it sounds like it\u2019s not something that can be treated by talk therapy alone.", "Damn straight. He goes to sleep after her and wakes up in the night? What is the child's bedroom door a magical force field to stop him going in and doing something?\n\nNo. This is hugely concerning and needs to be thoroughly documented and taken to a divorce attorney.", "\"This is new behavior for him. Until about two months ago, he was perfect. \"\n\nThis really stands out.  He should be medically evaluated before anything.   There's a lot of pretty bad health things which have sudden onset of behavioral problems as a symptom", "Did he get into drugs? The up and down all night and irrational anger/responses are suspicious.", "As a child sexual assault survivor I am very concerned for this child. I hope nothing has already happened.", "What? You don't make any sense.", "This was my thought as well. Immediate ick", "So much this.", "Yes, it's like watching a scary movie and wanting to yell at the screen, \"Girl, get TF outta that house and take your sweet baby and pup with you!\" Then OP updates and I'm all, \"yesss!! She made it out safely and now I can go to bed.\" Dont go back to him OP. Doesnt matter how long you've known the family, toxic is toxic. Keep your little girl safe and loved and make sure to raise her knowing that we don't accept abuse from men. Keep doing the right thing for your daughter and of course NTA", "Since his behavior has abruptly changed I have to wonder why. He could be mentally or physically ill (I\u2019m wondering about a brain tumor). If his behavior has, indeed, suddenly changed, I\u2019m be worried.\n\nMeanwhile, keep your daughter away from him and be very careful yourself.", "1993 for the last state. :/", "Why don't you just take the lock off the door and replace it with a non-locking door knob? It's your house. No one here cares what his excuses are. His behavior can kill Calli, and that's what you need to focus on.", "The image of a 3-year-old girl banging on her mother's locked door in terror is heartbreaking. I would lose my ever-loving mind in rage if my partner did that more than once... I'd break the damn lock to make sure it never happend again. A child that small, especially one dealing with asthma should never be locked out (except maybe for a little sexy time after you've checked the kid's asleep). \n\nAs I recall in 2021, as we all watched Texas freezing its ass off, hundreds died in their beds, including an 11-year-old boy. Of course you are NTA for putting your child's welfare first. What a childish and selfish response your husband had to bringing her in bed with you. If he didn't like it, HE should've gone somewhere else. \n\nThe idea that he's fine with that little girl in a bed by herself, without the canopy that's keeping him warm shows he's all about himself. The man you married doesn't seem to regard this child as his actual daughter (how could he, when he's already told you he'd give her up if you divorce him?). If he's actually behaving differently in the past few months, it might be that he's cheating, or that your job threatens his control over you. Maybe he's always been half-assed about being a parent, and he faked it to get YOU. Maybe his weirdo relatives are soaking into his brain (why is he seeing more of them lately?). The why doesn't really matter. He's not being a good parent, so you have to be even better.\n\nBut you are absolutely in the right here, he's the one who owes YOU a giant apology at the very very least.  Don't let him bully you into putting up with his shitty behavior. Kid comes first.", "I sure did. Maybe English is tough for you.", "If a man that was courting the family\u2019s daughter had to stay overnight due to the late hour or weather or travel distance, even HE would sleep in the family bed. Granted they used a bundling board but that was REALLY not a relation and that was 18th century!", ">Adam always apologizes but it keeps happening\n\nI don't think OP is ***allowing*** it. I think it is happening and she is finally realizing it isn't an accident that keeps happening. I wouldn't blame her too hard for wanting to believe what her partner is saying to her. It takes trust to be in a relationship and I think she is now learning it was a misplaced trust. I wish her healing and I hope her child gets all the mommy time she needs now.", "\u201cSex vending machine\u201d sounds like a very bizarre concept separated from context.", "My eldest asthma is almost completely controlled. He didn't need an inhaler once from April of this year - until we had a bad cold snap and suddenly he needed it every night. \n\nGood lord I wonder how she's managed to co parent with this monster. There's been so many times the kids have been sick while small and needed to sleep on a parent. That poor baby.", "I read it as if she tries to stay up later than him to be sure the door isn't locked, she'll never succeed.", "6 years of sleep deprivation for me between my two kids and I wouldn't trade it for anything. I loved having my kids stay in the bed with their mother and me. \n\nI legitimately believe that we bonded better and have a more personal and affectionate relationship as a result than I ever had with my parents. Completely worth it.", ">but it just does some damage under the surface if that makes sense.\n\nI'm sorry you went through that. I had a similar problem with my mom and step dad locking me out of the room when I was little. I have horrific nightmares. Like, still. I tell my husband about them and he shivers because they're so frightening/creepy. I've had that level of nightmare since I was a child. I would bang and knock on my mom's door when I had these terrifying nightmares and she'd say \"it was a dream, go to sleep\" and not even get up to hug me. Of course I knew it was a dream, I wasn't stupid. But the nightmares are so horrifying that to this day when I have them, I wake up for hours and have to calm myself down and every phobia I have is a PTSD from some nightmare (like, who the eff is afraid of snails? Me, because the squelching sound they made in the nightmare 20 years ago).  I developed a life-long fear of the dark and cannot sleep without lights on and I think it is from not having comfort when I had nightmares. I don't think I ever learned how to comfort myself from the nightmares and so they still scare me to this day.", "Also that implies that they see her as a potential sexual option for him. The implications being:\n\n1. She will tempt him. \n\n2. He will sexually abuse her. \n\n3. He\u2019s worried he will be accused of the abuse. \n\nNONE OF THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING POSITIVE TO THINK ABOUT A TODDLER\u2019S LEGAL GUARDIAN.", "One of the worst and most damaging things to children was \u2018Stranger Danger\u2019 because it is true that children are more likely to be harmed by family or people close to the family.", "Could be a brain tumor. He needs a thorough check up.
