{"id": 5448, "submission_id": "zthav3", "title": "AITA because I slept in my daughter\u2019s bed?", "selftext": "Throwaway because my BIL follows my main\n\nI (25F) got married to my husband (24M) who we\u2019ll call Adam. When Adam and I were dating, I found out I was pregnant with my ex\u2019s kid. Adam didn\u2019t care and was thrilled because he\u2019s infertile, and has always wanted to be a dad. I tried for over a year to get in contact with my ex to see if he wanted to be a dad, and he nor his family ever answered me. Even when I went to their houses. So A has been my daughter\u2019s (3F who we\u2019ll call Calli) dad her whole life, and legally adopted her at 2. Sorry for the tangent, but it\u2019s relevant.\n\nWe\u2019re in freezing cold weather, and have lost power during higher temps than this the last two years. A kid in our neighborhood got really sick last year because he nearly froze. So I set up my and my husband\u2019s bed to be a kind of tent so it would keep all the body heat in. It\u2019s a California King, so there\u2019s PLENTY of room for us, Calli and our dog who sleeps with us anyway.\n\nI got Callie ready for bed, and tucked her in in our bed to finish getting ready. Adam asked why she was in our bed, and I explained I was afraid of the power going out because we\u2019ve already gotten warnings and the past two years. He was angry and said that he shouldn\u2019t have to share his bed with her because he might want \u201cloving\u201d. I told him that I wasn\u2019t going to be in the mood tonight because it\u2019s 6 degrees and I\u2019d be worried about Calli.\n\nLong story short, after a huge fight, I took the whole set up (so only leaving him the sheets, duvet and one blanket) and did it over my daughter\u2019s bed. I slept in there with her, and our dog followed us. Adam was so angry this morning that he accused me of wanting a divorce. I just told him that Calli was coming to work with me today, and I\u2019m dropping the dog off at my mother\u2019s since she works from home so he\u2019s not alone in case the power goes off. Adam went off to work and I\u2019m getting texts from my in laws and a couple mutual friends. Someone even texted me that expecting him to share a bed with a girl he\u2019s not related to is disgusting, but that just makes me question him and his family that that\u2019s their thought process.\n\nAITA? I just was worried about my literal three year old. Even if I am though, I\u2019m doing it again tonight. I just want to know because I\u2019m furious at him for blowing it out of proportion, but maybe he\u2019s right to be mad? Idk\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t think to add this but a comment made me think I should- Calli doesn\u2019t have free access to our room. Adam locks the door after I fall asleep, and because he\u2019s up and down all night, I can never stay up later than him. Calli has multiple times woken me up crying and banging on the door to get in after a bad dream, hearing weird noises, etc. Adam always apologizes but it keeps happening, so with her asthma I don\u2019t want to risk her being out in that cold for even a few minutes longer than she has too.\n\nAlso Adam won\u2019t buy another top that goes over the beds to keep in the heat. He says they\u2019re a waste of money/not worth the price. I bought two last year but our dog ripped it, and I didn\u2019t have the money to buy another one. I plan to after the new year when I have a full check so Calli can always have one in the cold, just in case.\n\nEdit 2: Our home is technically in a trust for me from my Aunt, but I\u2019m taking my and Calli\u2019s stuff and staying with my mom while working on how to make him leave. Our dog is already there. Adam has been blowing up my cell phone and work phone because I haven\u2019t apologized and I\u2019m ignoring his parents. My last straw was all the texts about him saying he wants to dissolve the adoption \u201cwhen I leave him\u201d because Calli doesn\u2019t respect him as her dad because she talks back, doesn\u2019t listen, runs away, has tantrums, and doesn\u2019t want to spend time with her if there\u2019s people besides us around (again, she\u2019s 3. Barely. She doesn\u2019t \u201crespect\u201d me most of the time either by his definition). I haven\u2019t responded to anything. I don\u2019t think I will for awhile.\n\nYes, we\u2019re in Texas so losing power is a constant stress.\n\nAdam has insomnia and has since he was a kid, which is why he gets up and down a lot. He has since we were kids. I\u2019ve known his family since I was like 10.\n\nThis is new behavior for him. Until about two months ago, he was perfect. He just randomly started locking the door, and he dots on her. His family has made it a point to let me know Calli isn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d their family, but we\u2019re LC with those that say that so it\u2019s a non-issue. Maybe he\u2019s back in contact with them though. Maybe he\u2019s upset about my new job, or that the house isn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d his. He won\u2019t discuss either of those things. I really don\u2019t know.\n\nHe\u2019s in therapy already.", "created_utc": 1671806256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zthav3/aita_because_i_slept_in_my_daughters_bed/", "score": 588, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
