Everything is great. His roommate is a nice guy, but weird. He has a pet tarantula that he puts on display in the dining room. Now I\u2019m afraid of all bugs, im the person who will run the other direction if I see a bug. Spiders? I\u2019m setting the whole place on fire.\n\nInitially when I started coming over, they agreed to move the spider to his room for the time being. I use the dining room to work from while my boyfriend is in meeting and recording things in his room. \n\nThen his roommate said that moving the spider so much was bad for it( I literally come over one or twice a week????). So fine, they left it out. That disgusting vermin was out by the window every time I was in the room. And it\u2019s fucking eye level to so I see it regardless where I sit. I refuse to sit with my back to it bc I can FEEL it there and every time I pass by it I get panicked. \n\nLike I KNOW it won\u2019t do anything to me, but seeing it and being in it\u2019s proximity freaks me out. My BF suggested covering up the little window so I don\u2019t see it. Perfect. Can\u2019t see it, feels like it\u2019s not there. I guess he didn\u2019t tell his roommate he was going to do that because he came in all pissed off and started a fight about it because you\u2019re not supposed to \u201cobstruct its view\u201d?!?! And is saying it\u2019s abusive what we\u2019re doing?!? IM SORRY FUCKING WHAT?!?!\n\nHis roommate wants me to just suck it up and not be fucking afraid of a spider when this bitch is a germaphobe and refuses to clean dishes bc he doesn\u2019t like touching wet food.\n\nLike who is in the wrong here? Like what am I supposed to do? Worse yet I feel like my bc is taking his roommate\u2019s side that I should relax around it?!?!  Like I don\u2019t want to break up with my bf over his roommate\u2019s fucking spider but if this continue I fucking might \ud83d\ude2d\n\n\nOk edit:\n\nSeeing it being super divided and lots of confusion. Y\u2019all, I go there once a week SOMETIMES BUT RARELY TWICE. I work from the dining room bc there\u2019s no other space I can work from, and if I\u2019m in a meeting I\u2019m not going to take it from sitting on the couch??? I work remotely. My job is FULLY remote. \n\nI maybe slept there once in the year he\u2019s been living there. I barely ever see the roommate, and usually leave before he comes home. When he is home I make sure to leave so he has time alone at home. \n\nMy BF comes over to my place once a week to work remotely and we hang out afterwards. Like why is everyone assume I\u2019m there all the time?\n\nEdit 2: Id like to clarify that I\u2019d never hurt and animal and obviously I\u2019d never hurt someone else\u2019s pet. I\u2019m dramatic when it comes to my fear of bugs. I HATE THEM. It was a poor choice of words and obviously I wouldn\u2019t hurt the damn spider, I\u2019m too afraid to even look in its direction bc it gives me the fucking creeps and I\u2019d it ever got out I\u2019d run out of there fast. I have no problems with any other animal. Snakes? Sure I\u2019ve held several. Rats? Love them. But anything that has more than four legs??? Nope. I can\u2019t fucking do it\n\nEdit 3: since majority is in agreement that IATA in this situation, I will let my bf know I\u2019m no longer coming over to his place bc I\u2019m still afraid of the spider and uncomfortable being there.

There are a lot of things that people are entitled to do in their own homes, regardless of whether outsiders approve. No one is making you visit.

Not your place.", "YTA. Tarantulas are awesome pets. They\u2019re out in the wild seasonally where I live, they\u2019re no problem to handle, and I\u2019ve never heard of one biting anyone.

Zero room to dictate where to put it. You are absolutely allowed to be afraid of it, but you are absolutely being unreasonable about it here.   \nIt's a tarantula. They are kept in an enclosed space, it's not a free roam animal. A lot of tarantulas prefer to hide and are mostly active at night, anyways. If you hate it so much that just being around something with no access to you freaks you out, maybe don't go over there anymore? Or go over only in the daytime? Maybe also check out methods of working on how you react to things you fear, because this really is not a rational response to somebody's pet that is kept in an enclosure. It's like getting scared of a goldfish living in a bowl, it can't do anything to you! I get that not every fear and reaction will be rational but it's up to you to work on possibly improving that. You don't have to love spiders and tarantulas, but if you want to keep going over to your boyfriend's place, you will need to work on being able to tolerate being in the same room as a confined one. You don't have to love and be friendly with it, just learn how to cope with it existing.", "YTA. Do you pay rent? No? Then STFU.", "As much as I empathize with disgust and fear reactions to spiders and bugs alike, unfortunately YTA here. \n\nDespite this judgement I will say it sounds like this roommate is going out of his way to try and make you uncomfortable. That's not appropriate but it also sounds like his own childish and rude way of signalling to you that you shouldn't be trying to stake as much claim over a living space that isn't yours to begin with. As in, this is his petty way of saying you have overextended your welcome in his eyes in a living space that he pays for. \n\nEasiest way to drive home how serious this is for you? **Stop going over there.** Your bf will be left to do the actual work of devising accommodations for you in a shared living space that aren't upsetting his roommate's boundaries that should have happened in the first place instead of all this passive aggressive ridiculousness coming from all sides. If he doesn't care enough to put in the effort so that y'all can all continue co-existing in this space like adults, take that as a clear sign this relationship was never going to work out and enjoy single living without the constant fear of having to be in the same space as a tarantula. \n\nI'm honestly shocked y'all have all developed this silly dynamic for so long without a single adult conversation happening about this. I doubt you're the last person that'll ever come over that's going to have a fear/disgust reaction to the tarantula. What's the game plan for future guests that react that way? Will it suddenly be totally fine for the tarantula's health to go back into the bedroom? \n\nIf you're desperate to keep hanging out at his place for whatever reason, then y'all need to sit down as a group and YOU should be the one to apologize first and offer a compromise that'll make your roommate feel less animosity to your consistent presence. The EASIEST and most straightforward compromise I can think of is: if roommate keeps his pet out of the common space when you're over, then you do the dishes he leaves in the sink before you go. If something like that doesn't cut it and he simply doesn't want you around, then respect that and stop showing up to their place. If your bf wants to keep you, then he'll make the trip to yours.

I\u2019m setting the whole place on fire.\n\nInitially when I started coming over, they agreed to move the spider to his room for the time being. I use the dining room to work from while my boyfriend is in meeting and recording things in his room. \n\nThen his roommate said that moving the spider so much was bad for it( I literally come over one or twice a week????). So fine, they left it out. That disgusting vermin was out by the window every time I was in the room. And it\u2019s fucking eye level to so I see it regardless where I sit. I refuse to sit with my back to it bc I can FEEL it there and every time I pass by it I get panicked. \n\nLike I KNOW it won\u2019t do anything to me, but seeing it and being in it\u2019s proximity freaks me out. My BF suggested covering up the little window so I don\u2019t see it. Perfect. Can\u2019t see it, feels like it\u2019s not there. I guess he didn\u2019t tell his roommate he was going to do that because he came in all pissed off and started a fight about it because you\u2019re not supposed to \u201cobstruct its view\u201d?!?! And is saying it\u2019s abusive what we\u2019re doing?!? IM SORRY FUCKING WHAT?!?!\n\nHis roommate wants me to just suck it up and not be fucking afraid of a spider when this bitch is a germaphobe and refuses to clean dishes bc he doesn\u2019t like touching wet food.\n\nLike who is in the wrong here? Like what am I supposed to do? Worse yet I feel like my bc is taking his roommate\u2019s side that I should relax around it?!?!

She's also all up in the comments acting suuuuuuper entitled on top of actin entitled to begin with about a place that she doesn't pay rent but she expects to cater to her wants.
