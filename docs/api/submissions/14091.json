She should also be cleaning out things that clog like vacuums.\n\nExpecting others to deal with your bodily functions is just gross.\n\nIf you were shaving and leaving it in the sink, it would be the same - your problem", "NTA. I lived with 5 men Sharing 2 showers (I\u2019m a female) and we ALL were responsible for cleaning our hair off the drains and the walls. They also got hair in there, or beard hair all over the sinks and you bet we were all on top of the others if they forgot because that\u2019s just common courtesy. Show her these responses, she needs to grow up and get in the habit of wiping the drain real quick whenever she gets out. Common courtesy. She sounds selfish tbh", "NTA. Her hair, her responsibility and frankly, if she can't pony up \u00a34 to alieviate the issue HER hair is causing? Well then she's a gigantic AH and a really shit roommate.", "NTA. The onus on keeping HER hair off and out of everything is on her. I'd tell her that next time you have to clean out her hair, you're leaving it in her room.", "NTA. If she is refusing to clean up after herself I have a couple of suggestions that may be petty though.\n\n1. If you find a hairball in the drain, pull it out and put it in her room with a note saying \"This is yours, wanted to return it\"\n\n2. If there is a hairball in the drain, go knock on her door (no matter what time) and ask her to remove it and don't leave or give up until she does.\n \nShe is an adult. She is responsible for taking care of her hair and ensuring no one else in the household is inconvenienced by it. It is her problem, she should be sorting it out.", "NTA. Am a girl with long hair. This comes with the territory of having long hair. The hairs around the house are hard to prevent, but it\u2019s not hard to make sure the shower drain is clear. She\u2019s 18 and this is a maturity thing, but she needs to learn how to clean up after herself. As an aside, I find it a little concerning that she\u2019s shedding enough to clog the shower that frequently though.", "NTA.\n\nI'm male, with long hair. My hair is thin, and breaks pretty easily, so I end up with my hair everywhere, so I freaking clean it up. I make sure to check the washer/dryer and clean up my hair, I clean my hair out of the shower drain, etc. because it's just fucking gross to not do that, and it's no one else's responsibility but my own.\n\nShe's 18, it's time for her to start learning to clean up after herself too. She's got to learn to be an adult as she grows up and goes out on her own, and a big part of that is cleaning up after yourself. Gross ass, drain clogging piles of wet, slimy hair are disgusting when it's your own hair. It's ten times worse when it's not even your hair. Not your damn responsibility to clean up.", "NTA. As a person with long hair, I'd be so embarrassed if my roomates had to take care of what came off of me. Her hair, her problem. Not yours. She should very much take care of her own hair. If she can't, she should consider chopping it off. I know I have.", "NTA, I have pretty long (unfortunately not thick) hair and yeah, in the showerdrain is disgusting and just awefull to clean out. NTA for trying to find a solution.\n\nAround the entire house would have been a real trouble and nuisance for her, even with my hair up and bound together all the time, it still gets around. But you are not asking that of her, you accept the loose hair around the house and as something that she can not be considerate of. \n\nBut this ONE thing she can be considerate of, and this is her response. That just sucks and makes her TA for her reaction and consideration of one thing.", "NTA \n\nMy daughter and I both have long thick hair with 4 boys/men in the house, it\u2019s our job for them to not have to deal with our hair everywhere. That means sweeping and vacuuming quite often. We also had to put one of those covers in the kids bathroom as the hair kept getting trapped, even with those, some still slip down the drain. It grosses me out to clean those hair balls out and it\u2019s my own hair. Tell her to get her shit together and clean up after herself", "NTA - I also have lots of very long hair, and I also live with a man, and I own a shower hair catcher. \n\nBecause I believe a general rule of thumb is only I should have to deal with the things that come off or from my body.", "NTA-I also have long hair and wouldn't expect anyone to deal with it.", "NtA - My poor husband is the only man in our house with two grown daughters and you'd better believe everyone cleans their own hair off that hair catcher in the shower. If not, we make whoever just took a shower come back in and clean it up. It's a solid rule and my girls will even go after each other.", "Oh, also, when you condition your hair and run your fingers through it. If there is hair on your hands, don't put it down the drain, put it in the bin.", "NTA. Your mother maid! It\u2019s unsanitary and disgusting! Tell her adults clean up after themselves.", "NTA; as a woman with decent length hair, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong here. It\u2019s her hair and her job to control/clean up after herself and I\u2019m sorry you had to clean up her gross hair balls! Idk how much longer y\u2019all have to share the place but until that ends I would invest in the shower mushroom as well as a couple lint rollers", "NTA. And while she can't stop all strays, keeping it tied up will lessen the hair fall. Buying the drain screen is cheaper than moving, but won't help much if she doesn't clean it after each shower.", "NTA  It's not your hair.  The shared shower needs to be operational and sanitary.  If that drain gets clogged, it will be neither.  AND it will cost more than \u00a34 for a plumber.  \n\nYou're not asking her to vaccum thrice daily. You're not asking her to wear a hair net in the house.  You're asking her to clean up after her damn self.", "Likely NTA, you literally went out of your way to find an easy and cheap solution and she still got mad. The only thing that can\u2019t be known through text is the tone you used when saying these things.", "I have fine hair but it goes EVERYWHERE. My daughter is mixed race and has very thick hair, so between us we clog up drains. We have a drain sieve, but it doesn't totally work. I buy the super thick drain unblocker that comes with the meter long stick. Once you use that stick once you will never be the same again \ud83e\udd23. That hair slop stinks! So I don't think it's fair fine hair or thick dark hair. Clean your drains, it's everyone's responsibility.", "NAH \\~ You did well by communicating it to her. I have long hair too and yes it just falls out, even more when washing my hair. Once a week seems fair, communicate this to her though and give her that chance to actually do it.   \nI dont think the item within that link will make a change, she will not clean that thingy if she doesn't even clean the current hairballs.", "There is nothing she can do about shedding all over the place. That's a fact that people with hair live with.   \nThe hairball is disgusting but she can do something about that. The mushroom is a good compromise. They work well.  \nNTA but just buy the mushroom. It's only 3.99.", "replace her shampoo with nair. no more hair! problem solved", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
