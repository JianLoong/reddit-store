{"id": 27178, "submission_id": "16mo29h", "title": "AITA for skipping my sister\u2019s competition for my brother and causing the entire family to fight?", "selftext": "I (15m) have two siblings, my older brother and sister (both 18). They have a good relationship. I have a really good relationship with both of my siblings as well.\n\nMy sister is kind of an overachiever, like she\u2019s an all rounder, wins awards for all subjects and has crazy high grades. My brother on the other hand is an average student, and doesn\u2019t really take anything seriously. He just goofs off during class and at home but he\u2019s really passionate about theater and dedicates hours upon hours on it. My parents don\u2019t approve of my brother\u2019s love for theater and they\u2019re constantly telling him to pick up another passion. \n\nMy sister recently participated in a robotics competition.  She was working for it like crazy in the past months to prepare for it and was extremely nervous. My brother coincidentally also had a performance during that time and I know he\u2019d been practicing like hell because he came home late almost everyday in the months leading up to it as well.\n\nThe date for my sisters competition was announced after my brothers performance date was confirmed. My brother got into a major fight with my parents because they said they would be going to my sisters competition to support her instead of my brothers performance.\n\nA few days ago was the day of the performance and the competition. I was supposed to go to the venue myself to meet my parents who would be there earlier for the competition. But I felt really bad about skipping my brothers performance because nobody would be going. So instead of going to the competition I told my parents I would go watch his performance instead.\n\nMy brother was obviously disappointed that no one else showed up but was happy to see me I think. Both the competition and the performance went well but my brother was giving my parents the silent treatment during dinner. After everyone went to bed my parents say they wanted to talk to me.\n\nThey said that my sister was really sad that I didn\u2019t show up to her competition because I knew how important it was to her. That made her more upset during the competition and maybe caused her to do slightly worse than she could have. They told me to prioritize better because while my sisters competition was so important that it could decide what college she went to, my brothers was just a performance for school.\n\nMyy sister became more snippy with me and she suddenly had an outburst about it and got into a huge fight with my brother (I don\u2019t really know what they shouted about though). Now everyone\u2019s relationship is strained and my parents told me that it\u2019s probably my fault for creating all of this drama, and I shouldve went for the competition like they wanted to. I still think what I did was right but I think I need an outsiders point of view.

Keep supporting your brother - lord knows he needs someone in his corner!  And sis has an extreme case of main character syndrome - tell her it's not a good look on her and that a touch of humility/compassion would go a long way.", "Nta your parents are playing favorites and how disappointing for your brother. And some your sister got snippy, clearly she knows it. \n\nCouldn't one parent go to robotics and the other go to theater? Good for you for showing up for your brother.", "NTA. \n\nYou're a good brother. I highly doubt that your siblings have a good relationship and I would recommend you talk with your brother about this because I'm 100% positive that there is an entire side to this you don't know. \n\nYour parents have a golden child and it's your sister. If you look up \"Golden Child\" on this sub you will see what that means for you and your brother going forward. \n\nPiece of Advice; You and your Brother need to stick together. Don't let them divide you.", "NTA your brother will always remember that you stand up for him meanwhile the golden child will only remember you if she needs something from you. You're an amazing little brother, continue like that <3", "NTA - your parents are though, they should have done 1 at sisters competition and 1 at the brothers performance. Even if they put higher value on robotics over theater, if that's what your brother wants to do then this could also shape his future as well.\n\nYour siblings also should have just realised it's a bad situation so shouldn't be mad at each other or you.\n\nI think you're the only one who's done the right thing in all of this.", "NTA-Let them continue to fawn all over the golden child. That usually turns out so well /s. You did the right thing for your brother.", "They are what? Sad that you miss one of the many things of your sister for this one important thing of your brother. You're absolutely NTA. And good that your brother has someone that supports his passion. It is not just a school performance for him considering it is his passion and he worked hard for it. And your sister is not going to perform worse because you weren't there. That is absolutely bs\n \nYour parents made this drama happen. They could have split who goes to which thing, but clearly don't care for your brother. And I feel very bad for him. (And low key hope that he goes low contacr with everyone but you for his mental health)", "YNTA but your parents and sister sure are", "NTA regardless of which event you attended.  It was nice of you to support your brother since neither of your parents did.  Also the strained relations in your house are not your fault.", "NTA. Parents are the major AHs by making sister the golden child.  Doing so poisons the relationships and family bonds of all involved.\n\nOP did the right thing by being there for brother.  He is not disposable, nor is he an afterthought.", "NTA and you did the right thing otherwise your brother would\u2019ve felt deserted and rightly so", "NTA. You did the right thing. Other hand your parents are TA and so is your sister. Your telling your brother too get another passion which theater is your brother's passion. That is just down right being mean. So many people are not cut out for sports and some get no support from their parents when they want to join the school theater group. How many people have talent like acting that is suppressed by parents. It is an art and people excel in doing this. I know I am rambling.", "NTA, your poor brother though, your sister is selfish to expect the whole family to go to her thing and no one show up for you brother, your parents are unfair to expect the same, you did the best thing for the situation in front of you", "NTA,\n\nYour parents are playing favourites, and thst is just plain wrong.\n\nYou were right to support you brother.\n\nThe drama is causdd by your parents, not you.", "NTA. If your sister's performance in anything drops because you aren't there (but your brother's presence doesn't make a difference) then that's a *her* problem.\n\nShe flubbed her competition, you were a convenient scapegoat. Keep supporting your brother, apparently your parents have your sister covered.", "NTA both parents already at her event you not do anything wrong by attend your brother event.", "NTA, you're sis is spoilt and is clearly the favourite child! Your brother needs MORE support than she does, his low achievements are probably due to the dismissal and disapproval of your parents.  Good on you for making him a little happier.", "Oh, honey! Thank you so much, for caring for your brother, who must have felt so abandoned and rejected by your thoughtless parents. And here's news for robot-building sister; if she can't handle not receiving the undivided attention of her entire family, she'll never survive the pressures of college, especially a competitive one like she dreams of attending.\n\nYour parents are being grotesquely unfair and short-sighted with your brother; he's found something he loves and can excel at. He's not the same as your sister, which should be great, they're not competing with each other, except for your parents' love and approval. The correct thing for parents to have done was one go to each child's thing, but Golden Child sister thought she was entitled to EVERYONE cheering her on. So sad. Keep supporting your brother, it will make a difference in both your lives.", "NTA, you are at no fault at all. your parents are the prime example of someone feeding one of their kids with a golden spoon while neglecting the other.", "NTA. I hope you realize that the fact that your parents somehow think that the *youngest person in the house* is wholly responsible for the current environment in the house is absolutely ridiculous. The current dynamic is 100% their making and fault, so don\u2019t blame yourself and don\u2019t let them blame you either.", "Your parents and sister are the AHs here. She had her parents, she didn't need you. She just wanted all the attention. Your parents encourage this. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your brother 's performance was important too. It may be school thing and not that important but it is still important for you. You are great.", "NTA. Your parents clearly favor your sister and unfortunately she has become entitled due to their actions. I'm betting you made your brothers day by showing up for his performance. Your sister should also be glad someone showed up for  her brothers performance instead of being selfish about it. But honestly, this entire problem lays at your parents feet.", "NTA and you should be proud of yourself for being a better person than your parents and sister. You did the right thing by supporting your brother. It seems like you and your brother will need to continue this through life because your sister will always be a priority to your parents.", "NTA. Your parents were horrible and manipulating you when they said your siblings fight were your fault. It's your parents because they are playing favorites and being horrible to you and your brother.\n\nIt was really nice that you could support your brother. Dont bother about your sister, UNFORTUNATELY your parents made her think she is the only important person in the family. She needs some reality check", "NTA. Your parents are wrong \u2013 it's THEIR fault for creating drama.", "Why didn't your brother cancel his performance so that he could also attend his siter's event?? /s\n\n You're a great brother and definitely NTA!", "NTA.  You didn't create the drama, your parents did.  Favoritism won't go away since it has been 18 years.  But you get to be a kind, real person in this situation.  Kindness and compassion in life will go a long way.  Don't doubt yourself, you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nEveryone should be happy to have a Little brother like you. You did Great and please continue being a decent Human being.", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing.  Divide and conquer in these situations.  Your sister shouldn't have fallen apart just because everyone wasn't there.  Both of her parents were, for heaven's sake.\n\nYour brother won't forget this.  He'll always remember that you supported him, even if he doesn't in fact end up in show biz.\n\nBy the way, I think this is damaging to your Sis as well.  She's probably so scared of not performing at top level that she's going to get herself sick.", "No it is not your fault. Actually it's their fault.\n\nThey prioritised your sister. So rather than leave your brother with no support you went to watch him. They should be happy someone was there to support him. But clearly he is not their golden child.\n\nYour sister may have under performed but that isn't because you weren't there. What nonsense. Perhaps the other kids were better than her? And she is snippy because she wanted everyone there regardless of your brother's needs. She is probably used to being the centre of the world for everyone. \n\nNTA", "NTA. How awful are your parents to pin the fall out on you . They want an all or nothing relationship with their own children and within the kids themselves. \nI\u2019m petty but I hope your brother becomes a famous actor and if he wins an Oscar, he\u2019ll only mention you", "NTA but your parents are TA because they have a golden child. Nothing the two of you do will ever measure up to what your sister does. So look out for each other. You have your brother and he has you. Your sister has your parents. Stick with your brother and don\u2019t expect your parents to change. They won\u2019t. I am speaking from experience.", "NTA - your parents show clear favouritism. That is very unfortunate.
