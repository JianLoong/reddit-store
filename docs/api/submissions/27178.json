They have a good relationship. I have a really good relationship with both of my siblings as well.\n\nMy sister is kind of an overachiever, like she\u2019s an all rounder, wins awards for all subjects and has crazy high grades. My brother on the other hand is an average student, and doesn\u2019t really take anything seriously. He just goofs off during class and at home but he\u2019s really passionate about theater and dedicates hours upon hours on it. My parents don\u2019t approve of my brother\u2019s love for theater and they\u2019re constantly telling him to pick up another passion. \n\nMy sister recently participated in a robotics competition.  She was working for it like crazy in the past months to prepare for it and was extremely nervous. My brother coincidentally also had a performance during that time and I know he\u2019d been practicing like hell because he came home late almost everyday in the months leading up to it as well.\n\nThe date for my sisters competition was announced after my brothers performance date was confirmed. My brother got into a major fight with my parents because they said they would be going to my sisters competition to support her instead of my brothers performance.\n\nA few days ago was the day of the performance and the competition. I was supposed to go to the venue myself to meet my parents who would be there earlier for the competition. But I felt really bad about skipping my brothers performance because nobody would be going. So instead of going to the competition I told my parents I would go watch his performance instead.\n\nMy brother was obviously disappointed that no one else showed up but was happy to see me I think. Both the competition and the performance went well but my brother was giving my parents the silent treatment during dinner. After everyone went to bed my parents say they wanted to talk to me.\n\nThey said that my sister was really sad that I didn\u2019t show up to her competition because I knew how important it was to her. That made her more upset during the competition and maybe caused her to do slightly worse than she could have. They told me to prioritize better because while my sisters competition was so important that it could decide what college she went to, my brothers was just a performance for school.\n\nMyy sister became more snippy with me and she suddenly had an outburst about it and got into a huge fight with my brother (I don\u2019t really know what they shouted about though). Now everyone\u2019s relationship is strained and my parents told me that it\u2019s probably my fault for creating all of this drama, and I shouldve went for the competition like they wanted to.

Finally got to high school and started doing theatre there, then went on to get my first college degree in theatre. \n\nYour parent\u2019s attitude that theater isn\u2019t a legitimate thing compared to STEM fields (and sports) is sadly pretty strong. I remember being told my education was a hobby and having literally thousands of dollars in school funding being diverted from the theater department for football. It\u2019s rough enough without your own parents not being there for you. My mom didn\u2019t show up for the closing performance of a show I was in because she was too busy binging Dexter. She hadn\u2019t shown up for any of the other performances either.\n\nYou backed your brother when you knew he needed it.

All you did was have his back, and maybe that did give him the confidence to argue with your sister, but I don't think that's a bad thing in this instance.", "Your definitely NTA but your parents are both huge ones. They prioritized one child over the other when one parent could have each attended a different child\u2019s activity. The good news is that you and your brother can now see where you both stand in your parents eyes and can plan your lives accordingly.

You did an incredibly kind thing for your brother, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it was your parents complaining about you missing the robotics and not helping her perform better is what set your sister off.

It should have been either go see the brother's performance, or split the family to attend both. \n\nThe fact that they're so dismissive of your brother's passion is concerning. And that whole thing about the competition being about getting into college but the performance being 'just' for school? Bs, that performance, along with any others, could get your brother into a good college, too. \n\nThis is extremely dismissive of your brother in every way. They see him as less important than his sister, always prioritise your sister over him. I'm sure your brother was ecstatic that he had one family member that supported him enough to show up. Your sister probably didn't even notice you weren't there until your parents brought it up. I'm sorry, but if she's reliant on the entire family being present for everything she does, she's not going to succeed in life, no matter how good she is. \n\nGood on you for being there for your brother. Tell your sister to grow up and stop demanding special treatment at the expense of her brother.

I wonder what else they blame you for. I also wonder what they told your sister about all this. Your brother has the right to be supported by loved ones in his activities and interests and you did the right thing by chosing to go support him. The sister already had two people supporting her and that was enough. It sounds like the sister is the golden child though and there is no fighting that . . . and it sounds like maybe OP is the scapegoat and his brother is the invisible child. In a family like that you need to find others who will support you and cheer for you on the sidelines.", "NTA. Good for you showing up for his show.

It sounds like there is always another major event for her. She is doing this stuff to better her life. Her failure or success at any competition is on her. When she is off at college, are you going to be there during finals to support her? Does she make it to your events? Clearly she is not making to anything your brother does.  I\u2019m not saying she is a bad person but the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her\u2026", "NTA, your parents are going about this all wrong. Shame on them for not supporting your brother\u2019s passions.", "NTA.\n\nWow, this is Bad Parenting 101.\n\nFirst they are playing favourites with their kids, which is straight away a bad move. Then they double down on it by telling their third kid caught in the middle to also play favourites with them.

If the other people in your family are fighting about \"robotics vs. Theatre\" then that's on them, not you.  They are choosing to make it a fight, instead of problem-solving ways to handle two events scheduled at the same time.   By blaming you, they are refusing to take responsibility for their own actions - that's their problem, not yours.", "NTA.  I applaud you for doing the right thing.  Your parents and all that shit about her performance is bullshit manipulation.  Her performance is on her.  Sounds selfish on your sisters part to want all the attention on her.

Good for you for showing up for your brother.", "Your parents are ridiculous for saying this is your fault. Your sister and brother are obviously competing for your parents' attention. That's not your fault or your problem. Odds are good that the fight would have happened anyway.\n\nI'm glad you were there to support your brother. Next time you decide to go to his performance and your sister has something going on then too, let her know why you're going to your brother's thing. Make sure she knows that you love and support her but that he needs the encouragement of at least one family member too. I hope that helps.", "They should not be putting that on you, or making ridiculous claims like your decision to support your brother, specifically because he had no support impacted your sister's performance. Even if true, it's not your responsibility. She had the support of her parents, I think it's completely fair to have at least one person supporting the other sibling. Either way, it should've been your choice, and they should've understood your reason.", "OP, you seem like the grown-up in that family.  I am happy that you supported your brother in his main interest.. the sister needs to get over herself... she's had plenty of time in the spotlight in the souless eyes of her (y'alls) parents..  sorry your parents suck. Good luck to you and your brother", "You should be praised for being an empathetic and kind brother, wise as well to see what everyone else is ignoring. It\u2019s hard to stand alone and have a dissenting view, but you are have just as much right as anyone else in your family to hold your perspective. I hope you see this as an important stand you took for not only your brother, but for yourself. Id suggest not arguing with your parents and sister and instead let them know you see it from a different perspective and firmly believe your all of you deserve support irregardless of how well you perform or how much or little others share interests in your pursuits. Good for you and hope your parents and sister get a clue and see how insensitive their actions have been.", "NTA. It makes me terribly sad when favoritism plays out so openly", "NTA.  This is 100% on your parents.  It's really simple.  It's called \"divide and conquer\".  That's what you do when your kids have things that compete with one another and are scheduled at the same time.  One parent goes to one event, the other parent goes to the other. My husband and I would then switch the next time so that it wasn't the same parent going to the same kids events.  You as the sibling can choose where to be and maybe be mindful that the next time you go to the other sibling's event.  Can this be exhausting sometimes? Yes.  So is parenting in general.  Your parents are playing favorites. Some day your brother will be NC and your parents will wonder why.  You can point to this as a perfect example.", "Your parents are assholes for acting like it's your fault. You were just trying to spread out the love a little more evenly. That's a good thing. I don't really understand why your parents and sisters are acting like it was the obvious thing you'd attend the robotics competition. Sounds like there's a lack of empathy toward your brother and a whole lot of favoritism going on. And it's definitely not a 15-year-old's job to fix this messed up family dynamic. I'm sorry you're being scapegoated :(", "NTA, your parents clearly are. You did the right thing and I'm sorry you were put in the middle of this situation and I feel very bad for your brother, his passion matters a lot for him and your parents should show some support.", "NTA your parents are more to blame for the issue than anyone. Both siblings should be supported. They are causing a divide. I think it is super sweet you were there for your bother and your sister should not begrudge you supporting another sibling.", "NTA.  Your sister and brother both deserved to be supported for their events.  You found the best solution.  Both of them had support.  Yes, both of them would have liked to have everyone but sometimes its better to split than to leave one person without.  That being said, we know who the golden child is and so does she.  She feels entitled to the limelight.", "Plus, if the sisters performance bases itself on whether their 15 year old sibling is there the 18 year old needs to grow up and realise she isn't the center of the world", "So there are two parents and there were two events to attend --- you'd think the parents would be better at math, considering how much they care about STEM subjects.", "Yeah. Op parents are awful. I feel bad for the brother. I can imagine how he felt. I would have done the same as op and rip them a new one. I think op should have a talk with sister and parents about how they are making the brother feel", "No, because theater is not good enough for them. Even if the sister didn't have a conflicting event they still probably wouldn't have gone to their son's performance. \n\nNTA Op. Wait until your whole family is together, tell them you have something really important you'd like to discuss, then ask them why they love your sister but not your brother, why after you decided since the whole family was going to support the sister yet AGAIN that when you went in support of your brother they said what they said to you and put all the blame on you for everyone else's feelings, and then ask them why they are telling you that your sister is more important than your brother and demanding you \"support\" her over your brother.

I was in MANY MANY MANY performances in school. I loved theater, loved being around my theater friends. Loved learning lines, seeing the costumes, the sets. The cute boys I had crushes on. But none of that paved the way for college. And unless this is fake, brother would have had more than one performance OP could have gone to. He could have chosen to support both his sister and brother. Sounds like OP just likes brother more. ESH except the 18 year olds.", "more to the ;point this wass one of may events for sister. it was the ONE thing the brother had an mom and dad said by their actions he didn't matter.\n\nit is all on them and trying to guilt their daughter /op for their poor p\\[arenting is disgusting", "Thank you.  I was looking for a reply that addressed that.  There\u2019s a lot of bullshit above it, too,  it that line still stood out to me.  Turning this around to blame on OP, like there wouldn\u2019t have been a conflict if OP had just gone to the sister\u2019s competition, is awful.\n\nI guess they think the brother would have gotten their message loud and clear and given up if OP hadn\u2019t supported him.  Or maybe that he would have agreed that the sister\u2019s event was obviously more important if OP hadn\u2019t acted otherwise.  They\u2019re cruel and delusional.", "NTA. Yeah, I had to read it again and I wash shocked. SHOCKED, he was the youngest child! Why are they fighting over a 15yo's approval? I thought at first he was an older sibling who lived out of the home.\n\nThis is awful, the brother is obviously denigrated because he doesn't stand out academically, but this isn't healthy for the sister either. I know some people here are calling her a golden child but I feel kinda bad for her, she's also getting the not so subtle message that she's only valued for her achievements, so obviously it stings when someone doesn't show up when her events are so 'important', because it's about getting into a good college and getting a great score or grade, but it's not about her as a person and that's kinda sad. She's gonna be in for a rude awakening in adulthood once she sees that potential friends, dates, and even employers aren't all going to care about if she was in chess club or debate club, or what her SAT scores were.\n\nOP did absolutely the right thing showing up for his big brother. It wasn't a slight against the other sibling. People deserve support even if it's for casual interests or hobbies. Any *sane* family would have split up to support both kids, this family has so many issues the youngest child happens to have the most emotional intelligence.", "Yeah that was my first thought\u2014 that they wanted someone to blame for her poor performance.\n\nNTA!", "Go on?", "Ironically, I'm looking into robotics engineering, and we don't get paid all that much.", "[removed]", "Exactly! We have to support children in what they want to do and sometimes we (parents) kind of need to butt out and let children find their own way. I have a stepson who is not really a sports guy (well he is 8 so not really a guy yet), but he loves to build. So he joined a scouting and gets to build stuff. If we would have pushed for a sport like soccer or hockey (big sports in our country) he would have been miserable every single time. So we don\u2019t. We want him to do stuff he likes and not the stuff we like. We also introduce him to the stuff we like ofcourse, because he might like them as well but if he doesn\u2019t that is more than fine.", "Did you miss the part where OP is 15? He shouldn't have to deal with all that. It sucks that he was put in this position in the first place. It would have sucked even if parents were decent, one went to each event and OP still had to pick. But, this is just terrible.\n\nI hope he continues to be supportive to brother, and sister can come around to see that. I have no hope from the parents at all.\n\nOP is NTA.", "That's so horrifically embarrassing for the brother. And in what world does that end well for OP? It's not like a confrontation like that is going to convince them to change their behavior, he just gets horribly punished and they'd discount any reasonable conversation about family dynamics.\n\nThat's a solution that's really fun for us, as people who know the parents are being despicable but don't suffer any consequences. But it makes everybody actually in the situation  hurt and much worse off.\n\nI just keep thinking that if my sibling got me together in a group of people and told them all that my parents didn't love me to make a dunking point, I'd have a hard time ever speaking to them again. I certainly wouldn't feel supported.", "Yeah, maybe don't ask the parents in front of the whole family why they love the sister and not the brother?  That will not end well.  Worst case is they openly agree and explain why.  Think that will help the brother?", "Sadly, this would likely turn out poorly for the brother since the parents are already quite unashamed about their preferences", "Oh, yes, I love this.
