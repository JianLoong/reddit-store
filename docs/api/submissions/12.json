I bet your great grandmother left it to you because you weren't part of the arguments in front of her and because you had left the country so it would be harder for your relatives to come after you.   \nYou are under no obligation to sell that ring, and quite frankly, it probably would not sell enough to cover the medical expenses. Unfortunately, resell prices are not usually close to purchase or insurance value. If you have some extra money and feel generous, you could chip in what you can afford. Just know that your relationship with these relatives will be permanently damaged, but it sounds like that this won't be a loss for you.", "I N F O: If you did sell the ring, would that even begin to cover the cost of your relative's medical bills, realistically? If the ring had gone to someone else in your family, would they still be pushing for the ring to be sold?\n\nEdit: I see that the cost of the procedure would be around $27,000. Your family has a lot of high, unrealistic hopes for that ring. Even if it's actually worth that much money, it's not necessarily going to be a breeze finding a buyer for it. If an entire family can't come up with $27,000, what makes them think someone has that much money just lying around burning a hole in their pocket? And further, what makes them think that very wealthy individual will be right there to scoop up that ring as soon as you list it for sale?\n\nThe pressure your family is putting on you honestly feels a bit spiteful to me. The black sheep of the family inherited the most coveted item, and now they're insisting you must part with it. So, tell me, what items are your relatives selling of their own in order to raise this money? Who else is contributing to this expense? Why does it fall solely on you?\n\nNTA.", "NTA and it's unlikely the ring would manage to cover all the medical treatment expenses anyways if you live in the US just because medical treatment is SO expensive.\n\nDo they already know what it was appraised for? If not, I would just lie and tell them a professional appraiser said it wasn't worth as much as thought. Or \u2014 honestly you don't have to defend yourself to these people. They sound awful and cruel.", "NTA. There are plenty of other ways to raise money.

I doubt any of them would have sold it to pay for said family member's medical bills", "Why Grandma left the ring to you is obvious: everyone else cared more about getting the ring than about grandma. Also, they never treated you right, so why do they expect you to fork out money now? NTA.\n\nInfo: the person who is actually ill, was he/she nice to you or rude?", "NTA.  It would be very interesting to see what one of the other family members would do if they had the ring ... would they sell it?  Easy to say \"sell it\" when it doesn't impact them.\n\nWhy don't they all contribute some cash for this person instead?", "NTA\n\nWould they have done the same thing? Is that why they were fighting for it?\n\nPlus, even if it is valued at a lot, that doesn\u2019t mean you have a buyer ready to pay said price.", "NTA - It sounds like your relatives don't treat you like family, but a cash cow. The ring was left to YOU for a reason - possibly as her last word about their behavior.\n\nThis is the age if GoFundMe. They have an alternative. Let them use it.", "NTA. They say you\u2019re not \u201cpart of the family\u201d yet expect you to take on the family\u2019s financial burdens. Why isn\u2019t everyone else in the extended family contributing towards this person\u2019s medical care or starting a go fund me or working to get her on their insurance? Sounds like a situation of \u201cif I can\u2019t have the ring, then no one can.\u201d", "NTA.  The people demanding that you pay for her expenses should be doing that themselves, and I might ask them if they've sold their cars, mortgaged their homes, or dipped into their savings or retirement accounts to pay for her treatment.  I might also point out that they're the ones who didn't treat you like family or even with basic human decency and only now expect you to do the opposite.  Um, no.", "NTA it's still a power play over the ring not so much about the person dying.  If they can't have that stupid ring no one.  They are fixated on this thing.  I'd get it praised by a professional jewerly shop.  Unless it's sometype of antique usually rings go down in value not save value or increase value.  They could all be fighting over absolutley nothing.", "NTA, calling you a murderer is fucked, these seem like horrible people and ggma gave you the ring for this reason", "NTA. However you might want to get the ring appraised to sell (as opposed to for insurance) for your own benefit.\n\nFor many families, the heirloom in question might be worth $900 or something.\n\nCertainly high sentimental value but rarely incredible actual monetary value. The resale value on diamonds is usually surprisingly low.", "NTA. This family speaks horribly about you and to you and they still are even when asking for a huge gift.

No need to answer because it\u2019s irrelevant.", "NTA\n\nWhy even bother with those people who don't even consider you family. Yet another reason why the US needs universal health care, assuming that's where you and and your family are from. \n\nBut you are NTA. From what I gather you rarely see or speak to these people and they don't even like you and yet they have the gaul to demand YOUR ring? Who do they think they are? Sauron?!\n\nTo hell with them.", "NTA. It isn't your responsibility to take care of people who are essentially strangers. Especially by selling YOUR property. And i'm going to go on a limb and say that the money from the sale of the ring wont be significant enough to cover any sort of life saving treatment, which often goes into the hundreds of thousands.", "NTA. Your grandma knew the family were fighting over it\u2026they did it front of her.    She likely knew they were only interested in it\u2019s possible intrinsic value.  She gave it to you pointedly and purposefully, quite possibly because she knew you WOULDN\u2019T sell it.   \n\nShe must have known of this relative\u2019s illness right? She could have left it to them, or sold it in her lifetime for any reason, and given them or anyone money from it.\n\nShe wants the ring to remain in the family, and entrusted it with you.", "NTA.\n\nYour great great grandmother gave you the ring, specifically.  It is yours to do with as you will.\n\nThat said, if you can afford in any way to assist your family member that has a serious illness, please do so as you are able, and feel free to tell your nosey family that you are doing that.", "NTA. Family heirlooms like that do have a general price in society (obviously because someone would always buy it), but are priceless in the grand scheme of things for your family. I\u2019m sure the future generations of your family will appreciate that you held your ground and did not sell it. \n\nAlso, your other family member\u2019s health is not your or your great great grandmother\u2019s direct responsibility. If they need money that badly, they can start a fundraiser - to me it seems like they just want to control what happens to the ring and are using the sick family member as an excuse. \n\nAnyways, none of this matters because it is your ring now and you can do whatever you fit!", "NTA The ring was left to you. It's not up to anyone else in the family to tell you what to do with it.", "NTA  Your family is angry that you inherited the ring and so their response is to guilt trip you into selling a family heirloom and giving them the money, that will not be anywhere near enough to pay for catastrophic medical expenses, just so that you don't get to keep great grandma's ring.  They are so petty.", "INFO: Will it really cover the expenses? Did anyone give money to the person with the illness?\n\n  \nNTA, it looks like they're solely depending on that ring to cover the expenses. I think they should just gang up and raise the money instead of saying bad things about you. So, keep that ring with you.", "NTA If they need the money they will have plenty of other ways of doing so.", "INFO: is the engagement ring your Great Great Grandma left you the ONLY heirloom in the family? Seriously, is that the only thing they could think of selling? Is the ring also more valuable than anything else?", "INFO: Is that ring the last resort for financial support? Do your family not have any other alternatives?\n\nEDIT: It seems like OP's family is just putting so much pressure to a certain family member just because of a valuable inheritance. NTA.", "They said you weren't *really* family. So how is this your problem? NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd with the medical costs the way it is, unless that ring is incredibly huge, I don\u2019t know of any ring that would possibly cover a medical bill that high. Clearly they exist, but most rings handed down aren\u2019t worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.", "NTA \n\nIt is your ring to do with as you please. \n\nThey mistreat you, yet expect you to use your inheritance to give them money? It will not be a loan. You will be wasting your inheritance on people who despise you. They can set up payment plan, or fundraisers to pay for treatment.\n\nThere is a compromise though. You will sell the ring after they have sold all their gaming systems, their cars, their homes, all toys, get rid of streaming services, and sell all but 7 days worth of clothes. Essentially they have to get rid of their possessions first.", "NTA, First of all there is no guarantee selling the ring would raise enough to pay for treatment. Also, how much effort has gone into other methods of raising money? How likely is treatment to succeed?  There a wide difference between \"easy source of cash\" and \"last resort\"\n\nSecond, it has been made clear to you that you aren't family, why should you give up heirlooms to help them? It's quite hypocritical to simulation judge you for taking things you don't deserve because your not family while expecting you to act like you are\n\nThird, calling you a murderer is utterly ridiculous. You are neither the cause for her condition, nor is her care and recovery your responsibility. While helping would be the kind thing to do, you bear no moral burden if you choose not to do so", "NTA\n\nThey said you are not really family, so how does being family suddenly matter?\n\nSeems like your gggMother knew exactly what she did, when she didn't feed the ring to the sharks.", "NTA what they probably don't realize is grandma left the ring to you because everyone else was fighting over it like a bunch of crazy people.  Grandma saw that and thought screw it. None of these greedy ingrates will get it and it went to you.\n\nThis isn't remotely about medical bills, this is a guilt trip and power play over the ring.  You have no legal or even moral obligation to help these people.  They may be *family* but in reality rhy are practically strangers and strangers who are treating you like crap and behaving quite badly.  Keep the ring, Blick everyone who is being an ass, and live your life", "She left it to you for a reason, and the rest seem to treat you like shit. No, your not. Maybe if they were never and made you feel like you belonged, thr way your gma did, maybe then", "No. If they\u2019re so close they can sell their assets to heal her. Why should you sell what\u2019s yours? Jewelry that\u2019s second hand is rarely highly valuable anyway.

Not to pay someone else's medical bills", "NTA\n\nThey wouldn't have sold the ring to save the family member, or else they all would have agreed to sell it for that.", "If you're not part of the family in their eyes even though you're blood, than why would they expect a non family member to give them a bunch of money?", "NTA - I don\u2019t see you as owning these people anything. You were picked for this inheritance for a reason", "Why don't they all just pitch in.\nWhy is the sole responsibility for the costs suddenly on you?\nThey don't even like you and will likely not like you even if you did sell the ring.\nSuggest they sell their stuff to cover the bill if they are feeling so generous with other people's stuff.\nBlegh, NTA.", "NTA. I mean from the story I think we know why the ring was left to you and not them. Are you 100% sure she needs the treatment and it\u2019s not all a ruse to get the ring from you? Because by the sounds of these people aren\u2019t below doing that. If I was you, I\u2019d cut contact with everyone of them. If she truly needs life saving treatment, let the rest of them pool their resources and sell things to raise the money, this isn\u2019t on you", "NTA - Don\u2019t you dare sell it. They have made it clear how they feel about you and ONLY are asking you because they know you got the shiny prize they wanted and fought over.  I would put money on it that you got the ring because you weren\u2019t arguing over it and asking for it. Let me be clear: if you didn\u2019t get this ring, no one in the \u201cfamily\u201d would be bugging you for any money at all. They are only asking you because they know you have it and don\u2019t think it should have been yours. \nHowever: \u201cNot really part of the family\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t family in the sense that it was left to you as a family member. Family doesn\u2019t just mean those who live close. Families move, immigrate, take jobs in other cities or live close to their significant other\u2019s family. Sometimes those people don\u2019t actually act like family. Your blood makes you family and that\u2019s why you got the ring from someone who wanted to make sure you were included and seen as family in their eyes. Don\u2019t negate that sentiment. Keep that ring and make sure you don\u2019t let it go. That means more that you were included and that your GGgrandma saw YOU as HER family. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA! Don't sell that ring. They can make a go found me or what it's called. That ring was left to you, I guess because she didn't want it to be sold and the only one that she knew wouldn't sell it was you.", "NTA - I assume you were given the ring because you wouldn\u2019t sell it. Keep being you.\n\nEdit to say that my mother promised my grandma on her deathbed that she wouldn\u2019t sell her house. She did and this has haunted her ever since. Hope this helps.", "NTA - also it\u2019s unlikely you would get more than $200 for a used ring no matter how \u201cexpensive\u201d it is. My sister was a jeweler for 20 years and she worked with the only goldsmith in our town who would frequently buy jewelry from people. They didnt purchase jewelry for high dollar value. Even most pawn shops will only pay less than half the value. These people are delusional if they think that selling the ring will solve anything. It wouldn\u2019t. Enjoy the ring. After all, according to these people you aren\u2019t even family and don\u2019t owe them anything.", "NTA.\nIf everyone was so eager to do right by the relative who is I'll, they should've asked your GGGM for permission to sell the ring as to pay for the treatment, irrespective of whomever got the ring.\nBut as they did it, they only seem to want to take the ring away from you as they didn't got it. If they thought the ring should be sold to pay for the treatment irrespective of whomever got the ring, they wouldn't have fought over the ring.", "NTA. i doubt the ring is gonna cover even half of the medical expenses", "NTA - block those \u201cfamily\u201d members. You don\u2019t need that level of negativity", "NTA. The ring was left to you, and they gave you a lot of crap about it. Now those same people want to turn around and beg for you to sell it and give them the money? That\u2019s probably why the ring was left to you in the first place. \nChances are good that it is not actually worth what they think it is. Wouldn\u2019t it be funny if you had it appraised and it turned out to be a paste duplicate because granny and gramps actually sold the real one for cash flow and never told anyone? Then left it you because you are the only one that wouldn\u2019t try to sell it and thus nobody would ever know?", "NTA. Keep your ring. Jewelry is rarely worth as much as people think anyway. It's a nice family heirloom and should stay in the family. Clearly, your g-g-grandmother viewed you as family, whatever the rest of these people say. Enjoy the ring for the next forty or fifty years and then give it to a daughter or granddaughter.", "NTA.  I suspect your ggm knew exactly what she was doing when she left the ring to you.  You should ask your relatives if they would be badgering her to sell the ring to pay for the medical treatment if she were still alive.   I feel bad for your sick relative, but your family is butt hurt that you inherited the ring and they are bullying you.", "She probably knew the others would just sell it, I'd say your not really apart of my family so go suck a melon, why would I give something so valuable witch is now rightfully mine to someone I'm not 'properly' related to lol", "NTA.\n\nMultiple members of this family told you that you don't deserve the ring because they don't see you as family. So there's your answer.\n\nYou don't owe medical treatment to someone who's not your family, not your friend, and with whom you don't even have a good relationship. They can go ask some other virtual stranger for money, or better yet, people who actually care about them.\n\nKeep the ring. Cherish that you got it, because you're great-great-grandmother saw you as family, and probably appreciated that you weren't stabbing your family members in the back to get it. You never saw yourself entitled to the ring, and maybe that's why you got it. If she had thought any of these other vultures were entitled to it, she would have left it to them.", "NTA.\n\n Maybe gggma left you the ring because by not being there you couldn't possibly bicker in front of her", "NTA - it would be fair that everyone pays for her treatment but they expect you to cover it because they still think the ring shouldn\u2019t be yours. Ask them all what they will give for treatment and spend the same amount.
