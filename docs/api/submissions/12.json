They are his kids and if they want to make a cake just for him then who cares unless the gf was trying to do a power move. Then it\u2019s the fact that your kids should learn to give gifts that the birthday person actually wants. The gf could have been trying to relay a comment from your ex that he didn\u2019t want another cake from the kids this year or have been looking out for his interest in some way. We also don\u2019t have the gf or ex\u2019s perspectives on how you went about this and other situations, which could be a reason why she acted that way.\n\nUltimately, I think you should discuss these matters with your ex and limit or cut off contact with the gf to prevent further situations between you two and future escalations. Unless you are able to have a good relationship with each other outside of this. It really depends on how your ex feels about this, but I\u2019m going to say NTA because I can\u2019t imagine him having a big issue receiving a personal cake on his birthday from his kids. But talk to him about it for him to handle things with his gf and see if he cared about receiving 2 cakes. I think he is the best judge of whether or not you were the AH in this situation.", "I think this is likely more of a \"how this was communicated\" issue more than you or the other person being jerks.", "NTA,\nIt\u2019s just a cake.\nBut, Your children knowing that their parents are on good terms despite a divorce is more important than his new gfs feelings about her store bought cake. I think your willingness to let her know you were still doing it and offering to bring it at a different time shows it\u2019s not about upstaging her and it\u2019s really for the kids.", "INFO: Have you been saying that YOU are making the cake or that the cake is coming from the kids / the kids made their dad a cake? \n\nI would say that in this case, it matters how this has been communicated specifically.", "INFO: How old are the kids, specifically the daughter who was asking about Dad's cake?", "INFO: What is the opinion of your ex on this?

The girlfriend is asserting her dominance. Any woman who says her boyfriend can\u2019t have a cake from his kids needs to think long and hard about being with someone with kids. Freaking out over a small cake from the kids \u201cruining\u201d a party is ridiculous. She is very insecure.

So you're an \"amateur baker\" and you like ***getting attention by*** making cakes for people for their birthdays.  Not looking good.\n\n>My ex doesn\u2019t like sweet stuff but our kids like helping me make a cake for him so I normally make one for him anyway for their sakes.\n\nOk, that's kinda sweet.  I guess the cake is for them to enjoy since he doesn't like cake.  Any excuse to eat cake, right?\n\n>This year his girlfriend planned a party for him and she told me she had already ordered him a cake so I didn\u2019t need to make one.\n\n Alright, so no cake (that he doesn't want anyway) this year.\n\n>I told her that was fine but my daughter kept asking me when we would make her dad\u2019s cake and was upset when I said we wouldn\u2019t because she assumed I didn\u2019t like my ex and that\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t make him one.\n\nThat's quite a leap your daughter took.  You won't bake him a cake, even though he doesn't like/eat cake, therefore you hate him?  I'm guessing this isn't about the cake then.\n\n>Since  the cake has always been more for the kids than for my ex, I decided to just make him a small one since it\u2019s not like he eats cake anyway and I don\u2019t want my kids to think I dislike their dad. \n\nOk, and they can eat it at home without him, since he doesn't like cake right?\n\n>I told his girlfriend beforehand that I was going to make a small cake and she told me not to and that I couldn\u2019t bring it to the party. **I told her I had to bring it to the party** as that\u2019s when the kids would give him his gifts. I offered to come early and give it to him before the other guests arrived and then they could put it away and nobody else would know about my cake but she didn\u2019t agree with me and repeatedly told me not to bring it.\n\nShe, the host, repeatedly told you not to bring something she already bought for the party.  Why are you pushing this, considering your ex won't be eating it anyway?  Also, why did you \"have\" to bring it.\n\nIs this really because, for reasons that have nothing to do with cake, your daughter thinks you hate your ex and this was your only way of proving to her you don't?  I mean there HAD to be other ways than this.\n\n>I did take it with me in the end \n\nAfter you were repeatedly told not to?  YTA.\n\n>and now she keeps complaining to mutual friends that I did it on purpose to ruin the party and calling me weird for making him a cake after I was told not to.\n\nShe's right.  You did do it on purpose, knowing it would cause an issue at the party.  And you are weird for bringing the cake after you were repeatedly told not to.", "OP, you said yourself right in the opening lines that you\u2019re an amateur baker and like baking cakes for people. The breakup from your ex can\u2019t be all that old with kids so little. So I\u2019m calling YTA on this, mostly bc I think this is less about the kids and more about you being petty with your ex\u2019s girlfriend, and you\u2019re hiding behind the kids to boot. I mean, the man doesn\u2019t even like cake. You do. Stop pushing. \n\nThe girlfriend is throwing this party. She\u2019s the host. She gets to run her own party. You asked repeatedly and were told no repeatedly. But you did it anyhow, and that\u2019s rude. \n\nThe kids are apparently very little (under 5), from what you said elsewhere. They only think this is a tradition because you\u2019re telling them it is. Steer them elsewhere. When your daughter says, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we making Daddy a cake?\u201d you say, \u201cYou know, Daddy doesn\u2019t like cake as much as he likes cards. This year what Daddy wants most is a big special card you made for him yourself. He\u2019s so excited to see it, he told me. Let\u2019s get to work!\u201d Bam. You\u2019re done.", "INFO: How old are the children, and how long ago did you and your ex split? Are they old enough to understand that the cake tradition will be different this year?", "The wildest part of this is the birthday boy apparently doesn\u2019t even like cake but both his current woman and ex feel so strongly that he *needs* cakes.\n\nAnd yeah, yeah I know it\u2019s a party with guests and kids who all like cake but it still strikes me as super weird since he is supposedly the guest of honor and there\u2019s like zero considerations for what he actually would like as a dessert", "INFO: How old are the kids and what\u2019s the custody arrangement? Just curious as to when\u2019s the next time the kids would see him and if he ever celebrates special occasions with them separately so the kids can continue having their traditions (like homemade cake) with him?", "INFO - why do you keep crediting yourself when you tell us it\u2019s more for your kids? This would have sounded much better saying \u201cthe kids want to give their father a birthday cake\u201d \n\nInstead you keep emphasizing yourself for making the cake, so it does makes it feel very weird like YOU can\u2019t resist giving your ex a cake\n\nAlso, why did you have to bring the cake, why couldn\u2019t your kids handle it since they wanted to give it to him? And why did it have to be *at* the party she threw?", "INFO: Why didn't you explain to your daughter it wasn't bc you don't like your ex, that someone else who also cares about your ex got him a cake this year? You're basically centering your daughter in an event that's not about her.", "I will go against the flow apparently, but I think YTA.\nPeople can cumunicate, you and the girlfriend should have talked better and come to a mutual ground, where you could have done something else to the kid's dad, and than your kids would get the chance to give the father a gift that maybe he would prefer instead of cake and the girlfriend would not feel attacked. \nI think YTA, but I think the girlfriend was the AH too. \nI confess that I don't agree with parents that indolge every Winn of their children and I think tou were trying to assert your dominance too by what you did. \nJust my opinion", "YTA \n\nOffering to come way before the party is not the compromise you and other people seem to think it is lol If I'm finishing getting ready for an event and three kids show up early with their mother, that is only going to cause chaos and slow things down. Not to mention, those same children are likely to wonder why no one is eating their cake when the GF brings hers out, which would likely result in the cake being brought out during the party anyway.\n\nAlso, they are young enough that they don't have a real sense of tradition yet unless OP is referring to it as such. People acting like children aren't easily diverted to fun, new art projects are bizarre. But other art projects don't allow the amateur baker who likes to make cake show off at someone else's event \ud83d\ude44", "YTA.  He doesn't like cake.  Why did a cake become a tradition for you in the first place when he doesn't like it?  Sorry but the attitude that you show here is a good indicator of why he's an *ex*, and the fact his current gf seems to share it as well bodes ill for their future.  It's **his** birthday, it's about **him**, why is everyone involved ignoring what he does and doesn't like on it?", "Why dont you cook something that isnt pure sugar with your kids for dad?  I think YTA.  She asked you multiple times.  You could have made anything else w your kids, and brought it or not.  You dont date him anymore.  You can only cook birthday cakes w your kids?", "INFO: why didn't you explain to your daughter that his GF didn't want / need the cake?", "Weird. How old is daughter??? Any normal parent would say \u2018Daddy doesn\u2019t want cake this year but how about we buy him a present he would like\u201d. I think there is a element of trying to force the cake when it\u2019s clearly not wanted or even needed and using daughter as an excuse. YTA", "I'm confused why you are starting a tradition with your kids where they make something for their dad that he doesn't want. His birthday is about him. If he doesn't like cake he shouldn't get a cake from you or the kids. You are making a cake because it's what YOU like to do for people's birthday.  If you replace cake with any other gift, this is super weird.\n\nYou're kids are young enough that this isn't something set in stone that you have to do. You could very easily encourage them to bake something else or make other presents.  They've done it one or two years at most. Maybe 3 for the 5 year old but that's not a long time or a real tradition yet. They view it that way because you are treating it that way. \n\nYou guys are split up. You are going to have to accept that things change and help your children understand that. If the new gf was doing the cake you should have respected that and helped your kids to see that change as positive.  \n\nYTA, don't use your kids as an excuse to stir up trouble.", "Yta. Stop overstepping", ">my daughter kept asking me when we would make her dad\u2019s cake and was upset \n\nYTA \nMaybe you could have had a separate party for your daughter and her father. Maybe you could have made a cake just for your daughter. If the current girlfriend and party planner said not to make one you shouldn't have made one", "YTA. Stop using your kids as an excuse.", "YTA. Why do it? There was cake and you decided to start drama by bringing cake.", "Unpopular opinion ig, YTA. \n\n> I decided to just make him a small one since it\u2019s not like he eats cake anyway\n\nCould just not make him a cake then.\n\n>I don\u2019t want my kids to think I dislike their dad\n\nThen just tell them \"its not that i dont like your dad. He has a cake already, we could make -insert random not sweet dessert- instead.\" Like yeah they are children but they should be able to understand that. \n\nMain reason YTA in my opinion is because the man doesnt even like cake but y'all forcing 2 upon him. As someone who also hates cake, i feel so bad for him.", "YTA, I think it's rude to bring a cake to someone else's party especially knowing his new lady had ordered one. You could have given your cake on a different day. I'm sure this could have been easily explained to a 4 year old unless it's the 4 year old running your house.", "YTA this had nothing to do with your kids and everything with your need for attention. Using your kids as an excuse is lame.", "YTA, she's the host and she told you no. Maybe teach your kids about boundaries instead of bulldozing hers.", "I'm going against the grain to say YTA. You don't seem to understand that the role of baking a birthday cake for your ex (that he doesn't even want) does not fall to you anymore. You're crossing boundaries. You're not the wife or girlfriend. You don't seem to communicate well with your children if you can't simply explain that someone else is providing the cake this year. If they desperately want to eat cake, make it some other time of the year. Or they can bake the birthday cake with dad (the cake he doesn't even want).\n\nWhatever you'rye feelings are toward this girlfriend, it seems you're being disrespectful. I'd even say you're doing it on purpose to make her look like she can't coordinate the party well. This whole thing is ridiculous on your part. Your kids are so young you can barely call this a tradition. Even so, go make new traditions with your children, let dad make his own with them.\n\nYour situation reminds me of a story. I knew a friend when we were kids whose parents were divorced & her mom remarried. The new husband damn nearly had the ex-wife coming over for Christmas morning present opening and my friend's mom had to explain \"no the fuck we're not having your ex-wife here at 8am Christmas morning to celebrate with us.\" \"But traditions...\" They said. Too bad, you decided to split & make a new family situation, you don't get to do the same traditions anymore. This story reminds me of you and the sheer cluelessness.", "INFO: Was your ex fine with this? \n\nThat\u2019s all that matters.", "Wow. The judgement is literally split. I'm not sure which to go with.  The kids are 5 and under, so definitely not where they would understand.  All the cake talk should have been between you and ex. The kids could have made it the day before or the day after the party. Honestly, I think it was on your EX to find the solution, not you.", "INFO: Let's see this cake. It will be very obvious whether you helped your 4-year-old make a cake for her dad or *you* made a cake and used your kid as an excuse.", "**YTA**\n\nThis wasn't even about the cake. You literally admit that when your daughter asked when you were going to make it, she \"was upset when I said we wouldn\u2019t because she assumed I didn\u2019t like my ex and that\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t make him one.\" In fact, you note repeatedly that your ex doesn't even LIKE cake. So this whole thing was just about reassuring your child that not making him a cake wasn't a sign of enmity towards him. \n\nYour kid didn't care about cake - she was already giving him other things - she cared about your relationship with her dad, and that you don't suddenly hate him.\n\nSo now I'm just confused. Are you incapable of having a conversation with your child? Of saying the words: \"Nope, not at all. But you know, Daddy doesn't even really eat cake! Have you ever noticed that he doesn't really eat sweets? And \\[girlfriend\\] ordered him a beautiful fancy cake from a bakery for his party (bonus points for being magnanimous and supportive as the ex), and you're going to get to have some of that too!! So we don't need to bake him one this year because there's already going to be a wonderful cake. But should we make him something else? You could design a card for him, or if you want to bake we could make him some cookies...\"\n\nThere is literally NO REASON, unless someone either literally cut out your tongue, or you just don't like speaking to your own children, that this had to go this way. Use your words. Explain to your children that there's already going to be a cake at the party, \"So let's do something different\". YOU WERE ASKED TO RESPECT A BOUNDARY, and it wasn't an inappropriate or ridiculous one, because you understand as an adult that it's not the cake that your kids were worried about, it's making daddy happy. SO TELL THEM THAT THEY DON'T NEED A CAKE TO MAKE HIM HAPPY. \n\nYou're the grownup here. Instead of teaching your children to treat their dad's partner as if she's an annoyance, maybe teach them to be gracious and collaborative. YTA.", "YTA - there were so many moments that you could have prevented this by using good communication.

This was a thing that your children did for their father, who they love. It sounds like you are supporting your children\u2019s love for their father and trying to show the kids that mom and dad are ok/no hard feelings (even if there are hard feelings, it\u2019s the parents job to protect the kids from seeing them), even though you aren\u2019t together anymore. That\u2019s what healthy co-parenting looks like. \n\nIt kind of sounds like the new partner is feeling threatened by you giving your ex a cake, which is bizarre because your kids are the ones making it (with your help and supervision, but still\u2026) for their father. She needs to get a grip on the kids relationship with their father coming before her - she may not be a permanent fixture in their lives, but you and the father are. It\u2019s not like you are going out and dropping $500 on some over the top, excessive, professionally made cake in order to \u201cone up\u201d her.  It\u2019s a homemade cake that, while I\u2019m sure is made with lots of love, likely wasn\u2019t the prettiest thing in the world. It\u2019s a cake made specifically for their father, not everyone else. If this continues to be a problem, it\u2019s going to fall on your ex to talk with her/put her in her place - she doesn\u2019t get to dictate how his children interact with him, especially over something they made to show him that they love him and want to celebrate him. Her feelings on the situation aren\u2019t your responsibility and, frankly, after the conversation you\u2019ve already had with her (telling her it\u2019s from the kids, offering to drop it off earlier so others don\u2019t see it, etc.), I\u2019d either tell her that you are done talking with her about the situation and/or discuss it with her in front of your ex (to avoid your words getting twisted into something else) so he is aware of the hard feelings she is having over his children giving him cake on his birthday. If, at the end of that discussion, your ex decides that he wants to no longer get cake from your kids, he can tell them himself so you aren\u2019t the bad guy and give them other suggestions on what they could make instead. \n\nI\u2019m also seeing a lot of complaints about the ex not even liking cake - I get the current girlfriend being an AH over getting him something he doesn\u2019t even like, but OP\u2019s children are making their father a cake. Most kids associate birthdays with cake - there is a really good chance that this is what they have their hearts set on making to celebrate their father. Anyone who has kids knows that your children will gift you with something that you have no interest in/is gross/inedible, but you thank them for it, tell them you love it, and let them be excited that they were able to give you something - there is no need to crush a little kids spirit by telling them that they hate the type of thing they made for them. I\u2019m sure that will change as the kids get older and realize that cake isn\u2019t what their father wants on his birthday, but until that time the ex is going to get cake \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it would\u2019ve been more weird to me if OP refused to make the item their children wanted to make for her ex/their father and made a particular dessert or savory item that she knew her ex would love, but her kids didn\u2019t want to make for him.", "ESH. You probably should've just told the kids that you won't make a cake since he already has one, but that you could get your ex a small friendly gift that the kids help you pick. Plus, the girlfriend did say no multiple times anyway, and you did cross that boundary of hers. I have mixed opinions on that boundary, but I could picture the girlfriend being nervous about being one-upped/the ex loving it too much? I think leaving the girlfriend out of it entirely and just calling your ex to go \"Hey, the kids wanted to know if you wanted a cake for your birthday?\", and letting him say no. Then asking for hints for a gift, then gifting it with your kids lol.\n\nThe girlfriend, I get why she'd be annoyed at the idea of an ex bringing a cake, but even so, you did offer to just bring it aside from peering eyes and nosy party guests who might assume something is up. I'd just say the kids made it/actually have had the kids help make it and dropped it off.

If the girlfriend doesn't want to date a dad, she shouldn't date a dad. There will always be family traditions that are important to keep for the children's sake, and a mature person would ask to be a part of those traditions instead of throwing a fit that he had a life before she came along. If she has a problem with that, she should take that up with him and then he can tell his children that he no longer wants to participate in those traditions.", "NTA. Why can\u2019t the gf wrap her head around the fact that it is something his kids take joy in?

My ex doesn\u2019t like sweet stuff but our kids like helping me make a cake for him so I normally make one for him anyway for their sakes. \n\nThis year his girlfriend planned a party for him and she told me she had already ordered him a cake so I didn\u2019t need to make one. I told her that was fine but my daughter kept asking me when we would make her dad\u2019s cake and was upset when I said we wouldn\u2019t because she assumed I didn\u2019t like my ex and that\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t make him one.\n\nSince the cake has always been more for the kids than for my ex, I decided to just make him a small one since it\u2019s not like he eats cake anyway and I don\u2019t want my kids to think I dislike their dad. I told his girlfriend beforehand that I was going to make a small cake and she told me not to and that I couldn\u2019t bring it to the party. I told her I had to bring it to the party as that\u2019s when the kids would give him his gifts. I offered to come early and give it to him before the other guests arrived and then they could put it away and nobody else would know about my cake but she didn\u2019t agree with me and repeatedly told me not to bring it.\n\nI did take it with me in the end and now she keeps complaining to mutual friends that I did it on purpose to ruin the party and calling me weird for making him a cake after I was told not to.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Did you tell her they were the only reason you were pushing? Put simply - did ex know this was meant to be the kids\u2019 gift to ex and not a cake from you?\n\nThe wording of your post goes to great lengths to talk about the kids and tradition EXCEPT in your communication to gf. There, you really make it sound like the cake is solely from you? Lot of \u201cmy cake\u201d, etc.. in the wording there.\n\nDid gf know this was a kid baked cake as per tradition for the dad?\n\nAlso - how many years has this been a tradition?", "Right? Like he\u2019s the dad but appears to have no agency.", "He just sits there begging them to please stop bringing him cake.", "Seriously, why is this even on his kids mom to deal with. He needs to give his girlfriend a reality check. Glad he\u2019s an ex.", "I may get down voted, but I have to say: this is an important point. My bf has an ex who bakes a lot. Their daughter often helps (she is now 14, they have been divorced 12 years). His ex and my bf have a contentious relationship. She is ultra conservative and raising her daughter to be a good wife and mother, and my bf wants her to be a smart capable woman who can choose her own path in life.\n\nEx is not invited to family celebrations with bf's family, but she finds a way to insert herself whenever possible. Like by bringing cakes and desserts even though we have everything covered already. She drops by and just walks into the house with cake. This happens even when we have had their daughter for several days, so it is not like she is dropping off the cake with the daughter. I came downstairs one day in my robe and she was just sitting at my table with a cake for the party in 2 hours. Whenever my bf asks her not to this, she says \"(Daughter) wanted me to make this for you! She helped, it's a present!\" But when we talk to the daughter, it turns out Mom told her they were making the cake, and made her help because she needs to learn to bake to get a good husband! \n\nIn addition, ex has cats that wander the counters, and more than once there has been cat hair in the food.\n\nHe has asked her to stop, his parents asked her to stop. Last party we had, I sent her a text that said we had a cake and didn't need one. Guess who showed up with a cake half an hour after the party started? We just sent it back home with his daughter the next day. \n\nSo, while I am not getting these kinds of vibes from the story here, I would want to know what the ex thinks. I am not saying OP is the AH here, but \"The kids wanted to* doesn't mean the ex couldn't redirect the kids to make something else for their dad. \"Daddy doesn't really like cakes, but you know what he loves?

Yes, kid\u2019s feelings are important and should be a priority, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should remove all obstacles.

If OP said \"the kids make their dad a cake every year and they want to do it again this year\" that's different. It's all about how you say it.
