I have always loved traveling and have been traveling solo for a couple of years. My boyfriend had known about my love for traveling since before we got into a relationship, but he\u2019s not too excited about traveling himself. \nWe have been on one vacation together since the start of our relationship because he prefers me not to travel alone. He thought we split everything 50/50, but I actually paid a bit more because I knew that he would feel the accommodation was too expensive. I just love a certain level of luxury and didn\u2019t mind paying for it. \nAfter this, I had a solo weekend trip within Europe to introduce him to the idea and feeling of me traveling alone. \nNow I am planning the next vacation for which I haven\u2019t chosen a destination yet. The only requirement I have is to go outside of Europe. I asked my boyfriend if he would join me, but he doesn\u2019t have the money right now and wants me to wait until the end of the year or maybe next year. I told him that I\u2019d just go by myself this time and go with him once he had the money for it. He\u2019s been seriously mad ever since that conversation, and he thinks that I don\u2019t love him if I choose to go on this trip alone. \nAm I the asshole if I go through with this plan and still go on vacation without him?\n\nEdited to add: I\u2019m very sorry if the story is not clear or if there are lots of mistakes.

I felt that my GF was an asshole about not properly consulting me on her trips, that they were not decisions that we made together as a couple, and she thought i was controlling. I think its though.

In that case I would lean towards you are NTA. You should be able to travel how you like. If he wants to join you, y\u2019all can plan together for when he\u2019d have the money. Until then, enjoy your life as you did before. It is only a bonus if he is able to join.", "Wall of text alert.\n\nThe context is that she used to have a job that involved travelling and i knew that when we got together and i was fine with that it was an occasional 2 day trip on the same continent mostly, then covid happened and those travels stopped and even after covid they were mostly replaced with virtual meetings, then she left said job so become used to her being around all the time.  After this though, she and her group of friends started to return to their normal schedule after covid and started to plan these trips they used to do before covid. The thing is that they started to do that well before we met but as we met right before COVID i did not really had the experience of her leaving. I like to travel but i don't really like to hang out with that group of people as i feel like an outsider and i think she needs a private group of friends so i usually don't go even though i am usually invited.\n\nI was a bit more uncomfortable with those travels due to a slight insecurity i had, the group usually involves single men i don't know.  Now there was one particular trip i was invited and said yes but got sick so i had to cancel the last minute. She still went even though i preferred her to stay at home but my communication was not clear about it. The trip itself is ended up being traumatic for me because we got into an argument online and via the phone while she was there. After she came back i told her that i am not comfortable with her \\*going to the trips\\* anymore and she said that she is sorry but she is still committed to go to these trips in the future.  Now we got into a couple of arguments and ended up not being able to resolve the situation because she insisted on going no compromises, and that made me feel ignored, disrespected and   hurt. In the end after therapy we found the possible reasons of said insecurity and working on eliminating them on the other hand we also learned that making me re-live that trauma won't help solving the issue so what happens now is that i am being asked if i am okay with, as in am i not overly stressed by the specific trip like length, timing, destination, participants etc, to which i usually respond with the truth that now i am, but in a couple of cases i raise concerns and we find a compromise, like when she cancelled one of the trips that i found extensively long, or didn't attend a conference her ex were also attending. She is also going out of her way to plan her trips to dates i have something exiting to do which is also nice.  I am feeling that she is more considerate now which helps \\*me being more supportive.", "Yes, i meant an in depth, non-dismissive conversation .", "You sound controlling and frankly like you\u2019re stifling your girlfriend.", "The similarities are very interesting! Even tough I had told him about my passion of traveling, he didn\u2019t know what it actually would be like because COVID slowed everything down. Now that there are no more restrictions and it\u2019s becoming reality it\u2019s something to get used to. \n\nI am happy to hear that you and your partner found ways to make it work where you are both comfortable! Wish you both may more years and trips \ud83d\ude0a", "Thank you for your input. Honestly appreciated."]}
