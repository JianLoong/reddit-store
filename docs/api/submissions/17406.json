Jessica is married to Chris (40m), who has two kids; Addie (7f) and Luke (10m). Claire spends one week at my place, one week with her mom. Sunday is the \u2018swap day\u2019. \n\nTwo weeks ago, Claire had a huge fight with her stepsiblings. Apparently they snuck into her room when she was away and went through her stuff, breaking some of her important items in the process, and Claire screamed at them when she found out. Jessica and Chris wrote off Addie and Luke\u2019s behavior as \u201ckids will be kids\u201d (I disagree, I think that Addie and Luke need a reality check for their behavior and that they shouldn\u2019t get away with it). However, they said that Claire\u2019s reaction was \u201cover the top\u201d and \u201ca sign that there\u2019s something wrong with her\u201d. \n\nJessica decided that she needed to \u201cfind out what\u2019s in Claire\u2019s head\u201d and so she confiscated Claire\u2019s sketchbook (which Claire uses to get her feelings out) and went through it. Apparently, what she found was \u201cdisturbing\u201d (Claire has showed me her sketchbook before and no it isn\u2019t) and took Claire to a psychologist for evaluation. \n\nSpoiler alert: they didn\u2019t find anything. My daughter is completely mentally healthy, save for (surprise surprise) stress from her step-siblings. \n\nAnyway, I got Claire last Sunday, and she spent her first few hours with me holed up in her room (sketching I think). At dinner, she told me what happened, and I surprised her with pancake breakfast the next morning to make her feel better. \n\nBefore I gave her back to Jessica, Claire asked me to keep her sketchbook at my house so her mom wouldn\u2019t look through it. I said yes, and she went over to her mom\u2019s place without it. \n\nYesterday, I got a text from Jessica. She said that she was \u201cworried that Claire forgot her sketchbook\u201d because when she went to confiscate it, it wasn\u2019t where Claire usually keeps it. She then asked me to arrange a time and place for her to pick it up. I said that the sketchbook was with me, and that I decided to keep it because I didn\u2019t want it confiscated again (I didn\u2019t want to throw Claire under the bus here, in hindsight lying probably wasn\u2019t the best idea). She said that I was being an AH because she \u201chas a right to her daughter\u2019s mind\u201d. I said that i was worried because of how she handled it last time she went through it. She restated her previous point, and I did not respond. \n\nIt\u2019s been about a day since that conversation, and I\u2019m starting to question my choice.

OP, Claire needs more support than should just fall on you, and she needs a safe, neutral third party to discuss this all with.

Otherwise, it'll only get worse and worse. Changing the arrangement won't make Claire's stress fully go away since her parents aren't together and all kids want their parents to be together forever, but at least she will have some sense of stability. You could talk to Claire about it to see how she feels and see what would make her the most comfortable. It's always good to check in with kids on these types of things because their experience/perspective is very real and valid, especially if this swapping thing has been going on for a long time. I'm sure with how Jessica is, it will be tough to get her to agree to this change if that's what Claire wants to do, so it should be made clear to her that it is Claire's decision and not yours.

I agree, go for full custody.", "Right?!\nI feel so bad for this girl- those sketches are basically her diary and her mom went through it- thinks she has the RIGHT to go through it (has the right to her daughters Mind? Wtf does that even mean?).\n\nDocument everything- talk to your daughter see how she feels there. I couldn\u2019t imagine her feeling safe there. Talk to your daughter and find out what she wants *this is very important- I know people are gonna be saying you should push for more custody- and you 100% should- but make sure she\u2019s included* clearly with her mom she doesn\u2019t get this and she deserves to feel safe and feel\nHeard.\n\nIt\u2019s clear she trusts you as she in-trusted her sketchbook to you. That\u2019s a good start. I feel so bad for her I\u2019m glad she has one good parent who sees her as an actual human being rather than property at best and a complication at worst.\n\nHer siblings broke her things- likely took some things and her mom and mom\u2019s husband do nothing.\n\nThen they proceed to violate her trust and act like she\u2019s some problem child.\n\nSeriously this girl really needs to get out of that house. She may not have issues yet but If she stays in that house she\u2019s definitely gonna need some serious therapy in the future.\n\nNTA", "No one has a right to their kids mind. \n\nShe isn\u2019t property. \n\nShe\u2019s a human with emotions and feeling and wants and needs", "I\u2019m not sure about the exact drawing since neither Jessica nor Claire actually showed me, but my daughter is a horror fan so I assume one of her more detailed monster drawings. She\u2019s shown me them before, and yeah they are a little creepy, but not to the level that she\u2019d need professional help.", "Found the ex-wife.", ">siblings invade each other's privacy, and siblings yell. There doesn't seem to be anything developmentally wrong with any of the kids' behavior.\n\nThey don't if you tell them not to. Kids are capable of learning and following rules, and not entering their sister's room unless she lets them is something they can absolutely learn to follow. Behavior also doesn't have to be developmentally wrong in order for it to be negative. Invading their sister's room and breaking her things is bad behavior that will only get worse if not corrected. It's not like as kids age, they magically get more mature and respectful-that has to be taught. \n\n>Considering how many news stories we've seen lately of kids doing horrible things and parents claiming to be unaware of the problems, I see why your ex thought she needed to check in.\n\nI don't. Mom had no reason to feel the need to \"check in.\" Her daughter had a normal reaction to her stuff being broken, and she presented no other signs of the kind of behavior you're thinking of. There's certainly no reason for mom to continue \"checking in\" when a psychologist cleared her. And if she wants to see into her daughter's head, why not just talk to her. Your kids will twll you what's going on if they trust you. \n\n>However, your daughter's behavior wasn't appropriate, and she didn't deserve a special breakfast.\n\nWhere was it not appropriate?\n\n>Having one rule at mom's house and a different one at dad's is going to backfire.\n\nIf the situation was that the mom and dad wanted to hold the sketchbook as part of a punishment for the daughter's behavior, that might be one thing. But she doesn't get to request to take her daughter's property just bc she wants it. And if you believe rules should be agreed on, what are your thoughts on the mom trying to make a new rule without discussing things with dad?", "Literally! No, daughter is a PERSON and has a right to privacy!", "The \"right\" she has, is to Talk/Communicate with Claire. She doesn't have the \"right\" to go through her personal items, sketchbook, diary, etc. That totally breaks the trust that the daughter has in her mother and may not ever be forgiven. It sounds like the mother is taking sides with the stepchildren which is probably devastating to Claire, feeling that she is alone \"against\" the rest.", "Thank God that was in a text message, easy to document", "I could not agree more. I mean they broke into her room and destroyed her private possessions and in response her mom reads her private journal containing her most private and innermost thoughts that she would likely never even verbalise in a million years and just put in there to get them out of her head so that she can actually process them healthily and then took her to a therapist likely to desperately try and get her diagnosed with something just to (in her mind) actually justify the horrifying violation of trust and privacy of her daughter. I mean she literally went that far to avoid being a parent to her other kids and actually hold them accountable for their behaviour! That is not normal. Op please get your kid out of there as soon as possible. Good luck.", ">obviously the shaming didn't work lol\n\nGlad it didn't! I got criticized for some of my poetry in high school after my mom looked through that too. Funny thing, I'm no contact with her, and met my husband 22 years ago at an open mike he was hosting! For anyone else who is currently dealing with this-- don't give up on your art/writing/craft just because someone tried to use it against you. It only means you are stronger than they know what to do with.", "Growing up with no privacy, i can tell you it sucked. Being told \u201ci had no right to privacy\u201d no lock on door, parents knew phone password. Now I have full freedom and good lord its so nice to have privacy", "Ikr, at 7 and 10 they\u2019re definitely old enough to know better.", "Lol I did this! Not a sketch book but my mom kept telling me I was on drugs, selling drugs, etc- that's how I had so much money.  (In reality, dad gave us $20/week for school lunch, but I never ate lunch. In a months time, I almost had $100... keep saving and after a few months, that's a few hundred).\n\nSo I did what any \"normal\" teenager does when their parent is saying they're doing drugs-- I stole the chalk from my school, diced it up on a piece of paper, folded the paper and left it out for my mom to \"accidentally\" find. \n\nAnd what did she do when she found the \"evidence\"? Absolutely nothing. Didn't even take me to the doctors to talk about how bad drugs were for a teenager (or anyone, but I was like 13/14 at the time). Freaked her out though.", "My parents definitely told me not to do things and I still did them, because children are sometimes disobedient. I never suggested that the children didn't deserve a consequence. \n\nAgain we don't know what the 12 year old said, I doubt a \"get outta my room\" was enough to schedule a therapy appointment. \n\nYelling at the siblings isn't appropriate, as you stated behavior can be appropriate and still negative. Screaming at your siblings is negative.\n\nThere's no way a trained psychologist said she's fine after one session. Anyone who has ever taken a kid to therapy knows, there are multiple sessions just to buil rapport. \n\nMy thoughts on mom making a new rule without dad's input is that mom sucks, hence ESH. There should have been a conversation on Sunday about the week. There should be some rules that apply no matter whose house you're in.", "Did that claim make anyone else think of the novel 1984?", "Yes!! OP\u2019s ex doesn\u2019t seem to know the difference between *privacy* and *secrets*. OP is such a good dad for not only realizing this, but also for taking the heat for poor Claire.", "I don\u2019t quite understand what you\u2019re saying about leaving state - why would a judge care about $600pcm going anywhere?", "My mom went through my stuff and took some of my poems to her PTA meeting to read them to friends.  If I wrote anything after that, I'd just throw it away after that because I couldn't trust her anymore.", "Sadly very true, especially when their child is the \u2018easier\u2019 e.g. quieter, well behaved kid who either reaches a breaking point or has a completely valid response to something upsetting while the new kids aka spoiled brats must be praised and accommodated", "Yeah, let's not make Claire more of a target . . .", "Who knows what was going on for your mother, but your experience is an example of medical neglect.  Good for you for getting what you need as an adult (plus, you get to choose your therapist, not your mom!).\n\nI have done periodic therapy throughout my life, but I'm doing it much more seriously now that I'm retired.  It's never too late!", "I hear you. In the early 90s we lived in a house with a built-in intercom system. When my responsible and hard-working sister had a sleepover with other classmates around age 12 my stepmother used the intercom system to secretly spy on their private conversations about boys and so on. She claimed it was her absolute right as step parent to understand everything going on in these young girls lives but I could tell at age 10 that this was a serious violation of privacy and I lost respect for that kind of thinking. If I had a choice between a parent like op versus the mum I would choose op every time.", "That runes idea is next-level! I hated your situation (had my journals read too) but loved your work-around.", "I started writing in pig pen code recently. My parents thought it was some child gibberish and they never bothered me again.", "That\u2019s one very impressive way to get around it", "Similar situation, I'm 17 now, and up until two months before my 17th birthday I had never had a bedroom door (because they didn't think I needed privacy until I was 17) and my parents monitored everything I did on my phone (which I didn't get until my 15th birthday) via our wifi setup. Now they're surprised that I don't want to be home or around them anymore.", "I swear I had the same experience. To the point I couldn\u2019t write anymore for years and now if I do, it\u2019s password locked and I hide it as the fifth layer in a pdf with the font colour set to white so even if they get the password (my father used to just smash the electronic if I refused to give the password) they would just see one of my textbooks. \n\nI\u2019m 28 and haven\u2019t lived with them for 9 years. We have a healthy relationship now but they aren\u2019t allowed in my house alone, snd we sweep anything they give us for bugs. \n\nI was published a few years ago and they interrogated me about it because \u201cfirst works are autobiographical.\u201d The themes were about controlling and intolerant parents, which had very little to do with them actually. If I ever actually become a published author (I don\u2019t count my currently published works) they won\u2019t be aware.", "Classic. My buddies and I went for the elder futhark for our notes.", "Okay I\u2019m really sorry you had to go through that but omg that is SUCH an awesome fix for such a crappy situation.\n\nLike oh I just casually learned an ancient language and taught my friends so we could talk privately.\n\nYou are awesome!", "This is the 3rd reference to this novel 1984 I have seen today. I guess I'm off to the library!", "Let me see how to say this. \n\nI live in a deep south red state, where my husband, his ex, and my stepdaughter grew up. Judges are elected, so they can get political donations. DCF in a lot of states gets a percentage of child support, so there's pressure to keep the $ amount high. Also this state is perpetually broke, and child support which leaves the state doesn't get spent in state and doesn't generate revenue through sales tax and other vehicles. Only 44% of children in this state get child support paid in full, so there's a lot of \"deadbeats.\" Add in \"Christians\" and conservatives who dominate politics and believe \"children need their mothers full time\" well, men don't get their kids here unless the mother can't be found.\n\nGiven the perfect storm of an out-of-state father (military) who made double the median income, who had a perfect record of payment going back a decade, (because the military makes sure you support your kids, by force if necessary) no way would a judge down here hand over custody. While my husband's case might have generated less than $1000/year in state revenue, multiple that by the thousands of military members stationed here who married a local girl and got divorced, and that starts to be a pretty good chunk of change that stays in state to be spent on the local economy rather than a smaller amount leaving the state and being spent elsewhere. \n\nLuckily for him/us, her lawyer was unfamiliar with federal law and believed the 10-year myth, so didn't go after his pension.", "Yeah i have been going to therapy for 3 years and it is really helping me. I'm mostly sad that kid me wasn't able to be her true self for so long, so I kinda feel like I'm still discovering my authentic self since I'm able to express myself without permission. It is a good feeling.", "my sibling just found my middle school portfolio. LEMME TELL YOU. ITS JUST AS EMBARASSING AS YOU THINK\n\n(allll the anime tho)", "Same here. Amazing thing is, our kid is a teen and we have good communication, so he tells us stuff we wouldn't even think to ask about. By being calm about the small stuff, he's comfortable telling us about things I think most parents don't hear from their kids.", "Exactly!"]}
