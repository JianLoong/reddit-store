Jessica is married to Chris (40m), who has two kids; Addie (7f) and Luke (10m). Claire spends one week at my place, one week with her mom. Sunday is the \u2018swap day\u2019. \n\nTwo weeks ago, Claire had a huge fight with her stepsiblings. Apparently they snuck into her room when she was away and went through her stuff, breaking some of her important items in the process, and Claire screamed at them when she found out. Jessica and Chris wrote off Addie and Luke\u2019s behavior as \u201ckids will be kids\u201d (I disagree, I think that Addie and Luke need a reality check for their behavior and that they shouldn\u2019t get away with it). However, they said that Claire\u2019s reaction was \u201cover the top\u201d and \u201ca sign that there\u2019s something wrong with her\u201d. \n\nJessica decided that she needed to \u201cfind out what\u2019s in Claire\u2019s head\u201d and so she confiscated Claire\u2019s sketchbook (which Claire uses to get her feelings out) and went through it. Apparently, what she found was \u201cdisturbing\u201d (Claire has showed me her sketchbook before and no it isn\u2019t) and took Claire to a psychologist for evaluation. \n\nSpoiler alert: they didn\u2019t find anything. My daughter is completely mentally healthy, save for (surprise surprise) stress from her step-siblings. \n\nAnyway, I got Claire last Sunday, and she spent her first few hours with me holed up in her room (sketching I think). At dinner, she told me what happened, and I surprised her with pancake breakfast the next morning to make her feel better. \n\nBefore I gave her back to Jessica, Claire asked me to keep her sketchbook at my house so her mom wouldn\u2019t look through it. I said yes, and she went over to her mom\u2019s place without it. \n\nYesterday, I got a text from Jessica. She said that she was \u201cworried that Claire forgot her sketchbook\u201d because when she went to confiscate it, it wasn\u2019t where Claire usually keeps it. She then asked me to arrange a time and place for her to pick it up. I said that the sketchbook was with me, and that I decided to keep it because I didn\u2019t want it confiscated again (I didn\u2019t want to throw Claire under the bus here, in hindsight lying probably wasn\u2019t the best idea). She said that I was being an AH because she \u201chas a right to her daughter\u2019s mind\u201d. I said that i was worried because of how she handled it last time she went through it. She restated her previous point, and I did not respond. \n\nIt\u2019s been about a day since that conversation, and I\u2019m starting to question my choice.

OP, Claire needs more support than should just fall on you, and she needs a safe, neutral third party to discuss this all with.

I LOVED drawing anime girls and anime characters in general, but my grandma told my mom I was drawing a pornagraphic picture one day (he was wearing swim trunks and I drew him swimming in the water so it was obvious) and let me tell you that really crushed my spirit and made me not want to draw anymore because I didn't want people to think the wrong thing and get me in trouble like that again. It really sucked. I used to love drawing, but I wasn't able to do it again peacefully until I moved out because everytime I would grab a pencil or paper my mom and grandma would ask if I was going to draw porn.

Otherwise, it'll only get worse and worse. Changing the arrangement won't make Claire's stress fully go away since her parents aren't together and all kids want their parents to be together forever, but at least she will have some sense of stability. You could talk to Claire about it to see how she feels and see what would make her the most comfortable. It's always good to check in with kids on these types of things because their experience/perspective is very real and valid, especially if this swapping thing has been going on for a long time. I'm sure with how Jessica is, it will be tough to get her to agree to this change if that's what Claire wants to do, so it should be made clear to her that it is Claire's decision and not yours.

I know this one from personal experience - not a sketchbook, but a diary. My mother used to read mine, which I found out when she cornered me one night and told me that nothing I wrote was actually what had happened, and that I wasn't allowed to write or even *think* bad things about her, or that she was anything other than a perfect parent. This after years of mostly emotional but occasionally physical abuse. If someone tells you that everything you've experienced is invalid and wrong, and threatens or forces you into psychiatric care if you don't immediately back down?

Screaming at your siblings is negative.\n\nI do agree that it's negative, but in the context of the situation it is underatandable. Now, I think the appropriate way to handle the situation would have been to let Claire know that there was no need to scream bc there would be consequences for the kids' behavior and they would try to fix her things as much as possible, and then give the kids an adequate punishment and teach them proper boundaries. I also have to wonder if this is the straw that broke the camel's back. If mom excuses behavior this severe, there's no telling what else she excuses. Maybe Claire has been dealing with this kind of mistreatment for a while and finally snapped. \n\n>There's no way a trained psychologist said she's fine after one session. Anyone who has ever taken a kid to therapy knows, there are multiple sessions just to buil rapport. \n\nAn evaluation isn't therapy, though. Therapy is generally designed to help patients develop coping mechanisms for the issues they are dealing with and learn to deal with them in a knowledgeable, healthy manner. Usually, you already have a diagnosis or at least some idea of what you're dealing with before going in. A therapist may diagnose a patient if they notice signs of a disorder, of course, after studying them for a while. \n\nBut an evaluation is specifically designed to determine if someone *may* have signs or symptoms of behavioral, personality, or neurological disorders. The psychological will be informed of the concerning behavior, have a session that usually involves mutliple tests specifically designed to study that behavior, and then make an assessment based on all the information. It sounds like the mom brought Claire in either for what she believed was disturbing social behavior (yelling at the kids) or disturbing thoughts or the like. Stuff like that is pretty easy for a psychologist to determine in an evaluation-it's really hard for kids, even teenagers, to hide that unless they're expert manipulators. The fact that the psychologist found nothing concerning simply means there weren't any signs that Claire's behavior was actually as disturbing as mom thought. Does that mean she's not dealing with anything else, like depression or a different behavioral issue? No, but most likely this evaluation was geared toward potential disturbing behavior and not a general assessment of her mental state and possible disorders.", "To be fair....those AOL chat Rooms were the wild fucking west.
