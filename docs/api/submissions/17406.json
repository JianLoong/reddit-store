{"id": 17406, "submission_id": "13jdsh8", "title": "AITA for letting my daughter keep her sketchbook at my house after her mom looked through it without permission?", "selftext": "So, to start, I have 50/50 custody of my daughter Claire (12f) with my ex-wife Jessica. Jessica is married to Chris (40m), who has two kids; Addie (7f) and Luke (10m). Claire spends one week at my place, one week with her mom. Sunday is the \u2018swap day\u2019. \n\nTwo weeks ago, Claire had a huge fight with her stepsiblings. Apparently they snuck into her room when she was away and went through her stuff, breaking some of her important items in the process, and Claire screamed at them when she found out. Jessica and Chris wrote off Addie and Luke\u2019s behavior as \u201ckids will be kids\u201d (I disagree, I think that Addie and Luke need a reality check for their behavior and that they shouldn\u2019t get away with it). However, they said that Claire\u2019s reaction was \u201cover the top\u201d and \u201ca sign that there\u2019s something wrong with her\u201d. \n\nJessica decided that she needed to \u201cfind out what\u2019s in Claire\u2019s head\u201d and so she confiscated Claire\u2019s sketchbook (which Claire uses to get her feelings out) and went through it. Apparently, what she found was \u201cdisturbing\u201d (Claire has showed me her sketchbook before and no it isn\u2019t) and took Claire to a psychologist for evaluation. \n\nSpoiler alert: they didn\u2019t find anything. My daughter is completely mentally healthy, save for (surprise surprise) stress from her step-siblings. \n\nAnyway, I got Claire last Sunday, and she spent her first few hours with me holed up in her room (sketching I think). At dinner, she told me what happened, and I surprised her with pancake breakfast the next morning to make her feel better. \n\nBefore I gave her back to Jessica, Claire asked me to keep her sketchbook at my house so her mom wouldn\u2019t look through it. I said yes, and she went over to her mom\u2019s place without it. \n\nYesterday, I got a text from Jessica. She said that she was \u201cworried that Claire forgot her sketchbook\u201d because when she went to confiscate it, it wasn\u2019t where Claire usually keeps it. She then asked me to arrange a time and place for her to pick it up. I said that the sketchbook was with me, and that I decided to keep it because I didn\u2019t want it confiscated again (I didn\u2019t want to throw Claire under the bus here, in hindsight lying probably wasn\u2019t the best idea). She said that I was being an AH because she \u201chas a right to her daughter\u2019s mind\u201d. I said that i was worried because of how she handled it last time she went through it. She restated her previous point, and I did not respond. \n\nIt\u2019s been about a day since that conversation, and I\u2019m starting to question my choice.

OP, Claire needs more support than should just fall on you, and she needs a safe, neutral third party to discuss this all with.

I LOVED drawing anime girls and anime characters in general, but my grandma told my mom I was drawing a pornagraphic picture one day (he was wearing swim trunks and I drew him swimming in the water so it was obvious) and let me tell you that really crushed my spirit and made me not want to draw anymore because I didn't want people to think the wrong thing and get me in trouble like that again. It really sucked. I used to love drawing, but I wasn't able to do it again peacefully until I moved out because everytime I would grab a pencil or paper my mom and grandma would ask if I was going to draw porn.
