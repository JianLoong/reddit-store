She's not being respectful of your agreements and that's a massive problem that definitely needs to be addressed.

She screwed up big time and I get why you reacted so strongly and acted the way you did. \n\nBut what you did was rough. None of the boundaries you set were unreasonable in isolation, but you enacted the decision before discussing it. This was not a calm logical choice, this was punishment to exert control in a situation where you feel she is taking away your ability to control the finances. \n\nTo be clear, I don't mean coercive control. I mean that you felt powerless so you took action to regain your power over your own financial situation. But you did that without even telling her until it was done, which is a breach of trust in the same way her action was. In both situations, there was an agreement in place and one of you took action counter to that agreement without consultation. \n\nIf you want the relationship to recover, both of you need to take accountability for the ways you disrespected each other and broke trust, then repair and find ways to avoid repeating this pattern in the future.

And why are you paying her CC bill if she had access to the bank account? And why does she have unlimited free spending power with her income--I assume you have a college education plan for your daughter and are comfortable with your retirement strategy? Otherwise I fail to see where laser hair removal fits in on an already-tight monthly budget. No need to answer. \n\nYour collective relationship with money sounds unsustainable long-term and you are E-S-H for implementing an unworkable solution.

But this does remind me very much of my mother so I wanted to share my perspective.\n\nMy mom has been a SAHM her entire life and has never had her own source of income. My father loves her so much and would give her the moon if he could afford it, but regardless of that attitude on his part, she has always felt uncomfortable spending \"his money\".\n\nThe result of this is that my dad has pretty clearly had more nice things than my mom, often despite his best efforts. Because he knows exactly what the budget is, he knows exactly what hes \"allowed\" to spend, and he doesn't feel any guilt or hesitation spending it. If he wants that new game console and they can afford it, he gets it! Which is awesome for him and what he should do. But if my mom wants to get her hair done, 90% of the time she talks herself into using a cheap at home dye because she feels guilty wasting the money. Even if they definitely can afford it.\n\nNow that my siblings and I are adults my mom finally went back to work part time and it is amazing to see her finally getting to have fun with money!! For the first time she is really going out and treating herself to things she felt guilty buying for years.\n\nOf course I don't know if that's the same situation but I would try to really think about how she has felt with this financial situation and consider that maybe in her mind she got this job so she would be allowed to save up for and enjoy what she wants. \n\nEspecially with her being a SAHM out of necessity as you said in a previous comment, you have to really consider how her lack of financial independence has affected her mental health and ability to feel like she can have things she wants or spend money on fun.\n\nWhy I think YTA is you went nuclear with out trying to talk to her and understand her side at all. And since she is a SAHM against her choice, you have a huge obligation to support her financially, even if she takes on part time work. It's not okay to just take that away or make her feel like you're threatening her financial security. It is not okay to make her feel like you are punishing her for a purchase or choice you didn't like.\n\nYou need to sit down and really communicate with her or you guys are doomed. I think that there are lots of ways you could make this work where everyone feels it's fair (one example - pool money together and have a specific \"fun money\" amount you get each month that is the same) but it will only work if you are listening.", "I greatly appreciate your input here \ud83d\ude4f", "What OP failed to mention is that she is a SAHM and they share their small child together, so it's not quite as easy as cutting and running just because they have different perspectives over money.

So, you mean \"everything is shared so long as I want it to be.\" That's not shared. You're not appreciating your wife's financial vulnerability and the effect of that precarious existence on her psyche. \n\nSo your wife opened her own chequing account and you didn't like it. You're the one who bottled that up and said \"NBD\" - and now you're going nuclear on your family finances? Your behaviour is unpredictable and that's stressful.\n\nYou decided you can't trust your wife, but your response was essentially to say, \"well guess what, you can't trust me either\" then pull the rug out. Is that healthy?", "NTA - but you are supporting three people and she is supporting herself in these big expenses. Whether or not they are not too frequent, she needs to talk with you about it so that you are on the same page. If she cannot do that, then this relationship will have a rough road ahead.

Good luck", "NTA but now is the time to sit down and sort this out. \n\nYour fiance has clearly decided that her money is her money, and your money is shared money. That isn't something I would agree with. \n\nNow, I am going to make an assumption that she only works part time- or is only recently working- because she takes care of your shared child, and continues to take on more of the child care and home chores. So, it makes sense that you cover more of the bills and continue to do so. \n\nNow she is working, it is time to reconfigure the financials. My advice would be you each get X \"fun\" money, you each put X towards bills, and you each put X towards savings. That can be a set amount, or a percentage. \n\nNext, since she has made a few decisions- the large expense plus not putting money in the shared account- I would suggest you do keep separate credit cards, agree fully that any money coming out of the joint account must be agreed on by BOTH of you, and you get a prenup that keeps your finances safe.", "NTA - large purchases are joint decisions, she decided on laser hair removal unilaterally, she no longer has access to funds she shouldn't control", "You both need to figure out finances.  She was a SAHM by mutual agreement.  It will take some time for her to make progress on her career and for you both to be able to afford childcare, but when your daughter starts kindergarten that should get much easier.\n\nRight now I would suggest you both figure out what you each will have as \"fun money\" and have that auto-deposit into separate accounts.  That money can be spent on whatever without negotiation or discussion.  It can be saved up month by month or spent to the last cent the day it hits the private accounts.  Not something either of you controls for the other.\n\nThe rest is shared money and should be discussed on a regular basis and agreed upon before being spent.  You don't want to be that couple that has to ask each other before spending a dollar at the vending machine to avoid a fight, but you also don't want to be the couple that can't make ends meet or is broke at retirement.", "nta however your fiance  is seriously entitled and selfish. if you choose to marry her good luck lol", "NAH.

I can sense her desire to have financial independence and buy things that makes her happy. It\u2019s just difficult with how things are currently set up tbh. More communication on the issue is definitely needed surrounding this but it\u2019s difficult because we\u2019re coming from two different angles and past experiences with money.
