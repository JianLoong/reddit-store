I am the only one working full time and use my income to pay ALL bills. I\u2019m very vocal about the money we have being ours and our responsibility to budget and discuss large purchases before taking action as money is tight. Fianc\u00e9 just picked up a part time job (10-15 hours a week) and deposits this money into a separate account that only she has access to (although it was our understanding it would be deposited into our shared account). Either way I let it go, NBD.  Recently my fianc\u00e9 used money in \u201cher account\u201d (separate from our shared account) to expense a $1500  purchase for laser hair removal when it was our understanding that we\u2019d discuss pricing before taking action. Not the first time she\u2019s been persuaded to purchase an upsell package or something that we did not intend to buy in the first place. She offered to attempt a refund, and that was the last thing mentioned before I excused myself from the conversation out of frustration. No yelling or raised voices, I removed myself before anything of the sort because I was very annoyed and taken back.  After reflecting I came to realize she is entitled to that money and can spend it as she chooses, and that I have the same right with my money. \n\nAITA for removing her from my CC\u2019s as an authorized user and separating funds to a newly created checking account to force the idea that we need to discuss finances - ESPECIALLY big purchases?\n\nI was shocked when hearing of this purchase, and made my decision without any further discussion from a point of logic - not emotion. Once the topic was brought up (after discovering there was $0 in our shared checkings) I let her know not much had changed from my POV and I was still willing to pay all bills and expense purchases as usual with proper communication and that if she wanted to enjoy treats for herself she should use her \u201cown money\u201d since she\u2019s not interested in consistently budgeting. The only real change being her access to my CCs and the money we use for bills in the shared account. To be clear, she has over 5K in her account and access to her own personal CCs, we just use mine for simplicity. At her request we both agreed to put an equal amount in our shared account to keep it open and not incur penalties.  \n\nShe does not make purchases this big often but I notice a trend of her desiring more frivolous things and growing impatient when I mention saving or budgeting to make these purchases responsibly. At first things seemed ok but now she is upset and claiming I\u2019m very much in the wrong and treating her like a child. I don\u2019t regret my decision to protect myself, although this has royally blown up in my face well after the fact.

But you\u2019ll need to have a longer conversation with your wife about finances. I think the best advice I\u2019ve seen so far is agreeing to a fixed amount being contributed to the shared account (this can be proportional income, so your wife can contribute less since she earns less). \n\nAnd perhaps both sides agreeing to set aside a minimum amount into another account just for savings.

Be honest with us and yourself.\n\n\n\nYou only mention a single instance and she did actually talk to you about that olan before purchasing it, you just felt not included enough. And brush over the actual big thing- that she continuesly gets the money of her job on a account you dont acces too. \n\n\nShe is an adult and should contribute to your life together within her means. She definitly is the far bigger ahole here. \n\n\nTo start getting closer again maybe open a new savings account together? Where she is expected to contribute a set amount each month and the rest of her wage is her fun money?
