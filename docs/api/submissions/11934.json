She is able to spend, goes out to eat / to the bar and buys things that interest her like makeup with no problem.

She's not being respectful of your agreements and that's a massive problem that definitely needs to be addressed. The amount of money she spent is significant and definitely required a your yes before action. She screwed up big time and I get why you reacted so strongly and acted the way you did. \n\nBut what you did was rough. None of the boundaries you set were unreasonable in isolation, but you enacted the decision before discussing it. This was not a calm logical choice, this was punishment to exert control in a situation where you feel she is taking away your ability to control the finances. \n\nTo be clear, I don't mean coercive control. I mean that you felt powerless so you took action to regain your power over your own financial situation. But you did that without even telling her until it was done, which is a breach of trust in the same way her action was. In both situations, there was an agreement in place and one of you took action counter to that agreement without consultation. \n\nIf you want the relationship to recover, both of you need to take accountability for the ways you disrespected each other and broke trust, then repair and find ways to avoid repeating this pattern in the future. Therapy/ couple's counselling would probably be a good idea", "NTA for what you requested judgment on. This sounds like wilfull ignorance on your fianc\u00e9's part. If she couldn't figure out how to change direct deposit, then why didn't she ask HR, a colleague, her manager, or you? Then to not maintain budgets after trying three times. And why are you paying her CC bill if she had access to the bank account? And why does she have unlimited free spending power with her income--I assume you have a college education plan for your daughter and are comfortable with your retirement strategy? Otherwise I fail to see where laser hair removal fits in on an already-tight monthly budget. No need to answer. \n\nYour collective relationship with money sounds unsustainable long-term and you are E-S-H for implementing an unworkable solution. Recommend you two work with a financial planner even if short-term to sort out a path moving forward where both you share and trust one another to carry out the financial responsibilities of the household. Perhaps your fianc\u00e9 will absorb her responsibilities better if coming from a neutral third party.", "NTA", "You are most definitely NTA, but your relationship is on thin ice, at best.", "NTA. She views her money as only \u201chers\u201d and yours as \u201cours\u201d. You need to make whatever decisions you make about this clear and not up for debate.

Sensible man.  What's yours is hers but what's hers is her own!\n\nIt was time for a reality check", "NTA and I personally believe separate finances are for the best.

But this does remind me very much of my mother so I wanted to share my perspective.\n\nMy mom has been a SAHM her entire life and has never had her own source of income. My father loves her so much and would give her the moon if he could afford it, but regardless of that attitude on his part, she has always felt uncomfortable spending \"his money\".\n\nThe result of this is that my dad has pretty clearly had more nice things than my mom, often despite his best efforts. Because he knows exactly what the budget is, he knows exactly what hes \"allowed\" to spend, and he doesn't feel any guilt or hesitation spending it. If he wants that new game console and they can afford it, he gets it! Which is awesome for him and what he should do. But if my mom wants to get her hair done, 90% of the time she talks herself into using a cheap at home dye because she feels guilty wasting the money. Even if they definitely can afford it.\n\nNow that my siblings and I are adults my mom finally went back to work part time and it is amazing to see her finally getting to have fun with money!! For the first time she is really going out and treating herself to things she felt guilty buying for years.\n\nOf course I don't know if that's the same situation but I would try to really think about how she has felt with this financial situation and consider that maybe in her mind she got this job so she would be allowed to save up for and enjoy what she wants. \n\nEspecially with her being a SAHM out of necessity as you said in a previous comment, you have to really consider how her lack of financial independence has affected her mental health and ability to feel like she can have things she wants or spend money on fun.\n\nWhy I think YTA is you went nuclear with out trying to talk to her and understand her side at all. And since she is a SAHM against her choice, you have a huge obligation to support her financially, even if she takes on part time work. It's not okay to just take that away or make her feel like you're threatening her financial security. It is not okay to make her feel like you are punishing her for a purchase or choice you didn't like.\n\nYou need to sit down and really communicate with her or you guys are doomed. I think that there are lots of ways you could make this work where everyone feels it's fair (one example - pool money together and have a specific \"fun money\" amount you get each month that is the same) but it will only work if you are listening.", "I greatly appreciate your input here \ud83d\ude4f", "What OP failed to mention is that she is a SAHM and they share their small child together, so it's not quite as easy as cutting and running just because they have different perspectives over money. But this is definitely a moment to realign on spending.

Just didn\u2019t make sense to me for her to use her CCs and me keep up with the payments. After the fact it was revealed that she had an issue setting up direct deposit to our joint account and additional issues attempting to update it after starting. I did express my confusion around that at the time I realized the money was not going to our shared account but let it go as nothing changed on my end, still paying bills regardless of* that additional income.", "Not necessarily it really depends, my biggest ask is that big purchases be discussed on both ends not just hers. She often goes out and will get gas, food, house supplies, groceries, without needing to discuss. I\u2019m not trying to micro manage just want to monitor and plan for extra curricular spending. The things mentioned are \u201cbudgeted for\u201d and expected - except we don\u2019t actually budget on a month to month basis so there is no idea of if we\u2019re under or over our goal. Major issue I know.", "Lol I remember when my daughter was young and I would describe her age in fractions of a year (e.g., 3.25). \n\nShe doesn\u2019t sound homeschooled. You just do educational activities with her, which is awesome!\n\nI don\u2019t know whether you did the \u201cright\u201d thing or not regarding the finances. You two definitely need to sit down and discuss a life plan, if you\u2019re hoping to work things out.\n\nIt still wasn\u2019t cool for you to say describe her as \u201cmy daughter.\u201d Your whole post and response makes your fianc\u00e9 seem like a bit of an outsider. Maybe it was by accident, maybe it\u2019s reflective of how you really feel. I can\u2019t say. Just something to think about.\n\nGood luck!", "Appreciate your feedback! Agreed as well, it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re on the same page and I think we both recognize that, hence the outsider feeling you\u2019re picking up on. Not ideal for me but sometimes these things are out of our control. And to be clear I\u2019m not avoiding responsibility in this, I\u2019m genuinely trying my best.", "Oh, you don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re avoiding responsibility at all.\n\nI really hope you two are able to sit down and work through this. All the best moving forward!"]}
