Either way I let it go, NBD.  Recently my fianc\u00e9 used money in \u201cher account\u201d (separate from our shared account) to expense a $1500  purchase for laser hair removal when it was our understanding that we\u2019d discuss pricing before taking action. Not the first time she\u2019s been persuaded to purchase an upsell package or something that we did not intend to buy in the first place. She offered to attempt a refund, and that was the last thing mentioned before I excused myself from the conversation out of frustration. No yelling or raised voices, I removed myself before anything of the sort because I was very annoyed and taken back.  After reflecting I came to realize she is entitled to that money and can spend it as she chooses, and that I have the same right with my money. \n\nAITA for removing her from my CC\u2019s as an authorized user and separating funds to a newly created checking account to force the idea that we need to discuss finances - ESPECIALLY big purchases?\n\nI was shocked when hearing of this purchase, and made my decision without any further discussion from a point of logic - not emotion. Once the topic was brought up (after discovering there was $0 in our shared checkings) I let her know not much had changed from my POV and I was still willing to pay all bills and expense purchases as usual with proper communication and that if she wanted to enjoy treats for herself she should use her \u201cown money\u201d since she\u2019s not interested in consistently budgeting. The only real change being her access to my CCs and the money we use for bills in the shared account. To be clear, she has over 5K in her account and access to her own personal CCs, we just use mine for simplicity. At her request we both agreed to put an equal amount in our shared account to keep it open and not incur penalties.  \n\nShe does not make purchases this big often but I notice a trend of her desiring more frivolous things and growing impatient when I mention saving or budgeting to make these purchases responsibly. At first things seemed ok but now she is upset and claiming I\u2019m very much in the wrong and treating her like a child.

We\u2019ve had conversations around finances but nothing that stuck. I\u2019m always available to discuss finances and have attempted to implement budgeting many times. She is able to spend, goes out to eat / to the bar and buys things that interest her like makeup with no problem.

Luckily, if it\u2019s overnight, you and your little one should be sleeping. \n\nIt really sounds like it\u2019s time to sit down and discuss finances as well as how you all distribute your time/efforts.

I have trust issues with the education system and am not fond of shipping her off ASAP and with this realization I decided to take on the brunt of education in the meantime. During the day I work and when I\u2019m done I find 30 min - 1 hour to do school.
