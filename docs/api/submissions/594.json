Among other things, her  cat passed away this summer and the cat\u2019s ashes have been sitting at the vets since then. The vets office left a message and said that this is her last chance to pick up the ashes. They did not say what they would do with them if she didn\u2019t pick them up. I have been offering to do things for her and she finally said, \u201cmaybe you could go pick up the kitties ashes from the vet for me \u201c. She\u2019s too traumatized by the vet visit where the cat died to go back. So I said of course I would. The vet is about a 30 mile drive from me so I called to confirm that I could pick up my friends cat\u2019s ashes. They said no, unless they had her permission. When I told her that and asked her if she could give them a quick call, she got really mad at me. She thinks I should\u2019ve just gone to get them without calling because they wouldn\u2019t have asked for my ID. She just said \u201cforget it I\u2019ll get them myself\u201d and hung up on me.  I feel like a terrible person because I called instead of just going to pick up the box, but come to think of it, I guess her having to call would have traumatized her all over again anyway. Should I go to the vet and pretend that I\u2019m her and pick up the ashes? Or just forget it and let her deal with it?

They absolutely would have asked for ID to verify. How does she know they wouldn\u2019t?", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve worked in vet med on and off for 30 years. We would not release the ashes to some rando who just showed up. \n\nA possible alternative could be to ask that the ashes be mailed to the address on file. You could pay for the postage. \n\nWe (in vet med) often have issues where a couple has broken up and one person brings in the pet to be euthanized to get back at the other person. Or someone shows up to \u201csteal\u201d the ashes. To cover our own asses, we ask for ID if we don\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d the person. \n\nLike, even when it comes to meds or prescription food for my dog, I have to call the clinic if I want to have my partner pick it up and they check his ID. They know me and what I look like, they don\u2019t know him.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she's overwhelmed and taking it out on you, which isn't fair in the slightest. You offered to help and support her, and choosing to do so through legal means does not make you TA. \n\nIf you did go, pretend to be her, and pick up the ashes, there's a lot of people who could get into a lot of trouble for releasing the ashes to the wrong person without consent from the owner. And how would she even know if they were or were not checking ID?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know if it's office policy or if it's some kind of veterinarian industry regulation they have to follow, but they would not have told you this if they didn't intend to enforce it.", "NTA they have state laws on this thing.  They'd ask for ID.", "NTA. She does need to be at least minimally involved to get the ashes released to you. You were helping as much as you could and she just wanted it to be more than was possible. \n\nI hope she can pull herself together enough to communicate what\u2019s needed to get the ashes. It sounds like knowing they\u2019re unrecoverable would be much more traumatic.", "NTA. She's being irrational. Understandable, maybe, since she's having a hard time. Don't let this bother you.", "NTA - you can't control the circumstance, and you were simply being responsible. \n\nYour friends reaction was unreasonable and rude. I'd give them distance for a few days to come around"]}
