Months ago before this was decided, but while we were having issues we got sent an rsvp to her sisters wedding. My wife had rsvp that we were going. Even though we are no longer together my wife still expects me to go because she hasn't told her family yet. She hasn't told them because she has always had issues with feeling less than her sister and her family is very anti divorce. So she just wants to save face.\n\nAnother reason she wants me to come is because she doesn't think she can handle taking our three kids on a flight by herself. I told her if she thinks the kids will be too difficult to handle she can leave them all with me or even just take the oldest with her to the wedding. She says she has to bring them. I didn't know about this until now, but her sister had asked for our daughters to be the flower girls and our son to be the ring bearer. I don't think it's a huge issue if they can't make it, but my wife insists it will be and everyone will be gossiping about why they and I aren't there. \n\nAnother issue is that if we were all five to got to the wedding we would have to stay at her brother's house since we couldn't afford hotel rooms along with the cost of the plane tickets. We're on a budget since I'm basically supporting two households right now. Staying at her brother's house and pretending to be together when we are not is super awkward. I mean we've never been super lovey dovey in front of people, so that's not an issue. Neither is sleeping arrangements either since previously our younger kids would sleep with my wife in the guest room and I'd take the couch.

If she shows up sans spouse and potentially some of her children, gossip about your divorce could overtake the wedding. \n\nShe also needs to realize she's a single mom now and needs to figure out how to manage all her kids at times without your assistance.

You're mistaken in thinking the kids can just not go, as they're part of the wedding. They've probably already been told, and may already be excited. So at this point you need to ask yourself if you want to make sure your kids get to participate in a milestone event like participating in a wedding, or if you're just done with the whole situation. If you do go, you should make sure your wife tells her family now before you go. You don't want to get there and at some point it slips out and then you've got to personally deal with the fall out. \n\nBut, to answer your posted question, you're NTA.

Not for your wife but for the kids.  I am sure they want to be in the wedding, and if mom struggles with them then it will have an effect on the kids.  Also, you probably want to stay on good terms with your Ex-SIL as you never know when you might need her help with something.\n\nYou are well within moral rights to refuse to go, and I understand your anger about your STBX refusal to tell her family.  But the best thing over all is to suck it up, go, be a good father, play nice, but tell your STBX that if she does not tell her family within one week after the wedding, you will do it.", "NTA - saving face or controlling the gossip of third parties is very much not your responsibility. If your ex wants to take all the kids she needs to figure that out. The rational thing would be to tell her family that she needs a little extra help because you are no longer together. If she refuses to do that then she'll have to bear the consequences.", "NTA.  Your soon-to-be-ex saving face is not your problem.

Considering you are taking care of two households right now and have the weight of the family on you, I believe that it is absolutely your right to take care of your mental and financial health despite her insecurities.

That\u2019s the best plan, IMO. \n\nHowever, your soon to be ex doesn\u2019t want her family to know what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s her choice, and you don\u2019t have to have anything to do with her choice. Personally, I would not participate in that lie. \n\nIf my ex husband had asked me to travel to one of his family weddings while we were separated because he hadn\u2019t told his family about the impending divorce (and our kids were in the wedding), I\u2019d want to vomit.", "They are the flower girls and the ring holder!!!!!!!!!! That's not the point. Is there something important you are staying for or something?", "It sounds like they hadn't decided on a separation or divorce at that point.\n\nIt's not just about the cost, it's that it's a rude thing to do.", "no one said it was a blood contract, there's a lot of room in between \"breaking a blood contract\" and \"being rude\"", "\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "Then why did you make it a point?", "Unless someone's safety is in question, none of this obligates OP to lie about the divorce.", "Divorce/separation isn't included in the list of reasons that would make you rude for not attending an event you RSVPd to. Let them know you can't make it and why. Done and done.", "That\u2019s quite a conclusion you\u2019ve jumped to.  Do you love her?", "I misworded, sorry. The point that I'm saying is not a point is that you are happy to watch them yourself.", "\u2026right, see, that\u2019s why I said *\u201cTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying OP has to go.\u201d* Go ahead, you can reread my earlier comment, you\u2019ll see it!", "You really can\u2019t see how \u201cunilaterally inform the family the wife is fighting tooth and nail not to inform\u201d might be a GIGANTIC fight?", "I used to", "You made it a point that I should have some responsibility for them. If that's a point then I don't see why me watching them can't be a point too.", "That's actually very profound. It is absolutely possible for someone to destroy those feelings."]}
