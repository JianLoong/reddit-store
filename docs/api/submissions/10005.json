She has a 17-year-old daughter I'll call Jess.\n\nOver the weekend, Jess had a school event and had asked me for a ride in advance. I didn't mind in the slightest. I drove her over to the school and we had a nice chat in the car. When she got out though, a bunch of her friends were there, and she waved to me and shouted \"Later creepy stepdad!\" with a huge smile. I think it was a joke to her friends? They laughed and I stared awkwardly for a few seconds. Then Jess said \"Go, go!\" literally shooing me away.\n\nI drove home thinking whatever, but over time it started to really grate on me. I know that she wanted to just show off for them, but I didn't want to be stuck in a car with a girl who considered me creepy in any way. I shot her a text around that time that she would have to find another way to get home.\n\nShe didn't see my text for some time, but a few hours later she called me asking for a ride. I told her that I couldn't do that as I had had a couple of drinks (which was true). Then she half hung up on me and apparently called her mother.\n\nAmy was busy working on something at the time, and told me that I needed to get over there and pick her up. I responded that she could walk, get a ride from her friends, or take public transportation. It was 8pm in one of the safest cities in our country and that she was going to be fine. Amy then walked away, grabbed my keys, and drove off in my car, despite having a suspended license.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later Amy came home and shrieked at me about my treatment of Jess while Jess evacuated to her room. I told her that she really shouldn't be driving without a suspended license, and Amy said she wouldn't have to if I were more responsible. When I reminded her of why her license was suspended she got furious (it's a pretty touchy subject) and told me she'd leave if she had anywhere else to go. I brushed her off with a lame \"that sounds like a you problem\" and we haven't talked since.\n\nWas I being an asshole here?", "created_utc": 1676451311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112tldu/aita_for_not_picking_my_girlfriends_daughter_up/", "score": 4690, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Literally the best of friends roast the absolute hell out of each other because teenage years are a weird time for emotional vulnerability and especially with you you've only been in her life a year she may not feel comfortable getting sappy with you yet.  She said it with a smile and the fact that she was willing to refer to you as \"step-dad\" even jokingly  and come to you for a ride means she sees you as a potential father figure and was messing around with you to show her affection then you got butt hurt and didn't keep an arrangement you had made because of it. You could've called her and voiced your concerns, you could've talked about them after you picked her up instead of leaving her stranded or at the very least not drank in case she needed you for an emergency. Teenagers make dumb choices but their safety comes above all else, punishment and talks can come later. I don't care how \"safe\" the city is a 17 year old girl should not be walking or on public transport alone at night. What if something happened to her? Would your pettiness be worth it then?

As a parent, she chose the later, and you can debate that parenting choice with her if you wish. When she returned from dealing with the hard choice you put her in, you brushed off her experience by saying \u201cyour problems, even if I cause them, aren\u2019t my problems\u201d.

I don't care if you're trying to act chill in front of your friends. You stop that, or she needs to get shut down quickly. \n\nMom sucks because driving without a license and taking your keys and shouting her anger out at you. \n\nY'all all need counseling and coaching on how to better communicate.

From the post it appears that you were expected to pick her up from the beginning.

She admitted to being angry and wanting to get back at him. She appeared to be genuinely sorry and tried to make amends, but it was too late. She ruined her relationship with him and almost wrecked her mothers marriage with her stepdad. \n\nHe and the mom are still together, but he now has very firm and strict boundaries with the daughter. He will not be anywhere alone with her, won\u2019t drive her places, if she calls him he will always put it on speaker phone, etc. (She is in her late 20s now and he still keeps these rules.)

This feels like a very important part of the way things were handled. Does Amy know why OP refused to pick Jess up? Does Jess understand that her behaviour was completely inappropriate? I feel like this is a very teachable moment and could sway the result immensely. OP, if you haven\u2019t brought this up with them yet, I hope it\u2019s on the immediate horizon.", "Ok but.... What if OP IS a creep?", "All of this! Knowing his GF couldn\u2019t legally drive to get her kid, it sounds like he was on a bit of a power trip to me.", "Exactly. I was thinking the same thing. I could see his reaction coming from someone who\u2019s in their 20s not someone who\u2019s almost 40. \n\nHis reaction was just petty and spiteful.", "I don\u2019t see anything wrong with having a few drinks and being responsible about not driving.", "I agree with you. Kid is SEVENTEEN. There are other ways to get home when you called your stepdad \u201ccreepy\u201d for whatever reason when he dropped you off. \n\nAnd he should not want to be alone with her whether that was a joke or not just to be on the safe side. I\u2019m on his side here. I wish he\u2019d included whether he told the mom this or not. \n\nTons of red flags from mom as well. She honestly sounds pretty bad. Not disclosing her actual age? Wtf", "This, the first thing that came to my mind is I'm wouldn't spend a single second alone with that girl ever again after that. And I may even need cameras filming me when she's around... That's a straight to jail card if he ever gets accused of anything.", "She could lie about her age like her mother\u2026", "Not only does she not have anywhere to go, but she weirdly hold it over HIS head?\n\u201cI\u2019d abandon you if I weren\u2019t finically dependent on you!\u201d \nOkkkk cool?", "Yet in just a few short months this sub will say that the 18 year old is an adult and is fully capable of fending for herself.  Kind of hard to say that a matter of months is the difference between being a functional adult and a child that's not responsible for their actions.", "But what if he is, in fact, creepy?", "No ones life is being ruined, and the whole point of this sub reddit is to ask us to be the judge!", "Why would he have to explain why he didn't pick her up? The point is her mom took his car and drove without a license.", "Or he simply could say he didn't pick her up. Cops won't care why he didn't pick his girlfriend's kid.", "Look at how toxic this whole family is. There's nothing wrong with being upset, but how he reacts shows that he has the emotional maturity of a teen himself.", "Why are we assuming OP is lying to us? That defeats the point of the sub. We have to take the story at face value. He said he wasnt creepy, he never acted creepily in the story, we have to assume he isn\u2019t.", "Nailed it!", "> And she would leave IF she had somewhere else to go \u2026\u2026\n\nThat'd be it for me. \n\n\"But you do have somewhere else to go!\" \n\n*points at door*", "She even said she'd leave if she had anywhere to go.

For under $10.\n\n(Sure, those prices are from the 90s, but you can still do the same trip for about $40 today)", "When they filled out the application for where they live. If they move ever travelled together. Etc.", "> Yeah, like how do you not know your live in partner\u2019s real birth date?\n\ni have to know my wife's birthday when i go pick up her meds from the pharmacy. I figured this is pretty standard.", ">I mean but they apparently LIVE with him. So he should be more concerned about the daughter living in his house rather than just a car ride imo.\n\nYup -- THIS.\n\nIf he truly felt he was going to get arrested in the school parking lot because his step-daughter called him \"creepy stepdad\" with a cheery smile and a wave, then... why does he feel safe having her SLEEP in his house??\n\nIf Jess came home to sleep in OP's house, then his argument that he didn't want to be \"alone\" with her is bull, because living in the same house, they will be alone/\"unattended\" several times a day.\n\nOP got his feelings hurt and retaliated by not picking Jess up. \n\nAs others mentioned, he could have gone to get Jess *with Amy* (because Amy can't legally drive herself) -- he wouldn't be \"alone\" with Jess, Jess would have a safe ride home, Amy isn't breaking the law.\n\nInstead, OP chose to not say anything to Amy, and chose to drink enough that he was too \"tipsy\" to drive (so, more than 2 drinks unless the event was under two hours).\n\nPretending that he just \"happened\" to decide to have a beer or two, just out of the blue, is disingenuous. He did it because he wanted to make sure Amy couldn't force him to drive -- he wanted to punish Jess for her \"joke\". \n\n(Yes, it was a stupid \"joke\". Given the situation OP described, this was clearly a \"joke\"/not serious. As a high school teacher, I've heard kids call their parents all kinds of names. You can tell when it's a kid venting and when it's a kid describing abuse. Yes, were mandatory reporters, but that doesn't mean we call CPS to report abuse any time a kid says their parent was \"mean\".)\n\nUnless OP tells Amy and Jess to move out TONIGHT, then he knows Jess was not serious, it was not a real (or plausible) \"accusation\", and he's not on danger.", "Cheers! \ud83d\ude0e", "Bullshit if op were a step mother giving this exact story they'd still be the irresponsible ah", "actually he gave her plenty of head's up", "Sounds like a THEM problem\n\nNTA", "Teenagers don\u2019t answer their phones.

Not that mine has ever pulled this shit .", "I totally agree. I was in college at 17. I walked to and from my high school, two miles each way. I biked all over town to get to work. Let\u2019s stop the entitlement of this teen, by making her responsible for finding a ride or taking the bus.", "Does she have PayPal, money in a bank account, or mom\u2019s credit card?", "She\u2019s definitely 50", "Honestly I think everyone is being a tad bit dramatic about the creepy comment, like the daughter was obviously laughing with the friends about it so I doubt she\u2019s about to try and put the police on the guy. \n\nHe said he was gonna pick her up and he should have, we live in a world that\u2019s just a tad bit to dangerous for me to think it was okay to force her to try and find another ride after already promising.\n\nBut honestly though, ESH the communication in this family seems incredibly awful.", "Plus he isn\u2019t the father or stepfather", "Female or male", "It\u2019s because she\u2019s older than she lets him assume she is. Mid 40s after a year of dating really means 48-52", "Tell the real age, cannot drive legally, has no place to live but his home.  She is just using this guy.", "Who knows? Maybe she should have thought about that before insulting her ride.", "I feel like no one is considering the possibility here that OP may actually be creepy. Someone needs to sit down with the daughter and ask her why she said that.", "Yeah they understand, that's what's 'funny' about it to begin with.", "Without being there, I don't know if Jess was being rude or just thought she was being funny. Teens do faux pas sometimes. In fact, sometimes the joke is something like \"it's so obvious that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, so I'll joke about it being \\_\\_\\_.\" In your case, \"it's so obvious that I don't consider you creepy that I can joke about it;\" I guess it's sort of like irony? Anyway, some people can handle that type of humor, some never, and some with only certain topics.\n\nSo I can't say that \\*everyone\\* sucks, because I don't know if it was a youthful misstep, or if she meant to be mean.\n\nAmy was busy, but that's besides the point because she has a suspended license and can't drive even if not busy. She sort of sucks for driving anyway, because if she gets caught, the consequences are even worse, and some people drive poorly when angry. I don't know how safe the area truly is, or the walking distance, or if Jess has ever used Uber or public transit before. I don't think it's fair to drop it on her that she could use some method of getting home that she hasn't been taught before.\n\nSo, you were the only one in the household legal to drive, you knew she'd as for a ride home, and yet you had alcohol. If you were over the legal BAL, shame on you for drinking so much, and if you were under and could have driven, shame on you for making an excuse.\n\nI'm going to go with YTA, based on what I know. It doesn't sound like she's ever done something before that's gotten you to the point where she'd be on her last chance for rides, so dropping this on her is a bit much. I wish you could have addressed the comment right then and there, but you weren't going to get an honest reaction with her friends watching on.\n\nYou should have picked her up and told her how you feel, then called a family meeting to talk it out. If she didn't mean anything by it, she can apologize and be more thoughtful next time. If she was being a brat, then do the consequence. But kids need to feel that they can make mistakes without being abandoned, and be taught how to do better.\n\nI have gone back and between everyone sucking, asking for information, and YTA. But why ask you to explain every detail on the internet? You had the most control here, because you're legal to drive, and you knew she'd need a ride. I want to give you credit for possibly not knowing better parenting strategies and maybe not needing to, based on how long you've been in this relationship. It's not like you're the biggest jerk in the world, but you could have done better. Hopefully everyone learns from these events so next time there's not a fight.  \n\n\nETA: If you felt uneasy being alone in the car with her after being called creepy, Amy should have gone with you to pick her up, busy or not. Her kid is more important than her task.", "Why is she in your home", "That\u2019s what bothered me the most about this- yes she is a teen and they can screw up sometimes, but talk about it AFTER she gets home safely. Depending on the area, it may be totally unsafe for her to find her own way home. \n\nOP was out of line.", "He still should\u2019ve informed her mom about everything that happened and about refusing to drive. And why the hell were his keys available for her to take and steal the car? She shouldn\u2019t be driving with a suspended license.", "yeah, people that always say this, seem to forget, you've only got 2 cheeks to turn, then the righteous fury cometh", "Way creepier he didn\u2019t tell mom. Somethings fishy", "Absolutely; what she did was definitely out of line but clearly doesn't justify abandoning her without a way home and not even telling her mum he'd done so", "The whole thread is so gross automatically dismissing the girl. A good stepdad would have been like, what?!!! And then looped mom in and asked why she felt that way.\n\nWhat if OP is leering at her sometimes? I mean, there\u2019s disgusting subreddits on this site where people share pics and fantasies of their and their partners teens. It\u2019s really not unheard of.", "Like.... Odds are she has had at least 1 birthday since they started dating. This isn't a \"oh it never came up,\" it's \"she will not tell me and I have accepted that.\"", "Plus all that action did was confirm to the teenager that her stepdad is a \u201ccreep\u201d or untrustworthy or whatever. The comment was something they could have worked through but now there\u2019s no going back. Step dad will remain a villain in her mind. I\u2019m willing to bet this wasn\u2019t the first time OP has been a vengeful child like that.", "Or 53 since she won't tell her ahe", "The only conversation is: how fast can Jess and Amy be out of OPs place.\n\nThey are both toxic in their own ways. Maybe Amy doesn\u2019t want I state her age because she has wants & warrants? \n\nJess sounds like she would burn down the house (teenage thing). \n\nOP is smoking cigs standing in a puddle of gasoline. Bru cut and run. \n\nHere e Seth the lesson", "Am I the only one who thinks she\u2019s trying to break them up, but is too dumb to realize the irl implications of what she said?", "Absolutely; it's a very odd way to deal with this that clearly makes the problem worse", "After her calling him a creepy stepdad, and his sending her a text, I don't think there is any way he should have to pick her up. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why he didn't tell his girlfriend what the daughter said.\n\nNTA.", "She called him creepy stepfather at the drop-off. Publicly. That's a reason not to pick her up", ">He dropped someone off knowing he was their ride. If he had told her before they left that\u2019d be different, they could make round-trip plans or stay home but he didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen she called him \"creepy stepdad\" in front of people, she basically opted out of him picking her up. Why would he put himself in a position to be alone with a 17 year old girl who calls him creepy in front of people?", "This. If it were me and I wanted the relationship to continue, I'd sit down with both of them and explain why her actions mean that I can't be alone with the daughter, at least for a while, for my own protection. 99% chance it was just a dumb comment to impress friends and there's no hint of a false allegation, but she needs to know how serious that sht is.", "100% this is the answer and you should be at the very top of the thread... OP could be in a very dangerous legal position if step daughter decides to \"teach him a lesson\"", "That is the part a lot of people are missing. They can never share space again. There is no coming back from this.", "This^ \nSo much this. \nI won\u2019t drive my kids\u2019 friends home from sports practice  without one of my kids being in the vehicle, because I just will *not* put myself in a situation where there could be even a possibly for an accusation. To have it coming from the stepdaughter\u2026 sheesh, I don\u2019t know how to even deal with that. OP doesn\u2019t have a lot of good options here, but I 100% agree to not *ever* being alone with that girl until a long, satisfactory conversation was had with her and her mother. People\u2019s lives get ruined by shit like this.", "I wondered too.", "I agree. If someone called my creepy I'd not stick around. I'd be afraid of something worse being said in the future. However, he should have immediately called her mom to make other transport arrangements for the daughter, then start packing the stuff of whomever would be moving out. I'm female and wouldn't feel safe around that.", "this is bonkers. if being called creepy makes you alienate your kid like that, you shouldn't have kids.", "Agreed, and if were him, I'd definitely not ever be alone with her again. Especially now that she's pissed and could easily make an untrue accusations. He probably needs to rethink this relationship anyway as the GF won't even tell him her exact age. Wtf is up with that?", "This is ridiculous. I am all for safety of women and children and people might call me a helicopter but like I said this kid would never see me again at least never in a car. Hayyyy no. NTA. The Y T A\u2019s even the E S H are all wrong.", "Which is at least a little creepy honestly", "When I was 17, I lived in a small town with no public transportation. The high school was in the next town over, 13 miles from my house. I had a license but no car. I also didn't have a bike and very few friends, most of whom also didn't have cars. I would have been screwed in this instance. The girl expecting the person who said he would pick her up to actually pick her up isn't entitlement. Let's stop pretending that everybody's circumstances are the same.", "Esh because he didnt told her mom.", "This is one of the more rational comments I've seen. People are acting like this guy's life is going to be instantly ruined, or like one ill-advised joke means she's going to make a serious accusation later.\n\nEven if she did, this isn't Gone Girl. You can't just screw a wine bottle and convince the whole world it was NPH. He'll be fine. If this happened to me, I'd just show the girl this comment section so she'll understand how many irrational people there are in the world. That will probably discourage future jokes.", ".... why would it not be appropriate?", "Luckily I don't want kids and am taking all possible measures to prevent that from occurring  \ud83d\ude09", "He states that Amy grabbed his keys and left in his car, driving on a suspended license, and returned 15 minutes later, after picking up her daughter. The high school had to of been within a mile or so, to return that quickly. The sense of entitlement comes through, from the girl\u2019s actions towards OP, after him dropping her off. No \u201cthank you\u201d, just referring to him as creepy and shooing him off.", "How would that have helped anything?"]}
