She has a 17-year-old daughter I'll call Jess.\n\nOver the weekend, Jess had a school event and had asked me for a ride in advance. I didn't mind in the slightest. I drove her over to the school and we had a nice chat in the car. When she got out though, a bunch of her friends were there, and she waved to me and shouted \"Later creepy stepdad!\" with a huge smile. I think it was a joke to her friends? They laughed and I stared awkwardly for a few seconds. Then Jess said \"Go, go!\" literally shooing me away.\n\nI drove home thinking whatever, but over time it started to really grate on me. I know that she wanted to just show off for them, but I didn't want to be stuck in a car with a girl who considered me creepy in any way. I shot her a text around that time that she would have to find another way to get home.\n\nShe didn't see my text for some time, but a few hours later she called me asking for a ride. I told her that I couldn't do that as I had had a couple of drinks (which was true). Then she half hung up on me and apparently called her mother.\n\nAmy was busy working on something at the time, and told me that I needed to get over there and pick her up. I responded that she could walk, get a ride from her friends, or take public transportation. It was 8pm in one of the safest cities in our country and that she was going to be fine. Amy then walked away, grabbed my keys, and drove off in my car, despite having a suspended license.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later Amy came home and shrieked at me about my treatment of Jess while Jess evacuated to her room. I told her that she really shouldn't be driving without a suspended license, and Amy said she wouldn't have to if I were more responsible. When I reminded her of why her license was suspended she got furious (it's a pretty touchy subject) and told me she'd leave if she had anywhere else to go. I brushed her off with a lame \"that sounds like a you problem\" and we haven't talked since.\n\nWas I being an asshole here?", "created_utc": 1676451311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112tldu/aita_for_not_picking_my_girlfriends_daughter_up/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Literally the best of friends roast the absolute hell out of each other because teenage years are a weird time for emotional vulnerability and especially with you you've only been in her life a year she may not feel comfortable getting sappy with you yet.  She said it with a smile and the fact that she was willing to refer to you as \"step-dad\" even jokingly  and come to you for a ride means she sees you as a potential father figure and was messing around with you to show her affection then you got butt hurt and didn't keep an arrangement you had made because of it. You could've called her and voiced your concerns, you could've talked about them after you picked her up instead of leaving her stranded or at the very least not drank in case she needed you for an emergency. Teenagers make dumb choices but their safety comes above all else, punishment and talks can come later. I don't care how \"safe\" the city is a 17 year old girl should not be walking or on public transport alone at night. What if something happened to her? Would your pettiness be worth it then?

As a parent, she chose the later, and you can debate that parenting choice with her if you wish. When she returned from dealing with the hard choice you put her in, you brushed off her experience by saying \u201cyour problems, even if I cause them, aren\u2019t my problems\u201d.

Raise your emotional intelligence as well.", "Ouch.  Yup, YTA.  17 year old girls stay dumb stuff for dumb reasons.

She probably expected you to smile and say \u201cLater!\u201d And drive off.  \n\nBut you overthought it and decided to not pick her up.  From the post it appears that you were expected to pick her up from the beginning.  Then it disintegrated into an ESH event.\n\nIf you want to salvage these relationships, go to your girlfriend and her daughter, and apologize.

I'm sorry, she's tarnishing his reputation, and what if another parent hears op being referred to as such?\n\nI'm guessing from the mother's reaction that this is what she's taught her daughter. Both need to apologise.  Quite frankly, op needs to rethink the whole relationship.", "Whether or not OP had a massive overreaction is beside the point.\n\nFact remains if the teenage daughter of his 40-something girlfriend talks about OP, who's in his late 30s, as a creep to her friends, there's no telling if or when that little shit can escalate her nonsense and bring the law down on OP's entire life, ruining his reputation and career and social standing and future in one moment of \"oops haha that was meant to be a joke\"\n\nOP is well off far the fuck away from both these idiots imo", "... This was not some small fuck up. This is something that could have serious repurcussions on the rest of OPs life had the wrong person heard and reached the wrong conclusion.\n\nShe's 17. That's less than a year away from being an adult. That is, IMO, several years past the point of  forgiving a 'mistake' like this due to 'oh she's just a teenager.'", "Thats crazy. 17 year old is old enough to understand actions have consequences fuck them kids", "Who in their right mind would want to have a long term relationship with someone that doesnt even tell their real age to their SO. Op should break up with her who cares if she has no where to go thats her problem", "Hard agree with this. \n\nTeenager shouldn\u2019t be making off handed jokes about someone being \u201ccreepy.\u201d But OP is an adult and handled this whole thing like a child who doesn\u2019t know how to communicate properly. \n\nHe sounds like a terrible partner who shirked out of responsibility as soon as it suited him. He also didn\u2019t bother to communicate with his own partner to let her know that he wouldn\u2019t be picking up her daughter. He knew she couldn\u2019t drive but seemed to throw that back in her face, despite the fact that he left her no choice. \n\nAnd when she gets upset that he dodged his responsibility over hurt feelings, he throws in her face the bad choice she made to loose her license. \n\nHe sounds like a real catch.", "Good for him. No one wants to date someone that doesnt even tell you their age lmaoo", "Im surprised people actually think like you. What a bunch of morons", "She isn't your daughter. She was direspectful.", "Amy sounds like she\u2019s quite immature as well", "It tells me that she\u2019s probably pushing 50 or past it, which is fine, it\u2019s just weird to lie about it.", "True, but you can\u2019t expect Amy and Jess not to be upset about it.  Part of being a caregiver (whether verbally specified or not) is being there for the kids even when they are jerks. OP should have made mom come with.  If he honestly \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be alone with someone calling him a creeper\u201d then the relationship is over. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect to never be alone with Amy again", "That seems like another overreaction. Daughter was clearly wrong and they to discuss that but you can't seriously argue that in judging whether OP was reasonable what OP did is \"besides the point\" can you?!", "Yeah, but it doesn't hurt to remind them, or to tell them when they've hurt someone's feelings! Plenty of adults make the same mistake, but good communication hps in this situation.", "Reddit needs to make up its mind on how responsible teenagers are. \n\nI think her comment was rude but it sounded like a joke.", "No one better is gonna want someone that doesnt even tell their real age. Also the bonus is an immature brat whos gonna be an adult in a year. No one good will ever settle for toxic family like that. So amy should prepare to be a single parent for life", "It just makes me wonder about the longevity of the relationship. If you were serious about staying with someone indefinitely they would need to know your birthdate at some point.", "I'm gonna say no on this one. An underage teenage girl calling her live in step father 'creepy.' Is a massive liability for men. There needs to be a full conversation about how she speaks to her friends and how she paints her home life. It's perfectly reasonable to be uncomfortable and if her joking ever perked a teachers ear then it could be a really big deal. This is past the point of 'my kid is being an asshole'.", "> It's unreasonable to expect to never be alone with Amy again \n\nI think you mean Jess, not Amy, assuming you meant that it's unreasonable to expect for OP to never be alone with the daughter again?", "The partner was right to react the way she did with the information she had at the time. It doesn\u2019t look like he had told her what happened, so all she sees is her partner being an inconsiderate flake. He was supposed to drop off and pick up her minor daughter, but randomly decides not to go, is flippant about her finding alternate arrangements, then when she feels compelled to pick her daughter up hits a sore spot, when she expresses how unhappy she is (to the point that she literally feels stuck with OP) OP just says lolz you problem.", "OP doing what he need to to keep himself safe and away from accusations, even if that wasn't his conscious thought, is absolutely not an overreaction.\n\nThe kid is 17. She has friends she jokes about \"creepy stepdads\" with. Any of them could have given her a ride home in a pinch.\n\nShe ran her mouth, she deals with the consequences.", "Fr. They think being a minor should give them a free pass to being an a-hole \u201coH buT theYre JuSt a MinOr\u201d do they think teenagers somehow become a nice person after hitting 18? These people think like some oompa loompas", "OP didn't mention talking about a ride back.\n\nThe partner literally asked him to drive while under the influence (or above the legal amount) and chose to dash to pick her up herself - without a license. That 17 year old could walk back, order an Uber, or get a ride from her friends.\n\nI think the partner over reacted, and when she spat the saying - OP was reacting to it with the same tone.", "A relationship takes more than one person. She stepped out of that line. Good chance (even after a year) they don't know each other that well, or she doesn't care to treat OP better."]}
