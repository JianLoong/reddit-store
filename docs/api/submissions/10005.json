She has a 17-year-old daughter I'll call Jess.\n\nOver the weekend, Jess had a school event and had asked me for a ride in advance. I didn't mind in the slightest. I drove her over to the school and we had a nice chat in the car. When she got out though, a bunch of her friends were there, and she waved to me and shouted \"Later creepy stepdad!\" with a huge smile. I think it was a joke to her friends? They laughed and I stared awkwardly for a few seconds. Then Jess said \"Go, go!\" literally shooing me away.\n\nI drove home thinking whatever, but over time it started to really grate on me. I know that she wanted to just show off for them, but I didn't want to be stuck in a car with a girl who considered me creepy in any way. I shot her a text around that time that she would have to find another way to get home.\n\nShe didn't see my text for some time, but a few hours later she called me asking for a ride. I told her that I couldn't do that as I had had a couple of drinks (which was true). Then she half hung up on me and apparently called her mother.\n\nAmy was busy working on something at the time, and told me that I needed to get over there and pick her up. I responded that she could walk, get a ride from her friends, or take public transportation. It was 8pm in one of the safest cities in our country and that she was going to be fine. Amy then walked away, grabbed my keys, and drove off in my car, despite having a suspended license.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later Amy came home and shrieked at me about my treatment of Jess while Jess evacuated to her room. I told her that she really shouldn't be driving without a suspended license, and Amy said she wouldn't have to if I were more responsible. When I reminded her of why her license was suspended she got furious (it's a pretty touchy subject) and told me she'd leave if she had anywhere else to go. I brushed her off with a lame \"that sounds like a you problem\" and we haven't talked since.\n\nWas I being an asshole here?", "created_utc": 1676451311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112tldu/aita_for_not_picking_my_girlfriends_daughter_up/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As you say, your gfs daughter was probably showing off and joking, the fact her friends laughed suggests they took it light heartedly. But yes, I can understand how it would upset you, and it was an ah thing to say. However, I'm saying y t a as well, because you threw a tantrum rather than simply talk to her. You could have discussed how hurt you were by her comment, and how, whilst her friends may know she was joking, onlookers might not have, and it could have hurt your reputation and standing. Gf is also ah for driving with a suspended licence, rather than going for other options such as making her catch a bus (if there was one) or using a taxi.", "Info: what did Amy have to say about her daughter calling you a creepy stepdad?", "NTA\nCalling you creepy stepdad is not an appropriate way for a 17 year old to say thank you for a ride. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t pick her up either and would continue to refuse to carry her until I receive an apology for that insulting \u201cjoke\u201d.\n\nAmy sounds like she\u2019s quite immature as well", "ESH\n\n17 YO step daughters comments were unnecessary but she's a teenager they fuck up sometimes.\n\nYour reaction was a massive over reaction. You still pick her up then discuss it when she gets home.\n\nGF driving without a licence is silly (it means no insurance even if you don't get stopped). I'm not sure how far away she was and what public transport options there were but she could have sorted a taxi or something instead.\n\nInfo: how far away was the daughter to drive, by public transport, and to walk?", "ESH - why are you dating someone who wouldn\u2019t tell you their actual age?! That is such basic info. What else is she not telling you? That is so weird.\n\nShowing off in front of friends by being shitty to someone else is not cool or acceptable in any way. \n\nIf you already told her you will give her a ride, you shouldn\u2019t have left her stranded. Be the bigger person, kill them with kindness and so on\u2026", "YTA - the correct response is to raise that behaviour with her mother (your partner) straight away, and then work out away forward from there together. Whilst it\u2019s easy to take the \u201cplay stupid games, win stupid prizes\u201d route, if you want to be a long-term part of their lives, you need to take the moral high-ground. Maybe Amy could have ridden with you to collect Jess, and then afterwards you talk it through with Jess and then you decide maybe not to give her rides any more. But don\u2019t abandon a minor and if you want to build a family, then make it a teachable moment.", "YTA\n\nYou left a minor when you had pre-agreed responsibility for her. Sending her a text does not absolve you of blame or responsibility, regardless of whether or not she read it.\n\nYes, she's nearly an adult but, right now, it's on you.\n\nYes, she upset you, so you talk to her afterwards and warn her that if it happens again you won't give her rides anywhere.\n\nAt worst, you should have updated her mum and ask her to sort out alternative collection (maybe by a family member) before you had a drink and clocked out.", "YTA\n\nWOW.\n\nAt every opportunity you made the worst possible decision.\n\nWas Jess obnoxious and out of line? Yup. But guess what? She's the kid and you're the grown-up.\n\nYou responded in a petty, vindictive, sulky fashion. You had made a commitment to picking her up. You know her mom couldn't do so on a suspended license. Changing the game plan while the day's plans were in-progress, all because you were rightfully offended, was wrong. \n\nIn other words, you made yourself wrong by the way that you handle this.\n\nAnd the way you handle the argument with your girlfriend was pretty awful. Again, you were petty and vindictive. Bringing up something that you *know* is hurtful should be an obvious thing to avoid in a relationship with someone you claim to love.\n\nAnd your parting shot? \"Sounds like a you problem?\" C'mon, man. Do you really have to get the last word in, and does it have to be so petty and deliberately phrased to demonstrate how little you care for her feelings?", "YTA. \n\nYou made a commitment to your girlfriends daughter and then decided last minute not to keep that commitment because you got butt hurt and weren\u2019t mature enough to 1) keep your commitment given it was just hours away and not super reasonable to find an alternative and 2) to sit down and have a conversation about it. Plus the whole drinking thing to \u201cmake sure\u201d you couldn\u2019t be held to your word. \n\nGrow up already.", "YTA do you know how teenagers show affection? Ribbing and joking. Literally the best of friends roast the absolute hell out of each other because teenage years are a weird time for emotional vulnerability and especially with you you've only been in her life a year she may not feel comfortable getting sappy with you yet.  She said it with a smile and the fact that she was willing to refer to you as \"step-dad\" even jokingly  and come to you for a ride means she sees you as a potential father figure and was messing around with you to show her affection then you got butt hurt and didn't keep an arrangement you had made because of it. You could've called her and voiced your concerns, you could've talked about them after you picked her up instead of leaving her stranded or at the very least not drank in case she needed you for an emergency. Teenagers make dumb choices but their safety comes above all else, punishment and talks can come later. I don't care how \"safe\" the city is a 17 year old girl should not be walking or on public transport alone at night. What if something happened to her? Would your pettiness be worth it then? If you care about this woman, you should care about her daughter and be a responsible adult instead of getting your feelings hurt by a child.", "Yta\n\nCorrect reply would be to come in with car \"hey bratty teen jump in\"\nDone", "You were offended by Jess\u2019s comment, and so decided she could go find another ride.  In so doing, you put yourself in the place of a parent, making decisions for Amy, who had trusted you would handle this transportation problem. You did it without letting Amy know. \n\nAmy\u2019s experience is her boyfriend was offended at something her teenage daughter said, and so decided to strand her daughter at an event, forcing her to choose between making her walk home (clearly an unacceptable parenting choice to Amy, whatever you may think), and driving on a suspended license (something she clearly didn\u2019t want or plan to do). As a parent, she chose the later, and you can debate that parenting choice with her if you wish. When she returned from dealing with the hard choice you put her in, you brushed off her experience by saying \u201cyour problems, even if I cause them, aren\u2019t my problems\u201d. That\u2019s something you say to someone you don\u2019t want to be friends with, not someone who you want to be your partner. \n\nFor overstepping your bounds and putting yourself in the place of the parent, and deeply disrespecting your partner, the parent, YTA. \n\nOther things you could have done include: Telling Amy about the situation as soon as it happened, and letting her decide how to handle it (even if you still tell her \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable driving Jess around any more\u201d). Or telling her then and there that that kind of language was disrespectful and unacceptable to you, and that if she wanted a ride back home, it was happening now, not after her activity.", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\ni think you just broke up with her.  you literally just put her daughter in danger because your feeling got hurt by a teenager.  they are teenagers.  it was expected.  all you had to do was talk to her like an ADULT afterward.  if she refused, then that is when you can be a baby and lash out.", "ESH\n\nYou stuck because you're an adult and instead of retaliating, you should have just spoken with her immediately when she did what she did, when you felt it, or after she got home \n\nThe 17 year old sucks because she's disrespectful. I don't care of you're trying to act chill on front of your friends, you stop that or she needs to get shut down quick. \n\nMom sucks because driving without a license and taking your keys and shouting her anger out at you. \n\nY'all all need counseling and coaching on how to better communicate. Raise your emotional intelligence as well.", "Ouch.  Yup, YTA.  17 year old girls stay dumb stuff for dumb reasons.  I interpreted her comment \u201clater, creepy step dad!\u201d as a funny goodbye, meaning the exact opposite.  That she didn\u2019t consider you creepy.  She probably expected you to smile and say \u201cLater!\u201d And drive off.  \n\nBut you overthought it and decided to not pick her up.  From the post it appears that you were expected to pick her up from the beginning.  Then it disintegrated into an ESH event.\n\nIf you want to salvage these relationships, go to your girlfriend and her daughter, and apologize.  Tell the daughter that you know she meant to be humorous and you just didn\u2019t get it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
