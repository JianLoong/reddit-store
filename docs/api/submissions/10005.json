She has a 17-year-old daughter I'll call Jess.\n\nOver the weekend, Jess had a school event and had asked me for a ride in advance. I didn't mind in the slightest. I drove her over to the school and we had a nice chat in the car. When she got out though, a bunch of her friends were there, and she waved to me and shouted \"Later creepy stepdad!\" with a huge smile. I think it was a joke to her friends? They laughed and I stared awkwardly for a few seconds. Then Jess said \"Go, go!\" literally shooing me away.\n\nI drove home thinking whatever, but over time it started to really grate on me. I know that she wanted to just show off for them, but I didn't want to be stuck in a car with a girl who considered me creepy in any way. I shot her a text around that time that she would have to find another way to get home.\n\nShe didn't see my text for some time, but a few hours later she called me asking for a ride. I told her that I couldn't do that as I had had a couple of drinks (which was true). Then she half hung up on me and apparently called her mother.\n\nAmy was busy working on something at the time, and told me that I needed to get over there and pick her up. I responded that she could walk, get a ride from her friends, or take public transportation. It was 8pm in one of the safest cities in our country and that she was going to be fine. Amy then walked away, grabbed my keys, and drove off in my car, despite having a suspended license.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later Amy came home and shrieked at me about my treatment of Jess while Jess evacuated to her room. I told her that she really shouldn't be driving without a suspended license, and Amy said she wouldn't have to if I were more responsible. When I reminded her of why her license was suspended she got furious (it's a pretty touchy subject) and told me she'd leave if she had anywhere else to go. I brushed her off with a lame \"that sounds like a you problem\" and we haven't talked since.\n\nWas I being an asshole here?", "created_utc": 1676451311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112tldu/aita_for_not_picking_my_girlfriends_daughter_up/", "score": 915, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Literally the best of friends roast the absolute hell out of each other because teenage years are a weird time for emotional vulnerability and especially with you you've only been in her life a year she may not feel comfortable getting sappy with you yet.  She said it with a smile and the fact that she was willing to refer to you as \"step-dad\" even jokingly  and come to you for a ride means she sees you as a potential father figure and was messing around with you to show her affection then you got butt hurt and didn't keep an arrangement you had made because of it. You could've called her and voiced your concerns, you could've talked about them after you picked her up instead of leaving her stranded or at the very least not drank in case she needed you for an emergency. Teenagers make dumb choices but their safety comes above all else, punishment and talks can come later. I don't care how \"safe\" the city is a 17 year old girl should not be walking or on public transport alone at night. What if something happened to her? Would your pettiness be worth it then?

As a parent, she chose the later, and you can debate that parenting choice with her if you wish. When she returned from dealing with the hard choice you put her in, you brushed off her experience by saying \u201cyour problems, even if I cause them, aren\u2019t my problems\u201d.

I don't care if you're trying to act chill in front of your friends. You stop that, or she needs to get shut down quickly. \n\nMom sucks because driving without a license and taking your keys and shouting her anger out at you. \n\nY'all all need counseling and coaching on how to better communicate. Raise your emotional intelligence as well. And for the love of all, the only one acting their age is the 17 year old but everyone needs some maturing.", "Ouch.

From the post it appears that you were expected to pick her up from the beginning.

If he had told her before they left that\u2019s be different, they could make round-trip plans or stay home but he didn\u2019t. \n\nHe texted her instead of calling, knowing that texts aren\u2019t always read right away and it doesn\u2019t sound as if he told Amy he wouldn\u2019t be going to get Jess, allowing them to plan ahead. He also knows Amy has a suspended license. \n\nHe didn\u2019t just not give her a ride home, he intentionally did everything he could to leave her stranded and scrambling.", "He said he sent her a text while she was at an event. It's 100% plausible that she wasn't able to see the message when it was sent. As a parent/step parent, there's still an obligation to the child to take care of them. If my wife left my kid stranded in a town late at night I'd be furious too.", "But if he\u2019d already agreed to pick her up, before the creepy stepdad comment, then he rescinded that at the very last minute.

This is not an accusation I would deal with at all in this stage of the relationship.", "Yeah I wouldn't get in the car with a child that called me creepy.

Come on, now. Her accusation was SERIOUS and public. I don't blame him one bit. Actions have consequences. He warned her to get another ride hours before she needed one.\n\nEdit to add: another commenter made a great point, I would have told her mother right away that she needed to help her daughter find a way home.

They don't talk on the phone. It's all Text Text Text. He did fine. Not his fault she didn't check her phone, or more likely she did, just chose to ignore his text. Plus he couldn't have told her prior as he was stunned. He was thrown a curveball, and wasn't able to react immediately. I totally get that. It's all on the teen.

She is not owed any favours from him if she is making these kind of baseless borderline dangerous accusations about him.", "She had hours of knowing, there was no last minute. He texted her soon after she made that comment. Plans change and there are consequences to actions she's 17, not 12, he gave her ample warning. By your logic, people should follow through with rides to others no matter the circumstances. With her little comment, trying to impress her friends, she just ruined his entire reputation. That is not ok and her mother needs to have a serious conversation with her, which is disappointing since she is practically an adult.", "Context matters : she has means to come home, she\u2019s in a safe city, walkable distance, public transport.

What I'm wondering is why Op didn't have the mother go with him to pick up the girl that covers everything. And he could have explained to the mother why she needed to go with him so that she is aware of what step daughter has said. I might be missing something, but if the mom could grab the keys and go pick up the daughter she could have certainly ridden with him. And all three of them need to have a talk together about this - who knows what else she said even if she's joking around or trying to fit in.", "I agree with this.", "I don\u2019t think women realize how insulting that is to a man when a younger women says that to you, especially when it was unwarranted.

There are numerous safe options. I wouldn't expect her to walk. But why should I put myself at risk being alone with someone who had already called me a creep in publicif I were in OP's place?

They laughed and I stared awkwardly for a few seconds.
