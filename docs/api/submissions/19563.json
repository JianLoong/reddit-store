We sent out wedding invites for out wedding in August in January and have not received RSVP's from everyone. We are going to have a big wedding, and invited around 300 guests, but only received a response from about 80 people. My side of the wedding have all RSVP'ed, we are just waiting on my fiance's side, which is considerably larger. My fiance's parents agreed to pay for our wedding venue and her dress. The caterer was asking for a final headcount last week, and my fiance said that her side are just slow at responding and will get around to it. I told her I was upset how dismissive she was over this especially since she knows I am big on planning, and like being prepared, and not having a final headcount was really stressing me out. My fiance wanted to just tell the caterer that all her guests will be turning up, but I disagreed as catering is expensive, and will be wasteful if some of her side don't make it to the wedding. I asked her to give me a final number but she didn't do anything and told me not to worry and just tell the caterer that all her guests are coming, so I messaged the people who hadn't RSVP'ed, so sorry to here you won't be able to make it, and I instantly got a response of who was able to and who couldn't within 24 hours. Also, the deadline on the invite was last month. I submitted the final number to the caterer, and when my fiance found out what I did, she blew up on me, and said it looked like I was uninviting her side of the family. Her parents are upset, and are refusing to give us the venue on the wedding date if I don't apologise. I am paying for catering, and I have previosuly tried to follow up on the invite after the deadline, this was my final way of contacting them.", "created_utc": 1686514501, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14741ts/aita_for_sending_sorry_to_hear_you_wont_be_able/", "score": 146, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's rude AF not to RSVP by the deadline date to an event that costs as much in catering as a wedding. I do think you were being a bit overbearing, but I understand the stress and anxiety of planning and how it's annoying to try and plan around people who are rude and uncommunicative. I would have said they don't get to eat if they don't RSVP, but your solution was funny, too. Plus, it did the trick. Lol", "NTA. You made your concerns very clear and had a deadline for RSVP in place. You gave a final message for people to state their intentions (maybe the wording could have been better but it got the job done). Who was paying for the caterer?\n\nEdit:\nSince you are paying for catering absolutely NTA. Maybe sit down with your future wife and discuss your concerns about your voice not being taken seriously and her lack of concern.", "NTA. Don't apologize.  Cancel the wedding.  This is the start of a pattern of behaviors that will drive both you and her crazy.", "Uh your rsvp deadline is three months before the wedding? Is that correct?", "NTA. They put you in an impossible position.\n\n>We sent out wedding invites for out wedding in August in January and have not received RSVP's from everyone.\n\nThis is absurd.\n\n>my fiance said that her side are just slow at responding and will get around to it.\n\nWhen? This is no way to behave. What were you supposed to do?", "ESH\n\nBut you\u2019re the bigger asshole for acting unilaterally behind your fianc\u00e9es back.\n\nIf you two are this incapable of communication and compromise, catering is the least of what you should be worried about.", "NTA. It\u2019s rude as hell to not rsvp by the date, let alone a whole month afterwards. It\u2019s not just about the cost of catering, if you\u2019re planning and event for a certain number of people and a bunch don\u2019t show up then it can mess with a lot of other things including your mood. Who wants to have a bunch of empty chairs at their wedding? Also to all the folks saying you could have just texted them to follow up, it\u2019s not your responsibility. It\u2019s your furnace\u2019s family and you spoke to her about it multiplies times before that. Tbh neither of you should really have to chase up a respond for your wedding, but your firm e has ample opportunity to send the message to her family herself. Also, it doesn\u2019t sound like you told the ones who finally did respond to tell you that they would be coming that it was too late for them. I would probably give a non-apology just to settle the peace, something like \u2018oh sorry about the text, we didn\u2019t hear from you by the rsvp date and I just wanted you to know that even though you couldn\u2019t make it you would be missed\u2019", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t apologize until her or her family members can explain how it\u2019s ok for these people to flat out ignore you even after you reached out to them multiple times\n\nFor everyone voting YTA or ESH, a 300 person wedding is utterly massive these days.

In hindsight, maybe it would have been better to just message all those people and ask if they'd be coming rather than assume they aren't but it's nonetheless very inconsiderate for people to not respond knowing the logistical nightmare that weddings can often be. I think it is still best to apologize but you still need to fully explain things from your point of view.", "INFO: Is there a cultural difference between your two families?\n\nSome cultures I'm familiar with assume almost no one will RSVP, so they serve food banquet style, order enough food for everyone who was invited plus extra, and have the venue put out enough tables and chairs that everyone should be able to find a seat.", "NTA \n\nThe deadline to RSVP had already passed and the caterer needed final numbers so that they can plan and prepare the correct amount of food. You got the correct numbers which is what is important.", "ESH. You had a way of contacting all of them, could have just done a nice little check-in \u201cHey, we never got an RSVP from you. Are you able to make it? We need to submit numbers for catering today.\u201d or something along those lines, but instead you chose the petty route. These people had not RSVP\u2019d yes OR no, yet you chose to message them passive aggressively as if they had said no. I get being frustrated, but you chose to message them a snarky message.

Follow ups are a normal (annoying) part of wedding planning.\n\nBut you could have also taken that on instead of your approach. Your solution sucked. I hope you guys can grow together and learn to communicate better.", "ESH. Your fiance is at fault for not managing her guests' RSVPs better, but you are also at fault for unilaterally emailing her guests without informing her first. You could have said, \"Please reach out to your friends and family because I will be submitting the final headcount to the caterers by X date, and at that time I will only be submitting the number of people who have RSVPed.\" \n\nINFO: I am curious as to what percentage of the people you emailed said Yes to attending vs. No - if most people said Yes than she was right that people were planning to come and were just slow to respond, if most people said No then you were right that including those people in the catering count would have been a waste of money. \n\nEither way, it probably doesn't hurt to apologize to her parents to smooth things over. I wouldn't apolgize to the wedding guests that you emailed though - if they were late RSVPing then they deserve to risk being uninvited.", "ESH. \nOP are you both from the same culture?

I get that you are a big planner, so am I and so I totally get the anxiety but why wouldn\u2019t you even tell her that you were going to reach out to her side of the family? It\u2019s her family and guests after all. I get why she\u2019s upset and why her parents are upset. You went over them and in some cultures being this pushy is considered extremely rude.

At $40 a plate, which is what Alexa tells me is the average cost of a wedding meal in the USA, you could be potentially throwing away $8,800! \n\nSo, the fiance's family is incredibly rude and she feels that he owes them an apology.

No need to be rude to me here and act as if I\u2019m some immovably opinionated person. Humans disagree, and I don\u2019t have this overwhelming desire to convince everyone I\u2019m right.

They have some values which may not align with his values or needs.\n\nHe is worried not about them not showing up, but, \"the cost\".  So, he spites his entire fiance's family after being explicitly told not to do so to save costs, which ends up not only costing him his fiance's respect and trust, but the finances he is trying to save because now the family he spited no longer wants to pay for shit.\n\nAnd for what, because of a deadline?  \n\nSo the outcome is he gets to feel like his deadline was met, and it has cost him likely more money(allegedly his whole goal), and potentially ruin the relationship he has with his fiance, his relationship with her family, and strain his fiance's relationship with her family.  And he gets.... what out of this decision?  The ability to feel like his deadline and rules were followed?\n\nIf a deadline is passed and more than 50% of the guests haven't met it, a significantly more reasonable thing would be to follow up with them, or give a final grace period. Instead he's burning over 100 bridges and tanking his marriage.\n\nAnd you're like \"yaaaaas queen ruin your marriage before it starts, deadlines are so much more important than relationships!  Spend extra money covering the costs of the venue to save money on catering!\"\n\nAt that point skip the marriage, and save all the money", "Honestly, SHE ruined this marriage here. OP hasn't done anything wrong. Her entire family is the people doing something wrong. How about her family pay for the catering if it's so not important to respond if you are coming or not. Why the fuck should OP spend cash unnecessarily when he doesn't have a clue who is or isn't coming. Her family can pay for the food that is leftover in that case.\n\nHer entire family are disrespectful rude fucks, OP isn't an asshole for dealing with them the way they deserve to be dealt with.", ">How about her family pay for the catering\n\nThey're already paying quite a bit.  Sometimes ya gotta take it on the chin when you're getting the royal treatment elsewhere\n\n>Why the fuck should OP spend cash unnecessarily\n\nBecause what he's doing will make him spend significantly more money.  Tripping over dollars to pick-up pennies", "No, you shouldn't. I wouldn't want to marry into this family considering their behavior. If they dont want to pay anymore, then the choice is simple, don't marry her, considering how rude she is i would probably already have called off the wedding."]}
