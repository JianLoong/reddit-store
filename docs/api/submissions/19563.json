We sent out wedding invites for out wedding in August in January and have not received RSVP's from everyone.

My side of the wedding have all RSVP'ed, we are just waiting on my fiance's side, which is considerably larger. My fiance's parents agreed to pay for our wedding venue and her dress. The caterer was asking for a final headcount last week, and my fiance said that her side are just slow at responding and will get around to it. I told her I was upset how dismissive she was over this especially since she knows I am big on planning, and like being prepared, and not having a final headcount was really stressing me out. My fiance wanted to just tell the caterer that all her guests will be turning up, but I disagreed as catering is expensive, and will be wasteful if some of her side don't make it to the wedding. I asked her to give me a final number but she didn't do anything and told me not to worry and just tell the caterer that all her guests are coming, so I messaged the people who hadn't RSVP'ed, so sorry to here you won't be able to make it, and I instantly got a response of who was able to and who couldn't within 24 hours. Also, the deadline on the invite was last month. I submitted the final number to the caterer, and when my fiance found out what I did, she blew up on me, and said it looked like I was uninviting her side of the family.

It's rude AF not to RSVP by the deadline date to an event that costs as much in catering as a wedding. I do think you were being a bit overbearing, but I understand the stress and anxiety of planning and how it's annoying to try and plan around people who are rude and uncommunicative. I would have said they don't get to eat if they don't RSVP, but your solution was funny, too. Plus, it did the trick. Lol", "NTA. You made your concerns very clear and had a deadline for RSVP in place. You gave a final message for people to state their intentions (maybe the wording could have been better but it got the job done). Who was paying for the caterer?\n\nEdit:\nSince you are paying for catering absolutely NTA. Maybe sit down with your future wife and discuss your concerns about your voice not being taken seriously and her lack of concern.", "NTA. Don't apologize.  Cancel the wedding.  This is the start of a pattern of behaviors that will drive both you and her crazy.", "Uh your rsvp deadline is three months before the wedding? Is that correct?", "NTA. They put you in an impossible position.\n\n>We sent out wedding invites for out wedding in August in January and have not received RSVP's from everyone.\n\nThis is absurd.\n\n>my fiance said that her side are just slow at responding and will get around to it.\n\nWhen?

What were you supposed to do?", "ESH\n\nBut you\u2019re the bigger asshole for acting unilaterally behind your fianc\u00e9es back.\n\nIf you two are this incapable of communication and compromise, catering is the least of what you should be worried about.", "NTA. It\u2019s rude as hell to not rsvp by the date, let alone a whole month afterwards. It\u2019s not just about the cost of catering, if you\u2019re planning and event for a certain number of people and a bunch don\u2019t show up then it can mess with a lot of other things including your mood. Who wants to have a bunch of empty chairs at their wedding? Also to all the folks saying you could have just texted them to follow up, it\u2019s not your responsibility. It\u2019s your furnace\u2019s family and you spoke to her about it multiplies times before that. Tbh neither of you should really have to chase up a respond for your wedding, but your firm e has ample opportunity to send the message to her family herself. Also, it doesn\u2019t sound like you told the ones who finally did respond to tell you that they would be coming that it was too late for them. I would probably give a non-apology just to settle the peace, something like \u2018oh sorry about the text, we didn\u2019t hear from you by the rsvp date and I just wanted you to know that even though you couldn\u2019t make it you would be missed\u2019", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t apologize until her or her family members can explain how it\u2019s ok for these people to flat out ignore you even after you reached out to them multiple times\n\nFor everyone voting YTA or ESH, a 300 person wedding is utterly massive these days.

Follow ups are a normal (annoying) part of wedding planning.\n\nBut you could have also taken that on instead of your approach. Your solution sucked. I hope you guys can grow together and learn to communicate better.", "ESH. Your fiance is at fault for not managing her guests' RSVPs better, but you are also at fault for unilaterally emailing her guests without informing her first. You could have said, \"Please reach out to your friends and family because I will be submitting the final headcount to the caterers by X date, and at that time I will only be submitting the number of people who have RSVPed.\" \n\nINFO: I am curious as to what percentage of the people you emailed said Yes to attending vs. No - if most people said Yes than she was right that people were planning to come and were just slow to respond, if most people said No then you were right that including those people in the catering count would have been a waste of money. \n\nEither way, it probably doesn't hurt to apologize to her parents to smooth things over. I wouldn't apolgize to the wedding guests that you emailed though - if they were late RSVPing then they deserve to risk being uninvited.", "ESH. \nOP are you both from the same culture?

I get that you are a big planner, so am I and so I totally get the anxiety but why wouldn\u2019t you even tell her that you were going to reach out to her side of the family? It\u2019s her family and guests after all. I get why she\u2019s upset and why her parents are upset. You went over them and in some cultures being this pushy is considered extremely rude.

They have some values which may not align with his values or needs.\n\nHe is worried not about them not showing up, but, \"the cost\".

And he gets.... what out of this decision?  The ability to feel like his deadline and rules were followed?\n\nIf a deadline is passed and more than 50% of the guests haven't met it, a significantly more reasonable thing would be to follow up with them, or give a final grace period.

It\u2019s almost mid June and they want to plan a huge wedding by August; they should have a better idea of a headcount by now.

Most of the points you raised were already addressed in the OP. They had a final notice already, it was a month past the RSVP deadline, the guy is paying for the catering (which can easily be the most expensive thing for any wedding), and the caterer needed a final headcount because it's wedding season and they're probably busy. They had time to respond. They fucked around for MONTHS including a month past the deadline after a final notice. They had the polite reminder in the past, they deserved the, \"Sorry you couldn't make it,\" snark they got. They missed out. Their inaction is a \"No\". Tough shit. It's suspicious that they cared enough to immediately respond when they were shown the door. Why couldn't they do that earlier? Oh. I know. Because now they might miss out on a free meal.\n\nInstead of blaming him in part for this all the blame should go to her family for not being prudent for a wedding and her for kowtowing to them. You don't do this kind of shit to people. Weddings are already tremendously stressful with the clothing, venues, transportation, catering, DJ, and on and on. Not having a final headcount of people that might or might not show up puts you on the hook for potentially hundreds to thousands of dollars in wasted food.\n\nAlso for people going \"wHy Is ThErE aN rSvP iN tHe FiRsT pLaCe?\" Because it's 300 people. When you plan for 300 people you need to know who's showing up. You don't just plate 300 meals and then 160 people show up. Also why this early? Because some people like to plan things out and be prepared. How many stories have you seen of weddings losing venues and stuff like that?

Catering is often the most expensive part of a wedding.", "No but ...last month for an August wedding seems super early to have your RSVPs in?", "Apparently he was supposed to assume they were coming and just pay for food they might not eat", "I would add in communication patterns", "He did straight up demand an answer -- when he put the \"RSVP by\" date on the invitation.  No one should need a further reminder, or to be asked twice.", "He did that, via the RSVPs with a RSVP by date. What clearer boundaries could there be?\n\nhe also demanded and answer from his fiance as well -\n\n>I asked her to give me a final number but she didn't do anything and told me not to worry and just tell the caterer that all her guests are coming", "very poetic", "This is what I am confused about too. Sending invites that far out is bananas", "ESH.\n\nThis is what I was thinking. Send out a \"save the date\" in January and follow up with invitations in May or June. I checked and it's actually poor etiquette to send out invitations so far in advance for the very reason that folks forget it altogether.\n\nThe guests may have shown poor etiquette in not RSVP'ing in time, but proper etiquette for OP would have been to send out save the dates first with 8 months until the wedding date.", "I require full payment 30 days out. So I normally need a slice count 45 days out the latest. Normally I get one 60 days out. If you don't have your head count by then, you are going to have a lot of problems getting what you need in my area.  If they don't pay in full by 30 days prior, no cake.", "Alexa is way under budget on this one, unless you are catering bbq or fried chicken.", "The bride's parents are \"giving them\" a venue he said, but OP is paying for the catering, which is the big expense. The bride's family is refusing to give them the venue if he doesn't apologize for what he did.", "Thank you! I'm a caterer. I was gonna stay quite cause I was afraid of the hive mind...but over a month lead time? That is wild.", "Even for 300 people?", "They invited 300 people i can't really blame the caterer for wanting it sooner", "Everything else is still motion so the meaning is that because life is going forward, progressing, you therefore fall backwards by being stagnant.", "Relative to other people you are?!", "Read the whole damn post, literally the last line \n\n>and I have previosuly tried to follow up on the invite after the deadline, this was my final way of contacting them.", "But he has tried to reach out before and they ignored him\u2026", "He did send a less snarky message that was ignored. He says so in the story. The \"snarky\" message was after being ignored", "Because in some cultures it is assumed that your close family will drop everything and be there. If they won\u2019t they call you and apologize ahead of time. If you are invited it\u2019s expected you will show up.", "Especially if they have to make travel plans to get to you.", "The more I read these comments, the more I agree with this as the answer.", "\"and I have previosuly tried to follow up on the invite after the deadline, this was my final way of contacting them\"", "Yeah, but even if they added the 10% to the headcount of 80 guests that they were currently at, they for sure would\u2019ve ran into issues with too many guests and not enough food. The OP said that the fianc\u00e9\u2019s family would be a much larger portion of the guest list, and having only 80 out of 300 possible RSVP\u2019s and knowing that a good amount of her family would probably still show up to the wedding unaccounted for, 10% overage just isn\u2019t going to cut it, lol. I see where your head is at, but having about 73% of the total possible guests not RSVP\u2019ed, is way too much for any caterer to compensate for without a more accurate headcount. Lesson here is, just freakin\u2019 RSVP so you\u2019re NTA who is starving at a wedding, lol", "Holy carp!!", "Not really, caterers often need to know pretty well in advance. Additionally most people know their schedule for a wedding 3 months out. It's not like it's a Halloween party or something.", "Maybe. But explain why ALL of his side replied but NONE of hers did?", "Caterers are literally asking for final numbers. How much later do you want the RSVPs to be? Wouldn't be surprised if they charged more the longer it took to get a final count.", "It's less than 2 months away", "I agree, some people won\u2019t know until closer to the day. Especially trying to lock down a babysitter 3 months in advance or being able to anticipate work things depending on the type of job you have can be hard. \n\nThat said, people could communicate that they won\u2019t be able to have an answer rather than ignoring the deadline.", "This, as well as OPs inlaws ganging up on them at the first sign of push back for any kind of communication. Marinara flags all over indeed!", "Our RSVP deadline was about 3 months before the wedding. We suspected (our suspicions were confirmed) that some wouldn't RSVP by the deadline regardless of when we set it.\n\nThe caterer asked for a head count 6 weeks prior, and then a \"final head count\" 2 weeks before the wedding.", "I had to have a final head count given to my venue (who provided the caterer) about 2 months before the wedding. / shrug", "For a wedding of 300, a couple of months is incredibly common.", "Yes. They aren\u2019t getting food deliveries or cooking two months out.", "220 close family?", "Yeah, I live in Vancouver. If you want me to turn up to your wedding in St. John's, I'm going to need a plane ticket, and those get exponentially more expensive the closer you get to the flight date.", "I\u2019ve never received a wedding invite a month and a half before the wedding. Every invite I\u2019ve received was a min of 4 months out. When you have friends and family spread out they need more than a few weeks to make travel arrangements.", "Again, where did OP say that? That isn't in the post I judged and still isn't there now.", "I'm actually really curious how many of the 220 who didn't RSVP told OP yes after he sent this message to them. Like, was it almost everyone said yes and they would have been in a *really* bad situation had he not done it or was it only a handful who said yes?", "Caterers do not need final numbers more than a couple of weeks out. They may want numbers earlier, but they don\u2019t actually need them. Soft numbers a couple of months out and hard numbers a couple of weeks out should be fine.", "Never have I been to a wedding that required more than 2 weeks notice for final numbers catering wise. So even being generous with a month still makes 3 look ridiculous. You have already given them the idea of numbers, it's just the final countm", "It would be on the early side to send the *invites* out 3 months before the date. Sending invitations 8 months in advance and expecting RSVPs 3 months in advance is so far outside the norm I\u2019m not surprised a lot of people missed the deadline!", "Rsvps shouldn't have to be in til lole a month before. Unless it's a destination wedding where the size/accommodation is limited.", "It's a wedding. It's kinda understood you need rsvp by the deadline date. You either find a way to make time or it's a no", "I was thinking more along they lines of ensuring they had enough ingredients. Just typing that out, 3 months still doesn't make sense. \ud83d\ude02", "The snark was deserved.  Not replying is an asshole move.", "When you come from a culture that treats first cousins like siblings and 2nd-5th cousins like they are first cousins, yes.", "Exactly this \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "That\u2019s what a save the date is for", "It's the last sentence", "I\u2019m curious as well, lol. I wish he had added that to the post, but I think it\u2019s probably safe to assume that a lot responded with yes, due to the backlash he\u2019s receiving from her family for sending out the messages to all of them.", "OP didn't even have soft numbers. Less than a third of guests responded in any way at all.", "If my caterer tells me they need numbers by a date, then I\u2019m going to believe them.", "My nephew recently got married and rsvp was 3 months in advance", "Just because you've been to goofy weddings doesn't make that the norm...", "You can go argue with his caterer then. I would assume they need to have head count to then plan meals but if reddit stranger disagrees, who am I to disagree?\n\nAlso, is it not up to the person inviting people to decide how much notice they need? Not you or me?", "Exactly! Caterers and food suppliers have the resources to supply food on pretty short notice.", "I think we\u2019ve received maybe one save the date between my husband and myself. We usually just get the invite.", "You don\u2019t get soft numbers from RSVPs.", "Which is ridiculous unless it involves international travel", "Lol \"goofy weddings \".\nResort to insult because you don't understand, what a hero.", "Yes but he asked if he was the AH, just because it's up to him doesn't make them not an AH.\nIn general,  wanting people to RSVP doesn't make them the AH, but I  do think this is a bit over the top.", "Not for a wedding for 300 they don't, it takes an awful lot of planning and making certain that your suppliers have the needed items in stock to be able to supply that many meals", "There are a lot of shortages of ingredients lately. I work in the wedding industry and we have been ordering out farther and farther trying to guarantee we get what we need. Especially for big weddings like this.", "The OP is paying for the catering of the wedding though, the fianc\u00e9 and her family was telling OP to just include 200 odd people as a yes without knowing how many would actually show - even if 100 of those do show that is a large chunk of money OP is shelling out in catering for no-shows.", "My venue for my wedding wants a headcount 30 days in advance. Two weeks is fine for emergencies, but a lot of places get heavily booked and need plenty of time for prep. It isn\u2019t hard to RSVP. Last couple weddings I went to asked for RSVP 60 days in advance. I asked for mine 90 days in advance because I know people aren\u2019t going to get back to me until after the deadline lol. I got all but like 4 of my RSVP\u2019s back so I\u2019ll check on them a little closer to the 30 days that my venue wants.", "goof\u00b7y  \n/\u02c8\u0261o\u035eof\u0113/  \nadjectiveINFORMAL  \n1.  \nNORTH AMERICAN  \nfoolish or harmlessly eccentric.  \n\nI'm surprised you're insulted by that lol.

The caterer needed numbers. His wife didn't disagree. His wife said just pay for 300 people. So either he pays what could easily be thousands more or he's an AH?", "How do you predict a fresh food shortage two months out? Dry goods? Ok. But you can estimate those. Any good caterer has a strong idea of how many ppl will show based on how many were invited.", "Edit: two weeks or less is fine for emergencies", "Oh no not using my personal experience! Like EVERY OTHER PERSON ON REDDIT lol", "Not to mention the potential food waste if the caterer prepares 300 meals and only 200 people show up (which is a pretty generous number itself imo - 120 more than actually RSVP\u2019d by the deadline!)"]}
