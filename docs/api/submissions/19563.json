We sent out wedding invites for out wedding in August in January and have not received RSVP's from everyone.

My side of the wedding have all RSVP'ed, we are just waiting on my fiance's side, which is considerably larger. My fiance's parents agreed to pay for our wedding venue and her dress. The caterer was asking for a final headcount last week, and my fiance said that her side are just slow at responding and will get around to it. I told her I was upset how dismissive she was over this especially since she knows I am big on planning, and like being prepared, and not having a final headcount was really stressing me out. My fiance wanted to just tell the caterer that all her guests will be turning up, but I disagreed as catering is expensive, and will be wasteful if some of her side don't make it to the wedding. I asked her to give me a final number but she didn't do anything and told me not to worry and just tell the caterer that all her guests are coming, so I messaged the people who hadn't RSVP'ed, so sorry to here you won't be able to make it, and I instantly got a response of who was able to and who couldn't within 24 hours. Also, the deadline on the invite was last month. I submitted the final number to the caterer, and when my fiance found out what I did, she blew up on me, and said it looked like I was uninviting her side of the family.

It's rude AF not to RSVP by the deadline date to an event that costs as much in catering as a wedding. I do think you were being a bit overbearing, but I understand the stress and anxiety of planning and how it's annoying to try and plan around people who are rude and uncommunicative. I would have said they don't get to eat if they don't RSVP, but your solution was funny, too. Plus, it did the trick. Lol", "NTA. You made your concerns very clear and had a deadline for RSVP in place. You gave a final message for people to state their intentions (maybe the wording could have been better but it got the job done). Who was paying for the caterer?\n\nEdit:\nSince you are paying for catering absolutely NTA. Maybe sit down with your future wife and discuss your concerns about your voice not being taken seriously and her lack of concern.", "NTA. Don't apologize.  Cancel the wedding.  This is the start of a pattern of behaviors that will drive both you and her crazy.", "Uh your rsvp deadline is three months before the wedding? Is that correct?", "NTA. They put you in an impossible position.\n\n>We sent out wedding invites for out wedding in August in January and have not received RSVP's from everyone.\n\nThis is absurd.\n\n>my fiance said that her side are just slow at responding and will get around to it.\n\nWhen?

What were you supposed to do?", "ESH\n\nBut you\u2019re the bigger asshole for acting unilaterally behind your fianc\u00e9es back.\n\nIf you two are this incapable of communication and compromise, catering is the least of what you should be worried about.", "NTA. It\u2019s rude as hell to not rsvp by the date, let alone a whole month afterwards. It\u2019s not just about the cost of catering, if you\u2019re planning and event for a certain number of people and a bunch don\u2019t show up then it can mess with a lot of other things including your mood. Who wants to have a bunch of empty chairs at their wedding? Also to all the folks saying you could have just texted them to follow up, it\u2019s not your responsibility. It\u2019s your furnace\u2019s family and you spoke to her about it multiplies times before that. Tbh neither of you should really have to chase up a respond for your wedding, but your firm e has ample opportunity to send the message to her family herself. Also, it doesn\u2019t sound like you told the ones who finally did respond to tell you that they would be coming that it was too late for them. I would probably give a non-apology just to settle the peace, something like \u2018oh sorry about the text, we didn\u2019t hear from you by the rsvp date and I just wanted you to know that even though you couldn\u2019t make it you would be missed\u2019", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t apologize until her or her family members can explain how it\u2019s ok for these people to flat out ignore you even after you reached out to them multiple times\n\nFor everyone voting YTA or ESH, a 300 person wedding is utterly massive these days.

Follow ups are a normal (annoying) part of wedding planning.\n\nBut you could have also taken that on instead of your approach. Your solution sucked. I hope you guys can grow together and learn to communicate better.", "ESH. Your fiance is at fault for not managing her guests' RSVPs better, but you are also at fault for unilaterally emailing her guests without informing her first. You could have said, \"Please reach out to your friends and family because I will be submitting the final headcount to the caterers by X date, and at that time I will only be submitting the number of people who have RSVPed.\" \n\nINFO: I am curious as to what percentage of the people you emailed said Yes to attending vs. No - if most people said Yes than she was right that people were planning to come and were just slow to respond, if most people said No then you were right that including those people in the catering count would have been a waste of money. \n\nEither way, it probably doesn't hurt to apologize to her parents to smooth things over. I wouldn't apolgize to the wedding guests that you emailed though - if they were late RSVPing then they deserve to risk being uninvited.", "ESH. \nOP are you both from the same culture?

I get that you are a big planner, so am I and so I totally get the anxiety but why wouldn\u2019t you even tell her that you were going to reach out to her side of the family? It\u2019s her family and guests after all. I get why she\u2019s upset and why her parents are upset. You went over them and in some cultures being this pushy is considered extremely rude.

They have some values which may not align with his values or needs.\n\nHe is worried not about them not showing up, but, \"the cost\".

And he gets.... what out of this decision?  The ability to feel like his deadline and rules were followed?\n\nIf a deadline is passed and more than 50% of the guests haven't met it, a significantly more reasonable thing would be to follow up with them, or give a final grace period.

OP may have been being passive aggressive, but he was also following convention and he ended up getting exactly what he needed", "Yeah if you can send your snarky comment to 220 guests why couldn\u2019t you have just sent a less snarky one? They\u2019re about to be your family, people need to control their frustration better! Everyone sucks!", "The RSVP deadline was last month, so \\~3 months prior to the wedding, not that the RSVP was expected in January.", "In America it\u2019s fairly common to send out invites that far in advance. Theoretically to give people plenty of time to prepare and plan.", "My family doesn't typically do formal weddings, and they would have found it odd to ask that far in advance. OP and his wife need to talk about family norms because that's the actual issue here.", "How do you plan an event if you don't know how many people are coming though?", "He tried but she dismissed his concerns. This will not go well.", "^exactly", "Yup. Most caterers ask for a headcount 2-4 weeks in advance of the event - not 2 months. I\u2019ve seen some that ask for a head count 1 week prior. And I\u2019ve never seen an RSVP deadline 3 months before the wedding.", "I\u2019m with you. They should\u2019ve reached out on the day of the deadline and said something nicely.", "Imagine not being able to handle a snarky message after being an asshole and not replying even a month after the deadline. Grow up.", "You have never run a large event.", "Somehow I read the comment as wanting OP to make phone calls, but on re-reading it does not in fact say that", "Sending invites in January to an August wedding is abnormal where I'm from. And expecting them 3 months before the wedding is even more abnormal. I'm perfectly open to saying it may be a cultural thing and this is normal in other settings/cultures.", "I'm going to disagree with you. Save The Dates are common that far in advance. Most US based etiquette will tell you formal invites are 3 months/12 weeks before the wedding at most with RSVP deadlines being 2-4 weeks before the date. Experience being I literally just got married like 4 months ago and dealt with this game along with 3 other friends in the same situation.", "Not true. American etiquette is six weeks.", "I still end up with a confirmed number. Most of the guests reached out to my parents or myself directly, and the ones that didn\u2019t we reached out to them to follow up.", "I agree. My judgment post said to break it off. The cost of the catering is less than a divorce.", "I know he shared his concerns with her and she dismissed him, but it sounds like he sent that text without giving her a heads up. I don\u2019t think he should have taken action without telling her what he was planning to do.", "I GOT an invite 3 months before the wedding, but if I got an invite this far out and saw the please respond by date, I would either send it back or contact the couple \"hey, need a bit more time, still finalizing plans,\" so it didn't seem like I was straight not giving a fuck, like it seems like his in laws are.", "Who here can\u2019t handle one? I\u2019m just saying I can see why his fianc\u00e9 would be upset he was snarky to her family. It\u2019s not much deeper than that bud. \u201cGrow up\u201d", "I mean, wrong, but that aside I think it\u2019s very easy to control frustration and just reach out tactfully rather than in a petty manner \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "I don't have enough personal knowledge to know whats abnormal in these situations, but I've heard of people with big events like this to have an \"early\" deadline on the first round of invites in case people say no, then they can invite other people in place of them.\n\nAlso normal or not, if you get an invite and plan to go, you would RSVP by the deadline included on said invite versus just... ignoring it. In the modern age when digital RSVPing, getting no reply defaults you to a NO in the system.", "Yes, that\u2019s very odd.", "You asked the question and I\u2019m responding with my experience. Most weddings I\u2019ve been invited to have sent invitations 6+ months out. Maybe where you are in the US is different from where I\u2019m at. Maybe there\u2019s a different culture where you\u2019re from. \n\nMy personal wedding experience is an anomaly considering my husband and I got married three months after we got engaged and we had a very small wedding. But bigger weddings, like the first one I had, require lots of prep and planning. That includes guests coming in from out of town and needing to make travel plans. \n\nMost of the time, I see save the dates sent out 9-12 months away from the date.", "That has not been my experience.", "So an RSVP?", "[removed]", "Plus when you have spendier weddings, you plan as far in advance as you can afford to.", "Exactly!"]}
