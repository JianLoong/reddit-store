In real life, when you want to solve problems, you use all the resources available to you. You do not have to have every little thing memorized to demonstrate understanding of how things work. Cheat sheet exams are more reflective of how the world works than closed-book exams, and your students are developing useful skills to help them later in life. You are not responsible for the fact that not everyone does this.", "NTA\n\nThe word \"cheat sheet\" probably set off that mother. \n\nTo be honest, I used to do something like this before I started taking my own exams. I would write out all the formulas I knew from memory. Any symbols I remembered, and I would even try to organize them. \n\nI didn't copy it from a book or print it out from the computer or bring it from home. I would just tear out the last blank page of the exam or get scratch paper and then write stuff out. \n\nMaybe relabel what you call it:  \n5 minute- Brain Storm!\n\nBecause that's what it is. They are searching their brains for relevant information and organizing it. It's a great way to get them mentally engaged and focused before they get to the first question. Sort of like a warm-up before going for a 5 mile run.", "NTA, they have nothing except for a pen and paper, there are no books around those 5 mins. I think it is a great idea!! I wished my teachers would allow this at my school.. i mean, you are trying out new ways for kids to learn. I dont see how this is a asshole move\u2026  it is just a really good method to calm the kids during a test which can lead to better grades!", "NTA - that seems like an excellent idea! Now not only are you testing them with the exam, you are training them to sort and recall important information themselves, without the prompt of a test question. That will be far more useful to them in life than their ability to take a test.\n\nI'm not sure why anyone would think this constitutes an unfair advantage - it's not as if they have access to outside materials during the test, only their own minds. Most standardized tests allow spare paper to write your own notes as needed anyhow, so if anything it's a standard testing procedure. \n\nGood on you for finding a way to reduce your students testing anxiety and better prepare them for the world ahead. We desperately need more teachers like you!", "NTA: It's brilliant. They do a little pre-exam cramming, focus their thoughts and feel like they're getting away with something.\n\nMy husband used to make cheat sheets for his exams. Took tons of time and rewrote them smaller and smaller so he could hide them easily. He never had to use them because by making them he was actually studying. I have a feeling your students will study and prep for what they want to put on their sanctioned cheat sheets.\n\nIf your admin supports you, keep at it.", "NTA. How could it be a cheat sheet when the source of the \"cheat\" is the examinees' own memory of what they studied? \ud83d\ude11 that outside parent was just being salty.", "NTA. \n\nCase of one person spoiling it for everyone else.", "NTA \n\nyou're trying to help reduce the anxiety of the students and they write what they have learned its not like they copy stuff from their text books.", "NTA, this is pretty good idea. I had many uni exam where we were allowed to have home made cheet sheet with formulas and short notes. It was pretty normal in all uni subjects where you had plenty of formulas like mathematics, physics and statistics.", "NTA\n\nIs this parent upset about open book tests too? Some teachers allow students to use the book to write everything they can on a 3x5\" card. This isn't much different than that. I say, if it works, keep it up.", "I'm going to say NTA based on your post. \n\nIn my country, you are always allowed to write stuff down on a separate piece of paper before/during the exam (without books and notes of course). Also, I don't consider this really cheating. Nobody is using anything extra that they wouldn't be allowed to use during the exam.", "NTA, I mean they have to write the sheet themselves and only from what they can remember. Of all exams starting highschool until my engineering degree you always have a piece of paper to help you during the exam and you can use it at the very beginning to write anything to make sure you don\u2019t forget, that\u2019s normal. \n\nIn the end all you write depends on what you managed to remember enough, only difference with the exam is that is not a direct answer to a question and doesn\u2019t give points in itself.", "Sounds like two people who are taking the word cheat sheet too seriously. It's like giving more time to do a test. If I wrote everything I remembered 5 min b4 a test with no help but mind, it'd feel like I'm just airing out my thoughts and then when I'm doing the test I'm just organizing my thoughts into meaningful and thought out expressions of my studies on the subject. \nYou are NTA you are an inspiration, as you show that you understand the mentality and stress sum of your students suffer from test taking. It's not cheating, it's teaching them to think differently and experience test, that they are clearly prepared for, in a less stressful manner and in turn should have them doing better in all test, even without your version of a \"cheat sheet\".", "NTA.  All they're doing on the \"cheat sheet\" is writing down what they remember, not copying stuff from the textbooks.  \n\nI had a professor in grad school who allowed us to write notes on an 8x11 sheet of paper for the final exam.  I had no margins and 3 point font, but I got everything on there.  I've seen medical doctors look up stuff on Google.  Continue the conversation with admin.", "NTA. They allow them in some university classes aswell. Parent is just looking for something to complain about.", "Nta sounds like a great idea.", "NTA.\n\nI think calling them cheat sheets is a bit misleading. In most of the exams I've taken In high school, and then later at university we were allowed to write \"working\" on the back of the book, or on a provided piece of paper for \"working out\" the answers (which is handed back in at the end of the exam). I've always brain dumped everything I remember immediately after I pick up my pen in the exam. I think it's kind of food exam practice. A great technique to teach at any rate.", "NTH. Most of the student did that in the midst of the pandemic. Much worse than that is they copy pasted thing from internet as the answer!", "NTA \nI love it! You\u2019re such a good teacher.

Every teacher has different teaching styles. I had an exam once where I had specific things I needed to remember (obviously). When the exam began, the first thing I did was open to a blank page and write out the points I needed to include in my essay). That way when writing, I was able to work through and address each point knowing I hadn\u2019t missed anything out. Similar concept and I think it\u2019s a great way to help your students. That way in a real exam, they can use the technique in a similar way to what I did and they\u2019ll feel less under pressure.", "NAH I\u2019ve been in (college STEM) classes that allowed a more real \u201ccheat sheet\u201d than you have here. People were allowed one 8 1/2 x 11\u201d of whatever notes they cared to bring with them. Some people wrote a few formulas. Some people used reducing photocopiers to put multiple pages of tiny print on their one page. It was really rather silly, I thought, the energy some put in to bringing as much reference material as possible with them.\n\nI think that even calling them cheat sheets in your case might be part of the problem. Since they only contain what was in the students\u2019 heads already, the name implies something that isn\u2019t true. In what sense is writing down anything you know cheating? I\u2019d probably call them \u201cscratch paper\u201d\u2014a place to write stuff that isn\u2019t the exam itself. \n\nIf your students are being directly compared to other students taking the same subject from a different instructor, then you should be in agreement with that instructor about what materials are covered and how exams are done. But beyond that, I just think this is part of your teaching style and it\u2019s fine.", "NTA. Anti-anxiety isn't a pedagogical reason to change the instrument to measure progress. However, you may have called it a cheat sheet, but it wasn't cheating. You administered the test and fairly and transparently to your students.\n\nYou should spend some time developing a pedagogical reason for your pre-test notes sheet. That way you have a stronger defense against Entitled Parents.", "NAH.\n\nThere is nothing about this that the students could not do themselves on the back of the exam paper, except for the extra 5 minutes.\n\nSome teachers give open-book tests so the student can look up whatever they want, or even bring unlimited notes.

Personally it didnt help me because anything I knew in the first 5 mins I knew for the whole test.

And they felt less freaked out and had fewer 'spacing out' times trying to remember something.

So he learned one fact from the first half of the numbers- 1 x2, 2 x 3, 3 x 4, etc. Then learned how to write those down and just count up and down the number of times to get to say 5 x 8. I arranged with his teacher that he would get an extra 15 mins of test time for his disability so he had time to literally write out all the multiplication tables before every test to reference.

So maybe get together with some other teachers and brainstorm a new name for it (I would definitely involve other teachers, so you are not alone and this idea won't die a sudden death by admin shutting it down). Good luck!", "NTA. I have a similar practice, where I give out a study guide with every question I can ask on the test. They have to look up or know the answers, and can the use the study guide for 3-4 minutes at the beginning of the test. Kids who want to put in the effort get the little boost they need, kids who don't want to don't get anything. I don't offer extra credit, so this is what I do instead. Prepping for a test is \"giving them an advantage\" but it's an advantage they will likely have in real life. \n\nI have found that doing this actually reduces instances of actual cheating... Basically let them cheat on my terms for a few minutes so I don't have the headache of actual cheaters.\n\nETA: the study guides are given out at least a week or so before any exam, although they are available for them to access from the start of a unit on our LMS (Canvas).", "NTA - I adore this approach!  Here are a few reasons why: \n\n1. They are studying by reviewing the material as they create their cheat sheets \n\n2. They are evaluating the material that they are learning by importance and difficulty to remember \n\n3.  They would have resources available to them in the real world.", "You are definitely NTA!! I am a teacher, and I think this is a brilliant idea!!", "The only issue here is the name. Call them \"exam notes\" instead of \"cheat sheets\".", ">5 minute- Brain Storm!\n\nBrilliant, OP repackage the idea with this name and take it back to the admin. Honestly this is brilliant and I would have loved it. NTA", "Yes. I think of the OP rebranded the test style as open note, it would get less backlash.", "Yeah, making the sheets is a form of studying, so yeah it\u2019s a little silly that they try to squeeze in a lot of info, but it still helps people sort through their notes and look at the material", "As another math and physics teacher, I will either give my students a formula sheet, or let them make their own beforehand (more in physics than in math)\n\nYou\u2019re actually doing something with less support than that, since they don\u2019t have their notes out to copy. You\u2019re just asking them to think of all the important stuff, write it down, then use it for the test. (Unless you\u2019re omitting something in your telling, like if you check over it before they take the test)\n\nMight be different in your language, but it\u2019s not really a cheat sheet, more like a brain dump.", "I like the other commenters suggestion of Brainstorm notes.", "NTA. If they didn't know that information before those 5 minutes, they weren't going to know it for the exam anyway. It was literally just a way to help ease their minds.", "NTA\n\nThis is literally how I've started most of my big exams - writing important dates, formula, names, etc. on a blank page.\n\nBut, please re-brand the activity, as others have suggested. I like \"Ms. X's 5-minute brainstorm\" or the like.", "NTA. In highschool we got cheat sheets for exams for several of my classes. It was a full 8.5x11 coloured piece of paper. You were allowed to write on both sides and to take it home and write in stuff from the textbook. \nHonestly it was a good way to trick me into studying. I would go through the entire textbook and write down things I might need. So I was actually reading the textbook AND writing it down, so that stuff was sinking in really well. I would write really small and only cover maybe half of one side. And I usually didnt even really use it much.\nI can see why people would be pissed. But if your students arent even using a textbook and it's just from what they can remember, its no big deal. It's like brain storming before a test. And they could be remembering things incorrectly so it wouldnt be much of an advantage anyway.", "NTA, they know the material off by heart when relaxed. So the point of the exam, is the anxiety???", "NTA. Math teacher here. I don\u2019t do cheat sheets, but I encourage them to write anything they think they will forget at the top of the test when they did it. If it comes from their head, it\u2019s fair game.", "NTA in college I had a teacher allow us to bring in an index card for the tests. Any notes that we could fit on that card was fair game. \nIn reality,  the amount of info someone can write on an index card is negligible. However, it helped calm student\u2019s anxiety. Thus allowed them to do better on the tests.", "NTA - I used to get crazy test anxiety on math tests.  I would look at the first question and every single formula would leave my head.  I told my teacher ahead of time about the anxiety & she and I worked together to figure out how to help me.  We ended up with me writing out the formulas on my scratch paper (that was blank & given to us by HER) before I ever turned over my test to start.  It was stuff I knew, no books, no notes, just stuff that I would blank on when the pressure from the test got to me.  Maybe change how you do it.  Tell them you are going to do a brain dump.... give them all a blank sheet over paper and tell them to just write out notes of everything they are thinking about for the test.... and then just whoops, not take it up until the end of the test.  ;)", "NTA. It's a \"brain dump\" sheet.", "NTA\n\nBack in the '70s I was majoring in Petroleum Engineering and our instructor allowed \"crib sheets\" for our final exams each semester. We used one 3\" x 5\" index card and could hand-write anything we thought would help on both sides of the card. Two stipulations: the printing could not be so tiny we needed a magnifying glass to read it; and we had to staple our crib sheet to our copy of the test when we turned it in. Worked really well and finals were less stressful.", "NTA  \n\n\nas a teacher it is your job to make learning easier, not harder", "Smells like German in this post.\n\nNTA, I think cheat sheet exams are actually way better than closed-book ones.", "I wish we would spend more time teaching kids how to analyze and utilize resources rather than focusing on rote memorization. It'd be better for the students long term and would definitely help people be more able to pick out bad sources.", "I had a teacher who let us do this who called them brain dumps.", "A whole sheet of real paper! What luxury! We got 3x5 cards, so our handwriting got really tiny (which we practiced while we were walking to school up hill both ways).   \n\n\nTo be honest if I was given a whole sheet of paper, I would probably use most of it to put, like, cute kitten photos or something. Because I never had trouble squeezing what I needed onto those cards.", "I\u2019ll tell you after grading.", "Yeah, the students could *always* stop and jot down some notes in the margins or something before answering the test questions, so this is not a cheat sheet exam, it's just teaching the students one particular test-taking technique (write down the thing you're sure you're going to forget before you can forget it). They still had to have everything memorized. \n\nTo me, a cheat sheet exam is one where you get to pick what notes to bring with you. In my science classes in college, we always got one 3x5 note card, and figuring out what to put on the card was part of the test! We were being taught to solve problems, not to memorize facts, so cheating would be largely impossible anyway.", "\"Write down what you know\" is a great technique in math and physics! In college I used to do that on exams (even though we actually got to bring a literal \"cheat sheet\") because then I might get at least *partial* credit or solving the problem, but it also was just really effective at getting me started.\n\nI skipped high school physics entirely, but I managed to get pretty good grades by consistently getting a few extra points that way. It works!", "I agree with you that the labeling is the problem, but I would say it's not even open note. They still had to write everything down from memory! They could always do that in the margins of the test if they wanted to.", "Fair points both! At the point where they used the photocopier I\u2019m not confident they had actually thought about each item they included, but in general that makes sense and fits my personal experience."]}
