In real life, when you want to solve problems, you use all the resources available to you. You do not have to have every little thing memorized to demonstrate understanding of how things work. Cheat sheet exams are more reflective of how the world works than closed-book exams, and your students are developing useful skills to help them later in life. You are not responsible for the fact that not everyone does this.", "NTA\n\nThe word \"cheat sheet\" probably set off that mother. \n\nTo be honest, I used to do something like this before I started taking my own exams. I would write out all the formulas I knew from memory. Any symbols I remembered, and I would even try to organize them. \n\nI didn't copy it from a book or print it out from the computer or bring it from home. I would just tear out the last blank page of the exam or get scratch paper and then write stuff out. \n\nMaybe relabel what you call it:  \n5 minute- Brain Storm!\n\nBecause that's what it is. They are searching their brains for relevant information and organizing it. It's a great way to get them mentally engaged and focused before they get to the first question. Sort of like a warm-up before going for a 5 mile run.", "NTA, they have nothing except for a pen and paper, there are no books around those 5 mins. I think it is a great idea!! I wished my teachers would allow this at my school.. i mean, you are trying out new ways for kids to learn. I dont see how this is a asshole move\u2026  it is just a really good method to calm the kids during a test which can lead to better grades!", "NTA - that seems like an excellent idea! Now not only are you testing them with the exam, you are training them to sort and recall important information themselves, without the prompt of a test question. That will be far more useful to them in life than their ability to take a test.\n\nI'm not sure why anyone would think this constitutes an unfair advantage - it's not as if they have access to outside materials during the test, only their own minds. Most standardized tests allow spare paper to write your own notes as needed anyhow, so if anything it's a standard testing procedure. \n\nGood on you for finding a way to reduce your students testing anxiety and better prepare them for the world ahead. We desperately need more teachers like you!", "NTA: It's brilliant. They do a little pre-exam cramming, focus their thoughts and feel like they're getting away with something.\n\nMy husband used to make cheat sheets for his exams. Took tons of time and rewrote them smaller and smaller so he could hide them easily. He never had to use them because by making them he was actually studying. I have a feeling your students will study and prep for what they want to put on their sanctioned cheat sheets.\n\nIf your admin supports you, keep at it.", "NTA. How could it be a cheat sheet when the source of the \"cheat\" is the examinees' own memory of what they studied? \ud83d\ude11 that outside parent was just being salty.", "NTA. \n\nCase of one person spoiling it for everyone else.", "NTA \n\nyou're trying to help reduce the anxiety of the students and they write what they have learned its not like they copy stuff from their text books.", "NTA, this is pretty good idea. I had many uni exam where we were allowed to have home made cheet sheet with formulas and short notes. It was pretty normal in all uni subjects where you had plenty of formulas like mathematics, physics and statistics.", "NTA\n\nIs this parent upset about open book tests too? Some teachers allow students to use the book to write everything they can on a 3x5\" card. This isn't much different than that. I say, if it works, keep it up.", "I'm going to say NTA based on your post. \n\nIn my country, you are always allowed to write stuff down on a separate piece of paper before/during the exam (without books and notes of course). Also, I don't consider this really cheating. Nobody is using anything extra that they wouldn't be allowed to use during the exam.", "NTA, I mean they have to write the sheet themselves and only from what they can remember. Of all exams starting highschool until my engineering degree you always have a piece of paper to help you during the exam and you can use it at the very beginning to write anything to make sure you don\u2019t forget, that\u2019s normal. \n\nIn the end all you write depends on what you managed to remember enough, only difference with the exam is that is not a direct answer to a question and doesn\u2019t give points in itself.", "Sounds like two people who are taking the word cheat sheet too seriously. It's like giving more time to do a test. If I wrote everything I remembered 5 min b4 a test with no help but mind, it'd feel like I'm just airing out my thoughts and then when I'm doing the test I'm just organizing my thoughts into meaningful and thought out expressions of my studies on the subject. \nYou are NTA you are an inspiration, as you show that you understand the mentality and stress sum of your students suffer from test taking. It's not cheating, it's teaching them to think differently and experience test, that they are clearly prepared for, in a less stressful manner and in turn should have them doing better in all test, even without your version of a \"cheat sheet\".", "NTA.  All they're doing on the \"cheat sheet\" is writing down what they remember, not copying stuff from the textbooks.  \n\nI had a professor in grad school who allowed us to write notes on an 8x11 sheet of paper for the final exam.  I had no margins and 3 point font, but I got everything on there.  I've seen medical doctors look up stuff on Google.  Continue the conversation with admin.", "NTA. They allow them in some university classes aswell. Parent is just looking for something to complain about.", "Nta sounds like a great idea.", "NTA.\n\nI think calling them cheat sheets is a bit misleading. In most of the exams I've taken In high school, and then later at university we were allowed to write \"working\" on the back of the book, or on a provided piece of paper for \"working out\" the answers (which is handed back in at the end of the exam). I've always brain dumped everything I remember immediately after I pick up my pen in the exam. I think it's kind of food exam practice. A great technique to teach at any rate.", "NTH. Most of the student did that in the midst of the pandemic. Much worse than that is they copy pasted thing from internet as the answer!", "NTA \nI love it! You\u2019re such a good teacher. I\u2019m getting my degree right now, when I start to teach, I\u2019m going to use this trick", "Info: what subject do you teach?", "when i was in highschool a few years ago cheat sheets were common on tests,, teachers want you to know the material, not necessarily have it memorized \n\nplus we got time ahead to make our notecards at home ,, she said they were done without books and materials so if anything she just gave them time to organize their thoughts before the test", "NTA. Every teacher has different teaching styles. I had an exam once where I had specific things I needed to remember (obviously). When the exam began, the first thing I did was open to a blank page and write out the points I needed to include in my essay). That way when writing, I was able to work through and address each point knowing I hadn\u2019t missed anything out. Similar concept and I think it\u2019s a great way to help your students. That way in a real exam, they can use the technique in a similar way to what I did and they\u2019ll feel less under pressure.", "NAH I\u2019ve been in (college STEM) classes that allowed a more real \u201ccheat sheet\u201d than you have here. People were allowed one 8 1/2 x 11\u201d of whatever notes they cared to bring with them. Some people wrote a few formulas. Some people used reducing photocopiers to put multiple pages of tiny print on their one page. It was really rather silly, I thought, the energy some put in to bringing as much reference material as possible with them.\n\nI think that even calling them cheat sheets in your case might be part of the problem. Since they only contain what was in the students\u2019 heads already, the name implies something that isn\u2019t true. In what sense is writing down anything you know cheating? I\u2019d probably call them \u201cscratch paper\u201d\u2014a place to write stuff that isn\u2019t the exam itself. \n\nIf your students are being directly compared to other students taking the same subject from a different instructor, then you should be in agreement with that instructor about what materials are covered and how exams are done. But beyond that, I just think this is part of your teaching style and it\u2019s fine.", "NTA. Anti-anxiety isn't a pedagogical reason to change the instrument to measure progress. However, you may have called it a cheat sheet, but it wasn't cheating. You administered the test and fairly and transparently to your students.\n\nYou should spend some time developing a pedagogical reason for your pre-test notes sheet. That way you have a stronger defense against Entitled Parents.", "NAH.\n\nThere is nothing about this that the students could not do themselves on the back of the exam paper, except for the extra 5 minutes.\n\nSome teachers give open-book tests so the student can look up whatever they want, or even bring unlimited notes.  Others allow a \"cheat sheet\" of whatever size but the student can prepare it in advance.\n\nOf course you have to follow your school's rules but whatever method is \"fair\" as long as every student has the same rules.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Since he didn't want to test our memory but how god we understood the matter.", "This seems like a policy issue in your work, not an AH question.\n\nIt sounds like a good idea but if other students are being graded against yours in some kind of rating system they really should have the same opportunity/process.\n\nPerhaps presenting it to the other teachers before rolling it out would have been a good idea?", "NTA\n\nI had some teachers that did this in school. Personally it didnt help me because anything I knew in the first 5 mins I knew for the whole test. However I had several classmates that would cram until the last second, write stuff down on the paper then cruise through the test. It helped them. And they felt less freaked out and had fewer 'spacing out' times trying to remember something. It was like a comfort object to them. \n\nI had one student I tutored in college that had a disability and COULD NOT remember his multiplication tables. So he learned one fact from the first half of the numbers- 1 x2, 2 x 3, 3 x 4, etc. Then learned how to write those down and just count up and down the number of times to get to say 5 x 8. I arranged with his teacher that he would get an extra 15 mins of test time for his disability so he had time to literally write out all the multiplication tables before every test to reference. It was tedious for him. But since he was just taking time to write out what he already \"knew\" to help with his test the teacher was fine with it. He passed the class.", "NTA - This is a variation on an open book exam. I don't know the grade level or the subject you teach, but open book exams are as valid a teaching tool as closed book exams.\n\nI don't see much difference between your aproach and an standard exam. There is nothing that prevents a student spending the first part of the exam period writing notes to themselves. Initially blank scrap paper as a place to do one's work is standard. Using it to write down what is in the student's mind is not cheating by any standard.", "NTA and many students do that already instinctively. I know the moment I sat down for math or physics I would write down in the own exam all the formulas I would need. That gave me peace. Now I could read the questions.\n\nThe hardest exam of my life was open book and I got a C.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve had teachers/professors let us do this.

But maybe changing the name of it to \u201cstudy guide\u201d instead of cheat sheet would be helpful.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised that this is even an issue, this is a pretty standard method of taking tests in my field. You almost always write down certain rules or outlines on your scrap paper before diving into an answer. I guess it makes more sense for essay tests than for multiple choice, but I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s cheating to write down a formula you\u2019ve memorized.", "If that works for you then great! \n\nPersonally, I have never had a problem with exams (even when I fail them) because I think they prepare you to work and cope under stress and duress. \n\nHowever, my kids hate them, I try to encourage them to view it from my perspective, but they never buy into that view and think that I'm old fashioned.\n\nAgain, if it works for you and you can get the best from your kids, then great.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m in college and I\u2019ve had professors letting us do that since middle school and it\u2019s honestly really helpful (especially in college)", "Yep.

I'm an engineering student and have done exactly that on physics exams before. \n\nI see no problem with it as you and the other teacher of the course give the exam in the same alloted time period, only you cut out five minutes to allow your students to focus on writing down formulas they might need. And since they have to write them from memory they could potentially write the formula down wrong, or with a wrong sign (+,-) or something, and then they're using the wrong formula, but that could have happened anyway. \n\nAll my college physics, and similar science classes allowed us to bring a prepared \"equation sheet\" to the exam. But I feel like you are doing this more to calm down your students during the exam than to actually give them any sort of edge.", "You providing in the moment anti-anxiety pre-test notes is not teaching them to manage anxiety. What you did do is 100% a good thing. My exams and quizzes were open book. For the same reason. However, explaining how this helps learning was key for me.
