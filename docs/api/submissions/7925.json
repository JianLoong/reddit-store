If she\u2019s nine, she is absolutely old enough to understand that no one is entitled to everything they want with zero restriction. When you are given a choice, you learn to weigh your options, even if you don\u2019t end up with exactly what you want.", "But she wasn\u2019t given a restriction on the amount of dessert she consumes. She was told if she wanted it she would be forced to \u2018share\u2019 an unspecified amount. In niece\u2019s mind that could have been anything from a spoonful to all of it. Given she started to protect the dessert after a couple of spoonfuls to cousin, we can assume that was her sharing threshold.\n\nIt *is* important to encourage children to share. But forcing them to do so doesn\u2019t actually teach them anything helpful. What we\u2019re trying to teach them with sharing is empathy. We want them to recognise that someone else might want a turn at the toy or a scoop of something. Forcing them to give up something they\u2019re currently focused on or share something of value to them because *you* think it\u2019s time or \u2018enough\u2019 (or because your parents forced you and you\u2019ve internalised it as correct parenting) is not teaching the child empathy. It\u2019s teaching them that their needs and wishes aren\u2019t valid. \n\nAn actual choice designed to restrict the quantity and still provide niece space to practice actual reasoning, followed by support to fulfil her choice consciously and properly would have been:\n\n\u201cYou can get that big dessert if it looks the tastiest to you. However, you will only be allowed to eat half of it because even when we\u2019re having treats we also have to think about our health. Would you still like to get it so you can have half?\u201d  Assuming she says yes, then the follow-up is: \u201cWhat shall we do with the other half? I think your cousin would really like to have ice cream too. Do you think we could put the other half into a bowl for her?\u201d\n\nNow the niece can make a rational choice that allows her to decide whether she wants the desert because it\u2019s big or because it\u2019s tasty. She can also contribute positively to the decision-making around the half she will not eat.  \n\nTHIS is a non-coercive choice and a lesson about empathy.\n\nAunt mishandled this entire thing through unskillful communication and action."]}
