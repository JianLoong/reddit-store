But forcing them to do so doesn\u2019t actually teach them anything helpful. What we\u2019re trying to teach them with sharing is empathy. We want them to recognise that someone else might want a turn at the toy or a scoop of something.

I think your cousin would really like to have ice cream too. Do you think we could put the other half into a bowl for her?\u201d\n\nNow the niece can make a rational choice that allows her to decide whether she wants the desert because it\u2019s big or because it\u2019s tasty.

For instance, \"nobody gets a dessert that's way bigger than the others\" or even separate it out for each one when it arrives before they dig in. If your niece wanted ice cream, you could have got them both a bowl rather than a Sundae. I know it kinda defeats the purpose of ordering what you want, but kids will be kids.  They're not gonna be happy having to share, or none of them will be happy seeing the other with a massive dessert when there's looks tiny in comparison. You're the adult, and that's just common sense. She may be family, but she's not your kid, and to avoid conflict, you should have set clear limitations from the beginning re ordering. I know you say you told her she had to share, but I have 8 nieces and nephews and know what they're like. It's about having the foresight to do what you can to avoid the crap and arguments. Your niece is nine and should know better, but at the end of the day , she's still a kid. Personally, I think it's common courtesy to make sure the one person in that situation (out of everyone) that would have their own dessert would be the kid thats not mine. However, her mother needs to cop on, take the blinkers off her child being an angel, and not make such a big deal about it. She should be teaching her kid to respect your decisions and learn to share, not backing up her behaviour and tantruming over it ... And quite frankly, both your husbands need to tell you both to grow up and stop acting like the kids you're fighting over. It's easy for adults to lose the run of themselves and get involved in arguments over kids, but at the end of the day, it's over a sundae. Again I say ESH. They're family.

Making some of them share never works out. Especially when they are not siblings.", "I would have stopped the kid from buying the dessert if I think she was not going to be able to finish it. I would get her to choose a different one. As for my kid, I would get a dessert for myself and share it with my kid.", "NTA, you did give the opportunity to your niece for each to have their own... She \\*chose\\* to share, then tried not to.\n\nHowever, in the future you should have simply said \"No, you can choose from these options...\" rather than turn it into more of an ordeal. Or have asked for another bowl so you could divide the main dish between the two.\n\nThe mother of melissa is slightly TA... At 9, Melissa should know better regarding sharing after agreeing to do so. She should also teach her kid \"considerate selection\". My parents taught me that just because someone was generous enough to offer to treat me to something, didn't mean they had unlimited means and that sometimes people might not place limitations out of generous sense of hospitality or embarrassment so I should always make my selection considerately and modestly (and confidently so they don't feel I'm actually wanting something else) so as not to take advantage or put them in an uncomfortable position. Even if they say \"Whatever you want\". And that even if they DO have the means, I'm not entitled to take advantage of those means.\n\nSo even as a small child, I'd choose the cheapest thing I'd enjoy. So if I went out for ice cream, a single scoop cup or cone was perfect, even if a brownie sundae looked appealing. I didn't need a sundae, when I could still enjoy and appreciate the single scoop cone or cup. But if I was specifically asked if I wanted a sundae, such as if my friend asked for one and then their parent asked if I'd like one too, I could say yes.\n\nThis also applies to sharing. That even if someone offers to share, we should take modestly of what is offered. Not just treat it as an invitation to take the bulk of it like some people will do.\n\nOn the flip side of this, my parents also taught me that its ok to withdraw an offer or place limitations on those who try to take advantage of our own generosity and hospitality. Its also ok to refuse if asked to share or cover others. But that we can't always expect others to be comfortable doing so for themselves, so we should be proactive in our appreciation and consideration of their gesture if offered and never presume.", "NTA. It's pretty common for kids to order a large desert, and share it with each other. The fact that Melissa first agreed to share it, and then reneged on it, could have made this a teachable moment on how to act responsibly and fairly.

Is it normal in your family for people to swap spit?\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to share a cookie or a piece of cake, but no one wants to eat someone\u2019s backwash by sharing ice cream - in the same container!", "Lol this is honestly so pathetic. Like letting literal children just do whatever?", "Not absolutely TA, but I would have restricted the choices anyway. When your niece showed the biggest (and probably most expensive) sundae, she probably was testing the limits; when she refused to share after having agreed to, same thing. The best thing would have been to tell her no to the sundae from the start, if you wanted no waste\n\nBesides, I think it is slightly unfair to have your daughter have to share it. She didn't get a choice, and she didn't get a nice ice cream experience because she had to fight with her cousin to get any. She deserved a small scoop of her choice just like the others.\n\nAlso, coming from someone who has an eating disorder partly due to such moments: it's okay for children not to finish their plates, especially when said plate is dessert / ice cream. Of course they will want some if it is offered, but their stomach can't take everything, and they don't make those sundaes child-sized, which is a shame, but ultimately not their fault. I was shamed into finishing my ice cream / waffle / whatever too, or forced to share it: this led to me eating to the point of making me sick, and developing tactics not to share food (raiding the cupboards to be sure I'd get to have the [insert sweet treat] I would want instead of discovering I didn't get any because it was shared and being unreasonably upset because sharing had been taught to me as a punishment for enjoying food). \n\nI'm saying that for your niece, though this is more the role of her parents, but also for your daughter: it's better to let her have some ice cream she won't finish rather than risking a twisted relationship to food. Sharing a plate should be agreed between the two parties, if it is imposed you never know how a child's brain will interpret it and what impact it could have on their life later on.", "NTA I can\u2019t believe there are now 5 adults involved in this nonsense.
