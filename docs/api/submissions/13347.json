He said \"that guy is staring at you\" and nodded his head in a general direction. It was about 7am plus I was groggy and thought it was a joke. I looked around the room expecting a poster or cardboard cutout of a guy. Hardy har har. I saw nothing so I just looked at him confused and said \"what?\". So he said it even louder, \"that guy in the blue hat is staring at you\". So I looked around again for a cutout of a guy in a blue hat. That's when I realized he was actually talking about the guy in the chair I was standing 2 feet from who was sitting with his wife/girlfriend. I turned back to get coffee and said \"you need to chill out\" under my breath. I was so shocked and embarrassed. He then followed up with loudly again \"Why? I think it's funny to call him out in front of his wife\". I grabbed my coffee and we left. Once I woke up more I realized the guy was probably just looking at the lanyard I had on for a seminar. I put it on so that I wouldn't forget it for my early morning check in. The poor man was probably just wondering why this person was wearing a lanyard and tried to read it out of curiosity.\n\nAITA for wanting to move out because of this? Hear me out please. To me this was horribly embarrassing. I felt so bad for the guy and his partner.

It also seems like my boyfriend has absolutely no self control and is jealous. Who does that?! And what if the guy stood up for himself? My boyfriend clearly wanted escalation and not deescalation.

I literally saw NOTHING but vague outlines because I was lost in thought and HIGHLY distressed,  at that moment they were being verbally aggressive, the nurse came and I asked my question. It wasn't until fully FIVE minutes LATER (or longer,I was IN the elevator by then)  that it sunk into my consciousness WHAT EXACTLY had happened, and the person was ACTUALLY speaking to ME!!!, I felt so bad and totally would have apologized and explained if I had been \"there\"...so just because someone is looking your way, unless you make eye contact you have no way of knowing they are looking AT you or just in the direction you happen to be. \n\nPeople notice a LOT less than we give them credit for, 95% of the time we feel self-conscious about something, other people in the general public don't notice it because they are in their own head being self-conscious about their own thing!!! \n\nSo if bf didn't make eye contact then he doesn't know either, AND it is super controlling for him to get all weird about it...ask him if he's gonna pee on your leg next before you ditch him.", "NTA, get out and stay out", "NTA\n\nWhat a horribly awkward and embarrassing situation BF put you in.

The man SHOULD be embarrassed in front of his wife if he was checking out other girls. That's exactly how i would hope someone reacts. And why would he be staring at your lanyard? Literally never in the history of history have I done that, even if casually glancing I wouldn't be turned around staring long enough for someone to take notice of it. Grade A excuse making right there, and it makes no sense why you would do that. If you wanted your bf to not start a fight, OK, but... he didn't? You went from telling him to chill out for doing literally nothing, to moving out? Like did I miss something here? Did he take you to the room and beat you for disagreeing? So fkin weird.
