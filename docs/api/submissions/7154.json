Maybe have a sit down with mom and figure out if there are things you can plan to help with. It sounds like she just may have gotten overwhelmed and snapped at you. It\u2019s quite unfair that they have to spend retirement years as new parents, I would give them a little slack in this case and just agree to what the expectations are if a situation like this pops up again.", "I'm confused - sounds like you did what you were asked to do.  I think this is displaced frustration from your mom. NTA.", "INFO: I'm confused as to what your mom is upset about. Your niece was sleeping, correct? So you had the monitor, heard her, went to sooth her and put her back once she was. Did she wake up again? I feel like there is some information missing because based on what you provided, it doesn't sound like you did anything wrong.", "NTA. I'm not sure why she's mad? The baby was sleeping. You listened for her, tended to her when she cried, and got her back to sleep. What more did your mother want you to do?\n\nI would just tell her \"I understand that you're probably under a lot of stress with everything going on, but please don't take it out on me. I did what you asked and looked after the baby. Yelling at me for doing so is unfair.

You walked the baby until she stopped crying? \n\nAm I missing something here?", "NTA\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you did wrong here... She asked you to watch the baby, you watched the baby. When it had an issue, you dealt with it. \n\nDid she expect you to stand in the room and physically watch it the whole time? Next time do yourself a favor and just say no.", "NTA - it sounds like you helped out - not seeing the issue", "Info: Feel like there\u2019s a big chunk of story missing from how it goes from pacifier to your mom blowing up.

Did you fall asleep at 9 on everyone so no one was monitoring the kid or something like that?", "NTA.\n\nYou literally watched and listened for the baby, and got up to take care of her when she cried.\n\nYour mom is being completely unreasonable if she expected you to stay up all night and lose your own sleep when you had work in the morning\n\nThis is your brother's responsibility being forced onto you and everyone else.", "NTA...You're trying and your mother is likely just venting out of frustration.  Hopefully the situation works itself out.", "NTA\n\nSounds like mom has some poor coping strategies. Stress can do lots of negative things, especially if situations are sprung on people/ family members. Try and have an honest conversation about it with her and if she still chooses to be upset, then it's out of your control at that point. If she realizes her short comings, maybe suggest counseling (if you think it wont blow back in your face).", "NTA but is sounds like your mum is just stressed and took it out on you. We can all snap when we're tired and frustrated. Either talk to her calmly about it and get your side across while listening to her, or drop it and move on. Life's too short.", "NTA, I have no idea why she would have a problem with that, guessing she's just unfairly (and being an asshole) taking out her frustration on you.", "NTA: It sounds like you did help and done everything that was required. Sounds like your mother is just bitter at having to look after her and is taking it out on you.", "INFO Where exactly did you not help out when you had the monitor and acted when your niece cried?", "Massively confused as to why there is even an issue with your mother here. You were asked to do something which you did NTA", "NTA. But you really need to get out of that house.", "Your parents have taken on the responsibility to care for their granddaughter. Uncle You lives in the family home.\n\nYour mom asked you to listen out for your niece while she got some things done. That's a reasonable thing to ask in this situation. You said you would, and took the baby monitor to your room with you so you could get your own evening routine done whilst listening out for the baby.\n\nThat seems reasonable enough. No problems here. \n\nAt some point in the evening, she woke and cried, and you settled her down again. (I didn't see you note that you changed her. IME, kids who wake crying like that basically always need changing.)\n\nI'm not sure I understand what your mom's problem is. You listened for your niece and settled her when she woke in the night.

Your niece is decades away from understanding how lucky she is to have you as her uncle.  But she is", "NTA\n\nYou did what you thought was appropriate as an uncle and not a parent, you weren't unresponsive or uncaring to your niece.

I hope I can be.", "I guess that is the root of my concern, is am I am AH for handling it that way in lieu of specific instructions.

I loved her very much and in most ways she was an amazing mother but she had emotional issues from an abusive childhood that she never dealt with and subjected everyone else to.  Honestly, what I found worked with her was to ask for specifics in these situations - \"Sorry mom, I was trying to help with the baby and I thought I was doing a good job, but I'm inexperienced.  Can you let me know what would've worked better so I'll know for next time?\"  It's amazing how disarming that pacifist approach can be, and when I started taking that approach with my mom, it completely caught her off guard and she almost lost the ability to argue back.  Who knows if it'll work with your mom, but I think it'll help.  Again, I don't think you did anything wrong at all, and my goal is not to push you to seek corrective feedback.  It's to subtly and gently put your mom on the spot and say \"What the hell are you actually complaining about?\" without being confrontational and throwing more fuel onto the fire. \n\nTake it from an old man (turning 40 this year) who learned through the pain and tried a million ways before I found what worked.  I will say that my mom died 9 years ago this May and my relationship with her became so much better for the last few when I refused to fight with her anymore and just graciously and kindly demanded that she explain her position rather than just blasting me with anger.", "Maybe your mom should talk to a doctor or something because that doesn't seem like a normal reaction to this situation. Even if she did wake up AFTER you gave the monitor back, that's not on you. I can respect feeling tired/irritable/frustrated, I have an infant to and know sleep struggles, but unless you completely ignored the kid or did something super egregious, NTA.", "I feel like you need to go back to your mother and INFO her to get a better understanding of her concern/issue.\n\nOtherwise this thread is just baffling before you were asked to shortcut the baby, and you did.", "To be fair her nickname 90% of the time is toot or tooter so I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s as caught up on names as we all are, but thanks for your concern.", "**It** is a gender-neutral term for a baby and is proper grammatical usage. I don't think it'll be offended given that it can't read, speak, or remember, nor will it ever come in contact with my comment on an anonymous reddit post. \n\nI don't think you need to be offended on behalf of some random baby.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like you did. Sounds like she took her frustrations out on ya. She should be retired and living her life and being selfish. She\u2019s older and has less energy and has raised her kids. \n\nHonestly I\u2019d just give her hug, tell her you understand this is a really frustrating situation and you love her.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Yeah sounds like you\u2019re correct to assume she\u2019s venting frustration. Blowing up on someone is never right but unless she\u2019s normally like this, I think you might need to give her a small pass on this. I have to imagine raising a toddler in your 60s is like 10x worse than doing it at 40 like she did with you. You\u2019re a good dude for helping out with the kid where and when you can.", "Then NTA. That\u2019s what monitors are for. You don\u2019t need one while you stay in the room.", "I completely understand your concern, that you weren't doing enough. But you didn't do anything dangerous. If people expected you to act a certain way, they would have to tell you. What you have to focus on is while you may not have acted as your parents would have, you didn't do anything dangerous or neglectful.", "I\u2019ve dealt with family members who have only a passing acquaintance with reality and get enormously offended if you contradict them.  It messes with your head.  You did nothing wrong, and consider this a preemptive \u2018you did nothing wrong\u2019 for the next time your mom pulls this too.  Therapy (for you, I mean) can be really helpful.  At your age I was just beginning to realize that my perception of a lot of things about my childhood and my family was not entirely reliable because I\u2019d been seeing it through the lens of my mother\u2019s mental illness.  So let me say it one more time - you have done nothing wrong.  Be kind to yourself.", "I appreciate that advice. That\u2019s how my dad handles it when it happens to him. \nIt\u2019s pretty damn difficult lol but I guess I never framed it as making her consider wtf shes mad about.", "Oof asking most of my family to proactively manage or do anything for their mental health was a fight I tried to fight years ago and it went poorly. But you\u2019re not wrong.", "For a baby whose gender you don't know. \n\nNot that I think it's a big deal, but it's unusual to say \"it\" about a baby you know is a girl.", "Boy, you seem like you\u2019d be real fun at parties\u2026", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s decently usual. Thus the post, makin sure I wasn\u2019t hiding an AH move from myself with the veil of \u201cshe\u2019s always mad\u201d", "Damn. You didn\u2019t have to come for my neck this morning. \n\nThank you kind stranger.", "Oh it's difficult as hell, especially when you know you're not wrong with every ounce of your being.  But not only will it help with your mom, it'll probably help you grow in patience and tolerance of frustrating people in general - it definitely did for me.  So treat it as an awesome growth opportunity for yourself for your entire life and it will hopefully making the tip-toeing feel less irritating.\n\nOne more (admittedly unsolicited) piece of advice...maybe in a good, calm time, just go to your mom and ask how she's doing, like honestly asking and not just settling for her saying \"Oh I'm fine\" or the evasive crap moms like to say.  I'm guessing she didn't ever plan to have to help raise a baby when she's already gotten multiple kids to adulthood.  Building a bridge with her proactively might help her understand that you're a partner and ally in this unfortunate situation and make her less prone to hair-trigger anger.", "I say \"it\" because it's a baby, and one who's gender has no bearing on the situation nor does it have any relevance to me personally. I'll refer to them as he/she once they gain sentience", "Sorry, didn't realize I was the one that posted here asking for judgement.", "Info- what exactly is your mom mad about?", "From this post I don't see how you can be the AH. Probably catching some unrelated flak. Of course I'm bad with criticism when helping so I'd probably say go to the extreme and just say if you don't like how I helped you I won't do it again.", "You never know when it might just fly  away.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur parents agreed to pitch in, you did not.", "Nta", "Nta desire problem you try to do what you can but at the end of the day that\u2019s not your kid I would start honestly being unavailable so you don\u2019t need to help move out soon as you can", "NTA. Babies don\u2019t need to be handled 24/7. If she was sleeping, and you came in when she cried, you did what you are supposed to do."]}
