Zane is so lucky to have you.\n\nThe Big Brother Big Sister program is amazing but there are tons of kids that need it, and Zane being signed up would take away from a kid that really needs it. The program is for kids that don't have enough 1 on 1 time or is lacking a same gender role model (which hes not). I'm guessing Zane gets lots of 1 on 1 with you and he gets some with his mother.\n\nRegardless of all that if you have legal custody then... tough shit Dawn. Tell her you support her being in Zanes life as it would be great for him but she needs to work _with_ you or it will _not_ help him and tell her you will do everything in your power to advocate for what's best for him, and you sincerely hope she will show being a part of his life _is actually_ what's best for him.\n\nI tip my hat to you sir. Keep up the amazing parenting job you took on.", "NTA\n\n\nYou are his guardian and have the right to say that he isn't going to the program since you basically have the same rights as a biological parent.

Why the male role model support has to come only from you?", "Info: why are you so against Zane doing the big brother program? Some of the opposition sounds like (warranted) opposition to his mother and maybe anger that she went behind your back and signed him up? Soft E S H because of your highly emotional reaction when clearly you love this kid so much. I\u2019d let him do the program, but you were right to let them know about the guardianship.

It's a waste of resources. \n\n2. More importantly, the \"mom\" overstepped.

It's fine that Dawn wants to start being in your nephew's life, but this was the wrong way.  It wasn't, frankly, even \\*being\\* in his life.  It was getting some other guy to be in his life.", "NTA\n\nSounds you\u02bbre all the parent that your son needs.", "NTA, Zane doesn't need a male figure, you are his male figure and you have been for most of his life.

She's going to make Zane's life hell if she keeps trying to pop up in and out of his life acting like her opinions are worth anything. She forfeited any right to that boys life a long time ago.", "NTA. She is just wanting to milk the single-mom-dead-dad card - probably in hopes of landing herself a new man amongst other things.

You've willingly stepping into the fatherhood role for Zane and it brightens my heart to know there are people like you in the world.\n\nYour heart is in the right place and I feel sure you will help Zane grieve in whatever way works for him, but you also sound like you will ensure that Zane knows the good things about his father.\n\nI applaud your loyalty to Zane and to your brother.", "Ugh, honestly you probably should move. NTA", "So at the moment you are the guardian and the parental rights have not been terminated ... correct?\n\nSo here's the thing, I agree that Dawn is a shit mother. I agree that you have really stepped up to clean up your brother and Dawn's mess. I don't agree that you get to treat Dawn as a nobody. Even when she was a drunk, drug addled addict she was the legal parent. \n\nIf she is now exercising visitation then the courts must have determined she is capable of caring for a child. If you are seen to be in anyway to be interfering with the visitation or attempt a reunification it will not go well for you. I am both a foster parent and family lawyer, I truly understand how frustrating you situation is, but if you didn't consider the big brother program a good idea - and my professional opinion is that they run a quality program that is appropriate in the situation you described your nephew as being in - then you should have dealt with it in a less confrontational manner. It's amazing how quickly I've seen reunification in these situations occur and you no longer have your brother's support for a more permanent arrangement. Given the child's age, if Dawn remains clean, has housing, a job and attends regular visitation she will probably regain custody within a year or 2. I know from personal experience how hard that is to comprehend and that you may think she will fall down long before that happens, however, you shouldn't bet on that. You need to start preparing the child now (without discussing it with him) for situations other than living full time with you, because you can't guarantee that situation will continue.", "I\u2019m just confused. Is there some trans or homophobia going on here? Why doesn\u2019t she see the male raising him as a male influence?", "Soft ESH. You seem to be more forgiving of your brother than his partner, even though they were both drug addicts. Your nephew might not need another male role model, but if his mother is trying to act more responsibly then that is something you should be encouraging. Instead you called her a loser, despite the fact that she, too, is likely still dealing with grief. Carry on doing what is right by your nephew, but don't alienate his mother in the process. If you continue to belittle her and she cleans up her act then manages to regain custody, you may lose access to your nephew, at which point he definitely will need a male role model.", "YTA you let your brother be abused and he ended up dying over it.", "YTA, you should try to exercise compassion if it seems she\u2019s getting clean and doing her best to be a mother to her son even though she has failed before due to the illness of addiction.  This boy lost his biological father and does not need to lose any connection with his biological mother too. Not to mention, she could get back custody and then, good luck trying to maintain your presence in his life, if you have treated his mother with hostility.\n\nThe Big Brother initiative seems to have been well intentioned on her part even if severely misguided.  You could have addressed that way differently.", "Nta. But I would rethink talking to his mother that way. If the kid finds out it could lead to him resenting you down the line.\n\nIt sounds hard in this situation,  but if you really would do anything for the kid, take the high road and be polite.", "ESH is what I'm leaning towards. Did anyone ask the kid what he wants? I'm concerned you both just hate each other so much that you're both focused more on that than what would make him the most happy.", "I'm starting to realize people think drug addicts are terrible people without even knowing how they became addicted in the first place.\n\nDoes no one see that they're probably hurting?\n\nThis world has lost its compassion.\n\nEverything isn't black and white, it's grey and complex.", "War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength? \n\nWho wants that?", "NTA.   Just continue to protect that boy!!", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, her signing up your son was wholly inappropriate as it would take resources away from a child who doesn\u2019t have a male figure in their life.

If/when Dawn remains clean, this won't be looked on fairly by the courts -- mother tries to get child community support, current legal guardian undoes it, w a side of open contempt for the mother.", "That's what I'm wondering???", "legitimately dont understand why 90% of these posts dont get followup questions like this. \n\nthere is no logical reason to assume that this kid wouldnt benefit from the program, i lost my father at 15 and had 0 positive male role models, i cant imagine thinking anyone could have too many. this kid needs all the love and support he can get, im struggling to see the logic in rejecting the program purely because his mom suggested it, her being a dipshit loser or whatever is completely irrelevant to whats best for this kid, a broken clock can still be right twice a day.", "Choosing drugs over your children makes you a bad parent. It doesn't make you a bad person in your heart, incapable of redemption, or unworthy of empathy. But it does make you unfit to make parenting decisions. Addicts who leave their children and then attempt to assert dominance as a parent without doing the actual work to reestablish relationships with their children do more harm than good.", "It doesn't matter if they're a bad person or not, she's a bad parent and that's all that matters here.", "Being a good person and a bad parent aren't mutually exclusive. In my experience being a drug addict and a good parent are.", "Me too, I love it and it\u2019s so satisfying to say out loud", "Me too! Oh, and NTA, OP. So glad Zane has you. \ud83e\udd70", "Did you not read the post? It specifically states that he stopped the kid from getting a big brother.", "I have sympathy for OP. He loves this child like his own and has been caring for him for the last 6 years. Suddenly his brother is dead and the mother is back persuing meaningful involvement in the child's life. The chances now of OP ever being the legal parent of this child instead of guardian have gone from nearly certain to almost nothing and to top it off if the visitation continues successfully they will probably start looking at reunification again. It really really sucks, and I feel badly everytime I see someone go through it.\n\nHowever, OPs response wasn't appropriate. If OP has concerns about the big brother program (which professionally I think is appropriate in this situation) other than feeling like it was dismissing his role in his nephews life he could have discussed it civilly with the mother. He may currently be able to do what he did but how he went about it and what he said will not be looked upon favourably in court. These actions will just form a picture in the courts mind of a person who is trying to alienate the mother and having done hundreds of these cases across my career I say with absolute certainty that if the mother presents even a semi competent picture the court will side with her.", "In a lot of places there are not enough volunteers, so a child who doesn\u2019t have an uncle, would not get help.", "If only the kid had an uncle he could look up to.", "Think of a child who doesn't have a loving uncle in his life and now won't have a big brother either because this kid, who also has a loving uncle also has a big brother. Limited resources", "[deleted]", "Because they usually have more kids needing mentors than they have mentors.  If you give the kid a big brother then it is possible that another child might not get a big brother.", "Well whether the kid needs a female role model or not, this post is clearly about the mother trying to arrange a big brother despite the fact that the kid has a male role model in their life. Like I said but clearly didn't articulate simply enough, a male child with a male parental figure in their life full time isn't the intended target of the big brother aspect of the program.", "Okay, THAT makes sense", "So did your brother? You seems to have a lot of empathy for him and zero for Dawn, despite them sharing the same sins.", "I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. And clearly your anger and frustration are directed at her, which is totally valid. There\u2019s a lot for you to be upset about and I wanted to highlight, for your sake and for your nephew\u2019s, that the big brother program isn\u2019t the actual issue here.
