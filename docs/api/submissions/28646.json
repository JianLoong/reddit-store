Zane is so lucky to have you.\n\nThe Big Brother Big Sister program is amazing but there are tons of kids that need it, and Zane being signed up would take away from a kid that really needs it. The program is for kids that don't have enough 1 on 1 time or is lacking a same gender role model (which hes not). I'm guessing Zane gets lots of 1 on 1 with you and he gets some with his mother.\n\nRegardless of all that if you have legal custody then... tough shit Dawn. Tell her you support her being in Zanes life as it would be great for him but she needs to work _with_ you or it will _not_ help him and tell her you will do everything in your power to advocate for what's best for him, and you sincerely hope she will show being a part of his life _is actually_ what's best for him.\n\nI tip my hat to you sir. Keep up the amazing parenting job you took on.", "NTA\n\n\nYou are his guardian and have the right to say that he isn't going to the program since you basically have the same rights as a biological parent. Also his mother is an asshole since she didn't quit drugs when she had the chance and now she wants to send 'her' child to the program when she doesn't have legal rights to do it.", "NTA\n\nThis child is your responsibility, and in any event she lied to them to get him into the program.", "NTA.\n\nYou're the legal guardian, she's got no rights.  You did the right thing.  Also that would have been a waste of the programs resources, kids that really don't have a male figure in their life can use one.", "Nta", "NTA. Sounds like he needs more of a mother figure if anything.", "info: why exactly are you not letting him do the program? I don't understand what that's about", "NTA. You\u2019re doing what\u2019s best. It might not look like that to everyone but keep at it. Derek also agreed that it was best.", "NTA. Big Brother is for children who don't have a male parental figure in their life. Zane has one.", "INFO: Why on earth are you opposed to Zane getting as much support as he can? Why the male role model support has to come only from you?", "Info: why are you so against Zane doing the big brother program? Some of the opposition sounds like (warranted) opposition to his mother and maybe anger that she went behind your back and signed him up? Soft E S H because of your highly emotional reaction when clearly you love this kid so much. I\u2019d let him do the program, but you were right to let them know about the guardianship.

It's a waste of resources. \n\n2. More importantly, the \"mom\" overstepped.
