But I later found out that my sister excluded everyone else bc \"it should be the MOH job\" and just showed up with a fully booked plan before the others could even start discussing ideas.\n\nThe whole party was supposed to be a surprise but I expected that we'd be doing something that they know I'd enjoy.

Afterward we had a private photoshoot with lots of dresses for me - I mean they were georgous but not something I'd ever feel comfortable in. We ended it with a dinner at a fancy restaurant where she preordered dishes that had meat in it. I'm mostly vegan and she knows that.\n\nAll of those were cool ideas and I'm sure many brides would enjoy a bachelorette like that. Hell I'd plan one exactly like that for my sister or best friend but it's just not me. I told her that I hated it but I appreciate that she clearly put a lot of effort and money into the day. The others knew I would't like it so they planned another party yesterday and that one couldn't have been better (we had a medival dinner at a castle and they booked a cinema where we played video games and drank cocktails the whole day!!) But we excluded my sister and now she's REALLY mad. In fact, my whole family is mad for having a second one and not being grateful for the one my sister planned for me.\n\nI can understand she's hurt and I feel horrible so I consider repaying her the money she spend but I'm not apologising for my interests - shouldn't a bachelorette party be for the bride? And I was just honest when she asked me if I liked it! Even though I do feel like I'm being an ungrateful asshole bc she clearly put lots of effort into planning the day.

Not what you would want. NTA. \n\nAlso, IMO, you need to fire her as MOH (and probably as a bridesmaid), because I'd bet a pretty penny that after feeling snubbed by the bachelorette situation she *will* cause drama if she's allowed to make a speech (you also will need to tell the DJ to cut the mic off if she ever gets her hands on it)\n\nETA: You also shouldn't feel guilty about the effort she spent planning. She spent that effort so she could have a day SHE would enjoy. All her reward is in the stuff she got to do that day, and she is entitled to nothing else.", "NTA your sister planned her own hen party.  Also it's not that hard to book a spa and a restaurant. Barely much effort there at all and clearly no thought into what you as a person would want. I'd just tell the family \" am I meant to be thankful that she clearly doesn't know me? Not respects my diet or my friends input?\" I'd honestly also demote her from being MOH at the very least", "NTA\n\nYour sister seriously does not know what your are in to and what you eat?\n\nSounds like she planned it for herself not for you. She planned it without asking you what you want.\n\nGlad the one your friends organised was better, sadly i think your sister is going to be sore about this for quite a while.", "NTA.   \nYou went to HER bachelorette.   \nThen you went to your own.", "NTA. Like the other people in the comments have said she planned a day for HERSELF, not for you. Not only that but she also in doing so showed a very clear disregard for your wishes, dietary preferences, and just overal personality. You told her you didn't enjoy it, you had a party that you wanted to have.\nHas your family told you why they're siding with your sister on this one? Maybe she has told them a version of events that doesn't really add up with what actually happened.", "A lot of expectations flying around here.\n\nYou worded the paragraph on the original party like it was fine, but told her that you hated it. Your sister sounds like someone who\u2019s perhaps not great with EQ (insisting on doing it on her own, organising something that doesn\u2019t take into account your interests), but it doesn\u2019t sound like her intention was to ruin it. It still took effort - something you acknowledged as well.\n\nI\u2019m not sure of the \u2018norms\u2019, but I\u2019d think that if catering to the bride\u2019s wishes is compulsory, the bride should make these wishes explicit. Think of it this way - someone wants to get you a gift for your birthday. You can either let it be entirely up to them, or provide them with a wishlist. Even in the case of the latter, no guarantees, right?\n\nI think the main AH-ish thing your sister did was the inclusion of meat, because it specifically excludes you. That was thoughtless, but that\u2019s about it. In your feedback to her, that should have been included - after thanking her for everything else. \n\nHaving a second party is not necessarily an issue, though it may wound her a little - it\u2019s the exclusion.  You can\u2019t say that it\u2019s a friends-only event either - if I\u2019m not wrong, the participants are the bride + bridesmaids, sans the MOH. It comes off as petty. It reads like a punishment for not planning the ideal party. And if you can\u2019t see that, then you\u2019re simply in the same league as your sister re:EQ issues. \n\nAll this makes me thing that yeah, YTA somewhat. Your sister is not exempt from it, but neither are you.", "When you say excluded her, do you mean she wasn't involved in organising the second one or she wasn't even invited to it?", "You're totally right about the Bachelorette party she planned for you.  You have every right as a Bride to have what you want for that.  However I think it was a mistake to exclude your sister from the 2nd party.  I think still inviting her could've been a way to try and keep the peace.", "You had a vegan medieval meal? Or was that one of your not so vegan days of your \u201cmostly vegan\u201d lifestyle?", "ESH. \n\nYou set your sister up for failure a little bit. I\u2019ve been a co-MOH before, and it\u2019s hard enough planning anything with two people, nevermind giving every single person in the party equal input. Nothing would get done. That\u2019s in part why you appoint a MOH in the first place, because someone needs to take lead on making decisions like that. That\u2019s why you appoint someone who really knows you and understands you. \n\nEverything about it being a surprise was also a bad approach. Elements of the bachelorette party can definitely be a surprise, but IMO the bride should provide guidance. \n\nI also think it\u2019s kinda crappy that they didn\u2019t invite your sister to bachelorette party #2. Are they punishing her? \n\nYour sister should\u2019ve taken into account your interests more and definitely your dietary restrictions. But I also feel like you put her in a shitty position, and then punishing her by not inviting her is odd.\n\nETA: people have brought up that OP didn\u2019t appoint her sister as MOH, but that only underscores my second point. If you have someone serving as MOH that you didn\u2019t choose and doesn\u2019t know and/or support your interests, absolutely the bachelorette should not be a complete surprise.", "ESH.\n\nSis sucks for planning her ideal day, rather than yours, especially the disrespectful lack of vegan food at dinner.\n\nYour friends suck for organising a second bachelorette party and excluding her. It could so easily have been just a friends' party, unrelated to the wedding, or branded as further festivities including the MOH, but no, they had to call it a bachelorette party *and* exclude one of the group.\n\nAnd you suck, for not gracefully accepting the day planned by your sister, and going along with the \"alternative bachelorette excluding MOH\" scheme.", "Could've just let her be fr and still involved her I mean she's your sister for crying out loud", "OMG. You\u2019re such a baby and come off entitled as hell. You\u2019d seriously consider a life altering rift with your sister over a stupid party that is completely unnecessary and self absorbed? You may not be the AH, but you\u2019re a dummy. Get a grip, your focus should be on your MARRIAGE, not the opportunity to make everything about you for months and months. \n\nHave you considered the cost, effort, aggravation, not to mention putting your life on hold just to be in a wedding party? How many events do you need? I almost killed my brother, being his best man cost me $6k, yes, you read that right. There were months of events, which forced me to put my life on hold to cater to this. We had to pull back significantly in other areas to afford this. \n\nGuess what, your wedding is a 6 hour party you should be throwing for your guests, who are traveling, getting hotels and giving you money. Its not an invitation to be a selfish jerk off for a year. \n\nA second bachelorette party? Who are you?

If she would like those things, then maybe she thought you would too. She got it wrong, but you handled it poorly. You could have had the day with your friends too. You didn't have to tell your sister you hated something she put so much effort into.  What have you achieved by that? Other than upsetting her unnecessarily.\n\nMaybe I am biased because I like my sisters and appreciate any effort they go to for me, even if it is not exactly what I would choose.  You let it be a surprise rather than getting involved in the planning, so you have to accept it won't be exactly what you would plan if you were involved.", "Your sister messed up but I don't understand why she wasn't invited to the second party? Unless you were planning on keeping it a secret this was bound to cause friction. If she'd have been invited she would have understood what it is that you enjoy surely? Sidenote: isn't a medieval dinner mostly meat!?", "EHS\n\nToo bad you didn't like the party your sister planned. She made an obvious mistake with the restaurant and the activities. But if you want a certain type of hen party you need to be involved when planning the day. If you want it to be a surprise then you can't really complain if the party is not what you wanted. \n\nGood thing you got to have a better party later, but excluding your sister was a d*ck move imho.\n\nHope you have a great wedding :)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

All I see is that everyone wins here - your sister gets to feel like a \u2018real\u2019 MOH and you get a bachelorette party you actually enjoy.\n\nI\u2019d maybe speak with your sister and family about what\u2019s really going on. It isn\u2019t normal for a MOH to exclude all the bride\u2019s friends from the party planning, to plan a day clearly suited to themselves and not the bride, and to then get upset when you express any discontent over it. It sounds like your sister is incredibly jealous of you and isn\u2019t dealing with your upcoming wedding very well. Have this conversation now before she pulls another stunt at your actual wedding!", "NTA I agree with everyone else do not let her be part of your bridal party or let her near a mic! After reading your explanations/replies OP she will make it about her. You deserve one day focused on your fianc\u00e9 & you \u2026.. despite your sisters tears or tantrums!", "YTA why didn't you invite her on party 2?", "NTA, and maybe the sister isn't an AH too. Maybe she just missed the target, but she did pay for everyone and she did put thought into it so I don't think she acted that way selfishly, at least not entirely. Hate is a strong word, so maybe you could have expressed your feelings with milder words and explain that you wanted one more day of fun, including her. \n\nPs, your second bachelor sounds like a dream one...\n\nEdit to add: I saw in the comments that your friends posted pictures from the second bachelor on social media, while there were none of the first one. That really was a public dig at the sister, since everyone knew she was the moh. I would say YTA for that. Since you excluded her, you should at least have asked your friends to not post anything.", "Your wedding is for you. I\u2019m an old man but feel that the bride should be treated like a princess on all wedding related activities.  You should get what you want.", "YTA. \nYou could have handled this with a lot more grace. Your sister probably didn't realize how much you'd dislike it. She spent a lot of money. She invested a lot of time. \n\nI get it wasn't your thing. Wouldn't have been mine, either. But you should have accepted the gesture and been gracious. Instead, you acted like a preschooler who got a present she didn't like on her birthday. \n\nIf I were your sister, this would be the last time I ever went out of my way to help you. Baby shower? Nope. Birthday party? Nope. In fact, i would probably find a way to have a whole lot less to do with you in general. \n\nAll the NTA comments just confirm to me that Reddit is mostly a conglomeration of spoilt, overgrown 13 year olds. \n\nBTW, if this is how you handle someone's gesture not landing just exactly right, your marriage is going to suck.", "Anyone not saying NTA is probably missing the little part that implies the bridal party *contains several men.* Not to have gendered expectations or anything but I really feel like a spa day with nails and a shoot with a bunch of dresses is going to really suit a male party.", "Why exclude your sister from your second party? I don't blame you for having it, but I think she should have been invited.", "No, not the AH\n\nAt my wedding, she was the MOH.  There was no Bachelorette. \n\nI was a regular bridesmaid at hers.  Oh, and sight unseen, they ordered a bridesmaid dress two sizes too large.  ( I had lost 30 lbs that year. ) fortunately it was a wrap dress, but that only went so far. \n\n Kids were allowed, my daughter was just 2 , and EVERYONE insisted that she be allowed to play with the other two girls, rough tomboy that wound up pushing her into tables.  While I was comforting my very upset toddler, the groom came to get me for photos.  I asked for 5 minutes.  And she was fine after that 5 minutes, but by the time I found them, they were done with the formal photos.  \n\nNot just because of that, but for a myriad of AH behavior on her part, I have been happily  NC for over 20 years.", "I'm hovering between ESH and YTA", "NTA.\n\nShe didn't plan that party for YOU. She planned it for HER. I'm glad your friends planned you something you'd enjoy.", "ESH and at the same time NAH. She tried. She planned, she seemed to invite who you wanted. Did you communicate any preferences in advance? Maybe she wanted to give you something she didn\u2019t foresee you planning for yourself but would enjoy. She didn\u2019t get you the party you wanted, you have every right to plan a second, but to tell her you hated everything and exclude her seems harsh. The party yes is for the bride but also the attendees. \n\nMy sister and I had vastly different ideas of a bachelorette party which likely means our guests did too. We each helped plan parts of each other\u2019s and let other friends do the same for us. \n\nGiving your sister a title and expecting her to know exactly you want are vastly different things. Why take her title away as MOH just because she didn\u2019t do a good job catering to you? This isn\u2019t a job offer  where if she messes up someone\u2019s life is on the line.

I think she wanted to throw you a traditional bachelorette day and she spent a lot of time and money on it. She isn\u2019t like you so doesn\u2019t fully understand your way of thinking even if you have argued about it in the past. She probably thought you would really enjoy it anyway. And she didn\u2019t burden anyone else with paying for it. That was a sisterly live gesture btw. And she should have been included in the other bachelorette party after you should have told her thank you for a lovely day and all of her hard work. Could have just said y\u2019all were having another party while you have the chance. That would have opened her eyes to a different kind of fun and she may have enjoyed it also.", "ESH, she planned her ideal bachelorette for you which is asshole move, but considering you said exclude you didn't even extend the invite to her for the 2nd one.

But you ARE TA for purposely excluding your sister and seemingly relishing in it. It's just cruel. She's your sister and she tried her best to give you a special day.", "YTA just for telling her you hated it.  And then not even inviting her to the second one.

It sounds like you are a bit different regarding interest and hobbies than the rest of your family?\n\nSomeone said make it drama-free. I highly agree.

You\u2019ve left your sister feeling awkward and alienated from the rest of the wedding insiders- or whatever the term is.\n\nAs others have pointed out, by snubbing your sister you are risking drama at your wedding. You suck also for not inviting her to party number 2, and not clearly framing it as an extra party, rather than a replacement party for your sister\u2019s offering. That would have been a more elegant approach to the problem.\n\nYour friends really ought to have put a stop to your sister\u2019s plans, because it\u2019s very clear that they were not a fit for your interests.

That\u2019s just being entitled. She didn\u2019t organize a party for you and spend possibly thousands out of malice but what your friends did and you allowed was purely out of malice.

I'd rather have them not be at the wedding than ruin it for everyone who is there. \n\nYou're probably right about it being a reward for her.. she never really gets spa treatments and she's the one who got the most photos taken at the shoot :/ But she essentially paid for everyone not just for her.

She deliberately planned a shower that her sister would NEVER like because she's spoiled, entitled, selfish and had been enabled by their parents their whole lives. My sister knows me backward and forward, and hers does as well. I was raised that no one ever has to do a thing for you so always be grateful, but I was also raised to see selfishness and manipulative behavior for what it is. She knew her sister wouldn't like any of what she planned because she chose her own favorite things (they're basically opposites) so she made sure to pay for it to keep the upper hand. I had two friends in high school who were sisters and two years apart, and when they got angry with each other the younger one would pull the same type of crap. Their mother actually caught on by the time we were almost adults, so the younger one started \"tattling\" to their father because he always took her side. OP mentioned here that her sister was quick to tell their parents but leave out the parts about it being her favorite things and OP's not so favorite things...total manipulative move. Now, I have always had a wonderful relationship with my sisters and would never have left them out of the second party, but I can't say I don't understand why OP did it here. It's possible her other friends eanted her to actually enjoy herself and they knew the sister would ruin all the fun; I'm only assuming because I don't actually know these people LOL. People calling the sisters' planning of the shower a simple mistake are completely wrong; a mistake is something down unintentionally, and based on OP's own words her sister knows her very well and knew she wouldn't like what she planned. What would most of you think if your sister planned an event for you filled with all her favorite things, things she absolutely KNEW you disliked, and it's common knowledge that she's been spoiled and coddled by your parents her whole life and could never stand anyone else getting more of the spotlight than her?

Guess we were just brought up differently, I was brought up to be honest with how I felt about something but to also explain that while I may have hated the gift I did appreciate that the person tried to give me something nice,  let me give you an example of what I think of as someone acting like an infant vs acting like an adult in this situation\n\nInfant: \"EWW!! THIS IS DISGUSTING!!! I HATE IT, TAKE IT BACK... I DON'T WANT IT!!\"\n\nAdult: \"Oh, um... Thanks for the gift, it's not really something I like but I do appreciate that you even thought to get me something as nice as this, I'm sure others would have loved this, i tried it but it's just not for me, once again though, i do appreciate the thought!\"", "She didn't disregard it, she appreciated it, despite the fact that none of it was remotely geared towards anything she'd like. She's also talking about reimbursing her sister, therefore paying for her sister to have had the day of her life. Could she have sugarcoated it? Sure, but we don't know how they normally approach these things with each other. You can appreciate the effort behind a gift while still letting the person know it wasn't really for you. The sister didn't take her into account at all when planning it, and you think she's the only one who should be taking other people's feelings into account? \n\nHer sister CHOSE to take this job on, she's also chosen to make the celebrations geared toward what she herself likes. It's not OP's job to coddle her feelings when she didn't do the same for her.", "Total nonsense. OP\u2019s sister did this because she wanted to give herself a gift. OP even mentioned most of the pictures were of her sister. She actively prevented and blocked OP\u2019s friends from throwing her a party she\u2019d actually enjoy. \n\nThen after OP got a bachelorette\u2019s party that she got zero enjoyment out of, thank god she had friends who really care about her and put together a party for her that she\u2019d enjoy.\n\nThen her shitty sister instead of being embarrassed that she used her sisters bachelorette party to throw herself a party she then has another problem because it exposes her as a selfish asshole. So she\u2019d rather her own sister not get a bachelorette party that she enjoys\u2014thus fixing what she failed to do\u2014than have her look bad and take accountability.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to give a gift, do it based on what the recipient will actually enjoy or just don\u2019t waste everyone\u2019s time and money.", "Are you a mind reader or just assuming? If you can read minds please post accredited proof.", "Maybe. We don\u2019t have the information to say that, to be honest. One thing I\u2019m really questioning is OP saying she\u2019s \u201cmostly\u201d vegan and sister should know that. What does mostly mean? Does OP usually eat vegan at home but eats meat when out? Or at family dinners when the parents make meat related food? I\u2019m not sure and it\u2019s not impossible sister has seen OP eating meat and figured it was fine.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. Mistake or willful ignorance, \u201cyour sister is obviously going to make a big scene even though we have no evidence that\u2019s the case so fire her immediately and create as much drama as possible in your family\u201d is bad advice without a lot more information on how sister is. If sister is someone who would create a huge scene and/or has threatened to, then yeah, that might be for the best, but we don\u2019t have that information.", "That's a pretty rubbish take, you can't change words to suit your individual needs in a society and then cry foul when the words are used correctly.", "That would make sense\u2026if it was a nice party. \n\nThis was not. Getting nails and mask maybe, but uncomfortable dresses and meals she couldn\u2019t eat? What\u2019s the point", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a \u201cnow\u201d issue. But I think that\u2019s true. It costs nothing to be kind to people and usually makes their day (and makes your life better, too).", "\"it's not exactly what I want or like so it's trash\"\n\nThe entitlement of people in this sub is something else.", "OP describes herself as mostly vegan. Mostly is not entirely vegan. I\u2019m not saying the sister did good but I am saying that OPs reaction feels a bit harsh. IMO. We only have her side to interpret and I guess we\u2019re all reading this differently", "Does one have stable and long-lasting relationships with friends and family if one sees everything black and white and takes extreme consequences because of it?", "For her *mostly vegan* sister. Lol", "Because there's a difference between I don't know my sister enough to know what she would like and being self serving to me at least it reads more like she missed the mark hard on what her sister would have wanted but that makes her just a shitty party planner ntl a monster", "Everyone loves spa treatments so just because the sister likes them doesn\u2019t mean it was self serving. If I take you out for a steak to celebrate you and I also like steak, my liking steak doesn\u2019t make it automatically self serving.", "She had the *gall* to enjoy her day out?? Heavens! I think I'm getting the vapours!", "I'm just trying to point out that even smart and caring daughters can turn into entitled brides. Fortunately they go back to normal after the wedding.\n\nBut some may destroy the bond they have with their family or sister forever because of their behaviour.", "Who on earth cares??? Again, people always say that vegans are the ones being so particular and uptight about labels and not being allowed to eat anything that an animal has even looked at, cause then they'll no longer be a real vegan. But yet again, here we are, and you're sitting doing the exact same thing for no good reason. What are you achieving? What do you get out of defining what's vegan or not? Or is it just your insecurity being so loud that you can't handle people being called vegan unless they live up to a very strict set of guidelines, because you feel morally inferior and guilty due to their very existence, and thus you get upset and irrational at the thought of someone who doesn't live up to said moral ideals in your mind being called a vegan, since they haven't lived up to the behaviour which is deserving of this label that you perceive as containing a moral judgement or mark of excellence?\n\nOr maybe you're just a freak yelling at the void with nobody to hear you or care what you have to say. Or maybe both.", "I'm befuddled. She would never get so much as a birthday card from me after this  if she were my sister.\n\nShe sounds like a middle schooler, right down to misspelling \"Medieval\" and calling herself \"mostly vegan.\"\n\nTiresome brat.", "Mostly vegan probably means vegetarian with vegan preferences. Or vegan in food but would wear leather. In other comments she said that sister told her to just give the meat to someone else and to just eat the fruit from the desserts. So she doesn\u2019t eat meat.", "The thing is, with people like this, they don't often think about it like that per se. Rather, it's a subconscious outcome of their maladaptive thought processes. \n\nWe can't say if this sister is that kind of person, but it feels likely with the evidence. And anyone who's ever dealt with a narcissist can say that this kind of power play does happen, subconsciously fulfilling some messed up need.", "\ud83d\ude06 I love scrolling reddit for this reason. Its super easy to tell internet strangers to divorce or NC every family member for some off-the-wall reasons. You said it right, some people just wana watch the world burn \ud83d\ude06", "Jesus you really think after reading a post that involves the family choosing her sister as a maid of honor, then a clear boundary violation is an okay thing? Let me guess you have a perfect family that would never do something against your interests. Have some perspective, if a friend agreed to help you, so you rely on them for something only to find out they did something else for themselves you would be pissed! But you can't see how her sister screwed her over so she could get what she wants, there is an infant here and it's not OP", "I was raised to believe that adults don't use pretexts of.honesty to hurt others or to excuse rudeness. \n\nApparently you weren't raised with those manners. It appears OP's parents attempted and failed to raise OP with any.", "1. OP is a vegan and the pre-planned meals had meat. \n2.  Also, OP says quite clearly that the things her sister planned are nothing like what she likes to do.\n\nDid you read her post at all?", "According to OP's comments, sister and her often had fights about her being vegan, so sister definitely knew. And you don't know someone all your life without knowing things they like and don't like. \n\nWith mostly I would suspect cheats on things more like eggs or dairy or honey than on meat. \n\nAnd while I agree we don't know how sister is, OP knows how sister is and it's up to her. The fact that she never wanted her sister as moh in the first place says a lot to me though.", "Didn't see anyone say it's trash. But it is incredibly rude and acknowledging that doesn't suddenly make the person acknowledging it the rude one.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is calling the sister a monster, like c\u2019mon now. But she had all of the other bridesmaids to help her, and they clearly knew what the bride liked, but instead of planning the day together she decided to do it all by herself so she\u2019s literally the only one to blame for planning a party the person being celebrated didn\u2019t like. And OP has said in comments that the sister at least knew about her not eating meat and sister still pre ordered meat for her. Personally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask to be able to eat at your own bachelorette party.", "But clearly OP didn\u2019t like them and would have preferred something else and it was a party for her.", "Apparently she was the only one enjoying it! But maybe you\u2019ve also only had shitty parties planned for you so you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be taken into consideration for things like your own bachelorette party.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t get why people are taking this so personally and acting like it\u2019s *so* confusing. She\u2019s vegan most of the time but accommodates a bit of flexibility sometimes when she needs to. It\u2019s not that hard to understand.", "Ok hadnt seen that comment. Yea her sister not having an entree available for her is bad", "Right?\n\nFeels like they are projecting some of their own issues on the OP.", "I don't see being honest with how you feel about a gift as being rude or hurtful, just cause you don't like something doesn't mean you dont appreciate the gift, and especially if you tried it out before passing the judgement that you didnt like it. She was asked if she liked the gift, she gave an honest answer. She didn't just go up to the sis and straight up tell her she didn't like it, the sis asked her if she liked it, she answered honestly without intending to be rude or hurtful. In my book that's more polite than lying and saying you loved something when you actually hated it. I'd  much rather know whether someone actually liked what I gave them or not that way I can learn from my mistakes and get them something they do like next time.", "no-one in their right mind would spend thousands on a party and only include food that the bride can't eat. from other stuff Sister absolutely doesn't seem like a malicious person (with the nice dresses, photoshoot etc) so I have real difficulty believing this posterior comment tbh but I wasn't there I don't know. Moreover,  ANY restaurant would accommodate if told a bride can't eat most of the stuff so they need something else. Nah mate, I don't believe they forced a \"mostly vegan\" to eat fruits.\n\nThe whole situation is such a YTA and bratty behaviour, I can't believe so many people are supporting this bride person. It is actually scary people are this entitled! Poor husband."]}
