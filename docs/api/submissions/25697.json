This weekend we had my bachelorette party and we originally agreed that all \"bridesmaids\" (my best friend (F25) and 3 close friends (M24-27)) would organise it. But I later found out that my sister excluded everyone else bc \"it should be the MOH job\" and just showed up with a fully booked plan before the others could even start discussing ideas.\n\nThe whole party was supposed to be a surprise but I expected that we'd be doing something that they know I'd enjoy. Unfortunately my sister pulled up to some sort of spa and planned to get nails done and some face masks and stuff like that. Afterward we had a private photoshoot with lots of dresses for me - I mean they were georgous but not something I'd ever feel comfortable in. We ended it with a dinner at a fancy restaurant where she preordered dishes that had meat in it. I'm mostly vegan and she knows that.\n\nAll of those were cool ideas and I'm sure many brides would enjoy a bachelorette like that. Hell I'd plan one exactly like that for my sister or best friend but it's just not me. I told her that I hated it but I appreciate that she clearly put a lot of effort and money into the day. The others knew I would't like it so they planned another party yesterday and that one couldn't have been better (we had a medieval dinner at a castle and they booked a cinema where we played video games and drank cocktails the whole day!!) But we excluded my sister and now she's REALLY mad. In fact, my whole family is mad for having a second one and not being grateful for the one my sister planned for me.\n\nI can understand she's hurt and I feel horrible so I consider repaying her the money she spend but I'm not apologising for my interests - shouldn't a bachelorette party be for the bride? And I was just honest when she asked me if I liked it! Even though I do feel like I'm being an ungrateful asshole bc she clearly put lots of effort into planning the day. So any thoughts?\n\nISSUE RESOLVED - read my comment please\n\nEDIT: It's MOH in the title I don't know why I typed that wrong\n\nEDIT 2: Since many asked:\n\n1. I did not choose her as MOH. It's family tradition that the sister takes that role and everyone assumed she would be and I just went with it to make them happy\n2. The 2nd party was secretly planned by my friends after my sister told them she had a plan that was fully payed for without considering ideas or opinions from the others.\n3. I didn't call her to join us because the fight over the 1st party was a few hours prior and I knew that she does not understand my interests. So I didn't want her complaining or us fighting.\n4. English isn't my first language so I'm sorry for using wrong words\n5. \"mostly vegan\": I don't eat meat/fish but I make exceptions for things like eggs/cow milk in desserts, sauces etc.. if I'm eating somewhere that doesn't have vegan options or it would be too inconvenient for the host to provide them. Yes, my sister knows that.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1693208752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163fng0/aita_for_telling_my_f24_mod_f23_i_hated_my/", "score": 7464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not what you would want. NTA. \n\nAlso, IMO, you need to fire her as MOH (and probably as a bridesmaid), because I'd bet a pretty penny that after feeling snubbed by the bachelorette situation she *will* cause drama if she's allowed to make a speech (you also will need to tell the DJ to cut the mic off if she ever gets her hands on it)\n\nETA: You also shouldn't feel guilty about the effort she spent planning. She spent that effort so she could have a day SHE would enjoy. All her reward is in the stuff she got to do that day, and she is entitled to nothing else.", "NTA your sister planned her own hen party.  Also it's not that hard to book a spa and a restaurant. Barely much effort there at all and clearly no thought into what you as a person would want. I'd just tell the family \" am I meant to be thankful that she clearly doesn't know me? Not respects my diet or my friends input?\" I'd honestly also demote her from being MOH at the very least", "NTA\n\nYour sister seriously does not know what your are in to and what you eat?\n\nSounds like she planned it for herself not for you. She planned it without asking you what you want.\n\nGlad the one your friends organised was better, sadly i think your sister is going to be sore about this for quite a while.", "NTA.   \nYou went to HER bachelorette.   \nThen you went to your own.", "NTA. Like the other people in the comments have said she planned a day for HERSELF, not for you. Not only that but she also in doing so showed a very clear disregard for your wishes, dietary preferences, and just overal personality. You told her you didn't enjoy it, you had a party that you wanted to have.\nHas your family told you why they're siding with your sister on this one? Maybe she has told them a version of events that doesn't really add up with what actually happened.", "A lot of expectations flying around here.\n\nYou worded the paragraph on the original party like it was fine, but told her that you hated it. Your sister sounds like someone who\u2019s perhaps not great with EQ (insisting on doing it on her own, organising something that doesn\u2019t take into account your interests), but it doesn\u2019t sound like her intention was to ruin it. It still took effort - something you acknowledged as well.\n\nI\u2019m not sure of the \u2018norms\u2019, but I\u2019d think that if catering to the bride\u2019s wishes is compulsory, the bride should make these wishes explicit. Think of it this way - someone wants to get you a gift for your birthday. You can either let it be entirely up to them, or provide them with a wishlist. Even in the case of the latter, no guarantees, right?\n\nI think the main AH-ish thing your sister did was the inclusion of meat, because it specifically excludes you. That was thoughtless, but that\u2019s about it. In your feedback to her, that should have been included - after thanking her for everything else. \n\nHaving a second party is not necessarily an issue, though it may wound her a little - it\u2019s the exclusion.  You can\u2019t say that it\u2019s a friends-only event either - if I\u2019m not wrong, the participants are the bride + bridesmaids, sans the MOH. It comes off as petty. It reads like a punishment for not planning the ideal party. And if you can\u2019t see that, then you\u2019re simply in the same league as your sister re:EQ issues. \n\nAll this makes me think that yeah, YTA somewhat. Your sister is not exempt from it, but neither are you.", "When you say excluded her, do you mean she wasn't involved in organising the second one or she wasn't even invited to it?", "You're totally right about the Bachelorette party she planned for you.  You have every right as a Bride to have what you want for that.  However I think it was a mistake to exclude your sister from the 2nd party.  I think still inviting her could've been a way to try and keep the peace.", "You had a vegan medieval meal? Or was that one of your not so vegan days of your \u201cmostly vegan\u201d lifestyle?", "ESH. \n\nYou set your sister up for failure a little bit. I\u2019ve been a co-MOH before, and it\u2019s hard enough planning anything with two people, nevermind giving every single person in the party equal input. Nothing would get done. That\u2019s in part why you appoint a MOH in the first place, because someone needs to take lead on making decisions like that. That\u2019s why you appoint someone who really knows you and understands you. \n\nEverything about it being a surprise was also a bad approach. Elements of the bachelorette party can definitely be a surprise, but IMO the bride should provide guidance. \n\nI also think it\u2019s kinda crappy that they didn\u2019t invite your sister to bachelorette party #2. Are they punishing her? \n\nYour sister should\u2019ve taken into account your interests more and definitely your dietary restrictions. But I also feel like you put her in a shitty position, and then punishing her by not inviting her is odd.\n\nETA: people have brought up that OP didn\u2019t appoint her sister as MOH, but that only underscores my second point. If you have someone serving as MOH that you didn\u2019t choose and doesn\u2019t know and/or support your interests, absolutely the bachelorette should not be a complete surprise.", "ESH.\n\nSis sucks for planning her ideal day, rather than yours, especially the disrespectful lack of vegan food at dinner.\n\nYour friends suck for organising a second bachelorette party and excluding her. It could so easily have been just a friends' party, unrelated to the wedding, or branded as further festivities including the MOH, but no, they had to call it a bachelorette party *and* exclude one of the group.\n\nAnd you suck, for not gracefully accepting the day planned by your sister, and going along with the \"alternative bachelorette excluding MOH\" scheme.", "Could've just let her be fr and still involved her I mean she's your sister for crying out loud", "[removed]", "Good grief the whole nonsense around getting married is truly risible", "YTA. Big time. MOH Should have been invited to 2nd Bachelorette party.", "YTA\n\nYour sister doesn't sound like she did that to be malicious. So she got it wrong. If she would like those things, then maybe she thought you would too. She got it wrong, but you handled it poorly. You could have had the day with your friends too. You didn't have to tell your sister you hated something she put so much effort into.  What have you achieved by that? Other than upsetting her unnecessarily.\n\nMaybe I am biased because I like my sisters and appreciate any effort they go to for me, even if it is not exactly what I would choose.  You let it be a surprise rather than getting involved in the planning, so you have to accept it won't be exactly what you would plan if you were involved.", "Your sister messed up but I don't understand why she wasn't invited to the second party? Unless you were planning on keeping it a secret this was bound to cause friction. If she'd have been invited she would have understood what it is that you enjoy surely? Sidenote: isn't a medieval dinner mostly meat!?", "ESH\n\nToo bad you didn't like the party your sister planned. She made an obvious mistake with the restaurant and the activities. But if you want a certain type of hen party you need to be involved when planning the day. If you want it to be a surprise then you can't really complain if the party is not what you wanted. \n\nGood thing you got to have a better party later, but excluding your sister was a d*ck move imho.\n\nHope you have a great wedding :)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It isn\u2019t normal for a MOH to exclude all the bride\u2019s friends from the party planning, to plan a day clearly suited to themselves and not the bride, and to then get upset when you express any discontent over it. It sounds like your sister is incredibly jealous of you and isn\u2019t dealing with your upcoming wedding very well. Have this conversation now before she pulls another stunt at your actual wedding!", "NTA I agree with everyone else do not let her be part of your bridal party or let her near a mic! After reading your explanations/replies OP she will make it about her. You deserve one day focused on your fianc\u00e9 & you \u2026.. despite your sisters tears or tantrums!", "YTA why didn't you invite her on party 2?", "NTA, and maybe the sister isn't an AH too. Maybe she just missed the target, but she did pay for everyone and she did put thought into it so I don't think she acted that way selfishly, at least not entirely. Hate is a strong word, so maybe you could have expressed your feelings with milder words and explain that you wanted one more day of fun, including her. \n\nPs, your second bachelor sounds like a dream one...\n\nEdit to add: I saw in the comments that your friends posted pictures from the second bachelor on social media, while there were none of the first one. That really was a public dig at the sister, since everyone knew she was the moh. I would say YTA for that. Since you excluded her, you should at least have asked your friends to not post anything.", "Your wedding is for you. I\u2019m an old man but feel that the bride should be treated like a princess on all wedding related activities.  You should get what you want.", "YTA. \nYou could have handled this with a lot more grace. Your sister probably didn't realize how much you'd dislike it. She spent a lot of money. She invested a lot of time. \n\nI get it wasn't your thing. Wouldn't have been mine, either. But you should have accepted the gesture and been gracious. Instead, you acted like a preschooler who got a present she didn't like on her birthday. \n\nIf I were your sister, this would be the last time I ever went out of my way to help you. Baby shower? Nope. Birthday party? Nope. In fact, i would probably find a way to have a whole lot less to do with you in general. \n\nAll the NTA comments just confirm to me that Reddit is mostly a conglomeration of spoilt, overgrown 13 year olds. \n\nBTW, if this is how you handle someone's gesture not landing just exactly right, your marriage is going to suck.", "Anyone not saying NTA is probably missing the little part that implies the bridal party *contains several men.* Not to have gendered expectations or anything but I really feel like a spa day with nails and a shoot with a bunch of dresses is going to really suit a male party.", "Why exclude your sister from your second party? I don't blame you for having it, but I think she should have been invited.", "No, not the AH\n\nAt my wedding, she was the MOH.  There was no Bachelorette. \n\nI was a regular bridesmaid at hers.  Oh, and sight unseen, they ordered a bridesmaid dress two sizes too large.  ( I had lost 30 lbs that year. ) fortunately it was a wrap dress, but that only went so far. \n\n Kids were allowed, my daughter was just 2 , and EVERYONE insisted that she be allowed to play with the other two girls, rough tomboy that wound up pushing her into tables.  While I was comforting my very upset toddler, the groom came to get me for photos.  I asked for 5 minutes.  And she was fine after that 5 minutes, but by the time I found them, they were done with the formal photos.  \n\nNot just because of that, but for a myriad of AH behavior on her part, I have been happily  NC for over 20 years.", "I'm hovering between ESH and YTA", "NTA.\n\nShe didn't plan that party for YOU. She planned it for HER. I'm glad your friends planned you something you'd enjoy.", "ESH and at the same time NAH. She tried. She planned, she seemed to invite who you wanted. Did you communicate any preferences in advance? Maybe she wanted to give you something she didn\u2019t foresee you planning for yourself but would enjoy. She didn\u2019t get you the party you wanted, you have every right to plan a second, but to tell her you hated everything and exclude her seems harsh. The party yes is for the bride but also the attendees. \n\nMy sister and I had vastly different ideas of a bachelorette party which likely means our guests did too. We each helped plan parts of each other\u2019s and let other friends do the same for us. \n\nGiving your sister a title and expecting her to know exactly you want are vastly different things. Why take her title away as MOH just because she didn\u2019t do a good job catering to you? This isn\u2019t a job offer  where if she messes up someone\u2019s life is on the line.

I think she wanted to throw you a traditional bachelorette day and she spent a lot of time and money on it. She isn\u2019t like you so doesn\u2019t fully understand your way of thinking even if you have argued about it in the past. She probably thought you would really enjoy it anyway. And she didn\u2019t burden anyone else with paying for it. That was a sisterly live gesture btw. And she should have been included in the other bachelorette party after you should have told her thank you for a lovely day and all of her hard work. Could have just said y\u2019all were having another party while you have the chance. That would have opened her eyes to a different kind of fun and she may have enjoyed it also.", "ESH, she planned her ideal bachelorette for you which is asshole move, but considering you said exclude you didn't even extend the invite to her for the 2nd one. This is asshole too. \n\nIt's okay to not enjoy something but to exclude someone especially your sister over it?", "You're NTA for having and enjoying a 2nd Bachelorette party. But you ARE TA for purposely excluding your sister and seemingly relishing in it. It's just cruel. She's your sister and she tried her best to give you a special day.", "YTA just for telling her you hated it.  And then not even inviting her to the second one.

It sounds like you are a bit different regarding interest and hobbies than the rest of your family?\n\nSomeone said make it drama-free. I highly agree. Just drop the topic, and maybe do these preparations with the dj. There are a lot of people in this sub who want to see drama and heartbreak and divorces and all that.

You\u2019ve left your sister feeling awkward and alienated from the rest of the wedding insiders- or whatever the term is.\n\nAs others have pointed out, by snubbing your sister you are risking drama at your wedding. You suck also for not inviting her to party number 2, and not clearly framing it as an extra party, rather than a replacement party for your sister\u2019s offering. That would have been a more elegant approach to the problem.\n\nYour friends really ought to have put a stop to your sister\u2019s plans, because it\u2019s very clear that they were not a fit for your interests.

That\u2019s just being entitled. She didn\u2019t organize a party for you and spend possibly thousands out of malice but what your friends did and you allowed was purely out of malice.

I'm already having an untraditional wedding so I didn't want to piss off everyone even more but since they are already mad right now - maybe this is actually a good idea? I'd rather have them not be at the wedding than ruin it for everyone who is there. \n\nYou're probably right about it being a reward for her.. she never really gets spa treatments and she's the one who got the most photos taken at the shoot :/ But she essentially paid for everyone not just for her.

She deliberately planned a shower that her sister would NEVER like because she's spoiled, entitled, selfish and had been enabled by their parents their whole lives. My sister knows me backward and forward, and hers does as well. I was raised that no one ever has to do a thing for you so always be grateful, but I was also raised to see selfishness and manipulative behavior for what it is. She knew her sister wouldn't like any of what she planned because she chose her own favorite things (they're basically opposites) so she made sure to pay for it to keep the upper hand. I had two friends in high school who were sisters and two years apart, and when they got angry with each other the younger one would pull the same type of crap. Their mother actually caught on by the time we were almost adults, so the younger one started \"tattling\" to their father because he always took her side. OP mentioned here that her sister was quick to tell their parents but leave out the parts about it being her favorite things and OP's not so favorite things...total manipulative move. Now, I have always had a wonderful relationship with my sisters and would never have left them out of the second party, but I can't say I don't understand why OP did it here. It's possible her other friends eanted her to actually enjoy herself and they knew the sister would ruin all the fun; I'm only assuming because I don't actually know these people LOL. People calling the sisters' planning of the shower a simple mistake are completely wrong; a mistake is something down unintentionally, and based on OP's own words her sister knows her very well and knew she wouldn't like what she planned. What would most of you think if your sister planned an event for you filled with all her favorite things, things she absolutely KNEW you disliked, and it's common knowledge that she's been spoiled and coddled by your parents her whole life and could never stand anyone else getting more of the spotlight than her?

I would also recommend ***privately*** designating an \"Accountabili-Buddy\" for your sister for the evening. That could be a family friend that she gets along with whom you can level with, a couple of friends who can stand her who can tag-team it. You basically want someone whose only responsibility is to intercept her if she becomes \"a problem\". This person needs to be willing to nurse a glass of champagne with her in the bathroom if she wants to cry about how no one told her how pretty she was, you're getting all of the attention, etc.\n\nI'd also suggest doing some mental preparing for how you will deal with whatever she may do. It's your wedding and you shouldn't let you sister be the Sword of Damocles over the entire day If her feelings are hurt because she's a shitty listener/planner.\n\nAgain, sorry you're dealing with this in the dead-sprint that is the week before your wedding.

Some cases actually include very toxic family members (the wedding cake face smasher is one) but most are just like this where the problem also lies in OP\u2019s inability to adequately voice her gut feelings. I\u2019m not judging though because it\u2019s hard for all of us. My wife and I went through the same thing with our wedding but we had to put our foot down eventually ESPECIALLY with \u201ctraditional wedding bullshit\u201d. Again no judgement here. It\u2019s always best to think long term with family.", "You might want to consider telling people your diet is \"plant-based.\" Veganism is an ethical stance that doesn't make exceptions for cravings etc. \"Mostly plant based\" sounds accurate for the way you eat. May be semantics, but will probably promote understanding and be more respected by vegans and non vegans alike.", "OP only makes an exception to eat **vegetarian** (cheese and eggs) when there are no vegan options on the menu. That is NOT the same as serving her a meat dish.\n\nIf you organize a special dinner for someone who eats vegan (or vegetarian) you chose a restaurant that has vegan/vegetarian options. Purposely pre-ordering meat dishes for a vegan because you don't agree with them being vegan is rude and petty.", "Depends on what era, but funnily enough during the rich peoples fad of spiceless food in britain, the poor people were spicing the fuck out of their meat.\n\n\nPoor people could afford meat, but it would be poor quality so psices were heavily used to make up for the shittiness of it.", "NTA. A bachelorette party should be for the bride. Your sister made it about herself, and deliberately refused to let the close friends who know you participate in the planning. \n\nYour friends sound like they really care about you. \n\nDon\u2019t get sucked up into family drama, especially before your wedding. Tell your family you asked her to let your friends plan it. She didn\u2019t, and scheduled things she liked but you didn\u2019t, so your friends kindly threw you a party that was all about what you enjoyed. That\u2019s the end of it, and you won\u2019t discuss it further.", "Yes she planned a Great party\u2026.for herself. NTA.", "Agreed \ud83d\udc4d ESH...you took the words right out of my mouth. I think everyone involved was very immature and, to be frank, acting like children. Everyone was acting entirely in the interests of themselves and their own egos.  Hopefully these girls will take this as a life lesson that, sometimes we need to also think of others and their feelings. Also, being ungrateful under the guise of \"I was just being honest\" is just really cringe. No one is holding a gun to your head and telling you that you have to say EVERYTHING that is on your mind...and if you're going to..maybe think before speaking about how what you're about to say could be taken or how it could affect others.  Did you actually \"hate\" your sister's party? Maybe. Did you need to say that to her? Probably not.", "I agree she already probably felt bad for messing up and got excluded on top of it. ESH", "OP did not handle this with grace. Instead, she chucked a grenade into her family dynamic. \n\nWhen someone gives you a present, even weird, thoughtless, insincere or backhanded presents that don\u2019t fit your tastes, you just smile and say \u201cthank you so much,\u201d because that is basic human decency. \n\nESH.", "Exactly. OP could have done the 2 parties but handled things with more diplomacy. No, being perfectly honest isn\u2019t always the right way.\n\nCould have told the sister she liked a few things on that party but it wasn\u2019t really her interests but appreciated the effort and then had a \u201cgirls night\u201d with her friends.", "You can tell someone you didn\u2019t like something without hating it, so I agree that was rude of OP. I don\u2019t think the friends suck here because they were originally asked to be included and were excluded, so they did their own thing. Maybe they suck for not including the sister in the invite. \n\nI think the only thing that could be described as disrespectful is the meat thing, as far as the original party goes. OP, YTA for not inviting your sister or at least telling her about the second party. She wasn\u2019t being malicious by planning a not great bachelorette party, and It seems like she planned things she actually thought would be fun.", "That! And most people here seem to forget, that it\u2019s a bachelorette. Bachelorettes should be about the bride, not the MOH", "I think it was totally fine for the other bridesmaids to plan a party more to OP's taste and for them to enjoy it, but I don't see why it was necessary for OP to tell her sister she hated the party she planned and paid for or to exclude her from the second party. \n\nIt sounds like OP's sister made some bad choices that were centered on her own tastes, but except for the food choices, which sound a bit shady, it just sounds like the sister is one of those people who has a hard time imagining what someone with different tastes would want. It sounds like she put a ton of effort and money into a party for her sister only to be told her sister hated it and now she's excluded from the group. I'd be devastated if I were the sister.", "A MOH who plans a party the bride will hate is the asshole. Especially when the bride specifies she wants a group of people involved in the planning.", "I'm sorry, but you demoting her is going directly against the advice you're responding to.", "Yes and then OP was the dick for excluding the sis with the other party. That\u2019s what ESH is for, keep up.", "Finally someone with a brain here.", "You forgot OP telling her sister she hated it to her face. If that\u2019s gracious, then you got other problems to tend to", "ISSUE RESOLVED!\n\nThank you everyone for your input - we talked and turns out my sister is jealous bc she's the only one of us siblings not married and her boyfriend is nowhere near proposing. After witnessing 4 weddings in the last years she wanted to feel like a bride too. I should have been able to guess so much since she's been wearing a ring and nothing but white dresses and requested a white bridesmaid dress (not a big deal, mine is not white).\n\nSome of you suggested firing her as MOH, we both agreed that would be the best decision.", "You excluded her from the 2nd party because she threw you a party that you were less than pleased with? Your sister? Uh yeah, YTA.", "YTA for not inviting sis to the second party."]}
