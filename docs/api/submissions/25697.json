This weekend we had my bachelorette party and we originally agreed that all \"bridesmaids\" (my best friend (F25) and 3 close friends (M24-27)) would organise it. But I later found out that my sister excluded everyone else bc \"it should be the MOH job\" and just showed up with a fully booked plan before the others could even start discussing ideas.\n\nThe whole party was supposed to be a surprise but I expected that we'd be doing something that they know I'd enjoy. Unfortunately my sister pulled up to some sort of spa and planned to get nails done and some face masks and stuff like that. Afterward we had a private photoshoot with lots of dresses for me - I mean they were georgous but not something I'd ever feel comfortable in. We ended it with a dinner at a fancy restaurant where she preordered dishes that had meat in it. I'm mostly vegan and she knows that.\n\nAll of those were cool ideas and I'm sure many brides would enjoy a bachelorette like that. Hell I'd plan one exactly like that for my sister or best friend but it's just not me. I told her that I hated it but I appreciate that she clearly put a lot of effort and money into the day. The others knew I would't like it so they planned another party yesterday and that one couldn't have been better (we had a medival dinner at a castle and they booked a cinema where we played video games and drank cocktails the whole day!!) But we excluded my sister and now she's REALLY mad. In fact, my whole family is mad for having a second one and not being grateful for the one my sister planned for me.\n\nI can understand she's hurt and I feel horrible so I consider repaying her the money she spend but I'm not apologising for my interests - shouldn't a bachelorette party be for the bride? And I was just honest when she asked me if I liked it! Even though I do feel like I'm being an ungrateful asshole bc she clearly put lots of effort into planning the day.

Not what you would want. NTA. \n\nAlso, IMO, you need to fire her as MOH (and probably as a bridesmaid), because I'd bet a pretty penny that after feeling snubbed by the bachelorette situation she *will* cause drama if she's allowed to make a speech (you also will need to tell the DJ to cut the mic off if she ever gets her hands on it)\n\nETA: You also shouldn't feel guilty about the effort she spent planning. She spent that effort so she could have a day SHE would enjoy. All her reward is in the stuff she got to do that day, and she is entitled to nothing else.", "NTA your sister planned her own hen party.  Also it's not that hard to book a spa and a restaurant. Barely much effort there at all and clearly no thought into what you as a person would want. I'd just tell the family \" am I meant to be thankful that she clearly doesn't know me? Not respects my diet or my friends input?\" I'd honestly also demote her from being MOH at the very least", "NTA\n\nYour sister seriously does not know what your are in to and what you eat?\n\nSounds like she planned it for herself not for you. She planned it without asking you what you want.\n\nGlad the one your friends organised was better, sadly i think your sister is going to be sore about this for quite a while.", "NTA.   \nYou went to HER bachelorette.   \nThen you went to your own.", "NTA. Like the other people in the comments have said she planned a day for HERSELF, not for you. Not only that but she also in doing so showed a very clear disregard for your wishes, dietary preferences, and just overal personality. You told her you didn't enjoy it, you had a party that you wanted to have.\nHas your family told you why they're siding with your sister on this one? Maybe she has told them a version of events that doesn't really add up with what actually happened.", "A lot of expectations flying around here.\n\nYou worded the paragraph on the original party like it was fine, but told her that you hated it. Your sister sounds like someone who\u2019s perhaps not great with EQ (insisting on doing it on her own, organising something that doesn\u2019t take into account your interests), but it doesn\u2019t sound like her intention was to ruin it. It still took effort - something you acknowledged as well.\n\nI\u2019m not sure of the \u2018norms\u2019, but I\u2019d think that if catering to the bride\u2019s wishes is compulsory, the bride should make these wishes explicit. Think of it this way - someone wants to get you a gift for your birthday. You can either let it be entirely up to them, or provide them with a wishlist. Even in the case of the latter, no guarantees, right?\n\nI think the main AH-ish thing your sister did was the inclusion of meat, because it specifically excludes you. That was thoughtless, but that\u2019s about it. In your feedback to her, that should have been included - after thanking her for everything else. \n\nHaving a second party is not necessarily an issue, though it may wound her a little - it\u2019s the exclusion.  You can\u2019t say that it\u2019s a friends-only event either - if I\u2019m not wrong, the participants are the bride + bridesmaids, sans the MOH. It comes off as petty. It reads like a punishment for not planning the ideal party. And if you can\u2019t see that, then you\u2019re simply in the same league as your sister re:EQ issues. \n\nAll this makes me thing that yeah, YTA somewhat. Your sister is not exempt from it, but neither are you.", "When you say excluded her, do you mean she wasn't involved in organising the second one or she wasn't even invited to it?", "You're totally right about the Bachelorette party she planned for you.  You have every right as a Bride to have what you want for that.  However I think it was a mistake to exclude your sister from the 2nd party.  I think still inviting her could've been a way to try and keep the peace.", "You had a vegan medieval meal? Or was that one of your not so vegan days of your \u201cmostly vegan\u201d lifestyle?", "ESH. \n\nYou set your sister up for failure a little bit. I\u2019ve been a co-MOH before, and it\u2019s hard enough planning anything with two people, nevermind giving every single person in the party equal input. Nothing would get done. That\u2019s in part why you appoint a MOH in the first place, because someone needs to take lead on making decisions like that. That\u2019s why you appoint someone who really knows you and understands you. \n\nEverything about it being a surprise was also a bad approach. Elements of the bachelorette party can definitely be a surprise, but IMO the bride should provide guidance. \n\nI also think it\u2019s kinda crappy that they didn\u2019t invite your sister to bachelorette party #2. Are they punishing her? \n\nYour sister should\u2019ve taken into account your interests more and definitely your dietary restrictions. But I also feel like you put her in a shitty position, and then punishing her by not inviting her is odd.", "ESH.\n\nSis sucks for planning her ideal day, rather than yours, especially the disrespectful lack of vegan food at dinner.\n\nYour friends suck for organising a second bachelorette party and excluding her. It could so easily have been just a friends' party, unrelated to the wedding, or branded as further festivities including the MOH, but no, they had to call it a bachelorette party *and* exclude one of the group.\n\nAnd you suck, for not gracefully accepting the day planned by your sister, and going along with the \"alternative bachelorette excluding MOH\" scheme.", "Could've just let her be fr and still involved her I mean she's your sister for crying out loud", "OMG. You\u2019re such a baby and come off entitled as hell. You\u2019d seriously consider a life altering rift with your sister over a stupid party that is completely unnecessary and self absorbed? You may not be the AH, but you\u2019re a dummy. Get a grip, your focus should be on your MARRIAGE, not the opportunity to make everything about you for months and months. \n\nHave you considered the cost, effort, aggravation, not to mention putting your life on hold just to be in a wedding party? How many events do you need? I almost killed my brother, being his best man cost me $6k, yes, you read that right. There were months of events, which forced me to put my life on hold to cater to this. We had to pull back significantly in other areas to afford this. \n\nGuess what, your wedding is a 6 hour party you should be throwing for your guests, who are traveling, getting hotels and giving you money. Its not an invitation to be a selfish jerk off for a year. \n\nA second bachelorette party? Who are you?

Big time. MOH Should have been invited to 2nd Bachelorette party.", "YTA\n\nYour sister doesn't sound like she did that to be malicious. So she got it wrong. If she would like those things, then maybe she thought you would too. She got it wrong, but you handled it poorly. You could have had the day with your friends too. You didn't have to tell your sister you hated something she put so much effort into.  What have you achieved by that? Other than upsetting her unnecessarily.\n\nMaybe I am biased because I like my sisters and appreciate any effort they go to for me, even if it is not exactly what I would choose.  You let it be a surprise rather than getting involved in the planning, so you have to accept it won't be exactly what you would plan if you were involved.", "Your sister messed up but I don't understand why she wasn't invited to the second party? Unless you were planning on keeping it a secret this was bound to cause friction. If she'd have been invited she would have understood what it is that you enjoy surely? Sidenote: isn't a medieval dinner mostly meat!?", "EHS\n\nToo bad you didn't like the party your sister planned. She made an obvious mistake with the restaurant and the activities. But if you want a certain type of hen party you need to be involved when planning the day. If you want it to be a surprise then you can't really complain if the party is not what you wanted. \n\nGood thing you got to have a better party later, but excluding your sister was a d*ck move imho.\n\nHope you have a great wedding :)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It isn\u2019t normal for a MOH to exclude all the bride\u2019s friends from the party planning, to plan a day clearly suited to themselves and not the bride, and to then get upset when you express any discontent over it. It sounds like your sister is incredibly jealous of you and isn\u2019t dealing with your upcoming wedding very well. Have this conversation now before she pulls another stunt at your actual wedding!", "NTA I agree with everyone else do not let her be part of your bridal party or let her near a mic! After reading your explanations/replies OP she will make it about her. You deserve one day focused on your fianc\u00e9 & you \u2026.. despite your sisters tears or tantrums!", "YTA why didn't you invite her on party 2?", "NTA, and maybe the sister isn't an AH too. Maybe she just missed the target, but she did pay for everyone and she did put thought into it so I don't think she acted that way selfishly, at least not entirely. Hate is a strong word, so maybe you could have expressed your feelings with milder words and explain that you wanted one more day of fun, including her. \n\nPs, your second bachelor sounds like a dream one...\n\nEdit to add: I saw in the comments that your friends posted pictures from the second bachelor on social media, while there were none of the first one. That really was a public dig at the sister, since everyone knew she was the moh. I would say YTA for that. Since you excluded her, you should at least have asked your friends to not post anything.", "Your wedding is for you. I\u2019m an old man but feel that the bride should be treated like a princess on all wedding related activities.  You should get what you want.", "YTA. \nYou could have handled this with a lot more grace. Your sister probably didn't realize how much you'd dislike it. She spent a lot of money. She invested a lot of time. \n\nI get it wasn't your thing. Wouldn't have been mine, either. But you should have accepted the gesture and been gracious. Instead, you acted like a preschooler who got a present she didn't like on her birthday. \n\nIf I were your sister, this would be the last time I ever went out of my way to help you. Baby shower? Nope. Birthday party? Nope. In fact, i would probably find a way to have a whole lot less to do with you in general. \n\nAll the NTA comments just confirm to me that Reddit is mostly a conglomeration of spoilt, overgrown 13 year olds. \n\nBTW, if this is how you handle someone's gesture not landing just exactly right, your marriage is going to suck.", "Anyone not saying NTA is probably missing the little part that implies the bridal party *contains several men.* Not to have gendered expectations or anything but I really feel like a spa day with nails and a shoot with a bunch of dresses is going to really suit a male party.", "Why exclude your sister from your second party? I don't blame you for having it, but I think she should have been invited.", "No, not the AH\n\nAt my wedding, she was the MOH.  There was no Bachelorette. \n\nI was a regular bridesmaid at hers.  Oh, and sight unseen, they ordered a bridesmaid dress two sizes too large.  ( I had lost 30 lbs that year. ) fortunately it was a wrap dress, but that only went so far. \n\n Kids were allowed, my daughter was just 2 , and EVERYONE insisted that she be allowed to play with the other two girls, rough tomboy that wound up pushing her into tables.  While I was comforting my very upset toddler, the groom came to get me for photos.  I asked for 5 minutes.  And she was fine after that 5 minutes, but by the time I found them, they were done with the formal photos.  \n\nNot just because of that, but for a myriad of AH behavior on her part, I have been happily  NC for over 20 years.", "I'm hovering between ESH and YTA", "NTA.\n\nShe didn't plan that party for YOU. She planned it for HER. I'm glad your friends planned you something you'd enjoy.", "ESH and at the same time NAH. She tried. She planned, she seemed to invite who you wanted. Did you communicate any preferences in advance? Maybe she wanted to give you something she didn\u2019t foresee you planning for yourself but would enjoy. She didn\u2019t get you the party you wanted, you have every right to plan a second, but to tell her you hated everything and exclude her seems harsh. The party yes is for the bride but also the attendees. \n\nMy sister and I had vastly different ideas of a bachelorette party which likely means our guests did too. We each helped plan parts of each other\u2019s and let other friends do the same for us. \n\nGiving your sister a title and expecting her to know exactly you want are vastly different things. Why take her title away as MOH just because she didn\u2019t do a good job catering to you? This isn\u2019t a job offer  where if she messes up someone\u2019s life is on the line.

I think she wanted to throw you a traditional bachelorette day and she spent a lot of time and money on it. She isn\u2019t like you so doesn\u2019t fully understand your way of thinking even if you have argued about it in the past. She probably thought you would really enjoy it anyway. And she didn\u2019t burden anyone else with paying for it. That was a sisterly live gesture btw. And she should have been included in the other bachelorette party after you should have told her thank you for a lovely day and all of her hard work. Could have just said y\u2019all were having another party while you have the chance. That would have opened her eyes to a different kind of fun and she may have enjoyed it also.", "ESH, she planned her ideal bachelorette for you which is asshole move, but considering you said exclude you didn't even extend the invite to her for the 2nd one. This is asshole too. \n\nIt's okay to not enjoy something but to exclude someone especially your sister over it?", "You're NTA for having and enjoying a 2nd Bachelorette party. But you ARE TA for purposely excluding your sister and seemingly relishing in it. It's just cruel. She's your sister and she tried her best to give you a special day.", "YTA just for telling her you hated it.  And then not even inviting her to the second one.

It sounds like you are a bit different regarding interest and hobbies than the rest of your family?\n\nSomeone said make it drama-free. I highly agree. Just drop the topic, and maybe do these preparations with the dj. There are a lot of people in this sub who want to see drama and heartbreak and divorces and all that.

You\u2019ve left your sister feeling awkward and alienated from the rest of the wedding insiders- or whatever the term is.\n\nAs others have pointed out, by snubbing your sister you are risking drama at your wedding. You suck also for not inviting her to party number 2, and not clearly framing it as an extra party, rather than a replacement party for your sister\u2019s offering. That would have been a more elegant approach to the problem.\n\nYour friends really ought to have put a stop to your sister\u2019s plans, because it\u2019s very clear that they were not a fit for your interests.

That\u2019s just being entitled. She didn\u2019t organize a party for you and spend possibly thousands out of malice but what your friends did and you allowed was purely out of malice.

I'm already having an untraditional wedding so I didn't want to piss off everyone even more but since they are already mad right now - maybe this is actually a good idea? I'd rather have them not be at the wedding than ruin it for everyone who is there. \n\nYou're probably right about it being a reward for her.. she never really gets spa treatments and she's the one who got the most photos taken at the shoot :/ But she essentially paid for everyone not just for her.

Why the fuck does it have to be perfect? Why tell her you hated it? And why so bad you exclude her for your \"redo\"?\n\nJesus, it's like she gave you a gift that took a lot of effort and you broke it in front of her. Then went out and had fun deliberately without her. \n\nAre *you* the shitty sister? Because I'm not seeing much to counter that.", "it's bc it's not about the activities. It's about taking the spotlight off her sister & making her feel less-than on her special day. massive power play.", "Agree totally. Reading tales like these \u2026 and there are many on this site \u2026 I wonder what kind of home training these brides had. Talk about   Whiney Little Girls. I pity their future partners.", "I agree. There\u2019s tons a of people that can\u2019t afford just the one party, let alone two.   Also, why not just call the second party a social outing with friends instead of calling it a bachelorette?", "How is she an infant for thanking her sister but not enjoying the actual activities? You don't enjoy things that you don't enjoy, it's pretty simple. The only thing I'd say she could have done differently is to invite her sister to the 2nd party.", "Woah. This is some solid advice!\n I think I can use this strategy to deal with rifts I have with family :)", "It\u2019s nice to see this perspective about it\u2026 so many people find that once they are in their 30s, their friends have become distant acquaintances, and their once distant siblings have become their best friends.", "This is excellent advice", "Yeah I\u2019m having a hard time with these \u201cfire her immediately\u201d posts. She, as you said, made a self centered mistake. Is that seriously worth continuing drama? If OP believes sister to be someone who is going to make some huge scene, okay I guess (although if she\u2019s that crazy she\u2019s going to do it anyway), but there\u2019s nothing in the post to indicate that\u2019s the type of person sister is. Planning a party she would like but not OP so much is not enough to demonstrate she\u2019s going to start ranting in her MOH speech.", "Those are vegetarian not vegan. Vegans are are pretty strict and if you deviate you are not a vegan. Veganism is a lifestyle while vegetarian is a diet.", "This. OP is \u201cmostly \u201c vegan. That\u2019s their personal approach and probably not very clear to others what they will or won\u2019t eat. Saying that though, vegetarian dishes would be better than chancing meat food for a \u201cmostly vegan\u201d.", "Turnips", "Then that's not vegan.", "We never had a particularly good sibling relationship but it's not like she always went against my wishes. She's the youngest of 5 kids so my parents did everything to not make her feel neglected - she's just kinda used to getting things her way. She was the type of kid that got presents at someone else's birthday party to stop her from crying.", "I can't believe the responses. I've given away both my daughters, and know first hand how entitled brides can behave. \n\nReddit and other platforms appear to promote and condone this rude and selfish behaviour.", "How could OP include the MOH in thr second party when she wasn\u2019t involved in the planning of that party either? And if you\u2019ve read her other comments, her sister always critisized what she likes and does, like being vegan, so how could a mostly meat dinner not be intentional when she made fun of OP for being vegan? \n\nI would not be grateful if someone spend my bachelorette party to have their own dream party while knowing that I would dislike most of the activities. Luckily, if I were to get married, my sister and friends would plan something I actually liked, instead of doing something that they liked while knowing I\u2019d dislike it.", "When people stop acting like narcissists ill consider it", "Definitely the best advice I have seen", "There are different types of vegan and different reasons people adopt a vegan diet. It\u2019s a lifestyle for some but some just apply it to food. Some apply it in all aspects of product consumption. Gatekeeping doesn\u2019t encourage others to try it.", "I was talking about mostly vegan. There are people that are mostly vegan\ud83e\udd37", "Goats", "Oh in that case yeah absolutely don't let her get anywhere near the mic on the wedding like the others have said.\nThat also instantly explains why your parents are taking her side, it's not that you were ungrateful but you weren't satisfied with your sister getting the party she wanted on a day that should be about you.\n\nAlso, if I may pry a little,if your relationship was never that good why make her the MOH?", "So she's the baby, the princess, the special one...", "Oh, so she's always got what she wanted, and she never had to consider other's feelings or interests. Time for her to grow up and realize she's not the sun.", "What? Are you dense? How does OP invite their sister to an event?\n\n*in walks op*\n\n>hey sis I just thought you should know some of the other bridal party planned a medieval dinner and a night out. Just wondering if you wanted to tag along?", "I explained that in a reply but long story short: It's a family tradition that the sister is MOH so everyone just expected it. I never even thought about this not being a possibility nor did I asked her to be MOH. She's my sister so she's MOH by nature.", "Oh I hadn't seen that reply. Honestly I think it's somewhat questionable to have her just slide into the role without you asking it even with the precedent there. It still should've been on you to ask her because you are more than just one of the family but your own person, something your sister very clearly doesn't see you as considering her opinion that her party was good because those are things you /should/ like."]}
