We arent sure who left it and it had been there for 3 months and no one asked about it yet alone claimed it and my manager was getting ready to throw it out so it wasn't taking up so much space. I ended up taking it home, washing it, and it became my favorite scarf. I just had someone this week come up and say it was their scarf. I gave it to them without a fuss but they made a massive deal about me stealing it and even said it was knit by their mom. They even made a post on the local Facebook about how my company steals lost items. Am I a asshole for taking a scarf home when no one claimed it for 3 months? Should I just have let it get thrown out instead?", "created_utc": 1671800583, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zteqdj/aita_for_taking_home_a_scarf_that_was_lost/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They had plenty of time to have asked at the reception if their scarf was found... And you returned it as soon as the person claimed it was theirs. NTA at all. Your manager was going to throw it out anyway. In a way, it's because you rescued it from being thrown out, that the original owner could get it back. They should actually thank you.", "NTA. If an item is left for three months without reclaiming it, it is reasonable for you to take it home with you. Especially since it is just a scarf, not something worth a lot of money. Furthermore you did well returning the item when the legal owner asked it back. It\u2019s however not okay the way they treated you after the fact.", "Nta\n\nCan't be that important if they didn't bother asking for 3 months. That person was just desperate to start drama.", "NTA  \nCall them out on their post", "NTA - Her making a fuss after not claiming it for three months and then posting that your  \"company steals lost items\" tells me *she* is the AH.", "NTA\n\nMany places in fact, have a policy of \"if it isn't claimed in a certain period of time, it is considered abandoned\". Sounds to me like 3 months would be considered to be an abandoned item.", "NTA and you were kind to give it back after 3 months. I'd respond to their message with who leaves things for 3 months and expects them back?", "\"They made a big deal about me stealing it and even said it was a knit by their mom.\"  \n\nIf it was such a \"big deal\", why didn't they pick it up sooner? \n\nNTA", "NTA, lost & found is a month. If you haven\u2019t come back for it after 3 months it\u2019s not your item anymore", "NTA, they would have never found it again had your manager thrown it out, now would they? Not to mention that would be a huge waste of a nice scarf. Whoever claimed it from you made no effort to find it, I question how much they care or whether they even know your workplace has a lost and found, either way the lack of situational awareness is concerning", "NTA it\u2019s not your fault someone lost an item that was supposedly very important to them at the time of being left behind. It\u2019s ideal that a person should want to reduce, reuse, recycle, rather than add things to landfills while buying new items. while I don\u2019t blame the person for being sad about their scarf and wanting it back, them blaming you for theft Instead of taking accountability for them losing their own stuff is unfair and so rude", "NTA, 3 months is long enough and you returned it with no complaints. Your company is not a storage facility, they can come get their stuff or at least call to say they are looking for it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You waited three months to take it home in the first place. Unless there was a tag with the owner's contact info on it, I don't see how you're at fault at all. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nIf the scarf was that important to her, why wouldn't she check lost and found in the first place", "NTA- It was lost for 3 months. You took it because it was unclaimed. Once the owner identified themselves, you gave it back.", "Lol NTA. If anything that person is a moron.", "Indeed, it was so important, why did they leave it for 3 months and you're the only reason it's not in the landfill?", "The only reason I can think of,  is that they didn't know where they had left it,  and only realised when they saw OP wearing it. \n\nOP still NTA"]}
