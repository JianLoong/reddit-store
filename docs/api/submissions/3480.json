My sister(29) promised she'd take her daughter, Kay(10), to Urban Air one week after her birthday.\nTwo weeks after Kay's birthday, Kay asked me if I wanted to go there with her. I say sure since my sister has no car and I knew I'd be the one taking everyone there anyway.\n\nYesterday she calls me with her moms phone to ask if I'd \"go with\" her. And if you know my sister and niece, you'd know that anytime Kay calls someone, it's bc her mom handed her the phone and okay'd it. And more than likely TOLD Kay to ask for something.\n\nThat little detail is important bc when I get there, and wait for them to get ready. My sister says \"yall have fun.\" I do a double take and watch her boldly lie to my face as she pretends she didn't tell Kay to call me to ask me to go. She acted like it was all my idea to take her. And she made excuses about having pregnancy cramps and pains as to why she was staying.\n\nI was really annoyed that she dropped her child on me when I only expected to be the ride and not the baby sitter. But I tried to make sure my sister wasn't also trying to throw the cost on me. I asked her how much it costs and she says, \"idk exactly but Kay has the required socks and I gave her $10.\"\n\nThis is part of the reason imbta. I accepted that answer without being absolutely sure. But keep in mind, my sister knew enough to know it had required socks. She also described it in the past as a place with bouncy castles. I've never been on a bouncy castle that costs money, so $10-20 sounded normal for that.\n\nWhen we leave in the car, I question my niece and confirm that my sister DID, in fact, tell her to ask me to take her. But after more questioning, I realize Kay purposely used the wording \"go with me\" instead of \"take me.\" So my niece was complicit in the manipulation.\n\nI told her that she shouldn't have tricked me like that but still decided to take her since she'd have no other way to go.\n\nWe get there and I ask Kay to give me the $10 so I can pay. She says that her mom gave it to her for buying snacks. Wow. I didn't want to take her snack money so I looked at the prices inside before deciding to take the money. As soon as I get in there, I realize this is going to cost way more than $10. There are no bouncy castles. There are huge trampolines and indoor playground stuff. The way the place is layed out, there is no place for me to watch Kay without entering and having to pay. And since my brother tagged along, I'd have to pay for him as well. The 3 of us would've cost around $90.\n\nI was halfway through adding my info when something inside me broke. I just said lets go. I was seething with anger that my sister tricked me into this and my niece tried to trick me too. I brought her back home and just left after taking her all the way there. My niece has been crying about it and I know my sister made me out to be the villain. My mom is taking my sister's side. And although I think my sister is mainly at fault, i want to know if my reaction was justified or if I'm the AH.

NTA.\n\nThe aholery of your sister is screaming out from the page; your actions are completely reasonable... and yet I understand why you are asking (which, BTW, also shows how decent a person you are). You are asking because your family is full of aholes, who try to blame you when you stand up to their manipulations. A clear sense of right and wrong have not been modeled in your family, so you are still susceptible to their manipulations.\n\nFor your niece, who is still pretty young, and is sadly influenced a lot by her mom, you can do two great things for her.

Tell her that you understand her mom is teaching her to trick people into giving/doing things to get what she wants, but you need her (your niece) to learn that that is not OK. You can explain that you can't afford that trampoline park expense any more than her mother can, that even if you could have, if wasn't right to try and corner you into giving far more than you were planning to give/do for her birthday. The gifts you are giving your niece are the best things in the world: letting her know you love her and modeling right and wrong for her.\n\nAt this point in life, your sister is probably a lost cause. No need to debate it with her. You know she intentionally tried to trick you into this. Your guard is up against future manipulation. When she does manage to trick you in the future, this incident is a great model for how you handle those moments. You walk away - even if it's embarrassing or sad for a third party (like your niece). Don't let your sister use your care for others to force you into doing things you don't want to do.\n\nYour mom's enabling of your sister is probably a bit of how your sister adopted her approach to life. You don't need to debate anything with your mom, either. If she wants to pay for/do something your sister was tricking you into doing, she can have at it. But she has no say in what boundaries you uphold for yourself.\n\nGive yourself a pat on the back! You handled this well.

How about today we all go get an ice cream now and we'll plan another day to come back?\" Then once you're with your sister again, have the conversation that you feel manipulated, etc. Thankfully kids are very forgiving but I imagine you hurt your relationship with your niece.

Yes, in the end part of my anger was towards my niece, but it was the fact that my sister lied to me and the fact that my niece was expecting this as a gift from my sister, and not me, that made me decide to leave.", ">What\u2019s funny is he admits that there is a clear difference between those two things. Yet keeps trying to play this silly \u201csHe MaNiPuLaTeD mE\u201d nonsense. \n\nThat supposed to be a contradiction?\n\n>Not to mention if he truly thought that he was just the ride, why did he bring the other brother? Dude\u2019s full of it.\n\nSo I thought I wasn't going to pay for myself to be with my niece. So... me bringing my 15 yr old brother who I also thought wouldn't have to be paid for as he wasn't going to be jumping on a bouncy castle somehow makes my story untrue? Make it make sense", "I'm not putting it onto the child. It was the mom who put this all in motion. \n\nThere would be no need for paying for myself or for my neice if I'm just tagging along with them. As I could've just waited in my car or drove somewhere else for a while, while my sister payed for her and her daughter's entry and watched her child like a person who \"takes\" a child somewhere.\n\nYou're saying that conflating \"go with me\" and \"drop me and mom off\" is dumb bc I know the difference between \"go with me\" and \"take me.\" \n\nThat does not make any sense at all. In order for that to make some semblance of sense, YOU have to be comflating \"drop me and mom off\" with either \"take me\" or \"go with me\" in your head. \n\n>it\u2019s a dumb one because you yourself acknowledged that there is a CLEAR difference between those two asks.\n\nI never acknowledged a difference between \"drop me and mom off\" and \"go with me.\" Just \"go with me\" and \"take me.\"\n\n>She called and asked you to GO WITH HER. Nowhere did she say \u201cdrop me and mom off\u201d. That\u2019s an assumption you made\n\nThe fact that you are criticizing me for conflating 2 things that you claim I had a distinction between means thay you are conflating \"take me\" and \"drop me and mom off.\"\n\nThat does not make any sense at all. Don't call me dumb", "You wrote a long bunch of nothing. \n\nIf someone says \u201cgo with me\u201d then they are not asking you to just be the ride, especially if it\u2019s a child asking. Hearing \u201cgo with me\u201d and thinking it means they\u2019re asking you to just be the ride IS dumb.", "You seem to have a hard time remembering some key details. It was her mom's idea. She told Kay to call me.", "So why are you so convinced that Kay purposefully tricked you?"]}
