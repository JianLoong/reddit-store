My sister(29) promised she'd take her daughter, Kay(10), to Urban Air one week after her birthday.\nTwo weeks after Kay's birthday, Kay asked me if I wanted to go there with her. I say sure since my sister has no car and I knew I'd be the one taking everyone there anyway.\n\nYesterday she calls me with her moms phone to ask if I'd \"go with\" her. And if you know my sister and niece, you'd know that anytime Kay calls someone, it's bc her mom handed her the phone and okay'd it. And more than likely TOLD Kay to ask for something.\n\nThat little detail is important bc when I get there, and wait for them to get ready. My sister says \"yall have fun.\" I do a double take and watch her boldly lie to my face as she pretends she didn't tell Kay to call me to ask me to go. She acted like it was all my idea to take her. And she made excuses about having pregnancy cramps and pains as to why she was staying.\n\nI was really annoyed that she dropped her child on me when I only expected to be the ride and not the baby sitter. But I tried to make sure my sister wasn't also trying to throw the cost on me. I asked her how much it costs and she says, \"idk exactly but Kay has the required socks and I gave her $10.\"\n\nThis is part of the reason imbta. I accepted that answer without being absolutely sure. But keep in mind, my sister knew enough to know it had required socks. She also described it in the past as a place with bouncy castles. I've never been on a bouncy castle that costs money, so $10-20 sounded normal for that.\n\nWhen we leave in the car, I question my niece and confirm that my sister DID, in fact, tell her to ask me to take her. But after more questioning, I realize Kay purposely used the wording \"go with me\" instead of \"take me.\" So my niece was complicit in the manipulation.\n\nI told her that she shouldn't have tricked me like that but still decided to take her since she'd have no other way to go.\n\nWe get there and I ask Kay to give me the $10 so I can pay. She says that her mom gave it to her for buying snacks. Wow. I didn't want to take her snack money so I looked at the prices inside before deciding to take the money. As soon as I get in there, I realize this is going to cost way more than $10. There are no bouncy castles. There are huge trampolines and indoor playground stuff. The way the place is layed out, there is no place for me to watch Kay without entering and having to pay. And since my brother tagged along, I'd have to pay for him as well. The 3 of us would've cost around $90.\n\nI was halfway through adding my info when something inside me broke. I just said lets go. I was seething with anger that my sister tricked me into this and my niece tried to trick me too. I brought her back home and just left after taking her all the way there. My niece has been crying about it and I know my sister made me out to be the villain. My mom is taking my sister's side. And although I think my sister is mainly at fault, i want to know if my reaction was justified or if I'm the AH.

I mean, I'm not counting your brother since they didn't obligate you to do that, but they clearly intended that you would cover the child and yourself -- that seems to be about $60, right?\n\nThey're *using you* for money and car rides.\n\nThis is bullshit.\n\nNTA.\n\nIf it were me, I'd be really nervous to trust them again.  Once the kid starts lying too, it's all over.  There isn't a trustworthy person to... trust.  You'll get lied to from every direction, and they'll both try to fool you.\n\nI think I'd just stop coming around so much.", "NTA. \n\nYou can pay for only the kids to jump at the park while you stay on the sidelines. \n\nBut even still, they both manipulated you so that your sis didn't have to go. If she didn't want to go then she shouldnhave just said so in the beginning and asked if you would be willing to take her, and then watch her. \n\nShe knew how much the park cost if she already had the socks. She just didn't want to pay for it. I mean it took 3 weeks to even get you to take her daughter to the park, she was never going to do it. \n\nYou need to call your sister out for lying and trying to manipulate you into paying to take her kid to the park, because she didn't want to. \n\nYou also need to call your mom out for defending your sister for lying to you instead of being straight up honest and giving you the money for it. \n\nYou need to remind them that it wasn't your responsibility to take or even pay for your nice to have fun. That's for her mom to do.", "NTA. She promised Jay and then shoved that onto you.", "Wow. NTA.\n\nThe aholery of your sister is screaming out from the page; your actions are completely reasonable... and yet I understand why you are asking (which, BTW, also shows how decent a person you are). You are asking because your family is full of aholes, who try to blame you when you stand up to their manipulations. A clear sense of right and wrong have not been modeled in your family, so you are still susceptible to their manipulations.\n\nFor your niece, who is still pretty young, and is sadly influenced a lot by her mom, you can do two great things for her. Take her out for a treat like an ice cream or a burger and for a chance to chat. Tell her you love her as your niece; you wanted to do something nice for her birthday and this is the treat you would like to give her. Tell her that you understand her mom is teaching her to trick people into giving/doing things to get what she wants, but you need her (your niece) to learn that that is not OK. You can explain that you can't afford that trampoline park expense any more than her mother can, that even if you could have, if wasn't right to try and corner you into giving far more than you were planning to give/do for her birthday. The gifts you are giving your niece are the best things in the world: letting her know you love her and modeling right and wrong for her.\n\nAt this point in life, your sister is probably a lost cause. No need to debate it with her. You know she intentionally tried to trick you into this. Your guard is up against future manipulation. When she does manage to trick you in the future, this incident is a great model for how you handle those moments. You walk away - even if it's embarrassing or sad for a third party (like your niece). Don't let your sister use your care for others to force you into doing things you don't want to do.\n\nYour mom's enabling of your sister is probably a bit of how your sister adopted her approach to life. You don't need to debate anything with your mom, either. If she wants to pay for/do something your sister was tricking you into doing, she can have at it. But she has no say in what boundaries you uphold for yourself.\n\nGive yourself a pat on the back! You handled this well. You have a chance to be a really good influence and lightpost for your niece (and save her from following in her mom's footsteps). You are exercising your boundary-enforcing muscles. Take a moment to feel good about yourself!!", "NTA. \n\nBeen there a few times and also felt that sudden shift when you realise you\u2019ve been done over and don\u2019t want to play along anymore. You were tricked and manipulated. Yeah you could have looked at the information beforehand and maybe would have done if you were the one planning the day out. Being asked to come along implies the planning part is done. You said your mother is taking sister\u2019s side, does that happen often? Is it a family trait that\u2019s rubbed off on your sister or are they taken in with your sister\u2019s lies?", "NTA. Next time you know to just say no up front.", "NTA, if your sister wanted you to take Kay, she should have paid.  Yes, you were going to be stuck with the bill.", "Your sister sounds unhinged and full of drama, and apparently doesn\u2019t believe in personal responsibility. Honestly I\u2019d just go LC/NC. No one needs that kind of manipulative person in their life.", "Stop doing nice things for your sister. Your sister is not a nice person and will just use you.\n\nIf you want to do nice things for your niece, do it on your time with your arrangements. Tell her \"I am doing X, if you would like to come too then I would love to have you along.\" If you are making the arrangements then it's less likely that things will be sprung on you.", "Yeah when sis starts acting dumb that's when you have to press harder. Like when she said she didn't know the cost to enter but she gave her daughter 10$. That's when you say, \"ok well when you figure it out let me know\". Or\" let's call the place and find out\". Do not fall for that\"I didn't know\" b.s.", "Yup. Wonderful parenting, isn't it?"]}
