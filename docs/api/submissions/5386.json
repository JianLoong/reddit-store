And pressuring someone at 20 years of age (or any age really) is selfish. Mom is the selfish one here. You are the one thinking responsibly.", "NTA. This is a super toxic family system and your mother is clearly very much a part of it, even if she's also a victim of it. It is not your responsibility to carry on a family line and you should absolutely not have children if you don't actually want them and feel willing and able to take on that responsibility. Choose your own happiness, safety, wellbeing and fulfillment and never make big life choices like having children in order to make someone else happy.", "NTA! Your life, your decision.", "NTA. Your family is forcing some weird and outdated views about child bearing on you and that's not cool. Your brothers can go ahead and give her grandchildren if it's so important to them with out infringing on your right to choose how you want to live your life.

As a woman you must have children and get married to be happy?!?! I thought we were in 2022 not 1822 your dad is an AH.

It is your life do not let them or anyone else pressure you into having children if you don\u2019t want them.", "NTA. I feel like all this drama is just a deflection from the original issue, which was your mother asking how you\u2019d treat her if she ever started acting like HER mother. The easiest thing right now would be to agree that you\u2019re still very young (true), you have lots of time to enjoy your life (also true)\u2014but meanwhile, your mom needs to learn better boundaries when it comes to dealing with her family.", "You have no way of knowing if you will be happy with children or not. With that said, your life is your own. You\u2019re not obligated to have children for anyone\u2019s sake, not even your future partner\u2019s. \n\nInfo: how come your brother can\u2019t have children?", "NTA. As a woman in my 30s who has always known I didn\u2019t want kids, I feel your pain. Prepare for a *lot* of people to have opinions about your decision to remain child free. They will try guilting you, coercing you, bribing you, shaming you. They will try to invoke fear of loneliness, or that you won\u2019t find love if you don\u2019t want kids. None of this is true. Stay strong and don\u2019t let anyone force you into something you do not want. \n\nYour mom is an AH for trying to force you to have kids for her \u201clegacy\u201d. You are a human being, not a tool for her to use. You get to make your own choices and she needs to respect them. If she doesn\u2019t then she runs the risk of losing you. That\u2019s on her. Also, she has other kids who WANT kids, so she will still get to be a grandma. But it\u2019s gross to look at grandkids as \u201clegacy\u201d instead of as humans that you have the privilege of knowing and raising and loving. \n\nYour brothers are AH for not standing up for you. They are your moms kids and can provide her the grandkids they seem to think she deserves. Also for calling you selfish. Not wanting kids isn\u2019t selfish. It\u2019s self aware. Your mom forcing you to have kids you don\u2019t want is selfish.\n\nYour dad is an AH for his sexist, outdated attitude that women are only good for marriage and childbearing. Statistically happiness increases with marriage for BOTH men and women, but not by a huge amount, so his idea that women need it is baseless and sexist. Furthermore, childfree people actually rate higher in happiness over their lifetimes than parents. So again, he is wrong and sexist. \n\nYou are young and you *might* change your mind as you get older\u2026 nothing in life is 100% certain and humans are ever changing creatures. But you *might not*. I haven\u2019t changed my mind and the older I get the more certain I am of my choice. \n\nYour wants for your own life are more important than anyone else\u2019s. Having kids is a lifetime commitment that affects you body, your mental health, your finances, your time\u2026 the list goes on. No one else gets to make that decision for you. The best advice I can give is to also be VERY up front and honest with anyone you date. I told my boyfriend on our second date that I never want kids. I told him if that was something he wants then it was nice meeting him. His exact response? \u201cI\u2019m 24, I don\u2019t know.\u201d So I told him fair enough, but I\u2019ll likely never change my mind so if it\u2019s something he decides is important for him then he MUST tell me. And I was, and still am, willing to walk away despite being together for nearly a decade. Differences on wanting kids isn\u2019t something you can work through. It\u2019s a fundamental incompatibility. Keep that in mind. \n\nStay strong, you\u2019re in the right with your family and totally NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt is entirely your choice in life whether to have children or not, as ultimately it will be you carrying them, minding them, spending the majority of 18 years + pouring every second of the day into their wellbeing.\n\nYou've got clear reasons for not wanting them, as is your right, and constantly asking you to put aside those reasons just to help keep someone else happy is insensitive, selfish and hurtful to you and your wishes.  \n\nHaving kids purely to keep a bloodline alive is idiotic. And you mention you have brothers, surely this sole responsibility of passing on the genes does not fall to you? \n\nI would wonder if her severe response to this is partially because of how she has been treated by her family, taken advantage of, used and disregarded. She has (incorrectly) taken this as a way where she can get some control and get what she wants for once?", "You're NTA, everyone else in your family is. Why can't your brothers continue the bloodline?", "NTA your family has really outdated views. If your brothers are so concerned about your mom\u2019s dreams of grandchildren, then they can be the ones to procreate and give her some. \nYou don\u2019t need to have children to be happy and fulfilled as a woman. Some people do, but a lot of people also have children because they think that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do when perhaps it\u2019s not the best choice for them. Sounds like you\u2019ve considered it carefully and will make the right choice for yourself. Plus the bloodline thing is a bit weird in my opinion, you can have a family that isn\u2019t biologically related to you and still have strong bonds and legacy with that family.", "NTA. Putting a child in the world only for the sake of bloodline is selfish. Does any of your brothers annoying you have children of their own already? Why it's only your responsability to give your mom grandchildren?\n\nYou are right OP if you don't want kidsfor whatever reason don't let anyone pressure you in to it.", "Your NTA. However, you are reliant on your family for support so I would tread carefully.   I wish your mom would respect your wishes but it sounds like she won't.  If she brings it up have you considered just saying you want to concentrate on school now? At least until you are independent and out of the house.", "NTA, tell your brother's to gift her with as many grandchildren as they choose and you're out, period.", "Your mom asked if you would cut her out if she acted like her mother.\n\nThe time to cut her out is NOW.

And it would be doubly cruel to a child to be unwanted by their mother.", "If you don't want kids that fine and as a man I think it's entirely fair to not want to do childbirth, that sounds pretty crazy to willingly go through. But it's also true that you might change your mind as you age. I was dead set against kids as a teen for instance. Now at 33 with a stable job, a wife, and a house, well I'd like 1 maybe 2. \n\nIf you told 16 year old me that was my future I'd have been pissed lol", "NTA. Nothing wrong with being selfish about your happiness ( as long as you\u2019re not hurting anyone).", "My mother used to do this to me, and I never did have kids. (I'm 48 now.) And I don't regret it. My siblings both had children, but for some reason me refusing to have them despite my mother hating being a mother just pissed her right off.   \n\n\nI'm not going to make myself miserable just because she did.", "They mean you adding the kid thing. But I don't really see that as piling on as much as giving things that would cause you to do cut her out. Which is reasonable.", "Of course you'll manage. Look for online options too. Many offer sessions after the last two years, and it's better to talk in another language than not get help at all."]}
