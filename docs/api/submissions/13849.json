I know it's weird, but it's just something I've always struggled with. My sister and I got into a big argument about it, with her accusing me of being selfish and ruining her special day. My parents also got involved, but I refused to take off my shades.\n\nDuring the party, I kept my sunglasses on the entire time, even during the traditional father-daughter dance. My sister was visibly upset and didn't want to take any pictures with me. After the party, my parents sat me down and told me that I had been disrespectful to my sister and that I should have taken off my sunglasses for her special day. They said that it wasn't about me and that I needed to learn to put others first.\n\nI still feel like I was in the right for not taking off my sunglasses. It's not like I was wearing a hat or anything else that would have been considered disrespectful. It's just a personal preference and I don't think I should have to change who I am for someone else's event.

I don't really understand why so many people are certain that wearing sunglasses is some dramatic scene-stealing, inherently upsetting thing. It's not like you weren't wearing trousers or something. I also see a lot of commenters who are assigning different intentions to you than what you've said, and I get it that unreliable narrators are a thing and it's not like I haven't thought that before about other AITAs but I'm inclined here to take you at your word that you have a genuine fear of people being able to see your eyes, and that it genuinely makes you feel vulnerable. I feel like sunglasses should be seen as a relatively unobtrusive solution to help you able to engage more confidently in important events whilst you're dealing with this social anxiety, and I'm gonna say I feel quite sorry for you that your family seem to have gone straight to anger and discipline without having empathy with the fact that you are trying to find a coping mechanism for a struggle that is clearly really present in your life and social interactions. I don't think that's fair. It was a big day for your sister but unfortunately when you have an anxiety disorder or a phobia, that still exists and it still needs coping with on big days.\n\nIt sounds to me like the sort of 'eyes are the windows to the soul' rhetoric has really got in your head, so for what it's worth, I think there's a lot more poetry in that idea than fact. People can't tell who you are or what your thinking, or even necessarily what you're feeling, from your eyes. The fact is eyes are pretty and (for neurotypical people) something people are often programmed to look at to establish an interpersonal focus or highlight an interaction, e.g. to say 'I am listening to you now \\[as opposed to focussing on what's happening out the window\\]', so because people develop their opinions on someone \\*though interactions\\* there's a tendency to completely over-romanticise how much the eyes that they were looking at had to do with developing those opinions. As far as my observations go, your personality and emotions come out in your brow and your shoulders and your hand gestures and voice as much as, if not more than, your eyes, and people just can't tell your thoughts from the outside. If you want a suggestion, maybe look into taking up some acting classes or workshops or looking up tips on stuff like that online - just for that body language awareness - so you can feel in control of what your body language is communicating to people instead of feeling anxious that you're communicating your inner world without wanting to (you're probably not, but I know firsthand that irrational anxiety is a bitch - and anything that increases your confidence and the feeling of control you have over your level of vulnerability seems like it could be a good shout).\n\nI think you can probably see from the comments that despite it literally being a small harmless article of clothing, lots of people have hang-ups and pre-decided connotations about sunglasses. That is really their problem, but I guess you could take from that that if your anxiety is about being \\*judged\\* rather than about being vulnerable then something else might be a more effective coping mechanism.\n\nBest of luck. This does sound like a kind of social anxiety to me and that shit is difficult, especially with family who don't get it. I really believe one day you'll be able to feel more confident about this and interacting with people without sunglasses will feel okay :).

I read this as social anxiety possibly from neurodivergence, so many people think he's the AH for not masking and acting \"normal\" and it makes me cringe to see people assuming the worst. I'm on the spectrum and I totally get how eye contact can be incredibly uncomfortable. Personally I would've taken the shades off long enough for photos, but overall this wasn't that big of a problem. I just think OP should seek counseling since this is clearly a problem for him.", "This is it for me exactly. I want to vote NTA because it seems misunderstood that the dude doesn\u2019t like people looking into his eyes. People are taking it as some MIB \u201cyou can\u2019t read me, I\u2019m too cool\u201d, when it can honestly be that he\u2019s neurodivergent or sensitive to intimacy or feeling vulnerable for some deeper reason. \n\nMy friend used to get mad at me when I didn\u2019t take my prescription shades off in the mall, that cashiers would think I\u2019m rude (she was a cashier and it was her opinion), but my eyes are really sensitive to light and I get aural migraines. Not to mention my sensory issues, which then enhance the light in my eyes issue. Maybe people need to be more understanding of everyone\u2019s individual needs and not expect people to be uncomfortable for them because they don\u2019t like the aesthetics. Like don\u2019t take it as rude because someone has sunglasses on in your store? It\u2019s a bit weird to me.", "No, not really. I'd think it was odd but I wouldn't really care", "Before I was diagnosed I couldn't really put a finger on where the overwhelm was coming from and chalked it up to a small social battery.\nI wouldn't be surprised if OP has the same issue of not knowing what is making him uncomfortable and blaming it on the most obvious thing to him.", "Omfg thank you. I don't wear sunglasses often because I forget them everywhere. But Florescent lights are the Bain of my existence. I can't even handle the ceiling fan lighting in my house", "Coddling your child's mental disability at a young age only sets them up for failure in adulthood. Should my son inherit my ADHD or his mother's GAD it's my goal to teach him how to manage the disorder through the available methods. Even meds if required, but I WILL NOT require society to conform to my child and just enable ineptitude. That's just hurting him more", "Why is that also exactly where my brain went lol", "Agreed. In general, \"very online people\" are often ND. (Including me.)", "but why?", "This is why online school during the pandemic did not work.    Most of the kids got behind because they need the interaction and needs I teacher that is there physically.      Some some kids did okay with it, but there were others that could not keep up or basically, stopped getting on a computer.    There was a girl from my state that did a online school about 10 years ago, she graduated from high school at 12 and was given a full ride scholarship and several Ivy League schools.", "why do you wear a shirt?", "Semi off topic but similar, my mom has a story about this old country singer asking her on a date during/after a concert because he saw her in the crowd or something. This would\u2019ve been back in the 60s-70s if it happened. I\u2019m not 100% sure but it might\u2019ve been Conway Twitty? I could be wrong, I\u2019d have to ask her, and it\u2019s 6 am rn. Anyway, whoever it was, she turned him down lmao.", "Different cultures have different norms. Manners are set by the group not the individual. Whether op intends to be rude or not is irrelevant. If you\u2019ve had multiple people say please don\u2019t do x it\u2019s rude and then you still do it. You\u2019re an AH. You can\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t know it was rude because you\u2019ve been told. It doesn\u2019t matter if you as in individual think something isn\u2019t rude because it\u2019s others perception of what is rude that\u2019s important socially. \n\nWe\u2019re social animals at the end of the day so if you don\u2019t conform to the group you\u2019ll be othered. And for something as silly as wearing sunglasses inside it\u2019s a weird hill to die on over 1 night", "It was rude because his sister (who\u2019s special day it was) asked home not to.", "Wearing sunglasses *inside* is usually rude.", "Yep, lots of way people learn to mask outside of therapy. Abuse is an obvious one; those masking conversion camps are still a plague.\n\nI'm 100% not condoning that, just agreeing with the other commenter about how masking doesn't indicate neurotypical.", "warmth?? idk", "He hasn't seen anything in many years, but to be fair, coffins are dark.", "Ok, but not it's not horrible to make autistic people look others in the eye? You know, the activity that is so uncomfortable that it can break some people down mentally to the point where they stop functioning and have meltdowns? \n\nTo describe what eye contact feels like to me... have you ever been touched by a creep against your will? Or been fixed to the spot by the gaze of a predatory animal? I'd describe it as not quite that bad, but definitely the same kind of feeling. It's gross. It's invasive. It's such a private thing. \n\nAnd ND want me to meet the eye of everybody I meet, so I won't be rude to THEM, but they completely neglect to figure out what they're asking of ME, or consider if it's rude to ME to make me do this. You would not be comfortable with people touching you without your permission, no matter how much society said it's polite to let them. So let us have our space without judging.", "It's not just effort. ND people seem to think it's just a 'try little harder' thing, as if it's like lifting weights and you can lift the heavier one just fine if you just push a bit more.\n\nBut the truth is, eye contact is often just creepy. It's like a mix of the feeling you get when you're pinned to the spot by a predatory animal looking at you like food, and that of an unwelcome touch from a creep. Maybe not that bad (for me personally - others have it much harder to the point where it causes meltdowns, let me repeat that in different words, it is so awful and overwhelming that *people break down because their brain can not process the experience*), but definitely that kind of feeling.\n\nEye contact is eldricht horror. Something just on the edge of my brains ability to compute.\n\nIt's something exposing. Something I'd feel comfortable doing only in very intimate relationships, intimate not as sexual but as in people you could allow really close and personal to who you are. With children, with animals, with the select few lovers you'd feel comfortable and secure with even if they asked to hold a knife to your throat.\n\nYour neurological wiring interprets eye contact completely different from ours. Do not judge people for what is 'rude' or 'horrible to do to people' when someone lives in a completely different sensory reality but are trying to accomodate the majority anyway, even at their own expense. People are trying. But many autistic people live in an eldricht world, one full of eyes, each eye a path to madness, regardless of your intentions or ours. Give us a break.", "What a great story! I lived in Australia then and saw that tour in Sydney. I was so excited to see him, and then he only played for like 30 minutes."]}
