I know it's weird, but it's just something I've always struggled with. My sister and I got into a big argument about it, with her accusing me of being selfish and ruining her special day. My parents also got involved, but I refused to take off my shades.\n\nDuring the party, I kept my sunglasses on the entire time, even during the traditional father-daughter dance. My sister was visibly upset and didn't want to take any pictures with me. After the party, my parents sat me down and told me that I had been disrespectful to my sister and that I should have taken off my sunglasses for her special day. They said that it wasn't about me and that I needed to learn to put others first.\n\nI still feel like I was in the right for not taking off my sunglasses. It's not like I was wearing a hat or anything else that would have been considered disrespectful.
