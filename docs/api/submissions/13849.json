I know it's weird, but it's just something I've always struggled with. My sister and I got into a big argument about it, with her accusing me of being selfish and ruining her special day. My parents also got involved, but I refused to take off my shades.\n\nDuring the party, I kept my sunglasses on the entire time, even during the traditional father-daughter dance. My sister was visibly upset and didn't want to take any pictures with me. After the party, my parents sat me down and told me that I had been disrespectful to my sister and that I should have taken off my sunglasses for her special day. They said that it wasn't about me and that I needed to learn to put others first.\n\nI still feel like I was in the right for not taking off my sunglasses. It's not like I was wearing a hat or anything else that would have been considered disrespectful.

Why are people so mad about someone wearing sunglasses inside? Like... Why would anyone actually care?\n\nIt's definitely weird OP wants to wear sunglasses so often, but isn't it also just as weird for the family to care so much? \n\nI feel like blue hair would be just as attention grabby, but I bet if that was the question people would say \"she should learn to accept it\".\n\nIf OP was following social conventions other than wearing sunglasses the family, and everyone here, is making waaaaay to big a deal about this.\n\nNTA", "You're getting a lot of... harsh? comments here, and I'm going to risk it and say NTA. I don't really understand why so many people are certain that wearing sunglasses is some dramatic scene-stealing, inherently upsetting thing. It's not like you weren't wearing trousers or something. I also see a lot of commenters who are assigning different intentions to you than what you've said, and I get it that unreliable narrators are a thing and it's not like I haven't thought that before about other AITAs but I'm inclined here to take you at your word that you have a genuine fear of people being able to see your eyes, and that it genuinely makes you feel vulnerable. I feel like sunglasses should be seen as a relatively unobtrusive solution to help you able to engage more confidently in important events whilst you're dealing with this social anxiety, and I'm gonna say I feel quite sorry for you that your family seem to have gone straight to anger and discipline without having empathy with the fact that you are trying to find a coping mechanism for a struggle that is clearly really present in your life and social interactions. I don't think that's fair. It was a big day for your sister but unfortunately when you have an anxiety disorder or a phobia, that still exists and it still needs coping with on big days.\n\nIt sounds to me like the sort of 'eyes are the windows to the soul' rhetoric has really got in your head, so for what it's worth, I think there's a lot more poetry in that idea than fact. People can't tell who you are or what your thinking, or even necessarily what you're feeling, from your eyes. The fact is eyes are pretty and (for neurotypical people) something people are often programmed to look at to establish an interpersonal focus or highlight an interaction, e.g. to say 'I am listening to you now \\[as opposed to focussing on what's happening out the window\\]', so because people develop their opinions on someone \\*though interactions\\* there's a tendency to completely over-romanticise how much the eyes that they were looking at had to do with developing those opinions. As far as my observations go, your personality and emotions come out in your brow and your shoulders and your hand gestures and voice as much as, if not more than, your eyes, and people just can't tell your thoughts from the outside. If you want a suggestion, maybe look into taking up some acting classes or workshops or looking up tips on stuff like that online - just for that body language awareness - so you can feel in control of what your body language is communicating to people instead of feeling anxious that you're communicating your inner world without wanting to (you're probably not, but I know firsthand that irrational anxiety is a bitch - and anything that increases your confidence and the feeling of control you have over your level of vulnerability seems like it could be a good shout).\n\nI think you can probably see from the comments that despite it literally being a small harmless article of clothing, lots of people have hang-ups and pre-decided connotations about sunglasses. That is really their problem, but I guess you could take from that that if your anxiety is about being \\*judged\\* rather than about being vulnerable then something else might be a more effective coping mechanism.\n\nBest of luck. This does sound like a kind of social anxiety to me and that shit is difficult, especially with family who don't get it. I really believe one day you'll be able to feel more confident about this and interacting with people without sunglasses will feel okay :).

I actually used to do something similar with my own shades, I am diagnosed as autistic and eye contact is, just a bit too aggressive. Thats a pretty common experience. I never did anything like this, but I bet there's someone out there who would struggle much harder with sustained eye contact. \n\nRates of autism are going up, and  there are a lot of new factors in our health profiles and environment that likely attribute to that. It's not that rare, and I'm sure lots of people unintentionally act like assholes because of a developmental disorder that can impact their ability to parse social situations", "Yeah that's true if you either ignore the word \"maybe\" or don't know what \"maybe\" means.", "So why would you disregard his whole section about how he has struggled with eye contact and feels uncomfortable about having his face/eyes read. What about that leads you, someone who works extensively with neurodivergent people assume that this means he\u2019s tHE AH? This parts reads like a cry for help. These things are symptoms of things like Autism and ADHD C, he needs to be seen because this could be something else too. You, as a professional, cannot and should not throw down a judgement like that, something OP might read, especially if he is neurodivergent.", "Sorry, meant to respond to the same person you were responding to, not to you!! Oopes....", "Agreed! If it\u2019s not, it\u2019s at least some kind of social anxiety that probably makes him bad with crowds either way. I also have a feeling he didn\u2019t really communicate his reasoning to his family. From personal experience, that can also be a pretty tough age for anxiety; I remember struggling with the idea of giving anyone potential leverage over me. Like, if someone flirted with me, I basically asked myself why they were trying to manipulate me lol.", "I'm just explaining what's going on in people's heads when they deem that behavior rude. Maybe you could think of a polite way to address it if they seem awkward or put off, like, \"Thank you for your hospitality! I hope you don't mind if I keep my hat/shades/coat on.\" \n\nIt's like how different houses and social circles have different opinions of wearing your shoes inside. Some people think it's rude to track in the dirt from outside on your shoes; other people think it's too intimate and taking advantage of their hospitality to take your shoes off. It's not like one feeling on it is right or wrong; they're just different feelings", "Happy to blame them for raising a shitty kid", "nah they just made everyone think he was blind.", "It helps when you have a talent as the focus. Sunglasses just enhance the effect lol.", "I don't give a shit about why is behaving the way he is. The explanation OP gave was that it is a PERSONAL PREFERENCE!!!! Can't you read weirdo??? Nowhere did OP state that his behavior is abnormal, or how ND might play a role in his life. So stop giving advice where it is not needed. OP doesn't even show remorse for doing what he did. Even if he did have issues, that is grounds for being an asshole. \n\nLike I said, what is your vote? NTA, YTA, ESH, or not enough info? Do not give advice on this sub. It is not what it is here for. It is to judge people. That's it.", "My parents taught me how to fake eye contact as a kid since both me and my younger brother, who is diagnosed autistic, tended to avoid it. Look at their ear or just over their shoulder about ear height. It's close enough to the eyes that nobody notices that you're doing it. \n\nMy best friend had no idea I've been faking it for the 11 years we've been friends until I told her a couple of months ago.", "They rule it out as in they do not put it into the judgement. They don't rule out the possibility itself, they just don't say \"because that is a possibility I judge it milder,\" while they would put an actual diagnose into it.", "He hasn\u2019t been diagnosed with anything. He\u2019s an asshole and so are you. Enjoy your evening!", "OP sounds like an ass. But I am confused about how his sunglasses drew anyone\u2019s attention from a girl in a giant dress who is obviously the center of the party. This seems like two kids taking themselves too seriously.", "I thought so, but I was worried I was rude accidentally.", "He hasn't said anything inherently shitty. I think he genuinely doesn't understand and struggles socially. Yes there could have been compromises but the parents had an all or nothing approach with no actual attempt to explain options, to maybe OP hasn't been taught about negotiation and working towards a compromise.", "if this is your standard for calling people shitty I imagine you started searching what retirement home to put your parents into the first time they hit you as a kid , it doesn't have to be that deep man.", "You clearly can\u2019t read the fact that OP is most likely undiagnosed. People don\u2019t normally wear sunglasses 24/7 and the fact that they are should probably alert that something is off. No normal 17 year old, not matter how ugly they are, hides their face like they are Medusa. OP is NTA and needs to see a psychiatrist.", "First off she was at her quince so that\u2019s not taking herself too seriously. The whole event is about her. She\u2019s the center of attention. What about that is taking herself too seriously?\n\nSecond he sat inside with sunglasses on the entire time. It drew people\u2019s attention. Maybe not a whole lot from her but he said he doesn\u2019t like for people to stare. So he\u2026puts in sunglasses inside? People will stare.", "Nope, sorry about that. \n\nLooks like I'm stuck with some down votes for that mistake. Lol", "You're as big of an asshole as him, enabling his behavior. It is not your place to diagnose him. And really? NO single 17 year old in insecure about their eyes??? They teach you to make baseless assumptions in med school? Stop with the bleeding heart and save it for your own patients."]}
