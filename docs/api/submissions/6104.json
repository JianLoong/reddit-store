I thought my share was my house, electricity, water, drinking water, gas and stove, cooking oil, RICE, and toiletries for 6 people. (I\u2019m in Asia, inflation is crazy high right now). I fed them a total of 3 full meals (dinner, breakfast, lunch) plus 2 small afternoon meals (sandwiches, noodle soup). I even cooked chicken and pasta, bought chips, drinks, and cupcakes with my own money. Before leaving, they brought with them the leftover groceries (hotdogs and half loaf of bread) and got some takeouts (pasta and cupcakes). I got so offended, I told my partner I would never host for them again or even see them again. She said what happened is the norm and expected of being a host. 5 of the 6 friends have jobs and money is not a problem since they were willing to pay for a hotel room in the first place.

It\u2019s a planned overnight so they had time to pack and prepare their things. They have jobs too so money isn\u2019t tight for anyone. \n2) I might be the asshole because my gf said what happened was expected of being a host and that being the host doesn\u2019t excuse me from giving a share for groceries.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How tacky of them.", "NTA! Whenever we\u2019ve gone to visit friends and stay with them we pay for everything, do all of the cooking and cleaning and leave them everything extra! Funny thing, we are also grateful during and after and make sure to express it. Why does your gf think it\u2019s ok for her friends to treat you and your home like this. Show her this thread. Her friends are out of line and she is T A for not correcting them! I wouldn\u2019t let them stay ever again either. In the future, be sure to stand up and say nope. I get you wanted to keep the peace but allll of the nope applies here.", "NTA! How very disrespectful! I think your partner should tell them off for being lousy guests. Not only because of the money (Already stupid and abnormal) but *at the very least* for not even thanking you \ud83d\ude12  how disappointing. Please do not accept this again in the future. I think it was graceful of you to pay up and not make a scene. But the way they behaved was totally wrong", "NTA. They are the AH. They should have asked you if you wanted to contribute towards groceries and not made the decision for you. They abused your hospitality. 10/10  would never host these kind of people again. You are not their butler or hired help.", "This was just posted an hour ago?", "NTA", "NTA ~~YTA~~\n\n~~None of you made your expectations clear upfront. Next time agree on these things beforehand.~~\n\n~~Banning your partner's friends is an excessive over-reaction. You learned a lesson about planning ahead and communicating clearly, and it was a fairly cheap lesson too. But if you want to learn a bigger, more expensive lesson too...~~\n\nSince there were clear expectations upfront of what their responsibilities were\u2014and because they did not live up to those responsibilities\u2014I now think your are not the asshole, and that they are the assholes.

That is not how hosting goes when you have considerate guests. Yes, you do cook and provide toiletries, etc. As a guest, I would bring groceries to be considerate, but would never ask the host to pay for any of it and would leave the leftover groceries unless there were things the person doesn't like/won't use.", "NTA.\n\nWhen guests stay over, they should always take the host out for at least one meal to repay the kindness.  Preparing a very nice meal out of groceries they bought is also acceptable.  If it's more than a night or two, they should offer to help restock the fridge as well.\n\nThese people were rude and entitled, to put it politely.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is the worst offender, by saying what they all did is ok ie you\u2019re wrong to be miffed and expecting it should be allowed again.  You hosted, provided food, lodging, invasion of your home and all personal spaces and supplies, etc and they actually asked you for a cash contribution to the few meager supplies they brought and never thanked you? Nope", "NTA.  That is not how hosting goes.  Your gf's friends are greedy and entitled.

NTA \ud83d\ude2d", "I had a similar experience though it was my best friend and her bf.  They stayed at our house for 3 nights, I did all meal preps daily.  Her bf said he would prepare us a meal the one night, took him to grocery store, got up to the till, I assumed he was going to pay for the food but nope he walked away from the register so I ended up paying for it.  The meal sucked btw, he was just so cheap during the whole visit, \n and it's not like he was broke, he was an engineer living at home with his folks.  Went out for dinner and yes we paid for them.  Went to our mutual friends wedding and I paid for their hotel room.  My best friend wanted to buy 1 round of drinks at the wedding and he tried to convince her otherwise. Due to that experience and other situations I am no longer in contact with her.  This was over 10 yrs ago.  Your gf needs better friends.  NTA", "In light of this new info, I've updated my opinion to NTA.", "I think you need to have a serious discussion with your \"partner\". Specifically talk about the agreed upon rules (that you wrote above) and the unwritten rules. Because if s/he thinks this is \"normal\" behavior, you will have problems throughout the future whenever anybody visits you, whether invited or not, and when you visit others, such as family, for holidays, celebrations, etc. For the record, this is NOT typical behavior in the US. Guests offer to help clean, contribute to meals, treat their hosts to dinner (or an alternate meal), thank their hosts, and bring a hostess gift, although the latter protocol is going by the wayside. These people would not be invited back to my home, either.", "that's a good lesson for the future, but I can absolutely see OP being shocked and just paying up in the moment.", "Oh no you\u2019re right I didn\u2019t think of that. I just wanted to get it over with because they\u2019re not good company either. They barely talked to me, they mainly talked to each other about their past staycations. I felt so left out the whole time", "Yes ofcourse that's a good point. It's not easy to think of these things in the moment if you haven't experienced it before!", "Well, at least you now know what they are like, and if you stick to not allowing them over again, you won't have to worry about it happening again in the future \ud83d\ude0a."]}
