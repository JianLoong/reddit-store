I got so offended, I told my partner I would never host for them again or even see them again.

Your girlfriend is the worst offender, by saying what they all did is ok ie you\u2019re wrong to be miffed and expecting it should be allowed again.

Her bf said he would prepare us a meal the one night, took him to grocery store, got up to the till, I assumed he was going to pay for the food but nope he walked away from the register so I ended up paying for it.  The meal sucked btw, he was just so cheap during the whole visit, \n and it's not like he was broke, he was an engineer living at home with his folks.  Went out for dinner and yes we paid for them.  Went to our mutual friends wedding and I paid for their hotel room.  My best friend wanted to buy 1 round of drinks at the wedding and he tried to convince her otherwise.

Specifically talk about the agreed upon rules (that you wrote above) and the unwritten rules. Because if s/he thinks this is \"normal\" behavior, you will have problems throughout the future whenever anybody visits you, whether invited or not, and when you visit others, such as family, for holidays, celebrations, etc. For the record, this is NOT typical behavior in the US. Guests offer to help clean, contribute to meals, treat their hosts to dinner (or an alternate meal), thank their hosts, and bring a hostess gift, although the latter protocol is going by the wayside. These people would not be invited back to my home, either.", "that's a good lesson for the future, but I can absolutely see OP being shocked and just paying up in the moment.", "Oh no you\u2019re right I didn\u2019t think of that.

It's not easy to think of these things in the moment if you haven't experienced it before!", "Well, at least you now know what they are like, and if you stick to not allowing them over again, you won't have to worry about it happening again in the future \ud83d\ude0a.", "NTA  These guests invited themselves to your home and then asked for payment for crap groceries? Don't ever let them come back and personally I would not speak to them ever again.", "NTA. They don't seem like nice guests. No need to have them back again", "Simple answer to this.  If this is what is expected from the host, tell your partner that you choose not to be the host in the future.  No explanations or recriminations needed.  Your partner knows you were upset and invalidated your feelings.\n\nSo if it comes up again, say no thank you. If they want to use your house again, only allow it if they pay your your hotel stay or go and spend the night with a friend or relative.\n\nNTA, but don\u2019t let yourself be put in this situation again or you would be the TA to yourself.", "NTA, I would not allow those people in my house again.

I wouldn't host them again.", "NTA Your girlfriend was the one hosting HER friends in YOUR home. They were rude guests, and you owe them nothing, especially not a return visit. They can book a room next time and she can visit with them without you. Consider it a lesson learned and move on without allowing them to return.", "I act the exact same way whenever I go to my friends house. If I have the time or extra money I\u2019ll buy them a gift too. I argued with her about this and she kept telling me that\u2019s how hosting goes.

The vibe I\u2019m getting from this is that she cared for feelings more than yours", "And they took my leftover pasta and cupcakes home too! \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0", "I'd bet that when they are at their own homes, they buy groceries, prepare meals, and clean up after themselves. If not, they need to bring their housekeepers with them when they visit.", "She apologized and paid me back the $5 lol \ud83d\ude44 I told her though that I would NOT host them again, no matter what. They weren\u2019t good company either", "This seems stupid but I spent a lot of time making it and I thought I could rest from cooking after they left and just the reheat the leftovers.", "That sucks! \ud83d\ude41 I\u2019m so sorry to hear that!

I\u2019m surprised that she\u2019s taking their side as well. I lived in Southeast Asia for 20 years and US for 9 years. Both places have the same rules of etiquette (gifting the host, offering to clean up, contribute to gifts, personally saying thanks). I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s telling me what I know isn\u2019t the norm??", "The first hint was them inviting themselves over instead of a hotel room.

Where I come from the burden is more on the guests to be respectful of their hosts. The phrase \"not allow her friends to come over\" is kind of a red flag however. Not enough context is given for this to really know. I'd be offended too, but you should also be considerate and try to facilitate your partners social life.", "NTA \n\nDO NOT LET THESE PEOPLE INTO YOUR LIFE AGAIN! They are users, the fact they didn't help in anyway during the time.  If I were you I'd unfriend them on fb & Instagram and never interact with them again. \n\nThey're your partners friends not yours, you don't need to maintain this relationship, let her manage the friendship separately from you.", "Your girlfriend is trying to make excuses for their behavior and disrespecting you in the process. It could be that she's covering up her embarrassment, but doesn't want to jeopardize the friendship with her rude friends. Why she would want friends like that is beyond me. She doesn't have your back here. This is so not the way it works. One HONORS the host and behaves as a guest, not the master of the house.", "You should make a comment on the picture saying \"it was great having you over! Glad we all had a good time, happy to host you\" or something passive aggressive like that. Even thought it's not true, it's a great opportunity to call them out while not calling them out.\n\nObviously NTA.", "As compared to the cheapskates who stayed for free at your place and had the nerve to demand money from you???", "Wow that\u2019s insane. Had they ever hosted you or ever paid for single thing for you? I cringed at the idea of him walking away at the till. Very embarrassing. I can\u2019t understand how people are like this ..!!", "Wow I feel like you understand *exactly* how I feel. I\u2019ll show her your comment because that\u2019s \ud83d\udcaf what I\u2019m thinking.
