It's been an emotional roller coaster, and only a handful of close family and friends knew about it because I didn't want to jinx it until everything was final.  \nMy older sister, let's call her Emma, got engaged around the same time I started the adoption process. Our family has been thrilled, planning for her big day next summer. Emma's always been the type to love attention, but I've been supportive and helped with preparations whenever I could.  \nThis past weekend, I received the final confirmation: the adoption had gone through, and I was officially going to be a mom. Overjoyed, I wanted to tell my family in person, so I thought our regular Sunday family dinner at our parents' house would be perfect.  \nWell, as it turns out, Emma had a similar idea. She planned to announce her wedding venue and date at the same dinner without telling anyone.  \nThe dinner started, and everyone was in good spirits. Before I could share my news, Emma stood up, clinking her glass for attention, and beamed as she revealed her wedding plans. Our family burst into excited chatter, and in that moment, I felt like my news could wait until later in the evening, or even another day.  \nBut then, my mom, who was one of the few who knew about the adoption, gave me a knowing look and mouthed, \"Now's the perfect time!\"  \nCaught up in the emotion and encouraged by my mom's enthusiasm, I stood up and announced, \"And I have some news too\u2014I'm going to be a mom! The adoption is final!\"  \nThe room erupted. Half the family rushed towards me, showering me with congratulations. But when I looked at Emma, her face had fallen. She excused herself from the table and didn't return for the rest of the evening.  \nAfter the dinner, my parents and several relatives said that while they were happy for me, I should have waited and not \"stolen Emma's thunder.\" Emma texted me saying I was an asshole for upstaging her on purpose and that I could have chosen any other day to announce my news.  \nMy intention wasn't to overshadow her announcement, and now I feel torn up about it. Emma and I haven't spoken since, and the family is divided on whether I was insensitive or if it was just an unfortunate coincidence.  \nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for sharing my adoption news on the same night as my sister's wedding venue announcement?", "created_utc": 1699085316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ngxmp/aita_am_i_the_asshole_for_upstaging_my_sisters/", "score": 4666, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even though it wasn't premeditated, I shared my news immediately after hers, which divided the family's attention and made some relatives accuse me of trying to upstage her on what was supposed to be her special moment. My actions directly affected my sister, leading to her feeling overshadowed and upset during a time that was meant to be dedicated to her and her fianc\u00e9. Emma's accusation and her hurt feelings have caused me to think that perhaps my timing was insensitive, and I should have waited for a more appropriate moment to announce my own good news.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Venue reveal? Seriously? The only response to someone telling you the venue for a wedding is 'oh that sounds nice.' It's not something to 'celebrate' or go huffy over if someone else has even better news. It's barely even news! And your parents are being as ridiculous as your sister. She's not a child - although throwing a temper tantrum over this does make you wonder - and indulging her over this makes them as silly as she is.\n\nWedding culture has been an out of control monster for a long time with the most idiotic behaviour being excused because 'she's a bride' but I think your sister has managed to find a new low and your family are utter clowns for indulging her in this nonsense.", "NTA. A venue reveal isn't a thing.  It doesn't need a full on announcement beyond being on the invitation. I'm afraid I don't think I'd be able to take it seriously if someone did a venue announcement. That's full on princess behaviour", "Your mums the Arsehole \n\nShe\u2019s backtracked and dumped you in the shit \n\nI can understand getting caught up in the excitement. Besides it\u2019s not like she\u2019s announcing the engagement. It just a where and when. Since when is that a big fanfare. She\u2019s an arse too for expecting everyone to fawn every minute detail of her wedding. Not everything needs an announcement. That\u2019s going to get very boring.", "NTA.\n\n>After the dinner, my parents and several relatives said that while they were happy for me, I should have waited and not \"stolen Emma's thunder.\"\n\nReally?

Half the family rushed towards me, showering me with congratulations.\n\nIf she didn't want you to do this and the others thought you were wrong to do it, they've got extremely unusual ways of showing it.\n\n>Emma texted me saying I was an asshole for upstaging her on purpose and that I could have chosen any other day to announce my news.\n\nYes: you're adopting a child to steal attention from her.", "NTA. The idea that the announcement of a wedding date and venue is something that deserves its own celebration is absolutely ridiculous. An engagement, yes. You\u2019d have to be quite egotistical to think that her  having decided on a date and location is as important as you becoming a mom.", "NTA, 'venue reveal' is a new celebration I'm not sure should become a thing.", "What thunder is there to steal with a \u2018venue reveal\u2019?\n\nAdoption finalized >>>> venue reveal\n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you announced it at her wedding - she doesn\u2019t have monopoly over what family news is allowed to be shared at family dinners. People who think everything related to their choosing to get married is more important than everything else in others lives shit me to tears.", "NTA - I hate the false equivalency here. Becoming a mom and setting a date (for a wedding everyone knows is coming) are not equal announcements. Your sister should have been happy for you\u2026.because this is huge. Congratulations.", "NTA She didn't announce her engagement, she announced the venue and date. Given that everyone knew she is getting married next summer, that's only a little more thunderous than announcing what's she's picked for the entr\u00e9e. And a family dinner is low key enough that sharing good news isn't like announcing it at her engagement party or shower. What's up with your mom though, urging you to share the news than scolding you for doing do?", "NTA congrats on adoption news\nThis was not upstaging your sister, this was not announcing her engagement, this was purely her saying she\u2019s set a date.", "Wait? So your mom told you to announce and then after told you you should have waited, on the contrary I think your mom would be in the wrong here as she should have told Emma she encouraged you to share the news and we can all be happy for everyone. NTA.", "If it was the wedding yes.\nBut it was just wedding plans. They were already engaged, so the wedding news itself wasn't new. It's just about organization. \nNTA.\nAnd btw I find a new child in the family definitely more exiting news than a venue for a wedding.", "NTA - adopting a baby is more important than where or when you\u2019re getting married.  \nI understand an engagement announcement but anything else is info not an announcement.", "Emma is a massive, childish asshole, who should probably know by now that her damn marriage party isn\u2019t the only thing that matters. She should have been elated. Her wedding coming up, and now she gets to be an aunt?? I\u2019d be stoked and so excited to share that moment with everyone I love\u2026\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not even like this was her engagement announcement. This wasn\u2019t the \u201cmom, dad, we\u2019re getting married!\u201d dinner.

Not a celebration!", "Oh good lord, what is this obsession with Brides needing the spotlight and attention constantly? If I was your sister I'd have been thrilled for you as you have been with her big events. There's enough love and attention for more than one person at a time. Sister needs to grow up a bit.", "First and foremost, I am genuinely moved and grateful for the congratulations and support regarding my adoption news. The journey to parenthood has been a deeply personal and transformative experience, and to have it recognized so warmly means the world to me.  \nI read through each comment and felt a swell of appreciation for the candid perspectives shared. It\u2019s clear that the dialogue here isn't just about assessing who might be wrong or right, but about understanding the complexities of family dynamics and the weight of personal milestones.  \nTo those who expressed that my sister's reaction and my family's indulgence may be excessive, I understand where you're coming from. Modern wedding culture can indeed seem overwhelming at times, and the expectation for each event to be grand can detract from what truly matters\u2014the love and union of two individuals.  \nHowever, I also recognize that for my sister, her wedding preparations are a major life event, and I can empathize with her desire to have a moment in the spotlight for her venue reveal, no matter how grand or modest it may be. While the news of my adoption is a joyous occasion, I could have chosen a different moment to share it, allowing her the full attention for her announcement that she had hoped for.  \nCommenters who highlighted the backtracking of our mother and the challenges this has posed, your points are well taken. It\u2019s been a learning moment for me about the importance of clear communication and respecting the boundaries of each family member\u2019s special life events.  \nI want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed their opinion with such passion and honesty. Your engagement with my story has offered me new perspectives and taught me the importance of timing and sensitivity in sharing my own happiness, especially in the context of another's special moment.  \nIn the spirit of family and unity, I am reaching out to my sister to apologize for any hurt I may have caused. My intention was never to overshadow her; rather, it was an overflow of excitement that I now see could have waited for a more appropriate time.  \nFamily is about love, support, and understanding. The love I've seen here, even amidst differing opinions, has reminded me of the beauty of that bond.  \nThank you all once again for your support and for providing a space where we can learn from each other.", "My sister did her \"venue reveal\" on WhatsApp. There was no fuss over it as it's really not a big deal. You had news actually worth attention. NTA.", "Weird that you say your mom encouraged you but that then your parents were critical. Makes the whole story seem off.", "NTA. Announcing an engagement is exciting news, announcing the venue is not.", "Wait so your mom prompted you but then \u201cyour parents\u201d thought you were out of line? Your mom did a 180 on a thing she semi-caused?\n\nI\u2019m inclined to NAH but also I see why your sister is mad. You did steal her thunder. Surely in the reverse you would have felt the same.", "YTA:  So she beat you to the punch so to speak.  Decency suggests you allow your sister her moment in the sun.  Your baby news, while incredibly important to you and the family, could have waited another day when the sole focus could have been on you.  Sorry...but you botched this one.", "YTA - You said \n\n>She planned to announce her wedding venue and date at the same dinner without telling anyone.\n\nBut you actually had already told someone! So why did you need to mention it again? You absolutely could have waited! Did your mother admit that she told you to mention your news? Your mother seems like a troublemaker. Does she favor you? You absolutely should have waited because you had already told people! I think you did that to upstage your sister's news and you really should apologize. The fact that you haven't apologized shows that you did it intentionally. If you really cared about your sister, you would call her, tell her you're sorry for upstaging her news and tell her you will be more mindful in the future. You can lie to us, but don't lie to yourself - you knew what you were doing.", "ESH but mainly your sister. A venue/date reveal is NOT A THING. WTF. Your mom is an AH for endorsing you in that moment to share. You\u2019re a little bit of an AH for not reading the room and giving the conversation a min to die down; that comes across like you WERE trying to make it about you. Announcing it 5 min later would have made you not the AH.\n\nCongrats on your news!", "NTA What is wrong with people having to be the centre of attention all the time. \nPlus I want to say adopting is the most wonderful thing anyone can do. I was adopted and am so grateful to have been given a family. Congratulations to you and your child.", "NTA, just leave all the trash and negativity of your so called sister and celebrate the most important moment of your life, because you did not do anything wrong... Confirming the venue is never a thing to celebrate or to steal the spotlight and the fact that she didn't even congratulate you or felt happy but straight up call names shows that you should not care about her", "Everybody, I have an announcement. After all our effort, and a seemingly endless wait, Mr Bialetti and I would like to share the news that\u2026\n\nMY COFFEE IS READY! AAAAAAAHHHH!! Please share in our joy.

Really exciting, I am so happy for you, congratulations!\n\nNTA", "Is this a spec script for a Modern Family, The Next Generation reboot?", "Soft YTA - you should have gone with your instinct and not said it right after. Your mom was wrong.", "YTA. You *knew* this was going to completely steal the moment. Your sister had some good and loving news to share and you just pulled the rug straight out from under her. Couldn't have let her have a single moment to shine? You gave her all of what, thirty seconds to have some attention about it?\n\nYour mum is an asshole too.", "NAH. In don\u2019t get why people are so hung up on having their \u201cmoment\u201d. Too much Hallmark TV. \n\nIt\u2019s possible for people to be excited about two things at the same event. Frankly, I\u2019ve never met anyone who did a venue/date announcement for a wedding though. Your news was much bigger, so the reaction was bigger. Your family were already kind enough to make a fuss about the venue and date as was clearly expected of them. \n\nThere may be reasons we don\u2019t know about which make Emma more sensitive to having her spotlight \u201cstolen\u201d. I\u2019d probably just explain as you have here and apologize for making her feel sad, even though you did nothing wrong. I wouldn\u2019t stand for being called an AH again though, so if her attitude doesn\u2019t lighten up, I\u2019d let her wear herself out with jealousy while you focus on your child. \n\nAs for other family, just explain once and then move on from the drama. Fanning flames just makes the fire bigger.", "Yes", "NAH, gz on the adoption! \n\nAnd stealing thunder? Really? Your family cant be happy for more than one person at the same time? Yikes.", "ehhhh soft YTA. She shared her news already, let her have it, you\u2019re also now sharing a day of news unnecessarily.", "Soft YTA. \nI mean, your mom was more the AH here for telling you that was a good time to announce it while everyone was riled about about your sisters news. It wasn't the right time.", "Soft YTA. Read the room and have tact.", "YTA\n\nYou are just as attention seeking as you say your sister is. \n\nYou could could have waited.\n\nShe loved upstanding her.", "ESH", "You got caught up in the moment.

Presumably, she had a big moment when she announced the engagement, as she should have had.  But I find it very odd that not only does she think the details of her wedding should merit such attention, but that they should not share any attention with anything else.
