Now I'll be the first to admit that when she started to get like this I wasn't the first to help her, I didn't know how, but this time was different. My mom was trying to get my sister up and ready for the day, but after a bit of back and forth my sister just kind of burst into tears. My mom was kind of talking at my sister during this, cutting off her sentence, repeatedly telling her to clean her room, etc. Then I could make out one thing that my sister said \"I don't wanna live here anymore.\" And left the room sobbing.\n\nAt that point I ran out of my room and went to confront my mom, who was trying to follow my sister out of her room. I got into her face about what she had done to my sister, but she was only talking about how she can't be depressed and if she does run away it would be blamed on her and she would go to jail, and if I wanted to help her that I should clean her room myself. I exploded, yelling at her that she needs to be there for her own child if she's depressed and that getting her room clean and taking her to school we're the least of my worries and that I was worried about my sister. I then asked, \"Do you take joy in seeing her like this?\" And her, in a mocking sort of tone, said, \"Yes, yes I do take joy in your sister crying.\"\n\nWe argued for a bit more and I called her a bad mom when my sister stepped back in between us, still sobbing and said that it was her own fault that her room was dirty, she didn't want us arguing, and that I didn't need to worry about her and that I should just get ready for school.

You were absolutely correct to speak up for her, something my brother never did for me as a kid. I always wished he would. \n\nThe problem is, when she\u2019s in her abusive mode, she\u2019s likely experiencing rage and shame. Rage as an uncontrollable reaction to something, and shame because she knows she\u2019s hurting you kids. If you send her an email when you both are calm, try asking her what you should do.\n\nExplain to her what you witnessed, and explain to her how your sister is suffering from being/feeling scapegoated & targeted. Tell her you love her and you understand/you\u2019ve noticed life is very stressful for her lately. Say you don\u2019t want to blame her, but your only goal is to have a safe home for you and your sister. Ask if she will work with you so you can all stay together. Ask how you can help her. Offer to teach your sister to clean or whatever. \n\nThe goal is to make the shame be stronger than her reflexive rage. Also, a lot of moms feel \u201cvictimized\u201d by their daughters\u2019 existence. They take things out on the girls as part of insane delusions that they are competition or intentionally ruining their mothers\u2019 lives. It\u2019s not rational. It\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s a thing that happens. So you have to kind of give her a safe space to realize your sister is not her problem. \n\nAbusive people are exhausting. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to mature so quickly. Your goal is a safe childhood. Ask how all of you can make behavior changes for peace. Including her.", "NTA Keep standing up for your sister.

This isn\u2019t a situation you should have to deal with. This isn\u2019t a situation either of you should be in.\n\nPlease go get help. Go to an adult you trust, maybe a teacher if that\u2019s an option, and tell them you need help. Tell them about what is going on with your sister and tell them about what is going on with your mom. I do feel I have to tell you this though, just so there aren\u2019t any surprises, in the US (don\u2019t know for sure if that\u2019s where you are but I took a guess) many teachers are required by law to report things like this. I\u2019m not telling you this so you don\u2019t confide in an adult. Honestly, I really think you need to. But I just don\u2019t want you to feel betrayed if you didn\u2019t know that was going to happen.\n\nAgain, I am really sorry that this is happening to the both of you. But please, get some help. You and your sister are living with, from all I can tell, an abusive person and are suffering psychologically because of it. It\u2019s not fair at all that it\u2019s happening, but I want you to know that it\u2019s not your fault. Nothing that happens here is your fault. This is squarely on the adult who seems to be repeatedly coming up short. It\u2019s not your fault. None of it is your fault. \n\nNTA.", "Seeing as they just moved back in with the mom, there might be a case worker.", "That's what I was thinking.   OP should contact their case worker immediately."]}
