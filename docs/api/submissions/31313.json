The said representative would be responsible for talking to teachers about problems, handing out and collecting forms at the school level (like for field trips, etc.), and other related stuff.\n\n> I nominated myself for the job, as I've been a class representative for many years before that. \n\n> Well, guess what happened when the teacher-in-charge turned out to be a racist POS. She flat out rejects my nomination. I would not have minded. There were several contenders who would have been good representatives. But my teacher made a comment:\n\n> > *We don't make representatives out of your community, because you're all just thugs and street kids who would never be able to do well in life anyway.*\n\n> The class went silent. Like, absolutely no one was prepared for that level of outright racism.\n\n> Everyone pointed out that I have a record of excellence at the school and she still said that I was not good enough because I'm from said community.\n\nThings like this matter a lot.

They're taking the momentary opportunity to shift the power dynamic from people that boss them around all day. Your daughter shouldn't need to be suspended or apologize but maybe she needs to be talked to about causing issues like this, be made to understand that this isn't bullying, and to be taught what's worth speaking up and fighting for and what isn't.
