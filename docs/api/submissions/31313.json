She's never in trouble; Straight A's, volunteers, wins the kindness award every year and is on track for valedictorian.  Honestly amazing kid. I was shocked.  I end up in the office with the principal, her, the school counselor and a teacher who was very upset.  They wanted a public apology and they were suspending her.  So I say \"what happened?\"  The teacher started crying.  \n\nMy stepdaughter was very angry.  \"My teacher is a hypocrite and made Suszette cry.\"  \n\nMe - \"Principal did she make Suszette cry?\"\n\nPrincipal - \"That is not why we are here.\"\n\nMe - \"If the teacher did something wrong to a student and my kid responded, then your teacher is responsible not my kid.\" \n\nPrincipal - \"We are handling that separately.\"\n\nMe - \"No, we are not.  If your teacher bullied a child and my child defended that child then my child is not in trouble.  Your teacher is.\"\n\nPrincipal - \"The teacher made a mistake and we are handling it.\"\n\nMe - \"No, my kid reacting to a teacher bullying a child is not a punishable.  I want to see where in the code of conduct you have stated she cannot defend a student against a bully teacher.\"\n\nPrincipal - \"Okay, it is not in there.\"\n\nMe - \"Then you cannot suspend her and if my lawyer needs to say that, I can call him now.\"\n\nPrincipal - \"You are right, no suspension.  I insist on the apologize.\" \n\nMe - \"No, but you should get the school lawyer in here, my lawyer will want to talk to him.\"\n\nTeacher - \"You don't understand she was horrible and I made a mistake.\"\n\nMe - \"A child should not be held to a higher standard then an authority figure.\"\n\nCounselor - \"You are right but as a student she is held to a standard and it is best if she apologizes.\"\n\nMe - \"Okay, after the teacher publicly apologizes to Suszette, my daughter will apologize to her.\"\n\nPrincipal - \"Teacher matters are handled privately.\"\n\nMe - \"I am calling my lawyer. You can explain to him why a white teacher can bully a black child and a different black child has to publicly apologize to a white teacher but a white teacher is held to a lower standard then black child and can only be dealt with privately.\"\n\nPrincipal - \"Fine, no apology and no suspension.  You can go back to class.\"\n\nMe - \"I am going to have my lawyer follow up with the school to make sure the teacher is dealt with correctly.\"\n\nPrincipal - \"Not necessary, we will handle it.\"\n\nMe - \"Very necessary, expect my lawyer's call.\" \n\nI leave, later my wife blows up at me because I have no idea what happened and I made sure if she did something she got away with it.  I feel like I kept the school from making up policies to punish my kid when the teacher bullied a child.  But my wife is mad so was I wrong?  Am I ahole?

Teachers suck. Always have done and always will be. When I was in secondary school or what Americans call high school,  I used to get picked on everyday yet I was the one who got called disruptive. I struggled the whole time at school but I only found out 7 years ago that I was autistic", "nta - you did the right thing by standing up for your stepdaughter. it's important to hold authority figures accountable for their actions especially when they are bullying students. kudos to you for not letting the school unjustly punish your kid.", "Sounds like a bullshit made up story to get upvotes. \n\n*White teacher humiliates black student and another black student gets in trouble for calling them out.*\n\nI\u2019ll take things that never happened for $500 Alex.", "NTA. The next thing you need to do is get your stepdaughter out of that teacher's class, if at all possible. After what has transpired, it's unlikely she'll get fair treatment from the teacher for the rest of the term.", "NTA!! If this happened as you told it, you are a HERO. What a wonderful example for your stepdaughter of how to advocate for someone who is being bullied. I can see where she learned it.", "NTA based on your daughter\u2019s record of responsibility and what you\u2019ve told us here I don\u2019t know why your wife assumed your daughter did something wrong and got away with it. Good job; that\u2019s probably where your daughter learned to advocate for herself and others.", "NTA AT ALL!!!", "NTA\n\nThe whole situation is weird. I hope they understand you\u2019re serious about the lawyer and won\u2019t dare to mess with your daughters academic performance as an act of revenge.\n\nWhat they wanted was to punish your daughter by calling you in. You proved her that you cannot be used as a source of fear and negativity against her. You only offer protection, security and defense. This is more valuable than anything. She will remember this and will not hesitate to go to you with problems in the future. \n\nHope the school will also remember not to bother you because of petty drama, expecting you to get into details. Sometimes school staff spends too much time around children they start acting like kids themselves and forget that people don\u2019t have interest in that. You got all the important info, your daughter stood up to a bully teacher, who recognized the mistake, so your daughter was correct. That\u2019s enough.", "nta. you stood up for your stepdaughter and defended her against unfair treatment at school. it's commendable that you didn't let the school bully her into making a public apology when the teacher was the one at fault. bravo for advocating for your child and demanding accountability from the school.", "INFO: did your daughter tell you what happened? As in, the specific interaction between teacher, suzette and her", "nta. you did the right thing by standing up for your stepdaughter. it's important to hold authority figures accountable for their actions especially when it involves bullying. your daughter should not be punished for defending a fellow student. bravo for advocating for her rights!", "NTA.  The principal would not have backed down if your stepdaughter had not have been right", "Definitely NTA.  Way to back up your child OP!  OP raised a good one.", "NTA - You know and trust your kid. Of course you believe her, she\u2019s never given any reason to doubt her, no patterns of lying or bad behavior. You took her at her word because her word is trustworthy. That\u2019s what a parent should do. You were in your kid\u2019s corner and handled it superbly.\n\nPrincipal confirmed your daughter\u2019s account anyway, with how they tried so hard to dodge with vague answers and shift the blame. A child shouldn\u2019t be punished when they\u2019re defending a peer from an injustice.\n\nYour daughter sounds awesome, and you handled this conversation with a lot of class. Excellent work to both of you!", "At first, I would like to get more info on what exactly the teacher did, but as the principal kept dodging the subject with \"it's not what we're here for\" and \"we're handling it separately and privately\", then they clearly know that the teacher has done something wrong and wanted the matter swept under the rug.  Therefore, NTA!", "NTA\n\nWell done. Adults don't get to behave in shitty ways and then blame the kid who calls them out. It sounds like Suszette's parents need to pursue this bullying. Bullying students is never okay. The fact that it was cross racial makes it all sorts of worse.\n\nI hope you do have your attorney stay on this and maybe talk to the school board about expectations at your daughter's school.\n\nYou did a great job showing your daughter that the school can't use you against her and that you will hear **and believe** her first. Hopefully that will pay off in spades if you ever need it to.", "NTA Bravo to you dad, you handled that perfectly.", "nta. you did the right thing by standing up for your stepdaughter and not letting the school unfairly punish her. it's important to prioritize the well-being of the students and hold authority figures accountable for their actions. kudos to you for advocating for your child's rights.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
