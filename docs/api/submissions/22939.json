I normally don\u2019t have a problem with this but we recently got a new bartender and he just sucks.\n\nHe\u2019s the definition of a personality hire. He\u2019s always the last to show up and the first to leave. He didn\u2019t help with opening duties or closing duties. He shows up 10 minutes late typically. When just him and I, I end up doing the majority of the work.\n\nHe is the definition of a personality hire. When we have orders he spends his time flirting the waitress. He spends 10 minutes making a single drink when I\u2019ll have multiple tickets finished and sent out in the time. As a result, I complete more order than him. It\u2019s frustrating cause everyone likes him and no one notices his little work he does. He cracks a few jokes, makes a drink and then goes to the bathroom for 20 minutes. Does nothing goes on break for half an hour and then to top it off complain about how many drink we\u2019re supposed to make.\n\nIt\u2019s at the point where I\u2019m pissed that I\u2019m doing most of the work and giving him half the money. So yesterday I decided that I would keep track of all our order tickets. We typically use the same spindle for completed tickets but I saved mine to the side. By the time our shift was over, I about 3 times the tickets as him.\n\nWhile he was in the bathroom during when we should be closing, I brought our tickets to my manager and showed him. I told him that I did the majority of the orders, opened, and closed. It wasn\u2019t right for me to give him half when he fucked around for most of the shift.\n\nHe agreed and said I could split the money to better represent our work. I did 75/25 even though I feel like 80/20 was fair. He of course was pissed as he ended up taking home about 90 dollars while I took 270 and we had a huge argument where he accused me of stealing. I told him to either contribute more or take it up with the manager.\n\nHe\u2019s mad at me, his waitress buddies took his side over mine and they all think im wrong. \n\nSo here\u2019s why I think I could be the asshole:\n\nI was technically being selfish. I wanted more money for the work I do. I also don\u2019t technically *need* the money. I\u2019m 21 just saving money so I don\u2019t have to get a job when school starts back up in August. I don\u2019t have rent it bills. The only thing I regularly need to spend money on is gas. He\u2019s in his mid 20s and has like a kid. He also works a second job so I guess he has a reason to be tired and that sucks but I don\u2019t think that justifies him to use my work for his benefit.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690110089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157bxko/aita_for_taking_75_of_the_money_we_were_supposed/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
