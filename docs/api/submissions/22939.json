Some nights you\u2019ll have it better than your coworker but taking 75% is ridiculous. \n\nI bet OP isn\u2019t responsible for that much of the tips. That\u2019s the problem. Op is a kid.

That's not what OP is describing. \n\nAnd how much of your shift do you spend in the bathroom?  If he has a medical issue, all that would have to be said by management is \"X has a medical issue, and we are aware of it.\"  No details need be given, but if that's the reason he's regularly spending 20 min in the bathroom, then your co-workers should be given a head's up.", "In time he'll date a few of them and do a poor job at being a boyfriend or worse two time most of them and the problem will take care of itself with the servers.\n\nSince he's already spending most of his time flirting with them it's inevitable that he'll do these things.", "Bank what you can while you can.

Even though you are in the right, people don\u2019t like complaining.  It doesn\u2019t matter why, most people don\u2019t like negativity or conflict and they avoid it. Being strategic and professional in voicing your concerns is important.  Don\u2019t appear angry or vindictive.  Always show data \u2014 like you\u2019ve done. Always include your manager. The other bartender also knows what he\u2019s doing and he\u2019s done this his whole like I suspect.

Let it be known that if works more he\u2019ll get more.  It\u2019s that simple. Maybe talk to the manager and make sure that the opening and closing duties are split evenly.  Thats my approach.

Yeah maybe I can feel like I did more work but I just did different work. \n\nTalking to people and being likeable is a good skill to have in tipping industries. It\u2019s far more important than being able to make a ton of drinks orders. Anyone can do that. This is also why bartenders have bar backs who typically get tipped out less. They do a lot of the grunt work and help make drinks when bartenders are dealing the customer aspect. \n\nShould barbacks get 75% and bartenders keep 25%?
