She should have stayed home with her crotch dropping if she didn't want to be in an area where smoking was permitted.", "NTA. She shouldn't bring her baby into a designated smoking area. Who does that????", "You were in a designated area for smoking. She brought her child to a bar and then the smoking area. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA I would\u2019ve literally said why on earth, would you be in a smoking section with a baby. And it is insane to expect the people that chose this intentionally to smoke\u2026 To not smoke just because of you.", "NTA. I would have lit a couple more cigarettes and smoked them all at once. \nI also understand being uncomfortable smoking around a child. But it's not your fault she brought her baby into the smoking section. I'm sure she'd move eventually. Literally smoke her out.", "Not ur descision to make for others", "dude it\u2019s a designated smoking section for a reason, anyone \u201cintelligent enough\u201d should be able to read signs and avoid the area.", "I would have blown smoke directly at her and the baby, and told her to get bent. NTA, but I definitely would be.", "You should go for a smoke anyway, stand right by the smoking area sign", "That's her problem then.  She had no right to try to make it your problem.  I have 2 kids.  I never would have taken them to the smoking section.", "it\u2019s called a pack of yowins where I come from", "Get a friend to light it for you. Go outside and stand there masked, holding a cigarette.", "NTA This is like her bringing her kids to a nudist beach and demanding people cover up because it would affect her kids. (minds instead of their bodies though)", "You're an AH for still smoking. But in this case you are correct and NTA", "NTA. It's like going into a strip club and asking the dancers to put clothes on because nudity makes you uncomfortable.", "Nta", "NTA- you were literally in the smoking area. Go back out there and light up, right in the middle of their party.", "NTA \u2026 I don\u2019t smoke but if I were near this establishment I would go there and have a cigarette. Forget that lady and her offspring. The world doesn\u2019t stop just because you popped one it. It\u2019s not a miracle it\u2019s the circle of life , now hurry up and die already because she\u2019s clearly dead on the inside already.", "Who brings a baby to a bar?", "NTA! Id have had to light up another.  Im a smoker and respectful about it, ie kids etc but she was out of line", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t have moved.", "Why is she at a bar with a baby?????", "Go out and light up. Screw em. I hate smoking but screw em for taking over a space. NTA", "I'll go with you. I'll probably cough, it's been about 15 years but it'll be worth it", "I guess OP is required to put out their cig, kidnap the children from the negligent parents, deposit them at some sort of safe haven, and then go back to finish their cig. Since the well-being of those children are now OP'S responsibility.", "The smokers are the moneymaker, *and* so often (not *always,* but *YES, often!*) those sorts of jerkishly-entitled \"family folks\" will run the poor servers ragged, camp out *forevvvver,* and tie up *incredibly* valuable tables which could've turned at *least* 3-4\u00d7 in the time they've camped out (letting their little ones make a *giant* mess, which they leave because \"that's the server's *job!*)\n\nSaw it *far* too many times over the years, when I sold pulltabs (a type of charitable gambling--for those who don't have pulltabs in their bars.)"]}
