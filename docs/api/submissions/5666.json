She had every option of not going into the smoking section, but chose to anyway.", "NTA. As a mother myself I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere near the smoking section. She has a lot of nerve demanding that you leave the space designated for smoking when she could go literally anywhere else. \n\nOut of curiosity, how well signposted is the smoking area? If it\u2019s subtly signposted and maybe she wasn\u2019t aware, the venue should do something about that. Either way she\u2019s still TA for the entitlement of demanding you move when you were there first, minding your own business and well within your rights to smoke", "NTA - she is.  I loath cigarette smoke, especially in a restaurant or something, and even I wouldn't be upset with you for smoking in the smoking area.  \\*I might be upset with the restaurant if they pull one of those stunts where the smoking and non-smoking areas are two tables, next to each other and separated by nothing, but even then you're where you should be, doing what you're allowed to do there.", "NTA. She took over the smoking section and demanded people not smoke in it. She is definitely TA", "NTA. If she doesnt want her child around smoke she shouldnt go and plonk herself in the smoking area!", "NTA    as smokers we end up in a tiny area where we can smoke, she was out of line.", "NTA. How is she even allowed in there with a baby? Here in Australia kids and eating aren't allowed in designated smoking areas in public venues.", "NTA. I would've stopped her before she got too close to warn her it was the smoking section lol. She shouldn't be allowed to take a child into that section.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If OP is in Australia (as just one example), most pubs have childrens menus and so on - its accepted that kids will be around, but they may have zones that kids aren't allowe in (a front bar/pokies area), and licencing may restrict kids from being on the premises after a certain time, usually 10pm or midnight. It's entirely possible that the smoking area doesn't permit U18s, and the group of parents was doing the wrong thing. \n\nEdit: OP, NTA.
