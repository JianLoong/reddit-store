That\u2019s what fast food is for", "In places where there are long stretches of nothing, you need to plan when and where to stop, where to gas etc if they're going somewhere unfamiliar, sometimes it's nice to see if there are famous food places to stop by too", "it depends on the people really. \n\nsome of my people really like eating out so they will definitely insist on planning the meal brakes and adjusting the route to fit their 'favorites'. whereas people like me would rather pack a lunch and plan to get to somewhere pretty and sit there on a blanket.", "They actually did speak up when they got hungry", "a boundary is a rule you set for how you allow other people to treat you. she told her friends \u201ci will not plan this trip\u201d and they pushed against that boundary by trying to get her to plan where to eat.", "But are they vegans or people with food problems? They mentioned going to a diner. Presumably they either aren\u2019t vegans or don\u2019t mind toast and salad for dinner", "But they still expected OP to find food while they were driving because they were too useless to look something up on the phone that was probably in their hands already.", "Yeah but to an extent OP just needed to do a quick search of something nearby. Yet so did everyone else in the car. Thus ESH", "4 meals In 20hrs? Who are you, andre the giant? That's two meals max and a bag of chips.", "Yeah, but some places the only option is a form of potatoes, which isn't very filling on a 20-hour road trip. Why not take the time to find some hidden gems for vegan food if you're doing all that driving anyways, honestly.", "Because they thought OP already had a plan for where they were gonna eat.", "I think OPs problem is that the kids she was nannying can't bother to search.", ">Yeah but to an extent OP just needed to do a quick search of something nearby.\n\nSounds like the OP was driving though.", "Oh man... I've been processing comments wrongly for weeks then!\n\nI thought ESH was like \"eeeeeshh\", like no is an asshole but you could all do better.", "They had been told op wasn't going to plan meals, and had been told at the previous meal(s) that op had not and would not plan meals for them.", "Lmaoo right!", "At one point but not the whole way. And look this argument could go in circles. So let\u2019s just end it with anyone is capable of googling. Whether it\u2019s their \u201cresponsibility\u201d or not", "And considering their surprise and anger, its pretty clear OP either didn\u2019t communicate the message to them as clearly as they thought, or maybe they just forgot. Honestly I\u2019m leaning on the former because I doubt both of them simply just forgot. \n\nThe mature thing to do in this situation is remind them of it regardless and you\u2019d be justified at being annoyed about the whole situation. You should not passive aggressively drive for hours until they realize the problem. What does that accomplish exactly. Is getting one over your \u201cfriends\u201d so important to you? Should you really go straight to assuming the worst that your friends are just using you and ignoring you?\n\nIts precisely this kind of childish immature that I hate so much because it does absolutely nothing other than to satisfy yourself. Assuming the worse out of your friends and acting passive aggressively when the entire situation could be solved if they had at any point during the drive to dinner reminded them that they hadn\u2019t planned for anything. But no, they just had to play stupid games."]}
