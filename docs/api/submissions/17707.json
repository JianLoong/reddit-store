You can't starve on potatoes. Will you be the healthiest you could be eating nothing but potatoes, of course not, but like objectively, historically, provably 'just potatoes' will keep you alive a long time.", "They complain a lot for dead people.\n\nNTA", "Over the years I have developed a set of rules for a successful road trip: 1. Be flexible: things might not go exactly as planned. 2. Be patient; it will always take longer than you thought. 3. Don't be cheap; pay for your own share happily and offer to pay for more if you can. 4. No whining.\n\nI believe OP's travel companions did not follow the rules.  They clearly broke Nos. 1 and 4. Also possibly No. 2. (No mention of money so 3 not in play).\n\nNTA.", "OP is driving and shouldn\u2019t be looking at their phone. The lazy folks in the back could contribute by researching places to eat. The is no justification for their whining. NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm also a \"planner\" for family but occasionally i'll let folks know... \n\n\"she's your friggin mother too... figure out something\" LOL\n\nand either something gets figured out or not - not my monkey, not my circus", "NTA", "Three adults and not one person could decide where to eat for dinner?? How are you all grown?? ESH", "They really that lazy? It\u2019s a road trip good grief. 3 people and 3 meals a day. So each person should pick one. Mid morning midafternoon late night. That way it straddles meals people may or may not like. All of yours are kinda THA, but them more then you.", "So Stanley is going to see his family, on a trip he has presumably made before, and has no idea about what options for food there are and he can\u2019t be bothered to look up the restaurants on the phone while you are driving (and shouldn\u2019t look up restaurants)? \n\nNTA. It\u2019s f***ing exhausting to always be the person who plans everything. And your friends sound ridiculous by being unwilling to use technology to say \u201cThere is an Applebees and a Chilis at the next exit. Let\u2019s pick one of those.\u201d like any adult on a road trip. \n\nI used to have a lot of friends who could not make decisions about lunch, so I ended up doing it for them. I hated it and when someone inevitably didn\u2019t like their food then I felt bad. So I implemented this process: \n1 Person with phone or lots of knowledge of the area identifies the options\n2 everyone lists one option they like and vetos anything they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to eat.\n3 Driver or other decision maker decides.\n4 everyone goes and eats and no one complains. If they didn\u2019t like their food then the next time they say \u201cI didn\u2019t really love Taco Macho. Let\u2019s not go there again.\u201d\n\nGood luck with the rest of the trip OP!", "This is the best reply!", "I buy snacks from the first 7/11 i find like a hyperactive 5 year old who has been given their mothers wallet. \nSame thing as dinner, right?", "US gas prices are significantly cheaper than European gas prices.\n\nPer this web site, UK gas prices are 1.8 times US gas prices. https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/gasoline_prices", "So\u2026 why didn\u2019t the pack snacks? A cooler?", "When Stanley said he was hungry, OP said, \u201ccool, pick a place,\u201d and Stanley refused!!! \n\nI\u2019m sorry but if this is how they are I can absolutely understand OP not wanting to play nursemaid any longer.", "okay haha i don\u2019t really know what to do with this info.", "what?! wow", "Seriously ? NTA. \n\nOP was invited and CLARIFIED that she will not be planning the trip and for them to take the lead. \n\nSounds like your friends just wanted you to tag along because you\u2019re good at planning and they clearly suck at it. A lot of taking and not so much giving. \n\nSucks to be everyone", "NTA Rent a car and get out of dodge. The rest of this road trip is going to go down hill from here.", "NTA they are not helpless children, and you told them ahead of time you wouldn't be planning it.\n\nSince you were going to see Stanley's family, I assume he's been on that route before?  Why didn't he plan it?", "ESH. Were you driving through a part of the country where McDonald's is illegal? Just stop and eat!", "ESH. The three of you acted like children.", "LMAO what? No you just find a cool place wherever you're near to pull off to, your friends are being goobers, this is just dumb.", "Nope. You stated you were not accepting that responsibility and they didn't believe you. Rent a car go home in peace.", "When did 13yr olds start taking road trips?", "I always pack food, water drinks fruit, everything.", "Burger king is now a pretty good vegan option if you are okay with impossible burgers. Just remove the mayo and it's vegan!", "The OP doesn't say anything about food restrictions.", "or you could.. you know bring food along."]}
