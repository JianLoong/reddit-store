They seemed shocked, but didn't say anything and we ended up stopping at a random rest stop by chance so it worked out. \n\nDuring lunch though, they asked where we were going for dinner. Once again, I said I had no idea. Jessica laughed and said, \"No really, where are we eating?\" \n\nI once again reaffirmed that I had no idea. \n\nWe started driving, and I feel like they purposefully planned my leg during dinner time. But I decided to be stubborn and I just kept driving and driving until Stanley complained about being hungry. I said cool, he could look up somewhere to eat, and that's when we all started arguing. \n\nThey said that it wasn't fair for me to \"spring\" the responsibility of planning meals on them when the trip started. I told them that I was pretty straightforward before we even left, and that they were sitting in the car for 5 hours doing nothing so why couldn't they look stuff up on their phone? \n\nNow they say that I was being an AH for not saying anything and just driving through dinnertime, causing them to \"starve to death\" so I could prove a point. I told them that we still ended up getting fast food, so they were being a bit dramatic. \n\nThe fights pretty bad though, to the point where I'm about to rent a separate car to drive home, so I wanted to check if I was an AH before I make it worse.", "created_utc": 1684548499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13meyfm/aita_for_purposefully_not_planning_a_meal_during/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They could have looke dup places in the area like you suggested and also they could literally just look around and say something like \"oh there's restaurants up the road lwts go check it out\".
