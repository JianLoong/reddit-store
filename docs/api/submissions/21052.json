He doesn't get to call out grandpa for being an environmental destroyer oil dude, then ask to benefit from the oil money.

To me these are two different cases with perhaps two different verdicts. Presumably your niece could use that money for rehab and a place to live.

Setting a 5 year deadline seems somewhat arbitrary when she doesn't have the tools yet to get help. \n\nYour son is a bit of a hypocrite but again, forcing him to retract his statement seems flawed considering he could just lie and frankly, it doesn't really matter to your Father now anyway, so this is for you and you only. \n\nETA: hit save before I finished.

Giving her access to all the money in the inheritance could kill her just as quickly (if not quicker) because all that money in the hands of a junkie will be blown through to feed the addiction. The wisest move here is to use her portion of the estate to get her into a really good rehab program followed by ongoing outpatient support (perhaps a live in sober coach) and keep it set up as a trust to pay her living expenses until she's been clean for a set # of years. She can ask the trust for access money for additional big ticket things like education, purchasing a house, etc where the trustee can ensure the money is being spent for those things. This sort of set up protects Emma from herself and helps ensure she doesn't blow through all her money so the funds are available to help her live a healthier life", "He\u2019s def AH but The only one who is entitled is the brother. Technically grandchildren aren\u2019t entitled to anything unless specifically laid out in the will.

He's doing that exactly that, even if the deceased was an AH for their stance on religious beliefs.", "He might not even be a hypocrite, he might want to use his share to clean up the environment or put solar panels on his roof or something. The money is already made, the damage is done, doesn't mean it can't now be put to good use.", "Imo, that's precisely what makes OP TA. Especially if it really did ultimately fall on \"his discretion.\" We can all see that OP certainly inherited bigotry, judgement and punishing adults for words they said as teenagers from daddy. I could get behind OP enforcing *how* money is spent for Emma. I've been a drug addict, so I'm well aware that the only time sobriety will stick is when the addict actually, sincerely WANTS to stop. But there are so many ways he could make sure that she doesn't spend money on drugs. He could make direct payments for a home or apartment and utilities, he could give her a monthly \"allowance\" to pay for her necessities with a stipulation that she has to show proof of how every cent was spent in order to receive money the following month, he could pay for rehab if she wants help or buy her a vehicle with it so she isn't forced to sleep on the street or in shelters. That's fine, sure. But to enforce a religious conversion? Horrific. If my parent felt that way, I'd happily let that die with them. And holding a young man accountable for things he said as an angsty teenager? Yikes. I'm curious as to what the plan for the money is if brother doesn't change his religious beliefs, neice dies from an overdose or never reaches 5 full years of sobriety, or son never \"takes back\" things he said before his brain finished developing.", "Exactly. I was hoping OP would answer me, but oh well.", "I still think we need OP to clarify - where did these stipulations come from?", "Right - im a firm believer that you don\u2019t legislate from the grave so his father is an AH for the religious conversion and teenager one. \n\nBut if this is just what OP thought his dad would want hes an AH for propagating this bs", "If it\u2019s up to his discretion, as he says, then not really.", "What do you mean? Im fairly certain we can figure this out! \n\n/s", "It depends on the law of the country. In mine, if my parent dies before my grandparents, I'm entitled to their share of the inheritance upon my grandparents' death.", "I understand what you're saying. But OP is also an AH for continuing to enforce his father's AH believes.\n\nThis also really depends on the law. This wouldn't be possible in my country. It's not possible to disown a son. Even though there is a part of the inheritance you can leave to whomever you want, the rest is to be divided equally amongst the descendants regardless of their believes/choices, so even Josh would get his fair share.", "The issue is that it says \"according to his wishes *and* my discretion\", and we don't know for 100% sure which is which based off what OP's said. If it's not explicitly written into the will and OP is doing it at his discretion, it's definitely a shitty move.", "Yeah if that is the case then upholding discriminatory, stupid old man rules like that is honestly just gross and gives me a very negative opinion of OP", "An executor does not typically have this kind of discretion. This guy is setting the estate up for lawsuits I think.\n\nDo we really believe the grandfather wrote \u201cand my grandson doesn\u2019t get this inheritance until he renounces the insults he hurled at me as a teen\u201d in a will? \n\nThat he wrote \u201cand my granddaughter shall be clean for half the time was was using before inheritance shall be dispersed\u201d?\n\nI\u2019m not buying it.

What country, if I may ask? I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing personally, so am quite curious!", "Yes people write wills like that.", "And with Josh - is he supposed to appear in town square to refute his previous claims? How is that one in anyway enforceable?", "This is the case in the US where there\u2019s no will. If no spouse, children split estate equally. If a child predeceases the parent then any offspring of dead child would split their share between them.", "I\u2019m in the US, this I know. But that doesn\u2019t over ride a will, which this poster says happens in their country - I\u2019m no world travelled legal Eagle, but that is just interesting as heck to me that a law would be written that way! I\u2019m over here tryna Google it just cause it blows my little mind, haha!", "Portugal.\n\nThere's a percentage of the inheritance that can be left in the will for whoever the deceased wants (it can also be to one of the children). I think it's like 20% or something like that, not sure the amount.\n\nBut children (or grandchildren if the children have already departed), spouses or parents (if there are no children) can never be taken out of the will and the percentage they get is stipulated (apart from those 20% that can be left to whomever). \n\nIf there is a spouse and kids, then it's divided equally except if there are more than 3 children as the spouse is always entitled to at least a quarter. The rest is equally divided amongst the children. If one of the children is already deceased their children get that part.\n\nIf there's only children, the children divide it equally.\n\nIf there's a spouse and parents (but no children), then the parents receive a part (I think it's 30% not sure the amount). The rest goes for the spouse.\n\nIf there are only parents they get everything. \n\nThese four points are regardless of any will (apart from the percentage I mentioned at the beginning).\n\nIf there are no parents, no spouse and no children, then the will determines who gets what. If there's no will then it's for the siblings, if no siblings then it goes to the next of kin until a maximum of 4 degrees. If there are no relatives until 4 degrees then it goes to the state.", "It's not the same but in the UK a surviving spouse is entitled even if the will stipulates otherwise. A woman was recently awarded half her husband's estate after he left everything to his two sons and nothing to his daughters and wife.", "Thank you!\n\nThe US has, well, a similar sort of default structure - but in the absence of a will. For us in the US, a will takes precedence over the structure. Heck, you can leave everything in a trust to fund the support of your cat if you so wish. Sounds like yours is the other way around, structure has precedence over a will. Learn something new every day!", "The idea is that there are some people who must be protected. It's to prevent parents leaving everything to one of the children just because they don't like the other (like the religious example in OP's post).\n\nHere you can leave the free percentage to a charity or something like that. But it's not legal to leave any money for an animal."]}
