My sister, Emma's mom, argues that she should get her inheritance now to get help. I argued that Emma will get her share, **after** she's been clean for at least \\~5y (half the time she's been a junkie), because I'm not risking the money going to more drugs. \n\nAnd lastly my son, Josh...

Such a shame he didn't leave a legally binding will with each person's share clearly laid out.  If I were you, I would do this:\n\n\\- Your son.  This is the easiest.  He doesn't get to call out grandpa for being an environmental destroyer oil dude, then ask to benefit from the oil money. Give his share  of the money to an environmental charity if he won't retract his statements.\n\n\\- Niece - Giving a junkie a ton of money will kill her.

Above was written on the assumption that your father left his wishes, but that they were not legally binding, ie that you as executor had the final say.\n\nIn this case, NTA.  It's pretty awful to disinherit someone over their religion, but that's call has been made by your father.  The other two are more complex.

Personally, I'd perhaps have gone against the wishes of my Dad on that one, but maybe that makes me an asshole. \n\nWhere this is getting tricky is with your niece and son, where it seems like you are creating stipulations and not your Father. To me these are two different cases with perhaps two different verdicts. Presumably your niece could use that money for rehab and a place to live. It's a lot easier to get clean when you have support. Setting a 5 year deadline seems somewhat arbitrary when she doesn't have the tools yet to get help. \n\nYour son is a bit of a hypocrite but again, forcing him to retract his statement seems flawed considering he could just lie and frankly, it doesn't really matter to your Father now anyway, so this is for you and you only. \n\nETA: hit save before I finished.

She can ask the trust for access money for additional big ticket things like education, purchasing a house, etc where the trustee can ensure the money is being spent for those things.

I could get behind OP enforcing *how* money is spent for Emma. I've been a drug addict, so I'm well aware that the only time sobriety will stick is when the addict actually, sincerely WANTS to stop. But there are so many ways he could make sure that she doesn't spend money on drugs. He could make direct payments for a home or apartment and utilities, he could give her a monthly \"allowance\" to pay for her necessities with a stipulation that she has to show proof of how every cent was spent in order to receive money the following month, he could pay for rehab if she wants help or buy her a vehicle with it so she isn't forced to sleep on the street or in shelters. That's fine, sure. But to enforce a religious conversion? Horrific. If my parent felt that way, I'd happily let that die with them. And holding a young man accountable for things he said as an angsty teenager? Yikes.

For us in the US, a will takes precedence over the structure. Heck, you can leave everything in a trust to fund the support of your cat if you so wish. Sounds like yours is the other way around, structure has precedence over a will. Learn something new every day!", "The idea is that there are some people who must be protected.

Yipes.\n\nA legitimate health concern accompanies the prospect of giving a junkie a massive amount of money, so I get thinking a trust would be a good option for your niece. \n\nAnd as for your son...was he saying anything that was untrue? Maybe if he got his inheritance, he could right some of the wrongs done. I get that your dad didn't like being insulted, but sometimes someone has to point out when a correction is in order. He sounds as if he has a wider perspective on the situation. Is it worth it to you to lose connection with him? Just so you can prove a point? Really? I don't know.

Your sister is ludicrously naive to think the money will go into getting better when your father previously funded two rehab tours.\n\nAs for your son, well...he's a hypocrite. He blathered a whole bunch of shit and now he's demanding his share of the *blood money?* Like, I get it he was younger, but it doesn't sound like he's particularly apologetic about it.
