Afterwards dad married his mistress and mom stayed single but made her way up and was able to provide me and my siblings a good life. As of late i\u2019ve been working as a waitress. I want to buy a car but doing chores aren\u2019t enough and my mom wouldn\u2019t give me any extra chores so i took the job. So i started saving my checks and tips. Every other weekend my dad and his family has been coming over. Lately tho i\u2019ve started noticing that my money has been going missing. It started with 1 or 5 dollars missing but it\u2019s gotten aggressively more. Like 20-30 dollars are missing. My savings has gone from around 500 to roughly 300. I brought this up to my family but they expressed on multiple occasions they haven\u2019t taken it. I tried putting it in different places but it still goes missing. \n\nI caught my dads kids hanging around my room and sitting outside of it. I asked them to stay away from my room but they get offended and tell their mom that i don\u2019t wanna hang out with them; always ends in an argument. 3-4 weeks ago when i got home from work they were in my room and taking money from my savings i yelled at them to put the money back and to get out of my room. My dad and their mom heard me yelling and came up to see what was I yelling about. They were on my side and grounded them. Apparently their kids have been taking my money and they explained that they have been coming home with money but they had no idea where they got it from and gave me a 50 as an apology. \n\nNow whenever i go out i started locking my door. I mean every day even when their not there i look my door. They started taking offense to this. They keep telling me there\u2019s no need for me to lock my door and that they make sure that their kids aren\u2019t around my room anymore but like i lost so much money from this. They didn\u2019t work those 8 hours shift i did and they got the money from it.

Keep your door locked girl", "NTA, you never even got compensated fairly. If the kids won\u2019t steal anymore there is also no reason as to why they should be in your room anyway, it\u2019s your room and you deserve privacy. Stand your ground on this one, they have no reason to enter your room", "Absolutely NTA.  Also- can you get a savings account to put that cash into? What exactly did your family do when you caught the kids stealing?", "NTA .\n\nI did the same thing after I caught one of my siblings stealing money from my room. To make matters worse my sister only stole coins I had saved for years (by this I mean collectible coins, collected through average transactions) and spent them all on things my mom also willingly gave her money for.\n\nWhen I put a lock on my door the bullying persisted for weeks. It was only because they couldn't steal from me anymore. They never intended to stop. My mom even told me last year she was angry because if my sister could take money from me, then she asks my mom for less. So. Don't let them bully you or make you feel bad. If it makes them feel bad about themselves they need to do some self reflecting and maybe work on themselves a lot.\n\nEdit to fix some spelling as I was half asleep this morning when I responded sorry.", "NTA.\n \nThey\u2019re lucky all you\u2019re doing is locking a door. \u2014 I\u2019d call the cops if it continues \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. And how exactly do they know you are STILL locking the door after they gave you the guilt $50? Do they see you do it, or is it because someone is still attempting to open the door when you aren\u2019t there?\n\nEither way it doesn\u2019t matter. They need to explain to their kids that actions have consequences and that trust takes time to re establish once broken. These are life basics.", "So your dad brings his new wife and kids to your mom\u2019s house to visit??? Your mom is a saint to allow this. \n\nOf course you\u2019ll lock your door. Those kids have stolen $200 from you, and your dad gave you $50 as recompense. Still owes you $150. \n\nNTA. \n\nTell your dad and his mistress wife they can be as offended as they want to be. Their children\u2019s actions have proven it\u2019s necessary and they still owe you $150.", "NTA. Remind them they still owe you about $200.\n\nGotta admit, I'm confused as to why your Dad & stepmother/mistress are coming over to your Mom's house so often?", "NTA, I too would lock my door. They can be offended all they like, it's the smart thing to do", "NTA - Your room, your lock.  They have already proved to be thieves and guaranteed they aren't the least bit concerned their parents will really ever stop them and they are right.", "NTA\n\nOne of the unfortunate things about having your privacy/space/money violated is that after that first time, you never fully get the feeling of security back. Plus, they've already proven that they can't be trusted to control their children (because who just lets their kids come back with money and not question it??), and won't fully compensate your for any damages (because $50 doesn't sound like everything the lil gremlins stole), and beyond just them and their kids it's not unreasonable to be concerned that something might happen and to just not want people in your space. If it gets to the point of being a compulsion, like you start getting paranoid about it, it would be worth talking to someone about it/working on it. Make sure your mom has a key for emergencies and everything should be fine?\n\nHow old are the younger kids, by the way? Because if they're like <6 you're right they probably don't know better, but any older and they shoudl know better and their parents should have taught them properly lol", "NTA\n\nThey raised thieves and they still owe you $150. They need to pay it and take the time to actually raise children who don't steal. You preventing their thieves from stealing you reminds them daily that they aren't doing a good enough job parenting their children. Keep at it. They still owe you money, and your money clearly isn't safe with an unlocked door.\n\nBut I recommend you look into a bank account. Storing your money in your home is always going to end badly.", "NTA. \n\nA) it is your room, your half siblings have no reasons to be in there, if they are not even living in the same house.\n\nB) Don't know how old they are but it sounds they know what money is and even were looking for it in the first place. So they should know that they were stealing and that this is wrong. So they have to suffer the consequences and that you won't trust them anymore, won't play with them and don't do anything with them is the least consequence\n\nC) If your dad and his new wife think it was 'just a little money' then they should give you the full amount of money back. And then you can consider if you want to play with your half siblings again\n\nD) Your dad and his wife saw that the kids had money no one knew where it came from. And they had no idea to ask you and your mothers side of the family if the gave it to them or are missing something. Sounds like your dad had no problem with your half siblings stealing from you as long as you had no prove\n\nSo no. Don't open your room up to them. And also consider if this is a reason that your half siblings should be banned from your house for a few months (talk to your mother). Because if they steal from you, who knows if they aren't stealing from the rest of the family as well", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou obviously live somewhere where it's not unusual to leave your door unlocked. But presumably that's built up from generations of people respecting each other and trust as a result. Your trust is broken by the people who you should trust the most. Don't let them undermine your decision.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"They keep telling me there\u2019s no need for me to lock my door\" .. there is.

However uh, you may wanna put it in a bank account lol.\n\nIf you wanna keep the peace, perhaps you can get a lockable container of some sort for the cash and hide that container. Bc that way, if they find it they can't really complain about you locking it up bc why were they digging through your room looking for where you keep your money in the first place?\n\nHaving a locked door in the house that nobody other than you has the key to could be problematic in the event of emergencies. I think theyre more embarrassed about the fact their kids are thieves and wanna brush the incident under the rug, but there are some good reasons to not want the door locked all the time.", "NTA.

Comparing this to women getting assaulted is insane.", "NTA, can you get a bank account to put the money in?", "NTA. There's a clear reason for locking your door and telling you there isn't is crazy.", "NTA tell them the unlocking fee is the 150 you are still out, and if they ever steal again after it\u2019s opened they owe you double back.", "Get a safe and a lock on the door", "NTA tell them that his kids are Not allowed over until he pays back the $200 they stole. If he argues tell him you'll file theft charges against them. Put your foot down, don't let those terrible people guilt you", "Go to the bank, open an account, and deposit the money. If you are old enough for a job, you are old enough to have a bank account. Depending on where you live, you might have to have a parent on the account until you are an adult. You should not have hundreds of dollars lying around at all. You could be robbed of all of it in a break-in and those kids know you keep large sums of cash in your room and they could have told others.", "I got a cute little lockbox from a gas station that I keep stuff in, it\u2019s not the sturdiest safe but it\u2019s combination locked and made of metal, if you don\u2019t want to/can\u2019t get a bank account that might be an option. Even if they pry it open you can tell if it\u2019s been tampered with and that\u2019s all you need to take as proof to your ma or anyone else, maybe even hide the lock box for good measure or get a hideyhole book that you can put it in. Make sure it\u2019s a boring ass book so they don\u2019t see any reason to pick it up lol", "NTA. Cash App  has cards now. Maybe you can find a compatible atm so you don't have to carry cash in your room. Still lock your door though, they probably won't stop at money.", "NTA- Trust is broken it's hard to repair and most of the time you still see all the cracks", "NTA. Their children stole at least $200 from you. I wouldn't let them in my room either.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell your folks if could fit my entire room in a safe, I\u2019d do it.", "You need to get a bank account. NTA", "Definitely NTA. I would do the same. Not only that, they shouldn't be in your room anyways so why are they offended?", "Def NTA", "NTA\n\nThe question is why do they even know the door is locked? unless they were trying to get in\u2026\n \nyou should definitely try talking to your parents, mom and dad alone about how much money you have truly lost and what goals you were trying to reach and how much your work has suffered because they stole?? \n\nhow old are these kids??? and how tf did no one question the amounts of money or them being in your room without you there????\n\nIn the end they stole significant amounts of hard work from someone that is there own family and clearly used to trust them in their personal space, they lose that privilege as a consequence but you should definitely be compensated for more or they should at least face an actual reasonable punishment for their consequences.\n\nLike: 1. Retuning anything they have gotten with your money and give u whats returned , 2. Working for an allowance to pay you back, etc.", "They should be grateful you didn\u2019t turn them in!!!!!", "What story did you read???", "Do you think that your dad\u2019s wife could\u2019ve coerced the children into doing something malicious like that? and did you by any chance keep track of how much money you lost after each visit?", "Yeah, wouldn't surprise me if they did know/guess and were just going for (im)plausible deniability there.", "Then NTA.", "Damn you're dense if you think suggesting a bank account is equivalent to victim blaming. Maybe take some time to actually learn what it is before making problematic remarks?", "I don't think that's what they intended to be fair, but I feel ya. Especially when you have kids you know have stolen from you before it's a good idea to keep it somewhere they have zero access to it from now on so it's good idea to mention to op since clearly they can't be trusted, but it's in no way op's fault for keeping cash. There's the expectation of safety in your own home and it shouldn't be risky", "Your downpost score says otherwise", "Nta. They still owe you $150", "Time to go and open a bank account. Then you can deposit you money and it will be good and safe from sticky fingers. They will go back to stealing it. You will have your bank card on you at all times so there's that too.", "NTA", "Oh my gosh. first off, those kids absolutely need to pay back every cent themselves, either directly to you, or to their parents who should give or already have given you the full amount taken. Second, why in the world are you keeping money in your bedroom when you know those little thieves can get it?Open a bank account and deposit your money there. Yeah, you SHOULD be able to just leave money in your bedroom, but obviously you can\u2019t.And yes, it\u2019s completely reasonable to lock your door at all times. Absolutely. Who knows what else those little criminals will steal.", "Tell them when they cover the rest of what their sweet little angels stole you'll go back to unlocking the door.  Until then, the little demons are staying locked out.  NTA.", "NTA. They didn\u2019t just pick up a $20 that someone dropped on the ground. Those little thieves dug through your stuff multiple times to find and take your money. I\u2019d never trust those f**kers in my room again.", "NTA. \"You stole from me so now I don't trust you\" is about as mild of a \"found out\" as one could imagine.", "Also, why is your father, let alone his new family, coming over to your and your mom\u2019s house? Is it to visit you? that seems really odd. I would think you would go to their house or meet at a neutral location.", "Get a bank account nta", "NTA. My parents had a no lockable doors policy but the minute one of us started stealing from the others (drug addict) we all got lockable doors. It\u2019s not reasonable for them to expect you to still trust when that trust has been broken.", "How do they know you\u2019re locking your door unless someone is tying to get in there???", "Don't believe they didn't know. You already brought to their attention that you were missing money, and they said they didn't take it, and yet they're surprised when they saw the children taking it. They never suspected it was the kids. Again, don't believe it.", "Honestly... How'd they know the room was locked? Not like you can easily tell from the outside of a locked door. Unless you try to open it.", "Ding ding ding. They absolutely were never going to apologise and admit their kids were stealing if you hadn\u2019t caught them in the act.", "These two things are not the same\n\n1. That may not stop the bad guys. You may also want to take this additional precaution.\n\n2. You didn't do enough to prevent yourself from being victimized, so it's your fault.", "NTA. You just need to tell them that you appreciate the very expensive lesson. They taught you that you need to lock your stuff up.\n\nThis might just be dad me but have you looked into opening a bank account?", "NTA~ They should not care if you lock your door or not. If the kids won\u2019t do it again then there should be no problem with locking your door for your peace of mind.", "don't see how you could be. Haven't read, prolly won't. On God", "Suggesting a way to do something safer isn't victim blaming. A better comparison would be walking alone in the dark, sure women should be able to do that, and it wouldn't be her fault if she got attacked doing that, but it's much safer to just not walk around alone in the dark", "NTA. So you had been asking your family about your missing money and your Dad did not mention that his kids had been coming home with unexplained money?\n\nSounds like your Dad's name might be Fagin.", "NTA", "NTA. wth.. give back all or get lost", "The only thing I can see is if someone comes in to clean up or take the laundry basket of whatever but they still can wait or ask for it when  op is there.", "Does the court order include his wife? It would be great if she'd stay home", "Gosh I don't know why you don't want to spend time around these lovely examples of humanity.", "NTA, it\u2019s your room. But also get a bank account.", "NTA, you're probably out more than you think.\n\nGet a bank account.", "NTA they still owe you $150", "No", "NTA. If they make sure their kids don't go near your room, it doesn't matter if your door is locked.", "NTA Your siblings literally stole your hard earned money for you, they are just mad they can\u2019t do it again, good on you for keeping your stuff safe."]}
