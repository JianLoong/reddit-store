Afterwards dad married his mistress and mom stayed single but made her way up and was able to provide me and my siblings a good life. As of late i\u2019ve been working as a waitress. I want to buy a car but doing chores aren\u2019t enough and my mom wouldn\u2019t give me any extra chores so i took the job. So i started saving my checks and tips. Every other weekend my dad and his family has been coming over. Lately tho i\u2019ve started noticing that my money has been going missing. It started with 1 or 5 dollars missing but it\u2019s gotten aggressively more. Like 20-30 dollars are missing. My savings has gone from around 500 to roughly 300. I brought this up to my family but they expressed on multiple occasions they haven\u2019t taken it. I tried putting it in different places but it still goes missing. \n\nI caught my dads kids hanging around my room and sitting outside of it. I asked them to stay away from my room but they get offended and tell their mom that i don\u2019t wanna hang out with them; always ends in an argument. 3-4 weeks ago when i got home from work they were in my room and taking money from my savings i yelled at them to put the money back and to get out of my room. My dad and their mom heard me yelling and came up to see what was I yelling about. They were on my side and grounded them. Apparently their kids have been taking my money and they explained that they have been coming home with money but they had no idea where they got it from and gave me a 50 as an apology. \n\nNow whenever i go out i started locking my door. I mean every day even when their not there i look my door. They started taking offense to this. They keep telling me there\u2019s no need for me to lock my door and that they make sure that their kids aren\u2019t around my room anymore but like i lost so much money from this. They didn\u2019t work those 8 hours shift i did and they got the money from it. But its like their kids they didn\u2019t know any better. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692784317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yz61k/aita_for_locking_my_door_when_i_go_out/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad and stepmom should have had the kids give back all the money taken or replaced themselves. Not just $50 as an apology, they still owe you about $150. Keeping your door locked is reasonable to me.", "NTA\nIts your money and they should respect that. The fact they are taking offence rather than re-paying you is actually worrying. Keep your door locked girl", "NTA, you never even got compensated fairly. If the kids won\u2019t steal anymore there is also no reason as to why they should be in your room anyway, it\u2019s your room and you deserve privacy. Stand your ground on this one, they have no reason to enter your room", "Absolutely NTA.  Also- can you get a savings account to put that cash into? What exactly did your family do when you caught the kids stealing?", "NTA .\n\nI did the same thing after I caught one of my siblings stealing money from my room. To make matters worse my sister only stole coins I had saved for years (by this I mean collectible coins, collected through average transactions) and spent them all on things my mom also willingly gave her money for.\n\nWhen I put a lock on my door the bullying persisted for weeks. It was only because they couldn't steal from me anymore. They never intended to stop. My mom even told me last year she was angry because if my sister could take money from me, then she asks my mom for less. So. Don't let them bully you or make you feel bad. If it makes them feel bad about themselves they need to do some self reflecting and maybe work on themselves a lot.\n\nEdit to fix some spelling as I was half asleep this morning when I responded sorry.", "NTA.\n \nThey\u2019re lucky all you\u2019re doing is locking a door. \u2014 I\u2019d call the cops if it continues \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. And how exactly do they know you are STILL locking the door after they gave you the guilt $50? Do they see you do it, or is it because someone is still attempting to open the door when you aren\u2019t there?\n\nEither way it doesn\u2019t matter. They need to explain to their kids that actions have consequences and that trust takes time to re establish once broken. These are life basics.", "So your dad brings his new wife and kids to your mom\u2019s house to visit??? Your mom is a saint to allow this. \n\nOf course you\u2019ll lock your door. Those kids have stolen $200 from you, and your dad gave you $50 as recompense. Still owes you $150. \n\nNTA. \n\nTell your dad and his mistress wife they can be as offended as they want to be. Their children\u2019s actions have proven it\u2019s necessary and they still owe you $150.", "NTA. Remind them they still owe you about $200.\n\nGotta admit, I'm confused as to why your Dad & stepmother/mistress are coming over to your Mom's house so often?", "NTA, I too would lock my door. They can be offended all they like, it's the smart thing to do", "NTA - Your room, your lock.  They have already proved to be thieves and guaranteed they aren't the least bit concerned their parents will really ever stop them and they are right.", "NTA\n\nOne of the unfortunate things about having your privacy/space/money violated is that after that first time, you never fully get the feeling of security back. Plus, they've already proven that they can't be trusted to control their children (because who just lets their kids come back with money and not question it??), and won't fully compensate your for any damages (because $50 doesn't sound like everything the lil gremlins stole), and beyond just them and their kids it's not unreasonable to be concerned that something might happen and to just not want people in your space. If it gets to the point of being a compulsion, like you start getting paranoid about it, it would be worth talking to someone about it/working on it. Make sure your mom has a key for emergencies and everything should be fine?\n\nHow old are the younger kids, by the way? Because if they're like <6 you're right they probably don't know better, but any older and they shoudl know better and their parents should have taught them properly lol", "NTA\n\nThey raised thieves and they still owe you $150. They need to pay it and take the time to actually raise children who don't steal. You preventing their thieves from stealing you reminds them daily that they aren't doing a good enough job parenting their children. Keep at it. They still owe you money, and your money clearly isn't safe with an unlocked door.\n\nBut I recommend you look into a bank account. Storing your money in your home is always going to end badly.", "NTA. \n\nA) it is your room, your half siblings have no reasons to be in there, if they are not even living in the same house.\n\nB) Don't know how old they are but it sounds they know what money is and even were looking for it in the first place. So they should know that they were stealing and that this is wrong. So they have to suffer the consequences and that you won't trust them anymore, won't play with them and don't do anything with them is the least consequence\n\nC) If your dad and his new wife think it was 'just a little money' then they should give you the full amount of money back. And then you can consider if you want to play with your half siblings again\n\nD) Your dad and his wife saw that the kids had money no one knew where it came from. And they had no idea to ask you and your mothers side of the family if the gave it to them or are missing something. Sounds like your dad had no problem with your half siblings stealing from you as long as you had no prove\n\nSo no. Don't open your room up to them. And also consider if this is a reason that your half siblings should be banned from your house for a few months (talk to your mother). Because if they steal from you, who knows if they aren't stealing from the rest of the family as well", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou obviously live somewhere where it's not unusual to leave your door unlocked. But presumably that's built up from generations of people respecting each other and trust as a result. Your trust is broken by the people who you should trust the most. Don't let them undermine your decision.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"They keep telling me there\u2019s no need for me to lock my door\" .. there is. THEIR kids sotle your money, and you are keeping that from reoccuring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: YOur dad and his wife are AHs, you were not even repaid, but fobbed off with 50$.", "NTA it\u2019s your private space, and it\u2019s been invaded and they\u2019ve rummaged through your belongings and stolen from you, your dad and stepmom won\u2019t be there to watch the kids all the time.\n\nKeep locking the door", "NTA, its a valid fear that they'll do it again. However uh, you may wanna put it in a bank account lol.\n\nIf you wanna keep the peace, perhaps you can get a lockable container of some sort for the cash and hide that container. Bc that way, if they find it they can't really complain about you locking it up bc why were they digging through your room looking for where you keep your money in the first place?\n\nHaving a locked door in the house that nobody other than you has the key to could be problematic in the event of emergencies. I think theyre more embarrassed about the fact their kids are thieves and wanna brush the incident under the rug, but there are some good reasons to not want the door locked all the time.", "NTA. What difference does it make to them if they don't intend to go in your room?", "Have you heard of this new invention called a bank ? NTA but banks exist for a reason", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
