{"id": 6240, "submission_id": "100vheg", "title": "AITA for re-gifting my boyfriend's Christmas present ($1300 laptop) to my sister?", "selftext": "I (23F) love my boyfriend (24M) and have been dating him for about two years. He has always been really supportive, and our relationship is great, so when it came time for Christmas, I wanted to get him something really special.\n\nHe has been complaining about his laptop for a while and has expressed the desire to upgrade to a newer model. I decided I would surprise him with a brand new laptop for Christmas.\n\nI wanted to get him the best laptop I could, so for the weeks leading up to Christmas, when he'd complain about his laptop, I'd take these opportunities to casually ask him which laptop he liked, what he wanted in a new laptop, and so on. The main problem he had with his laptop was the speed. So, I thought it would be fitting to get him the same model that he had (MacBook Pro), just the latest version.\n\nNow, I'm not a tech person. I don't know the first thing about RAM, SSD, etc. I just assumed a $1300 laptop would be more than enough for his needs. So I bought the laptop, without doing any more research into it.\n\nChristmas day came and I gave my boyfriend the laptop. He was so excited, until he saw the specs. When he saw that the laptop had 8GB of RAM, he was really, really disappointed because he \"couldn't get his work done on such a slow machine\". He was adamant that he needed something with more RAM. \n\nThis turned into a full blown argument. I tried to explain to him that I had done my best and spent a lot of money on the laptop, so he should appreciate it, but he wasn't having it. He said he would rather return the laptop and get the one he wanted.\n\nAt this point, I was really hurt and upset. I had gone out of my way to get him a really nice present, and I felt like he didn't appreciate it at all. Yes, I could return it, and get him the one he wanted, but I had already spent a lot of money. The fact that he wasn't even willing to give it a chance made me really frustrated.\n\nSo long story short, I decided to re-gift the laptop to my sister (19F). She's a college student, and I know she could really use a laptop like this. I know it may sound selfish, but I didn't think it was fair that he didn't appreciate my gift, and I wanted to make sure the laptop went to someone that would actually appreciate it.\n\nMy boyfriend is, to put it bluntly, pissed. He \"does not understand why I wouldn't just return it and get him the one he wanted\" and \"cannot believe I would do something so selfish when I know how much he needs a new laptop\". I feel kind of bad, but at the same time, this wasn't cheap for me, and a little appreciation would have been nice.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672612253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100vheg/aita_for_regifting_my_boyfriends_christmas/", "score": 6472, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Imagine you drive a crappy old car to work. It\u2019s falling apart. You often complain to you boyfriend how crappy it is and how it barely gets you to your job, a 30 minute car ride away. Your boyfriend picks up on this and decides to surprise you for Christmas with a brand new bike. Sure, it\u2019s nice and very thoughtful but it\u2019s not what you need to get to work. \u201cBut just give it a chance!\u201d No, giving a bike the chance to be a car isn\u2019t realistic. It\u2019s just not the right gift. \n\nYTA. You meant well but your gift was not what he needed. You could have offered to return it and get a gift card to the computer shop so he could put the money towards something more expensive that fits his needs, but instead you threw a fit and gave it away. Think a little next time before you react. There\u2019s often another, more reasonable solution.\n\nEDIT - Thank you for the awards! I\u2019ve never gotten awards before so I might be gushing a little inside right now. :)", "YTA. It sounds like your boyfriend WAS appreciative, but understandably disappointed when he realized the laptop wouldn\u2019t meet his needs.  Instead of accepting that he actually knows which specs his work requires, you decided to argue with him that he was wrong about what he needs.  You, who admittedly \u201cdoesn\u2019t know the first thing about RAM, SSD, etc.\u201d and who bought the laptop \u201cwithout doing any more research into it.\u201d  You could have easily saved the day by returning the laptop and letting him use the return value toward a laptop that meets his needs, but it sounds like you just let your ego get in the way.", "YTA- I\u2019m going to put it in different terms for you because people are spouting off specs and tech talk that you clearly don\u2019t understand so I can see why you may be frustrated.\n\nSay you bought your boyfriend a new sweater. It was beautiful and expensive and your boyfriend was so grateful but there was one problem. You bought the sweater in a size small and your boyfriend is an XL. There is no way he can fit into it, no way that he can make it work for him. But you keep insisting that he just try to squeeze into it while he knows he won\u2019t be able to get even a sleeve on. He loves the sweater and the thought that you put into it so he suggests that he can just exchange it for a bigger size that will fit him. Reasonable right? But no, you fly into a rage because you don\u2019t believe that he knows his own size. You think he\u2019s ungrateful for wanting something that will fit so you take away his gift and throw it at someone else. Do you see how childish that sounds?", "Soft YTA. You seem to be placing more importance on your own need to feel validated in your gift-giving, rather than wanting to make sure your gift will actually be useful and appreciated. \n\nI can understand why you would feel hurt and disappointed that your gift didn't have the intended effect, especially after putting a lot of money into it, but... the gift was intended to fill a specific need in your bf's life, and it doesn't meet that need. He shouldn't have to try to make do with inadequate equipment just because you spent a lot of money on it without doing further research. Since you knew you didn't have a lot of knowledge about what specifically he would need, a better idea may have been a gift card or money to put towards a laptop that he could pick out himself based on what he knows he needs and will use it for.  Giving the laptop to your sister isn't the answer here.", "YTA\n\nYour boyfriend sounds like he was appreciative of your gift, but he needed a machine that can do what he needs it too. That's the risk of getting a laptop or something similar (cars etc.) without the involvement of the person you're buying it for. The correct action would have been returning the laptop and allowing him to put the money towards a machine that fits his needs.\n\nNot to mention, once you gift something - it doesn't belong to you anymore. It was his laptop and you took it to gift to your sister.", "YTA who spends 1.3k on a laptop without even doing the research that it\u2019ll actually perform for its purpose. The effort was half-assed and when he got upset you just gave his gift away. You should have returned it with your bf and he could of paid the difference to upgrade. \n\nMy job got me a 8GB RAM MacBook and they also had to upgrade bc it didn\u2019t work for my needs. For some tasks 8GB is useless.", "YTA.  Sometimes we put a lot of thought into a present that just doesn\u2019t work for the receiver.  They can still appreciate the gift, thought, and effort while kindly acknowledging that they cannot use it.  \n\nI have a very niche hobby.  I love when people try to buy me things for my hobby, but it\u2019s almost never something I can use.  Unless you\u2019re in the hobby, there\u2019s no way you can have the knowledge needed to buy me something useful. So I appreciate the thought, and I return the gift so that I can get something I\u2019ll actually use.  I consider that the gift then, and I think of the person when I use it.  \n\nWhen I give a gift, I want the receiver to get use out of it.  If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t for any reason, then I want them to return it and get something they will use.  That\u2019s what should have happened here.  Because of your insecurity and need for validation, you missed an opportunity to go with your BF to the store to pick out the laptop that he could use. As so many people have explained, there\u2019s no need for him to try your gift out when the technical specs don\u2019t work for his needs.  Taking the gift back and giving it to someone else was so wrong.  Don\u2019t be surprised if this ruins your relationship.", "YTA. \n\nNothing you described sounds like he was unappreciative.   There\u2019s no reason for him to \u201ctry out\u201d a laptop that he knows doesn\u2019t meet his needs. \nIt would have been perfectly reasonable for him to go exchange the one you got and pay the difference to upgrade. \n\nYou acted like a baby.", "YTA.\n\nMinimum specs for a computer to do a job are a thing. And 8MB is not so much anymore. \n\nIf you\u2019re not a tech person, the thing to do is to either talk with your partner about this highly technical gift beforehand and figure out what he needs.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t regift, you took his gift back and gave it to your sister.\n\nThat was a generous gift but it didn\u2019t meet his needs. You should have went with him to exchange it and let him pay for the upgrade. I think that would have been fair and everyone would have been happy.\n\nTime for an apology.", "YTA. \nI know your heart was in the right place but under no circumstances should you drop that amount of cash without doing research and making sure it\u2019s the gift he wants.", "You were thoughtful but a bit misguided. You want him to enjoy your gift, right? So what was the problem with him returning it to replace it with a different laptop that meets his needs? That\u2019s literally what gift receipts are for. The new laptop is still your gift to him, he would still be grateful to you. I can\u2019t understand why you would be offended by that. YTA.", "YTA. Do not buy people expensive gifts without consulting them (as in directly, no surprises) first. Also, do not buy things that people tend to be particular about. Most people want to pick out their phone, laptop, musical instrument, backpack, things that they're going to be using every day and they want to pick out in detail according to their needs. Be careful with gifts like that. He didn't sound unappreciative from your description, it just sounded like it didn't fit his needs.", "YTA. He didn\u2019t even sound unappreciated, I don\u2019t understand why you couldn\u2019t just return it and get a new one (suggestion: you chip in the original $1300 you spent on the laptop, and he can chip in for whatever amount is left considering it may be more expensive since it has a bigger upgrade) My sister just got my dad a shirt that doesn\u2019t fit for Christmas, he was appreciative but kindly told her, this doesn\u2019t fit me, so what did she do? She returned it and got the correct size. If you knew your boyfriend needed a laptop so badly, which yes can be pretty hard to understand on what specifics he needs, you could\u2019ve asked in subtle ways or taken more time to listen to what he really wanted. Should\u2019ve just returned it, instead you made it a bigger problem then it had to be. It\u2019s not like he said the gift sucked. He needs it with the better upgrades to work. You would\u2019ve been REALLY disappointed if he just kept it and didn\u2019t end up using it because he can\u2019t get his work done properly on it.", "YTA. This isn't regifting. That's when someone gives a gift TO YOU that you give to someone else. This sounds like you stole a laptop from your bf and gave it to your sister.", "You done goofed. Yta. He appreciated it, I also know nothing about computer specs so I understand that you thought more expensive = better, but you should have asked for help.", "Yeah YTA. You gave him the gift and you let your emotions get the better of you because he was truthful.", "YTA - he appreciated your gift, it just wouldn\u2019t work for his needs.  You could have returned it and put $1300 towards one he picked out that would work.  Why TF would he want to keep a laptop he couldn\u2019t use?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019ll be honest, this is something a narcissist does. They do something you don\u2019t want done then get mad that you don\u2019t appreciate it. Why would you want to waste that much money on something he can\u2019t use?", "I'm sorry to say soft YTA\n\nWith any kind of specialized gift, if you don't know much about it then you should get a gift card or give cash or something, and get input from someone who does know. I had to shell out for a new laptop in college to run the programs I needed to, and it was over $2000 -- and still not the highest end one I could've gotten, either. I settled a bit to not hurt the wallet as bad.\n\nIt sounds like he liked the idea of the gift and the effort that you put in, but that it just genuinely wouldn't be what he needed. Taking it back and giving him the money you spent on this one to go towards a better laptop would be the sensible thing to do, imo. Although it's kind of you to gift it to your sister instead, it does leave him without a gift at all, so I can see why he's upset...", "YTA\nI had something similar happen with my husband but with headphones for his PC gaming. I got him a gift which was expensive. He tried it but it wasn't as good as the one he found that was (get this) $50 cheap than the one I got him. So I returned the one I got and bought him the one he found. He still got a headset and I got some money back and a happy husband. \nIf he finds a laptop that is more that what you spend ask him to pay the difference as you can only spend what you spent for what you bought. \nIf he doesn't understand that then he's the asshole. \nI would see if your sister would give it back or figure out how you will apologize to your boyfriend. It wasn't worth the argument.", "YTA. On something like this that is so important for his work, you shouldn\u2019t have just guessed at what would work.

It\u2019s ok that he was disappointed, but at some point someone became angry. That person is the asshole. This could have been resolved by exchanging it and he could have contributed more money for the one he wanted.", "INFO: how did this turn into an argument and what did he say?\n\nI think it really depends on how he said the laptop wasn't good enough. You didn't deliberately screw up, but you also can't really take his tech needs personally.", "YTA\n  You bought him something that is useless to him.

Unlike this, it'd be even more rude to you if he accepted the gift and not use it, because if he already has a minimum spec for his work stuff and all, a laptop that is pricey but inadequate inside won't be useful at all to him.", "YTA\n\nYou got him something that he couldn\u2019t use. It makes sense to return it and get him something he can use.\n\nBut what did you do instead? You took his gift and gave it to someone else because he didn\u2019t lie to you and tell you that it was the one he wanted/needed. \n\nWhy would you rather he just take a gift, that you admit you didn\u2019t do enough research on, and not use it than him tell you the truth and you exchange it for the one he would actually use?\n\nIt just seems like somehow even though this was supposed to be a *gift* for *him* you\u2019ve made it all about you.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu wasted a lot of money on a piece of junk.

You bought an APPLE PRODUCT why didn\u2019t you talk to someone or go online to the hundreds of apple forums out there to research this, instead of being passive aggressive when you bought a gift you didn\u2019t know enough about?", "YTA you say you went out of your way to get him want he wanted, but you really didn't. He needed a new computer for very specific reasons, not just to watch Netflix on. You supposedly spent weeks asking him what he wanted in a laptop, and then went and bought something that is not at all what he wanted or needed. You just wanted to buy the flashy one so you could get the recognition for buying such an expensive present. \n\nListening to people and what they actually want and need is way more impressive than throwing money around.", "YTA\n\nFirstly, because after you gave it to your bf it became his laptop, and whether he appreciated it enough or not, it was no longer yours to give to someone else.\n\nSecondly, for buying an expensive gift without knowing what you were looking for and then expecting him to just\u2026use a useless gift I guess? Spending a lot of money on something he can\u2019t use is your mistake. \n\nIt makes no sense to expect him to use something that doesn\u2019t have the capability he requires, and it\u2019s even stranger to take it away and give it to someone else instead of letting him exchange it. That\u2019s a fine compromise that would allow the money you spent to go toward a machine he can use.", "Soft YTA.  You did put a lot of effort into the gift and it sounds like he was kind of dickish in not even recognizing that.  You should have let him exchange it for one that he wanted.

At least your sis is really happy.", "Info- did he expect you to pay the additional cost for an upgraded model?\n\nIf he did, I'm leaning towards not TA because that is unreasonable. \n\nHowever, if the system doesn't have the specs he needs for his use scenario, then \"give it a chance\" isn't realistic and I'd go with no AH. It's unfortunately important to understand the minimum specs for what someone needs with a technology purchase. So, while it was a nice gesture, it was also a really uninformed purchase and I think the best resolution would have been returning it and having him pay the gap for the model he needed.  For example, on the entry level 13\" (which I suspect you purchased,) you could have increased to 16g for just $200 or 24g for $400, which he could have paid.", "ESH\n\nYou wanted to get your boyfriend a nice laptop, but you didn't really know what you were doing and didn't do enough research to figure it out. I use a MacBook Pro for work, but mine costs $3k. The one you bought your boyfriend absolutely wouldn't cut it. I don't need to try it out to know that. As they say, \"when you assume, you make an _ass_ out of _u_ and _me_.\"\n\nNow, your gift wasn't right, but you were still very generous in spending $1,300 on your boyfriend. My wife never bought me anything that pricey! So you're not an asshole for getting it wrong\u2014you're just wrong.\n\nHis reaction was inappropriate. He should've shown gratitude, even if it wasn't good enough. He could've thanked you for the thought at least and asked you to exchange it or return it.\n\nI can't really blame the re-gifting in light of his response, but it definitely didn't help the relationship.

It was very rude not to appreciate the gift, even if it wasn\u2019t what he wanted. He could have politely asked to return the laptop and he put up the monetary difference between your gift and his preferred model. $1300 is a significant amount of money. \n\nYou should have communicated with him more clearly about your disappointment with his response, rather than completely giving it away.  You could have also told him you\u2019d be happy to contribute the funds towards another model. You weren\u2019t the AH until you gave it away without having a mature conversation.

I can't really give judgement without knowing if your issue was with returning the gift at all or the implication that you should pay the extra to get the better machine.

It became a thing: I appreciated the sentiment and told her I could give her some ideas for alternative gifts, but she just got mad, told me I was an ingrate, returned the gift, and kept the money.

One of the reasons why that\u2019s the case is that a well-thought out gift shouldn\u2019t cause hurt feelings on either side or in anyway burden the receiver. Necessities and expensive necessities especially are not a good opportunity for a gift. You put him in a position where he had to either use a computer that didn\u2019t fit his needs (and rapidly depreciates in exchange value the second he uses it) or be in conflict with you. You put your own self out by spending a lot of money, not having the expertise to evaluate the gift, and having expectations it would be accepted as is. There\u2019s things people need to be involved with picking out themselves. In this case if you knew he wanted a mac, deciding how much you wanted to spin and then getting a gift certificate would have been the way to go. You can make a gift certificate special by wrapping it up in a box with some small and thoughtful gifts (special candies, little framed pictures, whatever) to give the same opening experience and presentation as a physical gift. And so that parts of the gift still show individual personality. \n\n\nA perfect gift is something someone wants but would not buy themselves. This gift clearly falls under \u201cwants but would buy himself.\u201d If you\u2019re in a situation where you have the money to get something for someone that they would buy themselves if they could afford it, you must go into this with an understanding of the power-dynamic involved. Don\u2019t deprive them of the opportunity to pick it out themselves (a lot of people, maybe even most people really look forward to picking it out.) Unless they\u2019ve already picked out the exact model, color, etc. In this case surprising someone with a physical object in the box is not the important part of the gift. \n\n\nYou should avoid giving someone something that you will be resentful of if they don\u2019t use, not just for your sake but also because of the situation it puts them in. \n\n\nYou should avoid giving them something that could become a burden or a source of guilt. Like don\u2019t give people plants that could die, things that are a project, bulky objects that require a lot of space in their house, books that aren\u2019t specifically about their interests, things that break easily, or God forbid\u2026animals. \n\n\nSometimes a necessity is a good gift, if you get them a higher quality version that they wouldn\u2019t buy themselves. A lot of people like things like nice robes or socks, but don\u2019t justify buying anything better than the basic ones at Target. That way it\u2019s a useful gift that\u2019s like a treat, but not difficult incorporate into their lives since everyone uses them. \n\n\nDon\u2019t give a gift that can be interpreted as a message that they should change. Like workout equipment for someone who isn\u2019t already on some sort of, self-help books, clothes that are in your taste not theirs, etc. \n\n\nIf you\u2019re really stuck trying to figure it out, go with consumables. Wines, high quality treats, gift certificates for a massage, etc.", "Story time. So when I was 16 I became very interested in playing guitar . My beloved mother got me one for Christmas.  I was thrilled buuuut mommy dearest got what the guy suggested, which was a fairly expensive , yellow \ud83d\ude2c classical HUGE acoustic guitar. I am a small female and this monstrosity was made for a 300lb biker! It was so big I could barely reach the end of the fret board with ma little t-rex  arms, and my fingers were too short to reach across the strings. It also seemed to not be able to stay tuned.  After a couple of days, she asked why I wasn't playing it (I was stilling using one borrowed from a relative) . I felt sooooo bad that I couldn't use it or like it, but I know she spent alot of money on it, and we were not that well off . She saved hard for it, so I sat her down and GENtLy told her the truth and showed her how big it was compared to me . Seriously if ya stood the thing up the nut came almost to my throat , it looked like it was cos playing as a cello !!. She was upset for a few minutes thought I didn't appreciate it and all that but I assured her I loved her and the thought of my own guitar and that she was the best mama. After the initial shock and little education of guitar sizes and types, she calmed,  found the receipt and we had a nice mama daughter day exchanging the guitar and getting our nails done. Communication, folks!\n\nSo OP unfortunately giving away his gift without talking to him first  does make you a bit of an AH so unless you have another $1300 laying around maybe you could help him get his current PC fixed or get on a payment plan. I do also think he's a bit of an AH too he could've waited till the day after Christmas to tell you . So apologize to each other and don't be rash with expensive gifts.", "ESH. Imagine you rode horses competitively and really needed a new pair of expensive tall boots. Now imagine your BF spend hundreds of dollars to get you top of the line boots, but they were the wrong size, so you suggested exchanging them for the correct size. Would that make you ungrateful? That\u2019s essentially what happened here. The laptop you got him was great, but it didn\u2019t have the RAM he needed, so he suggested exchanging it for one that does. The only reason I say ESH is that the additional RAM would come at an additional cost - he should have just exchanged it himself and covered the additional cost rather than expecting you to, since you\u2019d already paid so much.", "YTA I can understand you are upset, but you admit you know nothing about computers, and instead of actually seeking the advice of someone who does, you bought something you thought would work and it doesn't.

Big money does not necessarily mean bigger heart/more caring of a gift. \n\nFor big purchases communication is key because I can sense there are some hurt feelings based on his reaction to the gift. Ask yourself, would you feel as strongly if it were a $100 sneakers that were the wrong size? Or $50 video game for a console he doesn\u2019t have? If so, he made you feel like he was ungrateful regardless of the gift, and that is a separate issue and you\u2019re not TA. But if it\u2019s more so because you got him a BIG gift, and it doesn\u2019t suit his needs but you\u2019re mad about it then you\u2019re kind of TA. \n\nBut also what is he doing that he needs more ram than that?? Professional video editing?

Did you want to get him what he actually needed or you just wanted props for getting whatever?

That\u2019s stealing! Regifting is when you give a gift given to you to someone else. \n\nFirst, $1300 for a Mac isn\u2019t comparable to $1300 for a PC so you\u2019re getting a lot less of a computer when you go with a Mac. \n\nNow, you\u2019re stuck with the fact that you haven\u2019t gotten your boyfriend anything.

You were an ever bigger A for giving it to your sister, so now he can\u2019t get it back without being an A to her. He was TA for not being appreciative and understanding of your lack of knowledge on those technical things. He could have been really happy and still showed his thankfulness even after finding out the specs weren\u2019t enough for what he does, and then just told you that he\u2019d exchange it for one that was.

And then, if you missed the mark, say hey, let's trade it in for what you need. \n\nIt's ok to be bummed if someone doesn't like a present you give them, but computers are a pretty big deal and something you should probably be thoughtful about, if you want a good reception. \n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nIt wasn't your laptop to regift. \n\nLet's say you were talking about how much you wanted a piece of birthstone jewelry.

However, every time, I would show him something online, and it wouldn't be fast enough.  I just don't know enough about specs.  Finally he found one that would work and we ordered it. \n\nThis is like the expensive version of receiving a shirt that doesn't fit. I'm sure her sister appreciates the laptop, but the 1300 could have gone a long way towards the computer he does need.", "Hard YTA, very hard.", "Yeah that's not \"re-gifting,\" it's \"un-gifting.\" And BF is right, it's hard to get by on 8GB these days.\n\nI'm editing to add that I do think that OP meant well and was just disappointed when she didn't get the reaction she wanted. That's understandable, but taking the laptop back and giving it away was not the solution.", "The thing that got me was the comment about \u201che didn\u2019t even give it a chance.\u201d This isn\u2019t like trying on a sweater to see if it fits! He knows what he needs to do his work. Maybe he could have approached it more gently or with more overt appreciation before explaining why it won\u2019t work for him, but she\u2019s being absurd.", "OP\u2019s reaction is ridiculous. She got the wrong size then refuses to let the bf exchange it for the correct size? I would be totally fine with it, but I would tell him that I\u2019m fine with him exchanging it, but he will need to pay the extra cost, as I already spent a lot of money. If he got all pissed off about that, then he is being unappreciative, and I would be upset at that point.", "It's like purchasing a sweater that's 2 sizes too small. The receiver of the gift then can then exchange it for the size that is desired/needed. By taking back your gift, you have removed their opportunity to make this gift/situation work for them, thus alienating them and possibly losing them for good.", "Yup agreeing with YTA. When I had to replace my laptop while in grad school I talked to as many computer experts I could to understand what I may need vs what is a \"nice to have.\" I also did tons of research online, etc. I would have done the same for a gift although probably more aggressively. I liked your approach with the initial questions, but think your response to his needs wasn't cool. He knows what he needs the most, and since you didn't do the research of course the next option would be to return for the right fit.", "It's like you bought him a pair of vans to train for a marathon - they're not quite the right tool and he can appreciate it and still use it but he wouldn't get to train for the marathon.", "Yes!! Why do people buy these heavy duty things with no involvement?! \n\nAlso, \u201cthe fact that he wasn\u2019t even willing to give it a chance\u2026\u201d I mean, what\u2019s it going to do, reflect on itself and resolve to be the best Mac it could?", "I couldn\u2019t agree more! \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about what I bought\u201d but \u201cI\u2019m offended that it was wrong for the recipient, and he told me rather than lying.\u201d Gimme a break. These are adults. A laptop is a tool. Yta.", "But he didn't want it because it wasn't perfect. And he could have just upgraded the ram. That's what people do all the time; get a basic computer & upgrade the components.    \n\nI have a general rule that I never buy anything over $200 as a gift for this reason.", "100% agree. My husband is very techy and I do not, under any circumstances, buy him tech based gifts. I'd probably pick even the wrong cable for what he likes. And every tech person is different so it's not something where you can just do some basic research and make a good guess.\n\nOP YTA but mostly for giving away the laptop. That was petty. It was a good attempt at a gift and your heart was in the right place but just regifting it because you got it wrong is what makes you in the wrong.", "I think the worst bit is OP trying to weasel out of having to return it by giving it to her sister.\n\nNow, through a petty act, it absolutely can't be returned.\n\nYTA, OP.  I know computers can be difficult to buy, but if it means so much to someone, do some research.", "You have to be joking. She didn\u2019t steal anything. She bought him something, he didn\u2019t want it, she gave it to her sister instead.", "And then the man says, \u201cWell, I spent a lot of money so stop complaining and wear the damn ring!\u201d Even though you hate it. That\u2019s what you did to your bf.", "Honestly should have just not gotten a mac.  They are horribly overpriced for the specs you get. I got a laptop for $750 7 years ago with better specs and a GPU.  It's also easier to fix and way cheaper to have it repaired.  The only reason to get a MacBook is if you need some software that only works on Apple's.  For $1300 you can get a 2060,32 gigs of ram, and a good processor with a screen that runs 144hz.  The same price on an apple gets you no GPU, 16 gigs of ram, a slightly better processor, and a screen that's only 60hz", "NTA - The BF was excited until he saw the specs, so how exactly did he say it? Was it like this isn't going to work its just as garbage as my current one or was it oh babe, thanks so much but this one is going to be too slow for my work? \n\nAlso depending on where she bought it from to return or exchange it you may have had to pay a restocking fee. I bought my mom a laptop recently and when we went to pick it up they had us sign to acknowledge the 20% restocking fee and we only had 7 days to return or exchange.", "Ram and processor speed do different things.  It sounds like he had work programs that use lots of ram.  He probably could have just added ram himself though but he might not be confident to do thst", "He did ask to exchange it. She said no and still wanted him to use it despite being unable to complete what he needed to do on it.", "Ignore the downvotes, this was the correct adult response.", "You are incorrect, not only are laptops in general difficult to upgrade due to space but the ram is built into a Mac differently. Apple products in general are made to make it extremely difficult to modify. She spent 1300 on something that isn't useful and can't be fixed because she did zero research.", "Or maybe her budget. If the cost difference between this model and the one he wanted was another 300-500 dollars maybe she's thinking 1600 plus tax plus potentially a restocking fee was too much. We don't know if the BF was willing to pay the difference", "I am reminded of the scene in Misery where Annie buys the most expensive paper at the stationery shop because she equates expensive with best, only to come home and have Paul tell her the paper's texture renders it ill-suited for ink to dry on it in a timely fashion, leading to smudging.", "Gonna make this easy for you OP. Computers work like a baking shop. Or gas in car. Or a plane. To run a computer and it\u2019s accompanying programs you have to follow non optional requirements. \n\n- to run a car, you can\u2019t put water in the gas tank and expect it to run.\n\n- to make a cake, you can\u2019t use any ingredients in any order, on any baking sheet for any temp for any duration of time. \n\n- for a 747 plane to fly, you can\u2019t use ANY engine and expect it to take off. \n\nSimply put, your boyfriend uses programs that take a lot of raw power. His current computer is not strong enough to do his work properly and efficiently. Many of these program have RAM requirements. Meaning the program  won\u2019t even work if you don\u2019t have enough Ram and if it does it will freeze your computer and slow it to a crawl.\n\n Like a cake that needs to be baked at 425 degrees Fahrenheit, he needs a computer that has a high amount of ram. I\u2019m exaggerating but you\u2019ve essentially bought him an oven that can only go to 50 degrees Fahrenheit and you expect him to \u201cgive it a chance\u201d and to bake cakes all year round with an underpowered oven that won\u2019t be able to bake any of the cakes he needs to make.", "do you know his friends? i don\u2019t know anything about computers, either, but my boyfriend wanted a new monitor for a while so i wanted to get that for christmas. i messaged one of his best friends and asked for help, since he knew way better than me. i gave him a budget and he gave me a direct link to what to get, lol. that\u2019s just an idea for next time. :)", "Not necessarily. Newer isn\u2019t always better. My mom used to love to gift my brother the new iPhones she got back in the day for renewing her two year phone contract. But the free phones always came with the lowest possible gigabytes of memory. So my brother hated them and preferred his older phone, because it had a lot more memory.  The specs can matter a lot, and a newer device can actually be less useful than an older one, depending.", "What kind of workload do you do to... be all about RAM? That sounds very specific. I'd imagine the usual tradeoff to be GPU vs CPU while making sure nothing else bottlenecks.", "That\u2019s great, but this situation sounds a little different. \n\n8GB of RAM isn\u2019t all that much these days and he may have needed more for it to be useful. If it wasn\u2019t going to be enough then it\u2019d have just sat in the cupboard and he\u2019d have to get one himself anyone. OP could\u2019ve taken it back and let him pay the difference for the 8/16GB. \n\nIf he\u2019d bought her a dress that was too small, would it have been ok for him to kick off and give it to his sister instead? \n\nSounds like she was more bothered about him being grateful than happy.", "Yeah I have no idea why Christmas presents have to be a surprise.  I guess it's so the gifter can feel good with the reaction.", "People want to plan surprises without doing the work to research or taking the risk of someone not liking it. If you want to guess you have to be ready to guess wrong, if you want to be absolutely sure they'll love something let go of the surprise and ask them.\n\nIf she really wanted to get the right one she would have talked to someone who knows enough about computers to give advice or ask some leading questions about what was wrong with his computer besides \"slow\".", "lol I love a good analogy, nice one", "You aren\u2019t going to beat the M2 without sacrificing energy for power or power for energy for that price.", "Yeah also, like, what constitutes \"expensive\" really changes a lot based on needs and preferences. I haven't spent less than $1300 on a laptop since I swapped to laptops from my original desktop. I game and I want a good experience and a machine with a little longevity so I shell out for good specs.", "I bought my most recent laptop in person because all the online markets seem to be flooded with sketchy, scammy \"warehouse upgraded\" laptops with outlandish specs and prices that are way too low. I don't know about every in person tech store, but the Microcenter I went to it was like a full blown concierge experience - greeted the moment I walked into the computer section, asked what I was looking for (I had admittedly already preidentified just what I wanted), answered my questions about upgrading the RAM very knowledgeably, and they even have their staff meet you at the register with the machine.\n\nSo yeah, OP, definitely should have made a fun event out of it instead of assuming you knew what your bf needed when you seem to have limited technological expertise in this area.", "She got him a tricycle basically", "I was kinda wondering that myself.  The only apple product I own is an iPad, I don\u2019t do mac, so kinda clueless.

The made clear the one he got wouldnt meet his needs so asked to exchange that for one that would.\n\nIf someone got you a sweater that you loved which was 5 sizes too big or foundation ou needed several shades too dark, nobody would consider you ungrateful if you wanted to exchange it.\n\nIt is the same with his computer.", "Some laptops can be upgraded. I specifically picked some out for my kids that can be upgraded down the road. Added more ram right off the bat as well because it was cheaper to buy the RAM separately and put in myself than to pay for the same machine to come with more RAM. Still can add more RAM later though.", "Ah.  I missed the MacBook part. Yeah, they are a pain. Well then, he should still suck it up and make the best of the gift.

Otherwise it feeds to the hdd and turns portions of your hdd into virtual memory which is magnitudes of 100x slower. Visual studio, SSMS, sql developer, etc the 3 tools someone on a Microsoft stack would be using wouldn't be able to run at 8gb without endpoints taking literal decades to startup. Similar Java ides and stacks would require the same. I would love to see how long your automated unit tests take or your building of dbsets. 16gb was standard for software engineering back in 2015. 32gb is the standard since 2020. I can't imagine using 8gb right now for any type of software engineering. I know the government issues 32gb minimum since 2020 for their software engineers. \n\nSource - software architect who's designed software with extremely time sensitive response requirements.", "Oh, for sure.

Yes, it is an expensive gift for the avg person to receive. But it doesn't mean it was irresponsible. Last, there is nothing in her post that says he expects her to buy another one. It's only about how she handled the situation. The price tag, in my opinion, is irrelevant. Some people see the price and have high expectations all because it was expensive. So the idea of spending a lot of money and not getting the reaction she expected/hoped-for caused her to be upset. At the end of the day It's about what she did with his gift afterward.
