{"id": 16198, "submission_id": "135fwvr", "title": "AITA for calling my sister crazy after she came to me already emotional and saying she lives in a fantasy world?", "selftext": "This happened a week ago. BG first: My sister was married to Henry and had three kids with him. My nephew Noah who is now 12, my niece Ella who is 10 and my niece Belle who is 9. Henry and my sister divorced when Belle was born and Henry dropped from the kids' lives and was never heard from again. He wasn't a great father beforehand anyway but it was hard for my sister and the kids, who did struggle.\n\nWhen Noah was 6 he started having issues with this boy Adam. From what I heard, they just rubbed each other the wrong way and disliked each other. My sister would get notes home from the school saying they had argued and just to be mindful. This continued for a couple of years until my sister and Adam's dad were called into the office a few times because the boys arguing got more disruptive. From there my sister and Adam's dad, Mike, hit it off. Mike has Adam who is also 12, Emma who is 9 and Amy who is 7.\n\nMy sister and Mike ended up dating and then marrying. At the time I thought it was crazy because my sister seemed to have the opinion that they would end up with a Brady Bunch style blended family and everyone would be super close. That is not how things went.\n\nNow, to be fair, Noah and Adam don't hate each other now. They aren't close, like at all, but they are civil. I don't think they will ever like each other but the house is no war zone. The fighting in school stopped. They just merely tolerate the existence of the other.\n\nMy sister was upset to learn that neither Noah nor Adam considers the other family, that they don't want to hang out and be friends, that they don't really care about the other person and would choose not to spend time together at all if it were left to them. This came up because my sister and Mike wanted to send the boys to the same summer camp this year. The boys didn't want to go with each other. Mike asked why and they said they would rather do their own thing and not have the other with them for the whole summer because it's bad enough living together. My sister already knew the boys didn't do stuff together and were closer to their bio sisters than each other. But hearing them both say it was bad enough living together made her upset.\n\nShe came to me. She told me she had thought once they weren't fighting they were starting to love each other. She also explicitly said that family isn't supposed to dislike each other and becoming brothers should have erased any animosity or dislike they had for each other. I was trying to be sympathetic and compassionate to her but the more she cried over it the more I just felt like she was living this fantasy. When she told me she honestly thought they loved each other by the time she and Mike were married, I told her she was crazy and living in some weird fantasy. I told her Noah and Adam didn't choose that, they were just along for the ride and she had a very weird idea of how human emotions and bonds work. She told me I didn't need to be so mean.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683019178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135fwvr/aita_for_calling_my_sister_crazy_after_she_came/", "score": 544, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like I understand expecting them to not fight all the time over everything but love isn't something that switches on because you live together.", "Exactly. Or even being expected to view your college roommate as family. My sister hated hers and they lived together. The fact she sees the boys differently when their issues came before she and Mike married, it's insanity to me.", "She thought that being family would mean family love would kick in, and would erase all the past stuff between them. Like she straight up believed that. Still doesn't understand how it didn't work that way.", "Pretty sure they did. It just didn't mean they liked each other after it stopped. But she thought that was enough to go from dislike/hate to love/brothers since they were living together as brothers (to quote her).", "My sister and Mike. They were under the Disney impression that they would love each other then because of the marriage between the adults and would be brothers for life.", "\u201cAccepting their fate\u201d is an excellent description.", "But they arent family\nTheyre just the child of \"that lady my dad married\" or \"that man my mom married\". Ill never understand how people manage to forget how kids think when they live with one.", "That's at least good they addressed the original issue but still, sis is being naive and ridiculous if she thinks they'll just get past it because she shacked up with the other boys daddy", "That's not how my sister and Mike see it. And they're upset that the boys do see it that way.", "That's how I feel. Like I knew she had high expectations when she married Mike. I didn't realize just how much of a fantasy she was living in though.", "Yeah it's totally one thing to talk to them and expect them to not want to like murder each other at school every day, but to love each other is crazy. Please make sure she gets those boys in different summer activities so they have time away from each other or she's going to have bigger problems in her hands than before", "She\u2019s delusional. Surely she\u2019ll come to you upset again when both boys move out and go NC. NTA", "Nta\n\nYour sister is delusional", "NTA, and not mean. You just gave your sister a much needed reality check. Of course, now she'll probably just force them into family therapy so they can learn that they have to love each other.", "NTA.\nJust because you are related or married into the family it doesn't mean you like each other. She should be aware of that.\nThe boys seem to be trying and from constant arguing to tolerating each other is a long way. She should be happy that they tried like this and shouldn't expect more. They're their own people and emotions and feelings don't just vanish because suddenly your parents marry...", "NTA but seriously, I read so many posts about parents who marry the parent of their kids biggest bully, and then get upset the kids don't like each other. \n\nIs that like a common trope or something?", "NTA - I assume from the context you could have had more grace while telling her, but she did infact need a reality check.", "NTA. Your is sister desilusional and needs a reality check. \n\nYou need to spell it out very clear to her. Just ask her if she is pro arranged marriages (or even worse forced marriages). Because it is the same principle for step siblings. Two people are forced to live with each other, without being able to consent and on top of that aren't even allowed their own feelings. They are expected to be happy about it and love each other. Sometimes it works out, sometimes not.\n\nEspecially given the history of animosities between the two boys she can be happy that the two boys are civil and should do everything to at least maintenan this status. If she and her husband will force them to spend more time together family life will become very unpleasant for them.", "The fact that the boys manage civil is a miracle in my view - that at 12 they\u2019re mature enough to peacefully co-exist? That\u2019s more than some people manage with siblings they\u2019ve been raised with since being babies \n\nINFO: were you and your sister super close as kids? Does she have only one model of how siblings are and assume that it\u2019ll be replicated by all siblings regardless of how they are related and when that relationship is formed?", "[Wow I didn't think this actually happened.](https://pbfcomics.com/comics/bully/)\n\n(Warning: that one's OK but other comics there may be NSFW.)", "NTA\n\nThis subreddit is littered with step-parents who think that families are automatic, and that parentship is owed once the marriage happens.\n\nGood on you for pulling off her blinders.", "NTA - Your sister and Mike are AH for thinking that the two boys who actively disliked each other would simply move on and accept that they had to live together now. I mean they should be lucky that the boys simply tolerate each other and that it never escalated to fighting or assault between the two.", "NTA your sister needed a reality check and you gave her one\u2026 with love and no intention to hurt. As long as you said it with love I call the play safe.", "If real NTA but this sounds just like a couple other posts in the last month where single parents meet because their kids are antagonizing each other\u2026", "NTA. Could you have been less harsh? Yes. But she is delusional and living in a fantasy world. And she did need to have a reality check. \n\nAlso I can't imagine hooking up the the parent of the kid your own child has had a years long feud with. Like how inconsiderate lol.", "Nta- anyone else think it's a fucking miracle the boys were mature enough to let the pettiness go and just be indifferent to each other?", "Nta. Your sister needs a reality check", "NTA\n\nAs someone who has no love for their full biological sibling, I thought you were rather kind to your sister.\n\nSome people just say it\u2019s mean when you don\u2019t tell them what they want to hear.\n\nI mean honestly, she\u2019s fucking lucky the two boys now will at least tolerate each other. Marrying the father of the boy your son doesn\u2019t get along with - sheesh.", "That's at least good they addressed the original issue but still", "The boys tried to tell her, but were silenced.", "I hate people like your sister. I know that is strong but I do loathe people that think marriage is like a fairy tale wand that will magically make problems disappear and everything will be wonderful. Marriage changes nothing but your last name and tax status. It is delusional.", "> She also explicitly said that family isn't supposed to dislike each other\n\nOne of my favorite quotes from the movie Home for the Holidays the main character tells her sister, \"Well, we don't have to like each other, Jo. We're family.\" It just hit me because there are members of my own family who I don't like. I don't hate them but I don't like them. I still care what happens to them because they are family but I don't love them. And that's okay. Being family doesn't magically make you all lovey-dovey and happy happy happy.  (By the way, the main family member I don't like is because he has been a bully a lot of his life. And he's never said sorry.)", "Soft YTA. She's right, you didn't have to be so mean. You're correct about her expectations, but you could have expressed yourself differently. Maybe she would have been able to actually hear you if you hadn't been ridiculing her.", "NTA  My brother has three kids all biological\u2026\u2026\u2026they have NEVER gone to the same summer camp.  Why?   Because they all have different interests and personalities.  Would it be easier for him and his wife to have the kids in one spot, absolutely.  But the point of summer camp is to learn independence and enjoy yourselves.", "NTA.\n\nHow many AITA posts have we seen from people trying to emotionally force relationships onto step-parents and step-children?  There seems to be at least one every day, and the judgements are pretty consistent on this.  It just doesn't work.  Sis should take the win from the boys not hating each other, and even embrace giving them some apart time -- who knows, maybe \\*that\\* would eventually help bring them closer.", "NTA. Is there anyone growing up that your sister had issues with? Ask her could you imagine if bully Patty was brought into our family and you were told you are now sister and must like each other?", "NTA\n\nYou could have been nicer about it, but what she said was crazy.\n\nI don't think your sister realizes that not even blood siblings get along. For example, my sister and I regularly got into knock down drag out fights. Being civil is a huge step up from that.", "No, most tend to be borderline murderous.", "She married the kid he didn't like's dad, making them step brothers. What did she expect would happen?", "Man she is out there with her thinking. There is a guy who posted somewhere on reddit where he found his dad (or rather his dad found him) and turned out he had a brother. When they first met neither liked eachother. But through alot of time trial and error eventually came around. You should check out his post to see his mindset through the whole ordeal. Maybe show it to your sister so she can see something she isnt used to. A different perspective on things. Might even open her mind to how the kids feel to this even if they wont say it out loud", "NTA. Imagine your own mom moving your bully in to live with you. She's an absolutely terrible parent.", "If being family meant that everyone just loved each other and got along would aita even exit? NTA", "Ehhh, NTA but literally calling her crazy is insensitive and shell just use that to ignore anything else youre saying no matter how honest it is. She doesn't have a mental illness, she is in willful denial. I think its good to break that when people find a crack in it but you undermined that progress. You had a chance to help the boys out by getting her to accept that they have already come a long way and what she got *is* fantasy level but to expect more is not only unrealistic it could actually push them apart further and away from her for trying to force it- if she hasnt already done that. I mean if my mom married the kid in school that I hated and got in fights with and then I had to live with them- I'd be making plans to move out asap and counting the days until my 18th birthday, then never look back... or call. Her goal should be to still have a relationship with her kids when they are adults, the 'loving each other' bit is way off the chart. Just because she got married and they are technically brothers doesn't solve any issues between them. I'm sure it added issues- having to be civil out of necessity is not a healthy environment to grow up in. Poor kids. Good intentions, poor execution- but saveable.", "I'm 100% sure I read this story before. Repost?", "Nta- what was her thought process here? \"Oh these kids already clearly dont get along?", " If she and her husband will force them to spend more time together family life will become very unpleasant for them.", "She's an AH for moving her sons bully into their home to live with him. She basically wrecked that kids childhood. I'd never forgive my mom if she pulled heartless stunt like that.", "She moved her sons bully into their home to live with him. She deserves way more ridicule than op delivered.", "Ah yes, I remember how being forced to live with roommates brought us so close \u2026 to nearly offing each other. \n\nI hope they let them have their separate summer camps and suspect that giving them each space is more likely to lead to an amicable relationship than forced togetherness would.", "Yeah, she was playing with fire even getting involved with the father of her son's enemy. IMO things have turned out way better than I would have expected from OP's description. Things could have easily gone in a direction where there were two sets of 3 kids at each others' throats.\n\nNot to mention this assumption that marriage automatically has special meaning for kids that are along for the ride is the root of a large portion of step parent issues.", "She\u2019s delusional. Surely she\u2019ll come to you upset again when both boys move out and go NC. NTA", "agree", "Honestly I think your sister should be counting her lucky stars that the boys are able to coexist as peacefully as they do. Usually when you take two kids with a recent history of conflict and force them to live to together, the fights get *worse,* not better.\n\nThis goes double since I highly doubt that your sister can claim any credit for them getting along, not if she thought that \"family\" was a magic word that would solve all problems. I think it speaks well of Noah and Adam that they were apparently able to achieve that kind of truce basically on their own, under such adverse circumstances."]}
