{"id": 16198, "submission_id": "135fwvr", "title": "AITA for calling my sister crazy after she came to me already emotional and saying she lives in a fantasy world?", "selftext": "This happened a week ago. BG first: My sister was married to Henry and had three kids with him. My nephew Noah who is now 12, my niece Ella who is 10 and my niece Belle who is 9. Henry and my sister divorced when Belle was born and Henry dropped from the kids' lives and was never heard from again. He wasn't a great father beforehand anyway but it was hard for my sister and the kids, who did struggle.\n\nWhen Noah was 6 he started having issues with this boy Adam. From what I heard, they just rubbed each other the wrong way and disliked each other. My sister would get notes home from the school saying they had argued and just to be mindful. This continued for a couple of years until my sister and Adam's dad were called into the office a few times because the boys arguing got more disruptive. From there my sister and Adam's dad, Mike, hit it off. Mike has Adam who is also 12, Emma who is 9 and Amy who is 7.\n\nMy sister and Mike ended up dating and then marrying. At the time I thought it was crazy because my sister seemed to have the opinion that they would end up with a Brady Bunch style blended family and everyone would be super close. That is not how things went.\n\nNow, to be fair, Noah and Adam don't hate each other now. They aren't close, like at all, but they are civil. I don't think they will ever like each other but the house is no war zone. The fighting in school stopped. They just merely tolerate the existence of the other.\n\nMy sister was upset to learn that neither Noah nor Adam considers the other family, that they don't want to hang out and be friends, that they don't really care about the other person and would choose not to spend time together at all if it were left to them. This came up because my sister and Mike wanted to send the boys to the same summer camp this year. The boys didn't want to go with each other. Mike asked why and they said they would rather do their own thing and not have the other with them for the whole summer because it's bad enough living together. My sister already knew the boys didn't do stuff together and were closer to their bio sisters than each other. But hearing them both say it was bad enough living together made her upset.\n\nShe came to me. She told me she had thought once they weren't fighting they were starting to love each other. She also explicitly said that family isn't supposed to dislike each other and becoming brothers should have erased any animosity or dislike they had for each other. I was trying to be sympathetic and compassionate to her but the more she cried over it the more I just felt like she was living this fantasy. When she told me she honestly thought they loved each other by the time she and Mike were married, I told her she was crazy and living in some weird fantasy. I told her Noah and Adam didn't choose that, they were just along for the ride and she had a very weird idea of how human emotions and bonds work. She told me I didn't need to be so mean.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683019178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135fwvr/aita_for_calling_my_sister_crazy_after_she_came/", "score": 1361, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like I understand expecting them to not fight all the time over everything but love isn't something that switches on because you live together.", "Exactly. Or even being expected to view your college roommate as family. My sister hated hers and they lived together. The fact she sees the boys differently when their issues came before she and Mike married, it's insanity to me.", "She thought that being family would mean family love would kick in, and would erase all the past stuff between them. Like she straight up believed that. Still doesn't understand how it didn't work that way.", "Pretty sure they did. It just didn't mean they liked each other after it stopped. But she thought that was enough to go from dislike/hate to love/brothers since they were living together as brothers (to quote her).", "My sister and Mike.

And they're upset that the boys do see it that way.", "That's how I feel. Like I knew she had high expectations when she married Mike. I didn't realize just how much of a fantasy she was living in though.", "Yeah it's totally one thing to talk to them and expect them to not want to like murder each other at school every day, but to love each other is crazy. Please make sure she gets those boys in different summer activities so they have time away from each other or she's going to have bigger problems in her hands than before", "She\u2019s delusional.

Of course, now she'll probably just force them into family therapy so they can learn that they have to love each other.", "NTA.\nJust because you are related or married into the family it doesn't mean you like each other. She should be aware of that.\nThe boys seem to be trying and from constant arguing to tolerating each other is a long way. She should be happy that they tried like this and shouldn't expect more. They're their own people and emotions and feelings don't just vanish because suddenly your parents marry...", "NTA but seriously, I read so many posts about parents who marry the parent of their kids biggest bully, and then get upset the kids don't like each other. \n\nIs that like a common trope or something?", "NTA - I assume from the context you could have had more grace while telling her, but she did infact need a reality check.", "NTA. Your is sister desilusional and needs a reality check. \n\nYou need to spell it out very clear to her. Just ask her if she is pro arranged marriages (or even worse forced marriages). Because it is the same principle for step siblings. Two people are forced to live with each other, without being able to consent and on top of that aren't even allowed their own feelings. They are expected to be happy about it and love each other. Sometimes it works out, sometimes not.\n\nEspecially given the history of animosities between the two boys she can be happy that the two boys are civil and should do everything to at least maintenan this status.

That\u2019s more than some people manage with siblings they\u2019ve been raised with since being babies \n\nINFO: were you and your sister super close as kids?

I know that is strong but I do loathe people that think marriage is like a fairy tale wand that will magically make problems disappear and everything will be wonderful. Marriage changes nothing but your last name and tax status. It is delusional.", "> She also explicitly said that family isn't supposed to dislike each other\n\nOne of my favorite quotes from the movie Home for the Holidays the main character tells her sister, \"Well, we don't have to like each other, Jo. We're family.\" It just hit me because there are members of my own family who I don't like. I don't hate them but I don't like them. I still care what happens to them because they are family but I don't love them. And that's okay. Being family doesn't magically make you all lovey-dovey and happy happy happy.  (By the way, the main family member I don't like is because he has been a bully a lot of his life. And he's never said sorry.)", "Soft YTA. She's right, you didn't have to be so mean.

Why?   Because they all have different interests and personalities.  Would it be easier for him and his wife to have the kids in one spot, absolutely.  But the point of summer camp is to learn independence and enjoy yourselves.", "NTA.\n\nHow many AITA posts have we seen from people trying to emotionally force relationships onto step-parents and step-children?  There seems to be at least one every day, and the judgements are pretty consistent on this.  It just doesn't work.  Sis should take the win from the boys not hating each other, and even embrace giving them some apart time -- who knows, maybe \\*that\\* would eventually help bring them closer.", "NTA. Is there anyone growing up that your sister had issues with? Ask her could you imagine if bully Patty was brought into our family and you were told you are now sister and must like each other?", "NTA\n\nYou could have been nicer about it, but what she said was crazy.\n\nI don't think your sister realizes that not even blood siblings get along. For example, my sister and I regularly got into knock down drag out fights. Being civil is a huge step up from that.", "No, most tend to be borderline murderous.", "She married the kid he didn't like's dad, making them step brothers. What did she expect would happen?", "Man she is out there with her thinking. There is a guy who posted somewhere on reddit where he found his dad (or rather his dad found him) and turned out he had a brother. When they first met neither liked eachother. But through alot of time trial and error eventually came around. You should check out his post to see his mindset through the whole ordeal. Maybe show it to your sister so she can see something she isnt used to. A different perspective on things. Might even open her mind to how the kids feel to this even if they wont say it out loud", "NTA. Imagine your own mom moving your bully in to live with you. She's an absolutely terrible parent.", "If being family meant that everyone just loved each other and got along would aita even exit? NTA", "Ehhh, NTA but literally calling her crazy is insensitive and shell just use that to ignore anything else youre saying no matter how honest it is. She doesn't have a mental illness, she is in willful denial. I think its good to break that when people find a crack in it but you undermined that progress. You had a chance to help the boys out by getting her to accept that they have already come a long way and what she got *is* fantasy level but to expect more is not only unrealistic it could actually push them apart further and away from her for trying to force it- if she hasnt already done that. I mean if my mom married the kid in school that I hated and got in fights with and then I had to live with them- I'd be making plans to move out asap and counting the days until my 18th birthday, then never look back... or call. Her goal should be to still have a relationship with her kids when they are adults, the 'loving each other' bit is way off the chart. Just because she got married and they are technically brothers doesn't solve any issues between them. I'm sure it added issues- having to be civil out of necessity is not a healthy environment to grow up in. Poor kids. Good intentions, poor execution- but saveable.", "I'm 100% sure I read this story before.

IMO things have turned out way better than I would have expected from OP's description. Things could have easily gone in a direction where there were two sets of 3 kids at each others' throats.\n\nNot to mention this assumption that marriage automatically has special meaning for kids that are along for the ride is the root of a large portion of step parent issues.", "She\u2019s delusional. Surely she\u2019ll come to you upset again when both boys move out and go NC. NTA", "agree", "Honestly I think your sister should be counting her lucky stars that the boys are able to coexist as peacefully as they do. Usually when you take two kids with a recent history of conflict and force them to live to together, the fights get *worse,* not better.\n\nThis goes double since I highly doubt that your sister can claim any credit for them getting along, not if she thought that \"family\" was a magic word that would solve all problems. I think it speaks well of Noah and Adam that they were apparently able to achieve that kind of truce basically on their own, under such adverse circumstances.", "NTA. Sometimes the truth hurts and is difficult to accept. You sister seems unwilling to accept the truth. Sucks for her, but (in my opinion) she needed to hear it eventually.", "NTA.", "NTA. The kids are civil to each other because they both realized that continued fighting would make them both miserable so they called an uneasy truce. Nothing more. It was a cessation of hostilities. No amount of using the word family will magically change peoples feelings.", "NTA.  When 2 adults marry and bring children together, the children don't automatically consider each other family...especially when they didn't get along in the first place.  At least it appears mutual, and not a bullying situation.  But, you can't force friendship and you certainly can't enforce familial love.  It may be hard for her, but she needs to hear it.\n\nNTA", "NTA OP. Someone has to tell her the truth eventually! If no one ever tells her like it is, she will never learn. And sometimes, you need the hard truth.

Asking children to somehow validate  her attraction and turn into a family is insane thinking. How on earth would she get the idea that a whole bunch of people will get along just because she likes having sex with someone? These people have absolutely no relation to one another.

She needed a reality check. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if everyone was nice and loved each other\u201d is all well and good in stories but works doesn\u2019t work like that.", "She didn't think it would, she likely knew it wouldn't, but she wanted someone in her bed and decided her needs on this trumped those of her son. To their credit the boys are civil, but that has nothing to do with their parents and your sister doesn't like anything that threatens the fantasty she's created to make herself feel better.", "She's lucky that they are neutral towards each other now. The way their relationship started, they could easily have escalated instead and the house would have become a warzone.", "Its because people seem to think children should behave, think and feel differently than adults do.\n\nAre there any people in her life she just genuinely doesn't like?

No. And it wouldn't be reasonable for anyone to expect you to. Now, what if someone was forcing you to live with that person and no matter what you said, they ignored you so they could continue to believe you and that person were now best friends. How would that feel? Because that is what you have chosen to do to the boys. You and Mike are allowed to love each other and even get married but that doesn't mean that any other dynamic will ever change because they are just flat out different people with different personalities and different interests. They tolereate each other because they love you. That does not mean they actually like wach other.\"\n\nText her that. Text it to her so that she can re read it when she is ready to hear it.

Are couples really so caught up in each other that they are literally clueless that the world doesn't work that way??\n\nIt's just as baffling as people who are so totally dumbfounded that their new stepchildren don't consider them to be Mom or Dad.
