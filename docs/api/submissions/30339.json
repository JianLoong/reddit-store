They put their own egos aside multiple times for me, this was by far the biggest. (If it matters, we also split the father/daughter dance. First I danced with my dad and then traded off to my stepdad. It's all symbolic of course, but it felt good to everyone and we were all happy after.)", "YTA simply because you are completely ignoring what she wants. This isn't something you and her stepdad get to decide. This is not your decision. You've made this more about you and her stepdad than about what she wants.

At minimum you both could walk her down.", "NTA- usually the story goes that the absentee father insists, even though he wasn\u2019t there most of the formative years and tries to pressure the daughter who refuses.  This was really admirable of you. It\u2019s too bad you both couldn\u2019t do it. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice.", "So you and her stepfather totally ignored her wishes and decided behind her back who would walk her down the aisle?

Just talk to her", "NTA - you sound like a standup guy. \n\nI know she said no to both of you walking her down but what if you did it half way and then he did the rest of it?", "I don't think YTA for feeling like you dont deserve to walk her down the aisle as you weren't an active part of her life. Where i do think you trend into YTA territory is telling her who should actually do it. Like I absolutely do understand your reasoning but I also think just saying look I'm really honored you want me to do this but I don't feel like it's right for me to do so considering I wasn't involved in your upbringing. I do think there's probably some sort of compromise here but you also can't force her to it.", "As someone with remarried parents, you could both walk her down if she wants you to. I was walked by both my \u201cstep\u201ddad and my bio-dad. I did a father daughter dance with both as well.

Your daughter wants you there and it's her day. It would mean a lot to her. Her step-dad sounds like an awesome guy. If both your daughter and him think it's okay then it's okay. I get your point but you're missing out on making your daughter's day perfect. She might not understand your reasoning and resent you. You don't want that and neither does she. It will be a great moment for both of you. I say do it, you'll all feel better.", "It\u2019s not ur day dude do what ur told n shut up", "Had a friend in similar situation.

You thought that you hadn't \"earned\" this right,  that her stepfather would feel rejected and potentially cause a turmoil\n\nI don't agree with most comments here. Her stepfather, was the father she never had and even OP is thankful for his role in his daughter's life, so I don't think that indicates a bad relationship between SF and daughter. I would be crashed if I was parenting someone for so many years that believes I don't deserve a special place in such a milestone.

You daughter asked her to walk you down the aisle and you said no. She asked you because she wanted you to do it. Then the two men who should support her no matter what, went behind her back and decided who they think deserved to walk her down the aisle.
