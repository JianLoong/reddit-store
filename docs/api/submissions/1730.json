You aren\u2019t an asshole for putting your family and your baby first. If they want to see the baby that much, they can come to you.", "NTA, and lol, two hours? That's nothing.", "NTA your first priority is protecting your child. Covid is still in existence. RSV is going around, the Flu. Not only is it not safe to take a newborn to multiple events, it\u2019s not practical. Having to log baby items back and forth, messing up the baby\u2019s schedule over and over. Don\u2019t even get started on the rest you\u2019re probably not getting. \n\nIt\u2019s very selfish of your family members to not realize that and instead of making the trip themselves to visit your newborn and yourself who just went through childbirth, they expect you to drive 2+ hours to see them, when they are the ones wanting to see the baby. Absolutely not in the wrong here. It is not like you\u2019re living in a whole different country. It doesn\u2019t require them having to board a plane to see you. You need to stay firm, set up boundaries early and let them know if they would like to see the baby, they need to set up a time and drive to you.", "NTA. If a single one of these family members were as desperate to see the baby as they claim, they would not be putting all of the responsibility on you to bring the baby to them \u2014 they would come to the baby. Your family members are selfish at best and delusional at worst.\n\nEdited to add: Remember, nobody has a right to your child. Ever.", "NTA. I think you handled it very well. You're not cutting anyone off, you're just setting up some healthy boundaries for the safety of your newborn. Those who really want to meet her will make the drive. Otherwise they can wait until she's a little older.", "NTA it's normal to try to protect newborns from big groups,you could have informed yourself veforehand sure but well we all did mistakes with our first ones,you made the responsible choice in the end don't get guildtripped and sit that one out even if they push a couple of arguments", "NTA. \n\nTravel with a newborn sucks. Worrying about the health of a newborn sucks. \n\nDoes it suck for the 10,20, 30 people who'd like to see your baby in person? Yup. But it sucks less for each of them than it does for you. They can suck it up and see you remotely or they can suck it up and come see you, or the can suck it up and wait until it is a good time for you to see them. Those are all fair options, there's no need to put you out to satisfy their whims.", "NTA --- So it's alright for you to have to travel 2 hours with a newborn but they don't want to travel the same 2 hours it would take for them to go and see you.", "NTA\n\nYour baby your rules.\nThats how simple it can be said. \n\nIts a \"Them problem\" that they cannot make the 2 hr drive, it can never be yours.\nThey be the arses for guilting you. \n\nNext time they complain, then tell them directly, \"That is a you, problem. It can never and should never be mine.\"", "NTA, you are NEVER in the wrong for protecting your child! Remind your family that baby is fragile and you are not willing to risk baby's health, period. You KNOW how these things go... baby gets passed from person to person to person. Seriously, you are saving your baby's life by not going.", "NTA\n\n You took the time to rescind your RSVPs to the events in question. That was the right thing to do. If these family members want to meet the baby while the baby is this young, they need to make the effort to come to you. It's hard traveling with a baby. There's so much stuff you have to take with you, plus there's the risk of the baby getting sick. The baby is too young for immunizations.\n\nMaybe a good compromise would be a family zoom or Skype call. Or FaceTime, I think, if you use apple devices. Your baby is too young to travel safely and they don't want to drive for two hours to visit. They can meet the baby on a video call now, and then when you feel that the baby is old enough for safe travel, you can go see them.\n\nDon't let them bully you. Your baby's safety and health come first. Congratulations!", "NTA. \n\nTraveling with a baby is hell. It\u2019s crazy your family says the 2 hour drive is too long for them to make, but they expect you to make it. How far do they have to have their head up their own ass to not see how hypocritical that is?", "NTA. Taking care of a newborn is a huge challenge. You have legitimate concerns about immunity and a 2 hr ride could  be more like 3-4 hrs with a newborn. And if you have had some sleepless nights, it may not even be safe.\n\nA 2hr ride for people to come to your place to see the baby on the other hand is not such a big deal. I used.to drive 1.5 hrs every other weekend when I was in University to visit friends and family....\n\nJust tell them if they want to see your baby as a newborn, then come to your place. Otherwise they can wait until he/she is a little older.", "NTA Please don\u2019t take your newborn to all these events. You are protecting your baby by not going, and if they don\u2019t understand that it\u2019s their problem.", "NTA. Anyone that has had a baby should know that a baby can change any plans at anytime. I am assuming most of these family members have had babies which makes them the AH\u2019s. While they can be upset about not seeing the baby they can\u2019t be guilt tripping you about not coming. If they really want to see the baby they will make the time. Stay home and take care of your family. Congrats on the little one!", "NTA of course. It's completely normal not to want to travel with a young baby. Two hours is also not much, so it would be best if they can wait and then come to you directly. You shouldn't have to be the ones travelling to see the family.", "NTA.  You are thinking of the health and welfare of your very young baby.  If they can't make a 2 hour trip to see the baby, it doesn't sounds like they really want to see the baby that bad.", "It is typical to keep visitors limited with a newborn, especially in  winter. Most people don\u2019t travel with a newborn. \n\nThis year, pediatric hospitals are already overwhelmed with babies with RSV and Flu and Covid.

In 20 years, I have not seen an RSV season as bad as this one. Babies are coming into my unit and straight up dying.

That means that even if the baby survives covid, it will be more vulnerable to other viruses.\n\nIn addition, multiple studies show covid causes brain damage and blood microclots, increasing the risk of heart attacks and stroke. There's also a 20-30% risk of Long Covid, with lasting health problems.\n\nNone of this is good for a tiny little body to deal with. I think OP is very wise.", "Exactly.  That is an exact measure of how little the complainers care about meeting the baby and OP/hubby.", "Most infants are actually at lower risk for developing severe Covid illness and any associated complications. They have less accumulated vascular injury and different clotting processes than adults.  The biggest risk related to exposing kids to large groups under the age of 3 months is meningitis (parechovirus is currently dropping infants in the southeast) and URI infections, such as the flu and RSV. \n\nI say most because congenital conditions like sickle cell disease, cardiac anomalies, trisomy 21, and renal diseases obviously increase risk for more severe illness. In my time working in a childrens hospital, I\u2019ve never seen severe Covid illness in a young infant with a normal birth history. I also worked with adults during the first year of the pandemic, so I am in no way a Covid denier. But I find that people often take common viruses like rhinovirus or the flu for granted when it comes to little kids."]}
