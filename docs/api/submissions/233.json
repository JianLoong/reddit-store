{"id": 233, "submission_id": "yj388d", "title": "AITA for crying about my friends\u2019 joint pregnancy announcement?", "selftext": "This year I had decided to make some new friends and found a couple of other women I connected with through Facebook. I had been craving female friendship as I wasn\u2019t connected with my high school friends that much anymore. Out of all the people I met, there were two women (a little older than me, and also married like me) who I particularly liked. We start hanging out and planning fun things together. I\u2019m pretty busy with my home and work life and am not a huge texter, but regularly make time to see the girls. Recently, I\u2019ve been getting the feeling that they are closer to each other than to me, I try to shrug this feeling off as we\u2019ve all known each other for a few months and I don\u2019t want to place expectations on anyone. Last night, we were having our monthly game night when one friend Announced she\u2019s pregnant! We were overjoyed and screaming because I know this is something she was trying for a while. Once the commotion dies down, the second friend looks at both of us and also announces her pregnancy. While my first reaction was of joy, I soon (very selfishly) began to feel a little shocked at the fact that they\u2019re both going to continue to become closer friends, leaving me, once again, on my own. I\u2019ve also been wanting my partner and I to have a baby for a while, so I know my hormones might have something to do with my selfish reaction. But am I the asshole for thinking about my own companionship rather than being happy for two friends who have just shared this amazing news with me? I can\u2019t help but feel like the odd one out and excluded.\n\n*EDIT*\n\nFirst time on reddit and didn\u2019t realise that people respond so quickly! I didn\u2019t cry in front of my friends, we actually talked about pregnancy symptoms for half the night and me planning their baby shower. It was on the drive home that I was feeling so emotional because the desire to have babies is strong in your late 20s and so is maintaining female friendships! Quite a few of my friends have recently had babies and have been super busy, hence why I made an effort to seek out women at a similar stage of their lives as me. I\u2019m not the type of person to make things about myself, which is why my reaction has even surprised and confused me! I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m feeling so weird about it. I\u2019ve normally been the type of person who is a high achiever and maybe its the fact that I still haven\u2019t had a baby at nearly 30 that\u2019s upsetting me.", "created_utc": 1667292337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj388d/aita_for_crying_about_my_friends_joint_pregnancy/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Other people and their lives don\u2019t revolve around you, and you shouldn\u2019t be having a pity party when things are going well for your friends. You know what will cause your friendship to fade? Making everything about you. You can feel however you want to feel about the situation, but crying and creating a scene and harboring resentment is what will kill your friendships.", "NTA for your feelings, as long as they\u2019re just your feelings. \n\nPutting this on them would make you the AH, though. Focus on the part of you that is happy for your friends.", "You should let your feelings be your feelings. You can't ever be an A H because of them; the question is: how do you show those feelings to others? Sometimes it's best not to just let it all hang out.\n\nI know your time is tight, but could you perhaps expand your list of friends to include a few other women who have no children and are not pregnant?\n\nAnd. Maybe a baby will come your way. Then your joy will be full. (And your time will become tighter!)\n\nYou haven't expressed your dismay to your friends, as far as I can tell from your post. So NTA.\n\nOne way or another, happiness will come to you if you put a little effort into it; you've already put some effort into it, so you know how it's done. I wish you success.", "There's no thought police here. You can feel whatever you like  it's how you act on those feelings which will determine whether you're the asshole or not. \n\nThe mods will probably delete this because of rule 7 but for now becuse of your *actions* so far you're NTA.", "YTA.  You've known them less than a year and are already possessive of their friendship, which is odd to me.  Friends can come and go in life, but you seem to feel like a few random women you met on Facebook are the only social connections available to you. Your reaction is strange to me.", "Gently letting you know YTA. Real friends celebrate for their friends\u2019 wins even if it brings up some jealousy. \n\nStrengthen your bond with them instead of being jealous of what they have. \n\nEdit: any chance you are pregnant too? Your response is a little emotional.", "Nta if you don\u2019t act on the feelings at all- we can\u2019t help how we feel. If you treat them differently or say anything about it then YWBTA", "NTA for your feelings however unreasonable they are because you are human and none of us are perfect and totally in control of our feelings.  You would be if you acted on your feelings and treat your friends differently because of them though.  \n\nIn your situation the best thing to do is work on being happy with yourself and process your feelings in a healthy way.  When you are really happy with yourself jealousy and insecurity doesn\u2019t bite as hard and you might find that your friendships are easier and closer as a nice bonus.", "YTA. Be happy for your friends and if you don't want them to exclude you then be involved. Be the cool \"Aunt who's not really an aunt but my mother's best friend\". Talk about baby stuff, go shopping with them, help plan the baby showers. Experience all of that with your friends and enjoy it. \n\nLike another commenter said, the only thing that will make your friendships fade is you being bitter and throwing yourself a pity party.", "NTA for how you're feeling, but you would be if you held it against them.\n\nWe can't always control how we feel in the moment. You can be happy for them and worried/sad for you all at once. Just don't treat them poorly for it, and don't let yourself get too in your head about it. \n\nJust be a good friend to them, hopefully they'll each do the same for you. It's okay to feel a little left out, but don't dwell on it. Instead focus on how excited they were to *include* you. They clearly both want you to be part of their lives, that's why they both shared their news with you.", "YTA\n\n\nYes, a true friend would be happy. You are only about you.", "Nah. You are not in the same situation as them. So of course you are the odd one out. But they didn't exclude you, unless they have been scheming together. But that sounds silly: let's both get pregnant and not tell OP!\n\nIt's normal to feel a bit anxious about new friendship.  And if you are TTC it's normal to feel a bit sad when others are pregnant. But you kinda remind me about myself years ago, constantly worrying if I fitted in, if people still liked me. Turns out: I have OCD. Not saying you have it but it's good to check yourself: am I worrying about nothing or is there any reason?", "YTA. Everyone gets upset sometimes over other peoples accomplishments. That\u2019s called jealousy. But it\u2019s not a good thing to have. You have to snap back real fast so that jealousy doesn\u2019t ruin something good. You have two wonderful friends that are having something amazing happening for them. You will get your time too and if they are good friends they will be just as excited for you as you are them. But don\u2019t ruin the friendship because of jealousy. If they are good friends then there is nothing to worry about. If they aren\u2019t including you in like movie sleepover night then that\u2019s something to get upset about. Not the pregnancy\u2019s.", "YTA. Take a look at your attachment type and style as I think it\u2019ll be an eye opener re how you navigate friendships", "NTA - You are entitled to feel what you feel. Emotions don\u2019t usually come in neat little single packets like ketchup, it\u2019s normal to feel both happy and sad at the same time. As long as you didn\u2019t break down sobbing and carrying on in front of them to ruin their good news it\u2019s fine. \n\nTalk to someone outside of this circle about your feelings, it can help to say things out loud sometimes. Maybe your husband can be a supportive sounding board to vent your disappointment at your friendships possibly changing. \n\nThen once you feel better focus on strengthening these friendships again. Get involved with planning showers and painting nurseries and other fun activities to help celebrate your friends little ones. Ultimately your friendships do change as your individual lives change but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t stay connected. \n\nOnce the babies are born maybe plan some play date luncheons once a month where your friends let the kiddos play while you ladies all catch up. When you get pregnant your little one can join the fun too and maybe one of them will be on their second pregnancy so there will be a nice mix of kids at these play luncheons eventually.", "What\u2019s rule 7?", "I would wager OP has trouble meeting or keeping friends *because* of this type of behavior. It\u2019s not cute in adolescence and it\u2019s even less desirable in a friend as an adult.", "Oh god! I don\u2019t know how I would handle the news of being pregnant myself. It\u2019s definitely not something I want to get myself into just because of FOMO"]}
