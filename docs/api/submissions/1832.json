They will just keep asking and asking, until they suck you dry or bring you down to their level.\n\nEdit: At this point they can't afford to be choosy. They (MIL too) should take any job that comes along. The 21 and 17 year-olds should also get jobs. Between the 4 of them, they can manage without your help. Stand firm.", "You can't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.  You just can't.\n\nMIL and FIL have had every opportunity to find jobs.  The 21 and 17 YO can also work.  This is not  your problem to solve, nor is it your wife's.\n\nNTA.  You have to tell your wife no.  And SHE has to tell them no.  It has to come from her.  You need to be in the room when she tells them.", "NTA - You've helped them for a very long time. But you cannot save them from themselves, at the expense of your home, and your marriage.", "NTA. They lack good decisionmaking skills and your money can be spent better than on tobacco, booze and weed. \n\nYou and your wife need to agree on a statement like \"We can't help you right now; we have no more money that we can provide to you.\" \n\nAnd be ready to call your local Children's Aid Society to bring your wife's siblings to a better place.", "NTA.  It's happened to me. Until you stop giving them money the calls and visits well never stop. I learned the hard way. Don't risk losing your own house.", "NTA I'll never understand people having kids they can't afford. I want three kids but understand this would be a huge financial strain on our salaries so we stopped at two. The kids are old enough for MIL to work too. You can't help people who won't help themselves", "NTA.  As others have said, you will get sucked dry.  Realisticly, you may have cash in savings, but your don't have money to lend.  You are moving in and there is ALWAYS at least 1-2 things that blow up and will do so on a Saturday and need repaired that day at great expense.  So plan on 2-3k of emergency expenses.  That is why mortgage companies want you to have 2 months of PITI in the bank.\n\nYour wife is in a bad jam, but you have to stand strong here or you will be under water inside 6 months.  Let her make you the bad guy, but she needs to understand that you have been poor and you have no intention of being poor again.  Why your inlaws let their severance end before even looking for a job and why you MIL refuses to work are serious barriers as well.  Its one thing to have your FIL lose his job because he had a stroke or some other disaster, but this seems entirely of their making.  Be strong, be ready for the shit storm that is new home ownership and keep you and your wife above the water line.", "NTA. do not give them money, and do not let them move in. they created this hellscape for themselves, they get to live in it. I feel sorry for the younger kids, they'll be in for one hell of a rude waking.", "NTA. It\u2019s not heartless to refuse to enable addicts. Set your boundaries and stay firm. If your wife wants to help them, let her spend her own money on them after the house bills are paid.", "Nta", "NTA. Don't throw your money away.", "NTA but your wife needs therapy right now.", "NTA.   You've given thousands to them over the years.   Get wife on board and stand your ground.   There's going to be lots of fallout from the family.   Try to avoid being drawn into the arguments.    No is the answer.   We can't afford it could be useful.", "NTA - you shouldn't feel guilty, you said it yourself that you've given them thousands of dollars in the past.  I think they don't want to be self-sufficient, or they would have done something before now.  I'm assuming that EI is similar to unemployment benefits in the US?  There's zero reason to wait until that is done to start looking for a job. \n\nI agree with other commenters that if you continue to give them money, they'll never stop asking.", "NTA. \nWhy have 5 kids if poor?  Why are the 21 and 17 year old not working part time and helping?  \n\nIf they can afford luxuries such as fast food, smokes, and weed, they don\u2019t need your financial help.  And that\u2019s exactly what I would tell them.  Well okay. I probably wouldn\u2019t say it to their faces but I would think it. \n\nI would not give them cash. You won\u2019t get it back. \n\nHowever- to keep the peace with your wife maybe buy them some groceries and that\u2019s it.", "NTA.  This money pit will never fill up, there will always be some other reason why they need money if you and your wife keep enabling them.  I would make cutting off all shared funds to them a requirement for your marriage to continue.  Moving them into your house would be an automatic dealbreaker for me, do not pass go, straight to the lawyer's office.  \n\nThat sounds harsh, but the other option is for this to continue the rest of their lives, probably to then be continued by her siblings.  Related, your wife is absolutely going to need therapy to end this cycle.", "NTA.  Between the FIL, MIL, 21 y.o. and 17 y.o., surely at least two of them could land jobs if they actually tried.  I feel bad that your wife is put in the middle, but she needs to realize that you are right to no longer want to enable their bad behavior.  Enough is enough.", "NTA Some people need to hit rock bottom before they made big changes. It\u2019s just a shame there are kids involved. Might be a good idea to do a little couples counseling do that this terrible situation and the pressure on your wife doesn\u2019t cause problems in your relationship.", "NTA. Die in this hill, OP.", "NTA.   Aren't trades still in demand . A plumber shouldn't  have a problem finding work", "INFO - You use the term lending/loaning a lot. Do they actually pay the money back?\n\nIf by loaning you mean \"giving\" then I'm absolutely on your side.\n\nIf they do actually pay it back (although admittedly this was presumably before the guy lost his job) then I'm unsure what makes this time different from the rest?\n\nI absolutely think you should be clear with you wife that they shouldn't live with you and that is a more than reasonable request. I also think you should consider agreeing to compromise and make this loan the last, and make that clear to them, rather than changing the \"rules\" out of nowhere.

If you give them money, you'll be doing it forever, in escalating amounts.  If you let them move in with you, they will stay forever.  What would your life be like?  I'm with you.

No one is going to stand on their own two feet if they're not forced to.  \n\nI understand why you are conflicted, but you're in a battle for your family (wife and children some day) with your wife's family.

You might want to consider seperating your finances though - have a joint account which you and your spouse contribute to and separate individual spending accounts. \n\nI doubt your wife is going to cut the cord so it's better to give her the autonomy to make her mistakes but not in a way that involves secrecy or endangering your new home.\n\nMake sure you are both on the same page about this and make sure you have a plan for if (when?) your inlaws move in \"temporarily\".", "NTA.

By helping them you are hurting them. They aren\u2019t just adults. They are adults with 2 grown children!!! They have never learned to manage money bc someone is always there to bail them out. I promise you if they paid their mortgage last month if the dad, mom and 21 yo kiddo go out and all get jobs working within a month they would have plenty of money to pay the mortgage.
