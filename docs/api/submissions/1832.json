AITA.\n\nEdit: Wow thanks everyone for the support and reassurance. This is something I've been having a very difficult time with. I hate to see people struggle as they do but like many of you have said, we have to stop giving them money now or it will never end. My wife and I have had a long hard conversation and both agree they are not moving into our new house with us and any money she gives them will come from her own funds and not our joint finances. My wife has an incredible heart and is very giving, I won't ever tell her what to do with her own money but setting up some rock solid boundaries for our joint funds is essential to us getting through this.

You're probably hurt and scared, and you feel betrayed, like your wife is the bad guy here for putting her foot down. You're stuck between a rock and a hard place. You love and respect your wife, but you don't want your family to be homeless. That's understandable. \n\nBut what you need to realize, right this very moment, is that it's not your wife forcing you to make this decision. Your wife has established boundaries for HERSELF. You would like her to forgo her boundaries to make your life easier. To give your family money wouldn't save them. You sacrificing money and your wife's self-respect WOULD NOT SAVE THEM. \n\nBut you know that. You know what they're like, you grew up with their bad habits, and it's only through grit and sacrifice that you and your wife have finally been able to benefit from the fruits of your labor. And that's how it should be. That YOU benefit from your own labor. \n\nYour parents made a decision long ago, subconsciously, that they do not want to do better, or be better. They are content to put their hands in the pockets of others to maintain a life for themselves and their other children. Eventually, you will have no money left to give them. And your wife WILL leave because you chose your parents and siblings over the one person who chose to do better with you and for you. \n\nIf you do this now, and give them money, it will never end. This needs to be the line that no one can cross. Neither you nor them. They will take from you all they can, without shame, because they OWN you. Remember that. As long as you fund them, you are merely an extension. An appendage meant to gather as much as you can for them to survive. \n\nCut yourself off from them. Realize right bloody now that THEY need YOU. YOU are a survivor, building yourself up to finally be safe, successful, happy, and in love. And as sure as your family are parasites, they will take all of that from you if they can. \n\nIt is hard. I know it's hard. But look at your wife, and realize that whenever your family takes from you, they're also taking from her, and any future you may have with her. Your wife loves you, and she wants to support your happiness, but she needs to be done now. You need to find some way to be okay with her decision, and not ask her to change. You fell in love with her for who she is, not for the puppet you think you need her to be to keep the peace.\"", "NTA\n\nIf they were just struggling it would be one thing.

Your wife needs to ask herself where it ends. And why they would stop relying on you when you always bail them out. \n\nIt's like dealing with a child.
