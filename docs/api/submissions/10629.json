Would've taken quit a while, I imagine.\n\nIt more often than not takes 2 people not paying attention for something like that to happen, it would be the nice thing to do sure, but he's under no obligation. I can't even imagine asking such a thing of a stranger, accidents happen.", "Then ESH.

Then there's some people that will check how much it was or buy a new plate themselves. Then there's people that will claim its shared responsibility and only pay halve. And then finally there are a few people who might pay more than the original plate was. Doesn't sound very profitable to me.", "So they spend cash on the nachos then get cash to replace the nachos that spilled.

Walking around with an open container of food is a recipe for disaster.", "So it was still his fault for daring to carry his lunch?", "Doesn't even say it was an open platter. Could have been one of those awful flimsy boxes you get in higher end joints (the ones that boast about not using sturdy plastic containers).\n\nIn any case, op wasn't watching and speed walked into him.

If there's an emergency, I can get to an ATM.  The situation OP was in, simultaneously being late and not having cash on hand, is absolutely a situation I could be in.\n\n(EDIT: And that's just on the \"had cash\" side of things.  I haven't seen it established that the accident was entirely OP's fault.

Still strikes me as a dick move. It's like flailing my arms then blaming you for getting hit. He admitted he was rushing.\n\nNever heard of this scam, but he could have offered to buy a replacement. Sounds an odd scam to me given no one really carries cash now everything is card based.\n\nIs this a non UK scam?", "Agree to disagree.

Most large institutions have bank to bank transfer support nowadays", "I\u2019ve only heard about it in a few US cities - I do get that but I feel like the situation does change it a bit.
