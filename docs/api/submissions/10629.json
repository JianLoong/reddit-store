The reasonable thing to do at that point would be to sit down nearby and eat those nachos, or at least stand off to the side. But no, he decided it was worth the risk to carry his open plate of loaded nachos down a very busy street, he did not pay attention to his surroundings and bumped into OP, and he dropped his food. That's still his responsibility, he had absolutely no justification for even asking OP to replace his food.\n\nAh worst, the bump was 50% OP's fault, which means she is not responsible for the other person's \"damages\".", "How is this OP's fault, they weren't the ones carrying nachos in the middle of a busy street. People bump into each other. If he wanted to eat his loaded nachos, he should have been standing off to the side of pedestrian traffic, sitting at a table, bench, or the curb.\n\nEven if this wasn't a scam (which it definitely was), it's still 100% the other dudes responsibility to hold onto his food and pay attention to his surroundings. If I were eating street food (I'd never eat loaded nachos while walking, wtf) while walking, and I bumped into someone and dropped my food, that's on me. Now if I were off to the side, standing out of pedestrian traffic, and someone came out of nowhere and pushed me, knocking the food out of my hands, that would be a different story, but that's not what happened here.", "How did she cause the accident? He bumped into her just as much as she bumped into him. It's not like he was standing off to the side and she tackled him. Even assuming that he wasn't a scammer (which he definitely was) he's the one that brought an open plate of loaded nachos onto a busy street and then didn't pay attention to his surroundings. He's the only person responsible for those nachos, not OP.", "What was OP's mistake? The other guy was clearly not paying attention to where he was going either. Absolute worst case scenario this is a 50/50 fault case, in which case, OP still isn't obligated to replace his food. He's the one that took the risk of eating loaded nachos while walking down a busy street, it's his responsibility to not drop it.\n\nIf he were standing off to the side, sitting on a curb, or otherwise out of pedestrian traffic and OP went out of her way to bump into him and knock the food out of his hands, then sure, she should pay for it, but that's not at all what happened here.\n\nAlso, this was 100% a scam, I bet those nachos weren't even real, and were dropped 100+ times that day trying to get people to pay for it.", "The other guy was eating and not paying attention, if he didn't want his food to end up on the ground, he should have paid attention to his surroundings and held onto his food better. He's way more at fault for \"distracted walking\" than OP for \"quickly walking\"."]}
