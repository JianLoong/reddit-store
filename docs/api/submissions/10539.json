It is fine to say you want to re-look at family budgets.\n\nYou mentioned you work part-time because you are studying. Is this so that you can eventually earn more and contribute more evenly? If so I would expect him to be keen to support you with this as it is a sacrifice of income for the good of your longer term shared goals as a family.\n\nDoes your income leave you with anything leftover after childcare? You absolutely do need some money for yourself, even if that's just for the freedom to replace clothes, buy toiletries etc as and when you need them, rather than checking with him first.\n\nYou've mentioned his income is largely due to investments his parents have made for him. Does he have an income from work besides this? What portion of the 200k is that? I'm wondering whether he sees the money from his parents' investments as being a gift for him rather than being his income per se, and therefore maybe that's where part of his reluctance to share comes from. I'm not sure what the answer is to that one, but it's worth thinking about.\n\nLastly, you mentioned your husband wants to be the provider. That's fine if that's the arrangement that you're both comfortable with, but it doesn't sound like you yourself are. Either way, it should not come at the cost of having some disposable income each.

If he simply denied her the money she asked for then he\u2019d be NTA but who the hell speaks to their spouse like that?", "exactly i mean its not like he is out spending on himself and not allowing her to do the same..", "You don't think him calling her an ungrateful bitch is AH territory?", "here is her comment\n\n[\u2013]sleepdepmom[S] [score hidden] 19 minutes ago \nthis is where i think i messed up. we both agreed to not spend any extra money on ourselves as we wanted to put as much money in as possible without any debts. occasionally he will give me money for fun but it\u2019s been a good while. the only thing i see him spend on himself is getting a haircut", "read the comments..she commented they made an agreement", "Read her comments, she wasn't the primary caregiver. His/her mom was childcare until they moved away. And now shes paying for other childcare. So what if she did more chores. He's literally paying all of their living expenses. The dude ain't keeping any money for his own fun either.", "And she could get a full time job.", "Yes but I think she said it was a temporary rule for the period of time during the house being built that he is paying 100% for", "I overlooked that comment and he is an AH for using those words, but OP made is sounds in her initial post like he was financially abusing her, and that definitely does not seem to be the case here. \n\nLooks like OP pick up a few extra hours and get some spending money for herself.", "So it\u2019s not unusual for him to give her fun money? Thanks for that proof.", "They made an agreement, and asking to renegotiate the agreement isn't breaking the agreement.  Aggressively calling his partner names for annoying him was super fucked up though.", "she definitely could, and should, imo. if she\u2019d like extra money the best way is to earn it herself. literally all i\u2019m saying is that his reaction was disproportionate.", "and he is allowed to spend money on haircuts, but all of her money has to go to childcare? hmmm", "do u read? she said its been awhile..because he is paying for a new home and paying the rent on their current home.", "It's not the same. He's paying for everything. If her money is used only for childcare, then why work?", "You apparently can\u2019t read. Are you the husband?", "idk maybe because she wants to? not everyone wants to be a SAHP lol", "[deleted]"]}
