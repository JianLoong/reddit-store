It's just upon her refusal to refer to me as 'your father' to my son that I have started to call her by the name that he authorities in her country accepted. \n\nHowever, she has a group of friends from high school in her country who referred to her as 'Authorised name' at high school as she couldn't use her real name. They still call her by this name to this day, and she does nothing to correct that even though she no longer lives in that country.\n\nI'm not sure it's racist as there is no discrimination in anyway, she lives in our flat and can do as she pleases (apart from calling me 'First name' to my son!).", "NTA. While she's the AH for everything else\u2014it sounds like she refuses to use what you want out of spite if she's saying maman for your wife\u2014using a name she was forced to hide behind on her passport seems like a crossed line. i don't know anything about the kurdish/turkish thing, but if you wanted to do tit for tat, i'd say to pick a random name like laura instead of that.", "I disagree that it\u2019s always the AH move. When I was 10 I had a camp counselor whose first name was Lisa Jane. She gave a little speech at the beginning of the summer saying that her name is Lisa Jane and we can call her that or LJ, but not just Lisa or just Jane. Fine. No problem. For some reason, partway through the summer, she decided it would be amusing to call me by a variation on my first name, a variation I didn\u2019t like. I asked her several times to stop it, but she wouldn\u2019t. So, when she called me by the variation, I started responding by calling her Lisa. It took 2 times, maybe 3 for her to get the message and go back to using my real name. I consider my method both successful and reasonable and my evaluation wouldn\u2019t change if I had been 25 instead of 10. Sometimes, some people don\u2019t quite get it until the unpleasant behavior is turned back on them.", "> blimey\n\nJust sayin', I've seen crazier stuff on Reddit.

Tit for tat all the way lol", "Except it's not your name. It's an honorific that doesn't apply to her. This is like telling people to call you Dr versus Sir. Are you technically correct? Sure. But it's not going to make anyone respect you more.", "Right, you mentioned that in the post. WHY does she insist on this, though? I understand what she\u2019s doing but not why.

She probably lets people call her that name bc that\u2019s what they know her as, but the only reason it exists is because of racism.

It's her sister so she needs to handle it.", "I agree with you that I am being petty, and to some level, it may be pathetic.\n\nIn normal times, I respect everything about her and her identity, yet that respect is not reciprocated. I have politely asked on numerous occasions for her to refer to me as 'your dad' to my son and in a last ditch effort, I refer to her in front of him in a name she does not wish to go by.\n\nThe name that she does not wish to go by is also used by Kurdish women in Turkey. Therefore, any name that I chose to call her by that is not the name her parents gave her would also be 'supressing' her Kurdish identity.", "Wait! Unless I called her by another Kurdish name that wasn't hers that she also dislikes/despises. My man, woman, person - You did it! You got me there!"]}
