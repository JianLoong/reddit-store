I think her refusal to say \u201cyour dad\u201d or something along those lines to your baby is weird and I think it\u2019s reasonable to ask her to do it and for her to actually do it. \n\nFor the record though, it\u2019s not the end of the world for your kid to know your name.

You probably will have it at some point anyways, but this will make it happen earlier.\n\nYour child will know you\u2019re their dad and SIL won\u2019t change that.  I personally think it\u2019s fine for you to call her that while the kid\u2019s this young, but as your kid gets older it\u2019s going to get more and more dicey.

In school, a teacher might ask the kid to take a note home to \"your dad/mom\"; the teacher almost certainly wouldn't ask the kid to take the note to \"OP's First Name/OP's Wife's First Name\", and wouldn't be using an honorific that doesn't apply to him or her, but referring to the kid's parent(s) by their relationship to the kid.

I think you've got great insight and can empower people.", "Make her leave the next time she does it because she is not respecting you as your sons father", "This added context is SO important. I agree with your comment wholeheartedly.", "Right, but why is it soooo important for SIL not to teach his son he should call him Dad, when she teaches him to call Mum, Mum? \n\nUntil she can give sensible, respectful answer she doesn't deserve to be respected.", "Especially since she is allowed to stay in their house. NTA op", "Can you kick her out for being disrespectful?", "Yup, upon reflection and with the help of this sub, I've seen the error of my ways. \n\nWhilst it is annoying and disrespectful for her not to refer to me as 'your dad' in front of my kid, I shouldn't use the name she was authorised to take instead of the name she goes by", "Again, if this is so important for her, she can explain why refusing to refer teach his son to call him Dad. Or she can go where her name is respected", "I say NTA\n\nIsn\u2019t she practising culture erasure by not using  a form of daddy? \n\nI think there are very few cultures that refers to parents with their first name and given that this particular culture they live in usually people naturally say dad/mum she can deal with hearing her legal name. \n\nUnless there is trauma nobody is aware of which is why she is not using a form of daddy she can just deal with it. It\u2019s literally not a big deal to say your dad. \n\nOP can stop when she does. Also, kids should reinforce the identity of their caregiver and pretty soon kid will start referring to OP by his name naturally for a while, it\u2019s cute when that happens not when it\u2019s forced by Aunt. Maybe OP can just use a different made up silly name for her if he doesn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings\u2026", "Good or bad reason, she needs to tell OP and his wife, at the same time, what is.", "I've not often seen tattoos of internal organs, aside from the heart and brain.", "Does SiL think you're not doing enough so not deserving the title of Father? This could be passive aggressive.", "What op is totally glossing over is that Turkey literally outlawed the use of Kurdish names and sent armed military forces into villages with Kurdish populations to annul kids' names and replace them with Turkish equivalents. Turkey has banned individuals from entering because they have Kurdish names including q, w, or x (letters that don't exist in the Turkish alphabet). The reason sil can't use her actual name and her passport says differently is due to a coordinated campaign to eradicate the existence of her culture and people and op's son is also half Kurd. It's not just racism but far more insidious. Outlawing Kurdish names is a specific attempt at eradicating the entire  group . It's horrific that op just doesn't give af. I", "Time to sit her and your wife down, together, to find out WTH her reasoning is. Because there has to be *some* reason as to why your wife is excusing this. If she wants her sister to live with you, she needs to be on your side.", "Great opportunity to get creative with an offensive nickname. If there\u2019s one thing I know about Brits it\u2019s that you\u2019ll have no trouble coming up with a cracker.", "Remind her you allowed her to stay in your home and you are not obligated to. NTA imo. But do what someone else suggested and talk to your wife and as a united front sit your SIL down and tell her the rules.", "It\u2019s ridiculous to equate that to the active suppression of the Kurdish culture by a state (well, multiple states).", "So you mean it's a Turkish \"equivalent\" name that was imposed on women with Kurdish names declared \"illegal\" or constitutionally suspect by Turkey. That's not a name \"used\" by these women ffs. It's a product of continued and egregious human rights violations and attempts to commit ethnocide against a particular ethnic minority within its borders. You rounded pathetic several notches ago.  Are you serious ?  You are literally equating pettiness to a recognized human rights violation. What is wrong with you? \n\nYou would be the Christian German kid during the ride of nazism in Germany that thought it was funny to laugh at a Jewish classmate for not wearing their yellow star and reporting them to the teacher / authorities because they cut you in line on the playground. Do you not see how fucked up what you're doing is? How you are teaching your half Kurdish child something despicable? Seriously do you give a shit about the kid? Or his mom? Or their people / culture ? Because this is beyond despicable.", "As I said earlier, after giving it some thought, I see why calling her the authorised name is wrong. It should have occurred to me before, but sometimes in the heat of the moment, we don't always act true to ourselves. \n\nFor pettiness sakes, I will find a Kurdish name that she dislikes and refer to her as that instead of using a name that she had to accept.", "SIL needs to explain her reasons for disrespecting his wishes, 1st. She brought a knife to a gun fight that she started. She's no victim, here.", "Yes supporting ethnocide is somehow an appropriate response to pettiness especially when the child you apparently care about is literally half Kurdish themselves.", "You might be from a different planet so let me explain. Here on Earth, when other people are referring to your parents while talking to you they say 'your mum' and 'your dad'. This is commonplace across all sorts of different cultures, ethnicities and languages all over the world. \n\nMaybe in outer space, where you're from, they do things differently, but here on Earth that's how it goes."]}
