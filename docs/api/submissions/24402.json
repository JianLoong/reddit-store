Last night she came to ask me again, I said \u201csorry, kinda busy\u201d.

If someone does not give me a destination where they want to get off my car and then navigates me around town AND complains about my driving i\u2019m definitely not giving them another ride.", "NTA, if she's that complicated to drive around best for her to take a bus", "Her cagey nature alone would prevent me from ever offering again, the unnecessary critique of your driving is just a bonus.

NTA, but avoiding the conversation isn't going to help you in the long run.", "NTA.", "Why do I feel like I have read this before, or at least some of the comments?", "There is something off about her. Trust your instincts. Drop her at the bus and travel in a group setting. NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not their free UBER.", "NAH. She just said you're driving too fast, and it was obviously because it was hard for her to give you directions while you were driving, doesn't make her an AH. If you don't want to give her a lift again, I don't think that makes you an AH either.\n\nHowever, now that you know that her giving you directions while driving isn't going to work out, you could just tell her you can drop her off at the same place as last time, or some other place you already know the way to. But you're not obliged to give people rides of course.", "Her fear is completely understandable.  She doesn't want you to know where she lives or near where she lives because while you MIGHT be an OK guy, she doesn't know you well enough to bet her safety or her life on it.  Women can't afford to just assume that a guy isn't going to attack them in some way, especially since self-proclaimed \"nice guys\" are some of the worst.  \n\nYou don't have to give her a ride if you don't want to, but try to put yourself in her shoes and consider the choices she has to make before you get upset that she didn't trust you out of hand.  \n\nIt's after a full day of work; she's already tired.  Her choice at the time was a 20 minute walk in the dark, alone, down a rural road that led to a bus stop where anyone could be waiting, or a ride with a co-worker she doesn't know very well, but at least he's familiar.  No brainer...  Until he starts asking her where she lives.  \n\nYeah, he needs that information but does she really want a guy that she doesn't know that well knowing where she lives exactly?  Women are told all the time that for their own safety, they shouldn't give their direct address to drivers or people they don't know well.  What if you're a stalker.  ([https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/05/07/she-ordered-uber-what-she-got-was-stalker/kgOFXxzng3yxTgWw2Df0dJ/story.html](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/05/07/she-ordered-uber-what-she-got-was-stalker/kgOFXxzng3yxTgWw2Df0dJ/story.html))\n\nThen he wants to know an intersection to drop her off at, but he might be able to figure out where she lives from there, so she has to find a different bus stop that's close enough to home but far enough away that she feels safe without him knowing exactly where she lives...  Except he's getting tense and now the whole atmosphere is tense and she is really uncomfortable, so she talks about how fast he's driving.  \n\nBut, he got her where she needed to go safely, so she asks again because now she is more prepared with her safety.  \n\nAs a woman, I completely get it.  \n\nNAH.  She's doing the right thing prioritizing her safety over your comfort. Her actions tell me that she's probably dealt with a stalker or abuser. \n\nBut you don't have to give her a ride again either.  Maybe talk to her about why YOU aren't comfortable anymore if you care enough to clear the air.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm guessing this is shift work at a factory considering the time of day and people needing rides to a bus stop.  If she's working on the line, by the time she gets off work, she's exhausted.  Anyone's first instinct is going to be \"A ride?  Yes please!\"  Once she's in the car and he's asking questions, that's where the fear kicks in.  Now, she's realized she doesn't know him all that well or what he's like.  Hence the caginess."]}
