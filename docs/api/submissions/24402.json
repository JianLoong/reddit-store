She just said you're driving too fast, and it was obviously because it was hard for her to give you directions while you were driving, doesn't make her an AH. If you don't want to give her a lift again, I don't think that makes you an AH either.\n\nHowever, now that you know that her giving you directions while driving isn't going to work out, you could just tell her you can drop her off at the same place as last time, or some other place you already know the way to. But you're not obliged to give people rides of course.", "Her fear is completely understandable.  She doesn't want you to know where she lives or near where she lives because while you MIGHT be an OK guy, she doesn't know you well enough to bet her safety or her life on it.

Her choice at the time was a 20 minute walk in the dark, alone, down a rural road that led to a bus stop where anyone could be waiting, or a ride with a co-worker she doesn't know very well, but at least he's familiar.  No brainer...  Until he starts asking her where she lives.\n\nYeah, he needs that information but does she really want a guy that she doesn't know that well knowing where she lives exactly?  Women are told all the time that for their own safety, they shouldn't give their direct address to drivers or people they don't know well.  What if you're a stalker.  ([https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/05/07/she-ordered-uber-what-she-got-was-stalker/kgOFXxzng3yxTgWw2Df0dJ/story.html](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/05/07/she-ordered-uber-what-she-got-was-stalker/kgOFXxzng3yxTgWw2Df0dJ/story.html))\n\nThen he wants to know an intersection to drop her off at, but he might be able to figure out where she lives from there, so she has to find a different bus stop that's close enough to home but far enough away that she feels safe without him knowing exactly where she lives...  Except he's getting tense and now the whole atmosphere is tense and she is really uncomfortable, so she talks about how fast he's driving.\n\nBut, he got her where she needed to go safely, so she asks again because now she is more prepared with her safety.\n\nAs a woman, I completely get it.\n\nNAH.  She's doing the right thing prioritizing her safety over your comfort. Her actions tell me that she's probably dealt with a stalker or abuser.\n\nBut you don't have to give her a ride again either.  Maybe talk to her about why YOU aren't comfortable anymore if you care enough to clear the air.  \n\n\nETA -- LOL  Reddit out there proving my point.    \nMe: *Explains why a woman might not want to give a man she doesn't know well her address.*  \n\nMultiple men -- \"No you're wrong how dare you let me tell you how you are wrong and downvote you.

We organized a work Christmas party one year and we had all agreed to go to a place nearby the office for ease of getting there for everyone because some of us were staying until the end of the day. It seemed the fair thing to do. Well one of the ladies who got off early convinced everyone to go to another location saying I just wanted to be close to my house because I had to take the bus home. I said to her well you just want to go to this place because it's around the corner from YOUR house and you actually have a car. Whatever we ended up going to the other end of the city to where this woman wanted to go. The girl driving us was already one of those girls who just CAN'T follow directions to save her life. She had them written down to her but she tossed them out I guess. So I tried telling her the most straightforward way to get there. She decided to try and follow the directions from memory that she threw away. A twenty minute drive took 3 frustrating hours. She kept turning around, blocking traffic, cutting people off and just getting us lost over and over. I NEVER took another ride that girl ever again.
