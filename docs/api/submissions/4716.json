Often times when I go out to eat, I will save about half my meal so I can have an easy lunch or dinner the following day. This past weekend we went to a new restaurant and were each excited to try what the place had to offer, so when my friend asked if he could try some of my meal, I willingly obliged. He then proceeded to eat the majority of what was left on my plate which was almost half of the entire meal.\n\nWhen the check came, I asked him to contribute some money to my meal since he had eaten such a large portion of it and made it so there was no longer enough to make a meal out of it. He claimed that since we had always agreed to pay for what we *ordered*, he shouldn't have to pay extra since he wasn't the one that *ordered* the meal and I had willingly let him try it. I then explained that I had expected him to take a bite or two, not eat a meal's worth of food on top of eating his own entire meal. He claimed I should have specified that he could only have a bite or two if that was all I was willing to share.\n\nI understand that we had an agreement to pay for what we ordered, but I think it's kind of a dick move to eat what was essentially an entire meal of someone else's and then expect them to pay for it. So, what do you think, Reddit? AITA?\n\n**Edit:** Since this has already come up a few times - I wasn't paying attention to how much he was eating off my plate. At this point, he had already finished his entire meal so I didn't expect him to have enough room to eat another half a meal. On the flip side, he knows that I often split my meals to take home the extra for the next day - and even admitted as much during the conversation about the bill. I also ended up paying for everything I ordered.\n\n**Edit #2:** It should be noted that **he admitted to knowing that I intended on bringing leftovers home for later,** and that was why he didn't polish it off completely. I had already asked for a to-go box for the food by the time he asked to try it and we were simply waiting on the box and the bill.", "created_utc": 1671038236, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlwlxs/aita_for_asking_a_friend_to_split_the_cost_of_a/", "score": 880, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
