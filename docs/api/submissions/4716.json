Often times when I go out to eat, I will save about half my meal so I can have an easy lunch or dinner the following day. This past weekend we went to a new restaurant and were each excited to try what the place had to offer, so when my friend asked if he could try some of my meal, I willingly obliged. He then proceeded to eat the majority of what was left on my plate which was almost half of the entire meal.\n\nWhen the check came, I asked him to contribute some money to my meal since he had eaten such a large portion of it and made it so there was no longer enough to make a meal out of it. He claimed that since we had always agreed to pay for what we *ordered*, he shouldn't have to pay extra since he wasn't the one that *ordered* the meal and I had willingly let him try it. I then explained that I had expected him to take a bite or two, not eat a meal's worth of food on top of eating his own entire meal. He claimed I should have specified that he could only have a bite or two if that was all I was willing to share.\n\nI understand that we had an agreement to pay for what we ordered, but I think it's kind of a dick move to eat what was essentially an entire meal of someone else's and then expect them to pay for it. So, what do you think, Reddit? AITA?\n\n**Edit:** Since this has already come up a few times - I wasn't paying attention to how much he was eating off my plate. At this point, he had already finished his entire meal so I didn't expect him to have enough room to eat another half a meal. On the flip side, he knows that I often split my meals to take home the extra for the next day - and even admitted as much during the conversation about the bill. I also ended up paying for everything I ordered.\n\n**Edit #2:** It should be noted that **he admitted to knowing that I intended on bringing leftovers home for later,** and that was why he didn't polish it off completely. I had already asked for a to-go box for the food by the time he asked to try it and we were simply waiting on the box and the bill.", "created_utc": 1671038236, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlwlxs/aita_for_asking_a_friend_to_split_the_cost_of_a/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You now know where you stand with them.", "Don't blame you one bit.", "It doesn't sound like he admitted he knew you were taking that specific food home, it sounds like he admitted he knew you often did that, these are not the same thing.\n\n>Swapped plates to avoid spilling\n\nDid your friend know this was the reason or were you making an assumption? It seems you make a lot of assumptions about etiquette. I would still say it's up to you to retrieve your food and not leave it in front of your friend if you don't want them to keep eating.", "See at the end of the day, there is people that can\u2019t afford to feed their families and rely on food banks etc. count yourself very fortunate that you can still afford to eat out. It\u2019s not the end of the world that he\u2019s ate half your plate \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This!!! Do this OP and I think he\u2019ll get why he was such a jerk.", "Are we related?  LOL\n\nOP - please do this. And then give us an update.", "This is the PERFECT solution!\n\nOP is NTA, but restaurant buddy is the big time AH. The guy can't have it both ways. He can't say that he shouldn't have to pay for a meal he KNEW OP wanted to take home.", "Yessssss!! Brilliant plan.", "The reason we had such an agreement was that he loves ordering huge expensive meals, while I prefer getting something modest and stretching it out over two meals. He also makes more than I do and can afford to do such things, while I only get to eat out every once in a while and therefore like to make it stretch.", "I do consider myself very grateful and blessed that I can afford such luxuries because that hasn't always been the case. I never claimed it was the end of the world and certainly don't see it as such.", "Your friend is the AH.", "Admitted he knew you were going to take home the specific food in question, or admitted that he knew you do that sometimes. Because previously you've indicated he just knew it was a habit you partake in, not that you were taking the specific food, that you gave him permission to eat, home to make a second meal.\n\nRegardless, putting your whole plate of food in front of your friend doesn't make sense to simply avoid spilling. Like, you can put a portion on your friends plate. Putting a plate of food in front of someone implies an expectation the person will eat it.", "So you told your friend in advance that you wanted to save your meal for the next day and he maliciously ate all of it on purpose. Why are you here then, that would obviously make him the AH. He owes you dinner next time. Keeping my judgement considering you keep going between \"he should've known this\" vs. \"I explicitly told him\". Also sketchy you waited for the bill to say anything. Stop sharing your food, problem solved.", "I had explicitly told him at previous dinners that this is how I usually do things, I'll be honest that I don't know that I had explicitly stated at this particular dinner. I didn't wait until the check came intentionally, that was when I became aware of how much he had actually eaten. The flip flop is because, yes - he should have known before he ate so much of the meal - but he did not confirm he knew until after the check came and I asked him to pitch in.", "> he admitted he knew I wanted to take it home to have later and that's supposedly why he didn't finish it on me\n\nAhhhhhhhhh I see, this definitely changes my assessment, and he's much, much more TA if that's the case."]}
