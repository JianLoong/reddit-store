{"id": 4716, "submission_id": "zlwlxs", "title": "AITA for asking a friend to split the cost of a meal he ate a significant portion of?", "selftext": "My friend and I went to dinner over the weekend, but still have not settled this issue - so we decided to take to Reddit to see what you all think.\n\nUsually when we go out together, we each only pay for what we order - that way if someone wants a more expensive dinner or to have a few drinks, the other person isn't stuck footing their bill. Often times when I go out to eat, I will save about half my meal so I can have an easy lunch or dinner the following day. This past weekend we went to a new restaurant and were each excited to try what the place had to offer, so when my friend asked if he could try some of my meal, I willingly obliged. He then proceeded to eat the majority of what was left on my plate which was almost half of the entire meal.\n\nWhen the check came, I asked him to contribute some money to my meal since he had eaten such a large portion of it and made it so there was no longer enough to make a meal out of it. He claimed that since we had always agreed to pay for what we *ordered*, he shouldn't have to pay extra since he wasn't the one that *ordered* the meal and I had willingly let him try it. I then explained that I had expected him to take a bite or two, not eat a meal's worth of food on top of eating his own entire meal. He claimed I should have specified that he could only have a bite or two if that was all I was willing to share.\n\nI understand that we had an agreement to pay for what we ordered, but I think it's kind of a dick move to eat what was essentially an entire meal of someone else's and then expect them to pay for it. So, what do you think, Reddit? AITA?\n\n**Edit:** Since this has already come up a few times - I wasn't paying attention to how much he was eating off my plate. At this point, he had already finished his entire meal so I didn't expect him to have enough room to eat another half a meal. On the flip side, he knows that I often split my meals to take home the extra for the next day - and even admitted as much during the conversation about the bill. I also ended up paying for everything I ordered.", "created_utc": 1671038236, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlwlxs/aita_for_asking_a_friend_to_split_the_cost_of_a/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't see anyway someone can eat half my food while we're both sitting there and not notice.  \n\nOnly two reasonable options is if ate the food super fast and took huge bites or you left the table.  \n\nOther than that after 30 secs I'll say give me my plate back \n\n\nNAH", "YTA, you should've stopped him after a bite or two and ask to pay up if he wants to finish the meal. You didn't, so you can't expect him to pay", "yta - but mildly so. If you expect your friend to pay for the food they eat off your plate, you tell them that before they start snacking. If you didn't tell your friend you were saving the food, they probably ate more than they normally would so less of the food is wasted.\n\nLet me be clear, you're not the asshole for expecting your friend to pay their fair share, **you're the asshole for not making that expectation clear BEFORE you let them eat your food**. Him knowing you **often** do something is not the same as being informed and **knowing** you are saving the food. It isn't your friend's duty to keep your habits with food at the front of their mind any time you eat together.\n\n**\\*EDIT\\* Changing answer to a HARD YTA because OP swapped plates with his buddy. Sorry, but you plop food in front of someone, it's very reasonable to assume you're fine with them eating said food.**", "ESH. When someone agrees to let you try some of their food, you take a bite or too unless offered more. But I also think that making a big deal about it and making him pay is a bit much and if you left it on the plate maybe he assumed you weren\u2019t gonna finish.

You just let him eat the food without warning him you would expect payment. At its core the problem is him paying for your food was not the deal you all had when you say down so it's unfair to change up the rules after dinner. You could have told him if you keep eating my food you're going to have to kick in.", "Soft YTA. It is not unreasonable to think that your friend would only take a bite or two. However, you did not say anything to him and admitted that you weren't paying attention, so it is not a nice gesture to ask him to pay for half of your meal because he might have thought that you were ok with him eating the rest of the food. Also, let it go, it is just a meal, next time tell him that he can only have a bite or he will have to pay for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Were you staring at the ceiling the entire time? How do you sit across from someone eating your food and not look at them at all?

Mainly because you were right there", "You were the one who gave him half a plate to chow down on...", "There was clearly a miscommunication here between the friends. I think that makes the friend who ate a lot of her food a jerk, but I don't think it means that she's entitled for him to pay for the food that he ate that she told him he could eat...\n\nHonestly with a friendship where they go into details this much about paying for food, the friendship seems like more effort than it's worth.

He wouldn't have eaten so much if you had paid any attention to the thing you were trying to save, or communicated about it at all.

I was trying to be as objective as possible, but it's tough.\n\nYes, he admitted he knew I wanted to take it home to have later and that's supposedly why he didn't finish it on me."]}
