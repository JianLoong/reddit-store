No matter how wonderful your sibling is, having a 3rd person is disruptive.", "NTA. You have empathy for your sibling and love them. They should recognize that, but also recognize that you have a plan to have kids and live your life with your partner and having a room mate would hamper that significantly. It adds a dynamic where the two of you would not be able to be yourselves and enjoy each other at any time and any place as you should have the right to do, as adults in your own home. Emergencies may be another thing but signing up for a roommate long term is a serious cramp of lifestyle.", "NTA\n\nYou need time as a couple. And before the kids come. \n\nIf they are earning 6-figure they should be able to afford their own place or a place with roommates. \n\nAnd it was cheeky of them to suggest paying below market rent. I assume you guys have a mortgage? \n\nNTA. Nothing for you to feel guilty about. Sibling is being a cheapskate.
