Since years,  I'd have the \"hardware\" and matching coffee beans to make coffee in at least 6 to 8 ways at home (starting from Bialetti stovetop coffee maker to coffee drippers, French press, aeropress... you get the idea). \nLately, I started to use a la pavoni portafilter machine with a hand lever, which takes time to get used to and sometimes the espresso tastes bitter.\nWhen my parents in law visited us a few months ago, they asked for crema coffee, I tried to adjust the espresso like my BIL told me to (experience from his standard portafilter machine), they took a sip and stopped drinking but didn't say anything. After lots of questions they finally admitted the coffee tastes bitter, so I made a new one that was much better (I secretly tasted to be sure) and offered all the other possibilities for coffee we had (filter, aeropress, stovetop...) but they refused all other options. \nFor context: My in laws usually drink regular black crema coffee from a fully automatic coffee machine, which is ok, but imho there is room for improvement (e.g. adjusting the settings of their machine etc), but I never dared to mention anything or even complain as they wouldn't take it well. Most of the time I'm not even allowed to use it on my own. \nFor further context: When we were on holidays together and shared a  house, they had no problem with using the filter machine there and made fun of me because I brought my small Bialetti stovetop and some nice espresso beans.\n \nSince this visit, my MIL never fails to mention, how awful this cup of coffee was, that I should get a better coffee machine, how well her (BIL)  son knows to handle his machine,  what a great cappuccino they make (they refused any milk when visiting us and usually never have milk in their coffee) - all comments I use to ignore with a smile. \n\nBut for their next visit they told us that they plan to bring their capsule coffee maker to our place to \"get some nice coffee in the morning\". At that point I snapped,  telling her that there is absolutely no need for this given the multiple possibilities for different types of coffee, naming all of them and saying that I feel this is pretty disrespectful,  judging from one cup she didn't like and not even tasting anything else. Now, MIL is affronted because I spoke up and my husband is mad at me because I ruined the mood for their visit by \"being rude and showing off\" and \"not taking criticism well\".\n\nAITA here?\n\nEDIT: I see, I overreacted and should choose \"my battles\" more wisely. Thanks for reminding me!\n\nRegarding the showing off thing: I know this can be very annoying, so usually I never talk a lot about this hobby unless someone is really interested or asks questions. To my in laws I offered espresso or filter coffee. During the time I was struggling with the new machine there was always the option of having a decent (stovetop) espresso, which they declined.", "created_utc": 1691053016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gyoy1/aita_for_snapping_at_mil_because_she_brings_her/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Taste is a subjective thing. Specially, coffee is an acquired taste.

They know what they like, and you aren't being a good host by not providing it for them.\n\nFor their part, you screwed up once and they won't let it go or try anything else you make.

If they want to bring their own damn coffee machine just let them.  Its not exactly a big deal and certainly not a hill on which to die.", "YTA like others have said, taste is subjective and it really comes off as rude and disrespectful to think that just because you know more about coffee than them, that they are somehow beneath you for not appreciating the complex types of coffee and assuming you know what\u2019s best for them. Especially trying to force more of your coffee on them after they\u2019ve already made it clear that they prefer to use their own.

You're coming across as an insufferable coffee snob, and she sounds like a dog who won't give up her bone, repeatedly telling the story of one lousy cup of coffee.

So, let them bring their own machine! Sounds sensible to me.", "ESH your mil for being so rude about something you enjoy, and you for being so dramatic about them bringing their coffee maker. Let them bring it if it makes them happy, it's not a big deal.", "lol, You guys are dealing with some real existential problems over there. \n\nLet them bring their own stupid machine if that makes them happy.   The lengths some people would go to prove a point is absolutely mind boggling. \n\nNTA", "I get where you\u2019re coming from. This is clearly something you deeply care about feel very strongly about. But you need to remember, their criticism of your coffee is not a reflection on you as a person!

I'm kinda a coffee nerd too so I know for a fact that **a lot** of people don't like good coffee. Like certain alcohols, people would rather drown it in syrup and some people enjoy a barrel aged bourbon neat. Weird that she kept pestering you about it. \n\nStill, something that should've been laughed off.
