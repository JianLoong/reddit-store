You'd be better off calling CPS, this kid needs help and it's not the kids fault.", "You would not be the AH, but you should try calling CPS first. Sounds like he needs a welfare check first", "NTA but I think Child Protective Services is probably more appropriate. It sounds like the child may not be neurotypical and/or has an issue that is not being properly addressed.", "NTA, I agree with a potential CPS phone call. My parents had a neighbor like this. Their son is low functioning autistic and he would run the neighborhood naked screaming bloody murder and the parents just let it happen because \"it was all just too much\". Cops had to be involved a couple times before they got their son in check.", "NTA. The real life version of Donnie from the wild thronberrys needs mega help. Like welfare check, CPS report level help.", "NTA.  If it takes a village, then it requires the villagers call CPS so nobody marches to the house with pitchforks.  Kid needs help.  Parents clearly don\u2019t care.  Kid is endangering himself and others.  Willful blindness is never right when children are at risk.", "Document, get a Ring and put up surveillance cameras and record. The parents need to be held accountable and pay for damages, and your parents lives have unjustly been turned into a living hell.", "NTA but calling the cops is not the way. Call CPS. This doesn't sound like it's just some disobedient kid (and even if it were this behavior throws up MASSIVE red flags), this seems to be a kid with a severe disability that isn't getting the care he needs for one reason or another. Someone definitely needs to get someone around to check on that situation and CPS is far better equipped to do that. At best cops would just be a needless step before CPS is contacted.", "NTA. Until you call the police on a 5 year old. He\u2019s 5. What are they going to do?  Cuff and book him?\nCall the police on the parents.  \nOr consult an attorney and have a cease and desist letter sent. \nOr call CPS and send them videos of his behavior. \nThe problem isn\u2019t the kid in most situations. It\u2019s the parents.", "YWBTA if you DIDN\u2019T!", "YTA for getting the cops involved with a kid that clearly needs professional help. Find the right sources to get involved, but not the cops.

Because he is a minor, his parents are liable. Determine the cost of the property damage and tell his parents to cough up the replacement cost.

This kid clearly has a developmental delay and these usually come with behavioural disorders, especially if there is a severe language delay.
