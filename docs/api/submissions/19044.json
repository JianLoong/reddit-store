We\u2019ve been very happy together every since. We got married at 28 when she was pregnant with our daughter. I work full time in a very high stress but lucrative field. My wife stays home to take care of our little girl and the household. We are both 33. \n\nLately we have been fighting a lot, mostly about her \u201cworkload\u201d. I\u2019ve tried to be understanding, I now leave work 30 minutes early every day to pick up our daughter from school. A few weeks ago my wife really went off and kept ranting about hiring a cleaning lady so she wasn\u2019t always so stressed. Red flags started going off in my head but I kept my concerns to myself. Our house is only 2700sqft  and it\u2019s only the 3 humans and 2 dogs. Not exactly a huge load responsibility wise. I figured she\u2019d cool off and calm down in a few days. Nope. She started demanding I let her know what wage I\u2019d be willing to pay! She wants to put out ads! I told her I\u2019d take care of it. Instead I grabbed my assistant at work and sat him at my laptop for the week with the password to my home security. She\u2019s averaging around two hours of activity a day. \n\n7am : Wake up and get our daughter ready for the bus \n8:15 : Back to bed, dogs left unwalked and unfed \n11:10 - 2pm : Wake up again, let the dogs out back for nowhere near long enough, throw food in the bowls for them. Order breakfast and coffee, text message me about the ridiculous amount of dishes breakfast for her and my daughter created ( a single bowl and a single spoon in reality). Lounge around and watch TV and scroll on her phone. \n\n2-3:30 : Very minimalistic cleaning, mostly things that are glaringly obvious. Texts me while doing so vastly inflating the difficulty level and level of actual dirt. \n\n3:30 - I pull in after picking up my daughter. \n\nThis was all of last week and most of the week before. I confronted her on Friday. Told her I wouldn\u2019t be hiring anyone and that she really needs to pull it together, she\u2019s contributing almost nothing and is complaining and lying about the little she does do. That obviously didn\u2019t go over well. She lost the plot and just continues to lie about her work load. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\nEdit : I left out some information that is clearly rather important. \n\nWe have a laundry service, she doesn\u2019t do laundry. We subscribe to a meal delivery plan, the only cooking done at home is on Sunday and I do it. Most if not all shopping is done by myself or my assistant. \n\nShe spends at a maximum of 2 1/2 hours alone with our daughter daily. She has multiple hobbies and interests that she pursues and receives a generous stipend weekly to spend how she wishes. Both of our dogs are hers, I have a parrot I care for with occasional help from my assistant.", "created_utc": 1685978104, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141hrsl/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_truth/", "score": 9271, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Absolutely ridiculous and immoral behavior. \n\nInstead of immediately dismissing and then spying on your wife, did you ever consider having some empathy and concern? If her responsibilities are really so minimal, why is she stressing out? Untreated PPD? Depression? Burnout? Give an actual damn about your wife. \n\nAlso, 2700 sq ft is almost 3 times the size of my house. I\u2019d never get done keeping it clean for 3 people. And dogs only need fed once per day, so your manufactured outrage is silly. Edit to clarify that I assumed there was food in the bowl leftover and she was adding new. Vet recommends feeding your dog every 12 hours but some larger breeds only need 1x per day.

It\u2019s awful to hear that your wife is neglecting the dogs, she\u2019s an ass for that. I think you went overboard and crossed a huge boundary with your wife (and your poor assistant - that\u2019s not cool or ethical). What you did was way out of line and controlling. I doubt she consented to anyone using the cameras installed in your house for this purpose. I understand that stress can affect our judgement and lead to bad decisions. You do have a right to be frustrated here. However, I\u2019d consider leaving a partner if I knew they did this. \n\nShe could be depressed, it sounds like a possibility. She could also be lazy. I don\u2019t know her so I won\u2019t assume. I really think in this situation couples therapy (and perhaps individual therapy as well) could be very helpful for both of you. \n\nPersonally, I think you should apologize and for your dog\u2019s sake hire a walker. They can be very inexpensive especially if you use apps like wag or rover.", "I will go for YTA solely for the fact that you let a coworker spy on her without her consent. Yes, her lying while doing nothing is an AH move, but what you did was so much worse that I can't even pay attention to what your wife did. \n\nWas she always like this or did something happen and her behavior changed?

Sounds like a crappy relationship, tbh.", "ESH\n\nYou suck for spying on your wife.\n\nYour wife sucks for not fairly contributing to your household.

If I was her, and your daughter is in school (pre-school?? she's 4-5?) I would honestly rather go work anywhere than have to clean my house up after other demanding people, and then use that money to pay the cleaner.

Plus the fact that she communicated something to you and you just thought if you ignored her then it would stop\u2026", "ESH. The monitoring is weird, but your wife clearly needs help. She sounds depressed, as someone with depression. She stays in bed, doesn\u2019t care for the animals, eats late, and feels overwhelmed. She needs help, not a cleaning person.", "ESH. Having said that, your wife may have some issues that need attention from a professional.", "Clearest case of ESH I think I\u2019ve seen on this sub.

She's an ass for over selling how much she's actually doing, and expecting to stay home and have a cleaner as well.", "ESH - It's pretty apparent that your wife is depressed and probably bored out of her mind. I live in a a 3000sq ft house with 3 other people and 1 cat. The house doesn't get too messy if you keep up on it but how many times can you mindlessly do preventative cleaning until it feels like you're not accomplishing anything? You essentially turned your home into her work place and now she has no escape from her \"job\". Ive seen this with many SAH parents who's kids age into school and even WFH people that are literally burnt out from being in their own home. As you clearly make enough money to pay your employee to do essentially nothing for an entire week, you should look into couples counseling and a maid.

I\u2019m sorry - ONLY 2700 SQ FT?", "YTA. \n\nYou snooped and spied because you distrust your wife. She was honest enough with you in saying she was overwhelmed and stressed.\n\nBeing home alone all the time with no social life can really put a damper on motivation and energy.

OPs wife may have be lonely with depression and an inner shame for not being able to do the smallest tasks creating a cycle of guilt, feeling overwhelmed but still apathetic to what needs to get done.\n\nShe is not a gloried housekeeper. She is a human who deserves empathy and understanding even if you see it as being \u201clazy and dishonest\u201d. Her truth may be that she is stressed and overwhelmed, that threshold for stress is much lower when you\u2019re depressed.

She sounds depressed.\n\nOne of the hardest things about being the stay at home person, for me at least, is that nothing I do is seen. However, everything I don\u2019t do is noticed.\n\nYour paycheck alone is validation of a job well done that someone else notices and cares enough about to pay you. I suspect there are also other little things along the way recognizing the work you do at the office. \n\nYour wife likely has none of that. Maybe she\u2019d like to go back to work? Back to school?

But now your child is in school, your wife could reasonably contribute more to the household (although still split fairly with you).\n\nHowever you are WAY more the asshole here.

How long has this been an issue? Is she being \"lazy\" or is she burnt the hell out? That's why I didn't go e s h. Sounds to me like she's telling you something is wrong and you're not listening. It's speculation obviously but this one seems more likely to me based on how you generally speak about your wife. Not seeing a whole lot of \"like\" there, and absolutely no trust.\n\nAnd if it truly is her just not feeling like it, then y'all might need to have a conversation about the roles you see each other playing in this marriage. But that conversation does not include surveilling your spouse like this.", "YTA. Seems to me that your wife is going through some emotional problem, depression perhaps.

She might have cut back but still be acting as if she hasn\u2019t because she wants to get her point across AND get some rest.\n\nIt sounds like y\u2019all both needs some help.

Instea,d  it is coming after she asks for help. \nYTA OP even if your wife was suddenly a lazy slob because instead of talking to her when you saw \"red flags,\" you decided to video survail her in her own house. Sure, if she is lying, that is bad, but just think how awful it is to be unknowingly survailled by some stranger when you think you are in the privacy of your own home. For example, she could be walking around naked because she thought she was alone and not being watched.", "You had your assistant spy on your wife all day?!

If it was just about dicking off all day while you work, she'd be playing video games or shopping or whatever activities she likes, not just wasting away in bed. Depression can make small tasks feel impossible and can make even the lightest responsibilities feel like you can barely keep up, and two dogs and three kids is not a light responsibility. And this sounds like depression. \n\nMaybe it's best to approach this situation with empathy, hire her the cleaner for a bit but help her attend some therapy possibly together or get her to a physician. Treat it as a problem to solve together, not a struggle against each other. Because if she is struggling as I suspect, even if you're not in the wrong for being upset, it's not gonna get better out of guilt. It's easy to be 'right', it's harder to actually solve the problem that put you each on different sides of a conflict. \n\nAnd I would also suggest not to do the spying and especially not bring an employee into that.

And if you're trying to ask a question of \"when should I suffer for the sake of my partner\" it doesn't give anybody a good guideline.  Some people can suffer a lot for the sake of someone else and doing that in an unbounded way leads to resentment.  Like, ok I should be giving 100% to the relationship.  But what if I want to go for a hike while my wife wants me to stay home and clean the basement?  If I'm supposed to be giving 100% all the time, does that mean I should do everything I can for the sake of my partner if doing otherwise wouldn't kill me?  What if it would just burn me out?  How long would it take to burn me out if I worked that hard?  How much can I give to the relationship, putting the needs of the relationship over my own wants and needs, before I burn out and have no joy left in my life?  And how close to that line should I be required to get at all times to be considered to be a good partner?\n\nClearly we're not literally giving 100%.  It's not healthy to always prioritize your partner over yourself.  People are supposed to take that to mean \"We're both trying to do right by our partner, which sometimes means making sacrifices for the good of the unit.\"  And everyone's idea of what \"sometimes\" means is different.  And when you're supposed to be giving 100%, but you mean sometimes, then when somebody says \"why aren't you giving more?\" the temptation is there, not to say \"I didn't want to\" but \"I can't\".  I'm not giving more because I can't possibly give more.  You're unreasonable for asking me to do more.  If I were to do more, something bad would happen and you're unreasonable for asking me to do more.  I'm clearly doing everything I can.  And how could anyone argue with you?  No one knows how much you can or can not do.\n\nSo in a relationship where anybody has tendencies either towards learned helplessness or towards people pleasing, it can lead to a vicious cycle where one person takes on as much as they possibly can, and the other believes that taking on more would be impossible, and the more their partner carries for them, the harder it is for them to believe they can do anything.\n\nThings in a relationship don't need to always be equal.  When things go wrong, somebody carries the other for a bit.  But a relationship needs to be built upon an understanding that you both intend to put in equal effort, even if you don't get equal results.  And maybe one person's effort is going into the home and the children and the job and the other person's effort is going into *healing.*  So that when things aren't going wrong anymore, when things are normal, you can both give as much effort as you both agree is fair, to bring you both towards shared goals.", "I have fibromyalgia (and depression to go with it) and a lot of the depression is about how fucking destroyed my body feels after doing basic shit.

Is she loosing sense of self due to spending most of her free time either focusing on household responsibilities or due to emotional burnout? You mention her going to bed. Is she in bed a lot? Is she more tired lately? Is she not finding enjoyment in things that used to bring her happiness?

Do you feel the stress you endure at work is more draining than her duties while she's working from home? Do you feel resentful when money is spent that you suffered to make?\n\nInstead of making this a you vs her event, try to find the root of both of your strong emotions. Is she dealing with mental health concerns like depression and/or childcare burnout? Are you misdirecting resentment about work concerns toward your wife? \n\nI think this argument may just be the perfect confluence of built up frustration about multiple different things.

She doesn\u2019t need extra help, she needs to start actually doing stuff around the house. What\u2019s seen as laziness can be a symptom to another problem, but it\u2019s her responsibility to get that figured out and make OP\u2019s life easier. If she is depressed, it\u2019s on her to get help. But depression is not an excuse to lie to your husband, neglect animals, and claim you\u2019re overwhelmed and demand outside help when you already do fucking nothing.

We have a cleaning lady who comes once a week, once every two weeks when he isn't here (medical or work reasons). Without her, our floors wouldn't ever be totally clean, and that's WITHOUT two dogs and a prepubescent child, who add additional messes. I don't know HOW my mom did it when I was a kid, being the only SAHP to our late dog and me (my dad used to work an hour and a half away from home, and would leave before I woke up at 7am and come home WELL after I went to sleep at 8-9pm), or why she continued to tolerate his weaponized incompetence; when she came to be with me at college for a few months, we came home to the house as if it was in a hoarding situation because the man just doesn't see messes or dirt/dust. He left food all over the place, crumbs and food crushed and tracked all over the floors, the floors (like the ENTIRE floor, not just one little area) of the kitchen were sticky somehow??????, broken glass in all of the corners which he never bothered to check for or sweep, and all that was with our cleaning lady coming once a week.

Someone who sleeps that much is not healthy, and that is a HUGE house which one person cannot be expected to maintain, even with 1.5 hours a day of cleaning with no distractions (impossible with two dogs and a kid that young, who, as I said, add a lot of messes as well). Our cleaning lady nowadays comes with her now-adult daughter, and TOGETHER they take about 5 hours to do the inside of our house (and that's not even deep cleaning either, except for seasonal garage and window cleaning twice a year, and we have a separate landscaper to handle the outside - leaf blowing, lawn, etc.) \n\nMy dad never saw all the work my mom did to keep our house liveable; it's clear that OP is similar, given everything he's said here.

I also found it very off-putting when OP describes her work load as \"all she has to do is take care of 3 humans, blah blah blah!\"  Like taking care of 3 humans and 2 dogs is just SO easy.", "I see a number of options: 1) everything OP wrote is correct and SAHM is lazy; 2) everything OP wrote is correct and SAHM is bored, going crazy away from adults all day, etc - basically SAHM needs another role in life; 3) everything OP wrote is correct and SAHM is depressed or suffering from a psychological/emotional disorder; 4) OP is not telling the truth and we have no way to gauge what is going on.  Maybe OP could suggest some family counseling, coaching it in terms that are not accusatory - he feels as though they are in a rut, getting older, he wants to revitalize their marriage, etc. #1, 2, and 3 will not be solved by going in guns blazing. Here's hoping #4 is not true and they can salvage their marriage and family.", "Agree. It sounds like something is wrong, but nothing explains or excuses lying about it.", "It's conceivable that she hates being a SAHM, maybe doesn't even know it.   \n\n\nI am a slob, I admit it freely, and while I technically love the idea of being home and doing lots of projects etc etc in reality? It's not just the financial reality of me needing an income that would keep me at some kind of structured job where I leave the house. I have a cleaner who comes in fortnightly, and that? Makes me pick up ready for her and wipe things from time to time. She keeps the grossness at bay and stops me getting overwhelmed by the mess my laziness has created.I do more if I have to leave home and do some work than if I am at home puttering. Maybe this lady is the same.", "It just\u2026there\u2019s a private school and a laundry service and a *meal* service (except one day a week when OP cooks to create dishes for the wife to complain about even though it turned out there weren\u2019t even those?) but a house cleaner is a bridge too far and so now we have this whole line-\u2018em-up-and-knock-\u2018em-down of how she wants everything and does nothing and\u2026yeah, I do feel like this has been a scenario or even an entire person who has been invented especially to make me dislike women.", "Cause it\u2019s a woman.

Even if she was acting entitled or privileged, with a good income healthy human brains desire interaction and excercise. \nI\u2019m going to assume you, th hisband, is just trying to gain understanding the only way you know how. \nI recommend personal and couples therapy for  your wife and you to come together to find out how you may better support her moving forward.", "After reading this I can\u2019t make a judgment call on anything except ..

Honestly really hard to see past that to anything that the wife is or isn't doing. The assistant was watching her *in bed*. What if she had decided to masturbate in the \"privacy\" of her own home?

Also because time, for me at least, seems to flow a little different. I look forward to sleeping and dread being awake, next thing you know it's next week. Another cue would be how she is constantly on her phone. She's probably looking at all of the insta-perfect houses without a single cord in sight and feels the pressure. It happens so often they call it house dysmorphia. I actually think that maybe  she may think she needs a cleaner but really needs someone to re-organize or declutter her space. That might be a good compromise because it's not a weekly thing and may get her out her slump and free up some mental space.", "And that could be, as well.", "This would be me (minus the lying). I'm currently a SAHM with my 7 month old but am going back to work 2 days a week once he's 10 months old.

It is a godsend and I appreciate the gesture.", "Best decision I ever made was to find a cleaning lady to come in every two weeks after we bought our previous house.  No kids living with us, had half an acre and both worked full time.  I'd rather spend my spare time gardening and preserving food that cleaning carpets.

I had been an entitled asshole all my life.  It hurt like hell (but I was insightful enough to know he could not help me with that part) and it was really *really* hard to face my own BS but I also knew it must have been very difficult and painful for *him.*  I got into therapy, accepted a diagnosis (I had 3 to choose from!), started eating right, exercising, quit smoking/pain meds and over the course of 18 months totally changed my life - at 47. \n\nWe had 5.5 really really good years together (we even got to joke about the \"before\" and \"after\" me) before he passed away suddenly last year.
