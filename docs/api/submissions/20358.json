She's giving you a CHILD, at the sacrifice of her body image and physical comfort.

If your boss was ringing you at home to cry about something would you take the calls every day?\n\nIf it was a bloke ringing you every day would you answer, or tell him to grow some back bone and get in there and work it out for himself?   \n\n\nYour wife shouldn\u2019t be mistrusting you, but you aren\u2019t exactly building trust with your open calls with this pretty young 24yr old. Your wife is telling you \u201cI feel undesirable\u201d and you are ignoring her feelings and then PLOUGHING ON With the \u2018safe\u2019 friendship with someone needy.   \n\n\nSort yourself out mate. Stop being a door mat to the girl at work. Set her straight \u201clook you\u2019ve been here a couple of weeks now, you should be able to answer these sorts of things for yourself.

Honestly, if she needs that level of hand-holding, she may not be the right fit for the job.  If you really believe that her questions are genuine, then you should be letting your superiors know about her inability to complete basic tasks independently.  She may need additional training, or she may need someone else to be assigned to help her when you are out.  Or this job just might not be the right fit for her.  But someone who has the necessary skills for a job and has been at a job for several weeks should be able to make it though most workdays without requiring assistance so urgently that she has to call someone.  Let alone 3 times in a single day.  \n\nSo are her questions genuine and she's just completely incompetent?  Then you need to make someone aware of that.  Or are her questions a cover because she likes interacting with you, likes attention from you, and you are more than happy to oblige?  Then you need to set boundaries fast, because it is not a good sign that it's already impacting your marriage after only a few weeks.  \n\nMy advice would be to introduce her to another coworker she can go to for questions.  Direct her to this coworker whenever you are out and occasionally when you are in as well so that she gets the message.  Stop taking her calls entirely.", "YTA and this work relationship is starting to veer into unprofessional.  If she has work related questions that\u2019s one issue.

Your answering in front of your wife in spite of her talking to you about how it makes her feel is a red flag for wife.\n\nsometimes?

You need to tell her to stop calling you at home.", "Yta -  your wife is right , there\u2019s other people at your job that can help her.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t you explained to her that you\u2019re not on call for her when you\u2019re at home .\n\nI think you\u2019re enjoying  having a little damsel in distress constant wanting your attention .\n \nBecause calling you and crying about someone being mean to her at work is the type of thing girls do with their boyfriend.\n\nAre you her boyfriend ??\n\n\nI feel bad for your wife .", "YTA. You don\u2019t mention being her Supervisor, so I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not.

This co-worker knows exactly what she's doing just the same as you. While you are busy getting your \"ego stroke\" on by white-knighting for a young (and by no means as timid as you think) damsel, you are putting your marriage and family life in complete jeopardy.

Grow up.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Yta and it\u2019s not even \u201csoft\u201d as others have said. Your wife is going through pregnancy and all she\u2019s asking of you is to not pick up calls from some dumb bimbos. Jesus stop taking the fucken calls. She\u2019s a grown ass woman. She needs to learn to communicate and not rely on one person her entire life.", "Normally,  these \"partner is mad I have contact with other people of the gender(s) I'm attracted to\" are ridiculous stories about partner's that get jealous of anyone else existing near their partner. This time, however,  it seems pretty obvious that your wife has reason to he upset.  You're answering after hours phone calls from a coworker you felt the need to describe as pretty while your wife is pregnant and insecure.  Yet you just dismiss her feelings and tell her you enjoy helping a beautiful girl. Is getting your \"ego\" stroked worth stressing out your wife? YTA", "YTA cmon man you can\u2019t be that blind can you? It\u2019s making your pregnant wife uncomfortable and she is already having insecurities because of her pregnancy. Are you a manager? Do you have to answer every call? I\u2019m sure there are people she can ask at work if she needs help. Also do you not need to be certified in welding? I\u2019m sure she isn\u2019t clueless. You can help her at work but there isn\u2019t a reason to be answering her outside of work hours. Seems like you like the attention even if it hurts your wife", "YTA. Aside from the uncomfortable way you described this coworker (young, pretty, timid, needy) and the implications therein - unless it is part of your job description to take calls after work hours, there's no reason to continue to do so, especially if it is distressing to your wife. \n\nSure, everyone likes feeling useful and smart and helpful. But you're putting yourself and your wife and this coworker in a potentially regrettable situation. Presumably, your coworker got this job without you holding her hand, so she should be competent to do it. If she finds herself feeling uncertain, she needs to have the confidence to either figure it out herself or ask...whomever is at work at that time. It's not a coincidence that she came to rely solely on you. And it's probably not because you're so incredibly nice and she's so incredibly timid. Sorry. But that sounds unlikely. \n\n24 years old, while relatively young, is still a full grown adult and she is unlikely to be as naive and meek as she is portraying herself to be. I mean, does she know you have a pregnant wife at home? Does she know her calls are making your wife uncomfortable? If so, then I'd put some very clear boundaries with her before you get yourself into serious trouble. And if not, maybe you should ask yourself why that is. I personally can't imagine making frequent calls to a male coworker, after work hours, for any reason...let alone to cry about our other coworkers...let alone if I knew it was making his wife uncomfortable. That would feel incredibly inappropriate. And I find it hard to believe that either of you are entirely oblivious to how looks, regardless of the intentions.", "YTA- You are also being taken advantage of by this coworker.", "Yta what baffles me is that this is a welder asking question about a job she needed to go to school for and get paid good money to do a good job I think she\u2019s manipulating this whole situation to get to you", "YTA \n\nYou need to leave the work at the workplace. Your home is not yours alone. You are married with a baby on the way and you should be available for your wife, not some co-worker who is calling you at home. She has other resources available when you're off duty.", "YTA. Work should stay at work. Your wife is clearly feeling neglected. Somehow I doubt it's a \"happy marriage\" from her end.", "I was kinda with you for a bit, though how you described her was weird. But then you said how you enjoyed it and she called you 3 times in one day! One was crying about someone being mean. If she is really gonna make it at that job, she cant be calling someone three times in one day. That really isnt acceptable anywhere.\n\nSorry YTA and this should stop. You are being creepy.", "Light YTA. Work life balance is IMPORTANT. Work should stay at work. You are letting your work interrupt the time you get at home with your wife and that\u2019s not fair to her. Regardless of whether it\u2019s a woman or man or elephant. Your wife deserves to not have her time with you interrupted for things that can wait or be addressed by someone else.", "YTA.\n\n'Hey OP I tried calling but no answer?'\n\n'Soz relentless single chick - was busy with my preggo wife - any issues we can pick up at work tomorrow. Good luck!'\n\nBoundaries. Its not that hard OP. But peoples true intentions always become clear when 1. They react poorly to them or 2. They don't use them at all.", "YTA And I call bs\nI can't imagine that a woman in a male dominated industry (mostly...I do know female welders so I'm going by what they say) that had to go through quite a lot of training to get certified is calling you basically crying and not knowing how to do her job. Either you're making this up. Or this girl is so obsessed with you she's willing to put all of her hard work to the side just to hold your hand which I just don't believe. Yeah I'm not thinking this is real but if it is yta", "YTA. You also admitted that this stroked your ego. FYI, she also doesn\u2019t sound THAT timid if she called you THREE times.", "Yta: I\u2019ll even take out the wife and say it\u2019s inappropriate work behavior alone.

Your workplace. \n\nLet's assume for instance that your new coworker doesn't have any I'll intent and is genuinely calling your for support at work. Is your workplace that toxic that you are the only one she can rely on to be level headed when answering her questions and concerns? I assume welding is a predominantly male field and for a young female to start work there might expose some misogyny. Seems like your workplace is to blame a lot of not being accommodating to new hires. Is there really no other coworker that helps out the new hire with questions. Are they not welcoming and helpful? What makes you the only one she can turn to for help. \n\nNow onto the popular opinion. Do you really feel like you have an appropriate coworker relationship. She called you 3 times, not just for work related things but for moral support. How has your relationship developed so fast that she's willing to talk about your co-workers with you?", "This woman is definitely interested in you... It's really innapropiate for her to call you just to cry on the phone because, oh, someone said something mean to her :(. You should be caring for your wife's wellbeing but instead you are helping this woman just because she doesn't know how to do her job? And she needs to call you more than once when you are home, with your pregnant wife, who's suffering from insecurities, and you think this unprofessional relationship is fine...", "YTA. She should not be calling you outside of work hours. It\u2019s very inappropriate.", "YTA. Your wife has every right to not trust you with the way you\u2019re letting some \u201cpretty and timid\u201d colleague call you after working hours. Leave work at work and focus on your family when you get home. The 24 year old is not a child and it\u2019s creepy the way you describe her so it sounds like she is. And you are a grown ass man who participated in growing a human being but is now busy having his ego stroked by someone not in his marriage.

Your pregnant wife deserves way better and I hope she eventually sees that.", "Hard YTA. No wonder your wife is insecure.", "So many people here won\u2019t understand the work dynamic of a plant and why she could be so timid and looking for a (non creepy) mentor.  The percentage of female welders in plants are very low. It is still very much a male dominated trade and they let you know that constantly and a lot of times not nicely. This goes for almost every plant I\u2019ve graced in the southern states. \n\nWhile she may actually be looking to you because you feel \u201csafe\u201d she still needs to learn what\u2019s appropriate and not. Calling you crying is not something a coworker would normally do over immature office banter.  Also she\u2019s a welder, I assume if she\u2019s in the plants she went to school and became certified. I assume she would of also taken a test to get the job as most companies require a show of skill. She passed and was hired. She\u2019s proficient at her job.

You will not always be there to hold her hand when things go south.\n\nConvince her to show some bravery and learn from multiple people, using her best judgement to tell if they're messing with her or not. She will learn faster and have better quality learning if she gets three explanations and finds the common thread.\n\nStill show her things sometimes, but also start building distance.
