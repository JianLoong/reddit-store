We're going to a wedding in November. She only really remembers we're going when we talk about it. Sometimes she brings it up. If she wasn't going, she wouldn't talk about it at all.

And of course, wedding was around nap time.   You know that cute little ring bearer in his tuxedo?  Yep.  He did not do his part.  He was tired and cranky.  No way was he walking down the aisle in front of all those people.  Your brother is probably just thinking of how cute his kids will be all dressed up.  But they are toddlers.  This event will not be fun for them.  It will not be fun for mom and dad.  It will not be fun for those in the area of said tired, cranky toddlers who are not family and came to enjoy themselves.  Let your brother know this.  The kids are young.  They are not going to remember anything about your wedding if they do come or if they don\u2019t.  But everyone else will.

And I'll see you when we are home, \" \nBut on the inside..... we actually enjoy that for one day. We can have that glass of wine, enjoy adult talks without diverting our attention to kids all the time, or spend half of the event chasing after kids to make sure they behave. \nIn other words, catch up with everyone else and have an evening to relax and just be adults for a second.

No, but there's merit to both sides. If this marriage works out in the long run then I predict both you and your brother regretting this.
