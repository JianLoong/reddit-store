Not everybody wants kids in their wedding party. I didn't; we also had a child-free wedding. My own brother was saying stuff like if we were inviting my partner's nephews, then my own nieces and nephews should be invited. I irritably told him we were having NO kids at the wedding. Some people think their kids should be front row centre at everything!", "So I actually worked in the wedding industry years ago prior to switching careers and those costs just add up. I\u2019ve dealt with the craziest dynamics of in laws and bridezillas. It\u2019s nice of you to do this. I probably would too but I\u2019m also meticulous and type A so I analyze all of the what ifs and it just wasn\u2019t in the cards for me let alone my fianc\u00e9 who is very mellow and just doesn\u2019t want it to be a big thing. \n\nI genuinely just think my brother is being selfish and by not reaching out to me to squash the nonsense since I still have not even planned anything just shows he\u2019s really the toddler in this situation. It does upset me and I know of many wedding incidents where family doesn\u2019t speak. I would hate for that to be the case because I don\u2019t think I did anything to warrant this behavior. I also didn\u2019t mention but he has thrown sly comments about how my fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t a good fit for me or judgey statements about why he isn\u2019t proposing prior to the engagement and that I shouldn\u2019t tolerate it. I have never and will never feel the need to defend my relationship but with him acting out now it just makes it worse in my opinion.", "Nah, he IS an entitled child...", "Isn\u2019t it funny how when people have kids they suddenly completely forget the trauma of their own wedding dramas and believe their kids need to be in the headline of every event??? Like hello I\u2019m not doing this wedding and spending thousands of hard earned dollars so that you 3 year old can scream before I walk down the isle and get her sticky fingers all over everything? Is it that much to ask for a drama free day that revolves around just us ?", "I even politely said to his wife like hey can you just grab the phone for a second away from the kids when I told them that it wasn\u2019t an option. I didn\u2019t want them to hear and didn\u2019t want to lie and brush it off for another time.", "Honestly we\u2019re trying to get a car and a house first. Hopefully in a year the BS will have died down. We are also doing city hall regardless to buy the house so the question will be do we still want to ceremony and reception down the line or are we just happy as is and move forward. I really just wanted to have that day for us but not if people get nasty. At the end of it we\u2019re already married so do we want to spend extra funds on a day of our dreams or travel to New Zealand for an epic honeymoons haha. Not worth it to argue with my fianc\u00e9 over dumb shit that isn\u2019t a priority for us. Rather invest in us.", "He is, just like my mom, having the expectation to your wedding. I feel the same. It\u2019s your wedding and make sure it\u2019s what you want and if your brother wants to be upset, let him. It\u2019s not his day", "well lets hope for you your brother doesnt just show up with kids in tow to the wedding becuase he might do that", "I think just as an added precaution I may add a statement on the invite. Something along the lines of \u201cwhile we love to watch children run and play, this is an adult only kind of day.\u201d Or not give the option of plus 3 and 4 just state the number based on who is named on the invite. That way it\u2019s clear.", "i like the while we love to watch the children run and play this is an adult only event.  \n\nthe only other compromise i can suggest and i seen it at other weddings is the couple hire on site babysitting service so the adults can drop of children and attend the event but then again your brother doesnt sound reasonable when it comes to his kids lol", "NTA. \n\nI have a 3 year old. We're going to a wedding in November. She only really remembers we're going when we talk about it. Sometimes she brings it up. If she wasn't going, she wouldn't talk about it at all. If it isn't to do with her, in some way,.she isn't interested. That's pretty much how 3 year old work. They're self centered little things.\n\nAnd it's your wedding. You and your partner. Not your brother's. Not your nieces.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Good for you for standing firm on your boundaries. I hope you have a lovely relaxed day!", "Your brother has chosen a ridiculous hill to die on. I don\u2019t blame you for not reaching out to him. He is the one being silly. NTA.", "NTA,\nHow dare your brother tell your niece to provoke a negative reaction from her. Parental manipulation. \nHe needs to respect your deduction to keep it small, intimate and child free. \nIf your niece was so quick to cry you know she wouldn\u2019t be behaved at your wedding\u2026 to further confirm  you are making the correct choice. If your brother doesn\u2019t attend the wedding cool, that\u2019s his decision and he\u2019s basing it on his hot emotions at the time and he will regret not being there to share great memories", "lol, the niece is 3. Like she even knows or cares about being in the wedding. \n\nThis is 100 percent on the brother. Why, oh why, does he have his knickers in a bunch over this? No clue. \n\nNTA. Brother is behaving more like a toddler than the toddler. If I was his wife - we\u2019d be having a long hard talk about his behavior. He\u2019s being ridiculous.\n\nWhat is it about weddings that makes people lose their damn minds??", "NTA. As a parent... Not everything has to be kid friendly.", "NTA, it's your wedding and you get to choose the specifics of it. Childfree weddings are a lot more common these days and are definitely what I'd go for if I got married again. \n\nYour brother is being an entitled ass", "ESH. I think people who exclude very close family members from their wedding only because of their age are AH. \n\nThe brother shouldn't make all this drama though nevertheless and shouldn't have put his mother between both of her children. He should have just acknowledged the no children rule and then either accept the invitation and go without his children or say he won't come and that is it. All this badgering to change OP's mind was stupid.", "NTA\u2026my son was once a ring bearer in a wedding.  Yes the kids look cute, but dang, that was a tiring and not a fun day for me.  And of course, wedding was around nap time.   You know that cute little ring bearer in his tuxedo?  Yep.  He did not do his part.  He was tired and cranky.  No way was he walking down the aisle in front of all those people.  Your brother is probably just thinking of how cute his kids will be all dressed up.  But they are toddlers.  This event will not be fun for them.  It will not be fun for mom and dad.  It will not be fun for those in the area of said tired, cranky toddlers who are not family and came to enjoy themselves.  Let your brother know this.  The kids are young.  They are not going to remember anything about your wedding if they do come or if they don\u2019t.  But everyone else will.  Also, remind your brother of his wedding.  Ask him why he was allowed to have boundaries and you helped with them, but you are not allowed the same consideration for your own wedding?  Maybe you could incorporate the kids by having a brunch the next day and letting them help open your gifts.", "NTA", "I doubt the kids even know what is going on.", "Girl put your foot down, it\u2019s YOUR (and your partner\u2019s) day.

That explains the 0-60 time of \"flat out\" where you threatened to do a courthouse wedding.  You've similar insanity and knew to shut it down right out of the gate.", "His daughter is 3, the odds that she even understands the situation are slim. If she did cry, it's because her dad went out of his way to cause her to.", "To be honest. \nSome of us parents actually enjoy child free events. Of course, we will tell the kids \"awww I'm sorry, honey. But this is adult only. But mommy/daddy will miss you a lot. And I'll see you when we are home, \" \nBut on the inside..... we actually enjoy that for one day. We can have that glass of wine, enjoy adult talks without diverting our attention to kids all the time, or spend half of the event chasing after kids to make sure they behave. \nIn other words, catch up with everyone else and have an evening to relax and just be adults for a second. Before we go back to being parents. \n\nIt's just some that believe, \"omg how can you say that! You must live and breathe for the kids!\" And completely Leave behind their own personality. And expects everyone else to jump through hoops for their kids.\nFunny enough. Some of those same people are the ones, once kids move out. Who ends with life crisis, becouse they don't know what to do now, becouse they have only been \"parents\" or end up constantly meddling in their adult children's life. \n\nMaybe remind your brother he is a person too, besides being a parent. \nYou can still be a good parent and enjoy an adult only night.", ">while we love to watch children run and play, this is an adult only kind of day.\u201d\n\nThis is  cute, and I love it. However, I have a better suggestion for RSVPS. DO NOT ALLOW ANY WRIGGLE ROOM. It may cost more if buying invites (and is easy enough to do if you're making your own) but instead or yes, no and plus one with tick boxes, put the actual name on the invites eg Mr Smith \u25a1will attend \u25a1won't attend Mrs Smith \u25a1will attend \u25a1won't attend and no blank plus one's.\n\nOh and I am a mother of 3 and love kid free weddings.

And then usually fob their brats off on the nearest girl between 13 and 20. Meanwhile everyone else here for their children day give them thinly veiled disgusted looks the whole time...", "Absolutely agree.\n\nI have a friend. Or we don't talk much because she's \"one of those parents\" \nWe had a phone call a few months back. And she was complaining. \"Oh, my kid is almost adult. What will I do with my life now!\" \nShe did not appreciate it when I told her. Maybe it was time to get some hobbies. Stuff she enjoyed. (Said in a much nicer way), and personally, I was enjoying picking up reading again in the evening now that my kids aren't small anymore. The youngest is old enough to sleep through the night.\nIt was like I had insulted her personally and kicked her child out before time. Loud gasps and pearl clutching. Followed by but... I'm the parent. Evenings was for laundry folding and making her baby's lunch and what else needed done. \nAnd then a long scolding how she can't understand why I don't do the same."]}
