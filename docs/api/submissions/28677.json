He got pissy and then told me later on that I made my niece cry. She\u2019s 3.. bet you she doesn\u2019t even remember that convo. \n\nThe story gets worse, he speaks to my mom after threatening her that they won\u2019t be attending if their kids can\u2019t come. I just went to be clear I love my niece and nephew with all my heart, but I\u2019m not about to subject the one day I\u2019m spending money on to celebrate my relationship with a bunch of variables. My mom gets upset at me and says how could you they\u2019re blood and I flat out said that if you people are going to be this self centered then I\u2019m happy to get married at city hall.

We\u2019re allowing nieces and nephews only but she imposed this on myself to set up HMU for my niece too (it\u2019s supposed to be special between my daughters and I).

Lots of people have a no kids policy at weddings. If in that case someone does brings kids it can cause major friction with other guests who respected your wishes and made arrangements.\n\nYour brother sounds like a total ass making his own daughter cry over this.  That wasn't your fault, that was his.", "NTA- let him throw his tantrums.", "You should just do city hall. \n\nYou either want all the hoopla or you don't want all the hoopla.\n\nYou either want to be the center of attention or you don't. \n\nSo make up your mind and do what you want.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not everybody wants kids in their wedding party. I didn't; we also had a child-free wedding. My own brother was saying stuff like if we were inviting my partner's nephews, then my own nieces and nephews should be invited. I irritably told him we were having NO kids at the wedding. Some people think their kids should be front row centre at everything!", "So I actually worked in the wedding industry years ago prior to switching careers and those costs just add up. I\u2019ve dealt with the craziest dynamics of in laws and bridezillas. It\u2019s nice of you to do this. I probably would too but I\u2019m also meticulous and type A so I analyze all of the what ifs and it just wasn\u2019t in the cards for me let alone my fianc\u00e9 who is very mellow and just doesn\u2019t want it to be a big thing. \n\nI genuinely just think my brother is being selfish and by not reaching out to me to squash the nonsense since I still have not even planned anything just shows he\u2019s really the toddler in this situation. It does upset me and I know of many wedding incidents where family doesn\u2019t speak. I would hate for that to be the case because I don\u2019t think I did anything to warrant this behavior. I also didn\u2019t mention but he has thrown sly comments about how my fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t a good fit for me or judgey statements about why he isn\u2019t proposing prior to the engagement and that I shouldn\u2019t tolerate it. I have never and will never feel the need to defend my relationship but with him acting out now it just makes it worse in my opinion.", "Nah, he IS an entitled child...", "Isn\u2019t it funny how when people have kids they suddenly completely forget the trauma of their own wedding dramas and believe their kids need to be in the headline of every event??? Like hello I\u2019m not doing this wedding and spending thousands of hard earned dollars so that you 3 year old can scream before I walk down the isle and get her sticky fingers all over everything? Is it that much to ask for a drama free day that revolves around just us ?", "I even politely said to his wife like hey can you just grab the phone for a second away from the kids when I told them that it wasn\u2019t an option. I didn\u2019t want them to hear and didn\u2019t want to lie and brush it off for another time.", "Honestly we\u2019re trying to get a car and a house first. Hopefully in a year the BS will have died down. We are also doing city hall regardless to buy the house so the question will be do we still want to ceremony and reception down the line or are we just happy as is and move forward. I really just wanted to have that day for us but not if people get nasty. At the end of it we\u2019re already married so do we want to spend extra funds on a day of our dreams or travel to New Zealand for an epic honeymoons haha. Not worth it to argue with my fianc\u00e9 over dumb shit that isn\u2019t a priority for us. Rather invest in us.", "He is, just like my mom, having the expectation to your wedding. I feel the same. It\u2019s your wedding and make sure it\u2019s what you want and if your brother wants to be upset, let him. It\u2019s not his day", "well lets hope for you your brother doesnt just show up with kids in tow to the wedding becuase he might do that", "I think just as an added precaution I may add a statement on the invite. Something along the lines of \u201cwhile we love to watch children run and play, this is an adult only kind of day.\u201d Or not give the option of plus 3 and 4 just state the number based on who is named on the invite. That way it\u2019s clear.", "i like the while we love to watch the children run and play this is an adult only event.  \n\nthe only other compromise i can suggest and i seen it at other weddings is the couple hire on site babysitting service so the adults can drop of children and attend the event but then again your brother doesnt sound reasonable when it comes to his kids lol"]}
