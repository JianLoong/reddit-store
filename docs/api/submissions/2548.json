People with this trait have generally learned (often through problematic childhood factors, such as a parent like your FIL) that the value they bring to their relationships is through help they can offer; they\u2019ll make any sacrifice to maintain the \u201chelpful\u201d identity, in part because they\u2019ve been pushed to define themselves by it and in part because they think that\u2019s the quality that earns them love and connection. Often, they do more harm than good, as they offer \u201chelp\u201d to people who actually need firm boundaries. It also creates resentment in the long term, as they eventually need support and feel hurt if others aren\u2019t as self-sacrificing as themselves. Learning the importance of healthy boundaries is critical not only for them, but also for their loved ones. I say this as someone who is inclined towards codepency, and working on unlearning some unhealthy relationship patterns.", "That is very much the case definitely will have to show him some studies of that.

If he didn\u2019t pay them him and his brother who were 11 and 13 at the time would be in a house with no water or electric. Once he moved out and stopped helping his father he lost his house. The legal proceedings of taking the house he drew out for years and years until they evicted him in 2020.

But he\u2019s gotta get his shit together on his own.", "NTA- DO not let him move in with you. You know he would not be a good addition to your home. He's your FIL not your child, you shouldn't have to treat him like one. He's already stolen from you, remind your fiance of this. You may have to let him know if he feels he must take in his dad, against your wishes you and your baby may have to make other living arrangements.", "NTA this is worth leaving over, if your fianc\u00e9 insists on sinking his boat you have an obligation to your child to get both of you out in to a life raft.", "Nta", "I have found places that only charge for the room like 500 a month! And he refuses and says he doesn\u2019t have the money. But he spend 200 plus a week at the motel. Well not him I guess whatever people he begs for money that is. I think he needs to be rocked with the real world and live out of his vehicle and humble himself. Or look into a shelter but I\u2019ve tried other avenues and even offered to look for him. He thinks he\u2019s too good for it. We found a good trailer for him a year ago and he refused because he thought he was too good for it. Laughable honestly.", "Thanks, it is tough.  I hope your husband gives this as much thought as you have.  It's easy to agree to being helpful on the surface without thinking about how almost every aspect of your lives will partially cater around his dad, every day, all the time.... the fights, the restlessness, your social and personal lives, holidays, his behavior around your child, and basically doing everything for him that he can't or is not willing to do himself... It is grueling as hell.", "You would be the one stuck with doing more housework, unless your fianc\u00e9 is the rare man who genuinely does most of the housework.", "NTA.\n\nI went through this with my own dad. He remarried after my mom died (I was 6) and their relationship was toxic, mu childhood was not fun. I left home at 17 and supported myself. When I was 23 stepmom left him. He was retired, fixed income but owned the family home. Could never manage money so I'd get calls to help with money for bills since \"the kids\" eg my half siblings were coming over. He moved out of the house to give her and their kids a place to live with no plan of what he would do. He moved in with me to my 1 bedroom flat after yet another phone call where he was crying. I gave him 2 months to work with a lawyer to get his house back (step mom was working), he did nothing. Some friends of his let him house-sit for them for a month and when they got back he wouldn't move out, they literally threw him out after 3 weeks of that. Yes, phone call and back to me. \n\nThe stress cost me my boyfriend, I got fired from my job, I was supporting him so savings were non existent. My beloved saint of an aunt finally told him to come to her house for a while and within 2 weeks he'd got his house back. Of course that didn't stop the manipulation, including several hard hearted suicide attempts. I got so fed up of it I applied to migrate to another country and left when I was 26. I cut him off in my early 30s and went NC since it was always about him wanting money etc. By this time he'd sold the family house, I'd worked with social workers to get him into a retirement village and he proceeded to spend all of the house proceeds within 3 years (on god knows what) so that he could get rent benefit. never paid back any of the family for money they'd given him over the years, including my sainted aunt who had apparently once co-signed a car loan for him and he stuck her with the payments.\n\nTL:DR Leopards never change their spots and parents should not sponge off their kids.", "NTA. Hold firm. You notice he doesn't live with his girl friend either.Hold firm [OP. You](https://OP.You) will never get this leach out of the house. Do not let him receive mail at your house as he can use it to establish residency in some places.", "Don't marry him, don't share any bank accounts / credit cards with him.  Change all your online passwords and do not share them with him.", "Tell her that having a roof over your baby\u2019s head and food in the baby\u2019s mouth and providing a stable financial environment for the baby that she decided to bring into this world is more important than that \u201cfamily\u201d because once she choose to bring the child into this world with you, you and baby should have become priority", "NTA, if he already tried stealing then he'll try again, and by living there he will have an easier time.  Not to mention getting him out will be difficult.\n\nDo you have shelters in your area that you can direct him to?", "NTA - I'm trying to figure out why there is conflict here. Is your guy insisting that he live with you? If he is, I would run. I would take my baby and run as far and as fast as I could. The guy is only going to continue to mooch because he needs a better job in order to support himself obviously. I can't speculate as to why he doesn't decide to get another job but that's on him. He knows what his circumstances are and anyone with half a brain knows what it takes to be self-supporting.", "NTA", "NTA! Realize that it's a cliche of this sub, but maybe cut off contact with him. Doesn't sound like there's an upside to associating with him.", "NTA and no ma'am! Stealing his sons credit card???!!! Oh HELL no. He would be banned from my home and every family gathering.", "OP=NTA\n\n1) FIL's home was a health hazard--he would make your home a health hazard--you and your baby's health take priority(your fianc\u00e9 can make his own choices on where he ranks his health on the priority scale which is why I leave him off this part).\n\n2) FIL stole from your Fianc\u00e9(and because you currently reside together it's the same as stealing from your finances too).  Letting a thief in the house is not a wise idea\n\n3) he has been physically aggressive with/against Fiance--what guarantee do you have that he wouldn't get aggressive/abusive with you or your child?--this is a safety factor.\n\nIssue the ultimatum to your Fianc\u00e9--You need to protect yourself and your child.", "NTA I know people who have relatives move in, and they won't leave. They stay with family and go on vacations, go to the bars. Save nothing to move out on their own, because they are comfortable. Sponging on relatives is easier than making it on your own.\n\nIt sounds like your FIL needs a career change. Minimum wage has gone up so he could make a lot more even doing a min. wage job.\n\nI would rather give someone money, then have someone move in. My home is a sanctuary where I can relax and be at peace. I can run around in a night shirt or a towel. Having someone else here would change that. It changes the atmosphere in your home.", "I know. I am not wavering and I know not a single person in my family or his family (aside from his dad) would fault me for doing so either. He\u2019s out of hand and the enabling of his toxic choices have gone on too long. I\u2019m done and appalled at the choices he continues to make at his age.", "I know he will scoff at the mention of a shelter. However I will do that anyways.", "Yes his father is insisting on living with us. He has no shame. My fianc\u00e9 told him he\u2019s done helping him and tonight he called him twice but he was sleeping so they went to voicemail. My fianc\u00e9 better stand his ground because im standing mine. However I can see how your father crying and pleading would give someone hesitation but it\u2019s non negotiable. I can\u2019t live with that man.", "Low income housing too is something to sign up for. A lot of areas have long wait lists but get on it anyway. You can always turn it down if you win the lottery.", "My fianc\u00e9 is a male. But yes he also chose to have the baby and he should choose us over his father period. I\u2019m done compromising. Enough is enough.  The father will not live here and I hope my fianc\u00e9 does not broach the subject with me again because I will not budge and I will not be nice in my response to said question.", "And a healthy, safe \"roof\"--the description of the FIL's home --can you imagine a baby crawling on those floors???", "What reading material would you recommend on this topic?", "NTA If he has a girlfriend he can live with her.", "NTA. You deserve for yourself to have a nice home, and you also want your child to have a nice home.\n\nBut I think you need to see that your real problem is your fiance. The fact that you're even having this conversation is a problem. Your fiance has poor boundaries with his father and feels that he must make himself usable for his father. You need to tell your fiance to put work into himself because this is unacceptable", "NTA Do not let strange men that you don't know into your house. He could do anything inside your house and kill you", "NTA.  You have a fianc\u00e9 problem, not a FIL problem.  You need to realize your fiance will sink you two and your child to help his father.  Why would you have a baby with this person?  He does not have sound financial judgment to be in a relationship and have a child.  Good luck getting child support out of someone that hands over money to a relative that will mooch forever.", "That may work for them however I just have so much anger and resentment towards this man I\u2019m not capable of that. He has done some unforgivable things over the years. I don\u2019t have that battle left in me. 7 years I\u2019ve watched him demand money from my fianc\u00e9. We met at 18 and now we are 26 with the same issue. There isn\u2019t any conditions I could make to justify him living here unfortunately.", "Yeah at this point I would be mostly concerned about the welfare of my baby. I would not want them living in squalor like that.", "This right here, you should look into freezing your baby's credit right now", "Then you are doing the right thing.", "If he starts making comments about being homeless just make very sweet comments back about how there's literally everywhere is hiring and he should go check out a few places because it would be a whole lot less stressful for him to have a consistent job than to ask for money constantly from everybody seriously you're going to have to put your foot down people like him don't stop until you stop them", "I was reading an article by a finance expert that struck me.  You don't solve other people's money problems with money.  You are just enabling them to continue the problem behaviors.  So your fianc\u00e9 giving him money is actually making the issue worse -- he's hurting his father, not helping him.  And at the same time, he is hurting you and his own child.", "NTA absolutely not, especially with a baby.", "NTA but outta curiosity does FIL have any mental illness/trauma/ptsd? I only ask bc my elderly father is (honestly) cleaner than you\u2019ve described your FIL, but my dad has a bunch of undiagnosed issues that definitely play a part in how he keeps his house, animals, and personal health."]}
