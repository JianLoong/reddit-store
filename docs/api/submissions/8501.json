I don\u2019t know much about Maria, only that she is going through a divorce and it\u2019s obviously a lot. I\u2019ve done my best to be friendly while giving her space.\n\nBut Maria\u2019s been causing problems since the day she moved in. One of her sons is up late every night yelling at his video games. I turn on a white noise in my bedroom and will still wake up at 1 or 2am most nights because one of the boys will not stop yelling at his video games.\n\nAnother issue is that Maria has a dog, even though our building does not allow them. The dog constantly whines and scratches in the room next to my kitchen. I don\u2019t think it ever gets taken outside. It\u2019s just stuck in the laundry closet all day.\n\nI\u2019ve tried talking to Maria, just asking her to please keep the noise down at night. I also told her that I wouldn\u2019t report the dog but to try and take the poor thing out because it\u2019s not healthy for it to just stay in a small space all day.\n\nMaria has always made passive-aggressive comments like \u201cYou know, earplugs are a few dollars at the gas station\u201d or \u201cI really don\u2019t see how it\u2019s your business though.\" I can understand being short-tempered, since she is dealing with a lot. But Maria still said that she would deal with the issues.\n\nThere\u2019s never any change. After the fourth time that I talked to Maria and nothing happened, I scheduled a meeting with our building manager and explained the issues.\n\nI had a paper stuck to my door last week from Maria saying that she and her sons will be stuck living in her car and she hopes that I\u2019m happy. I took a picture of the paper and started explaining the situation to other people.\n\nI learned that two other neighbors near Maria were also being bothered by her but they just hadn\u2019t said anything to the building manager. They and most of the other people I asked agreed that being divorced with children is hard but it doesn\u2019t exempt Maria from the rules.\n\nA friend and some family members told me that Maria was right about the dog being none of my business, decent earplugs are six dollars at most, and that I was being an unempathetic ass toward Maria.\n\nThey are saying that as someone who grew up with a divorced mom, I know how hard it can be and that I should have been more patient and understanding of Maria\u2019s situation. But instead I became the definition of a Karen by telling the manager on a person just trying their best with the circumstances.\n\nTheir words are making me re-consider if I really did the right thing by telling the building manager about my issues with Maria.

You warned Maria and gave her a chance to correct her behavior. This isn\u2019t your fault. Maria only has herself to blame for her actions.", "First of all, you tried reasoning with her, and gave her a chance to fix the issues. \n\nSecondly, sleeping with earplugs is rough and probably really bad for your ears.\n\nThird, most communities wouldn't evict a resident for a single offense, meaning she had probably already caused other problems you don't even know about. \n\nLastly, if she was presented with the choice of rehoming her pet or letting her children live in a car, and she chose not to re-home the pet... She's an AH of such astronomical proportions that I cannot even comprehend it.\n\nNTA OP. Don't let anyone guilt you into thinking otherwise.", "NTA, while her situation is hard it's on her to parent her child into NOT yelling at 1 am.  Also ear plugs while sleeping are not great and can cause effects when used long term.  You did your part by approaching her first and she chose how this went down.", "NTA. Going through tough times is not a get-out-jail-free card for being a fellow human being capable of considering those around you.\n\n>I had a paper stuck to my door last week from Maria saying that she and her sons will be stuck living in her car and she hopes that I\u2019m happy.\n\nThis her blaming YOU for the repercussions of HER actions.

There are quiet hours for a reason and she is in violation of the lease by having undeclared pet. A noisy one to boot.", "NTA. You asked repeatedly for her to do something and she didn't. She got herself evicted, and that's not always easy these days.", "I stopped at her having a dog when the building does not allow them.  Nope, just nope.  NTA.", "NTA - you pay rent there too and follow the rules (I\u2019m assuming). She and her family need to as well. She signed a lease that said no dogs. Just because you\u2019re having a hard time in life doesn\u2019t mean that becomes everyone else\u2019s problem. Earplugs can help, but honestly they\u2019re uncomfortable and can easily make you miss your alarm in the morning. They can also increase the chances of ear infections among other things. You shouldn\u2019t have to regularly jeopardize your health so she doesn\u2019t have to tell her child to keep his mouse level down.", "NTA, especially if others around you were being bothered as well.", "NTA, It's hard for anyone that comes from a house and into an apartment.  The kids don't realize they are being loud.  They don't get that there is someone right on the other side of the wall. Maybe, you could have asked Maria if you could talk to the boys yourself.  Explain to them your issue.  Because, Maria sends your words in one ear and out the other.\n\nIn the end, rules are rules.  I will be moving into an apartment soon.  It's been 25-30 years since I have lived in an apartment.  I hope everyone is cool.", "NTA. It was a consistent issue and you addressed it with her before going to the building manager.", "NTA, you\u2019re a human being, not a door mat.", "NTA.  You gave her ample opportunity to get a handle on the kids.  Maybe some time living in the car will teach her (or the kids) that raising a finger to The Man (however one defines \"The Man\") can have some pretty severe consequences.", "NTA", "Nah NTA. You tried to talk with her and she's being inconsiderate. YOU didn't get them kicked out she got them kicked out by being too loud and breaking apartment rules. Her circumstances don't matter in my opinion. You pay rent you shouldn't be being woken up at 2am because a kid is yelling all the time.", "Nta, divorce doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to keep people up all night and it\u2019s extremely abusive to lock a dog in a room all day. When you move into an apartment of course you expect noise around you but not at 2am that\u2019s ridiculous", "NTA. You are allowed to want to live in a comfortable environment. You tried to talk to her about the noise a few times and she blew you off. I'm sure your building has rules regarding noise levels and her refusal to follow them is why she is getting evicted. You sound like a very understanding neighbor and you tried to work it out among yourselves but she refused. Divorces are hard but it's not a free pass to allow her kids to make noise until 2 AM and neglect your animals.", "NTA, you were reasonable and empathetic towards Maria and gave her a chance, but it sounds like she did not care how her household affected those around her. You have a right to peace in yours. It\u2019s unfortunate but completely understandable that you would have to report her.", "NTA she was not following building codes and allowing her children to be a nuisance. She should have not allowed it to get to the point that you asked her multiple times and had to contact the building manager. It\u2019s her fault she\u2019s getting kicked out of the building not yours.", "NTA Maria is an adult, she needs to acts as one. Being respectful and responsible is not a difficult task. Divorce sucks, but it's not an excuse to be a crappy neighbor. Hopefully she doesn't get evicted and instead it's a wake up call to be a better neighbor. Good on you for trying to take a different approach until you were left with no other options. You are entitled to your peace and quiet too. Hope life gets better for everyone involved.", "NTA - Raised by a single mom, would never be loud and disrespectful late at night when younger. No excuse for their behavior, especially their treatment of the dog that is Not allowed. Their poor judgment with the dog is the nail in the coffin, no pets allowed, don't have pets or you get 86'ed.", "NTA. You asked nicely several times. Going through a divorce is zero reason to act like an AH to your neighbors. Whatever happens with the landlord, she did to herself.", "Nope NTA here. I personally understand that divorce is hard and it\u2019s very difficult to adjust to the new normal. Maybe she\u2019s gone from living in house to now suddenly having neighbors all around, being being a bad neighbor isn\u2019t cool. You gave her four chances and she essentially spat in your face. If her secret dog wasn\u2019t a nuisance, that\u2019d be one thing, but she\u2019s abusing the poor thing. If she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s important enough to tell her son that screaming at all hours of the night is inappropriate, then she has no one but herself to blame. She\u2019s done this to herself, so hopefully this will teach her humility.", "NTA.", "Nta, But I worry about that poor dog. \ud83d\ude1e", "NTA. You followed all of the appropriate steps. She blew you off. She misread the building culture and was inconsiderate and allowed her children and clandestine dog to interfere with her neighbors peaceful enjoyment of their residences that went beyond normal neighborly noise.", "The only mistake you made is trying to contact her four times before going to property management. If you can't get through to someone and you tried talking to them twice, it's definitely not going to work the third or fourth time. And complaining to property management on its own won't get them kicked out, because property management doesn't really care what one upset resident thinks. On the other hand, if many people are complaining and the person is breaking the rules of the building, then they might get booted.\n\nIt's tough to deal with kids who are noisy. If that alone were the issue, I would be somewhat sympathetic with your neighbor. But they had a dog when they shouldn't have had a dog, they knew trouble was brewing, and they did nothing to deal with it. You can't fix that, but maybe eviction will.", "NTA at all. The dog is what does it for me. That poor thing :( \nHer actions are what evicted her, try not to feel too guilty.", "NTA. You addressed the situation with her several times and she chose to ignore you. It's not you chose to go to the manager after talking to her once. She should have been more considerate of her neighbors.", "NTA.", "NTA.  It\u2019s her own doing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Cutting some slack for the person who is trying I totally get but why would you cut slack for someone who isn't making any effort to address the issues?", "NTA.  The correct thing to do would be to talk to Maria one on one and explain your concerns, which you did, MULTIPLE TIMES.

It's not your responsibility to let an entitled woman run roughshod over all her neighbors because she's a single mom. Sleep is too important to your health to be dealing with this crap.

However, the kids yelling at video games the early hours of the morning is not acceptable.", "NTA - you needs to be able to sleep too", "NTA. You tried all reasonable things. Yes, a divorce is hard but there's no need to take it put on others. And you were concerned for the dog and rightly so. One should not lool away when weaker beings are neglected. Sad she is too proud to give up her dog. Giving up a dog if you are not able to provide care for it does not mean you are a bad owner, quite the opposite. Way too many people do not understand that.", "NTA", "NTA.

It's hard letting go but you have to do what's best for your dog. Being stuck in a laundry closet all day is no way for a pet to live.

They're not for people whose neighbors scream at the TV in the middle of the night.", "Exactly", "If it were truly just about getting a handle on the kids for yelling, I wouldn't get the family kicked out because she doesn't know how to control her teenagers. I've had teenagers myself; it can be hard, and they don't always listen no matter what you try to do... natural consequences are basically useful for that if they're within a range that's safe for the kid and others, but homelessness is not at that level. Even brief homelessness while they find another apartment. I've been there; it's not something I would wish on a family for a teenager's mundane misbehavior (as opposed to a crime that the rest of them try to cover up or something).\n\nBut nobody is *incapable* of not moving into a dog-prohibiting building without bringing a dog. If the dog is really that important to them, there exist buildings that allow dogs, and they don't even necessarily cost more; they're just less convenient or easy to arrange. If they can't be bothered to find a place that allows dogs, then that tells me they can get by with rehoming the dog and it would probably be better for it anyhow. \n\nWhat's more, the fact that they did choose to move into a no-dogs building with a dog makes me much more skeptical that this is really a case of an involved mother who's doing a good job raising her kids and still can't get that one kid to stop yelling at his machine in the middle of the night, rather than a case of a mother who's feeling harassed and stressed enough to decide she doesn't really give a damn whether her kid plays games all night even if he can't keep his temper and wakes up the neighbors. Because people who think that rules apply to others but not to them in one type of case are more likely to in other types, too. \n\nNTA.", ">The dog is what does it for me.

So if OP is seen  walking the dog, wouldn't that cause trouble for OP?", "Hardly worth the verdict of AH. ,\"ESH\" I could kind of agree with you, but straight out AH?", "It\u2019s abuse, just straight up animal abuse. What kind of breed is the dog? It\u2019s not ok for any dog but if she\u2019s got a terrier or pit bull then locking it up and never letting the dog exercise is especially cruel. NTA. \n\nAlso, her son consistently being up til 0100 is really bad for the kid. The solution is her actually parenting her kid, not you getting earplugs."]}
