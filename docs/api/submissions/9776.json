Do you actually want your sister at your wedding to celebrate with you, or are you just looking for an excuse to be awful to her? Really, she's \"playing the depression card\"? Her husband *died*. Ten days after her own wedding. I get that it happened a few years ago, but she's allowed to still grieve about it.\n\nWhy do you want her at your wedding? You said yourself that your relationship is rocky and you seem to have a very low opinion of her. So why are you insisting?", "YTA.  Look, I personally think being afraid to attend another wedding more than five years after her loss - which was unquestionably traumatic without quotation marks to dismiss it - is not the ideal recovery goal, but it isn't my grief or my recovery.  The problem is you thinking that someone with whom you have a difficult relationship in the first place is obligated to attend your wedding.  They aren't.", "YTA. Not only AH, I just see you're mean person. I feel sorry for your sister", "YTA - and totally low in empathy for mental health issues.   Total AH the way you talk about her mental health.   And then encouraging the family to jump on.   That sucks.   At least your finance sounds like a nicer person.", "YTA.

Makes me wonder- are you inviting her to rub it in her face?? My sympathies to your sister. Please pray that your fiance does not find this side of you before the marriage. Hard YTA.", "YTA. She is traumatised and she has already explained to you in simple terms why attending a wedding would trigger her trauma again. You respond by showing no empathy for her mental health and accuse her of using it as an excuse. You are invalidating her. As if that is not hard enough to deal with you have asked other family members to encourage her to attend even though she does not feel able to. You are all being unsupportive and are putting so much pressure on her. No wonder your relationship is rocky. I would not attend your wedding either", "Yta. She's allowed to be selfish and protect herself from bad feelings. If someone won't be happy at your wedding why pressure them to come anyway? It sucks but you should try to enjoy your day without her there.", "YTA 100% \n\nJust because you lack empathy and compassion, doesn\u2019t mean that people don\u2019t experience these very real feelings of depression when their partner dies.

You invited her and she doesn't want to come, you have no place forcing her regardless of her reasons.\n\nAs for her reasons, she got married at 19 to her first love who died of cancer, leaving her scarred forever and just because it was 6 years ago and she knew he'd die, she should be fine. You don't make that call. You lack empathy. Also if she was attention seeking, she'd come and make this about her but no, she chose to stay away and I think it's the right decision.\n\nGrow up.", "Might want to work on your empathy, buddy.", "> \"trauma\" \n\n> even tho she knew her husband would die soon after their wedding cause he had late stage cancer\n\n> and it was 6 years ago, so by all means she shouldn't be so traumatized that she'd avoid any and all weddings, including mine\n\n> I feel like this trauma thing is just an excuse not to come cause we've always had a rocky relationship, but c'mon now, it's my wedding, she should put that aside and support me during my biggest day\n\n> \"harassing\"\n\n> but nobody has been harassing anyone and I feel like she's once again playing the \"depression card\" so she can get away with her unfair treatment\n\n> AITA ?\n\nYES.

Even if she's not traumatized, your attitude towards dealing with trauma alone may still have kept her from attending your wedding.\n\nHope your fiance leaves you at the altar!", "Wanting your sister there is nice but YTA because you\u2019re minimizing her feelings. Let her skip & get your family to back off. Stop bugging her about it.\n\nP.S. some people mourn for the rest of their lives & can\u2019t get over the pain. My mom lost my older brother when I was 3\u00bd, I\u2019m now 48 & she\u2019s been mourning him for 45 years. It literally drove her insane & suicidal when I was little. It ate at her for decades, still does which is the main reason I\u2019m NC with her.

If she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable coming, you shouldn\u2019t try to bully her about it", "Yeah YTA, you ARE kind of bullying her into attending.  \n Yeah maybe she doesn't want to come, why are you going to make her?

I'm still incredibly fucked up from it despite a decade of counseling, intensive trauma therapy, and medication. If a family member suggested I \"suck it up\" and endure an incredibly triggering event, and then insinuate that I'm being selfish for protecting my mental health, I'd seriously consider cutting them out of my life for good. \n\nI don't know you from Eve, but just judging by this situation, you're a monster.", "Your fiance sounds like a nice person. Only one at the wedding who sounds like he has a heart. Keep this up and he may also skip the wedding when he sees how poorly you all treat the sister.", "Easy YTA\n\nIt's not your place to judge if her trauma is real or not. She does not want to attend, as simple as that. \n\nGet over it or hold a grudge, pretty easy choices.", "YTA. There's no time expiration on trauma and grief. She's being open with you on the reason why she doesn't want to go and her triggers. You're just brushing it off as an excuse.", "YTA. \n\nWhy should she come support your wedding when you clearly didn\u2019t support hers? You even went behind her back to get your family to gang up on her. It\u2019s more important for you and then to pile on her, harass, and belittle her grief. You all are setting up great reasons for her to go no contact with the lot of you.", "YTA, it doesn't matter why she has said no, she's made it clear she doesn't want to come. Learn to take no as an answer and drop it.", "Judging by your extremely condescending \"tone\" it seems like you don't take her feelings seriously at all. YTA", "YTA The way you talk about her...

You don't get to decide when someone is done grieving.", ">so by all means she shouldn\u2019t be so traumatized\n\nI\u2019m sorry, are we now dictating what people can and can\u2019t be traumatized about?! YTA.", "Jesus fucking Christ YTA. You don\u2019t get to decide she should be over it. And your family sucks for piling on.\n\nConsider registering for empathy, because you clearly have none.", "YTA.  She obviously isn't ready to attend a wedding and hounding her about it is not going to change her mind.", "YTA. There is no time limit on grief, her trauma is real and doesnt deserved to be belittled and you got your family to bully your sister into needing time off work because of the stress. No wonder you have a rocky relationship. Family or not i'd cut you out of my life if you did this to me or someone i cared about.", "YTA. You know you can just type trauma without the condescending quotation marks right?", "Gods. This is AWFUL. You're AWFUL AND YTA. You're gaslighting your sister to make her do something she'll be MISERABLE doing and all you seem care about is yourself. How dare you question how a person grieves for their spouse!?? Weddings are hard for folks with romantic trauma. This is bridzilla bs. Stop it. Have some compassion. Everyone's life does not revolve around your wedding.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to dictate when she\u2019s done grieving and when she\u2019s ready to attend weddings. Not even yours. The way you talk about her and dismiss her gives me the chills.

No one can tell someone else how to grieve. Your sister was honest. Her grief doesn't need to make sense to you, or anyone else. Your expectation for her to \"get over it\", or \"suck it up\" is unreasonable and selfish.\n\nTreat her with the same respect and consideration that she did you. She told you that attending would be too much. Accept that.", "YTA Just seeing the quotes around the word trauma makes you the AH. Let it go.\n\nEdit to add: \u201cDepression card\u201d? I sincerely pity your fianc\u00e9, marrying a stone hearted woman.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to decide when she should get over her husband. Or what she considers traumatic. You admit that you had other family call her to try to convince her to attend your wedding. But then say no one is harassing her. Again, you don\u2019t get to decide that. Even if she felt the slightest traumatized, getting messages and calls from family trying to convince her to come to your wedding has to be exhausting.", "YTA. Why do you hate your sister? Just so you know time doesn\u2019t actually heal all wounds. Trauma can last your entire life that\u2019s why have 90 year old war veterans still having issues and having PTSD flashbacks. It doesn\u2019t matter if she knew he was gonna die 10 days is pretty short it\u2019s not like he died 10 months or even 10 weeks after the wedding", "YTA\n\nRegardless if you believe she has trauma or not, it's not your call. You invited, she declined.\n\nIf y'all aren't close, she may just not want to go.", "YTA. Putting trauma in quotes seals it. I hope you never have to go through something terrible and have someone label it \"trauma\".", "YTA. Even without the trauma that you're narcissistically dismissing, you said y'all have a rocky relationship. Judging from this post, I get why. For that alone she'd be not TA for skipping.", "YTA\n\nHer entire wedding experience was traumatic because it was wrapped up in the preparations for and eventual death of her husband. She associates weddings with death. There is no timeline where someone is over their grief and you have no right to demand that she be over it. Why should she want to go to your wedding when you are such deeply unpleasant and unsympathetic person?", "It sounds like you don't like your sister very much and you're very critical of her. I can see why she does not want to have a traumatic experience in your presence/on your special day, there won't be any understanding for her should she need to leave the event suddenly.\n\nShe declined an invitation to your wedding.  It was her mistake to tell you why she was declining the invitation because here you are passing judgment on her reasons, experiences and trauma.  \n\nI have a child with cancer. The stages of  diagnosis, treatment, learning likely outcomes, seeing outcomes -- each of these is a tremendous trauma. During a very traumatic part of her life, she was married to the person she loves and 10 days later her spouse died.  This person's cancer was not the \"only reason they even got married\" -- this person's cancer meant this was their only *opportunity* to be married.  \n\nYTA.", "YTA for not considering where she's coming from. You're only thinking about yourself here. \n\n Yes she knew the guy would die but she obviously was in love with him.

How dare you invalidate her trauma like that.", "YTA", "YTA. Grow up, a wedding isn\u2019t a Summons.", "Yes, YTA, you can't force anyone to attend your weeding. If they don't want to go, for whatever reason, it's their decision and you should respect that. And an even bigger YTA for implying she should be over it because ' it's been so long, and she knew it was gonna happen ', where's your empathy? You and 'your biggest day' don't get to dictate how someone deals with their trauma.", "YTA for the moment lets assume your sister is completely right and she will be triggered at your wedding. Do you really want someone sobbing at your wedding? No, you don't. It will be awful for everyone and take attention away from your pretty dress. \n\nNow there is an argument that given the circumstances she should have worked on it and be better by now but you aren't her. You don't know where her head is at. You don't know if she can soldier through. People heal at different rates. \n\nEven if you are right and she just doesn't want to come because she doesn't like you very much.

Everything is about me, she's jealous of me, everyone should do what I want despite the effect it has on them, no compromise. She should be over it because it's my day. She won't listen to me so I'm going to get everyone to pile on but it's not harassing or bullying it's just encouraging.\n\nDid you never learn to deal with disappointment? I would be disappointed if my siblings didn't attend my wedding, but if they had an objectively justifiable reason, even if I disagreed with it would be looking for compromise and accepting their decision. I'm guessing part of the reason she's not \"over it\" is because of a lack of support from her family who by the way also suck.", "YTA. She's made very clear how she feels. You need to respect that, even if it's not what you want. Tell her you understand, you're sorry this has stirred up her past, and to let you know if she changes her mind. Approach her with love and understanding.", "YTA. Her grief, trauma, and recovery do not work on YOUR timeline. It's no less tragic because they knew the diagnosis was terminal. You don't get to dictate when she's well enough to attend weddings. You're the selfish one, to phrase it mildly.\n\nYou said you have a rocky relationship with her. So why would she bring all that suffering upon herself again, going through an event that would massively trigger her, for someone that doesn't even try to empathize with her?", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t want to go to your wedding. It doesn\u2019t matter why. Leave her alone, tell your family to leave her alone & stop minimizing what she\u2019s going through.

Not only would you not take a no, you asked the family to harass her - yes, more than one person asking her to do something she already said no to is harassment.

The fact is, no one is going to care about your wedding as much as you do. And if it\u2019s too painful for her then that\u2019s for her to decide and for you to respect.

That's not to say that I would never experience happiness again, but I would definitely have a lifelong wound that would never heal as a result of going through an experience like that.\n\nIn terms of what you're asking of her, I think it's important to differentiate between what it would be like for her to go to *a* wedding, versus how it would affect her to be at *your* wedding. Despite your rocky relationship, your close proximity in age and the fact that you are sisters would add a whole other layer to what she would be feeling to see you starting your life with your new husband -- a feeling she *never* experienced, even on her own wedding day.

ASPD is a spectrum, like any other personality disorder, and people with it can feel empty and/or develop emotional attachment to one or two beings (whether that's their cat or their partner). They also can recognize their instinctive behavior is self-destructive and look for techniques that will help resolve that.
