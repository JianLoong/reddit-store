I asked Hannah in advance if she wanted to go with me and she agreed, she's a huge social butterfly and loves big events.\n\nThe venue is around a 2 hour drive from my home so I made it clear to Hannah that we need to leave in plenty of time to not be late. The ceremony started at 2pm, so I said we should aim to leave a little after 11am to allow for traffic and stop on the way if we need to.\n\nHannah is super into makeup and hair, and she was taking a very long time to get ready. When 10:30am rolled around, I gently reminded Hannah that we need to leave soon in order to get there on time. She told me she was nearly done and not to worry.\n\n10:50am rolls around and Hannah doesn't look anywhere near ready. I tell her that we really need to leave soon and reminded her of what time it is. Hannah told me to chill and that she's nearly ready.\n\nOnce it reached 11am, Hannah still wasn't ready. I told her that we need to leave ASAP. Hannah told me to calm down and that she's nearly ready, she wasn't even dressed yet!!\n\nI started getting panicky and told Hannah to please hurry up. Hannah got mad and said that she's told me she's nearly ready.\n\nBy the time it was 11:20am, Hannah STILL wasn't ready.\n\nI got really annoyed and told Hannah if she's not ready in 10 minutes, I'm leaving without her. I don't think she believed me: she just laughed and told me I'm being silly.\n\nI ended up leaving without her because by 11:30 she was still in her pjs. I managed to get to the wedding on time and it was great. After the ceremony, I noticed that Hannah had been blowing up my phone.\n\nI called her back and she immediately started screaming at me and said that I'm obsessed with being \"ridiculously early to things\" and said that I need to be more understanding and that if I waited 5 minutes she would've been ready. She said I'm a selfish jerk and need to evaluate my priorities. I wasn't able to get any word in before Hannah hung up the phone.\n\nSince then, Hannah has been ignoring me and I'm wondering if I was in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1667510095, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylf7w3/aita_for_leaving_my_girlfriend_behind_because_she/", "score": 3214, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have to have some cushion for travel time, it's not like a wedding is going to wait, and you don't want to show up late to something like that.", "NTA if you had not left you would have been late, a big no no at a wedding.

Put on the outfit at the 10:50 warning and take your makeup and hairbrush to the car.  She'd have two hours in the car to primp. \n\nI disagree with those who are questioning what time you actually got there, the implication being if you were 1/2 hour early, you could have waited to her longer. You needed to make sure a traffic setback that hadn't even happened yet wouldn't make you late. Everyone is supposed to be in their seats before the bride starts walking.   You need to leave extra time for traffic, it's a bonus if you don't hit it.", "NTA\\*  \n\n\nYou set an expectation as far as what you were expecting, and set it well in advance.

Since you were the primary \"invitee\" to the event I think you did just fine maintaining that boundary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will say that my whole family is chronically late to things so I get it.

Your power alpha move was to continue to push her to be ready on time and than leave without her because being on time was more important to you than having her with you.

Is this something that you (or her) would be able to continuously put up with? Think years from now, if you were thinking of long term with them. I saw this in my parent\u2019s as well-my dad is like me, my mom is like your GF-if my mom is BARELY on time, she counts that as \u201cearly\u201d.

They\u2019ve been together 40+ years and it\u2019s still a huge point of contention. \n\nThere\u2019s compromise, of course, but it honestly only goes so far. One guy I dated HATED that I was always early, so we compromised-you show up at the appointed time in your own car, I show up when I feel comfortable in mine. (In this wedding scenario, of course, not really feasible due to the distance, but you get what I mean). We didn\u2019t last (for other reasons) but either you make it work or-and I say this sparingly-cut your losses and move on. \n\nRemember: you\u2019re still in your honeymoon-ish phase.

All someone updating me on the time does is make me think, \"Oh, cool, I've got 30 minutes to finish this task,\" and keep right on doing it, because it isn't just blindness to what time it is, it's blindness to how much time what I'm doing takes. This goes especially if the upcoming thing isn't something that I particularly want to do, or is something I haven't had enough notice of. And, of course, \"enough notice\" is an incredibly nebulous thing as well, just for the extra PITA factor. I was ecstatic when places started sending reminder messages of upcoming appointments, but even with those, I've forgotten more than my fair share.

I can wake up, shower, dress, return equilibrium to my caffeine and nicotine levels ... and wait. I can maybe play solitaire or mah jongg on my phone; but not facebook or tiktok or reddit or my kindle - they take more attention/concentration leading to distraction and time loss.

I\u2019d have to declare that we\u2019re leaving at 10:30, which should get me out the door by 10:45, because I always think \u201cwaiting for the elevator & getting to the car & buckling kids in & one grown up running back to the apartment for whatever we forgot & setting up the GPS if necessary\u201d is gonna take 5 minutes when it really takes 10-15.)", "Exactly.

Alarms, visual reminders, prepping the steps of the getting ready process in advance, making the leaving time earlier than necessary, etc. \n\nMy partner is patient but in a circumstance where it would be important to be on time, ie a wedding, I 100% would be upset at myself but I wouldn't take it out on him if he ended up having to leave me.", "I have ADHD and it doesn\u2019t help at all if someone tells me the time. It\u2019s very hard to explain but it\u2019s like\u2026 time is a concept. \n\nHow I cope with \u201ctime blindness\u201d (because I am that person that is 30 minutes late to everything and makes everyone mad) is I set multiple alarms to alert me of the time. Why does this work better than my husband being my human clock?\n\nProbably the shame of being constantly reminded that I can\u2019t do anything punctually. So when it\u2019s an annoying alarm that I have to turn off, it keeps me in check and I can visually see the time. Someone telling me the time doesn\u2019t have the same impact. \n\n& I do mean alarms every 5 minutes sometimes to keep me in check.", "If you read the experiences of people in this thread who either have ADHD or have a partner/child who does, it is absolutely a thing. \n\nSome people are absolutely selfish and will not consider the needs of others. Some people have a condition that makes it very difficult for them to regulate their time. \n\nNot everything is black and white.", "Oh, I'm agreeing that she was definitely inconsiderate. I was only trying to state that even *if* she had the ADHD/time blindness problem, someone actually trying would likely to have... appeared to be trying, and they wouldn't flip out at the person trying to accommodate them ultimately not being able to.", "Oh, real, it's always the \"tHe BuS wAs LaTe\" argument. These people are chronically late \"because of the bus\"  so you'd think they'd learn to leave extra time, but no - it will always be acceptable in their eyes because it's always going to be the fault of the bus and never their own. For fucks sake, take an earlier bus. It ended a relationship of mine. Either they can't figure out a solution to such a simple problem or they just flat out don't respect other people's time. Usually the latter.", "What's a DOC", "i should go to bed", "Correct, they're controlling.", "I have ADHD and have become the person who wants to leave a half an hour earlier than necessary in case of whatever may happen.  \n\nI'd rather be early and sit in the car and wait than be the one who is habitually late for everything.   I've been that person and it's embarrassing.", "THAT is what OP's girlfriend has!", ">However, most adults with issues like time blindness are aware that they have difficulties in this area and learn to adapt for big events like this.\n\nI had 6 strokes over a couple of years in my early 30's and after that was late to everything. Drove my family nuts. They'd be ready to leave and I'd be racing around with my hair still wet.\n\nFinally one day a light went off and I realized that I was treating whatever time I needed to be somewhere as the time I needed to leave.\n\nNow I figure out my expected drive time, add 5-10 minutes to get a drink/jacket/etc, add X amount of time to get ready, **then** add ~30 minutes for good measure. It's a lot of thought the day before *every* appointment/event, but I am rarely ever more than 5 minutes late. And that happens because if I'm 1/2 awake I'll go back to thinking I can leave at my appointment time and then have to make up that time somewhere. \n\nPeople like the GF need to pay attention and figure out what makes them late. It's not reasonable to just make everyone else late with you!", "Yep, the only way I can be on time to work in the morning is to literally get up, do only the things I need to do to get ready, and then LEAVE. Even if I'm now \"running early\". \n\nHanging around (even waiting a few minutes for other people) once I'm ready makes me antsy because my brain tries to tell me I totally have time to do X, Y and Z. Just sit down and get out your phone! What could possibly go wrong??", "I hate it so much. Feels like I'm missing out life because I spend so much time waiting for life.\nIt also means that if I have plans to do one thing at the end of the day, it  kind of takes up a whole day's time...", "Make up in the car is always the answer, the lighting is the best,  and everything but eyeliner and lipstick happen while driving. \n Even half of hair(I have curly hair so I let it sit in gel cast till 15 min before arrival). Clothes and blowdryer happen at home everything else is travel friendly."]}
