I asked Hannah in advance if she wanted to go with me and she agreed, she's a huge social butterfly and loves big events.\n\nThe venue is around a 2 hour drive from my home so I made it clear to Hannah that we need to leave in plenty of time to not be late. The ceremony started at 2pm, so I said we should aim to leave a little after 11am to allow for traffic and stop on the way if we need to.\n\nHannah is super into makeup and hair, and she was taking a very long time to get ready. When 10:30am rolled around, I gently reminded Hannah that we need to leave soon in order to get there on time. She told me she was nearly done and not to worry.\n\n10:50am rolls around and Hannah doesn't look anywhere near ready. I tell her that we really need to leave soon and reminded her of what time it is. Hannah told me to chill and that she's nearly ready.\n\nOnce it reached 11am, Hannah still wasn't ready. I told her that we need to leave ASAP. Hannah told me to calm down and that she's nearly ready, she wasn't even dressed yet!!\n\nI started getting panicky and told Hannah to please hurry up. Hannah got mad and said that she's told me she's nearly ready.\n\nBy the time it was 11:20am, Hannah STILL wasn't ready.\n\nI got really annoyed and told Hannah if she's not ready in 10 minutes, I'm leaving without her. I don't think she believed me: she just laughed and told me I'm being silly.\n\nI ended up leaving without her because by 11:30 she was still in her pjs. I managed to get to the wedding on time and it was great. After the ceremony, I noticed that Hannah had been blowing up my phone.\n\nI called her back and she immediately started screaming at me and said that I'm obsessed with being \"ridiculously early to things\" and said that I need to be more understanding and that if I waited 5 minutes she would've been ready. She said I'm a selfish jerk and need to evaluate my priorities. I wasn't able to get any word in before Hannah hung up the phone.\n\nSince then, Hannah has been ignoring me and I'm wondering if I was in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1667510095, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylf7w3/aita_for_leaving_my_girlfriend_behind_because_she/", "score": 582, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She will continue to do this until there are consequences.", "NTA\n\nIt's incredibly disrespectful. I'd have done the same.", "NTA you told her a time to be ready by. She decided to not listen.

It is not reasonable of her to expect you to accommodate her lateness beyond a certain point.", "NTA, I've had friends who didn't respect time like that, they drive me batty (and are no longer friends). At some point you just need to do what you have to do. You have to have some cushion for travel time, it's not like a wedding is going to wait, and you don't want to show up late to something like that.", "NTA if you had not left you would have been late, a big no no at a wedding.

There is no excuse for not getting out to the car. \n\nI say this as someone who has issues with time management. It's not fair to make someone else late for something that's important to them. Put on the outfit at the 10:50 warning and take your makeup and hairbrush to the car.  She'd have two hours in the car to primp. \n\nI disagree with those who are questioning what time you actually got there, the implication being if you were 1/2 hour early, you could have waited to her longer. You needed to make sure a traffic setback that hadn't even happened yet wouldn't make you late. Everyone is supposed to be in their seats before the bride starts walking.   You need to leave extra time for traffic, it's a bonus if you don't hit it.", "NTA\\*  \n\n\nYou set an expectation as far as what you were expecting, and set it well in advance. When the time came you were gentle about reminding your partner of the timeframe. Since you were the primary \"invitee\" to the event I think you did just fine maintaining that boundary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will say that my whole family is chronically late to things so I get it.
