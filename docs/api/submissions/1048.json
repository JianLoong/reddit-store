I asked Hannah in advance if she wanted to go with me and she agreed, she's a huge social butterfly and loves big events.\n\nThe venue is around a 2 hour drive from my home so I made it clear to Hannah that we need to leave in plenty of time to not be late. The ceremony started at 2pm, so I said we should aim to leave a little after 11am to allow for traffic and stop on the way if we need to.\n\nHannah is super into makeup and hair, and she was taking a very long time to get ready. When 10:30am rolled around, I gently reminded Hannah that we need to leave soon in order to get there on time. She told me she was nearly done and not to worry.\n\n10:50am rolls around and Hannah doesn't look anywhere near ready. I tell her that we really need to leave soon and reminded her of what time it is. Hannah told me to chill and that she's nearly ready.\n\nOnce it reached 11am, Hannah still wasn't ready. I told her that we need to leave ASAP. Hannah told me to calm down and that she's nearly ready, she wasn't even dressed yet!!\n\nI started getting panicky and told Hannah to please hurry up. Hannah got mad and said that she's told me she's nearly ready.\n\nBy the time it was 11:20am, Hannah STILL wasn't ready.\n\nI got really annoyed and told Hannah if she's not ready in 10 minutes, I'm leaving without her. I don't think she believed me: she just laughed and told me I'm being silly.\n\nI ended up leaving without her because by 11:30 she was still in her pjs. I managed to get to the wedding on time and it was great. After the ceremony, I noticed that Hannah had been blowing up my phone.\n\nI called her back and she immediately started screaming at me and said that I'm obsessed with being \"ridiculously early to things\" and said that I need to be more understanding and that if I waited 5 minutes she would've been ready. She said I'm a selfish jerk and need to evaluate my priorities. I wasn't able to get any word in before Hannah hung up the phone.\n\nSince then, Hannah has been ignoring me and I'm wondering if I was in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1667510095, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylf7w3/aita_for_leaving_my_girlfriend_behind_because_she/", "score": 1434, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have to have some cushion for travel time, it's not like a wedding is going to wait, and you don't want to show up late to something like that.", "NTA if you had not left you would have been late, a big no no at a wedding.

Put on the outfit at the 10:50 warning and take your makeup and hairbrush to the car.  She'd have two hours in the car to primp. \n\nI disagree with those who are questioning what time you actually got there, the implication being if you were 1/2 hour early, you could have waited to her longer. You needed to make sure a traffic setback that hadn't even happened yet wouldn't make you late. Everyone is supposed to be in their seats before the bride starts walking.   You need to leave extra time for traffic, it's a bonus if you don't hit it.", "NTA\\*  \n\n\nYou set an expectation as far as what you were expecting, and set it well in advance.

Since you were the primary \"invitee\" to the event I think you did just fine maintaining that boundary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will say that my whole family is chronically late to things so I get it.

Your power alpha move was to continue to push her to be ready on time and than leave without her because being on time was more important to you than having her with you.

Forever late person here and it\u00b4s also likely she knows her lateness habits but is ignoring how they affect others. Like I know if I am late, it\u00b4s always by 10min and I warn people about this so they can adjust expectations/plans accordingly. Just saying \"I\u00b4ll be ready soon\" is BS.", "It's not like she has never put on makeup and clothing -- she knows how long that takes.  \n\nIf she is late more often than not, even for events that are very important to her, then she may have time blindness, which is a symptom of ADHD.  But OP didn't mention that she is frequently late, and if I were posting this, I would definitely mention if she had frustrated me in the same way on a regular basis.", "True but chronically late people will always be chronically late no matter how much the early arriver tries to accommodate them. I\u2019m an early arriver and used to hang out with chronically late people. Nothing worked. The one time I didn\u2019t go a trip with them, they missed their flight. After that, they STILL didn\u2019t even try to be remotely on time.\n\nOP you\u2019re NTA, at all. Leave Hannah alone, she\u2019ll never respect your time.", "Yes. Given the sequence described, it sounds like Hannah was potentially punishing OP for trying to hurry her so early. OP was rushing her and she was digging her heels in. But ultimately OP had set the departure time, and Hannah was dragging things on way too late, given the need for a good margin for error for the long drive. Hannah\u2019s slowness could mean she was intending for them to leave so they\u2019d just arrive in time to \u201cprove\u201d OP to be wrong. A powerplay.

You just barrel through the church and park.in the first pew.", "I can get dressed in less than five minutes, including shoes (I often get out of bed late, and have to decide which items of my morning routine I still have time for, so I have a pretty good idea of how long each item takes. Obviously I have to get dressed every day, but I look at the clock, subtract vital things like dressing and packing my bag, and then based on the time left, I can decide whether I'm gonna eat breakfast etc). \n\nSo to me, \"five minutes\" sounds legit if LITERALLY all she needed to do was dress. Which I severely doubt. Sounds like she was still on her makeup.", "Ah, you\u2019re right. My apologies.", "There is sometimes. I'm usually on time but juuuust barely. My husband shakes his head at me because I'm always literally sprinting around so that I'm not late.", "It\u2019s kinda relevant though. Most people don\u2019t leave an hour earlier than expected travel time. Most people don\u2019t assume a stop on a two hour drive assuming the car is gassed and your biologically functional.\n\nLike if it\u2019s me, and it\u2019s actually a 2 hour drive. I\u2019m leaving at 11:45. Giving yourself a 15% travel time buffer is reasonable.  More than that and your just disrespecting you and your guests time by insisting on getting to something early.", "And her comment saying \u201cif you\u2019d just waited another 5 minutes,\u201d - this is a complete lie and a mainstay of entitled people. They act like no one else\u2019s time matters, because it doesn\u2019t to them! If you have to wait 5 minutes or 5 hours, as long as their happy, they expect you to be happy too.\n\nPeople like this CAN change. But you have to be firm with them. Set clear boundaries, and stick to your guns. \nSo, if you say, I\u2019m leaving at 11. You do. No waiting an extra few minutes. No wiggle room. Just leave exactly at 11.\nGet everyone in their lives to do the same. It\u2019s not about being cruel.

The wedding starts at 2 doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s when you should park.", "I used to be very early for social things, I was just eager to have fun with my friends, some of my friends would rely on it because I'd get to parties over 30 minutes early and be willing to help with setting up, cleaning, finishing touches on cooking, etc., so the hosts could shower and change.  But some others told me that for parties it's better to arrive half an hour \"late\" than to arrive early, because it made them feel rushed, and it changed me, almost broke me, thinking I had inadvertently been rude.  Now, I aim for within 15 minutes either way of the scheduled time, for parties/gatherings.", ">I am a chronically late person unfortunately and I will add that I actually get anxiety getting somewhere too early\n\nI am not a chronically late person, but my parents were chronically early to the point of inconveniencing people sometimes and the anxiety I get about the idea of arriving an hour early now is real. I'm pretty good at timing it so that I get there a few minutes early and if I'm too early and it's appropriate I'll wait in the car until it's not *too* early.", "I'm usually 15-30 mins late to everything because I have ADHD. I'm easily distracted, so sometimes I'll have to run back into the house to grab my coat, or I'll just forget to add extra time for clearing the icy windscreen into my route. \n\nMy older bro is the opposite. He's 30 mins early to everything because he has anxiety and doesn't want to inconvenience anyone by making them wait. He will put in place plans for stuff I'd never even consider, like rain or a flat tyre. \n\nIf we need to go anywhere together, we usually end up being bang on time. Between him reminding me of literally\neverything I need to bring with me, and my ability to *still forget them*, we kinda balance each other out lmao.", "Thank you!", "You just raised all my gremlins!

I'm the type to leave it as late as possible to roll out of bed. But fancy wedding clothes are probably going to take more than 5 mins regardless. But yeah, she was nowhere near ready.", "Much appreciated!", "It\u2019s really not though. His girlfriend knew what time he wanted to leave at, it\u2019s not like he sprung it on her last minute and rushed her to get ready. She simply does not have respect for his time or others time if she expects people to wait on her getting ready. It\u2019s just basic decency to be on time.", "15 minute travel buffer isn\u2019t reasonable really for a lot of people at an event like a wedding. Finding parking or navigating the venue can add extra time. Not all venues are built alike and sometimes parking in a strange location can be far and difficult. Or the venue might have multiple locations the wedding might occur. I\u2019ve been to multiple weddings with tricky parking or large venues where it wasn\u2019t 100% obvious where the ceremony is. So if there\u2019s traffic and you need to find parking or the actual ceremony site, 15 minutes isn\u2019t going to cut it. \n\nI add extra time for a special event like a wedding, it\u2019s not like a movie or a dinner reservation", "Happy cake day!", "Damn I can\u2019t remember the last time I had a nice cake day flogging.", "Not unless time deafness is also a thing", "At that point, the person just isn't trying.", "Somewhat yes, plus there are other aspects of ADHD that can make the reminders not that useful and sometimes even counter productive.

Obviously she was not nearly ready, but time blindness can impact how long you think it will take to do something so she may genuine have thought '5 more minutes and I'll be ready'. \n\nHowever, most adults with issues like time blindness are aware that they have difficulties in this area and learn to adapt for big events like this. So yes she may have difficulties comprehended time and how long certain tasks will take, but it's not really an excuse for something like this", "Half of it is not realizing how much time has passed, but the other half is not being able to estimate how much time things will take.", "Part of it is being unaware of how long things take.
