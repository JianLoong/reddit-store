I asked Hannah in advance if she wanted to go with me and she agreed, she's a huge social butterfly and loves big events.\n\nThe venue is around a 2 hour drive from my home so I made it clear to Hannah that we need to leave in plenty of time to not be late. The ceremony started at 2pm, so I said we should aim to leave a little after 11am to allow for traffic and stop on the way if we need to.\n\nHannah is super into makeup and hair, and she was taking a very long time to get ready. When 10:30am rolled around, I gently reminded Hannah that we need to leave soon in order to get there on time. She told me she was nearly done and not to worry.\n\n10:50am rolls around and Hannah doesn't look anywhere near ready. I tell her that we really need to leave soon and reminded her of what time it is. Hannah told me to chill and that she's nearly ready.\n\nOnce it reached 11am, Hannah still wasn't ready. I told her that we need to leave ASAP. Hannah told me to calm down and that she's nearly ready, she wasn't even dressed yet!!\n\nI started getting panicky and told Hannah to please hurry up. Hannah got mad and said that she's told me she's nearly ready.\n\nBy the time it was 11:20am, Hannah STILL wasn't ready.\n\nI got really annoyed and told Hannah if she's not ready in 10 minutes, I'm leaving without her. I don't think she believed me: she just laughed and told me I'm being silly.\n\nI ended up leaving without her because by 11:30 she was still in her pjs. I managed to get to the wedding on time and it was great. After the ceremony, I noticed that Hannah had been blowing up my phone.\n\nI called her back and she immediately started screaming at me and said that I'm obsessed with being \"ridiculously early to things\" and said that I need to be more understanding and that if I waited 5 minutes she would've been ready. She said I'm a selfish jerk and need to evaluate my priorities. I wasn't able to get any word in before Hannah hung up the phone.\n\nSince then, Hannah has been ignoring me and I'm wondering if I was in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1667510095, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylf7w3/aita_for_leaving_my_girlfriend_behind_because_she/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Google maps takes into account traffic when it directs you so you would know what to expect if checked for driving time.\n\nI also doubt she was still in pj's if she had been getting ready with her hair and makeup by 1030.\n\nThe real question is, what time did you arrive at the wedding and how is the break up going?", "NTA- being disrespectful of peoples time and events is plain rude. She wasn\u2019t ready 30min after you were supposed to leave. This is her own fault.", "NTA. To people saying you were being too conservative are the ones who are habitually late. \n\nIt was a two hour drove, not 10 minutes. Google maps can guesstimate based on current traffic conditions but it can't predict an accident along tour route? a rainshower causing the need to reduce speed or an oversized vehicle with escort crew slowing down traffic with no way to pass. Etc. \n\nAlso the wedding was due to start at 2 but depending on the formality of the wedding, the venue etc, you need time to park, get to the ceremony location, hang your coat and find your seat, perhaps greet the priest if its in a church. No one wants to be that person trying to sneak into the wedding after it's already started. \n\nYou gave her a time to be ready. Even pushed it back by half an hour. She needed to start getting ready earlier. She disrespected your time. That is what it is. Disrespect.", "NTA it's a wedding you didn't want to miss.  She should be respectful of those things.", "NTA\n\nYou told her you wanted to leave at 11 am and you still gave her a 30-minute buffer by waiting until 11:30.  She knows this is a stressor for you.\n\nIf it\u2019s a 2 hours drive, giving yourself a 30 minute buffer for traffic delays etc is smart and I would not consider that \u201cridiculously early\u201d.  Nobody should be the AH who rushes past the bride as she\u2019s getting ready to enter the church because they didn\u2019t plan enough travel time.", "INFO: what time did you get to the venue?", "NTA. You told her to be ready to leave a little after 11 and she ignored you. Half an hour later she wasn't even dressed. People who behave like this are rude, self-important and inconsiderate. She then had that audacity to try to blame you. There was no way she would have been ready in another 5 minutes. She will continue to do this until there are consequences.", "NTA\n\nIt's incredibly disrespectful. I'd have done the same.", "NTA you told her a time to be ready by. She decided to not listen. I would have left exactly at 11am.. \nShe needs to learn time management and to be respectful of your time\n\nI like to be punctual.", "NTA - you gave her an extra 30 mins to get ready for an important event yet by the time you left she was still in her PJs, you gave her plenty of time but she didn\u2019t respect, take seriously or use the time wisely", "NTA. It is not reasonable of her to expect you to accommodate her lateness beyond a certain point.", "NTA, I've had friends who didn't respect time like that, they drive me batty (and are no longer friends). At some point you just need to do what you have to do. You have to have some cushion for travel time, it's not like a wedding is going to wait, and you don't want to show up late to something like that.", "NTA if you had not left you would have been late, a big no no at a wedding. Sounds like your GF either didn't want to go at all, or wanted to arrive late so all eyes would be on her and her amazing make up/ fashion.   \nHonestly, dump your GF, you can do better.", "NTA. I\u2019m a late person. But try not to be, I try to plan ahead. I try to start getting ready sooner than I think I should. I try to hurry. But it\u2019s hard. And if your eyeliner keeps f*ing up it\u2019s harder. Been this way my whole life.\n\nBut when it\u2019s an important even like a wedding? Especially if whoever I\u2019m with says \u201cno really, I want to be out the door in 10 minutes\u201d then I do whatever I can to be wrapped up and out the door in 10, or at least 12 minutes (because probably I\u2019ll forget where I put my shoes to be easy to find or anything have to go to the bathroom or I realized I left my dishes in the sink and I don\u2019t want to leave them there all day). I don\u2019t make you wait another half hour for me to still not be ready.", "NTA. She had a whole extra 30 minutes. There is no excuse for not getting out to the car. \n\nI say this as someone who has issues with time management. It's not fair to make someone else late for something that's important to them. Put on the outfit at the 10:50 warning and take your makeup and hairbrush to the car.  She'd have two hours in the car to primp. \n\nI disagree with those who are questioning what time you actually got there, the implication being if you were 1/2 hour early, you could have waited to her longer. You needed to make sure a traffic setback that hadn't even happened yet wouldn't make you late. Everyone is supposed to be in their seats before the bride starts walking.   You need to leave extra time for traffic, it's a bonus if you don't hit it.", "NTA\\*  \n\n\nYou set an expectation as far as what you were expecting, and set it well in advance. When the time came you were gentle about reminding your partner of the timeframe. Since you were the primary \"invitee\" to the event I think you did just fine maintaining that boundary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will say that my whole family is chronically late to things so I get it.

What time did you make it there after you left at 1130?", "NTA.\n\nYou wanted to get to the ceremony on time and advised Hannah of the time to leave and gave numerous time updates and warnings.

My anxiety can't handle being late to stuff (working on it, not much luck). I would have left her too, especially since she was being so blase about when she was going to be ready. You know her, if you thought she wasn't even close to ready, then she probably wasn't close to ready and waiting another 5 minutes wasn't going to do crap but make you more upset. If it was me, I'd take this as a sign we're not compatible. She blew you off several times when you reminded her, took her time knowing you were getting anxious, then when you left without her (after telling her you would), she attacked your habits and seemingly lied about how much longer it would have taken her to be ready in a blatant attempt to make you feel like crap.

It's always a good idea to show up a little before scheduled time so you have a few minutes to relax after the drive or flight.

If you are driving 2 hours to visit family for a couple days, being 30 minutes late isn't generally a big deal, because your arrival isn't tied to a specific event at a specific time.
