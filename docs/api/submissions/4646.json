She gets into it, says she wants to be exclusive and is done talking to other people at all, let alone dating other people. I'm fine with that, as I'm head-over-heels for this one. While we were dating, she got into an accident and her car got totaled. Of course I'm giving her rides to wherever she needs/wants to go in the meantime, and a few weeks later she gets a new car.\n\nThat car *immediately* starts having issues and needs to go into the shop. I continue giving her rides while this shop is doing some serious repairs that take nearly two weeks and the car still wasn't fixed a couple weeks ago when she got it back. Obviously, she took the car back as the work was warrantied, since it now had more problems than it did before. I'm still giving her rides (without complaint), mind you, as we're dealing with this shop's incompetence and the way-too-much-time it's taking them to fix the problems - and not asking her for a dime in gas, even with current prices.\n\nShe told me that she wants to be exclusive several weeks ago, which again, was fine by me, as I really liked her and I'm the monogamous type. She tells me yesterday (Monday) that she's actually been talking to someone since later in the week when she told me she wanted to be exclusive. She then asks if I'm still ok to drive her to the shop to see what's up with her car and take her to the laundromat tomorrow (today). I tentatively agreed, then when I showed up today, I asked her, willing to forgive and move on \"Did you do anything with this other guy?\" She responded that she made out with this guy Sunday night at the bar while I was at work and that she's 'not so sure about the exclusive thing anymore'.\n\nI then grabbed the few clothes I had at her place, took them down to my car and told her it would be best if she found a ride elsewhere to the laundromat, the garage, and wherever else she needed to go in the near future. I felt/feel like an absolute asshole, leaving her in tears, worrying about her car and how she was going to get everything done and everywhere she needed to be. My honor and following through on what I say I'm going to do means a lot to me, but I think a big part of personal honor is also knowing you have worth and not letting others use you after they've walked all over you.
