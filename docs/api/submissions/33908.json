If you didn't know that trigger and also your own safety was at risk, what else were you meant to do? She had every right to be upset because she will be dealing with her own trauma of course but it doesn't mean you're wrong, it's hard to live with someone with trauma, I honestly feel grateful that my own bf had the patience to deal with me when I get triggered. \n\nThe thing is though, like my bf, you said something that you didn't know was going to cause upset. I've gotten triggered but I also tell him what happened and why, it sounds like your gf did too so props to her. While her trauma is important, I hope you also were able to explain the danger you were in so that she understands not to joke about things like that in the first place if you're out in public", "NTA. Your girlfriend\u2019s behavior is very concerning.", "NTA. She was putting you at risk. That is much more concerning to me than accidentally and inadvertently using someone's trigger.", "She has an abusive father, yet joked about abuse? Loudly, in public? \n\nNTA.", "NTA. She's an abuse survivor who is triggered by certain phrases but jokes about making false abuse accusations? I'm not sure if this is her attempt to feel like she is in control of the situation, but it seems like a bad way to go about it.\n\nJoking about making false allegations is clearly an AH move, and being a survivor isn't a blank cheque to throw around allegations.", "NTA. There are two key points here\u2014first, you were unaware that the parade you used was a trigger phase. If you\u2019d known and used it anyways, that would make you an AH, but speaking as someone who also had an abusive father, there are too many possible triggers to tell someone all of them ahead of time. Sometimes someone will say something that triggers that trauma, but that\u2019s just something the she has to deal with as it comes up. Try not to use it again and that\u2019s the end of it.\n\nSecond, joking about abuse allegations, including false ones, is NEVER ok. You were 100% right to call her on it. It would\u2019ve been a bad joke in private, but in public? That\u2019s legitimately dangerous. \n\nYou should seriously reflect on your relationship with this person. What starts as a bad \u201cjoke\u201d can easily turn into a threat to be used against you. \n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve learned from therapy is that abuse has a lot of ways it can affect people. Most commonly, survivors fall into one of two groups after leaving the original situation\u2014those that are drawn to new abusers, and those that become abusive themselves. I\u2019m not saying your partner is definitely abusive, but it\u2019s possible that she is or is heading that way. \n\nIf you have the resources, I\u2019d suggest seeing a therapist. You could also benefit by learning more about warning signs of abuse in a relationship. With intimate partner abuse, the earlier you catch it and get out, the better off you\u2019ll be.", "ESH (mostly her)\n\nYou: implied she was stupid (= edit: she was but not the time to say it)\n\nHer: She could have put you at risk of physical harm. That was very immature. You told her to stop, she continued high-risk behavior.\n\nHer apology should be a strong one. Your error was inadvertent/smaller because you were frightened for good reason.\n\n\nedit: On second thought, if your comment was strong enough to shush her before you got beat up or worse -- since she was escalating the risk -- then maybe it saved you.", "What\u2019s funny about abuse? Can she actually explain how that was funny? She is not going to apologise because abusers don\u2019t apologise and what she did abusive. Embarrassing/humiliating/shaming you in public, putting you at harm and giving you the silent treatment when she is called out is abusive. If she doesn\u2019t recognise that you need to end the relationship and she needs therapy. NTA", "NTA. She really should use her brain in situations like that. Very dumb move on her part. You've done nothing wrong.", "In my opinion: NTA", "NTA she's out of line here. I think the only thing I'd say is her body is reacting like you are abusive when she gets triggered. She might not be 'giving you the cold shoulder' as much as emotionally dissociating as a trauma response. Her body might even feel really cold to her. &it might take something like giving her a big warm hug to trip her out of that mode.\n\nSource: the body keeps the score by bessel van de kolk\n\nThat, or she's using the silenttreatment to punish you, which is problematic. Her treatment of you in public out you at risk and its important that she takes accountability for that", "Nta. She was being wreckless and you didnt know about her verbal triggers", "ESH.\n\nShe was joking in public in a way that kind of compromised you.\n\nAnd you suck because you said \"please use your brain.\" That phrase is kinda mean. You could have just said \"Are you trying to get me jumped? Stop please, people are staring.\" Telling any girl to \"use their brain\" is triggering af because it insinuates we don't.", "NTA\n\nI would only apologize if she did, because she's not guilt free in this either. It sounds like you tried nicely to tell her to stop and she didn't, you didn't know what you said would upset her though.", "NTA. She should have used her brain she could\u2019ve gotten you hurt or worse.", "ESH.  My husband is wi.hite like me and I wouldn't put him in danger by joking like that.  You set a boundary and she didn't follow it.  Let alone joking about something that is super serious for a lot of people.  \n\nYou for the \"use your brain\".  Honestly telling me that would be enough to make you my ex.  No one gets to treat me with that contempt.  We all make mistakes and have poor judgement sometimes.  Treat me like I'm too stupid to think during one of those times is a good way to get me to leave.  I don't need to feel the way I feel when someone says that.", "> she has a verbally abusive father and one of the phrases he would use was \u201cuse your brain\u201d.\n\nESH", "NTA\n\n1.) You didn\u2019t know the history of the phrase to her.\n\n2.) Her behavior has putting your physical safety at risk. \n\n3.) She wasn\u2019t picking up the hints of the danger she was creating. \n\nAll of these created a situation that needed something blunt to be said to grab her attention. Unfortunately, it was a phrase that has a history for her but frankly was likely effective to end the danger she was creating.", "She was being an idiot and in fact should have used her brain. Joking about domestic violence like this is not a joke.\n\nShe allegedly had a \"abusive\" father and joked about you abusing her in public? Tread carefully OP.\n\nSome how she thinks her feelings from alleged past events trump your current feelings.\n\nNTA", "She should\u2019ve apologised to you not the other way round.", "Nta. It would've been better to explain to her why she should stop, but you obviously couldn't because you were panicking. You wanted her to shut up as soon as possible for your own safety", "NTA. Abuse is not something to ever joke about, and especially not something to \u201cjokingly\u201d accuse someone else of in public.", "NTA\n\n\u201cUse your brain\u201d sounds mild as a reaction to what was going on at the time. I do not mean to dismiss or undermine the abuse she suffered by her father\u2026..but you would think someone who has gone through that personally would know better than anyone that *jokingly accusing someone of being abusive loudly in public* is VERY unacceptable. Has she acknowledged her actions and apologized to you about that joke at all yet? If not, I\u2019d be rethinking the relationship. She needs to take responsibility.", "NTA. You were seriously scared for your safety. At least in that moment that\u2019s way more important than her trauma", "NTA. She should have used her brain. Right now she is just pissed that she is wrong and doesnt want to apologize to you. Typical tactic.", "NTA. Her behavior is very odd and she seems unconcerned that she was putting you in physical danger.  I\u2019d have a real big problem with that if I were you.", "NTA you didn't know it was a trigger but she might need some time to process it. While you were worried for your safety she wouldn't have known that instinctively like you would.", "Have you apologized for using the phrase her father used, now that you know?", "NTA, it's an honest mistake and you were concerned for your own safety in the moment. Would be the asshole if you use it again in the future. In the meantime though, try to give her some grace. You unintentionally triggered some heavy stuff, and esp while she is back visiting family it might take a while for her to process and get over that. Some triggers can really throw people back into the worst of their brain states and it takes time to dig yourself back out. \n\nOnce she is feeling better (probably not right after), I think a direct conversation about safety might be necessary. She probably is a bit ignorant to your trouble there and could benefit from some frank explanation. Hell if you both joke around like that a lot consider a \"safe word\" as it were, something that is designated Not A Joke to put a hard stop to the bit, whatever it is. It can be an effective way to make sure to mind everyone's boundaries or triggers in that kind of situation. \n\n\n\n\nThe last piece, much more off the cuff is to maybe consider cutting down on the joke arguing. Doing something like above to make sure real hurt doesn't come out is good, but in my experience folks who do this stuff tend to end up doing it in healthy ways. It becomes an \"I'm just joking\" outlet to real frustrations that don't get resolved because jokes are generally used to deflect the hard conversations instead. It might not be you and I totally get doing it, I used to a lot more but learned my partner doesn't communicate well like that and genuinely would be actually bothered by it. I also realized from watching my sister in her relationship, where they ribbed each other constantly, it wasnt great. They divorced eventually. Every other relationship ive paid attention to since where people do that a lot seems to have a troubled foundation, resentments, or just bad teamwork. Esp coming from an abusive background she may have picked up this kind of ribbing as normal and affectionate, but it might not actually be the healthiest way for her to engage with a partner lovingly.", "He was joking about it too and some people are just naturally loud", "THIS", "Yeah thats where my mind went.  NTA", "I didn\u2019t include it in the post but I asked her to stop a few times and she wasn\u2019t listening. \n\nEither way it\u2019s a phrase I might have used with a male friend in a similar situation. Definitely didn\u2019t mean it in a sexist way.", "Well she wasn't, so...point proven lol", "Did you really just make this about you?", "From the title I thought that was inappropriate to say. Reading the post she put him in very real potential danger of physical harm he would have been justified to say \"shut the fuck up\"\n\nIt's a shame that she has bad history with those words, but at this point he needs to say whatever he can to effectively get her to stop potentially putting his safety in danger.\n\nShe really needed to be using her brain. What she was doing is so obviously dangerous for him. Sucks she had to hear it in the worst way, for real, but that shit isn't acceptable. \n\nI'd personally much rather hear a mean phrase and be able to talk it out later, rather than have my SO carelessly put me in a very realistic position to take a punch to the back of head or get jumped by a gang of drunks.\n\nThe isn't a \"we\" as women type situation, this is about this individuals horrible actions. Seriously would you personally insinuate that you were being abused by your SO in front of people who could be very likely attack as a result of your \"joke?\" That's fucking insane behavior.", "You're talking like _walking on eggshells_ kind of relationship is the default in which the lady can do and say whatever she wants but he gotta be very careful about how he can react to it. \n\nIt was rather mild reaction after she constantly just shrug earlier one's off. He was scared and said what he said. Doesn't make him an asshole.", "Why do people expect rational reaction when someone is scared?\n\nYou want him to think about her feelings when he has to worry about something serious. She hasn't even said sorry yet.\n\nLooking at the situation and her response, she in fact didn't use her brain.", "So you're basically admitting that being in relationship with you would be just walking on eggshells. Right.", "You dumping someone because they say \"to use your brain\"  if you are possibly putting them in danger of physical violence or harm would be a gift to said person.", "Screw that. If someone is putting me in danger I would 100% be mean to them.", "He was also joking about it though, she just continued it. Though she should have stopped when he nicely asked her too.", "Especially if you've suffered from it.\n\nUnless you're callous and/or a cynic about it, which isn't bad in of itself- as long as you don't get enyone else in trouble and then act like it was a targetted attack.", "I could definitely be wrong, but it feels a lot like she may be weaponizing her trauma to avoid responsibility. Because it's odd that she can both joke that OP is abusive but then when he says something that is quite mild because he's in fear for his safety, she's suddenly so traumatized she is shutting him out for days. Maybe the phrase was really just an intense trigger for her, but either way, OP's comment was mild in comparison to what she did to him. OP is NTA either way, because he didn't know the phrase was a trigger and apologized soon after.", "Yes, I apologised as soon as she told me when we were in the taxi. But I\u2019m still receiving the cold shoulder.", "Me three.", "Don't worry, you didn't know.\n\nAt worst, if it was such a common phrase she would have said something beforehand, for which it would have been an AH move on her end- At best, she had the trigger just there and didn't remember it until then.\n\nEither way, NTA. Given the situation she should have had her priorities in order and act upon the possible flaming, and then make her grievances clear to you so it doesn't happen again.\n\nI'd suggest some sort of councelling, be it single or couples therapy to move on.", "Do you have to \"walk on eggshells\" to not insult someone you care about?", "I don\u2019t think he was joking about the abuse\u2026 he said she gave him a bruise, she took it a step further. He immediately noticed a difference in people\u2019s demeanor once she said abuse.", "I had a friend who would do this. Every time I was upset about something she caused, she would wait until I made some slight error and then act mega fucking triggered about it so that I couldn\u2019t defend myself without looking like a bad person. \n\nI\u2019m much better off without that abusive bitch in my life but the scars don\u2019t fade easy", "I believe that could be the case, or a bit of both. Even if this is is genuinely triggering her, she needs to also recognize that she\u2019s acting like a real nut for joking about being abused then use her actual abuse against the very person she joked on. In a way she kind of brought that on herself.", "She needs to get the fuck over it frankly. She caused the situation and now wants to play victim about it. Come on. You apologized and now she needs to own up to her screw up", "Not at all, but if you make multiple insults to another, be ready to get answered the same way. It's pretty manipulative to mock your partner over and over again, and then if the other replied with ONE wrong word, the relationship is over. \n\nTreat the other like you'd like to be treated by one. Or something.", "The only reason i'd be understanding about it here is because he tried to get her to stop nicely and she didn't listen and he felt in danger. I understand his words, though I am typically dead set against insulting your partner."]}
