My parents got divorced when I was 7. \n\nMy mom (50F) met my stepdad \"Rob\" (48M) a few years later, and they dated for 10 years before getting married. Though my parents shared custody, my father (59M) traveled a lot, so I'm much closer to my mother.\n\nRob never tried to replace my dad, but he's been around since I was a kid, and I consider him a second father. Because of that, I am more than comfortable calling him \"Grandpa Rob\" to my baby.\n\nMy dad has dated multiple women since the divorce. While I don't have anything against that, none of his serious relationships last more than a couple of years (usually because of cheating). He's been dating \"Alice\" (34F) for almost two. I met her a few days after I told my family I was expecting.\n\nThroughout my pregnancy, my father would constantly text me about Alice, how much she loved me and how excited she was about the baby. In spite of that, she never tried to get to know me properly. She was aloof whenever I visited my dad, only asked about the baby and questioned me about pretty much anything I did while pregnant. Once I gave birth, she was only interested in seeing me when the baby was around. Still, she's only met him four times.\n\nMe and my fianc\u00e9 visited them this week for my dad's birthday. During our visit, I referred to her as \"Auntie Alice\" to my son. My father questioned me about why Rob gets to be a grandpa, but not Alice. I explained that me and her weren't close, and she didn't seem interested in being in my life, so it didn't make sense for her to be my son's grandma.\n\nMy father said it was unfair that my stepfather got \"special treatment\" while his girlfriend didn't. I stood my ground, but he's been calling and texting me non-stop about how he's disappointed in me, how upset Alice is, and how Rob didn't raise me or pay for anything my entire life. Alice has also called me to say I'm being selfish for not giving her the title she deserves.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is on my side, as well as most of my family, but I can't help but feel like I'm being unfair. I didn't reach out to Alice much either, and maybe I should have tried to welcome her better and get her more involved in my life. I have a rocky relationship with my father, and I really don't want to lose whatever's left of this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684642436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nij1k/aita_for_calling_my_stepdad_my_sons_grandfather/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
