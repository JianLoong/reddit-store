{"id": 891, "submission_id": "yk45el", "title": "WIBTA if I canceled my Birthday Dinner?", "selftext": "  \n\nMy birthday has always been something of a sore spot for me, so I very well may be the asshole here.\n\nMy 30th birthday was on Monday. Growing up, I was always told we cannot celebrate my birthday on my birthday because it\u2019s Halloween, and it would be selfish of me to acknowledge my birthday. Every year, all I have ever wanted was to be able to celebrate with my Family on my birthday, and I\u2019ve expressed this basically every year for the past 10+ years.\n\nIn the couple weeks leading up, my mom and sister kept asking what I wanted to do to celebrate, and kept throwing around different days \u2013 all of the days thrown around were the weekend before, or the weekend after. Eventually, I suggested this upcoming Thursday because my parents and BIL are both off work on Friday, and I took Friday off, so it wouldn\u2019t be a worknight for anyone. Everyone agreed and we made the reservation. \n\nMonday night of this week rolled around, and Husband and I were home with our son (We knew we would be well in advance - our son did not want to go trick-or-treating \u2013 it makes me a little (lot) sad because I\u2019ve been looking forward to Trick or Treating with him since before he was born, but he has no interest in candy and is super shy where it really wouldn\u2019t have been a good experience for him \u2013 we\u2019re really hoping next year he\u2019ll be all jazzed to go).\n\nSo we\u2019re sitting at home watching the movie, and I get a text from my sister\u2026.it\u2019s a picture of the whole family hanging out together.\n\nI never got an invite, and I almost immediately started crying because all I\u2019ve ever wanted was to be able to celebrate with my family on Halloween, and I spent my whole life being told that I\u2019d be selfish for asking that of them. But here they are, all together without me.\n\nWhen I said something to my mom and sister about it, they basically told me I\u2019m an asshole because I never said that I wanted to do something the night of my birthday. I explained that since I\u2019ve always been told it\u2019s not possible, and would be selfish of me, that I didn\u2019t ask. They told me it\u2019s my own fault for not asking and that I can\u2019t just assume, and that I hurt my own feelings and that isn\u2019t their problem.\n\nSo now I\u2019m embarrassed, because it was my fault for not saying I wanted to see them on my birthday and hurting my own feelings. We have dinner scheduled for tomorrow night and I don\u2019t even want to go. I\u2019m still hurt by the fact they all got together on my birthday and didn\u2019t even think to invite me, and I just don\u2019t even want to show my face around them. I already felt like they didn't genuinely want to celebrate anyway, and then all this happened and now I feel like absolute shit for being hurt when it's my own fault. So WIBTA for cancelling my birthday dinner?\n\n\nEdited to add: I really appreciate all your kind words. A lot of people have told me I should spend future birthdays celebrating with friends. Growing up, I wasn't really allowed to have friendships outside of seeing other kids at school, so this is a department I really struggle in. I've got my best friend since middle school, whom I see maybe twice per year. I've had a lot of problems with being taken advantage of, so it's mostly just my husband, son and I. He also has a bad relationship with his family (youngest of 5; his parents stopped trying to be parents once he was born) so we have each other. And we also vow to always make sure our son know how loved he is, especially on his birthday.", "created_utc": 1667392702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yk45el/wibta_if_i_canceled_my_birthday_dinner/", "score": 861, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s about approaching people, establishing connections, finding common ground and having a nice time enjoying something everyone loves. \n\nAlso, signing up your little one for a fun activity: soccer, dance, play group etc. you can meet other parents and have play dates and parent dates too. \nSometimes, you can also meet couples with kids and then having each other over while kids play is fun. \n\nBottom line: You can build your own family with friends too.

You have created your own new, wonderful family with your husband and son. Let your horribly abusive family go. You have a real one, FINALLY. Your \u201cfamily\u201d deserves nothing, all they have given you is pain your whole life. Walk away from them and never look back, keep making a new path with your new family. I know how badly you want your family to treat you like family but it\u2019s been decades and nothing has changed. If your parents treated you so horrible growing up, why would you want them anywhere near your son or family?
