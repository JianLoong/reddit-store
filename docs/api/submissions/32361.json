My husband has a 11yo daughter Kiana and an 8yo son Max (fake names). We have been together for 7 years, married for 6. Our family life is actually quite great, honestly. The adjustment was a bit tough in the beginning for the kids but over the years we have grown and adapted. The one issue that persists is our daughters attitude about getting her own way; I guess would be the best way to describe it.\n\nMy husband and I have full time jobs so to ensure that we still have one on one with the kids and family time, we do a rotation between the kids. On weekends we bring the kids out 1 on 1 for activities of their choosing and on Sunday we do 3 separate family activities of their choosing. So like.. James wants to do bowling and we do that in the morning. Then Kiana wants to go to the movies so we do that in the afternoon and then Max likes board games so we do that after dinner. Every Sunday, as a family. There's never any issues with anyone outside of Kiana. Every single time it's the boys turn to choose an activity, she throws a tantrum because she doesn't want to do it. It's either too boring or she doesn't like that movie or she doesn't like that game, etc. We do not force her to do any of these things. She can do her own thing during the time we have dedicated to the boys activities but she never does. She just sits and pouts and tells us how stupid it is the entire time. \n\nWell, yesterday we went to the aquarium with Max in the morning, went to the arcade in the afternoon with Kiana and then after dinner, James wanted to play skip bo. Kiana immediately started complaining, telling James to pick something else because she doesn't want to play skip bo. We told her no (my husband and I) and that she could go do something else so we could enjoy hanging out with James, just like we enjoyed going to the arcade with her. She stomps off to her room. She comes back 10 minutes later and knocks my deck of cards out of my hands and says \"look\". I look up and she has a toy in her mouth. My husband reprimands her and she immediately starts crying, saying she's tired of us \"never hanging out with her\" (as I said, we do 1 on 1 with her every single weekend AND an activity of her choosing every single Sunday with the family). I told my husband last night that he really needs to rethink therapy (I've brought it up before and he said no because it's her choice to make, not his, and she doesn't want to). He was immediately down my throat saying he's tired of me trying to force therapy for his daughter and making out like she's \"broken\".", "created_utc": 1701722305, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18atoqz/aita_for_trying_to_force_my_step_daughter_in_to/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Until then you decide what\u2019s best for her.", "NTA - Your stepdaughter needs to learn coping mechanisms to deal with sharing parental attention with her brothers. It doesn't necessarily need to happen in a therapeutic setting, but working with a psychiatric professional who specializes in teenagers (and especially teenage girls) would likely be super helpful. \n\nA lot of commenters are just calling Kiana a brat, which I don't *love* (though I understand why) - the thing with \"bratty\" behavior is that it's not necessarily malicious, especially coming from an eleven year old. She has no real experience in identifying her needs and advocating for them healthily. She's being eaten alive by a billion new feelings all the time - poor girl is hitting puberty!! - and of course she doesn't know wtf to do with them. \n\nI'm also not surprised Kiana's demanding some attention and priority right now. She's the middle child, the only girl, AND the family is blended. I can imagine a VAST array of difficult and painful emotions that could come from that. Maybe she's feeling insecure, like she can't compete with your bio-son and therefore resents the times he gets attention or priority. Maybe she feels like her brothers have her outnumbered so she's constantly doing stuff only they like. Maybe she has no idea why she's feeling ignored and unimportant, because it's irrational anxiety and she isn't emotionally mature enough yet to figure that out!!\n\nWhen you're dealing with big emotions that don't make sense in context, and for which you cannot determine the logic, I find it really helpful to identify what  the reactive behaviors are causing. In this context, her tantrums cause her to not have to participate, bring the mood down for her brothers' activities, and reorients her parents' attention to her. Translated: she doesn't want to do what they want and she doesn't want to be left out, so instead she ruins it for everyone else to try to stop it altogether. It's selfish behavior, yes, but it's coming from an understandable emotional place: she wants to feel welcomed and included and special within her family unit. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, I have a few suggestions:\n\n1. Special Girl Time to do Special Girl Things. (With a correlating \"boring boy time to do boring boy things\") Kiana is telling you she feels like she's not getting enough time and attention - regardless of whether this is true, it's how she truly feels. Especially as she gets older and takes in more cultural information about stepmothers, she may grow insecure about your love for her. Building a special connection between just the two of you can help counter that, and make sure she feels confident in her relationship with you. Take her for pedicures or to \"girly\" stores, have spa days where you do face masks together, watch feminist movies and eat junk food! Let her feel like she's getting something special and precious with you.\n\n2. Practice coping strategies and empathy. Privately - i.e., away from her brothers, maybe in her room, maybe at a therapist's office - help her talk through what emotions are sparking these tantrums and help her build that mind-body connection, and from there an empathetic connection. Questions like \"how would you feel if Max tried to veto the arcade?\" can prompt her to think beyond just her wants and needs. \n\n3. Set boundaries, and communicate the consequences of violating those boundaries in advance. The fact that Kiana doesn't HAVE to participate in her brothers' activities isn't preventing her tantrums (I suspect it's a FOMO problem), so lay out her options clearly. She can participate without whining, and leave if she gets too bored. If she does whine or throw a tantrum, she's *no longer allowed to participate*, and has to go to timeout in her room for X amount of time. If she doesn't want to participate in the activity, she can stay at the table and play on a console/read a book/draw/similar solo activities as long as she isn't disruptive or rude. If she does disrupt, return to the timeout consequence. Right now, she has incentive to throw a tantrum, right? Tantrum = diverting attention to her + taking away fun from her brothers. You need to take that incentive away. If she throws a tantrum, one parent stands up from the activity, walks her to her room, and leaves her in there with a timer and a book. No yelling at her, no big emotional fight, no *attention.* Her brothers get to keep having fun without her. \n\nRe: your husband, I definitely am side-eyeing his negative reaction to therapy. I hope once tensions have lessened, you can both come back to the discussion with open minds and decide when and how you would pursue therapy for any of your kids. As many other commenters noted, people in therapy aren't broken. They're working with a skilled professional to improve their emotional intelligence, endurance, and skills. That's laudable, not embarrassing or shameful. \n\n(Apologies for the wall of text, and I hope you and your family enjoy the holiday season!)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And yet, it\u2019s on him that\u2014out of his experience\u2014he has not taught his daughter how to ask for help or get the support she needs by making it readily available and easily accessible. His attitude towards therapy is a barrier for her getting her needs met. He\u2019s projecting brokenness onto her, but that\u2019s about him and is, unfortunately, evidence that he would in fact greatly benefit from therapy. He has taken a childhood experience and written off an entire discipline that is full of rich resources, and as someone who also had childhood trauma: *that is how patterns repeat generationally.* \n\nIt\u2019s not a failure of parenting for your kids to need more than you. It\u2019s a failure of parenting to act as a barrier to possible support so that our egos and fears are protected. Kiana, at 11, needs some help with emotional regulation and articulating her needs. What a gift it would be to give her that!\n\nI hear love and compassion on both of your parts toward her, which is refreshing. So many parents make a child with behavioral issues into a family scapegoat, when usually they are either the only ones telling truths or they need some extra love and support for a while.", "lol so why come on here if u are not prepared to hear what others have to say based on your pollyana post?", "People who are fine until they don't get what they want usually have problems regulating their emotions. Therapy can teach techniques for doing so, as well as help children learn empathy and other important aspects of emotional intelligence. Social workers often use the term \"tool box\" to describe how we deal with our emotions. If someone has a limited tool box, they do not have the tools they need to handle negative emotions, so they rely on what they do have--outbursts, hurtful words, etc. Discipline can help children understand right from wrong, but it cannot necessarily help them build their tool box. If the parents do not know how to increase a child's tools, then therapy may also help.", "It is likely a combination of both. There could be something else behind the emotions (aside from her not getting her way) that is causing her to act out. For an example if there is a shared parenting plan then maybe there is an issue in the other home, or at school, and she is acting out at her father\u2019s because she feels safe there. If the bio mom isn\u2019t in the picture she might be dealing with  insecurities or abandonment issues , especially since she is in pre-puberty which is when a lot of girls rely on mom. Therapy can help get to the root cause and give her the tools to handle these big emotions properly."]}
