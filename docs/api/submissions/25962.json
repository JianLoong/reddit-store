Everything was fine until I was in line at the register. There was a pregnant lady in front of me with a young boy, I would guess around 3 or 4. She was talking to the cashier and looking back at her food on the conveyer belt. That's when she turned around to me and asked, \"Sir, could you please help me with my groceries today?\" \n\nI took a quick glance at how much she had on the conveyer and asked her how much she needed. She told me 47 dollars. I know it sounds shitty but I told her no. She seemed surprised by my answer. She asked me again I guess hoping I would change my answer but I still said no.\n\nShe looked annoyed and told me, \"Why are you saying no? You clearly don't lack the money, \" while pointing to the lego set in my hands. I couldn't believe she had the audacity to say that.\n\nThe box was a decent size so she must've assumed it was worth a lot but it was only $110. I'm not rich by any means, but I do have some spending cash whenever I want a new set. I wasn't just going to waste nearly $50 of my money on a random stranger.\n\nHer comment started to anger me but that's when the little boy came up to me and asked me why I wasn't helping his mommy. She jumped on the oppurtunity and started pleading, \"Please sir, my foodstamps ran out, I really need this food for my family. You wouldn't let us starve would you?\" \n\nAt this point I knew she was just straight up lying and trying to use me for free money. All the stuff on the conveyer was junk food. Chips, cookies, soda, etc. Why would she waste her foodstamps on that if she knew it was going to run out? Besides, she already had stuff in her cart, so she wasn't \"going to starve\" as she said. \n\nI know I shouldn't have said this next part, but this whole situation was making me pissed. I looked at her and said, \"You should keep your legs closed if you can't afford to have kids.\" Her jaw dropped in shock. I turned around and left towards the self checkout line before she could say anything. \n\nI know I should've gone to self checkout to begin with but the lines weren't long so I thought ' it wont matter' , but I could've avoided this whole thing. When I got home I told my boyfriend about everything, but he said I was an asshole. We argued for a bit before dropping it. So, am I the asshole for not paying her bill?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I always told myself, after growing up poor, I would never put my own kids through what I went through, and I would be able to support a family before having one. \n\nI have no problem with having a social net, but the way government aid programs are set up and regulated these days is ridiculous. Fraud is rampant, no real oversight, no incentives to improve one's situation, just have another baby and up the aid amount.
