We broke up before he moved and I know he suggested Sirius live with me partly out of guilt as his family could\u2019ve easily taken him in. \n\nDuring the 3 years my boyfriend would regularly visit Sirius whenever he was home and he gave me money to cover all of his expenses. Since he was visiting so much to see Sirius we eventually got back together and my boyfriend is in the process of moving back home. Now the big issue is he wants Sirius to live with him but I\u2019ve grown attached to Sirius and I love him so much that I don\u2019t want to give him back even though this was never supposed to be a permanent thing. I\u2019ve never had a pet before so the idea of giving Sirius up is devastating even though I know I can see him anytime I want. I\u2019ve grown used to having him around and it\u2019ll be lonely without him.\n\nMy boyfriend said Sirius is still his dog and that I can visit him all of the time but it\u2019s not the same. We\u2019ve been arguing over Sirius a lot and his only compromise is that I should live with him so everybody wins but I don\u2019t think our relationship is there yet even though we\u2019ve lived together in the past (things were different then).\n\nWIBTA If I don\u2019t let my bf take Sirius?", "created_utc": 1702325673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18g2yli/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_boyfriend_his_dog/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he\u2019s been footing the bill for all the stuff this entire time, you have zero rights to the dog. You aren\u2019t required to move in with your boyfriend, but you also don\u2019t get to keep the dog if he wants him back.", "YTA simply because you accepted the money for the expenses over those 3 years, which means you were not taking ownership of all the dog responsibilities beyond being a very long term dog boarder.", "I\u2019m going with a soft YTA. From your description, it doesn\u2019t sound like he re-homed the dog with you. He was visiting the dog and paying you for the dog\u2019s expenses. It\u2019s natural that you love the dog, but it sounds like you were just providing care while the owner was gone.", "YTA. I know you love this dog. But he is not yours. You knew it since the start and your bf have been very, very involved with the dog all along, leaving you zero reasons to think the dog is yours. \n\nYou need to give it back.", "YTA\nYou had an agreement. He paid for his necessity. He visited regularly. There was ALWAYS the understanding he would have got the dog back. Give the dog back!", "Does this even need to be asked? Probably the most cut and dry YTA I\u2019ve ever seen. Give the dog back", "YWBTA YTA\n\nThat is not your dog. You have been kind enough to let him stay with you, but it's clear he was never abandoned by his actual owner.", "I'm going to go with a \"soft\" YTA. I say that because \"asshole\" isn't the right word here, you're not that. I understand you'd be upset to no longer have Sirius living with you. It's so easy to get attached to a pet and 3 years is a long time, so it will no doubt be hard to give him back. But ultimately, it is your boyfriend's dog and you were very kind to take him in while your BF went abroad and couldn't take Sirius himself.", "YWBTA If it was never meant to be a permanent thing and he's been paying for all of his expenses, Sirus should go back to your boyfriend. It's a crappy situation, but it's the right thing to do.", "YTA\n\nYou made an agreement. Honor it. It's that simple. Be a person of your word ffs.", "YTA You know it\u2019s not your dog. I understand your pain and love for the dog, but imagine how your boyfriend feels. It\u2019s his dog and your are refusing to give it back to him. Honestly, if my boyfriend refused to give me back my dog i would be livid and that would be grounds to break up.", "OK, so, here's the thing: you're the one telling us all of this, so supposedly this is the best version of this story for you.\n\nAnd yet...\n\nYour BF, from what you yourself acknowledge, never stopped being the best possible owner given the circumstances.\n\nWhat possible reason would justify you keeping what is essentially his property by law? (assuming the law works roughly the same where you live than where I live). \n\nI get that you're attached, but again, from what you wrote it sounds like you provided long-term boarding services. \n\nSure, it isn't completely fair because it definitely sounds like you invested something in all of this (your feelings and care) but I'm afraid that not enough compared to what he invested (his actually money on top of his feelings and his care).\n\nYWBTA", "YTA unfortunately - you did a wonderfully kind thing here but ultimately its still his dog.", "YWBTA. Who owns the dog depends on the terms upon which he gave the dog to you. You say it was never supposed to be a permanent thing, so it's his dog.\n\nThere are a lot of really sweet dogs out there who will be put down if nobody adopts them.", "I wouldn't say you're an \"AH\" for loving and caring for Sirius and having hesitation to just let him go, here it comes... *but*, Sirius is his dog and your BF funded Sirius's entire stay with you.. Find a compromise that is comfortable for you both.", "Sorry, but it was never your dog, you were just a dog landlord.\n\nYTA, give the man back his dog.", "You're trying to renege on your original agreement and you can't just decide to keep the dog, it's HIS DOG. YTA although maybe a soft one....", "YTA He isn't yours, you knew this from the start, and your ex boyfriend paid for his keep. He didn't dump and leave him, he wanted to give you some company while he was away. Give him his dog back and go adopt a dog near you. There are many desperate for a nice warm home.", "YTA", "In the nicest way possible YTA it\u2019s his dog but it seems like it was misunderstanding with the relationship but have you ever considered getting your own dog? It would give Sirius a friend to play with when you vist your bf but you won\u2019t be lonely", "YWBTA. After all. It is still HIS dog. Even if you cared for it. He still payed for everything related to the dog, and came to visit to play with him and to see him. The right decision is to give him back", "YTA. You admit it was never supposed to permanent,  so weekdays the question? Adulting is hard.", "Yes YWBTAH - Unfortunately, you have to give him the dog back. That's the agreement that was made and he has continued to pay his expenses and visited on a regular basis. If he had abandoned the dog, it would be a different story.", "YWBTA you can't just steal someones dog. that is ridiculous.", "YTA. Light judgement, just enough to make you do the right thing. Your feeling are understandable, maybe start at 50/50, do sleepovers, stop by for walks on days you're missing the pup. The agreement was that you were watching HIS dog. It's Ok to be sad, upset", "Your reasons are you'd be lonely without him and you're used to having him around. Get a different dog. If you'd have been like I love this dog so much, he's my best friend etc etc I'd have understood but it's his dog, he clearly does love him and I think you should give him back in this scenario. NAH or maybe a soft yta", "YWBTA I\u2019m afraid, but I totally understand why. Pets are amazing and lovely and just make your day so much better. Which is why your boyfriend wants home back. Hopefully your relationship will move forward and one day you end up living together. Then you\u2019ll be back with the two men you love most. But for now, Sirius has to go back to your boyfriend.", "NTA.  So he paid for food, etc.  Did he pay boarding fees?  I'd really reconsider this relationship.", "Strangely enough, when items are left behind after 30 days they belong to the person they were left with, including pets. But I have been known to be wrong....just don't beat me up about my own admission.", "ESH - I am so sick of some comments here. A dog is not a thing you can move around. It doesn\u2019t matter how much money he or she or whoever gave for that dog no matter over how much time. \n\nOP ask yourself what is best for the dog. Who has more time to care for this dog? Garden? Time and discipline for walks? Is the dog attached to your boyfriend or you? Providing food? Make a list and decide based on the dog\u2019s needs. If you and your boyfriend really love this dog, please (both of you) be fair!", "\"Since he was visiting so much to see Sirius we eventually got back together\"\n\nHis ploy worked, he kept ties with you via the dog, he was able to date whomever he wanted while overseas for 3 years, it kept you from really establishing any relationships of your own, and now that he's moving back, he wants his dog back to keep you in his life.  Very manipulative AH, if you ask me.\n\nNTA to tell him to F off.  He abandoned the dog. It's yours now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There are plenty of adult dogs in shelters that need a home.", "You were basically fostering his dog until he could return. You must return his dog. If you steal his dog he could take legal action. Yes you got attached but you knew the deal. It wasn't like he dumped all responsibility on you. He paid for his care and he made a point to return to visit his beloved pup. You would definitely be an AH if you tried to keep his dog just because you got attached. Go to a shelter and rescue a pup of your own. Help a pup in need and the pup will give you unconditional love in return.", "Soft YTA.", "YWBTA. He didn\u2019t give the dog to you, it\u2019s not your dog.

Time to get your own doggie.", "YTA, This wasn't like he abandoned Sirrus and just moved away and left you to take care of him. He's been footing the bill and coming back for regular visits. Either give him back his dog or move in or get your own pet.", "Soft YTA. It's understandable that you love and don't want to lose Sirius but you said yourself that this was never meant to be a permanent arrangement and it was essentially just an extended pet-sitting job. It's not a case of 'letting' your boyfriend take Sirius; Sirius is his dog, not yours, meaning it ultimately isn't up to you and your boyfriend has every right to take him back without your permission.", "YTA . In your own words you\u2019ve taken his money to pay for the dogs expenses and have always understood you taking care of Sirius would not be a permanent thing. I get that it will suck, and you will miss him. But he\u2019s not your dog. \n\nHonor your agreement and if you really miss having a pet around, you could always consider getting your own dog.", "It's his dog. Give the dog back. Get a new dog.", "How is it a misunderstanding? OP is fully cognizant of the fact that they were being paid to board the dog. They knew the boyfriend was not giving the dog to OP. There is no misunderstanding.", "The dog was not left behind. He\u2019s been paying for all expenses this entire time, and has been to visit. He\u2019s essentially paying for his dog to be boarded, simply by someone he knows and not a professional. In no way is this the same as someone leaving something with a person then never discussing it or paying for it to be stored again.", "In certain instances I would agree but by OP's own admission he was still paying for and regularly visiting the dog so it wasn't \"Abandoned\" \n\nThat would be like if you rented a storage unit for 6 months but didn't go by for 30 days.  It doesn't mean the storage company know owns all of your stuff.", "Woah buddy I think you have been on reddit for too long. This little scenario you just invented seems like deep parano\u00efa.\n\nNothing in OP's post point toward him doing all that so he can sleep with other people and keep OP under his control. That's wild.", "He\u2019s paid for all the expenses. It\u2019s absolutely not OP\u2019s dog.", "Wow.

Always better to offer perspective than to try and tear someone down for not knowing something.", "I... cannot prove something that is not there. The burden of the proof is on the shoulder of the one make the claim.", "Okay let's play by your logic.  \n\nNothing in the post even suggests that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProve me wrong.", "He can and he\u2019ll win. Pets are considered possessions in terms of the law. If he\u2019s been footing the bill this whole time, he\u2019s the legal owner.", "Ty!! Sorry I don\u2019t use Reddit much", "Nope.
