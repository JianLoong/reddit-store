She said the clothes are in great condition and great quality.   That doesn't sound like he is trying to deny his child clothing, it sounds more like she is overspending what he considers reasonable.  It makes complete sense that she should sell the used clothing to help keep that spending in check.  She is in no way an AH for spending how she does and the husband does not sound like he's the AH either.

You warned her, though,  and she ignored you.", "I will ignore the possibility of financial abuse from your husband because I don\u2019t have sufficient information about the budgetary decisions you and your husband have together. However, I have the perfect answer to the baby clothing issue.\n\nYour sister can give you money to buy baby clothes. After your son outgrows them, her son wears them.

I give away things from carters or her gifts after she's worn them but I hold on the the expensive clothes to resell and use it to buy new clothes too. There's no reason to give it away when they are only a few months apart. I would just say he still fits into the size she's expecting. It'll be a better excuse when he starts wearing 2t because toddler sizes fit them for a year if not longer. \n\nIf someone was demanding free clothes from me I might seek some free or cheap stuff from marketplace or a garage sale (using 0.50 a piece) and give that and keep my good clothes. There's options besides causing a rift over clothes. By the way they're assholes not you but if you wanted to keep the peace you have a few options.

It's simple free enterprise, that a lot of people don't even consider by either holding onto the ones that don't fit or will just throw them into a landfill.  Your sister is in the wrong for holding onto the ones that she didn't give back or bother reimbursing you for them, and you should probably just close that door for the future and keep doing what you're doing.", "NTA. Baby clothes are expensive and if you can sell them to buy the next sizes that is great. If SIL and MIL have a problem with it, tell them to take it up with your husband since he has you on a strict budget. That seems a bit controlling, but then budgets are needed. Anyway, SIL lost her borrowing privileges when she didn\u2019t return the first batch which was the clearly stated expectation from the beginning.

OP is making do with very little.\n\nFor example with the cost of adult clothing and footwear also coming out of the $500 per month, how did OP afford maternity clothing, and how does she afford post-baby clothing? Does OP perhaps sell her old clothing, too?\n\nDoes OP have a babysitter or daycare budget so she can continue her nursing studies?\n\nSeveral of my contemporaries also made sure to pay into the mother's retirement fund while she was a SAHM.

He very well could be the AH for that but it really depends on their circumstances.  I freely admit that I tend to read the comments saying or implying that anyone is being financially abused with not just a grain of salt, but a whole shaker full.  I don't think many of the folks making those comments understand that there are many ways for finances to be determined that are fair but not necessarily equal.  I don't think those types of comments belong in posts that aren't asking that question.", "So it\u2019s an overall budget and not different budgets for different areas I.e clothing budget, food budget etc.  \n\nThat makes a difference.  You need to have a discussion with your husband about that.  But also what I said holds true - you have to sell the clothes to buy new - so she has two options - buy clothes from you or buy them from a store", "A $500 a month fun budget is more than most people working full time have.", "That seems like a lot.  How much are you spending on fun stuff for yourself? And why would you need 100s per month on baby clothes? i think you should track your spending.", "Well is OP buying $4 items from Target or $50 Ralph Lauren onesies?

I\u2019m not arguing they should exactly the same discretionary spending numbers, I\u2019m arguing that she should get a say in the budget and that his refusal to do so and OP comments that it\u2019s only gotten worse with marriage are cause for concern.", "Giving her a $500 a month fun budget isn\u2019t refusing to clothe his child.", "I mean, do *you* think the budget makes sense?

The clothes get destroyed at daycare, and we can save the money on more important things for the kiddos. Try the thrift stores. They have tones of good deals and cloths still with the tags.", "If the non-earner spends his money willy nilly, then he very much should set a budget for her.\n\nYou sound like an entitled stay at home semi-mother.", "Female here. Also a single parent for reference.\n\nI completely disagree with this. \n\nIf both parents have agreed that one should stay at home and raise kids then there absolutely has to be a budget. Unless you\u2019re extremely well off, most regular households will struggle with just one wage if not managed correctly.\n\nIf OP doesn\u2019t feel she\u2019s getting enough money being a stay at home parent then she needs to go get a job and put the kids into Creche", "You're making stuff up again.

My dad did not enjoy the chore of managing the budget, so, though he was the one who worked, my mother set the budget with his happy blessing.  Shared or delegated responsibility is not the same as one person acting as the family dictator.", "It\u2019s not \u201chis\u201c money. It\u2019s their money.

The earner and homemaker are partners in creating and managing the household.", "Disagree with what? I\u2019m paraphrasing OPs own statements about the degree to which her husband allows her input on their family finances.\n\nThe idea that he is the only one who can \u201ccorrectly manage\u201d the household finances and she has to just accept what he has deemed is an acceptable number is what is wrong, unless she has proven she\u2019s not got strong financial management skills. And to be clear, buying more baby clothes than your husband thinks is necessary is not indicative of having poor financial management skills.", "Okay. I\u2019ll just let all of OP words speak for themselves. \n\nShe\u2019s gets $500 a month for both baby clothes and anything she needs for herself that aren\u2019t groceries. Her husband makes $2500 a week, or $10,000 a month. Meaning she has access to 5% of their household budget and he has access to a significantly larger percentage after they pay their bills.", "If only women had a way to make money, too. It's as if the world is full of opportunities and people could try to communicate so they can have meaningful relationships, or something!", "Well, that's a bit of a big set of assumptions.  If it's 10k gross, that's really about 7500 after taxes.  Take out a mortgage, say 2500, and car payments, phones, utilities, groceries, insurance, other bills, the 250 is significantly more than 5% of discretionary spending for the family", "It's telling that you're intentionally giving her numbers as net and the households as gross. You don't mention taxes. You have no clue what their bills are. Rent or mortgage? Car/s? Food? Health insurance? Cost of recently having a baby?!?!\n\nYou're obviously a laze at home woman who bullies her husband, because you have no idea how finances actually work.", "Presumably, one of those things people communicate about is whether one of them will be staying at home with the kids rather than earning. I would certainly hope they are communicating about that.\n\nAnd, again, what does making money have to do with whether someone should have a say in the household budget? It\u2019s a bit sad that you can\u2019t seem to conceive of treating a stay at home parent as an equal partner."]}
