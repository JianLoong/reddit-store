I have a similar problem as OP where I love buying cute things for my kid all the time but you can\u2019t do that unless you\u2019re rich.", "500$ fun + baby clothes budget is less? Haha. What do you want then? For him to deposit his entire paycheck to your account directly?", "50 pieces, not 50 pairs. That\u2019s like 1-2 weeks of baby clothes if you\u2019re changing your child once a day.", "She\u2019s not spending $500 a month on baby clothes. $500 a month is for anything she needs for herself outside of groceries, plus clothes for the baby. \n\nAnd again, it\u2019s not really about the exact number. Nothing in this post indicates that she has a spending problem beyond what her husband says. 50 pieces of baby clothing is like a week or two of clothes if your child gets sick on themselves and you need to change them once a day.", "Because the inequality gives you more power in the relationship which introduces a corrosive relationship dynamic. Do you want a partner or a servant with a permanent lever over their head who will push comes to shove have to suck up to you?\n\nIf you're not willing to go roughly half with your partner from your combined incomes, then marry someone who makes a similar amount of money as you. If you *don't*, if you say married someone who \"had fun\" while you were studying/working, on the face of it just because it happened, one can assume there's a good reason for that i.e. your partner contributes something else in a way you don't or their market competition didn't while you were searching for a good match. \n\nIf your partner is better looking than average/than you, if they're high in general intelligence and/or emotional intelligence, if they're good at running a household and/or dealing with children in a way you're not, that's your tradeoff. If there's nothing to trade off, either objectively or in your perception, then you made a poor match.", "OP what are you and your husband\u2019s ages? How old were you when you met? Did you finish high school, college or a trade program? Have you ever had your own job or lived on your own? Has he ever denied you money for something you think is a necessity? Do you have your own savings account? Are you in contact with family? Do you see your friends? You have me concerned", "Well, you were wrong.  Look at other replies in this thread by OP.", "if the clothes come out of her 'fun budget' then she's totally in the right to not hand them over to her SIL for free. i don't know if she has a seperate budget to buy stuff for the baby, but baby care stuff isn't 'fun budget' stuff", "I'd agree-to a point. A general \"she should get a say\" in it, I would still have reservations about.  I know several people who are highly intelligent, but when it comes to anything related to money, they are complete morons.  Not saying this is what's happening, but, for example, if her input consists of a $5k/monthly expenditure on clothing, I would back him up on a hard no.  Again, I would go with it depending on their circumstances.  To say that she should have a say assumes she's reasonable and responsible.  I'm not assuming that.", "I am under the impression they are onesies, so I\u2019m thinking 25 days worth assuming they are gonna vomit regularly.", "wtf do you put on your baby that you need 50 pieces for a week? Do you get pregnant with onions or why does your baby need that many layers?\n\na onesie, a pair of tights and a shirt, done. that's 3 items. Add the fact that WASHING MACHINES exist and you'll need no more than 30 items at best. That's 10 days worth of daily clothes changes. Given that you'll want to wash the puked on baby clothes quickly since baby puke starts to smell really bad quickly you'll probably wash the clothes every 4 or 5 days. \n\nBuying 50 pieces is already unneccessary many, especially since babies grow out of them after the third rotation of 30 pieces.", "I mean maybe. Or not. That\u2019s still not that excessive to me. More than I would personally spend, but definitely not \u201ccut my partner entirely from contributing her input to our family budget\u201d level of egregious.", "Sure, it might be. She\u2019s still not allowed input on her \u201cbudget\u201d and he approach is take or leave it. I\u2019m not arguing that $500 is in and of itself insufficient. I\u2019m arguing that his refusal to let her jointly manage the finances is a red flag, especially if his discretionary spending budget is substantially higher.", "Team work makes the dream work. We both keep each other in harmony on our budgeting.", "It\u2019s extremely wasteful to me especially if they are going to be used for less than a year. It just seems like a waste of money", "The person who has to get up early every morning and go work 40+ hours per week and earn enough to keep a household afloat is absolutely entitled to have more input into family finances than the person that stays at home and doesn\u2019t work.\n\nIf the parent staying at home is unhappy with this, there are plenty of jobs around - no excuse", "Okay cool. And the fact that she is giving or selling them to other person so they\u2019re being reused means nothing, got it. And you think that what you\u2019ve determined waste means OP should have zero say in her household budget. So awesome. Very sensible and not at all and weird opinion.", "Given that you\u2019re a stay at home single mother I assume you\u2019re aware that stay at home parents, especially those of babies and toddlers, also get up early every day and provide labour for their home in excess of 40 hours a week right? \n\nAlso, given that you used the word cr\u00e8che I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re from a country worth relatively affordable childcare - as someone who grew up in a country that called it \u201ccr\u00e8che\u201d and is aware of the cost of said childcare. Are you aware that in lots of places in the world, a stay at home parent\u2019s potential earnings is less or about equal to the cost of childcare. That\u2019s why so many choose to stay at home. \n\nAnd finally, OP says she\u2019s in nursing school right now so that she *can* start working and contributing salary to the household. What do you want her to do, create more hours in the day to also work on top of caring for an infant full time and going to school or time travel 5 years into the future when she\u2019s graduated and has job offer?", "I mean, if you\u2019re just being a misogynist then I think this conversation is over. Enjoy yelling into the void loser.", "No she only started selling so she could buy more. She is bad with money so she was given a budget. The fact that she married him gives me the impression he isn\u2019t simply controlling her way of life. \n\nI know people who make the all the income in the house but has their spouse control the finances because they are bad with money. People who aren\u2019t frugal need a budget, some recognize it and allow their partner to manage the money.", "Feminism has ruined me, I guess.", "At no point did I say I was a stay at home parent. Thanks for assuming though \ud83d\udc4c\n\nI work full time, 40+ hours per week and always have - even while in a 2 parent household I have always worked, because I would never rely on someone else to provide for me when I can provide for myself. \n\nI happen to be from a country where Creche fees are astronomical (thanks again for assuming you know where I\u2019m from) but in a 2 parent working wage household, the combined family income still outweighs the Creche fees unless you have 4 kids under pre school age.", "\"You used math when discussing budgets. mYs0GyNy!1!1\""]}
