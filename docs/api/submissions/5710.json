They\u2019re both super into princesses and all that. We\u2019ve talked about taking them to Disney over the next few years as we know they\u2019d love it. My wife has never been before, and I\u2019ve only been once- when I was 10 years old. It was definitely a memorable trip for me as my family had to save up a while for it. We\u2019ve always known that Disney would be our big trip with our girls.\n\nIn July, my FIL got diagnosed with prostate cancer. After a few rounds of chemo and some rather intense stays at the hospital, it\u2019s only gotten worse. It\u2019s spread across to other organs in his body, and rather than trying to suffer to fight it, he\u2019s opted to just not do chemo and try to live with what time he has left. As a result, him and my MIL have decided to make more memories with family. One of these memories is to take our daughters to Disney & surprised them with the trip yesterday during Christmas.\n\nAt first, I thought my wife would be against it as well- we\u2019ve always said we\u2019ve wanted to get to experience taking them and seeing their faces. However, I found out that my MIL cleared it with my wife last month. My wife didn\u2019t tell me because she thought I would be surprised and excited for our daughters. I sat through all of the rest of the night, but when we got home we had a serious discussion about it.\n\nI told my wife that I didn\u2019t want our daughters first trip to Disney to be without us. She suggested we go along, but the trip is in February, and booking flights+hotel+tickets for just my wife and I for the time they\u2019re all going is still going to be almost $5000. I told my wife that we have to talk to her parents & decline the trip, but my wife is saying that I\u2019m being selfish and heartless by robbing our daughters of this experience & robbing them of a core memory with my FIL before he passes. Am I being out of line here?", "created_utc": 1672084228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvv77q/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_in_laws_taking_our_kids/", "score": 12020, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife is right. I understand your disappointment in not being the first to take your kids to Disney, but these are special circumstance. Their grandfather/your wife's father is dying and wants to create memories with his grandchildren that will last once he is gone. It's small minded and selfish to take that opportunity away from him and your children just so you can be the first to have the experience with them. Do you think if you do this your wife and daughter's won't resent you for what you are taking away from them to satisfy your own selfish need. If you do this remember someday your daughter's will be adults and think about how they will look back on this and what they will think about you.", "YTA. Don\u2019t take this incredibly thoughtful and meaningful gift away from your children, especially when it is a chance to create some core memories with a grandfather who doesn\u2019t have much longer to live. Take it from someone whose grandfather also died when I was young, these are the kinds of memories they will cherish. \n\nIt would be incredibly selfish to take this away from your children, and also from your wife - this is her father who is dying and she probably wants this for your kids more than you know. \n\nEither figure out how to make this trip work, or take them again when you can afford it. Guaranteed they will love a return trip, and likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten to see all of it the first time, so it will still be a magical experience", "Okay, I\u2019m going against the tide here, but I can\u2019t see an easy judgement. Your in-laws are not TA. They asked and were granted the opportunity. I can actually see your perspective - I would want to be there to experience my child\u2019s first trip to Disney too. However, you and your wife have exhibited poor judgment. She ABSOLUTELY should not have agreed to this without your input, that is not acceptable. My only thought is that she\u2019s too focused on making her father\u2019s last days joyful to consider all angles. You have been presented with a tough situation, but are more focused on your own feelings than those of everyone involved. The problem is, your in-laws and children are blameless in this, and it will not go well for you to yank this opportunity out from under them. However, I would like to point out another issue - have they really thought this through? They\u2019re two people of somewhat advanced age, one of whom has terminal cancer and is doing chemo, and they want to chase two insanely hyped up young children around Disney for however long?! You and your wife really need to try to find a way to go, because I don\u2019t see that ending well for them!", "YTA, drive to florida if you want to be there.", "That grandparent has a very limited time....", "YTA- big time. That is extremely selfish of you.", "Probably unpopular opinion: ESH. \n\nYou are reacting poorly. I get that this is a memory that you want to be able to make with your children and for it to be a once in a lifetime first. \n\nYour wife and in laws absolutely should not have hid this from you. Yes he has limited time, that is not a reason to cut you out of parenting decisions.\n\nETA: OP asked for your opinion, not me. Don\u2019t DM me it\u2019s annoying and inappropriate. I\u2019m not debating with anyone here or privately.", "YTA. \n\nCome on man....give a dying man and his wife a great memory. You could always take your kids another time.", "YTA.  Vetoing the gift of some final memories about their grandfather to your children because you want to go is selfish beyond belief.", "YTA. I understand some people see Disney World as some sort of \u201cMilestone\u201d in family travel but in all reality, it\u2019s just a theme park. Your FIL is going to pass soon, wouldn\u2019t you want your daughters to remember him as \u201cThe most awesome grandpa who took us to Disney World\u201d when he passes? You are taking away a potential memory not only from your daughter but from your dying FIL. You should be over the moon that someone wants to pay to take your kids somewhere that expensive.", "Yes you are out of line.  I had a trip to Disney planned for my family including my parents when mom was diagnosed with cancer. She was so upset at the thought of missing the trip because she had gone with all the other grands and thought she was going to miss it with my youngest. She made the trip and it was our last big family vacation since my mom and husband died a couple of years later. Take the time, spend the money, make the memories. It's worth the sacrifices.  Don't be an AH.", "YTA. Your FIL is trying to make a special memory with his granddaughters before he passes away. Your wanting to be with them for their first Disney trip is not nearly as important as his last few months of life. Suck it up and let them have fun with their grandkids.", "YTA it isn\u2019t about you, you are beyond selfish.  I pity your family", "YTA. \n\nEither suck up the cost and go or let them go. Your FIL is dying for fucks sake", "Seems like opinions are all over and I'm voting NTA.  You don't say how far but I wouldn't let my kids at that age go without one parent.", "YTA. If grandpa weren't sick, I MIGHT side with you. I completely understand that a trip to Disney is expensive, we can't afford to take our kids, and my 5 yo loves the princesses. But Grandpa won't be around for much longer. Give him and your children this memory.  I went to Disney with my grandparents and it's one of my favorite memories with my grandpa. If I went with my parents it wouldn't rank in my top 10 favorite memories. \n\nSide story, my sister took her kids a couple years ago and when they got back they said it was fun, but they would have had more fun at a water park. \n\nI understand what you are feeling, but let your kids have this memory.", "If you are that worried about firsts then make sure to take them during a different time of year. Disney at Halloween or Disney at Christmas is a totally different experience that they can enjoy too. Perhaps don\u2019t look at this as not being there for their firsts so much as it is allowing them to be there for Grandpas last.", "Holy shit YTA.", "YTA. Someone is dying man\u2026", "YTA The gift is for your daughters not you. They already know so know you gonna tell them no. Also HE IS DYING! Get over yourself.", "YTA. Your wife is right, you're being selfish. I understand you want to go to Disney with them, and you will in the years to come. Your FIL won't have that opportunity. I lost my FIL to cancer a few years back and I couldn't imagine telling him he couldn't do something special with his grandkids because I wanted to be first. This isn't about you. It's about your kids and your FIL.", "YTA. Maybe you can take comfort from knowing that children NEVER get blas\u00e9 about Disney, and there is just no way they will see all there is to see in one trip. In a couple of years more, from a different perspective, they will still be just as joyous at the thought of going to Disney.", "YTA\n\nYou're being selfish and heartless. Yes your wife should have cleared it with you but she didn't and she's apologised. \n\nTake the time in February to be with your wife and appreciate her. She's noble enough to send her kids to Disney with her parents when they never bothered to take her.\n\nYet you've made the trip all about you. Shame shame shame", "YTA, and slightly, your wife. \n\n\nShe should have told you. You aren't a child and a Disney trip wasn't really a Christmas morning surprise but she may have guessed you'd behave ungratefully and try to get out of it. \n\n\nThis might be granddads only trip with his grandkids. I get it you had plans for some unspecified future time but life gets in the way. He is severely ill enough that choosing to stop treatment and enjoy his remaining time was the best option and now you want to deny him the joy of taking his grandchildren on an experience that you acknowledge they'll love? \n\n\nYour kids are too young to have many memories of FIL that will stick, this may be their big chance at a wonderful memory and may be a last hurrah together for MIL and FIL. If the tickets to go along are too expensive then maybe ask them to help you join or just do flights and share a hotel room with your kids? There are some options here.", "What is the acronym of the whole new level of YTA? Because that's what you are, OP.\n\nYou wanted to see your kids' faces in Disney, but then you wine how much it cost to book the flights and hotel for you and your wife. What's wrong with you?!\n\nI can't even blame your wife for not telling you about the in-laws' plan, because what kind of person would object to such idea?! Of-course she was caught completely off-guard by your reaction. She is learning a lot about you in this situation. She may just learn enough to divorce you.", "NTA\n\nIt would be different if you and your wife had never spoken about this, or if you had never told her how important it was to you...but you did. I'm incredibly sorry your FIL is dying, but that doesn't mean he gets to have an experience you've been looking forward to. There are TONS of other places they could have taken the kids that don't have the emotional pull that Disney has for you: Universal, Legoland, hell, they could even do a Disney Cruise or an Adventures by Disney trip if it *had* to be Disney. \n\nI won't say they're assholes, because they asked your wife; if anything, they and the kids are the pawns/victims here of the only real AH, your wife. I get she's losing her father, but she doesn't get to ignore your wants and needs in the process.\n\nGiven that she WAS TA here, though, I'd suggest telling the ILs that the kids can only go if you can, too--not just so you get your memories, but also because someone dying of cancer should not be primarily responsible for grandchildren.", "YTA. Sometimes in life you need to make concessions due to circumstances beyond your control. This is one of them. Why would you dig your heels in when your wife is going to lose her father and your kids are going to lose their grandfather. And soon. Stop it. Now. And there are other memories you can make at a trillion other places around the globe.", "Esh.  Your wife should of cleared taking the children out of state with you.  I'd be pretty pissed if my in-laws pulled this.  But, the man does not have long to live.  You will get another chance to go.  I think you should let them go with some grace and enjoy time alone with your wife.", "YTA nobody is promised tomorrow who's to say you will be around to take them to Disney later.", "NAH \u2026 just a lack of communication during an emotional time and the future months are going to be even harder as your FIL, MIL, wife and daughters grapple with the pain of your FILs illness. Right now you have this opportunity to be an incredible man for your family. It\u2019s not just experiencing the fun once in a lifetime vacations that will mean the most to your kids and wife \u2026 enabling your family to build this memory with your FIL will last them a life time \u2026 and you have the ability to contribute to that experience. \n\nSo get in gear and start figuring out ways to contribute in a positive / meaningful way \u2026 with your in-laws potentially paying for at least some of the cost for your kids, research the rest. Figure out how to pay for you and your wife to get there too.", "YTA.  The parks will still be there after your FIL passes away.   Just take them on their second trip in the future.  And you can make it as memorable as you want it to be.  Don\u2019t be selfish and grant a dying man his final wish.", "NTA. There are plenty of other places they could go.  Doesn\u2019t have to be Disney.", "YTA", "I\u2019m seeing a lot of Y T A verdicts but i don\u2019t agree with that. Your wife didn\u2019t but should have discussed with you and she didn\u2019t. She sucks for that. Your in-laws should have discussed with you both, not just her, so they suck for that. You get to feel how you want to feel about it, and while you would kind of suck to not let them go, i would react the same way you have. My MIL stole my kids Xmas morning from me and my husband (if you want to peruse my recent post), and I\u2019m going NC with her as soon as i get back to our country of origin. \n\nIdk if i have a verdict but you should try to go.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA because that way of thinking is why I\u2019ve never gone to Disney. My mother said no to multiple sets of grandparents taking me because \u201cit should be a family trip and my mom wanted to watch me experience it\u201d. Well guess what, my mom never found the right time to go.

You are being selfish, selfish to your daughters and fil.", "YTA.\n\nThe guy is dying, ffs.\n\nIf you stop the kids from going on the trip with their grandfather, and they discover you had a hand in preventing them from doing this before losing their grandfather (and they WILL discover it at some point), they will never forgive you.\n\nJust let it go, send them on the trip and you can go at a later date.", "Unpopular opinion NTA. It\u2019s wrong on so many levels to not consult both parents before booking something like this. It is NOT the right of a grandparent to take away the opportunity of a parent to share this experience with their children. The best and only way that trip should have happened or been planned was with both parents input and parents being included on the trip as well so they could all make memories together. I understand that the grandfather does not have long left but that does not give him the right to take away the parents chance of memories with their own dang kids. There are a dozen ways he could make memories with his grandkids that don\u2019t involve robbing the actual parents of first time experiences.", "YTA.

Just because someone is dying doesn\u2019t stop them being an asshole. If he wasn\u2019t dying everyone else would overwhelmingly be an asshole so adding in the dying part doesn\u2019t negate that. You\u2019re now in a really tough spot and I don\u2019t know the solution.

That will not go over well.", "Esh, but your wife marginally more than you.", "ESH  \nThis is such a tough situation but ultimately I think it's an ESH (the everyone really being You and Your Wife). I do mildly agree with, what is the majority of comments on this post are saying, here saying YTA for wanting to take away the memories from your kids and PILs. What sucks mostly though is the fact that this was not discussed with all relevant parties before booking it. This feels rushed and deliberately done to subvert you in some capacity. There are so many ways this could have been managed so that A. You were involved in the decision making, and B. so you and your wife could also go with them. When was this trip booked? I bet it was at a time that tickets were not around $5000 for two adults as the earlier you book, generally, the cheaper things can end up being.   \n\n\nUnfortunately what's done is done though, and I feel like you don't have much choice other than saying either that they can go, or fork out the 5K and go with them. I do also agree with the sentiment of another comment - are your PILs in a state to acompany two hyped up young kids to Disney? That more than most else is something you should all really consider.", "I\u2019m going with YTA but I also understand this is still rather fresh and new. Yes your kids will have fun and you may not be able to financially swing the trip right now. However, as a family that JUST went to Disney this year with kids 8 and 11, you can still plan to take them again in a few years. They are too young and likely too small to do a lot of Disney activities. They can certainly soak in the princess stuff and smaller kid Disney things, but many rides and attractions are designated with older kids and adults in mind. Take them again in a few years when they meet all height requirements and they can do an entire new side of Disney they won\u2019t do this year with grandparents. Best of both worlds. They get the memories with grandfather, and he has something good to relive in what is likely final months, and you and wife have a new experience with the kids in a few years as well.", "ESH. Your wife should have absolutely run a multi-night vacation for your kids by you before agreeing. There\u2019s definitely some logistics I\u2019d want considered.

Your girls will enjoy every trip to Disney- and it\u2019s a massive park. They won\u2019t be able to experience everything on the first trip, trust me. There are also new exhibits all the time. They\u2019re also extremely young and to be very honest, this is as much a trip for the grandparents as it is for them. They\u2019re so young they won\u2019t remember it all that well, but the grandparents will relish every minute with them at the park and it\u2019ll be one of the last good things your FIL gets to experience with them. In short, take them again sometime. It won\u2019t subtract anything from the experience if they go once with their grandparents before one of them passes away.

They\u2019re both super into princesses and all that. We\u2019ve talked about taking them to Disney over the next few years as we know they\u2019d love it. My wife has never been before, and I\u2019ve only been once- when I was 10 years old. It was definitely a memorable trip for me as my family had to save up a while for it. We\u2019ve always known that Disney would be our big trip with our girls.\n\nIn July, my FIL got diagnosed with prostate cancer. After a few rounds of chemo and some rather intense stays at the hospital, it\u2019s only gotten worse. It\u2019s spread across to other organs in his body, and rather than trying to suffer to fight it, he\u2019s opted to just not do chemo and try to live with what time he has left. As a result, him and my MIL have decided to make more memories with family. One of these memories is to take our daughters to Disney & surprised them with the trip yesterday during Christmas.\n\nAt first, I thought my wife would be against it as well- we\u2019ve always said we\u2019ve wanted to get to experience taking them and seeing their faces. However, I found out that my MIL cleared it with my wife last month. My wife didn\u2019t tell me because she thought I would be surprised and excited for our daughters. I sat through all of the rest of the night, but when we got home we had a serious discussion about it.\n\nI told my wife that I didn\u2019t want our daughters first trip to Disney to be without us. She suggested we go along, but the trip is in February, and booking flights+hotel+tickets for just my wife and I for the time they\u2019re all going is still going to be almost $5000. I told my wife that we have to talk to her parents & decline the trip, but my wife is saying that I\u2019m being selfish and heartless by robbing our daughters of this experience & robbing them of a core memory with my FIL before he passes. Am I being out of line here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "they're only 6 and 5, odds are they'll completely forget this trip by the time they're 10 or so, if you want to take them again, then, and they'll be older, so they'll get to enjoy Disney again in a whole different way. They'll have more energy to walk around and see the sights, instead of now, when they'll probably get tired and overwhelmed quickly, plus your FIL and MIL are much older than you, right? so they'll also get tired quickly, especially FIL, who's sick.\n\nHonestly, I get you're hurt and taken by surprise and feel like you were put on the spot by this, but you're better off. Let them go, now, with FIL who won't be here in the future, and keep saving to take them again in a couple of years. Trust me, they'll enjoy it as if it were the first time they've been there.", "Let your in-laws have this one. Your MIL and your wife will remember it forever. Your kids will not. They are too young.\n\nYou can take them again in a few years and experience Disney with them like it's the first time.", "When you take your family to Disney they will have the fun to see your excitement.", "I\u2019m going against most of the answers but NAH \nYou want to be the one to take them for the first time and I get that. It\u2019ll be a memorable moment and you should experience that \nBut your fil doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left and wants to leave knowing he had a special memory with his granddaughters really I don\u2019t think anyone is necessarily wrong but this really should\u2019ve been a discussion with all 4 of you from the start", "Yes you are the asshole..If you have to ask then you know..", "Nta your wife is the ah for this. It\u2019s a big trip and to not even talk about it maybe you all could of went who knows how much energy the fil has and young kids can be a lot of work. His wife put him in a shit situation without speaking to him. Like could this all of been sorted out maybe if husband was short some money they could of borrowed from his in laws to cover some of them to make it one big trip together", "YTA.\n\nyour FIL has a LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME and the FIRST to take them is more important than them going and making memories with a dying man?\n\nWhen would you have the money for ALL of you to go? 3 years from now with proper savings?", "NAH   \n\nI'm sure I'll be down voted into oblivion but whatever.  My husband lost his mother to ovarian cancer in 2016 and like your FIL, she declined treatment and made the most of what time she had left.  He lost his father in summer 2020 from heart failure.  Again, we knew it was coming and had time to day goodbye.  Both times, his parents (they were divorced from each other and married to other people) wanted to have big make memories type of things.  Both times, my husband communicated with me about what he wanted and what his parents wanted.  Then he asked me to tell him what I felt was reasonable for our family.  His brothers did they same with their respective families and we made it work.  Communication is key.  Always.\n\nWhen we thought we would lose my dad last year he wanted what he wanted and I communicated to my husband what that was, what it looked like for me and what would be best for our family.  \n\nI'm baffled by everyone saying how selfish you are.  Yes, her father is dying.  Yes, it's a horrible thing to go through.  Yes, it changes perspective on what you thought was important and what it turns out is important.  Communication still matters.  OP's feelings matter. OPs wife's feelings matter.  His in law's feelings matter.  This is just a shitty situation but I remember taking my kids to Disney for the first time and age absolutely can matter for a lot of it.  \n\nGood luck OP.  I wish peace and healing for your family and peace for your FIL.  Also, fuck cancer.", "YTA. Normally, I would agree. But when a grandparent is dying, things change. Please try to find a way to go with them. This would be a core memory for your wife, too - getting to experience Disney with her dad before he dies.", ">Am I being out of line here?\n\nYes, you are. YTA. Your wife is absolutely right. Don't make this any more difficult than it already is for her, her parents and your kids that will soon be missing their grandpa.", "ESH, except for the grandparents. Like, your wife really should have communicated this to you in advance as 5-6 really is not really prime Disney age in regards to parentless travel. At their age/height, there is going to need to be dialogue in advance about what rides they will not be able to go on due to height requirements, what each child will have energy for, and what exactly is feasible to prevent disappointment. Planning this as early as possible by setting expectations reduces the likelihood of tantrums, or a 6 year old running off and her grandparents losing sight of her (I could outrun my grandparents at age 4, this is not unheard of). Talking the trip through with them and ensuring that the girls aren't too burnt out by the end is necessary. The waiting to tell you is the part that is upsetting to me, because it's setting everyone up for failure.\n\nThat being said, sometimes first happen and you can't be a part of them. That shouldn't be the priority right now my guy.", "To me, you're NTA. I would never let my kids go with someone else, even grandparents, for that experience. We are going next week and I have been working to make it happen for them for months. \n\nIn-laws are NTA, but their motives are selfish; they should have included parents. \n\nYour wife sucks. She knew, agreed to this, and kept it from you and now faults you for being unhappy. \n\nMaybe you don't know - Disney is a huge undertaking for kids and their caretakers. It's fun, but it's overstimulating and exhausting. I would not think that a sick grandparent is up to it alone, let alone with very little kids and no parents. \n\nI would make whatever needed to happen to join the trip; wife needs to step up to make this happen now that kids know.", "YTA. \n\nYou're thinking about yourself, not your kids. Selfish.", "YTA Death is always the trump card.", "ESH. I think how you handled it was wrong. I think your wife should have keyed you in before saying yes. I think since your FIL is sick I\u2019d let them go seeing as you will have many firsts.", "YTA The man is dying and he wants to make special memories with your daughters that they will hopefully remember. You are being selfish and only thinking of yourself. Disney is more fun for the kids when they are older and can ride all the rides. You will be able to take them as many times as you want in the future but their grandfather won\u2019t be able too.", "YTA and being selfish", "I\u2019d be inclined to say ESH if you were upset about her not clearing an out-of-state trip for the kids without you guys or something, but you only seem concerned about the whole \u201cfirst trip to Disney\u201d thing. So like.. YTA here, friend.\n\nSeriously, there are a ton of alternatives to shelling out 5K for travel expenses and accommodations. Depending on where you live, there\u2019s always the option of just road tripping it. I\u2019ve lived in south Alabama all my life, and people from the whole ass opposite side of the country drive through the area headed to Disney all the time (I know this because they tend to run in and out of the gas stations around here while excitedly talking about how close they are lol it\u2019s super sweet). You also don\u2019t have to book a vacation package with reservations in the on-site hotels since there are a ton of hotels close by (and several within walking distance). I know that\u2019s still a lot of work and cash on your part, esp depending on where you\u2019d be traveling from, but you\u2019d be surprised how easy it is to knock a lot off the price tag when you plan it all on your own without using a travel agent or booking one of Disney\u2019s vacation packages.\n\nIn any case, please don\u2019t be a dick and take this away from your kids or their grandparents purely because you wanted to be the one to take them on their first Disney trip. From the sound of things in your post, it\u2019s likely that their grandfather won\u2019t be able to go on another Disney trip at all. Let your kids go and make memories with their grandparents while they\u2019re able, dude. Shit, just do some research and crunch some numbers and figure out a way to get down there WITH them so you can ALL make the memories together. And then when you and your wife take them on the next trip, look at their faces when they talk about those memories.\n\nIt\u2019ll be fucking WORTH IT. Way more than just being able to say you took them first.", "If it's that important to you to see your kids first trip then make the money work. But don't take away the trip from the kids. \n\nWe would go to Disney with my fil, he's gone now. But I'd pay anything to go on another trip with him and the kids.", "You want to tell your dying father in law he can\u2019t take his grandkids to Disney before he dies and tell your kids they can\u2019t go on a trip to Disney they\u2019re now fully aware of, and you\u2019re really not sure you\u2019re the asshole? \n\nYou may be thinking they\u2019ll forgive you in a few months because they\u2019re young, but when they\u2019re old enough to realize the memories you took away from them with their deceased grandfather, your relationship with your daughters will be irrevocably damaged.\n\nObviously YTA.", "It was wrong of your wife to agree to this idea without discussing it with you.  You certainly have a right to be the ones taking your own kids to Disney.   \n\n\nHowever, this is kind of an unusual circumstance.  At this age, the kids will not remember much about a trip.  You could take them when they are a few years older and they will remember a lot more.  Do you really want to deny your FIL when he is dying?  It\u2019s not like he can wait and go later?\n\nI\u2019m not sure that anyone is an AH.  It\u2019s just a choice.  Keep in mind also how this decision  might affect your wife since she is losing her father.  Maybe the decision is to go with them even if it is expensive.", "NTA for reacting as you did. Your wife should have discussed this with you - very TA of her to keep that from you. If your FIL is experiencing any weakness, low energy, symptoms that could impact his participation in the trip, I would be concerned about them going with the in-laws. Also - some people just don\u2019t want their children to take long trips without them. I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t live in the state or country where the vacation will be, so if anything were to go wrong, you would not be close by.", "YTA your wife is right.

Your wife - his daughter - is on board with it. Only your wounded pride (because you can\u2019t afford it) and your own selfishness is standing in the way. \n\nAlso, why argue over this with your wife at time when she\u2019s likely struggling with anticipatory grief over the eventual death of her Dad?\n\nETA: I lost both of my grandfathers at a young age. I wish I had more memories of them both, because I adored them. I would\u2019ve been so mad to grow up and learn my father had denied me an amazing experience with them, simply because he was jealous he couldn\u2019t afford to take me himself.", "ESH. Or at least, both you and your SO suck. I'm assuming your in-laws checked with your wife under the assumption she'd check with you.\n\nYou're being selfish, not only to your in-laws, one of which is dying from cancer, but to your daughters, by denying them a chance to create memories with their grandfather before he is no more. That's not at all unlikely to ferment into pretty serious resentment towards you in the future, which will weigh a lot more than the happy memories you *might* create by taking them to Disneyland yourself in a few years.\n\nThe cat (i.e. the gift) is out of the bag, and you can't put o it back in without being an AH, even if taking the cat or of the bag was an AH move towards you.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019ve been to Disney 4 or 5 times throughout my life, and by far my most meaningful trip was the last one my family went on before my uncle died. I\u2019m eternally grateful that my family made that specific trip happen. Even though he was super sick, it was the last time I got to see him *really* out and about, enjoying a place he loved with the people he loved.\n\nWhile I totally get wanting their first trip to be with you and your wife, this should be an exception. The perfect solution would be everyone going together, but if it isn\u2019t financially possible (as you discussed in the post) then the next best thing would be allowing the kids to go. \n\nWhat better memory to have as one of your last with a grandparent? Disney is special every time you go, no matter who you go with. Your future trips with them will still be special, and you guys *will* have opportunities for future trips.

It sucks to be in that position because 1) you were out of town 2) they knew that was something special you wanted to do. I understand the grandpa has cancer and that\u2019s very unfortunate, but for no one to have an adult discussion with the father of said children is wild to me. The wife knew what he would think and I bet you big money if they had a discussion about it they could\u2019ve come up with a way to do it all together.

Her trying to hide it and play it off as \"I thought u would be happy for them\" is total bullshit.  She hid it because she knew he wouldn't like it.

OP's wife is grieving and so I don't blame her but this is not a one parent decision. \n\nI think if the grandparents were going to make that offer, they should have offered to cover OP and his wife.

If any other person involved grew to resent OP over this decision it would be valid. Disney doesn\u2019t get less exciting if a kid\u2019s already been, Disney is always changing and always exciting.

It's pretty much impossible to see the entire park in one day, too, so OP can get plenty of new magical moments with the kids on their second time there.", "Also what they get out of it will change as they get older.\n\nRight now it's probably all about princesses.

I\u2019ve never actually been, but it\u2019s a giant theme park, yes? Every theme park I\u2019ve been to 9-10 would be a much more appropriate and fun age to take the kids. 5-6 would get tired, over stimulated and cranky pretty fast, couldn\u2019t go on a lot of the rides, and would have much less patience for waiting in lines. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t take them, I just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s the \u201cprime age\u201d\n\nEdit: based on the replies, it seems Disney *is* made for that age, so pardon my ignorance.

Thanks for the info about it.", "Your point is EXACTLY what OP DOESN'T want.\n\nEXACTLY.\n\nGreat..every time OP tries to do anything with Disney it's going to be associated with their dead/sick grandpa. \n\nOP doesn't get the first moment AND his later effort will be tied with his In-laws. OP lost the exact core moment he wanted to make with his children. That is huge. People dream of taking their kids to Disney 'someday'. For someone else to just sweep in and take that moment...that blows.\n\nI get why he's pissed. Life isn't fair. OP's feelings are valid. His feelings aren't bigger than grandpa being sick, but they are valid.", "So agree. My parents took me for my 16th birthday, I remember every moment & I'll always have that memory of being with my parents.\n\nThey apparently took me to visit my aunt in another country when I was 6 and I don't remember any of that lol", "That's how I'm feeling about it. Not just energy, but what if there is a medical emergency? We've now got two little kids without a primary caregiver. If FIL needs to go to the hospital due to issues, where does that leave the kids and MIL with no additional support.

I think she knew OP would say no so she surprised him along with the kids so he couldn't say no.", "They talked to spouse only. A decision that would have included BOTH parents as it pertains to THEIR children, not just hers. Be it maliciously or innocently, they hid it. They purposely withheld information.", "That\u2019s quite a leap to make. Nothing suggests that", "Exactly. \n\nOP does not seem to care about his FIL or his daughters.", "Oh that too, absolutely!", "This is a \u201cgift\u201d that never should have been approved without both parents (since they are married) approving.

Really they could have done anything else with their granddaughters why did it have to be Disney... something many families save for?

I would have been heartbroken to have my kids go without me. I was tired, cranky and definitely done with Disney at times but it was also the best time of my entire life and memories I will treasure forever.", "No, she's thinking of her dying father and his relationship with her kids. OP is thinking of himself and their relationship with their kids. No one is being totally selfish, other than the wife for making a unilateral decision about a major vacation without talking with OP.

Everyone keeps talking about the grandparents making memories with them but aren\u2019t looking at the bigger picture. Yes it would be nice for them to take the kids and have a good time but what happens if grandpa is having a bad week when they go. Both parents should be there if an emergency was to arise, not leave two elderly grandparents in charge. It would be different if it was like an hour drive but from what I\u2019ve gathered it\u2019s not. \n\nThe safety of the children should be the main concern not being the first one to take them.

Disney has a lot of rides for the smaller age range. There are definitely those for adults and it can be tiring but 5-6 is a great age to take them and the characters will definitely be more magical at that time then when older.", "I\u2019ve been to Disney many time, from 2yo to adulthood, and I think 5-6 is prime because you still believe the mascots are real, like Santa, but are old enough to remember it forever. It\u2019s not someone in a costume, you are meeting the REAL Mickey Mouse and all his friends!!!  \nI remember realizing at some point (around 8yo maybe) that it couldnt be the real Mickey, but that feeling of meeting him when I was 5-6 stayed with me my whole life. It is a core memory and, in my case anyway, kept the magic alive in me, and pushed me to want to create that feeling of pure joy with others.", "It really is the prime time though because its when they will think the characters are real. I went at 6 and I honestly thought I was meeting Belle and Ariel and going to a real castle, by 10 I would have known it was an actor in a costume.", "It absolutely 100% is NOT prime age for Disney.  They are only going to be able to handle half a day at the parks at most before a melt down happens.  Which,  if you're going with old sick people works out fine.  Half the day at the Park and half at the hotel pool.", "I went at 11 and was bored to tears, granted this was decades ago but it was definitely geared to younger kids.", "There are a ton of rides kids that age can go on, and they are still young enough to think the characters are real when they meet them. \n\nBut, they are unlikely to have a whole ton of memories from that time as they get older. I went about that age and my only \"memories \" stem from the pictures in the picture frame my sister kept on her desk. My daughter has been about every other year, and has no real memories of her trips before the age of seven.\n\nIn sum, this trip is for the adults to watch the kids enjoy themselves. Your FIL is dying and wants quality time with his granddaughters. By the time you save up and go back, it will be almost like they're going for the first time, and they'll be big enough to ride a bunch of things for the first time anyway.", "So we just came back. My kids are 11, 9 and 6. My 11 year old was in a weird age. Too old for the magic of characters and too young for some of the other things. He enjoyed it, but he prefers our local Cedar Faire Park. My 6 year old? It was pure magic for her. She believed in the characters, she loved the rides, she loved every moment. 6 was perfect. \n\nDisney is very different than Six Flags/Cedar Faire parks. The rides are more theme oriented than thrill rides and with a few exceptions, the height limit for most rides is 44\".", "I have news for OP.

Are you really trying to pull 'poor OP' when his FIL is dying and his last wish is to make a special memory of him for his granddaughters, so when they look back and remember Grandpa it's not just uncomfortable visits to him lying in a hospital bed?", "A valid point, having seen many members of my family go through cancer treatments and losing the battle I fully understand your point and had failed to consider it. I would guess it depends on how the cancer is treating FIL, some just don't have the ER visits while others do.", "so what? it is only for  plane ticket. it only take me 2 hours to drive there, and we only visited less than ten times, Disney is expensive, four parks there. i don't know how many parks  they will visit and where to stay.\n\nDisney has their own hotel inside the park, fancy and costly. you don't just pay for the hotel and park tickets, more others.", "Exactly.  I feel like its not shocking for them to talk to ONE part of a married couple, and assume that they would share that with their spouse", "Yes... also if his FIL did not have cancer, they wouldn't have to rush their kids to Disney.\n\nAt this point it is what it is. OP has the choice of either suck it up and make everyone happy, or be the AH that he is and\n\n1. deprive his kids from their last chance of building happy memories with their grandfather\n2. take away Disney trip from his kids\n3. prevent his dying FIL from spending time with his grand kids at Disney\n4. make his wife question herself if she actually know the man she married", "Usually when you talk to one spouse it is assumed they will fill the other in.

Tell wife if this is so important, then they, grandparents, can pay for both of you to go otherwise no deal. This might be, and I emphasize might be because it seems a little harsh, but it might be ultimatum time. Since wife seems incapable of playing fair, tell her the other memory her dad is going to get is going to be your divorcing her for her excluding you in the decision making of your family.\n\nReading the comments I can better articulate what is bothering me. She, wife, has unilaterally made the decision that yes the kids could go without so much as a notice til the last minute after everything is decided for OP. She had a month. That to me implies she is ok hiding things from op. That is not a good or healthy marriage. (I lost a family member to cancer a few years ago and while that member was  involved in memories- we knew they were going to die, all parents were consulted, nothing was hidden). Do I think OP should swallow his pride? Yes. But I also think the grandparents and wife are major AH's which is why I vote nta.\n\nOP feel free to be as petty as f in the future. \"Well honey you remember you didn't really tell me about that trip til I was broadsided with it...\" also go ahead and embarrass her now and tell your in laws \"i'm really sorry fil is dying but it really surprised me and put me on the spot that wife didn't tell me you had asked to do this so in the future, please run it by me too so I am in the loop\".", "Dude. The man is dying. The tickets are already purchased. Your kids are 5 & 6. You have a lifetime to take them to Disney. \n\nRefusal on your part is nothing but 100% selfishness.\n\nYTA", "YTA", "YTA. They will have different Disney experiences with y\u2019all than they will have with their grandparents. If you had created a narrative where y\u2019all took them to Disney for the first time and just told them this lie their entire life, they would have no flipping idea. They are only going to remember the photos they take. I also think it\u2019s more special for THEM that their grandparents took them regardless. It\u2019s just Disney. It is not that serious.", "YTA. Your FIL is dying. Let the girls go. It will be one of their last memories with him. And you should go as well. Disney is $5k for two people no matter what time of year you go.", "YTA Ebenezer", "YTA- it\u2019s not about you all the time\u2026 plus there are more than one park. Let them make some great memories with their grandpa.", "YTA. \n\nImagine being 20 years in the future and your daughters said they wish they knew the grandad more. You would have been that roadblock to that relationship for a petty 5 minutes look on your kids faces. \n\nJesus man. Let it go", "YTA. You're denying your children a lasting experience with their grandparents who are on borrowed time on the chance of a maybe one day trip. If you deny them now and then something happens later to where you can't afford it, what then? Disney is crazy expensive and I'm sure part of the driving decision for this trip specifically is to ensure the girls get that experience before their grandfather passes. You need to let go of the wrong idea that not being the first is going to somehow ruin the Disney experience you have with your kids. No kid ever said Disney was ruined because they went twice.", "Also there are ways to make Disney less expensive. Especially in February. First - look at flights into Tampa instead of Orlando. Always cheaper. If you are a Costco member, you can book your whole trip through them or just your rental car. Next, don\u2019t stay on property! There are lots of fabulous places to stay that are roomier, nicer, and less expensive. Check out Villadirect.com and reunionvacationhomes.com. We always rent a house - have our own pool and everyone has their own room. Cheaper than staying on property and so so worth it. Parking isn\u2019t terrible and once you pay to park it\u2019s good the whole day at any of the WDW parks if you want to park hop. You probably won\u2019t since it\u2019s your first trip but know it\u2019s an option. Lastly, you can save a bit on tickets if you know what options you want. They sell packs where you have to go to a different park each day that are cheaper than tickets that are good for any park. Plus you don\u2019t have to get the park hopper option and honestly with kids your age, and it being a first trip, you don\u2019t need it. (I would get the any park any day tickets though - your girls will probably want to be at Magic Kingdom most of the time.).   Lastly, check to see if you still need reservations for the park. They started this after Covid and reservations at some parks fill up fast - especially at Hollywood Studios because of the new Star Wars rides. Toy Story land is at Hollywood Studios which your kids will love. Everything else there is probably a bit too old\nFor them but fun for you and your wife - Star Wars, Tower of Terror and Rock N Roller coaster.  \n\nAnimal Kingdom is cool for the Avatar Rides and if you like the zoo but if you aren\u2019t going to Park Hop, it\u2019s not where I\u2019d want to spend a full day. (That\u2019s just me. Other people love it.). My family finds Epcot to be incredibly boring - but I think the new Frozen ride is there, Soarin\u2019 is cool and the Test Track is fun.  But other people love it over there, especially because you can eat and drink \u201caround the world.\u201d  Just know that there isn\u2019t a lot there that\u2019s going to keep your girls entertained. So, if you\u2019re not park hopping, think about whether you want to spend a full day there.", "Yes YTA and yes you\u2019re being selfish.", "Are you trying to book one of the really nice Disney resorts to stay at and flying first class? Because if you\u2019re talking about Disney World, I literally booked tickets and resort for under $2k in February this week for my fianc\u00e9 and I. And Orlando has a crap ton of flights, unless you\u2019re flying in from another country it shouldn\u2019t be that bad. For just the two of you there\u2019s no way it should be $5k for that time of year unless you\u2019re trying to be extra fancy. \n\nI\u2019m going to say NAH because I can see all sides. But I think not allowing them to go in the end is a bad idea.", "Massive massive YTA so because you can't be there you want your kids to miss out on going and being able to build memories with their dying grandfather. You are such an unbelievably huge a-hole for doing that. Your kids find out they will hate you, I'm surprised your wife doesn't already but your in laws definitely should.", "Maybe have a convo with the in-laws about them helping to fund your trip too. Explain that this is an experience you want with your children and, while you are willing to share it with them, you can't fund it. (I'm assuming you can't rather than won't fund it for the two of you.)\n\nI'm not sure where I stand on the question of AITA. I only know if it were me, I would refuse to let my in-laws deprive me of the experience of Disney with my kids on their first trip. So, if YTA, then I am too.", "YTA. My grandpa was my best friend until he passed when I was 7. When I was about your daughters\u2019 age, he went on a cross country trip with me, my mom, her sister and sister\u2019s family. They are some of my earliest core memories. It\u2019s been almost 40 years. Please do not take this away from your daughters. It\u2019s not about Disneyland.", "YTA.  \n\nHow incredibly selfish of you to deny them a trip to Disney because one day years from now you might take them.  \n\nHow incredibly selfish to deny this experience to their dying grandfather.\n\nThere is nothing about this decision but your selfishness. \n\nNews flash: \n\n\\- Going twice is better than going once\n\n\\- Your kids don't care whether you are the one to see their excited faces, they don't even know you are looking.\n\n\\- Your expectations might be too high if you think they are going to be cutely wide eyed with delight the whole time they are in a chaotic, sensory overloading theme park.", "For the specific question, definitely YTA. But the wife letting this being sprung on him along with the girls was also an asshole move.", "More ESH. It **really** sucks for OP that he can't be with his kids for it. The wife is an even bigger AH for not discussing it with him. Grandparents should consider the fact that the parents would obviously want to go and it's going to be seriously hard work for them to manage it on their own. Biggest AH is the wife.", "The daughters never should have known about it. \n\nThe wife purposely hid it from him. I don\u2019t believe for one second she did it because she thought he\u2019d be surprised too. She did it because she knew he\u2019d be pissed. \n\nThe grandparents could have easily chosen somewhere else. The wife never should have okayed then, let along without talking to her husband.", "I honestly would bite the bullet and  spend the money and go. Heck I would use a credit card so I could be with my parents and kids. I would want those happy memories with my dad before he died and I don't care about the cost.", "Right, agreed. YTA. Ask the grandparents to kindly take pics and videos and allow them to have a sparkly \u2728\ufe0f memory of their grandpa!", "YTA but so is your wife for not clearing this with you when her parents first brought it up.", "Not sure how anybody can argue with your comment here tbh", "My Dad died this year and the C took hold quickly. He didn\u2019t get a chance to take my kids to all the places he wanted to (delayed due to covid). OP, YTA.", "YTA-for reasons stated here. But so is your wife! Gaslighting the reason for \u201cskipping\u201d your consent on a big ticket item and event so you would be surprised is just awful! Does she do this often? \n\nPlease let them gave a happy memory with their grandparents. And sit down with your wife.", "NTA. Wife went behind OPs back and did not check in with them. Memories can be created at home as well, you know?", "Seconded.", "There is no way that OP can do a family holiday at Disney for less than 5k, he should just join this trip and take it as a blessing that he will only be paying for him and his wife. you add up Park tickets, hotel, flights, the outrageously priced food..... This will be the cheapest Disney holiday he will ever get. N.T.A. that it wasn't discussed with you but YTA if you now try to block the trip.\n\nETA... Clearly this trip is very time constrained, they probably felt they didn't really have time to wait for you to save up or find perfect dates, they really just need to go before he's too ill ... things can go south very quickly and Disney can be exhausting.", "Seriously. I feel like I am still recovering from our September trip. Two elderly people, one literally dying of cancer, cannot handle two young children by themselves at Disney.", "That was my concern as well. Maybe OP and his wife can just get a credit card or a loan so they can go too. I mean, it's not ideal financially but FIL is literally dying and the kids will have to live the rest of their lives without their grandpa. May as well make some good memories while he's still around.", "But to kids it isnt just an amusement park. We took our 5yr old son to Legoland last year and he still talks about it like it was yesterday. I cant imagine if a kid loved all the disney princesses or characters what they would react like.", "Not to mention he WANTS to go, but has NO actual plans at all for the foreseeable future, and even finds it too expensive to go there with just his wife.", "This is an underrated comment. A lot of other commenters have brought up good logistical questions that should have been considered by both parents and grandparents. What happens if someone, child or grandparent needs to go to the hospital? \nHis wife sucks because she knew he would be upset to not be on the kids\u2019 first Disney trip. She didn\u2019t tell him on purpose. She could have told him and they could have figured out a way to ALL go on the trip. I would have been heartbroken to miss that with my kids. 5-6 is a great age for Disney. They are really into characters/meet & greets, plenty of rides they can do. We have been in the parks from open to close including magic hours for staying on property with them at those ages.", "Agreed!", "This. It seems odd to me to take this trip and exclude the kids' parents, especially since they are so young. If the grandparents want to take the kids, they should have planned to take their parents as well.", "I flew halfway across the country by myself at the age of 6 to spend a week with my grandparents. It's not unusual at all for kids to visit their grandparents, why wouldn't they also be able to take them on a trip? Some people trust their family members. They raised them, after all.", "That\u2019s what I said too! Disney isn\u2019t the best option for their situation. I\u2019m kinda surprise more people have said that.", "This! NTA \n\nYou never should have been left in the dark about this. My children going out of state with my in laws (dying or not) is a decision that I WILL be a part of.  If I were to get blind sided by this I would be the same. Why were you never included? They KNEW this was important to you and they went behind your back. Now they have made it to where you look like the bad guy. \n\nYour wife is TA. She can stay home and then you can afford to go with your kids. I\u2019m kidding. But damn I would feel disrespected as a parent to not be allowed to be a part of the discussion and decisions of my children. \n\nI\u2019m surprised at all of the oh he\u2019s dying comments you have to let them go. No. Dying does not excuse asshole behavior of ignoring a parents right to be included in decisions for their children.", "Lol no", "100% agree with this.", "God thank you. I don't have the best relationship with my grandparents so I'm not sure if that's why I'm on a different side than so many here, but I just can't wrap my head around this. Grandparents are an important relationship but I'm not sure why so many people think it's reasonable for the grandparents to expect to get to share this experience with their grandkids, but somehow not reasonable for OP as a parent to be annoyed he *won't* have it with his kids? People also seem to be brushing this off as \"it's just Disney, it's not that special of an experience,\" but if it's not that special... why can't the grandparents choose something else? It doesn't seem as if they have a particular attachment to this specific experience, they just want memories before the grandfather passes away. That's completely understandable obviously, but there are many ways and places to make memories. I also think people expressing concern from grandpa's health and what that will actually look like during a trip, and even if that will change the kids' outlook on Disney going forward, is totally reasonable", "I think you need to reread the post.

Or like, at all.", "Sorry father in law", "I went when I was somewhere between 8 and 10 and I only vaguely remembered it. Went as an adult and I literally burst into happy tears when we came around from the entrance and saw the castle down at the end of Main Street. I wasn't expecting it *at all*. My MIL was 60 at the time and she basically turned into a gleeful little kid, it was awesome.", "Indeed. My kids went a handful of time around the ages of like 4/6 because we had a friend that worked there, so we got to go multiple times one year for free. \n\nA couple months ago when they got invited again, at ages 8&10, they were so delighted. Had an even better time, if anything, because they had an idea of what they wanted to do and wasted less time. There is NO reason to be worried your kid isnt gonna be as happy the 2nd time around", "A suggestion I haven\u2019t seen anyone else mention yet, how about the parents fly in the day before and go to Magic Kingdom the next day so they too are a part of that core memory. Sometimes two wishes can take flight with the right momentum!!\n\nEveryone can win!! The grandparents can be the bulk memory of the trip but the parents could so easily make that day brighter by standing in line and ensuring that Grandpa gets to enjoy his day there as well!! \n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be as expensive for last minute planning. \n\nAs someone that\u2019s been to many theme parks, the grueling parts of standing in line, finding bathrooms and making the most of the venues can be a bit much if you\u2019re not familiar.\n\nAdd to that coping with an illness and not having an easy ability to navigate around strollers, rope walkways and trams.\n\nAnd buy them the memory maker!! It\u2019s about $150ish and you will get to see them enjoy all the rides. Plus if the parents go the family will have so many photos from their phones.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a feel for how to manage your future expectations of the park and each time you can build on those memories. \n\nYou can deny the trip but I have an inkling that you\u2019ll have that moment of regret later on when you are on your own trip. It\u2019ll be too late as there\u2019s no apology or redo possible.\n\nYTA but adjust your own desires for someone else that doesn\u2019t have time to be disappointed.", "Not only that, he can take his trip to whichever Disney they don\u2019t go to (Land vs. World) and still get to have a bunch of firsts.", "Exactly.

In what world, no matter what the circumstances, is it okay for one parent to make a major travel decision about kids this age without talking to the other parent first? If the grandfather wasn't dying, this would be a no-brainer. This is a trip involving: two very young children, a long distance trip involving flights (have the girls ever even flown before?), staying multiple days away from their parents, AND going with a grandfather in very poor health. What were any of them thinking? The only possible way that this might have been acceptable is if the grandparents were paying for the whole family to go. OP was backed into the position of being an AH if he didn't agree, which sucks.

Tiny ass old room that didn't even have a microwave and barely any theming. Well at least you have the free transportation right? Except we ended up using ride shares most of the time to get back and forth cause for the free transportation you'll be waiting in line for an hour + to get smashed into a bus depending on the time of day. \n\nWe did another trip with some Disney and some Universal and stayed off site and it was much nicer. Got a place with a kitchen so we saved money on food and still spent significantly less despite using ride shares to get to the park cause it was that much cheaper.

Meet them in the morning, spend all day with them, then you head off to your hotel when it's their bedtime.\n* There are also numerous tremendously cheaper hotels near DIsneyworld. Some of them are \"good neighbor\" hotels that have transportation and some of the Disney perks, so you can even get in to the park at the same time as them.\n* Drive instead of fly to save money. But consider that Disney charges to park every day, at the hotel or park, so this might not save money.\n* If it's a week trip, could you go for just the first part of it? Go the first 3 days, get to see their first time at Disney, they stay on the trip?\n* While a bit morbid, if you really want to be there as much as possible ... is your wife inheriting anything? Can she essentially ask for a loan on that so you can all go together?\n\nIf you're planning to go in a few years and you can't afford Disney now, I'm sorry to tell you but it's only going to get more expensive every year, next time you have to pay for the 2 of you *and* your kids, and February is roughly the cheapest time to go. If you go now it's going to be cheaper than later anyway. You might not be able to make the whole week work, you might not be able to eat at Cinderella's Castle and Be Our Guest with them, but it sounds like you can't afford that stuff later either.

If he God forbid dies during the trip, those kids aren't coming back with souvenirs and happy memories, they're coming back traumatized.\n\nThis situation is awful because it's already out of the bottle, and that is not OP's fault.

I don't know what it was called or what it was about, all I know is the building and the line for the ride was all air conditioned,  and the kid was more than happy to go on this ride a few times, so I figured I had the next couple hours settled with something relatively peaceful... Nope.

If they don't live close by there's either a ton of driving or airfare, plus the cost of eating out and buying trinkets for the little ones, and I  would guesstimate the average cost for a family of four to go for a couple of days is around $4000 for a single vacation.

At the very least, they should be able to loan you the $5000. Set out repayment plan etc. To be frank, if they can't afford to lend you $5000, they can't afford to take the girls to Disney. They have end of life care, funeral costs and your MIL's ongoing living costs. If $5000 is make or break for them, they should be saving that money because they are going yo need it.

He may not have even thought about the cancer part yet.", "I agree.  It was a surprise for the girls, not him.  If he would have known earlier he would have had time to put money aside to pay for a trip.  I don\u2019t have the spare cash that I could just pay for this trip with only a months notice.", "I think OP is an asshole, because their reasoning is bad. But, seriously who sends their 5 year old away without a parent?  They should have been involved and going from the beginning, super weird, Wtf is wrong with OPs wife?", "I'm going with NTA precisely because the FIL is dying. What if he contracts covid on the flight over and dies during the trip? I don't know how the grandparents think they can physically pull this off without the parents to help.", "dude, OP''s wife *was* included. if anything she's the AH too for not bringing it up with OP. YTA too for having this opinion", "My biggest issues with this trip is that it hasn\u2019t been properly thought out and none of the adults in this situation are communicating with each other.", "This is my biggest issue with all the YTAs.  It should have been discussed with him before the decision was made.  It\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t want the kids to go but that he\u2019d like to experience his kids first time there - he said how it was such a special experience when his parents took him - but now if he still wants to have that experience he only has a month to put money aside and make reservations which will be $5,000.  I\u2019m sorry, but  I wouldn\u2019t be able to come up with an extra $5,000 right now, or even in just one month.", "I agree with you.  I\u2019m assuming the grandparents might be in their late 50\u2019s to early 60\u2019s.  With one grandparent that is ill, will the other grandparent be able to wrangle two small children.  Being a grandparent I would never consider taking my grandchildren on a trip like this without at least one of their parents in attendance.  Too many things could come up where the parent needs to be present.", "I used to even work at Disney.  It's a theme park.  An expensive one with relatively good themeing, but it's also just a theme park.  The whole \"magic of Disney\" is marketing. There's plenty of non magical Disney moments, like the 4 o'clock tantrum/rain hour and waiting in lots of lines.\n\nYou can take your kids again at 10-12 when they're big enough to go on more of the rides roo.", "This is what I keep coming back to.\n\nWe did Disney only once, and it was exhausting for my parents who were pretty young! It feels irresponsible to send two young kids with their grandparents to tackle all this travel and all the physical activity the parks require. \n\nAnd then what if something happens? What if their grandfather's health takes a turn and he's hospitalized down there? What is the plan for if he needs medical attention? Who will be minding the children while that happens? What if the grandparents get tired and have to pack it in early? Will the children understand and be accepting of it?", "Also all this pressure parents put on it ruins it. Kids are given an inch and take it a mile, as anyone knows, and putting all this hype around \u201cthe Disney trip milestone\u201d gets kids worked up in all sorts of weird ways. I personally was wildly, wildly disappointed after all the hype.", "Totally. I was always told as a kid that we\u2019d go when \u201cwe could afford it\u201d. We never went. If my grandparents wanted to take me my mom would have sighed a sigh of relief so heavy, she would have pissed herself. \nI\u2019ve also always said (not to her, to myself) that I want to take my daughter when I could afford it. She\u2019s never been either. And I\u2019m a lot better off financially than my mom and aunt were. It\u2019s a huge cost for a vacation and I can think of about 30 different and more fun vacation ideas that are less than half of that cost, so we usually do one of those. It\u2019s hard to justify spending that much for what is essentially work.", "It's a theme park, it's not real. Plenty of opportunities to teach and show your kids real life lessons that they will take forward. I wouldn't put a theme park as the pinnacle of childhood experiences.", "Doesn't matter. Have the feckin conversation, that's communication that's marriage.\n\nGuess what op might say (yes or no) is not what should have happened", "Excellent point. If money is an issue, adults can still have an amazing time just touring the numerous themed hotels and Disney Springs (free to enter shopping and entertainment Center).", "A Frontier flight to Orlando is like $50...", "It's because it used to not be so packed and overpriced. Recently it has absolutely jumped the shark, but there are so many people that go just for the nostalgia of when they were kids.", "I dunno man, I went when I was 3 and remember a pretty good amount of it.", "This...what a legacy their grandpa will leave with them.", "I went with my husband before we married, and we still had a blast.", "Also, I was 3 and my brother was 5 when we first went to Disneyland, and though we personally don\u2019t have a lot of memories of the trip, I absolutely LOVE hearing my parents and my grandparents tell us stories (even 23 years later) of the things that happened and how we reacted, and even more now we\u2019re adults but the stories of things that went wrong or weird with my parents and grandparents. I\u2019m so grateful for those stories and memories, even if I don\u2019t exactly have them myself. If OP sticks to his \u2018no\u2019 he\u2019s truly robbing both his in laws AND daughters of amazing memories and stories.

I've done amusement parks helping people who are disabled and needed wheelchairs.\n\nIt is a huge amount of work.  We always made sure to have 1:1 staff:resident ratios for such trips.  And it was still overwhelming.\n\nThere is no practical way the grandmother can help both a frail/dying husband and two fairly young children, on her own.  If the husband has a crisis and needs to go to a doctor or hospital, who will watch the kids?  If a child wanders off or has a meltdown, who will tend the grandfather and other child?\n\nFive and six are pretty young for children to be going on a multi-day trip without a parent, even with grandparents.\n\nThe trip is a bad idea, but not for the reasons that OP gives - the selfish desire to be there for the \"first trip to Disney.\"  \n\nIt will be a logistical nightmare, if the grandmother has to push a wheelchair AND keep track of a five and six year old.", "Also it's going to be hell for a grandmother with two kids very young (meaning baby carriages, which are extremely bulky and hard to maneuver as a person who has been a victim of people hitting me with them), and either a wheelchair and/or an ECV.", "The OP is an asshole and being very selfish.  The only reasons he gave was he wanted to do it first, which is shockingly shellfish.  It's not about relationship building, it's about seeing there faces because that will bring him pleasure.   He doesn't care about his wife, his wife mum and dying father and most importantly his own children, who won't get many chances to spend time with their granddad again.  Wife should have told him sooner but he is being very selfish!", "To add to that- Disney is INSANE with prices for everything. From character meals to gift shops stuff to food.\nIt\u2019s a \u201csave up for a while and budget\u201d sort of thing. This chance may be the only time that grandparents will foot the extras bill. Things like toys or balloons or extra stuff that op and wife would likely sadly have to skip.\nTheir trip with the family in the future can be focused on doing other things or saving up for things they didn\u2019t get to do with grandparents.\nBut telling a 5 and 6 year old no a whole bunch (especially since it seems like cost is a massive factor here) is going to be much much harder than op realizes.\n\nI went twice as a kid. The first time was a gift from my grandparents for me and my parents (my dad was sick the entire time lol) and they included some money for extras (there were as many back then and things were somewhat affordable).\nThe second trip my bff came (her parents paid her part). She comes from a ton of money, I don\u2019t. My parents had to budget everything and even I saved my money from cat sitting or other things so that at 10 I could buy my own stuff. My family is by no means poor but the cost was a big one and my mom prepared me by explaining we didn\u2019t have money for extras. Luckily my bffs mom did the same thing for her, explaining this was about us having fun together not the expensive extras she was used to from past trips that she and her parents took (where they\u2019d drop 2k on gift shop stuff easily).\nIt was great but I can\u2019t imagine trying to tell that to a six year old now with how everything is set up and the costs have jumped!", "OP is also only 28... MIL is more likely talking about someone in her 50s than 90", "I am not arguing with anything you said, but holy shit do people actually go to Disney World every day for 2 weeks on their vacations??", "I totally agree with this - Disney can be hard! We typically average 25 to 30K steps a day when we go. I took my D1 (cross country/track) athlete, and there were some days he couldn\u2019t even keep up!", "I agree with your take here and it gets me worried about our family's current situation.  My MIL and FIL love our 5 year old and want to do as much as possible with him, but they get tired quickly and sometimes are forgetful and make some mistakes as a result.  Like leaving the stove on, or our garage door unlocked overnight in the city.  I know that I am going to need to find a middle ground when it comes to entrusting our little guy to them, luckily my wife and I communicate openly and regularly.  \n\nOn topic I'll second that OP's wife is the ah in this situation, albeit unintentional.  I'm guessing she was excited and thought it would be really fun for her daughters but it's a decision that should have been discussed first with OP", "OP stated that to pay for just himself and his wife to join them would be about $5000. Not everyone has that much money sitting around to be spent at fairly short notice.\n\nI get it. My sister bought tickets off a friend for her and my daughter to go to PINK'S concert. I was pretty miffed - I wanted to see PINK perform, she was 9 and it was in a city 4 hours away, and it was my daughter's first concert, and I wanted to be there for that. But once I put my own wishes aside it was too good an offer to turn down. I do still think it's a shame I wasn't there for my daughter's first concert experience, but I can be glad she got to go.", "They may not have the money saved up for the trip yet. Even at the reduced cost it's still a huge amount of money, especially at short notice.", "If OP can manage to be a gracious travel companion, they should all go. You\u2019re right, OP and wife are being saved a chunk of expense so why not go together? Our son and DIL were talking last year about starting to plan to take our grandkids for their first time. We asked if we could tag along, making it clear that they should feel free to say No. But they were sweet enough to say they thought it would be fun \u2014 and it was. We surprised them by picking up the flights and hotel $ and as you suggested, we took the kids sometimes so the parents could have alone time, and we also made sure to give them all alone time together while we did stuff on our own. It was great fun to all go together and I urge OP to consider making this a special family trip \u2014 especially given FIL\u2019s dire health, for crying out loud! And if he\u2019s not willing to do this, at least let the poor man have this great experience with the kids.", "His wife's dad is dying. She just wants them to spend some time with her dad and create some special memories. If OP really wants to suck it up, he would let his wife go with the kids. Maybe the airplane tickets just for her wouldn't be that much, she can bunk with the kids and her parents and usually on Disney trips the park tickets are pretty much thrown in is my understanding and she would also get to spend some time with her dad before he passes.", "Not to mention arranging annual leave and work cover etc would 1000 times easier", "My husband got lost in every single one of the Disney parks when he was like 10 ,  he was/still is a wanderer and your story reminded me of that. :)", "You believe OP isn't omitting any details to make himself look less shitty?

What possible reason does he have to NOT be happy about it!??? \n\nDisney is magical regardless if it\u2019s with your dad or not. This should be about the kids and the grandpa, not about dad at all. What am I not getting here, or is the comments just full of a bunch of helicopter parents with bad relationships with their kids??? \n\nThe only comments I can understand which are \u201cthe other side\u201d are about the logistics of having two elderly folks in charge of two young ones at Disney. The crowds, the heat, it\u2019ll be tough - that makes sense as a criticism. \n\nBut about informing dad or involving dad just cuz his little feelings would be hurt if he wasn\u2019t sharing their \u201cfirst\u201d? Get over it. \n\nI don\u2019t get his perspective at all and I bet his wife doesn\u2019t either. I don\u2019t care if my kid has his firsts with his grandparents, because that just enriches his life, not detracts from it. In fact my son\u2019s nanny is the one who did most of his firsts with him - and I\u2019m just super happy we got such an involved nanny! Why would I want to deprive my own child of an experience just because it\u2019s not with me??? How selfish or insecure of a mother would that make me?!? \n\nNot everything has to be about the parents. And frankly if you\u2019re the type of parent that just has to be there for all your kid\u2019s firsts, you\u2019re either controlling as hell, or you use experiences as a manipulative way to gain love.

There is something special about the first time, so you are not wrong to be upset. It's your wife who is in the wrong here. She should have run it past you and then all the adults could work together to see if there is a way for the whole family to go. But, it's a very difficult time and was thoughtless,  not malicious.  I don't really understand why grandparents don't want you and your wife there. It's going to be fun, but also hard work, especially when grandad is ill. I would be more concerned about that than missing out. If there's no way the grandparents can help out financially for you all to go, you are just going to have to accept it. I would ask everyone to include you in plans before tell8ng the children in future.", "NTA. I totally agree with you!

Both parents should agree or it\u2019s a firm no. It is not safe.

I don\u2019t get the concept of building memories. It is so alien to me. I think it is presumptuous of your in-laws to use your children for some weird gain for themselves. Your kids will remember their grandfather with or without Disney. And how and why we remember Someone is not dependent on a specific thing we did with that person. \n\nYour wife clearly is TA (even so I can see where she is coming from). A decision like that should always be made by both parents.", "ESH\n\nTake yourself out of the equation and think of your children. You are being selfish.

She also earns the \u201cA\u201d badge.\n\nAnd your FIL and MIL\u2026 you say he was diagnosed in July\u2026 it\u2019s December now. What does his oncologist say about this trip? They are planning on February\u2026? He\u2019s what\u2026 50-60 yrs old, diagnosed 5 months ago with metastatic cancer that they are no longer treating? What is the contingency plan if he has a medical emergency during the trip? Who takes care of the children? MIL will need (and want) to be there for FIL. So that begs my second question:\n\n2. How will your FIL\u2019s illness and limitations affect \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8e on this trip? As ill as he may be, unless he\u2019s thought all this out and has plans in place should something happen, he\u2019s a lesser \u201cA\u201d too.

But we went as many places as we could. She started falling a lot, so we would request wheelchairs. We would hold her up constantly. But she still \u201cstumbled.\u201d Her attitude was incredible! And we were grateful for the memories\u2026\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t a child of 5 or 6. This trip might be terrifying and potentially traumatizing for one or both of them.

The wife *offhandedly* offered to go with the in-laws despite \"we\u2019ve always said we\u2019ve wanted to get to experience taking them and seeing their faces\", meaning the initial plan was for OP and wife to not go with them at all.

In August of his last year we booked a trip for December, because he seemed to be doing so well. He could have done a Disney trip that August. Then he took a sudden turn for the worse and died in October. The change in his condition was rapid and dramatic. Some types of cancer tend to spread to the brain after chemo is stopped, so it can affect their reasoning and judgement, which is what happened in my spouse\u2019s case.

It's a selfish act. \n\nIt's incredibly likely that the entire reason the trip was proposed, was because OP and his wife have brought up how they expect to take this trip once they save up money for it.

It's just an odd thing for an unhealthy dying person to propose otherwise. \n\nDying grandfather thought it was a great idea and is swooping in to steal it. He has money to burn because he won't need it soon. On top of stealing the idea for the proposed dream vacation, given the children's ages it will likely be their first memory of a real vacation. Probably their first memory of being on an airplane. Saying it will be just as \"magical\" the second time is a whole giant heaping crock of bullshit. It's not even remotely true. \n\nAll that said, I wouldn't necessarily call the grandfather the AH because he did discuss it with his daughter. It's tough to fault him for wanting to do this. The real blame lies with the daughter who should have brought this up with OP, her husband. There is not one single good reason to not discuss a decision this major with your spouse. There is nothing pleasantly surprising about this for OP. Now OP is stuck. With it being announced over Christmas, he can't take it back or the kids will forever resent him.
