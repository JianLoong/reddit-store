They\u2019re both super into princesses and all that. We\u2019ve talked about taking them to Disney over the next few years as we know they\u2019d love it. My wife has never been before, and I\u2019ve only been once- when I was 10 years old. It was definitely a memorable trip for me as my family had to save up a while for it. We\u2019ve always known that Disney would be our big trip with our girls.\n\nIn July, my FIL got diagnosed with prostate cancer. After a few rounds of chemo and some rather intense stays at the hospital, it\u2019s only gotten worse. It\u2019s spread across to other organs in his body, and rather than trying to suffer to fight it, he\u2019s opted to just not do chemo and try to live with what time he has left. As a result, him and my MIL have decided to make more memories with family. One of these memories is to take our daughters to Disney & surprised them with the trip yesterday during Christmas.\n\nAt first, I thought my wife would be against it as well- we\u2019ve always said we\u2019ve wanted to get to experience taking them and seeing their faces. However, I found out that my MIL cleared it with my wife last month. My wife didn\u2019t tell me because she thought I would be surprised and excited for our daughters. I sat through all of the rest of the night, but when we got home we had a serious discussion about it.\n\nI told my wife that I didn\u2019t want our daughters first trip to Disney to be without us. She suggested we go along, but the trip is in February, and booking flights+hotel+tickets for just my wife and I for the time they\u2019re all going is still going to be almost $5000. I told my wife that we have to talk to her parents & decline the trip, but my wife is saying that I\u2019m being selfish and heartless by robbing our daughters of this experience & robbing them of a core memory with my FIL before he passes. Am I being out of line here?", "created_utc": 1672084228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvv77q/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_in_laws_taking_our_kids/", "score": 538, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife is right. I understand your disappointment in not being the first to take your kids to Disney, but these are special circumstance. Their grandfather/your wife's father is dying and wants to create memories with his grandchildren that will last once he is gone. It's small minded and selfish to take that opportunity away from him and your children just so you can be the first to have the experience with them. Do you think if you do this your wife and daughter's won't resent you for what you are taking away from them to satisfy your own selfish need. If you do this remember someday your daughter's will be adults and think about how they will look back on this and what they will think about you.", "YTA. Don\u2019t take this incredibly thoughtful and meaningful gift away from your children, especially when it is a chance to create some core memories with a grandfather who doesn\u2019t have much longer to live. Take it from someone whose grandfather also died when I was young, these are the kinds of memories they will cherish. \n\nIt would be incredibly selfish to take this away from your children, and also from your wife - this is her father who is dying and she probably wants this for your kids more than you know. \n\nEither figure out how to make this trip work, or take them again when you can afford it. Guaranteed they will love a return trip, and likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten to see all of it the first time, so it will still be a magical experience", "Okay, I\u2019m going against the tide here, but I can\u2019t see an easy judgement. Your in-laws are not TA. They asked and were granted the opportunity. I can actually see your perspective - I would want to be there to experience my child\u2019s first trip to Disney too. However, you and your wife have exhibited poor judgment. She ABSOLUTELY should not have agreed to this without your input, that is not acceptable. My only thought is that she\u2019s too focused on making her father\u2019s last days joyful to consider all angles. You have been presented with a tough situation, but are more focused on your own feelings than those of everyone involved. The problem is, your in-laws and children are blameless in this, and it will not go well for you to yank this opportunity out from under them. However, I would like to point out another issue - have they really thought this through? They\u2019re two people of somewhat advanced age, one of whom has terminal cancer and is doing chemo, and they want to chase two insanely hyped up young children around Disney for however long?! You and your wife really need to try to find a way to go, because I don\u2019t see that ending well for them!", "YTA, drive to florida if you want to be there.", "That grandparent has a very limited time....", "YTA- big time. That is extremely selfish of you.", "Probably unpopular opinion: ESH. \n\nYou are reacting poorly. I get that this is a memory that you want to be able to make with your children and for it to be a once in a lifetime first. \n\nYour wife and in laws absolutely should not have hid this from you. Yes he has limited time, that is not a reason to cut you out of parenting decisions.", "YTA. \n\nCome on man....give a dying man and his wife a great memory. You could always take your kids another time.", "YTA.  Vetoing the gift of some final memories about their grandfather to your children because you want to go is selfish beyond belief.", "YTA. I understand some people see Disney World as some sort of \u201cMilestone\u201d in family travel but in all reality, it\u2019s just a theme park. Your FIL is going to pass soon, wouldn\u2019t you want your daughters to remember him as \u201cThe most awesome grandpa who took us to Disney World\u201d when he passes? You are taking away a potential memory not only from your daughter but from your dying FIL. You should be over the moon that someone wants to pay to take your kids somewhere that expensive.", "Yes you are out of line.  I had a trip to Disney planned for my family including my parents when mom was diagnosed with cancer. She was so upset at the thought of missing the trip because she had gone with all the other grands and thought she was going to miss it with my youngest. She made the trip and it was our last big family vacation since my mom and husband died a couple of years later. Take the time, spend the money, make the memories. It's worth the sacrifices.  Don't be an AH.", "YTA. Your FIL is trying to make a special memory with his granddaughters before he passes away. Your wanting to be with them for their first Disney trip is not nearly as important as his last few months of life. Suck it up and let them have fun with their grandkids.", "YTA it isn\u2019t about you, you are beyond selfish.  I pity your family", "YTA. \n\nEither suck up the cost and go or let them go. Your FIL is dying for fucks sake", "Seems like opinions are all over and I'm voting NTA.  You don't say how far but I wouldn't let my kids at that age go without one parent.", "YTA. If grandpa weren't sick, I MIGHT side with you. I completely understand that a trip to Disney is expensive, we can't afford to take our kids, and my 5 yo loves the princesses. But Grandpa won't be around for much longer. Give him and your children this memory.  I went to Disney with my grandparents and it's one of my favorite memories with my grandpa. If I went with my parents it wouldn't rank in my top 10 favorite memories. \n\nSide story, my sister took her kids a couple years ago and when they got back they said it was fun, but they would have had more fun at a water park. \n\nI understand what you are feeling, but let your kids have this memory.", "If you are that worried about firsts then make sure to take them during a different time of year. Disney at Halloween or Disney at Christmas is a totally different experience that they can enjoy too. Perhaps don\u2019t look at this as not being there for their firsts so much as it is allowing them to be there for Grandpas last.", "Holy shit YTA.", "YTA. Someone is dying man\u2026", "YTA The gift is for your daughters not you. They already know so know you gonna tell them no. Also HE IS DYING! Get over yourself.", "YTA. Your wife is right, you're being selfish. I understand you want to go to Disney with them, and you will in the years to come. Your FIL won't have that opportunity. I lost my FIL to cancer a few years back and I couldn't imagine telling him he couldn't do something special with his grandkids because I wanted to be first. This isn't about you. It's about your kids and your FIL.", "YTA. Maybe you can take comfort from knowing that children NEVER get blas\u00e9 about Disney, and there is just no way they will see all there is to see in one trip. In a couple of years more, from a different perspective, they will still be just as joyous at the thought of going to Disney.", "YTA\n\nYou're being selfish and heartless. Yes your wife should have cleared it with you but she didn't and she's apologised. \n\nTake the time in February to be with your wife and appreciate her. She's noble enough to send her kids to Disney with her parents when they never bothered to take her.\n\nYet you've made the trip all about you. Shame shame shame", "YTA, and slightly, your wife. \n\n\nShe should have told you. You aren't a child and a Disney trip wasn't really a Christmas morning surprise but she may have guessed you'd behave ungratefully and try to get out of it. \n\n\nThis might be granddads only trip with his grandkids. I get it you had plans for some unspecified future time but life gets in the way. He is severely ill enough that choosing to stop treatment and enjoy his remaining time was the best option and now you want to deny him the joy of taking his grandchildren on an experience that you acknowledge they'll love? \n\n\nYour kids are too young to have many memories of FIL that will stick, this may be their big chance at a wonderful memory and may be a last hurrah together for MIL and FIL. If the tickets to go along are too expensive then maybe ask them to help you join or just do flights and share a hotel room with your kids? There are some options here.", "What is the acronym of the whole new level of YTA? Because that's what you are, OP.\n\nYou wanted to see your kids' faces in Disney, but then you wine how much it cost to book the flights and hotel for you and your wife. What's wrong with you?!\n\nI can't even blame your wife for not telling you about the in-laws' plan, because what kind of person would object to such idea?! Of-course she was caught completely off-guard by your reaction. She is learning a lot about you in this situation. She may just learn enough to divorce you.", "NTA\n\nIt would be different if you and your wife had never spoken about this, or if you had never told her how important it was to you...but you did. I'm incredibly sorry your FIL is dying, but that doesn't mean he gets to have an experience you've been looking forward to. There are TONS of other places they could have taken the kids that don't have the emotional pull that Disney has for you: Universal, Legoland, hell, they could even do a Disney Cruise or an Adventures by Disney trip if it *had* to be Disney. \n\nI won't say they're assholes, because they asked your wife; if anything, they and the kids are the pawns/victims here of the only real AH, your wife. I get she's losing her father, but she doesn't get to ignore your wants and needs in the process.\n\nGiven that she WAS TA here, though, I'd suggest telling the ILs that the kids can only go if you can, too--not just so you get your memories, but also because someone dying of cancer should not be primarily responsible for grandchildren.", "YTA. Sometimes in life you need to make concessions due to circumstances beyond your control. This is one of them. Why would you dig your heels in when your wife is going to lose her father and your kids are going to lose their grandfather. And soon. Stop it. Now. And there are other memories you can make at a trillion other places around the globe.", "Esh.  Your wife should of cleared taking the children out of state with you.  I'd be pretty pissed if my in-laws pulled this.  But, the man does not have long to live.  You will get another chance to go.  I think you should let them go with some grace and enjoy time alone with your wife.", "YTA nobody is promised tomorrow who's to say you will be around to take them to Disney later.", "NAH \u2026 just a lack of communication during an emotional time and the future months are going to be even harder as your FIL, MIL, wife and daughters grapple with the pain of your FILs illness. Right now you have this opportunity to be an incredible man for your family. It\u2019s not just experiencing the fun once in a lifetime vacations that will mean the most to your kids and wife \u2026 enabling your family to build this memory with your FIL will last them a life time \u2026 and you have the ability to contribute to that experience. \n\nSo get in gear and start figuring out ways to contribute in a positive / meaningful way \u2026 with your in-laws potentially paying for at least some of the cost for your kids, research the rest. Figure out how to pay for you and your wife to get there too.", "YTA.  The parks will still be there after your FIL passes away.   Just take them on their second trip in the future.  And you can make it as memorable as you want it to be.  Don\u2019t be selfish and grant a dying man his final wish.", "NTA. There are plenty of other places they could go.  Doesn\u2019t have to be Disney.", "YTA", "I\u2019m seeing a lot of Y T A verdicts but i don\u2019t agree with that. Your wife didn\u2019t but should have discussed with you and she didn\u2019t. She sucks for that. Your in-laws should have discussed with you both, not just her, so they suck for that. You get to feel how you want to feel about it, and while you would kind of suck to not let them go, i would react the same way you have. My MIL stole my kids Xmas morning from me and my husband (if you want to peruse my recent post), and I\u2019m going NC with her as soon as i get back to our country of origin. \n\nIdk if i have a verdict but you should try to go.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA because that way of thinking is why I\u2019ve never gone to Disney. My mother said no to multiple sets of grandparents taking me because \u201cit should be a family trip and my mom wanted to watch me experience it\u201d. Well guess what, my mom never found the right time to go. And now I\u2019m almost 30 wondering if I could ever experience the \u201cdisney magic\u201d.", "Would you feel differently if it were YOUR parents? \ud83e\uddd0", "YTA along with your wife. You\u2019re prioritizing your own feelings/interests over everyone else\u2019s, including your children.

By the time you can afford it, he may not be around. Your kids are young!

You have many years to do \u201cfirsts\u201d with your daughters. Your FIL does not have that much time. \n\nLet them have this, and be sure to ask to see the pictures and souvenirs when they get back.", "This goes past YTA, there\u2019s so many choice words I would like to use for you but I\u2019d hate to be banned. You are being selfish, selfish to your daughters and fil.", "YTA.\n\nThe guy is dying, ffs.\n\nIf you stop the kids from going on the trip with their grandfather, and they discover you had a hand in preventing them from doing this before losing their grandfather (and they WILL discover it at some point), they will never forgive you.\n\nJust let it go, send them on the trip and you can go at a later date.", "Unpopular opinion NTA. It\u2019s wrong on so many levels to not consult both parents before booking something like this. It is NOT the right of a grandparent to take away the opportunity of a parent to share this experience with their children. The best and only way that trip should have happened or been planned was with both parents input and parents being included on the trip as well so they could all make memories together. I understand that the grandfather does not have long left but that does not give him the right to take away the parents chance of memories with their own dang kids. There are a dozen ways he could make memories with his grandkids that don\u2019t involve robbing the actual parents of first time experiences.", "YTA. Listen to your wife.", "YTA\u2014 you\u2019re going to get lots of fun times with them, why not let him have this one? They won\u2019t love grandpa more than you because they have this one nice memory with him. \n\nAnd Disney is nice and all that but it\u2019s not this big of a deal. My 7 year old goes on and on about all sorts of things I didn\u2019t think were the exciting moments of our lives and doesn\u2019t even remember some of the most expensive orchestrated ones. \n\nAnd when you do go in a few years with the girls, they will be different, they won\u2019t be saying \u201cwe need to do the Dumbo ride because that\u2019s what we did with grandpa!\u201d they\u2019ll be more interested in the Star Wars stuff or something.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife is the AH here.

And I'm curious why the parents are willing to spend for themselves and kids but not help you all join?", "NTA your il's are being selfish.

It\u2019s so wrong of your wife to not discuss this with you. The obvious thing which would have made everyone happy was for everyone to go together and their poor planning has made that impossible. Just because someone is dying doesn\u2019t stop them being an asshole. If he wasn\u2019t dying everyone else would overwhelmingly be an asshole so adding in the dying part doesn\u2019t negate that. You\u2019re now in a really tough spot and I don\u2019t know the solution. However, you\u2019re not wrong for your feelings and I think you and your wife could maybe use a session with a therapist to work through it because I can see this building extreme resentment on all sides. However, be assured the grandparents are going to regret going alone after about an hour because it\u2019s exhausting AF and they are not going to have the energy to keep up with those kids and really give them a great experience.\nEdit - sorry I just have to emphasise what a stupid stupid plan this was for the grandparents and anyone who had ever been to Disney would know two old people (one very sick) are absolutely not going to be able to hack looking after two young kids at the parks on their own.", "[removed]", "Here's the thing: it's not going to be a core memory at that age.

That will not go over well.", "Esh, but your wife marginally more than you.", "ESH  \nThis is such a tough situation but ultimately I think it's an ESH (the everyone really being You and Your Wife). I do mildly agree with, what is the majority of comments on this post are saying, here saying YTA for wanting to take away the memories from your kids and PILs. What sucks mostly though is the fact that this was not discussed with all relevant parties before booking it. This feels rushed and deliberately done to subvert you in some capacity. There are so many ways this could have been managed so that A. You were involved in the decision making, and B. so you and your wife could also go with them. When was this trip booked? I bet it was at a time that tickets were not around $5000 for two adults as the earlier you book, generally, the cheaper things can end up being.   \n\n\nUnfortunately what's done is done though, and I feel like you don't have much choice other than saying either that they can go, or fork out the 5K and go with them. I do also agree with the sentiment of another comment - are your PILs in a state to acompany two hyped up young kids to Disney? That more than most else is something you should all really consider.", "I\u2019m going with YTA but I also understand this is still rather fresh and new. Yes your kids will have fun and you may not be able to financially swing the trip right now. However, as a family that JUST went to Disney this year with kids 8 and 11, you can still plan to take them again in a few years. They are too young and likely too small to do a lot of Disney activities. They can certainly soak in the princess stuff and smaller kid Disney things, but many rides and attractions are designated with older kids and adults in mind. Take them again in a few years when they meet all height requirements and they can do an entire new side of Disney they won\u2019t do this year with grandparents. Best of both worlds. They get the memories with grandfather, and he has something good to relive in what is likely final months, and you and wife have a new experience with the kids in a few years as well.", "ESH. Your wife should have absolutely run a multi-night vacation for your kids by you before agreeing. There\u2019s definitely some logistics I\u2019d want considered.

Your girls will enjoy every trip to Disney- and it\u2019s a massive park. They won\u2019t be able to experience everything on the first trip, trust me. There are also new exhibits all the time. They\u2019re also extremely young and to be very honest, this is as much a trip for the grandparents as it is for them. They\u2019re so young they won\u2019t remember it all that well, but the grandparents will relish every minute with them at the park and it\u2019ll be one of the last good things your FIL gets to experience with them. In short, take them again sometime. It won\u2019t subtract anything from the experience if they go once with their grandparents before one of them passes away.

They\u2019re both super into princesses and all that. We\u2019ve talked about taking them to Disney over the next few years as we know they\u2019d love it. My wife has never been before, and I\u2019ve only been once- when I was 10 years old. It was definitely a memorable trip for me as my family had to save up a while for it. We\u2019ve always known that Disney would be our big trip with our girls.\n\nIn July, my FIL got diagnosed with prostate cancer. After a few rounds of chemo and some rather intense stays at the hospital, it\u2019s only gotten worse. It\u2019s spread across to other organs in his body, and rather than trying to suffer to fight it, he\u2019s opted to just not do chemo and try to live with what time he has left. As a result, him and my MIL have decided to make more memories with family. One of these memories is to take our daughters to Disney & surprised them with the trip yesterday during Christmas.\n\nAt first, I thought my wife would be against it as well- we\u2019ve always said we\u2019ve wanted to get to experience taking them and seeing their faces. However, I found out that my MIL cleared it with my wife last month. My wife didn\u2019t tell me because she thought I would be surprised and excited for our daughters. I sat through all of the rest of the night, but when we got home we had a serious discussion about it.\n\nI told my wife that I didn\u2019t want our daughters first trip to Disney to be without us. She suggested we go along, but the trip is in February, and booking flights+hotel+tickets for just my wife and I for the time they\u2019re all going is still going to be almost $5000. I told my wife that we have to talk to her parents & decline the trip, but my wife is saying that I\u2019m being selfish and heartless by robbing our daughters of this experience & robbing them of a core memory with my FIL before he passes. Am I being out of line here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "they're only 6 and 5, odds are they'll completely forget this trip by the time they're 10 or so, if you want to take them again, then, and they'll be older, so they'll get to enjoy Disney again in a whole different way. They'll have more energy to walk around and see the sights, instead of now, when they'll probably get tired and overwhelmed quickly, plus your FIL and MIL are much older than you, right? so they'll also get tired quickly, especially FIL, who's sick.\n\nHonestly, I get you're hurt and taken by surprise and feel like you were put on the spot by this, but you're better off. Let them go, now, with FIL who won't be here in the future, and keep saving to take them again in a couple of years. Trust me, they'll enjoy it as if it were the first time they've been there.", "Let your in-laws have this one. Your MIL and your wife will remember it forever. Your kids will not. They are too young.\n\nYou can take them again in a few years and experience Disney with them like it's the first time.", "When you take your family to Disney they will have the fun to see your excitement.", "I\u2019m going against most of the answers but NAH \nYou want to be the one to take them for the first time and I get that. It\u2019ll be a memorable moment and you should experience that \nBut your fil doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left and wants to leave knowing he had a special memory with his granddaughters really I don\u2019t think anyone is necessarily wrong but this really should\u2019ve been a discussion with all 4 of you from the start", "Yes you are the asshole..If you have to ask then you know..", "Nta your wife is the ah for this. It\u2019s a big trip and to not even talk about it maybe you all could of went who knows how much energy the fil has and young kids can be a lot of work. His wife put him in a shit situation without speaking to him. Like could this all of been sorted out maybe if husband was short some money they could of borrowed from his in laws to cover some of them to make it one big trip together", "YTA.\n\nyour FIL has a LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME and the FIRST to take them is more important than them going and making memories with a dying man?\n\nWhen would you have the money for ALL of you to go? 3 years from now with proper savings?", "NAH   \n\nI'm sure I'll be down voted into oblivion but whatever.  My husband lost his mother to ovarian cancer in 2016 and like your FIL, she declined treatment and made the most of what time she had left.  He lost his father in summer 2020 from heart failure.  Again, we knew it was coming and had time to day goodbye.  Both times, his parents (they were divorced from each other and married to other people) wanted to have big make memories type of things.  Both times, my husband communicated with me about what he wanted and what his parents wanted.  Then he asked me to tell him what I felt was reasonable for our family.  His brothers did they same with their respective families and we made it work.  Communication is key.  Always.\n\nWhen we thought we would lose my dad last year he wanted what he wanted and I communicated to my husband what that was, what it looked like for me and what would be best for our family.  \n\nI'm baffled by everyone saying how selfish you are.  Yes, her father is dying.  Yes, it's a horrible thing to go through.  Yes, it changes perspective on what you thought was important and what it turns out is important.  Communication still matters.  OP's feelings matter. OPs wife's feelings matter.  His in law's feelings matter.  This is just a shitty situation but I remember taking my kids to Disney for the first time and age absolutely can matter for a lot of it.  \n\nGood luck OP.  I wish peace and healing for your family and peace for your FIL.  Also, fuck cancer.", "YTA. Normally, I would agree. But when a grandparent is dying, things change. Please try to find a way to go with them. This would be a core memory for your wife, too - getting to experience Disney with her dad before he dies.", ">Am I being out of line here?\n\nYes, you are. YTA. Your wife is absolutely right. Don't make this any more difficult than it already is for her, her parents and your kids that will soon be missing their grandpa.", "ESH, except for the grandparents. Like, your wife really should have communicated this to you in advance as 5-6 really is not really prime Disney age in regards to parentless travel. At their age/height, there is going to need to be dialogue in advance about what rides they will not be able to go on due to height requirements, what each child will have energy for, and what exactly is feasible to prevent disappointment. Planning this as early as possible by setting expectations reduces the likelihood of tantrums, or a 6 year old running off and her grandparents losing sight of her (I could outrun my grandparents at age 4, this is not unheard of). Talking the trip through with them and ensuring that the girls aren't too burnt out by the end is necessary. The waiting to tell you is the part that is upsetting to me, because it's setting everyone up for failure.\n\nThat being said, sometimes first happen and you can't be a part of them. That shouldn't be the priority right now my guy.", "To me, you're NTA. I would never let my kids go with someone else, even grandparents, for that experience. We are going next week and I have been working to make it happen for them for months. \n\nIn-laws are NTA, but their motives are selfish; they should have included parents. \n\nYour wife sucks. She knew, agreed to this, and kept it from you and now faults you for being unhappy. \n\nMaybe you don't know - Disney is a huge undertaking for kids and their caretakers. It's fun, but it's overstimulating and exhausting. I would not think that a sick grandparent is up to it alone, let alone with very little kids and no parents. \n\nI would make whatever needed to happen to join the trip; wife needs to step up to make this happen now that kids know.", "YTA. \n\nYou're thinking about yourself, not your kids. Selfish.", "YTA Death is always the trump card.", "ESH. I think how you handled it was wrong. I think your wife should have keyed you in before saying yes. I think since your FIL is sick I\u2019d let them go seeing as you will have many firsts.", "YTA The man is dying and he wants to make special memories with your daughters that they will hopefully remember. You are being selfish and only thinking of yourself. Disney is more fun for the kids when they are older and can ride all the rides. You will be able to take them as many times as you want in the future but their grandfather won\u2019t be able too.", "YTA and being selfish", "I\u2019d be inclined to say ESH if you were upset about her not clearing an out-of-state trip for the kids without you guys or something, but you only seem concerned about the whole \u201cfirst trip to Disney\u201d thing. So like.. YTA here, friend.\n\nSeriously, there are a ton of alternatives to shelling out 5K for travel expenses and accommodations. Depending on where you live, there\u2019s always the option of just road tripping it. I\u2019ve lived in south Alabama all my life, and people from the whole ass opposite side of the country drive through the area headed to Disney all the time (I know this because they tend to run in and out of the gas stations around here while excitedly talking about how close they are lol it\u2019s super sweet). You also don\u2019t have to book a vacation package with reservations in the on-site hotels since there are a ton of hotels close by (and several within walking distance). I know that\u2019s still a lot of work and cash on your part, esp depending on where you\u2019d be traveling from, but you\u2019d be surprised how easy it is to knock a lot off the price tag when you plan it all on your own without using a travel agent or booking one of Disney\u2019s vacation packages.\n\nIn any case, please don\u2019t be a dick and take this away from your kids or their grandparents purely because you wanted to be the one to take them on their first Disney trip. From the sound of things in your post, it\u2019s likely that their grandfather won\u2019t be able to go on another Disney trip at all. Let your kids go and make memories with their grandparents while they\u2019re able, dude. Shit, just do some research and crunch some numbers and figure out a way to get down there WITH them so you can ALL make the memories together. And then when you and your wife take them on the next trip, look at their faces when they talk about those memories.\n\nIt\u2019ll be fucking WORTH IT. Way more than just being able to say you took them first.", "If it's that important to you to see your kids first trip then make the money work. But don't take away the trip from the kids. \n\nWe would go to Disney with my fil, he's gone now. But I'd pay anything to go on another trip with him and the kids.", "You want to tell your dying father in law he can\u2019t take his grandkids to Disney before he dies and tell your kids they can\u2019t go on a trip to Disney they\u2019re now fully aware of, and you\u2019re really not sure you\u2019re the asshole? \n\nYou may be thinking they\u2019ll forgive you in a few months because they\u2019re young, but when they\u2019re old enough to realize the memories you took away from them with their deceased grandfather, your relationship with your daughters will be irrevocably damaged.\n\nObviously YTA.", "It was wrong of your wife to agree to this idea without discussing it with you.  You certainly have a right to be the ones taking your own kids to Disney.   \n\n\nHowever, this is kind of an unusual circumstance.  At this age, the kids will not remember much about a trip.  You could take them when they are a few years older and they will remember a lot more.  Do you really want to deny your FIL when he is dying?  It\u2019s not like he can wait and go later?\n\nI\u2019m not sure that anyone is an AH.  It\u2019s just a choice.  Keep in mind also how this decision  might affect your wife since she is losing her father.  Maybe the decision is to go with them even if it is expensive.", "NTA for reacting as you did. Your wife should have discussed this with you - very TA of her to keep that from you. If your FIL is experiencing any weakness, low energy, symptoms that could impact his participation in the trip, I would be concerned about them going with the in-laws. Also - some people just don\u2019t want their children to take long trips without them. I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t live in the state or country where the vacation will be, so if anything were to go wrong, you would not be close by.", "YTA your wife is right.

Your wife - his daughter - is on board with it. Only your wounded pride (because you can\u2019t afford it) and your own selfishness is standing in the way. \n\nAlso, why argue over this with your wife at time when she\u2019s likely struggling with anticipatory grief over the eventual death of her Dad?\n\nETA: I lost both of my grandfathers at a young age. I wish I had more memories of them both, because I adored them. I would\u2019ve been so mad to grow up and learn my father had denied me an amazing experience with them, simply because he was jealous he couldn\u2019t afford to take me himself.", "ESH. Or at least, both you and your SO suck. I'm assuming your in-laws checked with your wife under the assumption she'd check with you.\n\nYou're being selfish, not only to your in-laws, one of which is dying from cancer, but to your daughters, by denying them a chance to create memories with their grandfather before he is no more. That's not at all unlikely to ferment into pretty serious resentment towards you in the future, which will weigh a lot more than the happy memories you *might* create by taking them to Disneyland yourself in a few years.\n\nThe cat (i.e. the gift) is out of the bag, and you can't put o it back in without being an AH, even if taking the cat or of the bag was an AH move towards you.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019ve been to Disney 4 or 5 times throughout my life, and by far my most meaningful trip was the last one my family went on before my uncle died. I\u2019m eternally grateful that my family made that specific trip happen. Even though he was super sick, it was the last time I got to see him *really* out and about, enjoying a place he loved with the people he loved.\n\nWhile I totally get wanting their first trip to be with you and your wife, this should be an exception. The perfect solution would be everyone going together, but if it isn\u2019t financially possible (as you discussed in the post) then the next best thing would be allowing the kids to go. \n\nWhat better memory to have as one of your last with a grandparent? Disney is special every time you go, no matter who you go with. Your future trips with them will still be special, and you guys *will* have opportunities for future trips.

It sucks to be in that position because 1) you were out of town 2) they knew that was something special you wanted to do. I understand the grandpa has cancer and that\u2019s very unfortunate, but for no one to have an adult discussion with the father of said children is wild to me. The wife knew what he would think and I bet you big money if they had a discussion about it they could\u2019ve come up with a way to do it all together.

Her trying to hide it and play it off as \"I thought u would be happy for them\" is total bullshit.  She hid it because she knew he wouldn't like it.

I was torn between NAH/ESH. This is a huge moment and a very special trip and I can understand where OP is coming from. OP's wife is grieving and so I don't blame her but this is not a one parent decision. \n\nI think if the grandparents were going to make that offer, they should have offered to cover OP and his wife.

They never took their own daughter to Disney but somehow it\u2019s *so* important for them to take OP\u2019s kids? They can 100% go somewhere else", "The only mistake is OP not letting them go, FIL is literally terminal. It\u2019s selfish to not agree. If any other person involved grew to resent OP over this decision it would be valid. Disney doesn\u2019t get less exciting if a kid\u2019s already been, Disney is always changing and always exciting.

It's pretty much impossible to see the entire park in one day, too, so OP can get plenty of new magical moments with the kids on their second time there.", "Also what they get out of it will change as they get older.\n\nRight now it's probably all about princesses. When they're a little older and bigger it maybe all about the rides they can now ride.", "It also might be a bit sweet to have them be their parents 'tour guides' when they can all go together", "So they're going to pay AND take the kids for a week AND he won't have to Disney with princess-crazed, overexcited, and overtired kids? \n\nAnd he's upset about this?!", "Yes, she could have discussed it with OP", "Agreed. I\u2019m going for the 15th time in January and it never loses its charm. \nNot to mention, for every time I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve had different experiences and made wonderful memories.

I\u2019ve never actually been, but it\u2019s a giant theme park, yes? Every theme park I\u2019ve been to 9-10 would be a much more appropriate and fun age to take the kids. 5-6 would get tired, over stimulated and cranky pretty fast, couldn\u2019t go on a lot of the rides, and would have much less patience for waiting in lines.

OP lost the exact core moment he wanted to make with his children. That is huge. People dream of taking their kids to Disney 'someday'. For someone else to just sweep in and take that moment...that blows.\n\nI get why he's pissed. Life isn't fair. OP's feelings are valid. His feelings aren't bigger than grandpa being sick, but they are valid.", "So agree. My parents took me for my 16th birthday, I remember every moment & I'll always have that memory of being with my parents.\n\nThey apparently took me to visit my aunt in another country when I was 6 and I don't remember any of that lol", "That's how I'm feeling about it. Not just energy, but what if there is a medical emergency? We've now got two little kids without a primary caregiver. If FIL needs to go to the hospital due to issues, where does that leave the kids and MIL with no additional support.

It's so selfish and gross.", "In law probably expected that wife and OP would have discussed it and been on the same page.", "If she had told him a month earlier, they would have faced cheaper booking options and could have prepared the finances to tag along better.", "She should have discussed it first regardless of what she assumed he would say. I think she knew OP would say no so she surprised him along with the kids so he couldn't say no.", "They talked to spouse only. A decision that would have included BOTH parents as it pertains to THEIR children, not just hers. Be it maliciously or innocently, they hid it. They purposely withheld information.", "That\u2019s quite a leap to make. Nothing suggests that", "Exactly. \n\nOP does not seem to care about his FIL or his daughters.", "Oh that too, absolutely!", "This is a \u201cgift\u201d that never should have been approved without both parents (since they are married) approving.  Wife was wrong to do that.  I can see why dad is salty.", "The GPs asked their daughter, the mom. I\u2019m sure they figured that their daughter would discuss it with OP.", "And if FIL wasn't dying all of the you would be saying N TA and talking about how horrible the ILs are and how they're over stepping. Is he even going to be healthy enough for this trip? They should have definitely purchased tickets for the parents as well so that they'd have that help. Really they could have done anything else with their granddaughters why did it have to be Disney... something many families save for? They're behaving selfishly and using FIL help to do so.", "Well I understand. I know $5000 is not easy to get. But I\u2019m just wondering for context because wife and parents seem to think it\u2019s not an issue.", "Plus it changes constantly. I worked their first years and every-time I go back there is something new.", "Agreed, I'm in the UK and have been to Disneyland Paris a few times. First time as a child it was all about the characters, as a teenager it was about the rides, went back a few years ago as an adult and my focus (apart from rides) was the food and all the small little details that are hidden in plain sight all over the place.", "And who knows how much they will actually remember from this trip besides the fact it might be a last core memory with their grandpa.", "Because taking your kids is pure magic. I would have been heartbroken to have my kids go without me. I was tired, cranky and definitely done with Disney at times but it was also the best time of my entire life and memories I will treasure forever.", "No, she's thinking of her dying father and his relationship with her kids. OP is thinking of himself and their relationship with their kids. No one is being totally selfish, other than the wife for making a unilateral decision about a major vacation without talking with OP.

Probably it would be less expensive.", "Disney is a lot of walking and standing in lines and having two young kids does not help. Everyone keeps talking about the grandparents making memories with them but aren\u2019t looking at the bigger picture. Yes it would be nice for them to take the kids and have a good time but what happens if grandpa is having a bad week when they go. Both parents should be there if an emergency was to arise, not leave two elderly grandparents in charge. It would be different if it was like an hour drive but from what I\u2019ve gathered it\u2019s not. \n\nThe safety of the children should be the main concern not being the first one to take them.

Disney has a lot of rides for the smaller age range. There are definitely those for adults and it can be tiring but 5-6 is a great age to take them and the characters will definitely be more magical at that time then when older.", "I\u2019ve been to Disney many time, from 2yo to adulthood, and I think 5-6 is prime because you still believe the mascots are real, like Santa, but are old enough to remember it forever. It\u2019s not someone in a costume, you are meeting the REAL Mickey Mouse and all his friends!!!  \nI remember realizing at some point (around 8yo maybe) that it couldnt be the real Mickey, but that feeling of meeting him when I was 5-6 stayed with me my whole life. It is a core memory and, in my case anyway, kept the magic alive in me, and pushed me to want to create that feeling of pure joy with others.", "It really is the prime time though because its when they will think the characters are real. I went at 6 and I honestly thought I was meeting Belle and Ariel and going to a real castle, by 10 I would have known it was an actor in a costume.", "It absolutely 100% is NOT prime age for Disney.  They are only going to be able to handle half a day at the parks at most before a melt down happens.  Which,  if you're going with old sick people works out fine.  Half the day at the Park and half at the hotel pool.", "I went at 11 and was bored to tears, granted this was decades ago but it was definitely geared to younger kids.", "There are a ton of rides kids that age can go on, and they are still young enough to think the characters are real when they meet them. \n\nBut, they are unlikely to have a whole ton of memories from that time as they get older. I went about that age and my only \"memories \" stem from the pictures in the picture frame my sister kept on her desk. My daughter has been about every other year, and has no real memories of her trips before the age of seven.\n\nIn sum, this trip is for the adults to watch the kids enjoy themselves. Your FIL is dying and wants quality time with his granddaughters. By the time you save up and go back, it will be almost like they're going for the first time, and they'll be big enough to ride a bunch of things for the first time anyway.", "So we just came back. My kids are 11, 9 and 6. My 11 year old was in a weird age. Too old for the magic of characters and too young for some of the other things. He enjoyed it, but he prefers our local Cedar Faire Park. My 6 year old? It was pure magic for her. She believed in the characters, she loved the rides, she loved every moment. 6 was perfect. \n\nDisney is very different than Six Flags/Cedar Faire parks. The rides are more theme oriented than thrill rides and with a few exceptions, the height limit for most rides is 44\".", "I have news for OP.  Taking kids to Disney is not all sunshine and rainbows.  It would never have lived up to his expectations", "Wow I cannot believe people actually think like this", "THE MAN IS DYING! Are you really trying to pull 'poor OP' when his FIL is dying and his last wish is to make a special memory of him for his granddaughters, so when they look back and remember Grandpa it's not just uncomfortable visits to him lying in a hospital bed?", "A valid point, having seen many members of my family go through cancer treatments and losing the battle I fully understand your point and had failed to consider it. I would guess it depends on how the cancer is treating FIL, some just don't have the ER visits while others do.", "so what? it is only for  plane ticket. it only take me 2 hours to drive there, and we only visited less than ten times, Disney is expensive, four parks there. i don't know how many parks  they will visit and where to stay.\n\nDisney has their own hotel inside the park, fancy and costly. you don't just pay for the hotel and park tickets, more others.", "Exactly.  I feel like its not shocking for them to talk to ONE part of a married couple, and assume that they would share that with their spouse", "Yes... also if his FIL did not have cancer, they wouldn't have to rush their kids to Disney.\n\nAt this point it is what it is. OP has the choice of either suck it up and make everyone happy, or be the AH that he is and\n\n1. deprive his kids from their last chance of building happy memories with their grandfather\n2. take away Disney trip from his kids\n3. prevent his dying FIL from spending time with his grand kids at Disney\n4. make his wife question herself if she actually know the man she married", "Usually when you talk to one spouse it is assumed they will fill the other in.  It is not abnormal for parents to mostly deal with their own kid and let them fill in the spouse.", "This is an SO problem, I think- it isn't odd for my parents to say \"hey, how does x sound?\" re: a gift/activity for our kid.

It\u2019s that he wants to show his kids Disney first.", "Purposely means intent- and that falls more on the wife than the parents. They weren\u2019t privy to the conversations surrounding going to Disney or that they had been saving for sometime soon.

My extended family always takes everyone. Disney in Florida offers packages that help to budget.", "Not true, I live in Florida and have 3 kids who have been going to Disney since they were younger than that. They never melted down, we used to rent the double stroller and if they got tired they would swap out sitting in it. When they were around 5-7 was probably THE best age for them, Disney was pure magic then, now they are 10-16 and all of them have felt that Disney is too babyish for several years now.", "As I said, my 11 year old definitely did not get as much out of our trip as his 6 year old sister did. He went when he was 5 and that was prime magic for him", "Probably right.\n\nBut it still sucks.\n\nEveryone trying to act like they don't have feelings and can't be bummed are liars. Everyone, absolutely everyone, can feel more than one absolute emotion. Of course OP is going to be upset losing their childhood dream. At the same time, of course dying grandpa trumps OP's dream. But he's allowed to feel muddy about it all.", "I love everyone's lack of literacy skills.\n\nI said dying grandpa is worse. I ALSO said OP's feelings are valid, because they are.\n\nYou can feel two things at once. Empathy for OP missing out on their childhood dream while understanding Grandpa dying matters more. Life is Gray. Reddit, however, is purely black and white, sadly.", "No, you're twisting words.\n\n\nI simply state of course OP is going to be upset about losing his childhood dream. I also said grandpa trumps OP's dream. I said OP can feel two things at once. YOU chose to have tunnel vision and projected whatever fits your biased reading. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAlso, your hypothetical story, is just that. Dying grandpa can chose something else \"\"to make a special memory of him for his granddaughters, so when they look back and remember Grandpa it's not just uncomfortable visits to him lying in a hospital bed?\"\"\n\nIt doesn't HAVE to be Disney World to make that last memory. Especially during chemo treatments.", ">it is assumed they will fill the other in\n\nYou know the old adage about assuming things don\u2019t you?\n\nNo. Neither parent gets to \u201cfill the other in\u201d on big decisions like this. You talk about together and make a decision together. \n\nMy husband and I had agreed when our kids were older that his dad and step mom could take the kids to Disney since neither of us want to go. There has been a dynamic change in our relationship with the in-laws and my husband absolutely consults with me on making decisions about even going to visit with them, let alone letting them take our kids somewhere. \n\n\nAlso what happens if they go to Disney and wake up the next day to dead grandpa in the hotel room. That would be traumatic and would ruin Disney for the kids probably for a long time.", "I would *absolutely* be worried that the grandparents can\u2019t watch the kids properly. Grandfather has been in treatment for a serious terminal disease that\u2019s wracking his body. He\u2019s weak and compromised, and Disney is enormous. These kids are 5 and 6, and I truly doubt he can keep up, keep everybody together, and keep them safe and happy, 24/7. What about when granddad is exhausted and the kids are wound-up, whiny and unsettled? What if one wanders off? I think these grandparents are in way over their heads. It\u2019s not sensible.\n\nAlso wife is a real ah for not discussing this first. Two yesses are required, one from each parent, for a decision like this. And now that it\u2019s been announced, OP is painted into a corner as the meanie.", "And yet op does have the right to veto the trip.  Wife is a true asshole setting this up for op to be the villain.  It sounds like she knew he would say no and is backing him into a corner.  I don\u2019t know if I would have said yes to a trip like this without me when my kids were little, regardless of in-law or parent impending mortality.  Actually, i know I would have said no.  I didn\u2019t let either set of parents take my littles on vacation trips without me.  I didn\u2019t trust either set to supervise my littles as I liked.", "Honestly, yes. The solution should have been for all 6 of them to go. I just went to Disney with my mom, another friend went with her parents. Plus, in my experience, I think the grandparents are going to struggle with the parks and the kids. I did 22,000 steps a day at Disney.", "I've never been to disney and I would feel that a trip to disney is a big deal with my kids. Different people have different things that are important to them and it doesn't make them an AH. OP does need to see the bigger picture here and let his kids go or figure out a way to do it together", "My parents and my husbands parents always speak to their respective children and then we speak to spouse and report back. That way no one is ever on the spot with their in laws and can have a longer private discussion. I would hate to be out on the spot and look like the bad guy with my in-laws. My husband comes and speaks to me. We discuss (at length if needed), make a decision and then present a United front. \n\nIt\u2019s not the grandparents fault for assuming that she would discuss with the husband or have decision making authority.", "Her father is DYING, and you think she's the asshole? It's not surprising you agree with the OP, because you're both huge assholes.", "Yes,,, because she didn\u2019t include her husband in the decision.  It wasn\u2019t her decision to solely make\u2014-regardless of her fathers medical condition.  Having a terminal illness isn\u2019t a pass that means everyone has to do what what you want or can\u2019t say no to you.", "OP is being a parent to his kids.  That is his number 1 responsibility.  If you think that makes him an AH, you need to re-examine some things.", "No one thinks he's an asshole for being a parent to his kid, they think he's an asshole for wanting to deny his kids a lovely experience because he's jealous."]}
