You should give the phone numbers of the friends who said you're victim blaming to your sis and tell them to expect to be called for babysitting help.\n\nJust cuz you WFH doesn't mean you can look after kids like you said. WFH is STILL work. What if you have to head to the office for a meeting or are in a zoom meeting. You can't be looking after kids and DOING work. Just cuz you're not in an office doesn't mean you can babysit.\n\nSo your parents can say no, but not you? And what kind of parents threaten you financially like that. Tell 'em if they go through with that then you'll go NC with them. You don't need those kind of people in your life.", "NTA I don\u2019t know if you live with your parents or not, but if you do, move out as soon as you can, and cut contact with those blackmailing assholes. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting they held any inheritance you may get over your head in order to coerce into watching your sisters kids. You at least now know who they favour, and it ain\u2019t you.", "NTA.  I like your logic and reasoning.", "NTA\n\neven Jesus could not win everyone's heart, why do you bother some noise?\n\nYour parents are kind of AH though.\n\nIf they are rich, then pay for babysitter for your sister.\n\nAction always louder than words", "NTA.\n\ntheir not your kids therefore not your responsibility! and your time off from work is your time to do what you want not look after someone else\u2019s kids. and especially if you aren\u2019t close with your sister. bethany should be looking after her own kids. i disagree with your friends who said you are victim blaming bethany, bethany knew what she was getting in to and continued to do so after (what i presume is multiple) people warning her about it.\n\nif she was asking you to spend 1 day a month with the kids then fair enough but asking you to look after them is absurd", "NTA\n\nYou can NOT take care of four children and work from home. Most employers require that you have chid care if there are young children in the house. You would be jeopardizing your job and your financial future.\n\nIf your parents want to disown you, so be it. Tell them to use their \"inheritance\" to pay for child care if they feel someone needs to step up. \n\nAnd tell your \"friends\" that anyone who works full time really has no time to babysit four kids in their spare time. I work full time and so I have limited time available to take care of my life in terms of errands, house chores, shopping, personal care plus a single person generally needs to meet with friends and have some chill time to read or just relax.", "NTA she does need to deal with the consequences.", "NTA you have a life to live and at 25 you need to focus on yourself. Whatever bad choices your sister took and what your parents supported are onto them to deal with. With a full time work, your free time is for you to relax to avoid a burn out and the situation is a lot different from a tragedy in the family. Your parents threatening to leave all their wealth to your sister is even more disgusting as its both financial and emotional blackmail. Your response was apt and there's no point in drowning in endless misery provided by the so called family and not having a life of your own. Stay bold and build a career and a life you deserve. All the best.", "Nta\n\nYou aren't victim blaming your sister. She knew he was a bad boy (it's what she liked about him), and odds are he's the type of bad boy that's on the bad side of the law, and she was with him for years before they had a kids. She isn't a victim at that point, she's an accomplice. \n\nParent's are threatening to not give you anything when they pass if you don't watch the kids, does that mean they are willing to pay you now to watch them, most likely not. They will most likely still leave the majority to her, even if you did help now, because \"she needs it.\" So it's a super hollow threat.", "NTA, your perspective is reasonable.\n\nYour friends are wrong about you victim blaming - your sister is not a victim to Adam, at least not by anything you have said. Yes she is a \u201cvictim\u201d to her circumstances but she chose to stay with him, knowing he is a \u201cbad boy\u201d with criminal tendencies that could land him in further trouble with the law and thus render her a single mother whilst he is in prison. You are not responsible for her actions and the way you responded to your parents threats about inheritance was very level headed - after all it is their choice to do what they like with their assets when they pass.", "Nta everyone else sucks tho", " What is your parents problem? Trying to parentify  you at 26? No. Tell them if they feel that way then they need to keep that same energy when they need someone to care for them", "NTA. she wanted the excitement of a bad boy and she got it, that\u2019s no one\u2019s responsibility but hers. your sister isn\u2019t a child and they need to stop treating her and such, she is grown and needs to fulfil her duties as a mother. also your parents are irresponsible for enabling her behaviour and selfish for trying to offload this on you. stand your ground and good luck op!", "nta\n\nvictim blaming? what exactly is Bethany the victim of? the victim of her own bad desicions? get out of here.\n\nyour parents are also the ah for holding money/inheritance over your head.\n\nyour family sounds awful, quite frankly. if they re so concerned they can pay for a baby sitter or something.", "NTA. Your sister's life choices are on her. Don't be guilted by friends or family. To do something you're not willing to do. Live your life.", "NTA. Play stupid games win stupid prizes, she has made bad life choices and now has to live with the consequences of choosing a partner being fully aware of what they were and then choosing to have 4 children with them. Love the way everyone thinks because you wfh you\u2019re free to do things, you do actually have to work!", "Clear NTA. Outrageous demand and threat from your parents. I you go NC with them, they deserve it .i", "NTA. Your parents and sister are being very selfish asking you to watch your nieces and nephews bc you work from home. Even though they are family, they are not your responsibility. I like the idea of you offering to help when you\u2019re not working, but again, you would not be TA if you decide to not offer that.\n\nYour sister is a grown up and she needs to figure out how to manage without relying so heavily on you and your parents.", "NTA. What exactly is Bethany \u201cthe victim\u201d of? Her terrible choices?", "\"Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part\"\n\nThere are hundreds of memes, posters, plaques, etc. with that phrase.  Some people still don't get it.\n\nNTA\n\nIf you actually *plan for failure*, as your sister did, then doubly so", "Nta", "nta ... and your parents are now blackmailing you .... they can cut you out of their will but you can also but you can also but them out of your life let them know the ball is in their court they can decide the outcome ... also adams family can step up and help out aswell nothing is stopping them", "NTA... Every one else seems to be on some level.\n\nAnd what good are you going to be once you get fired because HER kids distract you form YOUR job? Will your parents then step in and pay you to take care of your sister's kids (Probably not). Your job has to come first as your means of self support.\n\nYour parents should watch them while your sister is working, and when she gets off, she takes over. You can offer yo help in your off time, but you have a job that you need that pays your bills. End of story.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWow your parents suck. Once again the kid who does well gets punished for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for looking after them during your time off... sure. Occasionally. As a babysitter on the occasional Saturday night. Not as a regular thing.", "It's a complex one! It's difficult when working from home to be expected to care for young kids. How long will you be expected to care for them and who has been caring for them until now?\n\nWhat is your sister doing that means she can't care for them full time? Is she working too?\n\nWorking from home gives you the flexibility to help when needed but I agree you can't look after the 24/7 while working!\n\nCould you get a job that require you to be in an office or away from home?", "Maybe the sister can use that inheritance to get childcare."]}
