Your parents threatening to leave all their wealth to your sister is even more disgusting as its both financial and emotional blackmail.

Right?? Butyou said, she made a CHOICE to be with a felon that was nearly twice her age. That's not victim blaming that's calling a spade a spade. Yes your delivery was harsh, but it is very important that it was said. Trust me.", "NTA. How is she a victim? Was he abusive or just a bad boy? I get it sucks for her cause she\u2019s now a single parent but her choices did put her in that situation. As for watching nieces & nephews, not your responsibility. WFH doesn\u2019t mean not working. Some people just don\u2019t get that you still need to work even tho it\u2019s in the convenience of your house. I used to have that same problem.

I'll take a different route here and say your sisters partner choice aside, she hasn't had that much of a relationship with you. You said that she's basically a stranger. We all make mistakes in our life and bad things happen that we don't see coming, even if others do, but to try to put that on someone simply because they're blood related to you is wrong. If she cared about you she would've made more of an effort to have a relationship with you and then maybe there's room to talk about you helping her when shit happens but she can't just not have a relationship with you and then expect you to act like extremely close siblings.", "NTA.

He comes back around 3 years later (still a drinker) and she thought, \"Let's have baby #2.\" Repeat scenario #1. He comes back 2 years later (a drinker). Has paid some child support, but works a lot under the table, so his income looks pretty low. SIL's plan. Let's have baby #3. My husband and I saved her home from foreclosure 3x and said don't ask again. To your friends: Bethany may not have thought she would be a single mom, but she knew her husband broke the law along the way. She should have seen this coming.", "NTA - we almost got a \"no assholes here\" but it's horrible for them to hold the inheritance over your head to make you watch the darn kids.

That's messed up and cruel to the children. I guess being a single at home mum isn't that exciting for her.", "NTA. I'm really sick of parents trying to say that their kids need to \"give back\" or that they owe the parents for taking care of them their whole lives. Literally none of us are here by choice. We all exist because someone else's horniness and/or vanity led them to create us, and virtually every society on Earth demands that you provide your kids with as much as possible so they don't grow up to be a detriment to society. By not aborting or giving the kids up for adoption, parents implicitly accept that responsibility, so you as the child are under zero obligation to them.", "NTA. Your parents can threaten you with not leaving anything behind that\u2019s fine. When they\u2019re on their deathbed they can remember they lost their son.", ">and what I said about Adam came off as victim-blaming Bethany for her situation.\n\nWTF?, what kind of crazy pills are your friends taking?, victimg-blaming is blaming someone for something that happened to them that was **completely outside of their control** and this isn't the case, your sister knew who Adam was and still married him and had kids with him so she was in complete control and was aware of the kind of asshole she was marrying, she's a victim of her own decisions, hence you can blame her for the outcome of her poor choices.\n\nNTA, I'm sorry that now you know how low will your parents go to force their will on you with their disgusting threats, hope you can get a place where you don't have to tolerate them or your sister.", "NTA.  So sorry OP.  Your parents are horrible to ask you to subsume your life to your completely irresponsible OLDER sister.", "NTA. Bethany is a victim of her own choices. Helping family out occasionally is ok. However, no one should be expected to be a second parent to other people children.", "I\u2019m curious about this as well.   What exactly was Adam sent to prison for?\n\nIf he beat her kids and she immediately left and called the police, for instance, then I have more sympathy than if he held up a convenience store.", " A lot of offices make you verify that you will not be minding children while you are at home. (They might not in this case, but that is a good story to tell the sister & flying monkeys!)", "Her parents who probably enabled her  and want to sacrifice their other daughter to continue to do so. They're not doing her any favors either. OP should just get away from all these people. She seems the only healthy one here.", "FACTS. I didn't believe \"inheritance coercion\" (patent pending lol) existed until recently when my MIL's rich husband said we'd be cut out of the will of my kids weren't raised the same religion as them. OP's parents are basically trying to promise a long term jackpot for child care, which I would bet sister's inheritance would have seen the majority going to sister in the first place.\n\nETA: I never expected us to be in any will so the fact that it was threatened was a weirdly pleasant surprise", "Exactly. She was unnecessarily rude.", "how was she victim blaming her sister", "wait. so how OP the AH then", "Why tf would she change her whole damn job to accommodate her sister\u2019s bs choices? Her sister\u2019s kids are her sister\u2019s responsibility. Period.", "Actions have consequences. Simple truth. Has nothing to do with being on a high horse.", "Also the parents are 60, they might live another 25-30 years. That \u201cinheritance\u201d might be used up by then. If the inheritance is a big enough sum to care for both of their health for a collective of 50-60 years then they can pay for their failure-to-launch-daughter themselves.", "> How can one become so bounded\nBy choices that somebody else makes?\nAdele song\n\nAnd yes, poor kids.", "Not to mention she simply cannot do it.", "Where does it say that your life needs to be dragged down by irresponsible people? That's not her fault. Apparently, the parents have money, so they could afford their healthcare in the older years. The sister chose to bring 4 humans into the world. Her responsibility.", "That's a massive leap of logic.\nIn this situation I would absolutely say no, but if my parents needed me for something to do with one of them I would still be there for them even after this debacle", "She didn't ask: \u201cAITA for not wanting to watch my sister's kids while I WFH full time\" \n\nShe asked:  \u201cAITA for making unnecessary and judgmental comments repeatedly to a family member whose spouse is in prison?\"\n\nShe can have opinions all she wants. She doesn't agree with her sister's choices. I wouldn't have either. But we all make shitty decisions sometimes. It's called life. And throwing those decisions in their face in a mean, cruel way is absolutely inappropriate. \n\nOP is 100% on a high horse acting like the fact that she hasn't made any choices that turn out to be wrong somehow gives her a moral high ground and allows her to degrade her sister.", "My MIL is 86 ... very spry, has her faculties, is controlling.", "And just being 60 isn't really proof they can't watch their own grandkids. There don't seem to be any particular health concerns preventing it, they just don't wanna.", "I agree 100 percent! \n\nI am off the camp you kids your responsibility! \n\nIf mom and dad want to give sis the money then sis is responsible for their care op gets to live her best life.\n\nI also believe who ever said it takes a village needs to step on some hot wheels cars. Because it doesn\u2019t take a village it only require you!", "I\u2019m in my sixties and my mom is 95.  Inheritance threats lost power long ago.", "I don\u2019t even understand why she appears to be the only option they even have down. It\u2019s not even like they\u2019re asking her to watching them one afternoon a week, it appears to be *all the time*?! Wtf?! How are these grandparents just peaceing out of *all* of it? Where is dad\u2019s family? Why is the first option saddling this childless person with three toddlers and a seven year old rather than the mom getting her own WFH job?", "HA I'm 41 and my parents died 8 and 15 years ago, respectively. There is no inheritance, only debt.", "Exactly! My folks are 59&62. I HOPE I don\u2019t get [much of] an inheritance because that means that they lived long and had the money to enjoy/be taken care of. I don\u2019t want them to die broke/stressed about money but I would cover their costs of course if they did.", "Most people who try and whine \"it takes a village\" aren't even using the phrase correctly anyway. \"The village\" was a reciprocal thing, e.g. I look after your kids with mine, you do my laundry with yours, or something along those lines. The village also had to be cultivated. Most people who use the phrase now just want to shove their kids onto someone else for no payment while they do whatever.", "It's just such an unreasonable ask. What exactly were they expecting her to do? Quit her job? The fact they doubled down when she said it wasn't even possible is bs too. They expect her to blow up her life, because her sister made the choice to blow up her own. Why do the people pushing out babies they can't afford always get the sympathy? Why does no one tell them to step up and make better decisions? These are humans ffs!!\n\nThe village works when everyone is on the same page and no one is forced to be part of it. But even then, you can't put all of the responsibility on others and you need to know you can do it without them. A lot of people don't have that and that's ok too.", "With healthcare etc their may not be much of an inheritance to get by the time both parents are gone anyway.", " Very sorry to hear this. You should not be responsible for their debts", "I say the same thing to my parents all the time. Use your money, enjoy yourselves as much as you can, and please please don\u2019t worry about trying to save anything to leave for me. My parents are blue collar. They worked SO HARD for every single penny they have. My dad worked in a factory from the age of 17 until he was eligible to retire. Then he went to work as an electrician for another 6-7 years. My dad retired last year, and my mom will retire next year. They deserve to enjoy their retirement, and their life as much as they possibly can. \n\nI personally will probably never be able to afford to retire. Changes are many of us in my generation will have to work until the day we die. I still constantly tell them not to worry about me. I will be okay, so please don\u2019t give yourselves hardships trying to make sure I\u2019m left money after your gone. I hope they live to be 110 years old, and need to use every dime they have doing it."]}
