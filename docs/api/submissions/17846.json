Your parents threatening to leave all their wealth to your sister is even more disgusting as its both financial and emotional blackmail.

Right?? Butyou said, she made a CHOICE to be with a felon that was nearly twice her age. That's not victim blaming that's calling a spade a spade. Yes your delivery was harsh, but it is very important that it was said. Trust me.", "NTA. How is she a victim? Was he abusive or just a bad boy? I get it sucks for her cause she\u2019s now a single parent but her choices did put her in that situation. As for watching nieces & nephews, not your responsibility. WFH doesn\u2019t mean not working. Some people just don\u2019t get that you still need to work even tho it\u2019s in the convenience of your house. I used to have that same problem. Your parents are being pretty crappy holding an inheritance over your head of this but it\u2019s their money so in the end they can do what they want with it.

I'll take a different route here and say your sisters partner choice aside, she hasn't had that much of a relationship with you. You said that she's basically a stranger. We all make mistakes in our life and bad things happen that we don't see coming, even if others do, but to try to put that on someone simply because they're blood related to you is wrong. If she cared about you she would've made more of an effort to have a relationship with you and then maybe there's room to talk about you helping her when shit happens but she can't just not have a relationship with you and then expect you to act like extremely close siblings.", "NTA.

I was a SAHM for years and I would still be very unwilling to do what they are asking you to do, even if they paid me. They are so far out of line.

NTA, it isn't feasible since you are working.  Hey, occasionally babysitting or sending kid toys.  And your parents are really wrong.  I know it is their grandkids, but you never sacrifice one kid for another.", "NTA, time off is time off, not time to spend doing other work.\nAlso, there's no victim blaming here.

Make it clear you neither need nor want it - take away their power.", "YTA for what you said, absolutely. \n\nYou are under absolutely no obligation to babysit, and saying that you can't because of your work is completely legitimate. \n\nBut you are definitely an AH for throwing her relationship in her face. \"AITAH for telling my sister that I am not responsible for her life choices and that because she chose to have children with an unstable person, she chose to deal with the consequences.\" Get off your high horse. Heaven forbid you lead with your heart someday and it doesn't go the way you planned.", "You're NTA for refusing to help but rubbing her nose in her mistakes is an asshole thing to do.

Bethany did choose this life. I have a SIL who had one child with my alcoholic BIL. He did not step up. Left her with the baby. Wouldn't pay child support. He comes back around 3 years later (still a drinker) and she thought, \"Let's have baby #2.\" Repeat scenario #1. He comes back 2 years later (a drinker). Has paid some child support, but works a lot under the table, so his income looks pretty low. SIL's plan. Let's have baby #3. My husband and I saved her home from foreclosure 3x and said don't ask again. To your friends: Bethany may not have thought she would be a single mom, but she knew her husband broke the law along the way. She should have seen this coming.", "NTA - we almost got a \"no assholes here\" but it's horrible for them to hold the inheritance over your head to make you watch the darn kids.
