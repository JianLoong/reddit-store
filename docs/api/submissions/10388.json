When my sister came home and asked him what he did today, he told her about the food that i made him for lunch and my sister flipped saying that I wasn't respecting her by giving him food that he isn't allowed to have. I tried to explain to her that i didn't have much else in the house and that i also gave him fruit to balance, and she said i should've only given him the fruit and instead of juice, only water. I told her that she was being too strict and that she needed to either loosen up or go grocery shopping.\n\nI want to add that he IS ALLOWED to eat chicken, but she is mad because they were FROZEN chicken nuggets and fries that I cooked in the air fryer.
