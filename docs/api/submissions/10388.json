The thing with my sister is that she is a health nut. She goes to the gym 5/7 days of the week, eats only healthy and vegan food, and even makes my nephew (6m)  follow the same rules minus the gym obviously. She just got a new job and I offered to babysit her son while she works because I work from home and rarely leave the house. We haven't gone grocery shopping to accommodate her needs yet due to her just starting work, and she refused to let me go to the store for her and pay for her groceries, so everything in the house is food that i bought. My nephew told me around noon that he was hungry so I made him some chicken nuggets, fries, and fruit with a juice box. He ate all of it and asked for more fries, so i made him more. When my sister came home and asked him what he did today, he told her about the food that i made him for lunch and my sister flipped saying that I wasn't respecting her by giving him food that he isn't allowed to have. I tried to explain to her that i didn't have much else in the house and that i also gave him fruit to balance, and she said i should've only given him the fruit and instead of juice, only water. I told her that she was being too strict and that she needed to either loosen up or go grocery shopping.\n\nI want to add that he IS ALLOWED to eat chicken, but she is mad because they were FROZEN chicken nuggets and fries that I cooked in the air fryer.

Yeah, sister is definitely TA and belongs on choosing beggars. He's allowed to have nuggets and fries, but she freaks out because they were frozen and then made in an air fryer? This is beyond objectionable, it's straight up child negligence (and honestly getting close to bordering on abuse) to say \"I won't let you buy food I agree with, and would rather my child starve than eat food sullied by the freezer or an air fryer\".

I have food sensitivities around preservatives (they trigger migraines) so I don't buy much pre-made frozen food, but I buy fresh meat and freeze that!

I see your point, but I still don't see how both sisters didn't discuss what to give the child for lunch (hence ESH).\n\nI tried placing myself in OP's situation. I would have called my sister at work for instructions because feeding meat to a child raised as vegan is crossing a line. Worst case scenario if I couldn't get through to the sister, I'd have at least ordered vegan food.\n\nFrom the post, it doesn't seem that OP made any effort at all to speak to her sister beforehand. \n\nAs for the sister, she's definitely being an AH for blowing up.

It's cheap junky nuggets, cheaper junkier junk food, or letting them starve on 1/3 portions of good quality food. This is why the obesity epidemic primarily effects poor families in the US.", "Look at the edit, it makes it worse.
