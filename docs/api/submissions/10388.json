When my sister came home and asked him what he did today, he told her about the food that i made him for lunch and my sister flipped saying that I wasn't respecting her by giving him food that he isn't allowed to have. I tried to explain to her that i didn't have much else in the house and that i also gave him fruit to balance, and she said i should've only given him the fruit and instead of juice, only water. I told her that she was being too strict and that she needed to either loosen up or go grocery shopping.\n\nI want to add that he IS ALLOWED to eat chicken, but she is mad because they were FROZEN chicken nuggets and fries that I cooked in the air fryer.

NTA\n\nThe general rule in my family is, if you're watching someone's kid, and the parent hasn't provided an adequate amount of food that's ready-to-eat or very close to it, then you get to feed the kid whatever's convenient for you.\n\nMaybe lay this rule down on her, and if she doesn't like it she can make other childcare arrangements.", "NTA - but this arrangement is not going to work out.   \n\n\nSis needs a different house and a different sitter for her child - one she can control completely and for whom she is responsible for providing all supplies. \n\nBut you would have to keep a careful eye on your nephew and how he grows since clearly she is OK pushing her food agenda over the health and well being of her child and would happily let him go hungry as long as she could maintain her food prejudices - which is a short step from child neglect.", "Choosing beggar springs to mind. NTA.", "NTA. She expected you to just feed him fruit and water while she worked? That's a very long time for a kid to go without a real meal.", "NTA. She's the one forcing her lifestyle on her kid, not you. While nuggets and fries aren't the healthiest foods ever, as a one-off it'll make no difference to anything. Also air fryers are great.", "She managed to put you on the defensive. Next time be ready. Tell her she provided no food for her son and if she doesn\u2019t have approved food for him, you will give him a meal. She doesn\u2019t get to tell you to give him a nutritionally inadequate meal of fruit because she didn\u2019t plan ahead. You offered to shop for her and she turned you down so she needs to get her act together.  Her son is a growing boy; not a mini version of mom.", "They need you ! Just apologize then do your best , your  a good auntie and sister . Parents become incensed over what they can control . The world is terrifying when you have  kid .she can\u2019t protect him but she can protect him from freezer burn \ud83e\udee3for now !!

Did your sister not consider that her son would need to eat that day? She should have sent food with him if she\u2019s so worried. I feel bad for the kid, he was probably excited to eat something fun for once.", "Introduce your sister to the term \u201corthorexia\u201d", "NTA. Her child was fed. Fruit and water is not adequate nutrition. And the air fryer is simply a convection oven. Forced heated air cooks the food. It isn't any more unhealthy than a traditional oven. If she wanted him to eat something other than what you had on hand, she should have gone to the grocery store when you offered. Also, an occasional treat can be part of a healthy balanced diet.", "NTA. Your sister in her wisdom clearly does not respect her son's appetite as it is obvious her kid does not want to be a vegan and clearly prefers the more normal meal you gave him, that is apparently forbidden by his overbearing mother.", "NTA, She is basically projecting her eating disorder onto your nephew and that is not okay. It\u2019s not okay to project your insecurities and problems onto others. Second, she is also committed child abuse feed her son just fruit and water a day, kids need to eat more than that and he really shouldn\u2019t force her son to be vegan either and it\u2019s okay to have junk food every once in a while.

You gave him a balanced, kid friendly meal.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you set him up watching horror movies with a 2 liter of Mountain Dew and enormous bag of Ruffle chips.

She should have gone to the store and gotten *approved* food if she was that concerned about it. It\u2019s one meal, for crying out loud.", "NTA: That kid is malnourished if he\u2019s only allowed to eat fruits and water. Even if that\u2019s not his situation, one order of fries and nuggets will not negatively impact his health at all. More to the point, did your sister ever actually tell you she didn\u2019t want him eating fast food?", "NTA\n\nThose are some specific diet guidelines. What did she expect you to do if she hadn't been to the store? Did she leave instructions for lunch? Sounds like there's a learning curve here.", "NTA If your sister really cared enough about what her ate, she would have had food within her guidelines available for him to eat for snacks and meals before leaving him with you for the day.  Fruit and water doesn't make a balanced diet for any meal -- much less for a 6 month old's all day diet.  Your sister's the AH on this one.  Being orthorexic is as much of an eating disorder as overeating or any other restrictive eating syndrome.  She is harming her son by requiring him to follow her adult eating rules.", "You're NTA. She didn't provide the food she wanted him to eat. She wouldn't let you purchase her narrow list of accepted foods. Just what did she expect to happen?

I don\u2019t let my kids eat frozen foods\u2014I spent an hour today making them homemade chicken nuggets. But I\u2019d never leave them with no food in the house and then get upset with you for feeding what you had (as long as no allergies). I literally take food to my in laws because they never take my kids allergies into account, and I always have safe food at restaurants (my allergy kid is only 1). Your sis is irresponsible", "I was reading this as she gave him fruit along with the fruit juice and sis was all like he should have only had one or the other, not both, probably because of the sugars. The rest was wrong because it was frozen and air fried. ??", "Eh OP is NTA for making do with what they had, but fruit juice is a big no no from the pediatrician and dentist.", "lol then she can pay someone to watch him and buy him food", "Obviously the OP is not TA for feeding her nephew a meal that is absolutely fine as part of a balanced diet, but eating fruit for lunch as a one off wouldn't be neglect and is a lot more than 25 calories. One medium apple is about a hundred calories; one banana is about the same. Two apples, a banana and ten strawberries would probably be an adequate lunch, calories-wise, for a 6 year old.", "NTA...you fed the kid, not like they had an allergy to it.", "wtf are you even talking about? its just fucking chicken nuggets. its bread crumbs, seasoning, egg, and chicken. these are all completely safe ingredients to ingest. dont force your ignorance on a child. if you\u2019re that insane that you think chicken nuggets are toxic then you should absolutely not have a child. i would immediately call cps if i heard that crunchy mom bs. do you also think that essential oils will treat diseases?", "We have all our adult children airfryers for Christmas.
