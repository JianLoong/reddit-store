Our son is in daycare full-time and we are very happy with his care. It's ten minutes from our house and my work. Husband WFH most days. We both work 8am-4/5pm M-F. I also have a very strained relationship with my family. Parents have seen my baby a handful of times, sister has never met him. Parents have questioned my parenting since I've had him. The hard rules I had were no kissing the baby (which mother has done in front of my face multiple times after I asked her not to) and that we didn't let people meet him for a while due to high RSV cases when he was born.  \n\n\nMy mother (67f) called me yesterday saying she had a great idea to spend time with my son. She'll drive to my house (45 minutes from hers with no traffic), pick up my son, drive back to her house and spend the day with him there. She said she wants to feed him, put him down for a nap, and walk him around the neighborhood. Then she'll drive back to our house and drop him off when she's done. This is all to help us and \"give me a break.\"  I will be at work while she has him, he's breastfed and will need bottles still.  She has not offered any other help when I was postpartum. I've also never mentioned that I needed a break from my son. I told her I want to spend as much time with him as possible.\n\nWhen she brought up her great idea, I told her it didn't make me feel comfortable. I don't want him spending close to 4 hours in a car and being that far away from me if something happens. She said she's perfectly capable of taking care of a baby. \n\nShe says she never gets to see him. I've offered for her to come over after I get done work during the week and weekends. Weekends don't work for her because she likes to spend them at the beach and she doesn't want to spend time in my city because it's \"dangerous.\" \n\nThis spiralled into a big argument because she kept pushing me to take him and wasn't respecting my answer. \n\nSo, AITA for not letting my mother take my baby for one a day a week to spend time with him?\n\nEdit: sorry about the driving time math. It was early morning when I wrote this. The baby would be in the car for 45 minutes (minimum time without any traffic which never happens) two times. Mother would be driving close to 4 hours.\n\nEdit 2: My \"dangerous\" city is her words, not mine. I live in a major tourist destination with world class restaurants and attractions. She lives in rural, farm land area and views city life as not ideal and inherently dangerous by watching the news.", "created_utc": 1683712578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dlurf/aita_for_not_letting_my_mother_take_my_baby_one/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But not dangerous enough to drive to, through, pick up/drop off grandchild, then back out? She's full of it and just wants her way and for you to capitulate to her demands.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd whilst, yes, it's \"only\" a child, they're not exactly difficult to look after, she's 67. Her reactions aren't what they were in her 20's/30's/40's. That's a long drive and the longer the drive the greater the window for accidents  and issues. I would not entertain it in the slightest. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI found out once my parents who were meant to be sitting my son at their home had in fact snuck out to a play farm about 30 minutes away. Not that they'd just decied to pop there and then told me after - no, they went and specifically kept it from me because they'd been told quite explicitly NOT to take him places, and they'd hidden it. It was only when my father had phone issues he asked me to fix that I came across pictures. They knew they'd fucked up and they were never allowed him for extended periods after that. I simply didn't trust them to not go behind my back and sneak off to do things again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf your mother is trying to position this as \"helping\" you when you neither need the break or haven't asked for help means she's just pulling on assumed loose threads in the hopes of snagging one where she's \"helping\" so as to future proof any comeback. \"What do you mean I shouldn't have done X with him, *I was only trying to help like you asked*\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou've said no. If she doesn't respect the answer she doesn't respect you and/or your parenting.

If you want no sugar guess what your mom's gonna do. If you want him to not watch tv, guess what he's gonna get. It'll make him \"love\" her more because he'll want candy and television...or whatever he's not getting at home but only at gma's.\n\nAlso, no one is \"perfectly capable of taking care of a baby.\" We all do our best, but no one is perfectly capable. No one is. At 67, doubly so. \n\nStick with your gut. You're already paying for daycare, and if something happens to baby, hubby is right there to pick him up.

No need to discuss it further, but to stress out:\n\n1/ Baby is still breastfed, so traveling for a day without you anywhere is unnecessary risk.  \n2/ You work 10 minutes away from his daycare and home; If anything happens at the daycare you can leave work or your husband can take a pause and be to him within quarter hour. That's huge difference than him being more than hour away (with traffic)  \n3/ 6 month old baby is unlikely to have been away from parents for that long (day-care sort of doesn't count, you are still close) or that far away.\n\nYou are his momma. You decide when YOU will be ready to be away from him for this long and with whom and for what purpose. This is not your mom's decision. It doesn't matter if she is \"able to take care of a baby\".

She thinks I'm overprotective and am isolating him. I was keeping him isolated when he was a newborn with no immune system. I also work at a major university hospital where the attached children's hospital had to turn away sick babies over the winter because they were so full.
