Child was saying it hurts and getting the matting out would have hurt more, now it's one thing with your own kid to sit her down and tell her it can't be helped but it's much harder when you are looking after a kid that isn't yours to both see them in pain and be the cause of that pain.\n5.

That was not emergency that her head needed shaving right away without first checking with the parent.", "Yeah I figured that might be the case. In that case, NTA - it's more important not to hurt the child, and there's no inherent trauma over having short hair as long as nobody in the family creates it for her. \n\nIt might be worth being clear to your sister that she needs to ask for help before neglecting her kid, though - it must be rough what she's going through, but social services will get called if she can't look after her daughter's hygiene and welfare...", "Your comment(s) violate [rule 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index#wiki_3._accept_your_judgement).

If the mother is in such a bad place then there was nothing she was going to do about it with her daughter anyway and some adult needed to step in and make a decision. Now, was the child in actual severe pain for three days like OP said, I don\u2019t know. That kinda sounds like she\u2019s trying to justify the decision.", "I guess we don\u2019t know how much of an effort was made. OP did say she tried though, and the mother only responded after pictures were sent.", "Yes, there is a lot more going on. But the immediate problem needed to be fixed. Sure, there probably needs to be family counseling in the future. But you are going to make a 4 year old wait weeks to tell someone else that her head hurts?", "Because if OP is white and niece is Hispanic, black, etc and has a hair texture that OP is unfamiliar with then it\u2019s an obvious YTA. You don\u2019t shave a four year olds head because you can\u2019t be bother to learn to care for it.", "If OP has straight hair and the BIL is black, the niece's hair is likely very different than OP's. There's an idea out there that white caretakers often struggle to care for their black or mixed child's hair, and they end up shaving or doing something else to make it easier for them rather than learn to care for it. But if OP took the niece to a salon, that probably isn't the issue.", "So she waits for the child's parents. Who are dealing with a medical emergency. And I didn't mention different hair types, just melanin.", "We tried, the deep conditioner and oil. We bought dematting stuff, we soaked it, we tried four different products it wasn\u2019t coming out and it was hurting her.", "It sounds like the salon knew exactly how to deal with matted hair. Hence the $50 quote.", "YEP. I have seen videos about this and there is an extreme difference and a reason why hairdressers charge so much. Some dematting takes over 10 hours.", "Matted beyond repair in a week though? I think the sentence in the OP missed a word, but I read it that husband had been in hospital a week.", "We had to get close to her skull with the bun, so big old patch missing so it got evened out, she has longer strands in the front framing her face but the rest is basically really short.", "I would ask the kid. I merely think from the tone of the post that OP doesn\u2019t seem the type. That\u2019s what I meant.", "That update makes a huge difference. I assumed it was a few hours!\n\nYeah, OP was defacto parent of the child. Assuming the child was genuinely in a high level of discomfort, I'll go with NTA.", "And she tried for 3 days. I don\u2019t think OP could jave done more to contact her", "She waited 2 days and got no response, how long should she wait with a kid in pain? I know but usually different hair types match race and ethnicity.", "IT STILL IS NOT YOUR PLACE TO SHAVE A CHILDS HEAD! Do you not understand that? It\u2019s not your child! It\u2019s not your head!", "I was also thinking the price was bc they didn't really want to do it.  Like, they knew *how* to but didn't want to deal with a wiggly 4 yo so they priced it super high.\n\nMaybe it's a normal price?", "You didn't answer the other questions so, \n\nWas your sister in at the hospital? Would explain why she wasn't picking up.\n\nWhy did you feel like your niece's hair had to be dealt with that day? That level of matting takes more than a week usually. From your post it's only been one week since the accident and you've only been watching your niece for a few hours. Why was it so urgent?", "I agree. The main take away was that mom was in a real bad place, and I hope she is getting help.", "So I should have left her in pain, that doesn\u2019t make any sense", "It's a normal price for the hair salons hourly services, has nothing to do with the mat. It covers paying for the time that the stylist takes away from doing other services. They're not working for free. \n\nMy haircuts are $80 and are an hour and a half to wash, cut, and style.", "It definitely is for they take their time to detangle it with the least amount of damage plus all the products they use.", "She has been going back and forth, it was hurting her that\u2019s why I felt in needed to be deal with as soon as possible. I wasn\u2019t going to leave her in pain since mom wouldn\u2019t pick up. Not to mention I have been trying to reach her since I got a look at her hair. I sent so many texts and calls, I even tried mom to contact her. \n\nMake the timeline clearer, I got her Tuesday morning, went to the salon Wednesday and got the hair cut today. So it\u2019s been three day since I have had her", "You could have easily waited another couple of hours or a day waiting for her mom to respond.", "You should have left her with hair! She wasn\u2019t in constant pain. She didn\u2019t have a needle in her toe. \n\nSHES NOT YOUR CHILD! You don\u2019t want to know if your TA or not, you want someone to justify WTF you did.", "If you\u2019re not going to accept the judgement, don\u2019t post. YTA. You should not have done that. You were supposed to make your sister\u2019s life easier, instead you\u2019ve shown that she can\u2019t trust you with her child.\n\nJust a note, she probably didn\u2019t respond because she didn\u2019t want it done and assumed you were reasonable and wouldn\u2019t shave her head without parental permissions\n\nYou had every right to push your sister do so something about your niece\u2019s hair, especially if it was bothering your niece.\n\nYou had NO RIGHT to shave a four year olds head.", "I'm just literally disgusted at you", "You could have gone to knock on her mom\u2019s door? Visited her dad in the hospital and talked to them there? I get that the idea of taking Lexi was to reduce stress on your sister and you wanted to stay out of the way, but visiting would be 100x less intrusive than sending her a picture of her daughter\u2019s shaved head.", "Why did you even ask then? Realize that hundreds of people are saying YTA", "Wow, I only ever get a trim and it's $15.  Granted it takes no where near an hour!", "You should update your post with that timeline.\n\nDid you explain to your niece what was going to happen?", "She had three days to respond.", "She knew and understood, really she just wanted her head to stop hurting. She is pretending to be a minion know", "Did it hurt all the time or just when brushing it? How did it get so matted in just a week?\nYes your niece's hair will grow back. Yes your sister could have gotten back to you in the two days.", "You're fine. She was in pain and you took the appropriate steps to get rid of that pain.\n\nYour sister, on the other hand, doesn't stop being a mother just because something happened to her husband. As a parent who has been through something similar I didn't stop being a parent to my children because I was sad.", "I think it got wet wasn\u2019t brushed out and was thrown up in a in bun without drying it correctly and the normal kid behavior just made it worse.\n\nBrushing was worse with pain but it was pullin on her skull constantly so she was in pain the whole time"]}
