I understand that hair is something that many take pride in and even more so since pride of one's natural hair is often seen as a way to celebrate and be proud of race, but this is not the correct situation for getting on that particular soap box.\n\nIf the child had said no or protested, or if she was not in any discomfort but it had been a matter of you thinking that curly hair is inferior, or you had not tried to speak with her parents or any professionals at all, or anything even remotely like that (which unfortunately does happen and is often seen on other posts on this sub), then you would have been a massive asshole.\n\nHowever, none of that was the case here. You first tried to fix it yourself to the best of your ability, and sought out professional advice. You tried to contact your sister and spoke to your niece. You could not find out your sister's opinion since she didn't respond to you, and your niece seemingly liked her hair but did not attach too much emotional value to it, however she was in pain due to the state of the hair at the time.

However, making a four year old sit still through hours and hours of hair treatments, when said four year old does not attach value to her hair to be motivated to want to do so would be torturous for that child, and the only purpose would be to conform to an aesthetic of what a four year olds hair should look like. If she had wanted to keep her hair the distress of the treatment might have outweighed the distress of the hair loss, but it seems that the only distraught person over the hair loss is the mother, so that is not the case here. \n\nAll in all there are many cases in which curly hair is cut off and it is a terrible thing to do to the person, but in this case you acted in the best interest of the child when the mother could not be bothered to even answer her phone", "NTA.\n\nYour sister was essentially neglecting her child.

She was a wreck because her husband was in the hospital, but i can 100% guarantee she was on her phone at some point during those 3 days. At least once.

Plenty of time for it to grow back in healthy.", "If her head hurt from her hair that means it was BAD, the people at salons know how to deal with different types of hair and the fact that the kid was in pain was a good enough reason to just shave it off.
