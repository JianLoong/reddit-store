I understand that hair is something that many take pride in and even more so since pride of one's natural hair is often seen as a way to celebrate and be proud of race, but this is not the correct situation for getting on that particular soap box.\n\nIf the child had said no or protested, or if she was not in any discomfort but it had been a matter of you thinking that curly hair is inferior, or you had not tried to speak with her parents or any professionals at all, or anything even remotely like that (which unfortunately does happen and is often seen on other posts on this sub), then you would have been a massive asshole.\n\nHowever, none of that was the case here. You first tried to fix it yourself to the best of your ability, and sought out professional advice. You tried to contact your sister and spoke to your niece.

However, making a four year old sit still through hours and hours of hair treatments, when said four year old does not attach value to her hair to be motivated to want to do so would be torturous for that child, and the only purpose would be to conform to an aesthetic of what a four year olds hair should look like. If she had wanted to keep her hair the distress of the treatment might have outweighed the distress of the hair loss, but it seems that the only distraught person over the hair loss is the mother, so that is not the case here. \n\nAll in all there are many cases in which curly hair is cut off and it is a terrible thing to do to the person, but in this case you acted in the best interest of the child when the mother could not be bothered to even answer her phone", "NTA.\n\nYour sister was essentially neglecting her child.

Plenty of time for it to grow back in healthy.", "If her head hurt from her hair that means it was BAD, the people at salons know how to deal with different types of hair and the fact that the kid was in pain was a good enough reason to just shave it off.

It\u2019s easier to blow up at you than hold her own hands up.\nFor all the comments saying it can\u2019t have been that bad - I have super fine hair that curls. My scalp is SO sensitive, even having a hairdresser comb it when it\u2019s tangle free & I\u2019m cringing. I used to DREAD having my mum brush it as a child. I\u2019ve quit having bleach on my hair completely because I can\u2019t cope with having conditioning treatments combed through at the sink at the salon, I used to take nurofen before I went in. I never let it knot, I sleep with it pinned back & have been known to cut matts out rather than brush it from where it\u2019s rubbed against the collar of my coat (lesson learned, my hair is up in a bun or silk scarf in winter if I leave the house now)", "NTA. My 3 year old had a few big matted knots. I tried so many detanglers, conditioners, and oils. Nothing helped and they were getting bigger. I had to cut the matted parts out.

My mom was not the best parent and she hated doing my hair because she never properly learned how to do it without hurting me, which in turn made her even more mad when I would be crying the entire time. Well, one day she got fed up with me crying, handed me the brush and comb, and told me to do it myself. Me, a 4th grader who had never done my hair in my life. So since I didn't want to be in pain, I would just brush the top layer and throw it into a ponytail. \n\nThat was my life for the next 4 years and since I wasn't combing my hair, nor was my mom checking to make sure I did, I ended up with essentially one giant dreadlock. Unfortunately this was before youtube so i couldnt simply look up hair care tutorials. So because of this i couldn't comb my hair, couldn't wash it, it would smell awful, and it made all 3 years of middle school hell for me. Truthfully I'm not sure how no one called CPS to check on us, since i definitely looked neglected. I would beg her to get it done or cut it off, but she never wanted to spend the money on it. I remember I tried cutting it off myself but it was so matted and locked up that I couldn't even get the scissors through. Finally a Saint of a woman who did hair and lived near us begged my mom to let her do my hair, and only when she offered to do it for free did my mom allow it. I had to sit with conditioner and detangler in my hair for an entire day, and even after that she still ended up needing to cut nearly 3/4ths of it off. I know people are saying YTA, but when hair has been neglected to that point, there's seriously not a lot you can do besides chopping some off.
