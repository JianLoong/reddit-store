If you're expected to stay there on your break, that's a terrible spot to be in.

If the company cannot cover you while on break and lose business as a result, that is their problem. If they literally have nobody to watch the store and prevent customers stealing while you are within your rights to leave the premises, then they need to rethink their staff policy. Either fully shut up shop while on break - put \"closed\" on the door, pull down the barriers, kick anybody still inside out - or have someone to hand over to.\n\nYou can try to take breaks at the least impactful time if you want to be kind to your employer.

It makes no sense to have a sign saying \"back in 30\" and you're just there. Go behind the scenes, go to the bathroom, whatever, but don't stand there if you're not serving as you're sending mixed signals.~~", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
