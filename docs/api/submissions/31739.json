Since the group mentioned a fourth person was lagging behind and shortly after there\u2019s someone who comes in saying they\u2019re meeting a group of 3 other people, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that\u2019s the fourth person the group was waiting for, race wouldn\u2019t even play a role in that thought process.\n\nI can also see why they felt racially profiled because, from their perspective, you\u2019re just bringing some asian lady to the table and they don\u2019t know the context of how everything happened.\n\nI also think it is definitely a learning experience and maybe ask more questions in the future before making assumptions (eg do you spot your friend group? That group of people is waiting for someone to join them, is that them? Etc)", "NAH. These diners have probably experienced racial bias and are sensitive to it.

I don't think you meant to hurt anyone but you would be TA if you fail to take the opportunity to become more self aware.", "YTA. i\u2019m not gonna say this was super racist or it makes you a bad person, it was just kind of a dumb move? why wouldn\u2019t you ask the name of their party to make sure instead of telling them to follow you because you made an assumption - which, let\u2019s be honest, was based on their race, even if the math added up. \n\ni don\u2019t agree with them making a big deal out of it, but 100% understandable why they would be pissed and offended in the moment.", "Slight YTA.

That's not racial profiling and those people and your manager acted like idiots.  \n\n\nAs you said, the math added up...and any reasonable person would subconsciously think \"ahhh, relatives...\" or the like.  \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong.  But you did learn a valuable lesson.  There are people out in the world who are just looking for a reason to take out their frustrations on someone.  Next time, make sure you ask something like \"would you like to follow me and see if you can see who you're meeting?\"  Or even \"can you describe them?  I may have seated them earlier.\"", "NTA I\u2019d say it\u2019s an honest mistake. However in future,ask and go by a name not by race.

But at the same time you made assumption based on information you had available and IMO it was a fairly reasonable assumption to make. No decision was made here because of malice. \n\nPut in place some measures so this doesn't happen again, like asking a person to identify who they were joining, or ask them to seat themselves, and then you can avoid this in future.", "NTA - Regardless of race it was natural you thought the 4th showed up.", "NTA. Lol I was expecting some real racist stuff. Like putting the expensive stuff away when certain people come or just refusing service. But this was just an honest mistake.", "Not really but kinda.

I quip, yeah the three of us are white, but we are not together - and other Asian foreigners just laugh - they obviously had experienced that before.

Clearly it was a racial thing. Jfc", "YTA.  This was an \"All Asians look alike.\" joke played out in real life, and I can see why those people were offended by what you did.

Next time, I suggest asking the party's name or letting the customer scan the room.", "NTA: you made an honest mistake, but there's no reason to stay with an employee that screams at you.

Might not be inten racism but still racism", "NTA\n\nPeople who are looking for things to be offended about are the worst.", "YTA. What you did is called a microaggression. Racism isn't always overt or done with malicious intent, sometimes it's just out of ignorance or lack of awareness. You didn't do it out of malice, but it was still racism.

And I don't see anywhere in your post that you apologized, so it really just made you look even worse. From their perspective, it looked like you group them up because they all were Asian. They might not have even been from the same country.\n\nYou said it wasn't a racial thing, but it didn't occur to you that their friends could have been of another race or ethnicity. That's a subconscious bias on your part.\n\nYes, you're in the wrong in *this* situation, but you don't have to be in the future. If you're ever in a situation like this again, with anyone, maybe you can ask the customers to describe who they're meeting. Or maybe you could ask them to point them out.", "NTA.

That's not really what you were doing, right?  It made sense - 3 people waiting on 1 person, 1 person shows up saying they're meeting 3 people - easy assumption to make, regardless of who was what race.

I know it can be a struggle sometimes to tell certain Asian peoples apart, especially if you don't see them in a context often where you know who is who. But if you, say, took a Japanese person to a table of Koreans, they may get confused why you assumed that and feel like you're racist as you can't tell the difference between their ethnic groups. \n\nIf so, imagine if you were in an Asian country and they led you to a table of white folk who (to you) are clearly of a different race. Like leading an American to a table of British folk.

It happens, all the time and most people who have a brain to actively engage would understand the error and chalk it up to a weird coincidence. Similar things happen to me as an early arriver and usually just laugh it off, sometimes get invited to join the prior group and we all have a big laugh, i remember one time wi was led to a table of five dudes and I just leaned on the booth like \"So this feels like a meme I saw once ...\" the waiter was a bit embarrassed, but we laughed it off, they apologized, I reiterated a million times its an honest mistake and both our groups left decent tips and when the other group saw me leaving, they hollared \"Bye memelord!\" and all my friends were like \"WTF?\" and lead into a whole new world of hilarity for us lol", "Imo only AH is the manager, this OP is NTA.

These people came back to complain that you basically took them to the wrong table? They took time out of their day to do that?  It's insane.

I think the only way I could get offended in that situation would be is if I went to a restaurant and said I was there to meet my party and they were like \"say no more.

Maybe learn the definition of a word before throwing around assumptive assertions.\n\n\nRead this and tell me where this meets any of the criteria. \n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racist", "The person I originally replied to absolutely said that OP should have empathy for them, or at least heavily implied it.", "Thank you for sharing the wisdom of \"your own experience\" which involves not being a POC and not having been on the receiving end of a racial microaggression.", "Do *you*, I mean Jesus fucking Christ he led an Asian lady to a table of Asian women just because they were both meeting people, that\u2019s *literally* fucking racist\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02racism doesn\u2019t have to be one of those 3 things, it\u2019s not some black or white clear cut \u201cit\u2019s this or it\u2019s nothing\u201d thing, what a load of bullshit. I\u2019m not saying OP is racist but they 100% did something that is a little bit fucking racist. \n\nOh no not a dictionary link, that\u2019s totally the only 2 examples of racism that exist. There\u2019s totally noooooooo way that there other kinds of racism and ways to be racist that what\u2019s described in this one link to the dictionary. Oh wait\u2026that\u2019s not the end all be all of racism, because there\u2019s definitely more than 2 ways to be racist. Imagine having to explain to somebody that assuming people of the same race who arrived separately are all together is a tiny bit racist. \n\nImagine me saying \u201chey just ask a simple question\u201d is somehow a controversial take, I mean either you want to avoid looking racist or like you don\u2019t I guess but that\u2019s super weird if you ask me. Personally I\u2019m going to try to avoid looking racist, but hey maybe that\u2019s just me\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0fAnyway I know I won\u2019t be changing your mind on this so I\u2019m done my guy", "Okay sorry", "I'm not reading all that shit.\n\n\nIf a group of three white people came in and said they have one more joining them, and someone of any race walked in and said \"i'm joining a party of three\" i would walk them right over to the table of three.
