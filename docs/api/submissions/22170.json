It all went perfectly and I couldn't have asked for a better man to marry. To capture the day, we hired one of my university friends as a photographer since he does it as a side gig and he offered as a wedding present for us.\n\nThis issue concerns my younger brother John. There's one slightly blurry photo where he s having a nap on a chair in the background of the photo while me and our older brother, Tom, dance together in front. It looks exactly like a photo I have when we were younger and at someone else's wedding but we're all kids. When my friend showed me the photo and asked if I wanted it deleted because he didn't notice John asleep in it, I asked him to keep it but put it in a separate folder so it's not in the link everyone else gets to view the photos. Only me and my husband have a copy. He thinks it's cute that the two photos are the same also.\n\nCurrently, that photo hangs in the living room next to the one where we're kids, a side-by-side comparison. It makes me smile whenever I see them because I barely have any photos with both of my brothers. Sure, I have big family ones but none with just them, especially on a day that's so sentimental to me. They're also not the biggest photos on my wall and in the corner. Your eye isn't immediately drawn to them when you look at our main wall.\n\nI didn't think me keeping this photo was a huge deal, no-one else has it and John isn't embarrassed about having narcolepsy at all. However, when he stopped by and saw I'd hung both of the photos up in the living room he got annoyed with me and tried to take them down. We had a small talk about it but ultimately, I left it up there because they remind me of cute moments and having a good time with my brothers on my wedding day. I always hate staged photos and think unexpected moments captured on a camera look nicer anyway.

It's the unsaid things that others don't notice that's upsetting your brother because he knows he's asleep.  Or your brother might be fine with it if it's kept between you guys only.  You already know that it wasn't one to send to everyone else.", "Enjoy the photo, but hang it somewhere else since it bothers him so much. We don\u2019t always know why some family members are sensitive to things that the rest find funny. For him it stirs up something other than a sweet, sentimental memory. Pick out your 2nd favorite wedding photo and display that one. Maybe someday your brother will explain why it bothers him and you can have a nice bonding moment over it.", "INFO - how embarrassing is this picture? Like why did you have the photographer take it out of the folder that everyone can see", "YTA for the way you present it.\n\n\nYou talk about how important it is to have a picture with both your brothers in it. How you love that you have a candid shot with your brother. Reminding you of \"good times\" and \"cute moments\". But your brother HATES IT. It's not a good time to him...it's a miserable time for him, so much that he wants you to take the picture down. You're saying he's not embarrassed of his narcolepsy, but it sounds like he is and you just think it's \"cute\".\n\n\nYou wouldn't be an AH if you just thought it was a great picture of you and your older brother and your younger brother just happened to be in the background. But stop pretending you actually care about your brother and having \"good times\" with him, when he obviously hated this experience of falling asleep.", "I might catch a little heat for this, but NTA. Unless his trousers are around his ankles or he\u2019s drooling in the photo, it\u2019s really not all that embarrassing. \n\nIf I saw a picture like that where I was in background asleep, I\u2019d probably have a laugh and move on with my life. \n\nMaybe I\u2019d be a little miffed if it was a photo on display in the Getty, but not in my sister\u2019s home.", "nta but could you move them to an office or something less prominent?", "NTA. But maybe move the photos to your bedroom or your laundry room if he feels that strongly about it? You can always move them back to your living room once he gets over it", "Out of niceness to your brother, it would be good to move the photo to another room. It embarrasses him. It might embarrass the average person.", "INFO - He went over to your house, saw the pictures on your wall, and tattled on you to your mother? And now your mother wants you to change the decor in your own home?", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your photos, your home.", "NTA -From your story, your brother definitely seems like he's overreacting.", "NAH you could get him removed from the picture. There are people who do that kind of stuff.", "NTA  \nYour photo in your house? Why would someone else get to make a decision about what you choose to display on your walls?", "Could just edit him out", "NTA  They're precious family photos hanging in your home.

It\u2019s your photo, it\u2019s not inappropriate and it\u2019s great you enjoy it. \n\nAs somebody who can\u2019t stomach looking at photos of herself as a child due to severe childhood trauma (yes I know to a lot of people it doesn\u2019t make sense, but I live with it despite therapy so.. idk what to tell you) maybe it strikes an icky chord for him he\u2019d rather not have to look at. You never know why something bothers somebody and if it bothers him that deeply it\u2019s worth taking into consideration.", "NAH. I can understand why he doesn\u2019t want a picture of him, being slightly vulnerable and unaware, to be hanging up for so many people to see so maybe you could try and compromise on the placement.", "NTA. It\u2019s in your own private home and in a small corner. We all have embarrassing photos, especially of family members. I also have funny photos of my brother sleeping in funny positions at the back of the car, or making cutesy faces at stuffed toys.", "YTA, it\u2019s not up to you to determine what\u2019s embarrassing to him. It\u2019s just good manners to not use photos that someone hates. He doesn\u2019t owe you an explanation, all he needed to do is tell you it makes him uncomfortable and embarrasses him. Which he did. Be respectful to your own brother because what you might see as a \u201ccute\u201d moment is clearly a huge source of embarrassment for him.", "Look. Your brother lives his whole life with a condition he has little to no control of and is utterly at its mercy. It\u2019s changed his entire life and what he can and can\u2019t do. You think oh, haha, there is John being cute again and dozing off. He probably hates that he can\u2019t control it and that fact that you not only documented it but pulled yet another example to frame and laugh at has to be very insulting. Move the picture FFS. YTA.", "I was with you until you mentioned your brother has narcolepsy. I really think that changes things and he\u2019s obviously sensitive about it, even if you think he\u2019s \u201cnot embarrassed\u201d about it. \n\nSo I do think your being a bit of an asshole.", "Because he has narcolepsy, that OP claims he isn't embarrassed about, but he obviously is if he's asking her to take down a picture of him falling asleep, which she thinks is \"good times\" and \"cute memories\".", "I don't think it's embarrassing for him at all, he's just staring at the ground really hard. I had it taken out because it doesn't really make sense as to why i'd keep it unless you know the context which only I do since I've got the picture when we were kids", "You're jumping to some conclusions here. My brother doesn't hate the photo and he isn't embarrassed of his narcolepsy. He's very vocal about it and when we were teens he'd joke about falling asleep to get out of chores and things.  If he really was embarrassed by it, the photo wouldn't have made it onto the wall", "No there's nothing in it that is like him drooling. He just looks like he's staring at the ground really hard. It's almost professional in the way he sits", "It was me who let my mum know. In the family chat (me, my brothers and parents), I posted a photo of them next to each other and said it was so cute and John chimed in asking to take them down again and our mum sided with him. Tom and our dad think its funny", "It would have defeated the point though. All 3 of us wouldn't have been in it and it wouldn't have looked like the old photo.", "Lot of assumptions there. He laughs and jokes about sleeping to get out of stuff. He doesn't hate it in the slightest, we'd know if he did", "You need to quit thinking from your point of view. Your NTA for keeping the photo for yourself, but you are for dismissing your brother's concerns about it being displayed. \n\nYou keep claiming that he's not embarrassed about his narcolepsy, but he has clearly told you this is making him uncomfortable and is doing everything but point blank saying it's embarrassing for him, yet you keep ignoring what he's saying and just acting like you know better than him about how he feels on the subject. That's really ablest and patronizing. \n\nHe may be open about his disability but still uncomfortable with it especially when a moment like that is being immortalized and displayed.", "Why you dont photoshop him out ? Problem solved \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "They think \"it's funny\". Don't you think that's what the problem is. He has narcolepsy - a disability, and they think its funny.\n\nTake the photos down.", "Just read the whole thing and def not the asshole for keeping but kinda the ah for putting somewhere everyone that visits can see. Probably better to have it somewhere only you and family can see it.", "He isn't embarrassed though. An embarrassed person wouldn't talk about it a lot and make jokes about falling asleep to get out of things", "Because the reason OP likes the picture is the same reason her brother is humiliated by it. She finds it \"cute\" to laugh at his narcolepsy.", "Exactly. I don't understand all the people who are saying OP isn't an AH. She says John \"isn't embarrassed\" about it, but he obviously is. And that it's a \"cute moment\" and \"good times\" and special memories and all that BS.....but it isn't any of that for him. This isn't a picture of him enjoying his sister's wedding. And he wasn't enjoying the one as a kid either. She just think it's hilarious that he has narcolepsy.", "He thinks it's funny too that he falls asleep. He'd joke about it, saying he can use it to get out of stuff", "Yeah this is just a post to give people a free pass to be ableist."]}
