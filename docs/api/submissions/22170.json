To capture the day, we hired one of my university friends as a photographer since he does it as a side gig and he offered as a wedding present for us.\n\nThis issue concerns my younger brother John. There's one slightly blurry photo where he s having a nap on a chair in the background of the photo while me and our older brother, Tom, dance together in front. It looks exactly like a photo I have when we were younger and at someone else's wedding but we're all kids. When my friend showed me the photo and asked if I wanted it deleted because he didn't notice John asleep in it, I asked him to keep it but put it in a separate folder so it's not in the link everyone else gets to view the photos.

We had a small talk about it but ultimately, I left it up there because they remind me of cute moments and having a good time with my brothers on my wedding day.

It\u2019s easier to say don\u2019t joke about my height than it is about a medical condition that can make people uncomfortable. He\u2019s probably trying to make it less awkward when it happens.

I feel bad for your brother.", "I think you should talk to him about a compromise like hanging it in a private area like your bedroom.

He's put up some boundaries, but all of you just seem to find other reasons to pick on him.\n\nHe said he was uncomfortable, but you didn't listen, which I suspect is a family thing. \nHe is probably so tired of dealing with all of you and is just throwing up his hands in defeat.\n\nStart listening to his feelings for once.\nYou all seem to get a sadistic pleasure out of hurting him.\nYour whole family sucks.", "Well I don't think it would be cute if he was seizing in the back of the photo. \n\nProbably bad wording on my part but more funny as in it's the exact same scenario over a decade later. I think it's cute that we have the same photo but we're adults. Similar to recreating old photos my Dad and I have but with my future kids someday. \n\nMe and John are extremely close, not an ah to him at all", "There are things he's sensitive about though and we've changed our behaviour accordingly once he's told us.

Maybe he accepted that he has no control over his condition and jokes about it. I can see your point too, it's a sweet photo in this context. But he is bothered by it, and maybe he is too embarrassed to admit it. It's probably the only thing he is too embarrassed to admit that it bothers him since you said he was vocal about other stuff and you and your family stopped the teasing. \n\nNAH, because I can't call any of you an AH, just put yourself in his shoes for a minute and see things from his perspective.", "There's no assumption.

YTA\n\nThis isn't because he just decided to take a nap.  This is because of a ***medical condition***.  \n\nYou're acting like it was a funny little thing.  It isn't to him.  This is a reminder that he has less physical control of his body and that you think that's funny.  \n\nKeep the photo, but hang it somewhere private instead.   Not for guests.   \n\nAnd learn to respect the medical conditions of other people.", "Why did you even ask if you don't want to listen what people have to say?\n\nYes YTA.

Either through cropping the photo or photoshop.", "YTA for all the reasons people are saying and also for being so obtuse and arguing the same thing back to people over and over, deliberately ignoring the truth about his embarrassment.", "YTA, and doubling down in your replies just confirms that. You're being incredibly inconsiderate and literally just thinking about things from your own point of view, and are deflecting every single comment and criticism.\n\nIf you think what you did was so perfect, why are you even posting here?", "\ud83d\ude1e\ud83c\udfc5", "I would say deliberately and tenaciously obtuse.", "I agree with moving the photos, but there should be no expectation that he will \u201cget over it\u201d.

Which one?", "Everyone is telling you YTA because obviously his reaction shows you he\u2019s uncomfortable and you couldn\u2019t care less. You\u2019re here asking a question & arguing with everyone who defends your brother, don\u2019t expect to come here for an objective opinion & expect to be coddled. You could at least move the photos to a private area of the house where guests won\u2019t see it and put another photo there, but you sound too unempathetic to be considerate of his feelings and realize he may not be as cavalier about his condition as he seems.", "Right?

Sometimes people just look like they zone out for a while whilst they\u2019re seizing. They\u2019d look very similar to your brother in the photo. Still cute?

What\u2019s the difference?", "> If he really was embarrassed by it, the photo wouldn't have made it onto the wall\n\nSo why exactly do you think he wanted it off the wall?", "Why did you even come here to ask?", "I read this quickly on my lunch break earlier and must\u2019ve skimmed over the mention of narcolepsy. Brother definitely has a right to feel the way he does about it. I do think OP\u2019s intentions with the photo were innocent but after rereading the post and now some of OP\u2019s comments, it seems like they just came to this sub for validation and are upset that people are siding with the brother. In one comment they claim not to host people, but obviously they were hosting the brother at some point for him to have seen the photos and ask for them to be removed. Maybe he doesn\u2019t want to be reminded of his narcolepsy anytime he visits his siblings home. The kind and supportive thing for OP to do would be to move the photos to a more private area. My judgment has changed from n t a to NAH at best, maybe YTA if OP decides not to move the photos.", "Then put it somewhere 'not public's like their bedroom.

I was not ok. \n\nNow that I am ok, I don\u2019t joke about it because I don\u2019t need to. Self deprecation is a coping mechanism. This is extremely common behaviour and for whatever reason you are CHOOSING to pretend you don\u2019t understand that. \n\nYou\u2019re displaying a photo on your wall of your brother having an attack. If the picture was exactly the same, but the condition was epilepsy instead of narcolepsy, would you display a picture on your wall of your brother in mid seizure even if it only looked like he was staring really hard at the ground? If he\u2019d spent years making fun of himself for \u201cspazzing out\u201d on purpose when chores came up? I don\u2019t think you would. \n\nI think you\u2019ve completely minimized his condition in your mind because it\u2019s just sleeping and not something you consider to be \u201cactually\u201d debilitating. Narcolepsy is very difficult to live with, and displaying a picture on your wall of your brother in mid attack is honestly awful. \n\nYou need to grow up and do some true self reflection. \n\nAnd all of that aside\u2026your brother is truly upset by this and he doesn\u2019t have a history of being a drama Queen. How hard is it to move it to another room, or put it in an album, even if you still think you\u2019re right?

YTA", "Wow, you are dense.", "Me and my sister make hella dark jokes about the horrible things that happened to us. That's doesn't mean we are happy or fine with it. It's just a way of us coping. If someone else was to use what happened to us for their own entertainment though it would be awful.", "Why are you here if you're going to argue against every response you don't like?

You refused, and he tried to take it down himself, again you refused. Your actions contradict your statement. You aren't being truthful and I can only assume this isn't an isolated incident. I wonder how many other times you've done this to your brother under the guise of \"joking\". YTA and you're mean. This is bully- esque behavior.", "You literally wrote a whole story about it.  \n\nYou laughed about the photo even though he's directly telling you he's not ok with this.  You're not listening at all.  \n\nWhy TF would he want the photo off the wall if it didn't bother him?", "Yaaaaaa", "This brother is the family punching bag. I hope he can get away from them and heal.", "Does it matter? \nYou claim that whenever someone in your family had made fun of something and he didn't like it he asked them to stop and they did, but now he's asking you to stop and you won't. \nYou made it clear you don't think it's due to his disability, but even if there were a sliver of a chance that it is because of his disability why fight it?\nDo you think it's soooo cute that his disability is on display or that you caught another episode on camera? Or do you relish in the thought that your brother missed out on part of your wedding because he's disabled?\nIt's not very loving or kind to dismiss his feelings, especially when you can put the photos where only you can see them.", "This whole question is bizarre. He told you he wants it taken down. People have suggested reasons on why he\u2019d want it taken down. You say no way that\u2019s not the reason, if it was the reason then you\u2019d take it down.

You've got to be doing this on purpose at this point.   The reason it ***isn't funny*** is because this is an ongoing medical issue he will have the rest of his life.   You're acting like that popping up multiple times is what makes it funny - but it's the opposite.  That's what makes it not ok at all.", "Dude... you keep making excuses, but just like the other person said, he literally tried to take it down when he saw it. Doesn't that tell you something?"]}
