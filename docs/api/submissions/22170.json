To capture the day, we hired one of my university friends as a photographer since he does it as a side gig and he offered as a wedding present for us.\n\nThis issue concerns my younger brother John. There's one slightly blurry photo where he s having a nap on a chair in the background of the photo while me and our older brother, Tom, dance together in front. It looks exactly like a photo I have when we were younger and at someone else's wedding but we're all kids. When my friend showed me the photo and asked if I wanted it deleted because he didn't notice John asleep in it, I asked him to keep it but put it in a separate folder so it's not in the link everyone else gets to view the photos. Only me and my husband have a copy. He thinks it's cute that the two photos are the same also.\n\nCurrently, that photo hangs in the living room next to the one where we're kids, a side-by-side comparison. It makes me smile whenever I see them because I barely have any photos with both of my brothers. Sure, I have big family ones but none with just them, especially on a day that's so sentimental to me. They're also not the biggest photos on my wall and in the corner. Your eye isn't immediately drawn to them when you look at our main wall.\n\nI didn't think me keeping this photo was a huge deal, no-one else has it and John isn't embarrassed about having narcolepsy at all. However, when he stopped by and saw I'd hung both of the photos up in the living room he got annoyed with me and tried to take them down. We had a small talk about it but ultimately, I left it up there because they remind me of cute moments and having a good time with my brothers on my wedding day.

It\u2019s easier to say don\u2019t joke about my height than it is about a medical condition that can make people uncomfortable. He\u2019s probably trying to make it less awkward when it happens. It doesn\u2019t need it documented for posterity. He told you it bothered him and you brushed him off. You are an asshole for that.

Instead you do what you\u2019ve done your whole life and just rationalize that it\u2019s not a big deal to him even though he told you he wanted it taken down or at least moved. I feel bad for your brother.", "I think you should talk to him about a compromise like hanging it in a private area like your bedroom. Maybe he is upset at himself because he tried really hard not to fall asleep during your wedding, or maybe he sees something you don't but for now I would take it down until you talk to him and respect what he has asked", "YTA\n\nIf it was a compromising picture of you you would understand.", "OP could you guys lie and say it was staged?

He's put up some boundaries, but all of you just seem to find other reasons to pick on him.\n\nHe said he was uncomfortable, but you didn't listen, which I suspect is a family thing. \nHe is probably so tired of dealing with all of you and is just throwing up his hands in defeat.\n\nStart listening to his feelings for once.\nYou all seem to get a sadistic pleasure out of hurting him.\nYour whole family sucks.", "Well I don't think it would be cute if he was seizing in the back of the photo. \n\nProbably bad wording on my part but more funny as in it's the exact same scenario over a decade later. I think it's cute that we have the same photo but we're adults. Similar to recreating old photos my Dad and I have but with my future kids someday. \n\nMe and John are extremely close, not an ah to him at all", "There are things he's sensitive about though and we've changed our behaviour accordingly once he's told us.

Why were you willing to change your behavior before but not this time?", "*He* can joke about it. Doesn\u2019t mean you should.", "Sometimes, people make jokes about themselves as a coping mechanism. Maybe he accepted that he has no control over his condition and jokes about it. I can see your point too, it's a sweet photo in this context. But he is bothered by it, and maybe he is too embarrassed to admit it. It's probably the only thing he is too embarrassed to admit that it bothers him since you said he was vocal about other stuff and you and your family stopped the teasing. \n\nNAH, because I can't call any of you an AH, just put yourself in his shoes for a minute and see things from his perspective.", "There's no assumption.

I literally said multiple times that she should take it down? Are you American? Is this why your reading comprehension is so bad? \n\nI just take issue with all of the assumptions people are making.", "Okay. I just believe good, loving family deserves an explanation and not just demands.", "Are you, like, actually lacking in reading comprehension skills or are you being deliberately obtuse? \n\nHe could easily explain \u201chey this makes me upset because of my narcolepsy/it\u2019s an ugly photo/i look fat do you mind taking it down?\u201d \n\nHis sister would comply.", "Yes but we still don\u2019t actually know the reason why he doesn\u2019t like the photo, do we? You know what they say about assumptions! \n\nI fell asleep once at my reception, twice getting ready. There\u2019s about two dozen photos (both professional and taken on peoples\u2019 phones like selfies and jokey photos) of me asleep while I was getting ready. The two times getting ready I passed out totally unexpectedly but at my reception I knew I was getting drowsy and excused myself. I still missed 2+ hours of my own reception. I was very bummed about that. \n\nI still believe wholeheartedly that good family is owed an explanation and not just demands - no matter how justified you believe your demands to be. If you\u2019re willing to blow up family ties over silly things such as this, so be it.\n\nPeople get so annoyed when disabled people don\u2019t jump on their bandwagon to support their arguments. It\u2019s almost like that\u2019s all we\u2019re here for \ud83d\ude02", "If you walk into your family members house and try to take a picture of yourself off the wall they\u2019re probably going to ask you to stop.", "oh no! you called me an american! how will i ever recover?", "He's already asked her to take it down and she literally knows why. Her family are calling her for the same reason... \n\nThey don't all think he's just upset he doesn't look good. You're telling other people it's their comprehension but the whole of this reddit thread KNOWS its because of his narcolepsy and could tell immediately, and even you do right? You're not an idiot and you can realise that from the post right?... So why do you think OP doesn't? Think she's totally oblivious or something?\n\n\"My brother is upset I have a photo of him falling asleep because of his narcolepsy whilst me and my other brother have fun at my wedding and dance in the picture at the front of it... he's totally not sensitive about his narcolepsy... I can't tell why he wants it taken down and so haven't taken it down... now my parents are calling me to take it down... but im right, right reddit?\" She's got some cognitive comprehension issues if that's what she really thinks. She wouldn't even mention it in the post if she didn't think it was related. You've got to be lacking in comprehension if you don't think from that post that she knows. Most men I know don't give a shit if they have a bit of a bad photo... if I have a picture of them where they're vulnerable and showing an illness though? Not so much. Most men I know dont want to admit they're weak or vulnerable with things like this where society teaches them to be the opposite and a strong or protector like character. Instead he's displaying his cognitive/brain condition in a photo at a big family event where his other siblings are dancing and having fun in front of him. It's just common sense to understand that imo and not cause huge drama over it by refusing to take the picture down. OP has to have some sort of brain impairment to not see that.", "He tried to physically remove Them But she put Them back, How is that listening? Why are you defending an AH so hard?", "i agree it's pretty weird that this was what he immediately resorted to, but OP's refusal to take the photo down when he asked indicates to me that he suspected he wouldn't get anywhere with asking her (not to mention all the doubling down she's doing here & her flat out refusal to even entertain the idea that the photo makes him uncomfortable, opting instead to argue with every point or suggestion anyone tries to make)"]}
