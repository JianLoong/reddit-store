To capture the day, we hired one of my university friends as a photographer since he does it as a side gig and he offered as a wedding present for us.\n\nThis issue concerns my younger brother John. There's one slightly blurry photo where he s having a nap on a chair in the background of the photo while me and our older brother, Tom, dance together in front. It looks exactly like a photo I have when we were younger and at someone else's wedding but we're all kids. When my friend showed me the photo and asked if I wanted it deleted because he didn't notice John asleep in it, I asked him to keep it but put it in a separate folder so it's not in the link everyone else gets to view the photos.

He thinks it's cute that the two photos are the same also.\n\nCurrently, that photo hangs in the living room next to the one where we're kids, a side-by-side comparison. It makes me smile whenever I see them because I barely have any photos with both of my brothers. Sure, I have big family ones but none with just them, especially on a day that's so sentimental to me. They're also not the biggest photos on my wall and in the corner. Your eye isn't immediately drawn to them when you look at our main wall.\n\nI didn't think me keeping this photo was a huge deal, no-one else has it and John isn't embarrassed about having narcolepsy at all. However, when he stopped by and saw I'd hung both of the photos up in the living room he got annoyed with me and tried to take them down. We had a small talk about it but ultimately, I left it up there because they remind me of cute moments and having a good time with my brothers on my wedding day.

I also have funny photos of my brother sleeping in funny positions at the back of the car, or making cutesy faces at stuffed toys.", "YTA, it\u2019s not up to you to determine what\u2019s embarrassing to him. It\u2019s just good manners to not use photos that someone hates. He doesn\u2019t owe you an explanation, all he needed to do is tell you it makes him uncomfortable and embarrasses him. Which he did. Be respectful to your own brother because what you might see as a \u201ccute\u201d moment is clearly a huge source of embarrassment for him.", "Look. Your brother lives his whole life with a condition he has little to no control of and is utterly at its mercy. It\u2019s changed his entire life and what he can and can\u2019t do. You think oh, haha, there is John being cute again and dozing off. He probably hates that he can\u2019t control it and that fact that you not only documented it but pulled yet another example to frame and laugh at has to be very insulting. Move the picture FFS.

I had it taken out because it doesn't really make sense as to why i'd keep it unless you know the context which only I do since I've got the picture when we were kids", "You're jumping to some conclusions here. My brother doesn't hate the photo and he isn't embarrassed of his narcolepsy. He's very vocal about it and when we were teens he'd joke about falling asleep to get out of chores and things.  If he really was embarrassed by it, the photo wouldn't have made it onto the wall", "No there's nothing in it that is like him drooling. He just looks like he's staring at the ground really hard.

In the family chat (me, my brothers and parents), I posted a photo of them next to each other and said it was so cute and John chimed in asking to take them down again and our mum sided with him.

He laughs and jokes about sleeping to get out of stuff. He doesn't hate it in the slightest, we'd know if he did", "You need to quit thinking from your point of view. Your NTA for keeping the photo for yourself, but you are for dismissing your brother's concerns about it being displayed. \n\nYou keep claiming that he's not embarrassed about his narcolepsy, but he has clearly told you this is making him uncomfortable and is doing everything but point blank saying it's embarrassing for him, yet you keep ignoring what he's saying and just acting like you know better than him about how he feels on the subject. That's really ablest and patronizing. \n\nHe may be open about his disability but still uncomfortable with it especially when a moment like that is being immortalized and displayed.", "Why you dont photoshop him out ? Problem solved \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "They think \"it's funny\". Don't you think that's what the problem is. He has narcolepsy - a disability, and they think its funny.\n\nTake the photos down.", "Just read the whole thing and def not the asshole for keeping but kinda the ah for putting somewhere everyone that visits can see. Probably better to have it somewhere only you and family can see it.", "He isn't embarrassed though. An embarrassed person wouldn't talk about it a lot and make jokes about falling asleep to get out of things", "Because the reason OP likes the picture is the same reason her brother is humiliated by it. She finds it \"cute\" to laugh at his narcolepsy.", "Exactly. I don't understand all the people who are saying OP isn't an AH. She says John \"isn't embarrassed\" about it, but he obviously is. And that it's a \"cute moment\" and \"good times\" and special memories and all that BS.....but it isn't any of that for him. This isn't a picture of him enjoying his sister's wedding.

If your brother was epileptic and having a seizure in the background, would you find that cute? Even if his epilepsy didn\u2019t bother him, because a disability is nothing to be ashamed of? Highlighting it because it is funny to you makes me thing you are not just the AH here, but also likely in general to your brother.\n\n(My brother does have epilepsy and narcolepsy and I could not imagine doing what you did.)", "YTA you do know people use humor as a coping mechanism for their disabilities. Have some empathy for your brother, put the picture somewhere else.", "If he wants them down, it probably means it embarasses him or hurts his feelings. I'd take down the pictures. Maybe put them in a keepsake album. I'm sure he is precious in both pics, but it's not worth having them on your walls if they make him feel sad.", "YTA because you are being completely obtuse Anne dismissive of his feelings. You say he doesn\u2019t care about his condition, but it clearly asking you to take down a picture representing his condition. I\u2019m so happy you find it \u201ccute\u201d but clearly he doesn\u2019t", "YTA. He is probably okay with the jokes, but not the documentation of it especially since he\u2019s not cognizant during the events. I might joke about having gotten too drunk and then be uncomfortable with a video of it being shared around. It\u2019s a bad example and yet not bc it\u2019s my choice to drink too much, but not his choice to have narcolepsy. I\u2019m still uncomfortable. He\u2019s allowed to be uncomfortable. It\u2019s easier to say don\u2019t joke about my height than it is about a medical condition that can make people uncomfortable. He\u2019s probably trying to make it less awkward when it happens. It doesn\u2019t need it documented for posterity. He told you it bothered him and you brushed him off. You are an asshole for that. Just bc in the past things were one way do not give you the right to stomp on someone in the present. If you love your brother you will listen to him. Not just say idc about your feelings the pictures are more important??? Think about that for a second.", "Your brother clearly doesn\u2019t want those photos on full display where anyone who visits your home will see them.\n\nMove them to your bedroom so you can enjoy them every day privately.  If you\u2019re not willing to do that, then you\u2019re being extremely insensitive to a brother you claim to care about. It doesn\u2019t matter what he said in the past or if you feel he\u2019s not embarrassed. He\u2019s telling you how he feels now.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t respect him enough to take down the photos or move them to a more private area, then YTA.", "YTA and seriously cruel to your brother and don\u2019t even realize it. I feel sorry for your brother for having to put up with the jokes and teasing all his life that he\u2019s probably had to live with and deal with by pretending it doesn\u2019t hurt him. He told you he doesn\u2019t want it up displayed there \u2026 that should be enough since you should care about your brother\u2019s feelings. Instead you do what you\u2019ve done your whole life and just rationalize that it\u2019s not a big deal to him even though he told you he wanted it taken down or at least moved. I feel bad for your brother.", "I think you should talk to him about a compromise like hanging it in a private area like your bedroom. Maybe he is upset at himself because he tried really hard not to fall asleep during your wedding, or maybe he sees something you don't but for now I would take it down until you talk to him and respect what he has asked", "YTA\n\nIf it was a compromising picture of you you would understand.", "OP could you guys lie and say it was staged? Would that make everyone happy? If your brother says no to that then I\u2019d take it down but maybe that could be a decent compromise.", "NTA, but prob just move the picstures somewhere else like not the first wall if that\u2019s where they are :)", "NAH.  If the picture bothers John and you want to display the photo, couldn\u2019t you just photoshop John out of it and reprint it?", "How about moving the photos to your bedroom or study where you can enjoy them but they won't be on display for everyone to see.", "Your family seems to always pick on your brother. He's put up some boundaries, but all of you just seem to find other reasons to pick on him.\n\nHe said he was uncomfortable, but you didn't listen, which I suspect is a family thing. \nHe is probably so tired of dealing with all of you and is just throwing up his hands in defeat.\n\nStart listening to his feelings for once.\nYou all seem to get a sadistic pleasure out of hurting him.\nYour whole family sucks.", "Well I don't think it would be cute if he was seizing in the back of the photo. \n\nProbably bad wording on my part but more funny as in it's the exact same scenario over a decade later. I think it's cute that we have the same photo but we're adults. Similar to recreating old photos my Dad and I have but with my future kids someday. \n\nMe and John are extremely close, not an ah to him at all", "There are things he's sensitive about though and we've changed our behaviour accordingly once he's told us. He hasn't done that with his narcolepsy and makes jokes so i'm pretty sure he isn't sensitive about it", "We don't really have an office. Just the main bedroom, kitchen and living room and our bedroom is cluttered enough as is", "OP's brother asked to get the photo taken down. OP could easily photoshop and reprint it. OP is TA.", "OP could absolutely get it photoshoped and reprinted, but won't because OP finds it funny and is an AH. OP's brother was embarrassed by the photo and asked to take it down. Just look at all of OP's replies.", "Well, his opinion of how close you are may differ if you keep being an AH.", "Ok but he literally told you he was sensitive about that picture. Why were you willing to change your behavior before but not this time?", "*He* can joke about it. Doesn\u2019t mean you should.", "Sometimes, people make jokes about themselves as a coping mechanism. Maybe he accepted that he has no control over his condition and jokes about it. I can see your point too, it's a sweet photo in this context. But he is bothered by it, and maybe he is too embarrassed to admit it. It's probably the only thing he is too embarrassed to admit that it bothers him since you said he was vocal about other stuff and you and your family stopped the teasing. \n\nNAH, because I can't call any of you an AH, just put yourself in his shoes for a minute and see things from his perspective.", "There's no assumption. He is *telling you* his feelings. Holy shit.", "He's told you he's embarrassed of it. Sometimes people joke about things themselves that they are sensitive to if someone else mentions it.", "Is your fucking brain broken? He literally tried to take them down himself.", "You have no idea how he really feels. Someone\u2019s making jokes about themselves doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re totally secure and definitely don\u2019t have any hang ups about their condition.", "Now that it's in the family chat they can all copy it and it will show up other places.", "We're going out for lunch tomorrow so probably not", "Well Tom and our dad used to tease him for being short and he told them and they knocked it off. They didn't realise it hurt him so much and stopped. I think he would have done that with his narcolepsy if that was the case", "An embarrassed person absolutely would, this is human behaviour 101.", "You\u2019re wrong.

Make light of it so no one else does.", "Are you new to humor?", "Someone who\u2019s not embarrassed wouldn\u2019t try to take it down himself from your wall.", "This was n a h  for me to start with, but now, you are fully YTA.\n\nYou brother told you he found the pictures embarrassing and asked you to take them down. You *laughed and refused.*\n\nMaybe your brother isn't embarrassed by his narcolepsy. More power to him for that, because it's not his fault.  However, he is embarrassed by these pictures and has told you so. So take them down and apologise for being dense.", "I make jokes about the abuse my family experienced at the hands of my father. Doesn't mean I want to frame a picture where my mum has a black eye. \n\nIt's still a sensitive issue regardless.", "He is embarrassed.  Christ, making jokes is a coping mechanism when you're uncomfortable!. \nLearn to read the room!", "You asked a question, and apparently don't like the answers.  \n\nShow him this post tomorrow and ask him to read through the comments (which include your own), and then tell you what his true feelings are.", "He told you just now, and you laughed.", "He literally tried to remove the picture. Use your fucking brain and figure out what that means. Here's a hint. He doesn't want the picture hanging up.", "Not when he's told us about topics he's uncomfortable with that we've joked about and then we've knocked it off. He knows he can say if he's uncomfortable with anything and we stop", "Where did you get that from?", "You are being incredibly obtuse.\n\nWhat is your rheory on why he wants you to take it down then? B/c he hates your family? B/c nostalgia sucks? B/c he doesn't like being in photograps?\n\nOr is it more likely that he doesn't only want to be known by everyone who walks on your living room as the guy who falls asleep all the time.", "This whole post. He told you he is uncomfortable with this picture, and you, your father, and Tom just laugh at him and talk about \"good times\".", "The part where he literally tried to remove the picture. Are you truly this dense?", "The part where he's literally telling you he's uncomfortable with your behavior and choices?", "I don't know why he doesn't want the photo up. My husband and I don't host. He knows this.", "I agree. He's so uncomfortable he tried to take the pictures down in your home and you had to stop him. I think you should move them. \nWhile you were having a good time, he's dealing with his condition and it sounds like you all make fun of him for it. \nI'd give anything to have my only brother back, he passed 13 years ago. I can't imagine making fun of him over a serious condition or dismissing his wishes by displaying that condition so blatantly for anyone who comes to your house to see. Because it will be brought up in simple conversation and you will explain to everyone his condition.\nYTA", "Yeah funny as in it's crazy we have the same photo but it's 15 years later", "So, you don't know why and yet you refuse to believe the, by far,  the most likely answer.\n\nFYI - it is not uncommon for a person to make fun of themselves for the thing they are most embarrassed about. It is a self-protection mechanism. It is also not uncommon to not want to admit the thing you are moat vulnerable about b/c it exposes you. It wouldn't be out of the ordinary at all for your brother to be embarrassed about narcolepsy and not say anything but be willing to confront other things that he doesn't like, but isn't nearly as vunerable with.", "I get what you mean by that but it really doesn't look like he's even asleep. Literally just that he could be looking at something on the floor but we've seen him fall asleep so often that we know it's that. \n\nWe don't really host, our place is too small. So there's no one to explain it to", "Because.....he still has narcolepsy?\n\n\nI have plenty of embarrassing moments when I was a kid, which I definitely wouldn't want to recreate. It's funny to you, because you're not the one who embarrassed.", "Thats kinda how having a chronic sleep disorder works smart guy.", "You're not listening to what he's telling you and you're clearly not going to listen to anyone on here either. While you're dancing away, he's dealing with his condition. He asked you to remove the pictures. It's so simple to move them for him. You grew up with a brother with narcolepsy. He grew up and is still dealing with narcolepsy. Your experiences and memories of the same event are so vastly different, you can't comprehend what he goes through or the embarrassment it probably causes him. I feel sorry for your brother if your family treats him the way you do.", "Why do you hate your brother?", "No funny as in it's a coincidence funny. The chairs in the back, the lighting, the same dance moves me and Tom are doing. Funny how time repeats itself. \n\nHe doesn't look like he is asleep in it though. We just know because we've seen it happen so many times. It looks like he's just looking at something on the ground."]}
