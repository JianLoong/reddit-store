You sure your mom wasn\u2019t using it to?", "NTA, if you're buying. They don't need your nice perfume. You probably do need a hair dryer.", "NTA - It seems obvious where your sisters get their disrespectful attitude to other people's stuff. The difference is that they are kids and your mother is, embarrassingly, an adult.", "NTA. Odd your mom has a problem with you locking up your things, but not your sisters taking your things. Hopefully you're able to go off to college soon, and take everything important with you.", "NTA. Your mom is just angry at at you for so plainly pointing out her failure to effectively parent your siblings. Parenting is hard, and it\u2019s probably a sign to her that she\u2019s slacking, even though she may be trying her hardest.", "NTA. Just doing what your parents won't. Protecting your stuff.", "NTA What's wrong with your mum? I agree with you, she is having an attitude. Why is she acting so immaturw, isn't she supposed to be the grownup? I bet she wouldn't like to have her stuff stolen either, so there's no need for reacting that way. \n\nIs this a typical reaction of hers? I surely hope you're usually being treated more accordingly!", "NTA. Your sisters keep using your stuff and disregard your instructions not to. Your mum hasn\u2019t done anything to enforce consequences. She\u2019s being petty.", "NTA, I\u2019m thinking you might be surprised at how much your Mom as actually taking your things.", "NTA.", "NTA. You should be allowed to treat yourself to small \"luxuries\" like perfume and snacks without your little sisters raiding them without asking. Your mom is abdicating her responsibility to tell your sibs that it's not OK to take other people's things without asking. Her comparing scent you bought yourself as a treat to home appliances is bizarre! She sounds like she's equating \"I want some privacy\" to \"I'm doing terrible things behind your back\" when really, most of us just enjoy and need some things to keep to ourselves, whether they're thoughts or items. I can't wait to see what sort of lockboxes she buys for all the appliances! (Spoiler alert: She's making empty threats to get you to obey.)", "NTA\n\nHow about just stopping buying it until you can move on your own, by that time you will have a nice sum of money.\n\nOr do it halfway, keep somethings locked/hidden and keep openly/badly hidden meh stuff", "NTA", "NTA. Move out asap", "NTA. These things belong to you. You said no the sibs couldn\u2019t use them and they ignored you. The lockbox was necessary to keep your things safe. Are you the black sheep of the family? I assume your the eldest, some parents coddle the oldest, some coddle the youngest. Mom could be being harassed by the siblings and is lashing out at you over the irritation or she honesty views your belongings as family property. I\u2019d suggest you have a heart to heart with your mom about the whole issue. What does dad think? Definitely NTA!", "NTA, your sister are stealing. Go do this with your mom's stuff and see if she likes it.", "NTA and your mother is upset because you're imposing the boundaries that she should have. \n\nYou don't have a sister problem though, you have a mother problem, because she's making it clear that she feels your stuff is a common resource for everyone to just take. \n\nIf your sisters want to use just/go through people's valuables then start directing them to your mothers room, and then she can either enforce a boundary about taking people's things or completely ignore her hypocrisy and punish you for it. \n\nYour mother doesn't want to actively parent regarding this, but taking that view after having three children is a bit late, and it'll cause your sisters problems later when they live with other people who don't take kindly to their stuff getting taken.", "NO.....Now go buy a hair dryer and your own version of whatever appliances she wants to lock  away from you! Boundaries....it's all about the boundary!", "NTA, you should be able to have your things without them getting ruined, especially it's expensive stuff you bought. \n\nIt's pretty sad also that you have to keep things locked up because people can't keep their hands to themselves", "NTA move out asap", "NTA but your mother is.", "How would she like it if you went through her nightstand or drawers?  It's rude and hurting her daughter's relationship with you to just trample all over your boundaries. nta  I'm 13 years older than my sister... and she has always asked to use my stuff.", "NTA.\n\n\"Mom, I came to you and Dad with a problem.  In the absence of any response from either of you I came up with a solution on my own.  If you don't like that solution, perhaps you and Dad might be more responsive when I come to you with problems in the future?\"", "Hell no, NTA OP!

Sounds like your parents are teaching your siblings that it's okay to steal other people's stuff without consequences. Your mom in particular sounds vile and abusive, sorry you have to live with her... I can't believe she gets so agressive because you want to peotect your belongings and doesn't want to share.

The situation reminds me a lot of when I still lived at home.
