The difference is that they are kids and your mother is, embarrassingly, an adult.", "NTA. Odd your mom has a problem with you locking up your things, but not your sisters taking your things. Hopefully you're able to go off to college soon, and take everything important with you.", "NTA.

Your mom is abdicating her responsibility to tell your sibs that it's not OK to take other people's things without asking. Her comparing scent you bought yourself as a treat to home appliances is bizarre! She sounds like she's equating \"I want some privacy\" to \"I'm doing terrible things behind your back\" when really, most of us just enjoy and need some things to keep to ourselves, whether they're thoughts or items.

Buy yourself a hair dryer.", "NTA tell your mom sure if she wants to not be adult about this and talk to her children about boundaries and privacy, and the difference between personal stuff that is not household stuff then sure be petty and that you love how she is showing and teaching you to be even more childish and petty herself say thanks now I know I get to keep being petty just like you thanks for teaching me that.  On that note I think it is time for you to save up some money and get your own place and the sooner the better, and do it before they decide to kick you out.", "NTA I can understand young kids getting into your stuff, but your mom is being really weird about this.

It gets better as you get older and eventually move out", "Having secrets, or more generally having your own life is part of growing up.
