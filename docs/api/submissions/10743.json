From the post and the responses I've yet to see OP even say that her son wanted to attend this ceremony.", ">So because he cheated on his wife that automatically makes him a bad father? \n\nI think so, yes. Cheating affects the whole family.", "Y'all's family cheated on her and evicted her? \n\nDamn I hope she goes back to court and gets fuller custody, that's fucked", "So because he wants more you were willing to threaten to kick your grandchild out of his home? Once again your son's wants have superseded your grandson's need for stability, the exact same thing that went down when your son chose to cheat on his wife and break up this child's family.", "That\u2019s not really his (or your) decision to make. If he was such a great father then he wouldn\u2019t have left his poor kid in this messy situation. Cheating made him a bad husband, yes, but it also makes him a bad father. He willingly threw away full custody of his kid to get laid. \n\nGood luck seeing your grandchild again after you evict him and his mother\u2026", "If he actually wanted more time, he would go through the court system. Instead, you\u2019re punishing your grandchild.", "This... doesn't help you sound better. She can't leave the high cost of living area because of the custody agreement, so if she doesn't do what you want she's homeless and loses the kid. \n\nThat's effectively blackmail.", "Just keep showing everyone as much of an AH you are.   Though I'm sure everyone in your real world already knows.", "Gee, I can see where your son got his shitty morals from. Maybe you should consider where your son learned to manipulate and screw over the people around him (to include his own son) for his personal benefit. \n\nYTA for the manipulation and the rampant self-interest displayed in this comment alone.", "This comment, this one right here, is the comment that proves YTA. Keep throwing around how you get to hold your money over his mama's head OP, keep it up. You might read to him and watch YouTube with him and pay him off, I mean *pay for his school*, now, but when he's older, he'll see through you. He's going to grow up and see how you used your money to blackmail his mother. He's going to grow up and see what kind of person you really are. I hope you're prepared for the consequences when that happens. You are not a good person.", "Oh I think we are starting to see where your son got his awful personality from\n\nYTA you and your son sound disgustingly manipulative", "Nah, because they tried to reason with her before this and she wouldnt come to her senses.  She deserved the wake up call that her wellbeing depends on the good graces of others.", "I agree, but people are allowed to improve and become better. He has improved himself.\n\nI kicked him out of the home for his betrayal and failures as a husband and father. He is now a good man and good father.", "Nothing but children on here responding like continuously going to court is free and easy.", "\u201cOver the years DIL has made it difficult for my son to be active in his sons life\u201d reading must be a chore for you", "Wow YTA\nSo your son was a bad husband and probably not a good dad. The only reason he wanted 50/50 is so is child support goes way down. \nSo you have forced her and your grandson out of their routine. Now you seem to be gloating that she can't even leave if she wants to. You have successfully trapped, and used force on this poor woman.", "You\u2019re clearly slow. she was preventing the father of being apart of his life, and rarely does custody get split 50/50 if the mother is fighting for more. Do research on custodial courts before speaking. Also it isn\u2019t her house. She doesn\u2019t own it, nor does she pay the bills for it. How are you struggling to process what OP said so badly?", "It\u2019s so hilarious you \u201cholding her home over her head\u201d when the OP owns the home and the kids father, OP son pays utility", "He did. He was given 70/30 and 60/40 in the summer.", "GS calls me twice a day on his tablet to talk. We have a great relationship. I watch his YouTube videos with him and taught him to throw ball. \n\nI\u2019m paying for his college education so I don\u2019t think he will want me out of his life.", "I mean does OP need to give every single  instance of the DIL tried alienating the grandson from the father? No she doesn\u2019t but she did provide the one that broke the camels back. \n\nShe also mentions her son being much happier since the custody went 50/50 so yes he does seem to be happy to see his son more often. Or does your baseless Assumptions say otherwise?", "Honestly the son should call the school, this seems like an unreasonable rule that would affect many families.", "Lmfao what a fucking stupid argument.", "She wasn\u2019t evicted. Y\u2019all didn\u2019t cheat, the son did.", "She works 15 hours a week. I do not think she will be able to afford a lawyer, but my son would welcome the opportunity to be officially awarded 50/50.", "My GS will have stability at both homes.", "People are allowed to improve and become better, but the consequences of their past actions remain.\n\nOne consequence of your son\u2019s behaviour is that he is going to be excluded from aspects of his son\u2019s life, because he was a bad father.\n\nWhat are the consequences of your actions going to be?  Is your grandson going to exclude you from his wedding one day, because you blackmailed his mother?", "Did you read the same post I read?", "Nothing to do with CS. He pays the ordered amount and pays her utilities. I don\u2019t understand why you would think it has anything to do with CS.", "If you had read comments from the OP you'd know theyvhad valid reasons for giving less custody and he was given a fair deal, he should have gone back to court to adjust, she had no right to interfere.\n\nIt's her home, she lives there and staying there shouldn't be dependant on her making choices she doesn't agree with about her child.", "If he went through the legal routes, then there must be some reason why he\u2019s not been given equal custody. There feels like a lot more to this bad husband narrative that you\u2019re not telling us.\n\nAnd by the way, as a child of divorce myself, there\u2019s definitely a reason my dad wasn\u2019t given full or equal custody.", "So the courts only deemed him fit to parent that much, and you have forced more.", "Had he not cheated and lied to his family, he'd still have 100/100.", "Now that you extorted his mother into signing paperwork in order to continue being housed and allowing him to stay in his school. If she hadn't you were going to have this kid moving schools and houses because your son is incapable of being a grown up who addresses his own problems.", "GS wanted father to come with mother, so I think we will be fine. Personally, at his age and my age I don\u2019t expect to live to his wedding. \n\nI\u2019ll attend his college graduation though. Ill be paying for it after all.", "Agree with your take on consquences. Let's also talk about the consequences of the DIL's actions to try to limit the father's access to his kid, when she was living rent free in a great school district while earning low pay. Consequences for EVERYONE.", "Because the ordered amount drops when you physically have the child for more time... that is why", "Because that's why a lot of parents fight for that. They don't actually care about spending time with the kid just want to hurt their ex and save their money.", "Some folks love to jump to conclusions", "He was taking grad classes. He is now graduated but cannot adjust the custody through the courts for two years.", "The courts felt with his work and academics that it was best. He has since graduated but I unable to go to court again for roughly two years.", "You just acknowledged he would have stability in both homes which would be by both parents. Thank you.", "That\u2019s fine, you attend.  He may choose to skip it to spite you.  That\u2019s what my brother did when facing down a woman like you.  \n\nYou don\u2019t seem to care at all about the relationship you have with anyone, just your ability to control them.  Why is that?", "A district she\u2019s not allowed to leave due to court order, where the court order was set on the agreement that she live rent-free in that house.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s not entirely fair.   She needs to go back to court and get the order changed so that she can leave the area.\n\nThen - more consequences! - dad and OP won\u2019t be able to see the kid nearly so often *and* child support payments will go up.", "He already pays her utilities for his sons sake.. he\u2019s not going to stop doing that. He\u2019s offered to pay off he car so I just don\u2019t get it.", "Not sure what to tell ya then. Divorces are messy but your son could have prevented that by not being a terrible husband. Being a bully isn\u2019t going to\nhelp your son\u2019s case though, that much is certain. Best of luck.", "You have over stepped. What exactly does your son do that make him a good dad?", "OP the only thing you did wrong was to allow her to stay as long as you did. It sounds like the mother cannot support the child. Can your son get full custody?\n\n\\*edit to say, yes, that's pretty cold. It is a valid question though. Will she ever be able to support her portion of the child's needs??", "Wait what? While a court can force said person to stay in a general vicinity, a court CANNOT force you to have her live rent free. That's out of their purview.", "I have answers this elsewhere. \n\nHe does what good parents do. He listens, he gives lesson, he plays, he takes care of him, he spends all of the time he can with him. \n\nIs he a saint? Heavens no. He\u2019s a normal person doing his best. He messed up in the past and has worked to be better."]}
