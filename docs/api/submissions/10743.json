She only makes it off child support and the fact her rent is covered. I told my DIL I was done. I was going to serve her with an eviction notice.

Pretty nice guy. \n\nDIL wants to continue to punish son by denying access to your grandchild. She chose to use the kid as a tool to hurt him. (I understand WHY she wants to hurt him, but using the kid for this is wrong). \n\nYou decided she\u2019s gone too far and told her to either let the court decide visitation or the free housing ends. \n\nShe used her kid, you used your house.

She's an idiot who had forgotten the hand feeding her. If she wants the free rent and the huge house in the expensive area with the awesome schools, she should know she has to at least be politic as she walks the balancing act every divorcee walks when they must play nice with the ex they hate for the sake of their kid.\n\n*You* could have given her the boot, and then had your son file for full or majority custody on the basis that she'd be homeless and ruined her further with the lawyer bills for a court case to make that happen. But you settled for a very fair 50/50 split, drafted on the cheap.\n\n*She* apparently has family in the area, so she does have options. But she apparently loves living independently in the free house enough to not give it up and move back in with her dad. She's got options, but has *chosen* to be your pseudo trophy wife (as in, her main job for subsistance is keeping someone richer than her happy) which means her job is keeping you happy.\n\nIn the future, you should probably meddle less.

Ok gonna get down voted probably, shortish version is this:\n\nI have thought about this as my Stepdaughters (SD) mother has abused her position and done everything in her power to alienate my SD from her father going as far as telling her to never say I love you to him at 3 yo. Yes we tried legal and therapeutic measures. No it didn't work. Husband hs NEVER CHEATED or done any wrong her mother does not want the child to love anyone outside of the mothers family. \n\nThe maternal grandmother, who the mother and SD live with, DOES NOT APPROVE of this. She and I have shared many talks and I have seen the disgust in her face when SDs mother yells at my husband and threatens SD for caring about him. She will not, however do anything to help because, well that's her child and so she sides with her. I cannot fathom the situation she is in.\n\nNo she shouldn't put her daughter on the streets, but housing her daughter means that she is actively supporting the mom and dad not having a fair split and an equal playing field. I DO NOT BLAME ANYONE FOR BEING HORRIFIED THAT THEY ARE GIVING FINANCES TO A PARENT THAT IS ACTIVLY ALIENATING THE OTHER PARENT AND FREEING UP FUNDS FOR THEM TO FIGHT IN COURT. because it IS about money and time and stability. Not who is actually right or what is actually best.\n\nYes OPS son cheated. He tried for 50/50 custody. No we can't possibly know if she is painting a true picture of him. But on face value, every dollar exDIL has is another dollar to fight, housing her is allowing her to take advantage of stability that should be obtained through a fair split in parenting and both finding reasonable employment. OP is not responsible for subsidising the alienation for her son from his child. \n\nThe child will not go homless, the worst out come is that they live with their dad on his own dime. \n\nAgain, probably down voted, but I've asked myself so many times what I will do if one of my Own Children were to do this to someone. And honestly, saying be fair or I can't help is on the table. Of course I would add that the child always has a home there, but I cannot support alienation and abuse of my kindness.\n\nEdit: NTA.and if you have doubts about or want more info on my own experience I am able to provide.

I just mean that this is emotional and cannot be fully explained with out a fair amount of time, but I dont want lacking info to result in angry assumptions)", "YTA, if you even think for one second if something you're doing is morally right, it's probably not.

Unreal. \n\nDid you even ask your grandson his opinion?", "I'm just saying, if somebody is cheating it's because the relationship was in trouble so it's highly likely there would have been a divorce no matter what. \n\nSo saying \"well if he wanted to see his kids they shouldn't have split up\" is very unhelpful advice.", "So I'm a little confused by some of your responses. I thought you felt uncomfortable because you realize it's wrong to take advantage of someone else's lack of funds to get what you want, but I don't really get that feeling from you. If she had not agreed to your offer, from your other replies, you would have been perfectly comfortable using your money to pay for lawyers to handle things, when that was next possible. That's still taking advantage of DIL not being financially stable.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say, not as an attack (but definitely with judgement behind it because I'm only human) is your \"I did something morally questionable\" comment doesn't ring true for me. I don't think you're worried about that part. Which makes me wonder what you're worried about. I can think of a few things: \n\n1. You're not actually 100% sure your son and grandson are happier with this arrangement. Is there something you're not telling us? \n\n2. You're neglecting to talk about how much this has negatively impacted DIL, and you do feel guilt about that. \n\nFor 1, you sound pretty involved already, and the only thing you can do is keep your eyes open, and be honest about what you're seeing. Your other replies indicate you do really think your son is a good father, even if you're light on explaining what that is. (I imagine you just don't want to write an essay.) \n\nFor 2, well, yeah you have to live with that feeling. You did do a shitty thing. (I also judge your DIL some for not being financially independent, or walking away from your offer, but I don't know how much of that was caused by her expecting to have a very different life married to your son if he'd stayed faithful.) You can apologize or try to explain yourself, but you did a bad thing, even if it's for what you think were the right reasons. \n\nA final note: You say a bunch that you don't think your grandson will ever dislike you because you have money and are paying for things. This is a really bad lesson, especially for men to be learning. Yes, you can totally manipulate people with money. But please don't raise another generation of men who think that we should be bowing down to the person with the most money.  And also, there are people who are willing to walk away from money, and don't assume your grandson won't ever be one. (But again, you are very active in his life so as much as folks here want you to get some comeuppance, unless you have some other terrible views / behaviours you're not telling us about, it seems unlikely.)", "Things his dad should do.
