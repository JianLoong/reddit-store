Even more so for you, possibly, as it sounds like you came to the new country alone. I highly encourage you to speak to your girlfriend about this, perhaps consider cooking this food with her for her friends.

YWBTA because it is NOT your recipe to police, & that's got nothing to do with your personal feelings", "How do you think your girlfriend would feel if you ask her not to cook it? If i ask my boyfriend i think he would respect my feelings and not cook it (i wouldn't ask him though because I already explained).\nAlso I think that you're being very apprehensive with the dishes cause it somehow makes you feel close to your family and someone taking that dish from you feels like they're taking your family away from you, wich is not the case. Just think about every international little restaurant out there, most of them are owned by people who is away from their family but they take the best out of it and even make a living out if sharing their delicious cook. \nI'm not saying you should go an open a restaurant but i really think you're mixing feelings with this. \nAnd I'm sorry that you're away from your family i know how hard it can be.", "What you say doesn't make any sense.  Her cooking food from your country for her friends won't change how connected you are with your family.  The two things aren't connected.", "Is it YOUR food? Or are they meals from your home country like you said?", "I agree with the comment that u should not help her cook this time ... avoid the whole kitchen while she is in there so u can hopefully minimise your emotional involvement also.", "It's not about the food or the dish it's about the emotional toll it took on OP to share something that was very personal to them. It may not seem rational but that doesn't mean the feelings aren't valid", "When it\u2019s a culturally special dish?", "Lol!  Yes! I just came from that post. Ethnic foods are bomb, but find recipes online from people who are willing to share, don't steal a generational family recipe.", "Sorry.  I didn't think a Caramilk bar was unavailable in the U.S..  It's gotta be a +60 year old [advertising campaign in Canada](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=990842191342700)", "Yeah it that\u2019s what it is, to me it\u2019s more than food, to her is just a delicious dish. I know she means well, I\u2019m by no means implying she wrong for wanting to share. I have a lot of emotions attached to it", "I can\u2019t visit them, I fled my country cause it\u2019s a dictatorship, I wish it was that easy. But thanks", "Cultural appropriation is such an overused phrase which is, most of the time, misused.", "I can't think of a particular dish that's so sacred to any culture that it can only be prepared by people from that group. I live in Taiwan and I cook Chinese and Taiwanese food all the time. I'd go broke trying to eat a Western diet here.", "> When it\u2019s a culturally special dish?\n\nThat's not much of an elaboration. I'm not sure what \"culturally special dish\" means in this context. OP said that he taught her \"various dishes from my home country\". Can you tell me what the difference is between this and someone with an Italian boyfriend getting upset at his girlfriend for cooking lasagne for dinner? Or maybe it would be NAH if he did that too?", "eh, it might be, for all I know! No worries!", "We have one like that called Caramello", "Maybe it feels like cultural appropriation to you? Might be something to explore and talk about with your gf about. If my partner had that experience, I would respect it and not make it for a work event.", "Then you better hope for the best, get therapy & zoom for your family and not take it out on your girlfriend. She's appreciative of your culture and foods. She wants to share it. You don't get to tell her not to because you miss your family. One has NOTHING to do with the other.", "What psychopaths would downvote this? So sorry you cannot see your family due to the political climate. I bet they love and miss you.", "Can you tell me why you\u2019ve chosen to specifically question me when someone offered the same opinion? \n\nAre are you just an AH?", "Caramello is caramel-filled milk chocolate. Caramilk is a caramel-flavoured white chocolate.", "It\u2019s not though. OP needs therapy to process his trauma. Policing his girlfriend\u2019s cooking is not going to solve anything and makes him an ah.", "Jesus I\u2019m not taking it out on anybody I didn\u2019t even said anything to her, I got uncomfortable and I posted here because I\u2019m trying to see if somebody has had a similar experience and can help me identify what could be a way to solve it.", "> Are are you just an AH?\n\nIncivility because I'm politely asking your rationale? Really?", "And you got your answer. I'm not attacking you. I meant it when I said therapy. You're from a very specific circumstance. You've fled your home country due to a dictatorship. Your family is still there. You're homesick. That deserves a whole session worth of ranting. You said it yourself, it's not about the food. It's a deeper issue. Address it for your own well being. I also meant it when I said make it a priority to speak to your family more often if you can. You miss your family and you need that connection reinforced. And appreciate your girlfriend having any interest in your culture at all. Some people can be real oblivious or even nasty about that kind of thing. She likes cooking your foods with you. She wants to share that. So she should share that. Food bring people together. She's allowed to want that for her friends", "I understand your discomfort ... your feelings are valid ... like maybe those colleagues will critique her cooking & u will feel like they are judging your national dishes ?? \n\nI had a similar experience with playing songs on an instrument. My friend would ask me to play & sing my favourite songs till he knew them as well as i did. Then at a party when people were being invited to perform he jumped up & played & sung the songs he had learnt from me. \n\nLike wtf dude ?? I felt like he had taken something from me. Also they were my best tunes i could play without mistakes & knew the words. I didnt sing or play at that party & didnt like him as much after. \n\nTalking 2 him later did not help me feel better cos he said i was an idiot for feeling that way & he can sing any song he wants & i didnt even write them. True ofc. Except maybe the idiot bit, i still feel he was inconsiderate or even plain ole selfish. Sorry about your situation & NTA for having feelings.", "Info: what dieshes?", "Ugg, are you the proprietor of your countries cuisine? You sound tedious. YTA.", "YTA food is meant to be shared.  you didn't invest the food, its not yours", "YTA. I have a family member who does this. Not only is nobody allowed to cook Indian food because that's her thing, but she gets very unpleasant the second anyone bakes or cooks anything that gets compliments. Be proud you inspired her into culture sharing. That's how we all learn to love and understand each other in the long run.", "YTA, it would be one thing if this was food that was strictly meant only for specific situations but it is not. It's not a secret recipe or a sacred dish. Her learning and cooking these dishes is wonderful!", "YTA. That\u2019s what\u2019s known as gatekeeping. You dont own your county\u2019s cuisine.", "YTA, but a really minor YTA. I'd explore why you feel upset she liked your food enough that she wanted to share it with the other people around her! Maybe that's not how you're looking at it, but I assure you that's what happened.\n\nYou can't really own a cuisine, even if it's traditional to your culture. I've enriched my life, and that of those around me, time and time again by learning traditional recipes from people! Honestly opening myself up to different foods like that, and learning how to make what I like instead of eating out 100% of the time, has been one of the easiest improvements to myself I've ever made.", "YTA if you ask her not to cook food she enjoys just because you showed it to her first. I understand its personal to you..but does this mean you yourself dont cook food from other cultures? Because I'm sure to someone else..that's personal too. You should encourage her to share her love of your dishes, because imitation is the best form of flattery.\nI'm learning to make traditional jamaican dishes for my boyfriends mom for next years christmas..because I love it when she cooks for me and I'd like to return the favor with food she loves. I learned to make pastillijos as a little girl even though I am not latino in anyway..and i enjoy showing others how i was taught to make them. The sweet old lady who taught me grins when I send her a few and tells me I did good.\n\nDont gatekeep what should be shared freely. If you hadnt taught her these dishes she still could of learned to make them.", "YTA. \nin all honesty that\u2019s weird behavior. she enjoys your food, you should be happy about that. please reevaluate this before making her feel bad. she\u2019s not doing anything wrong. don\u2019t gatekeep food pls", "Yeah, soft YTA. I'd take it as a compliment that she loved your food so much that she wants to share your food and culture with her friends. That's really sweet. I understand you felt it was special to share it with her,  but she's impressed enough with you and your background to want to flaunt it. Take the compliment.", "The secret is that they roast the milk powder, which gives it the caramel flavour!", "I mean, that\u2019s just as rude or even worse. It\u2019s not like OP is the only person on the planet that can make the dish. Why shouldn\u2019t she be allowed to cook a dish herself?", "I\u2019m still saying the OP in the other post isn\u2019t TA but people like to gatekeep shit randomly", "You mean you can't survive off a diet of Four'n Twenty pies, fairy bread, and Bundy ginger beer? What kind of Aussie are you?", "Look I'm not saying I wouldn't give it a go just that I might not live as long as I'd like.", "Isn't that the AU/NZ/UK version while Canada one is milk chocolate filled with caramel like the Caramello?"]}
