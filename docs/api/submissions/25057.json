A future with kids and what if he doesn\u2019t make it back home than what. I asked him to at least consider it before jumping to conclusions. He straight up said that I am TA for even asking. I explained that I would marry him in a heartbeat but he can not stay in the military for ever if we are planning a future with kids etc. I am wondering AITA for asking him to stop doing what he loves?

You should have had this talk with him before accepting his proposal. I have a bad feeling the part about his family being well off and want him to take over in the future, might be influencing you too.", "Also...judging from your post, I wouldn't recommend dating anyone who's a cop or fireman either. I understand your anxiety...but this is what they signed up for.", "NTA. There's even more to it than wondering if he won't come home - he might well come home, but with PTSD and/or any number of other chronic conditions. \n\nI know someone who received a traumatic brain injury and has PTSD so severe that he has daily panic attacks where he curls up fetal on the floor because he can't stop being hyper-vigilant. An empty Big Gulp cup on the side of the road is an IED, every vehicle that pulls up beside them is a hostile about to open fire into his car. He needs verbal prompts to do anything, including use the bathroom. His wife has become his full-time caregiver, and will be for the rest of his life.\n\nThen there's the difficulty of his being relocated during the course of his service - you could lose your friends and, if you work, your job over and over and over each time he is stationed to a new base. My mother had to go through this and it has contributed to an old age of loneliness and sadness, because she doesn't really have any friends, having needed to leave all of them every time she made them.\n\nAny children you have, if that's your plan, would also have to endure the same, and as someone who went through it, I can tell you it's incredibly unpleasant to have to leave friends every few years. \n\nThe sense of rootlessness, of not really having a hometown since I moved 17x before graduating high school, was also upsetting. And the disruptions to my education were a huge hassle for my parents and I. I almost had to stay back a year because my former school's curriculum didn't match up with that of the new school.\n\nI don't say this to scare you off of him, but I think it's important to know what you're signing on for before you do, for both your sakes.", "NAH, though you should've had this conversation within year 1, because you kind of wasted both of your time.", "YTA\n\nYou should not have been with someone for 2 years if you didn't accept their career.

I can sympathize not empathize with your conundrum, I am not a military spouse. My husband was a lineman with an utility company. His work could be dangerous and if there was a natural disaster and service had to be restored, he could be called out of town on short notice and be gone until the job was done.

Im a military wife, and have been for 11 years. It\u2019s not easy, and I get that not everyone can handle this lifestyle, but you can\u2019t ask him to change to suit your ideal of the future.

It sucks that you let it go this long, but now is better to address this than after you\u2019re married.", "NAH. Well, actually, he's an asshole to say that you are an asshole for asking because if this is important to you, putting it on the table is critical. The thing is, if this is a deal breaker for you both, then you're both finding out now before the wedding. That's good timing. If he doesn't want to leave or at least have a timeline for leaving, then you can decide if you can handle it. It may be that you two are just incompatible.", "I'm not going to call you an AH because I wouldn't want my spouse to be in the military either... but this man wants to be in the military and always has!  It would have been much better for you to have let him know much earlier on that you weren't up for being a military spouse.\n\nI think the right thing to do is tell him you can't ask him to leave the military but you also can't marry him if he's in it and planning to stay in it and that both of you need to move on and find other partners.  NAH.", "YTA. you forcing a situation.   \nYou're expecting him to change for you. You knew what he was about when you started dating and said yes to marriage.

And you want him to throw all of that away because you can\u2019t cope? \n\nYTA and you don\u2019t deserve him.", "YTA, but I suspect you already know that.

He is a lifer, and that's his choice. You either accept it or not, that is your choice. Neither of you is wrong for the way you feel.

Especially since this guy has two degrees that would be very valuable outside deployment, even if he's still in the service.", "All of this.", "100% facts that\u2019s like her saying he\u2019s a doctor she knew when getting into a relationship that he\u2019s a doctor and works long hours but in order to marry her he has to quit being a doctor like wtf", "This sub, man. maybe 'they are very well off and they want my bf to take over' was intended to communicate that he has options, and will be just fine financially if he leaves the military. \n\nThis really feels like a conversation they should have had before he proposed? and definitely before she accepted, but she's allowed to say she doesn't want to marry him if he's staying in the military and he's allowed to drop her if that's not what he wants to do.", "Bingo! She\u2019s a gold digger.", "That\u2019s 100% what I was thinking", "As a military brat who deliberately chose not to go military op is absolutely an asshole because she knew going into the relationship that he wants to continue in the military and now she's giving him ultimatums", "He was in the military 5 years before they were together she knew what she was getting into. Shes TA for wanting him to leave so he can take over the \"well off\" business", "This is the only answer.", "\u201c9/11 and the Batman premiere.\u201d Are you seriously trying to pretend that being a civilian is even remotely as risky as being in the military?", ">and as an American, you should he grateful for the choice he made to defend our freedoms...I am!\n\nmost current wars are over money oil etc not freedom.", "No, I'm just making the point that anyone can die at any time. She picked him when he was already in, so she hasn't got the right to demand that he leave the military. My point is simply that it's just as easy to die as a civilian, especially in these times.", "How have you defended the freedom of the US", "They been together for 2 yrs now you mean to tell me for two years she didn\u2019t realized what it mean being with someone in the military ?", "She specifically says all he ever wanted was to be in the service. So clearly he\u2019s not a \u201cdo my four years and then I\u2019m out\u201d type", "They've had this conversation.  He told her he wants to serve his country in the US Military instead of work for his parents. This isn't new information for her. \n\nIf she did not want to marry someone in the military, she shouldn't have dated him for two years and then accepted his proposal knowing he wanted to stay in the military.\n\nThe addition of his parents being wealthy wasn't necessary. She already made it a point to say his parents had their own business and he has a college degree. People can infer from that that he had options. Including his parents' financial status was calculated.", "What the heck? It is very reasonable not to want to be a military spouse, especially if she thought it would be possible when they first started dating and only realized over time that it wasn't for her. \n\nShe shouldn't have said yes. She should have said \"I didn't realize we were at this point and we need to have a serious talk about what we're each envisioning for the future.\" Then said that she couldn't do the military spouse thing, and asked if he would be willing to discuss leaving the military. If he says no, then you just say okay, this really sucks but we both deserve to find someone who wants the same life. \n\nBut she's not a gold digger because she realized through dating someone in the military that she didn't want to be a military spouse.", "What the hell, how does that make her a gold digger? If you people had any reading comprehension, she's clearly saying that to show that him being in the military isn't about any financial reasons and that he would do just fine outside. It's why she also mentioned his two degrees which are highly useful in this job market", "She's also selfish, controlling, and abusive.", "This should have been established long before the engagement. She should have known already how important the military is to him and never gotten past the 6 month mark. But really she never should have started dating him in the first place. If this was a deal breaker for her, she should not have led him on all this time. YTA.", "I clearly stated I am a military veteran.", "She might have thought his career was taking one trajectory and it\u2019s taken one she\u2019s not comfortable with.", "Depends on when he started going on missions (also depends what those missions are). Most of the military in my neighborhood are on staff or teaching or education or intelligence rotations for about ... two years. During that time, they are basically working a normal job.  I can totally see someone getting close during such a rotation and not realizing how gutted they are when the person deploys.  But you work all that out before accepting a marriage proposal, not after.", "The words \"abuse\" and \"controlling\" have been watered down so much that they mean nothing. Absolutely nothing. This comment proves it.\n\nOP had 1 argument with her boyfriend.", "You have literally nothing to go off of to call her any of those things.", "Not everyone discusses future before engagement. Many go to military for benefits (medical, education), but don\u2019t stay long term.\n\nBy asking her to marry him, he said he wants a future with her. By saying yes, she said she feels the same about him. Now they are discussing the fine print.\n\nHe wants to stay in the military, for her that\u2019s a dealbreaker. Better to come clean now than after they got married. \n\nNTA", "You need to walk around the block a few more times. She got into a relationship with a man she never wanted and now he still isn't what she wants she's going to force him to be that way after he put time, feelings and his heart into it. This relationship will be something he will carry the pain of for the rest of his life when she knew from the start he wasn't what she wanted.", "Are you okay? You seem a bit disturbed."]}
