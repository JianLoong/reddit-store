A future with kids and what if he doesn\u2019t make it back home than what. I asked him to at least consider it before jumping to conclusions. He straight up said that I am TA for even asking. I explained that I would marry him in a heartbeat but he can not stay in the military for ever if we are planning a future with kids etc. I am wondering AITA for asking him to stop doing what he loves?

More to the point, you shouldn't have even started dating him or **CONTINUED** to date him after learning he loved being in the service. \n\n\n\n>My bf\u2019s family own their own company. **They are very well off** and ***they want my bf to take over***\n\n\nThis right here is the real reason you want him out.\n\n\n\nYTA", "You\u2019re a bit of an AH. You should have had this talk with him before accepting his proposal. I have a bad feeling the part about his family being well off and want him to take over in the future, might be influencing you too.", "Also...judging from your post, I wouldn't recommend dating anyone who's a cop or fireman either. I understand your anxiety...but this is what they signed up for.", "NTA. There's even more to it than wondering if he won't come home - he might well come home, but with PTSD and/or any number of other chronic conditions. \n\nI know someone who received a traumatic brain injury and has PTSD so severe that he has daily panic attacks where he curls up fetal on the floor because he can't stop being hyper-vigilant. An empty Big Gulp cup on the side of the road is an IED, every vehicle that pulls up beside them is a hostile about to open fire into his car. He needs verbal prompts to do anything, including use the bathroom. His wife has become his full-time caregiver, and will be for the rest of his life.\n\nThen there's the difficulty of his being relocated during the course of his service - you could lose your friends and, if you work, your job over and over and over each time he is stationed to a new base. My mother had to go through this and it has contributed to an old age of loneliness and sadness, because she doesn't really have any friends, having needed to leave all of them every time she made them.\n\nAny children you have, if that's your plan, would also have to endure the same, and as someone who went through it, I can tell you it's incredibly unpleasant to have to leave friends every few years. \n\nThe sense of rootlessness, of not really having a hometown since I moved 17x before graduating high school, was also upsetting. And the disruptions to my education were a huge hassle for my parents and I. I almost had to stay back a year because my former school's curriculum didn't match up with that of the new school.\n\nI don't say this to scare you off of him, but I think it's important to know what you're signing on for before you do, for both your sakes.", "NAH, though you should've had this conversation within year 1, because you kind of wasted both of your time.", "YTA\n\nYou should not have been with someone for 2 years if you didn't accept their career.

I can sympathize not empathize with your conundrum, I am not a military spouse. My husband was a lineman with an utility company. His work could be dangerous and if there was a natural disaster and service had to be restored, he could be called out of town on short notice and be gone until the job was done.

Im a military wife, and have been for 11 years. It\u2019s not easy, and I get that not everyone can handle this lifestyle, but you can\u2019t ask him to change to suit your ideal of the future.

It sucks that you let it go this long, but now is better to address this than after you\u2019re married.", "NAH. Well, actually, he's an asshole to say that you are an asshole for asking because if this is important to you, putting it on the table is critical. The thing is, if this is a deal breaker for you both, then you're both finding out now before the wedding. That's good timing. If he doesn't want to leave or at least have a timeline for leaving, then you can decide if you can handle it. It may be that you two are just incompatible.", "I'm not going to call you an AH because I wouldn't want my spouse to be in the military either... but this man wants to be in the military and always has!  It would have been much better for you to have let him know much earlier on that you weren't up for being a military spouse.\n\nI think the right thing to do is tell him you can't ask him to leave the military but you also can't marry him if he's in it and planning to stay in it and that both of you need to move on and find other partners.  NAH.", "YTA. you forcing a situation.   \nYou're expecting him to change for you. You knew what he was about when you started dating and said yes to marriage.

And you want him to throw all of that away because you can\u2019t cope? \n\nYTA and you don\u2019t deserve him.", "YTA, but I suspect you already know that.

He is a lifer, and that's his choice. You either accept it or not, that is your choice. Neither of you is wrong for the way you feel.

No question.  I didn\u2019t agree to date people in the military because I didn\u2019t want to be a military wife.  I knew that was not what I wanted for myself.

He was in the military for 5 years BEFORE you met him. If you didn't want to marry a man in the military then you shouldn't have dated him.

You are allowed to express your view of what being together looks like. And you are allowed to ask him if he is willing to leave the military to focus on family and let him know the anxiety and concern you go through while he\u2019s gone. But he also expressed to you his vision of what a future with you would look like. He wants a military career. He loves you and wants to be with you but also wants to follow his passion. If he said no to leaving, you either need to accept that and not marry him, or accept that and prepare to be a military spouse. No one is wrong here or an asshole.

I did 8 years and would have stayed if I could. Think about this... in 13 years he can retire and get a good pension with benefits. He can then do whatever else he wants and bring in even more money. Adjusting to life outside the military is not easy, so I don't think you have any clue what you are asking of him. Does he even want to take over the family business? Sounds like it is a no.

If his career mattered this much to you that you made an ultimatum between you and his job you shouldn't have said yes.\n\nI know what it's like missing and worrying for your partner whose in the military but you do realize he feels the exact same way about you and he still wants to commit his life to you and marry you regardless.\n\nEdit: I'm also a med-sep from the USMC so I've been on both sides of this.", "YTA.

From a practical standpoint as well, he has great job security and a better shot at long term income the longer he stays in. (I\u2019m pretty sure the standard is 20 years for a pension, unless there are extenuating circumstances. My partner was in for six and gets a medical/disability check from his branch every month.) \n\nI also feel like this was a bait and switch in a sense, because you had to know you wanted him out of the service before you said yes.

I can understand slightly why people would call you the AH because you did start dating a man in the military so you got yourself into this. You feelings are valid and you can state your wants and expectations but one of you will have to make a sacrafice.  He will either need to leave the military or you will need to become a military wife.

He is doing such an amazing thing for the country and you are forcing him to leave because of you. He can easily find another partner who respects people in the military. You can have your preference, but don't choose someone in the military if you don't want to deal with the consequences. I know that I would be willing to stay with my partner if he ever joined the military because I love him. Maybe if you don't love him as much, he's not for you. I feel like him being in the military isn't actually the main issue and you should sort that out.", "No, you\u2019re NTA, you have told him what you need, and what he needs may be the opposite.

This is absolutely the time to be thinking and talking about what your life together will look like. I am guessing you never planned on raising kids alone while your husband is on deployment. \n\nIt's OK that this isn't the life you wanted. Dating a military man is not at all the same as having a family with one. \n\nNow that he has said no, what are you going to do? Saying you can't live that life, then staying is going to cause bitterness and resentment in both of you. \n\nI don't think there is an AH here, I think the relationships has reached its end.", "YTA\n\nBeing a military spouse is difficult, and not everyone wants that life. You're right to discuss your willingness to go forward with a military person, but you shouldn't have said yes to the engagement and THEN asked if he'd leave the military. You should've had that conversation (and most likely ended the relationship) sooner.", "If this isn't the life you want, then don't marry him. Better to face that decision now than after you get married.", "NAH\n\nWhile I don't think there are any A H in this situation - you don't want him in the military (which he's been doing for 7 years) and he doesn't want to leave the military - this is not a compatible couple. Severely incompatible.\n\nHowever, if you struggle whenever he goes away then you really shouldn't marry anyone who takes any trips or drives at all. Driving fatalities are over 40,000 while military deaths are about 1500 annually. And if you need someone to text you or call you every day... there aren't a lot of men who will adhere to that at all. You sound needy and high maintenance. \n\nAlso, most of the military men are not 'somewhere fighting'. My dad had a 24-year career in the military... during several wars and police actions. Not once did he see a battlefield. You can ask your boyfriend his speciality and what he does on a regular, daily basis.\n\nYou seem very frightened of life and all the bad things that could happen. People die every day and there are no guarantees that your husband (whoever he may be) will every outlive you. Sadly there are no guarantees that your children will outlive you.

Each of you wants a different future.\n\nIn an ideal world, attraction and love is enough, but in the real world, values, habits, shared vision, lifestyle, money, etc. are as important if not more so for a successful partnership.\n\nYou two are not compatible as life partners.

Your asking him to give up his retirement plan. If you don't want to be a military spouse, then don't get involved with military personnel.

Probably already answered by someone else but he can\u2019t just \u201cquit\u201d the military. He has to at minimum wait until his contract is up. Then he can decide to get out or stay in. Usually if you stay in you get a nice bonus, a raise, other good opportunities, but you should definitely tell him your views on this and it\u2019s a factor he needs to take into account before re-upping.", "NTA\nThis is a conversation that needs to be had. You two have different visions for your life course and that's a problem. I'm not going to say that he should leave the military for you or that you should accept being a military wife, that's a decision for you two to make. You would regret it if you walked into a life you didn't want because you weren't willing to talk and it would kind of be a dick move to bail now without telling him why. In a perfect world you wouldn't need to have this discussion but life is life.

If he started this by saying \"I am a military man and will be in the military forever\" or something like that, or if he states it as a firm boundary at all, then it's for you to decide what your own expectations or boundaries are in relation to that or if *you* need to walk away.\n\nIf it would make him absolutely miserable to no longer be on active duty, or make you absolutely miserable if he kept going on missions and wasn't home, then however much you two love each other you aren't a good fit long term. If the issue is mainly kids, you may be able to compromise/find something you're both happy with, but DON'T just kick the can down the road to 'decide later' or something like that, otherwise you'll be in a much more committed relationship by the time you reach that point but quite possibly still have conflicting opinions on it/needs about it.\n\nLove is beautiful and wonderful, but the people we love aren't always right for us. Everyone has a path they're walking, and when we love them we want to walk side by side. It's not for anyone to tell them they can't stay on that path if they choose, but if your paths diverge you can't stay walking hand in hand anymore. One of you could choose a different path, or find a new one to walk together, but forcing someone to change because they love you isn't  a good solution. If this is your dealbreaker, and his, then it might be time to let go.\n\nGranted, it's also possible that he may change his mind in a couple years, or that you might. If he/you think that's possible/likely, it might be worth a long engagement to test things out and see how the chips fall. But don't make yourself unhappy or unwell for someone else, and don't make them unhappy or unwell for you either.

While they're deployed they can't have ready access to phones in a lot of areas so they can go over a month at a time with 0 contact. Meanwhile there will be news stories of incidents in those areas and you have to wait weeks to get confirmation that your partner is still alive.\n\nIt's all well and good to say, if you can't handle it you shouldn't date a military man. But the reality is, the man isn't a military man, he's a man, in the military. OP loves the man, who is a lot more than 'in the military'. He probably has quirks, humour, kindness, maybe an awesome personality and could be really smart and caring. So it's way easier said than done to just break things off.\n\nI was 8 months long distance with my fiance and that was crazy difficult but weve been married 8 years now. And our careers, pursuits and goals have changed and evolved over time.\n\nIf OPs partner would choose the military career over her, then that's ok he's allowed to make that choice, and OP is allowed to also make a choice.

But if you loved her yourself how could you want anything but to follow her lead on knowing what\u2019s best for herself?

Life is rarely fair but he's totally justified having his career staying the same as a deal breaker he can leave her. Also what if he's away for 3-4 months at a time happy in the army and his wife and kids absolutely hate it and are miserable and depressed at home?

It's not a totally absurd request though when starting a life and family with someone. There are other less lethal jobs or hobbies out there that can give a similar fulfilment. Kinda like when some guys get married and their wife asks them to trade their motorbike for a car, even if you love the bike most would just do it since it's more practical for a family and statistically much safer for the future. Sounds like his job is his life at the moment though, I guess it's possible he won't be able to build one he enjoys out's the army but he has all the building blocks to try. Whichever way you spin it, it's a career that requires you to roll the dice on your life much more often than other ones.
