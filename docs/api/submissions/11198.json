My mom gave it to me when she was sick (I was 7 at the time) and died soon after. She told me to be careful with it and that it was special to our family. A couple of years after she died I learned my dad had cheated on her with his wife and that my half sister was the product of the affair and born before my parents divorce was finalized. I was too young to realize when it was all going on. After learning this I had a hard time being around my dad. I remember my mom being sad and it made sense why. I also learned that he had told my mom in a really cruel way. How I found out is I eavesdropped on a fight between dad and my uncle and aunt (my mom's siblings) and heard it all, including how much my dad hated how \"boring\" my mom was. I remained distant from him, his wife and my half siblings ever since (I have two more half sisters and a half brother).\n\nMy dad decided to tell the oldest of my half siblings about the cookbook. He mentioned how much I valued it and all kinds of stuff. She wanted to share it with me, to cook from it, and to get to write in it like I will some day. She pestered me about it and every time I told her no. Then her parents would tell her more about it. In the end she was upset and sobbing over being told no. I had told her it was something special from my mom's side and I wanted to keep it private until I have children. That wasn't good enough because she insisted we're family and she's my sister.\n\nMy dad and his wife were angry with me. My dad's parents also told me I should have shared it with her and that I'm being cruel to her when my mom isn't alive to care if the child born from the affair gets part of the book or not, but she could be closer to me because I share it with her. I don't really care about my dad or his wife's opinion. I have no respect for them. They're pieces of shit in my eyes. But my grandparents and I always got along okay enough.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677679939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f4rzf/aita_for_refusing_to_share_my_familys_cookbook/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She may be biologically your half sister, but she was never your mother\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s very clear that your father didn\u2019t respect your mother in life and is continuing to disrespect her in her death. You are allowed to be protective of something that your deceased mother gave to you and is solely your possession. It\u2019s not your responsibility to explain to your half sister why the request is incredibly inappropriate - I\u2019m assuming she is already aware of the fact that your father cheated on his first wife with her mother and she was a product of that affair. It\u2019s absolutely not her fault that your father and step mother are awful, but it\u2019s crossing a boundary to assert that she wants to be involved in something that has been passed down through the female generations of your mother\u2019s family - a family that she is not a member of. I would get it if it came from your father\u2019s side, but you literally owe her nothing in this scenario. She, your father and the rest of your family are being incredibly inappropriate and gross by trying to pressure/guilt you into letting her have access to something that has never involved her in any shape, way, or form and absolutely doesn\u2019t hold any sentimental value to her.", "NTA.

I feel like your dad is trying to erase your mom by trying to get you to share this cookbook (a legacy from your mom\u2019s family) with your half-siblings. Essentially turning it from an heirloom from your mom\u2019s family to one of your dad\u2019s family. If his only concern was your bonding with your half-sister, there are lots of other ways that you could connect aside from this one, very personal thing.\n\nI would say that you are under no obligation to keep the recipes private, and if your grandparents are so concerned that you get closer to your half-sister, there are other ways than sharing something with this special connection to your mother.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI really expected a different story.

Passing this cookbook to your children will be a healing process for you, and you should not be pressured to surrender it.\n\nYour grandparents have a completely different pov, as they presumably love you and your half-sibling equally.  I doubt they see that sharing this will cause you pain, or if they do, they don't think you \"should\" feel as you do.", "NTA - it is from your maternal side, so there\u2019s no real reason to share it and let someone else copy it and write in it. That being said, if you want to have a decent relationship with your half sister, you could offer to cook something out of it with her. You wouldn\u2019t be giving her the book, but \u201csharing\u201d in a way by using it together. \n\nlast point, if I were you COPY IT.

How old is everyone in this story?? Why is your half sister crying about recipes from people she never knew?", "NTA. But the real AH is your dad, not your half sister. You should not allow her to touch the physical book, but in your position I would consider giving her a pdf scan of it, that she can print out, bind and annotate herself.

I would be glad to have another person help keep positive memories of my mother alive.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't imagine what it'd be like to lose a parent at such a young age, that's rough.  You've got legitimate grievances towards your dad, no doubt, but IMO you'd be TA if you kept stonewalling your half sister who is completely blameless in all of this.  She's part of your family too, even if you don't share a mother.  What do you think your mother would tell you to do? Unless your mother was a vindictive sort I would venture a guess that she'd want you to be more kind and less petty.  It'd cost you nothing and sounds like it would mean a lot to someone else.", "NTA - is she sharing any family heirlooms with you? Probably not. Your Dad is TA, though by being  disrespectful to your mum. \n\nIf you have the book at home I would move it to your aunts house so it isn't ruined", "NTA. I would never have thought I\u2019d vote n.ta about someone not wanting share recipes, but here I am.

WTF are they thinking?", "They have absolutely nothing to do with that cookbook at all. The audacity to demand anything in regards to your mother after how your father spoke about and treated your mother is outrageous. Keep that book safe and far away from all of them. Of course your grandparents are going to take his crappy side, he\u2019s their nasty piece of work kid. Don\u2019t discuss it with any of them anymore. None of them are entitled to anything from your mother\u2019s side. NTA", "NTA - It's maternal cookbook. It's shared on the Maternal side. Your paternal side cheated, had a kid and created his own secondary side. She has her own maternal side that she can start traditions with without taking anything near and dear from you.", "NTA.

That book was created by and is for members of your mothers family.", "NTA.\n\nA tradition passed down your mothers side has nothing to do with your fathers love child. She has no claim to it. I suggest finding somewhere very safe to hide it and keep it locked up.", "NTA. It's extremely cruel of them to casually say that your mom's not around anymore to care about the book, so you should just let anyone have it. I'm sorry but your grandparents are wrong. It's something special that your mom gave to you. Keep it and give it to your own child, assuming you have children obviously.", "NTA. She's not your mother's, grandmother's, or great-great-grandmother's family. And that's the matrilineal line that's important here. She didn't know them, they didn't know her. So they never cooked the family recipes for her, and never intended her to learn them. That's yours, and you don't have to share.\n\nThat said, your half-sister is being manipulated by her parents. That's cruel to both of you, as they know what this book means to you and want to take that away from you. They know that by keeping it private, they're forcing you to hurt their daughter. Which means that they are 100% responsible for the whole mess.\n\nI would highly advise that you ask your mom's siblings to hold onto the cookbook and any other treasures from your mom for you until you are able to move out. We read far too many instances of these items being destroyed by jealous step and half sibs on this sub, and your parents are absolutely creating a situation where this could happen to you.

This has nothing to do with your half sister.", "There are conflicting responses so this is not a clear cut case.\n\nThis is from your maternal side - your grandmother and your mother?
