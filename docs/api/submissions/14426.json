During the pregnancy, my wife and I were talking and I mentioned a few times about putting a tracker on our daughter when she was born. She mentioned this to her mother. Her mother was mad and completely against it. Me and my mill argued about this and I dropped it. \n\nLater on, I told my wife that I was putting it on her baby carrier she just said okay a few days later I went out to buy an AirTag and put it on the carrier I told my wife that I put it on there and it was set up. It\u2019s been 5 months and thankfully I\u2019ve never needed it. Today my sister has her overnight and my iPhone notified me saying that my daughter's tracker no longer was near me (meaning my sister left to go home with her) I told my wife that they left and just gotten on the highway. \n\nShe ask me how I knew she was on the highway I told her the AirTag told me. she now claims I never told her and don\u2019t remember me telling her that I put it there I finally convinced her that we had this conversation multiple times and that I told her. she now insists we tell her family. I know even if my wife convinces her mother to just allow it she will just use her baby carrier and a completely different set of baby stuff. I do not want anybody to know now my wife is giving me short answers when I talk to her \n\n\nAITAH\n\nEdit To clarify a few things  my wife has memory issues so there are times where we have full-blown conversations and she doesn\u2019t remember having them especially during the pregnancy and afterwards no matter what it\u2019s about \n\nSecond I have no interest in tracking my wife we have Life360 where we can see both each other\u2019s location at all times so there\u2019s no need for a tracker if I really wanted one and My Wife insisted on the Life360", "created_utc": 1681100280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h6tdq/aitah_for_putting_a_tracker_on_my_daughter_baby/", "score": 829, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I cannot imagine how anyone would object to using an airtag to track baby. If they had been available when mine were babies, I would have had them embedded in every shoe, stuffed animal, and backpack they used.", "NTA. Good call getting the AirTag, this is suspicious behavior from your wife and mother.", "NTA. Suuuuuper unclear why your MIL has a say in the matter?", "NTA \n\nI would tell folks though because if an unknown(not linked to your account) AirTag is following you and you have an Apple product, it will tell the person with it anyway about it. I was/am nanny, and when I had a nanny family where I took the kids places I always shared my location with the Mom through my phone. An AirTag isn\u2019t a big deal, but yes I think you should tell them as an expectation of them caring for your child.", "if you\u2019re with a *child*, particularly someone else\u2019s, you shouldn\u2019t be going to questionable places. it\u2019s not wrong to protect your child.

I understand not wanting them to know in order to avoid them using different baby items but could it not just be an understanding that this is to protect your child in case someone attempts to kidnap them. I would think your MIL would understand just wanting to be able to protect your baby in that horrible situation which of course I hope would never happen!", "NTA - you have every right to do what you think is appropriate to protect your kid; however, aren\u2019t you being a little too paranoid, what are the odds someone is going to kidnap your kid?", "Why did you feel the need for a baby carrier?\n\nI\u2019m curious. Is it a general thing or is it specific to someone(s). Because there seems to be animosity between you and your In Laws, and your MIL reacted rather surprisingly.\n\nRegardless it\u2019s not their baby so NTA for now, but I am Curious", "NTA. It's your child and you can keep her safe by whatever means you deem necessary.", "INFO Why does this grandmother need to allow this?", "YTA. This is an invasion of privacy, and very similar to how it must be disclosed when you are being recorded. I know you think \u201cmy baby, I should be allowed to track them if I would like.\u201d But that does not give you a transitive permission to track other people without *their* permission.", "YTA.  And in some states, may be guilty of cyberstalking.", "Seems smart. Maybe your wife has something to hide.\n\nNTA", "Yta, this sounds like you gaslit your wife into believing about a conversation that never happened. Because if you are tracking the carrier you are tracking her too, and I highly doubt she would have agreed to it without a big fight as that's a huge red flag of mistrust on your relationship.", "NTA. Your baby, your rules. Whatever helps you feel safe. With the world the way it is today, I don't blame you for wanting a tracker. All it takes is a split second for something unthinkable to happen, and you would be one step ahead in trying to find your daughter. Her mother should respect your wishes. I don't see the harm in you not telling them as you are probably right the moment they find out they will just purchase new items, and while in their care, they will use them.", "Definitely NTA! Why, why, why would anyone in the family have a problem with you tracking your infant?!?! That's smart in this day and age! And it's no one else's business but yours and your wife's. Not the MILs! What? Is she taking the baby to the bar or something?! Jeez. On top of that, she's YOUR daughter, you choose what you want for her, NOT your MIL!", "I don't think anyone should know. There's a saying where I come from that says \"you never know\" and it means you never know who you can truly trust. You never know what goes through someone's mind, and even is someone on the family doesn't do anything she's YOUR daughter and this is not about the family.  You can also never know what a stranger can do. An example is how most children are abused by family members the parents trust, maybe they won't do that but well, you trust this people enough to let them take your daughter but let's say they take her to the mall and suddenly the carrier dissappears with her. Then you can find her. I think if the family know they will take it out or like you said use something else. If they see it you can just say \"Oh Yeah, I put it there a long time ago just in case\" and that's it. You don't owe them any explanation. Maybe you can say that to your wife or I don't know show her this comment. Again, I'm not saying the family will do anything but you really NEVER know. Comming from a person that experiences a lot by people my parent's trust and watches to many crime documentaries to know it's someone close most of the time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why do they think this way?", "It\u2019s very rare that when someone kidnaps a baby especially an infant and they don\u2019t take a car seat if they get pulled over it will look suspicious plus the fact that most babies will just let anyone take them in the carrier when they\u2019re being actually cared by a stranger they don\u2019t know most will fuss and not corporate. So it very height chance they will take the car seat", "Most care seats go right into a stroller. If a child is kidnapped, they'll most likely be in their carrier.

He doesn\u2019t need to know that they went grocery shopping (to use his example) but has obviously checked.", "I know, but with the animosity with the MIL, I suspected there might have been history or behaviour or more reasons behind wanting the tag. \n\nLike family members that when babysitting just decide on taking the baby to see more family or something without permission. \n\nAll of which would only make me agree more that he needs the air tag", "The rate of child abductions by strangers has always been an extremely small fraction of abductions, and it has been declining since at least the mid-90s.  Not that you shouldn\u2019t use a tracker for your peace of mind, but it\u2019s not true that kidnappings are more common; they\u2019re not.  There is more high-profile coverage of kidnapping, not an actual increase in incidents.", "Fair enough then. Still very much NTA. The reason ultimately wouldn\u2019t change that. \n\n(Little benefit with phones, at least with iPhones is that you can share location with contacts and people don\u2019t often think of this. \n\nCould try and give her a phone, share location info with your and your wife\u2019s contacts. Something like that. \n\nAlso stuff like AirPods or watches can be tracked with MyDevices, even if it\u2019s the AirPods out of the case, which can be easily hidden.

If he has so little trust in his own wife and her mother that he needs to track them doing some shopping he has serious issues. I fully understand why they think it\u2019s a bit weird. I also understand OP\u2019s thought process about kidnapping etc. but the likelihood of it happening is so low it\u2019s borderline paranoia. Especially if he thinks a kidnapper wouldn\u2019t check for an airtag or similar and just dump it somewhere. \n\nIf one of kids goes somewhere with a family member I don\u2019t need to know every move they make, and if my husband put a tracker on any/all of them when they were out with my mum I would think he had lost the plot.  If he tracked them when they\u2019re with me I would be furious. I\u2019m a grown woman and can take our kids wherever I please, the same applies to him.", "Then even more fair and even more NTA. This is your baby\u2019s safety which is completely justified. And if your wife wants to tell your in laws let them know about this.", "The issue is that your mother-in-law is very much against the tracker for unknown reasons like at first, I was suspicious, so I did look at it when she had her the mother-in-law and she wasn\u2019t doing anything suspicious she only stayed home and went to the grocery store so I have no clue why she is so against it", "I was suspicious too. Really just get your wife to understand why, make a United front, and if you choose to tell the IL then tell them directly this isn\u2019t up for discussion.", "Um, you seem awfully paranoid. I just had a baby too, and the thought of putting a tracker on her or near her never crossed my mind. Yta", "NTA. Why is there a problem with this? It's on the car seat  not implanted in the baby. Yes, it sounds a bit OTT  but there have been cases where people have left a child momentarily in their car seat when unloading shopping etc, and theives have jumped in and taken car and kid! It's not like he's secretly planted tags in all his wife's handbags, shoes etc.", "NAH. It's a bit suspicious that your wife agreed but then claims to have no memory of it. However, while babysitting a friend's kid (7) I took them to a local event and the kid wandered off. Called my friend in a panic and she goes \"no problem, I'll send you a screenshot\". Kid is a wanderer, she clips an airtag onto his belt loops before going to crowded areas. You don't need it until you need it.\n\nThere are all sorts of privacy concerns here. I get wanting to track your child, but you are also tracking the adult the child is with. You really need to have a clear conversation and set out rules for the use of the tag. Because if I was your sister I'd be creeped out that you were using your baby to track me.", "ESH. I have a feeling you told your wife when she was busy doing baby things or doing other tasks. Given the arguments last time I think it warranted more than a 2 second heads up. I'd suggest an air tag for your stuff and buy them air tags for optionally putting it on their stuff. Unless you have reason to believe they're taking her places they shouldn't, you shouldn't be making this call. If you don't trust them to mind your child then they shouldn't be minding them.", "NAH \n\nWife and her family r allowed to be mad bcs you are indirectly/accidently stalking them without their permission.\n\nTell em to get an baby carrier and tracker of their own.", "Sometimes reading this sub, I genuinely don't know how humans made it to 2023.", ">I cannot imagine how anyone would object to using an airtag to track baby.\n\nThe tracking information can be intercepted and used to track not only your baby, but also members of your family, and to find out locations they frequent(like, homes, for example). Do you like the thought of a stranger knowing exactly where your child is, every minute of the day? Besides, tracking people(not the baby, the adults babysitting it) without their knowledge is pretty shady.", "No it's not. A lot of people quite rightly recognise the huge privacy concerns of things like airtags and the ways they can be abused and aren't comfortable with them in any setting. \n\nAs someone who also dislikes a lot of this tracking technology and is very uncomfortable with the lack of regulation and weak privacy laws in many countries including the US around these technologies, I very much can see both sides of this argument. \n\nI also think anyone being tracked by the technology has the right to know they're being tracked. If the family aren't comfortable with it, then there needs to be a conversation about whether tracking is the red line. The deal should be tracking with consent. If the family don't want to be tracked then OP needs to find alternative childcare if they can't give up the tracking.", "What about accidents? Had a case here in the U.K. recently where 4 teens drove off the road and the police didn\u2019t take their parents concern when they didn\u2019t come home seriously.\n\nAll 4 were trapped in the car for **3 days**, two of them dead already. \n\nOr what if your car gets stolen and the baby is just collateral damage? \n\nBetter to have and not need than sit there grief stricken at not having done more. \n\nMIL needs to butt out!! This is the parents decision and if wifey can\u2019t come up with a good reason why not to do this, then sorrynotsorry it needs to happen, because no one is *that* psychic.", "Totally agree. If we haven't wiped ourselves out in the next two hundred years it will be a bloody miracle.", "Genuine question. Reserving judgement for now.\n\nJust out of curiosity, why do you feel the need to track your newborn. Eg. Do you live in an area where infant abduction is an issue.\n\nAlso, when do you plan on removing the tracker? What age?.", "They used it right tho. \ud83d\uddff?", "No, because there is legitimate reason to do this, especially now that MIL is insisting on not having it on. Where is she planning on taking the baby that she doesn\u2019t want OP to know about? Because that tracking info theory is ridiculous. That\u2019s like never letting your kids outside because that\u2019s where the bad people are.\n\nSounds to me like wife is enmeshed with her mother and is just going along with what mommy wants. That\u2019s not a valid reason to change her mind on something she previously agreed with her husband.", "This is deeply creepy. It\u2019s a proxy for tracking your wife. Not voting, but wow - this is creepy.", "NTA given that you told your wife but I actually think this increases the safety risk to you baby because AirTags were not designed for that type of security and are on a semi breakable cloud system. I personally would find it much less safe and I think it\u2019s a valid privacy concern on the family\u2019s part. Just take that into consideration.", "I personally don't understand why a child under two maybe I'll even be fair under one is ever going to anyone else's house for a sleepover or anything unless your child's going while you're working I don't know maybe I'm delusional or maybe it's just in my world where my children never went anywhere until they were two without me especially not until I was done nursing them which was after they were a year old.", "NTA\n\nGrandmother does not make decisions on your baby. It\u2019s up to you and wife and as she didn\u2019t have a problem with it before her mother interfered I would listen to another commenter and work with your wife on not being enmeshed with her secondary family. \n\nAlso. Do you have any concerns about your wife\u2019s family? Have their actions / words been questionable in the past? I know you read the warning that AirTags and other such trackers are not meant for people / prevention of bad things but I wonder if this is a case of new dad anxiety over new baby or my in-laws have said / done things not great in the past and I don\u2019t fully trust them. \n\nWhatever the case is keep the air tag, let them know it\u2019s there and if they don\u2019t want to be tracked they can come to your home to see baby.", "NTA \n\nAs a parent, you need to know where your kid is at all times.", "Why would you need to convince the babys grandmother this is a good idea? This is your baby, grandmother doesn't get a say, especially when it's for safety reasons. NAH", "Going against the grain and saying YTA, not for putting the tracker on but for insisting your wife keep secrets from her family for no good reason. The only reason to keep the tracker secret is because you don't trust that the person wouldn't disable it for the express purpose of doing something nefarious with your kid.\n\nNot to go all Pepperidge farms, but when I was a kid we didn't have cell phones let alone trackers, so people would be out of touch and unreachable for literal hours at a time. Sometimes an entire afternoon, even. As such, back then if you didn't trust someone to be alone with your baby, you just... didn't leave them alone with your baby. Seems like you have exactly the same option now.\n\nPlus, air tags will tell any iPhone that's close by that there's an air tag following them. So your inlaws may well find out whether you tell them or not. And I'm guessing if they find out that way, it is going to cause your wife a lot of grief from her family because it is a clear indication that you will do sneaky things to invade their privacy because you don't trust them.\n\nStop trying to force your wife into entirely unnecessary fights with her family. If you don't trust them, buck up and say so. If you do trust them, it shouldnt be a big deal to tell them it's there and have a conversation about their comfort with it. Being sneaky is not a good look.", "Ok this is from a different perspective but having dealt with work hacks and having family in software engineering I would never in a million years put an AirTag on a baby or anything else that\u2019s not an entirely closed system and doesn\u2019t link to the cloud.", "Agreed. I also have a feeling that if it was the wife posting this, then there would be more of a positive reaction from people. No one would question her wanting to know where her 5 month old baby is.", "I'm honestly torn on the idea of it bc yes it's a risk but also it's super helpful. A lot of my friends have airtags on their keys, skateboard, bookbag, and stuff", "[deleted]", "YTA if you do this.\n\nYour MIL has a right to privacy and to make her own decisions about privacy.

It's about a kid and there whereabouts...", "Genuinely asking what concerns?\n\nAlso, MIL and her family should only see baby at OP\u2019s home if they disagree then.

I would just be more hesitant to put one on a baby\u2019s things personally", "I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s about preventing abduction because baby can be abducted by anyone at anytime. I think it\u2019s just the a way to reassure himself about the whereabouts of baby. \n\nI will say that since MIL is so vehemently against the tracker on the carrier then MIL only get to see baby in OP\u2019s house.", "If the mil is with the kid, it is exactly the case. He is tracking her whereabouts as well, without her consent (because she is with the kid). I'm not saying OP is the AH, because I understand his concerns about safety of his child. However, by not saying anything, he is tracking his mil without her consent when she is watching his child so I can also see how his wife might be upset about it.\n\nDunno what the right course of action is in here and I wouldn't want to make that decision. I'm just saying it because I think it is important to see both sides when making a decision.", "Well, it's about the whereabouts of the baby carrier, as soon as the baby is removed from the carrier the airtag is just an expensive accessory...\n\nI don't think this is problematic as such, just that OP is pretty dumb if they think they are actually doing anything to prevent an abduction or anything like that.", "If we assume OP is lying it would be the right use.", "> Sounds to me like wife is enmeshed with her mother and is just going along with what mommy wants. That\u2019s not a valid reason to change her mind on something she previously agreed with her husband.\n\nUmm...yeah. That is certainly one possibility.

That is their right, but OP thinks it's just fine to track them secretly.", "Cause the wife is a pushover and is already crumbling over the reaction her mother will have when discovering this.", "Yes, I do think he has the right to know where MIL is taking his child.", "Because some people who you think are honest and trustworthy might turn out not to be", "I wouldn\u2019t. But I\u2019m not the OP.", "If OP's MIL is like that, why is he letting her take the kid anywhere at all?  They should be NC.", "The tracker is on the carrier.  The adult is not being tracked, the baby is.  That is completely reasonable and no, the father has no obligation to tell people that the BABY CARRIER is being tracked.  If he put a tracker on their car or on their person, he would be wrong, but this is completely appropriate.", "If you have a cellphone you are already being tracked, just not by someone you are close to. \n\nPeople trust family members to babysit but then find out too late that it was a bad move. Truly evil people are great at hiding it, thats why there is so much sexual abuse and kidnapping happening within families, because it was never for one moment what they expected of that person. That's why as parents we need to prepare in order to prevent the worst from happening. An air tag is a great way of accomplishing that.", "I think that it at least covers one case of a baby being snatched. That\u2019s why some parents put AirTags in the kids\u2019 shoes/on their clothes, or on all carriers/strollers etc.", "What if the car is stolen while the baby is in the car? I\u2019ve seen a few news stories about that.", "As a parent, I trust my nannies. I also have nanny cams. Because unfortunately even the people you trust can sometimes break that trust. I hope it never happens, but you\u2019d be incredibly naive to think that it could never happen to you. I think he could have informed her, but I think her reaction to a tracker on the baby\u2019s carrier says a lot about the kind of person she is. I personally would limit her contact to supervised visits and have a very serious sit down with my partner about my distrust. But when it comes to my children and their safety, I don\u2019t compromise.", "This is a disgusting comparison.", "so is a nanny cam also creepy and invasive?", "Then why would you charge them with the care of your infant child? Like be serious.", "If I thought my MIL was going to take my baby somewhere that would endanger her, I just wouldn't allow her to babysit.", "No. If you let someone borrow something that has a tracker in it, then the person doing the borrowing should know about the tracker.", "In what kind of distopia do you live that baby snatching is that common?", "Ah yes babys get kidnapped constantly.\n\nLeaving a baby in a car is not done. Leaving your car running while out of it is not done.\n\nSome things are common sense. In what distopia do you live that people are constantly snatching babies?", "And the nanny knows about the nanny cams right?\n\nThat's the entire issue.", "So is tracking an adult without their consent", "Yes!", "If it\u2019s not made known to people working in the space? Yes, creepy.", "Have you ever had a friend you thought was trustworthy to find out later that they were not?", "If this was a couch, I would agree.  You are saying that the father should not track the baby.  There is a reason that people buy nanny-cams.  Same reasoning here.", "\ud83d\ude02 it\u2019s not, but parents are allowed to be worried and cautious over their infants who cannot look after themselves. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with parents being overly careful with their infants.", "Nope, she knows about the nest cams but not the hidden cameras. And it\u2019s legal where I live.", "Nope, perfectly legal. I can even record conversations without your consent and use them in a court of law. Your lack of awareness about the law doesn\u2019t make ME disgusting. Child abusers are disgusting, me making sure my child is safe is not. Relax.", "I've never said he shouldn't track the baby. I said he shouldn't do it secretly.\n\nJust like nanny cams it would be unethical for the nanny to not be made aware of the nanny cam.", "You are a disgusting person. She should be made aware.", "Sure it\u2019s legal, a lot of disgusting shit is illegal", "Yea, tracking adults without consent is called stalking in my country.  I am confident it is not legal here, and I am confident it is not moral.", "\u201c Later on, I told my wife that I was putting it on her baby carrier she just said okay a few days later I went out to buy an AirTag and put it on the carrier I told my wife that I put it on there and it was set up.\u201d\n\nAnd MIL does not need to be told. Have you heard of nanny cams?", "So why do her feelings matter more than his? This guy is trying to be a good, protective father and everyone is acting like he is some sinister stalker up to no good \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nThe reason no is not a full sentence in this instance is because it is their baby, not just hers and neither of them get to unilaterally make decisions related to baby\u2019s safety. To come to a compromise they need to talk. They can\u2019t do that if his wife acts like an ass and says no with no further effort to communicate and sort this out. Good for you if you like living in a Dictatorship, but I like 2 way dialogue on matters that concern me - and his kid is very much his concern."]}
