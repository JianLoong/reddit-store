{"id": 21919, "submission_id": "14wares", "title": "AITA for saying I don\u2019t like pasta", "selftext": "After a house party, my friend (28M) and I (28M) were in the kitchen looking for late night drunk snack. I was talking to my friend about an upcoming Europe trip I'm going on with a friend. He makes a comment about how good the pasta is there. I tell him I'm not the biggest fan of pasta and am more interested in seeing the culture and architecture of European cities. He has a huge reaction as he is a quarter Italian and that's one of his favorite cuisines. \n\nI tell him I personally don't like it as I grew up eating Korean food everyday. Korean food has a lot of spices with a bunch of varied flavors and that is what I prefer. I know this is a controversial opinion but I can't really change my taste buds lol.\n\nHe was unable to accept that answer and brings in his girlfriend into the conversation, who is half Italian. She jumps on his side and now they are both kind of interrogating me about it. I explain my reasoning but doesn\u2019t get through to the two of them. I tried to clarify I wasn't judging against and criticizing Italian cuisine. It's simply my personal taste. I was getting annoyed having to explain myself over and over again and the argument eventually escalated.\n\nAt this point, I said lets just move on from the conversation. For some context, my dad has really bad anger issues so I hate conflict. My friend refuses and keeps on bringing it back up. He goes onto say I'm being ignorant and I haven't tried authentic dishes yet. I disagreed. I've lived in LA + San Diego for 2.5 years and also had a roommates that moved from Italy. He would show me around to authentic Italian restaurants with varied prices in both cities. My roommate said the food was similar to food back home. I feel as though I can trust his opinion as he grew up in Italy. \nAt this point I tried to remove myself from the situation. Wanted to get an Uber home but was unable to find one so early in the morning. Eventually just left the kitchen and went to bed.\n\nHaving a difficult time trying to move on from the argument. I went to the gym and a walk for some distractions but it keeps on popping back up. This kind of starts a negative feedback loop and it\u2019s been affecting my daily responsibilities and mental health. It makes me sad because I've been friends with him for 20+ years. I practically grew up with him and the fact that he was unable to understand that not every culture is the same and everyone grows up differently irked me. I don't know if I can continue being such close friends with him. Diversity in preferences and culture is what makes the world and people interesting. I think it's important to respect that.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Probably get removed but for some more context he\u2019s a strong supporter of certain orange. Past arguments were about issues more serious than pasta lol. Zero chance I would end 20+ year friendship over some noodles.

You did not say you hated his personal recipe, you did not attack his character OR his favorite food, and stating an opinion in such simple terms is part of conversation. This is unhinged.", "NTA. Repeat your last two sentences to him if he tries to start a fight over it again. Your taste buds are not a personal affront to him.", "OP, this really isn't about culture.\n\nIt's about his getting angry that you don't agree with him on something. It's a bad personality trait, but I've seen others with it.\n\nYou have a right to eat what you want without his getting up on you. It was a ridiculous topic to get heated about, but he would not leave it alone. This is a personality issue, because his is problematic, and I wonder how you were able to be friends for twenty years without this happening before.\n\nNTA. He is.", "So, I'm 1/4 Italian and don't like most pasta sauces unless there's meat or sugar has been added, because I don't like tomatoes. No one in my family INCLUDING my 100% Italian grandfather ever cared. Your friend was way out of line, and then to bring in someone else? NTA, and if he ever starts up the argument again, walk away if you can.", "NTA, everyone has personal tastes. You clearly have respect for the culture and the people. I feel like it's a bit unjustified that your friends feel like pasta is the be-all and end all of the Italian culture.\nIt's clear that you have tried different types of pasta and made an informed decision that you don't really like it.\nI'm going to assume your friend also knew about your feelings towards arguments and conflicts - they should not have put that situation on you.\nThis makes me very annoyed for you, as you are all adults and should be capable of letting go of simple things like personal tastes, likes, and dislikes. \nIt's like where I'm from, Australia, we have a thing for Vegemite, but we don't shame people for not liking it.", "NTA.  Buried in the middle of the story is a reference to your father's anger problems.  You can deal with the browbeating, you tried in so many ways to end the conversation but they wouldn't let it go. Dropping a friend of so many years is an extreme reaction but understandable if your saying that your father subjected you to angry tirades along a similar line.  So this conversation or conflict with your friends has affected your mental health. \n\nThat said, their strange obsession with proving the superiority of Italian cooking over all other cuisines is maddening.  Only \"Italian\" American's with distant ancestry to Italy act like this.  Know what they're called when they travel to Italy to sample the cuisine?  Tourists.", "NTA. Your friend needs to back way off. It\u2019s cool that he\u2019s passionate about pasta, but he needs to learn to accept that people\u2019s preferences are personal.", "\nI have never faced this exact situation, but I can imagine how difficult it can be when a disagreement with a close friend affects your mental health and daily responsibilities. This type of problem happens to many people nowadays. I suggest having an open and honest conversation with your friend. You could explain your perspective once more, emphasizing that your personal taste in food doesn't diminish your respect for Italian cuisine or culture. Remember, conflicts happen in friendships, but with open communication and a willingness to understand each other, it's possible to find common ground and strengthen your bond.", "NTA - 52 years old.  I have never once cooked pasta for myself.  I'll eat it if others make it, but I am indifferent.  I could go the rest of my life without pasta and be quite happy.", "given your friends preference for a certain orange, I would venture to guess, he may not understand that different ent cultures wan different food.  AND that the food you grow up eating usually becomes your comfort food.\n\nFor him, Italian food makes sense.  For you, it does not.  \n\nTo me, he is someone who either hasn't experienced what different cultures have to offer, or just ignores the fact that different cultures exist.  Its as if Everyone raised in the US has the exact same experience.\n\nNTA.  It Ok that you don't like pasta.", "\n>I know this is a controversial opinion\n\nWell-done steak is a controversial opinion\nNot liking pasta is a personal preference \n\nNTA\n\nI'm a born in Korea immigrant and I dont like tteok*. It happens.  People think I'm crazy for it but not an a. h. \nException - sirutteok with persimmon dip once a year.", "NTA\n\nFfs... It's a matter of personal taste. Your friend is a massive AH for not accepting you can have diverging views on food AND insisting to drag the conversation...", "NTA as you said, it is about what you are used to. I also think that Pottuguese food is the best in the world and very underrated, but I know it is because that's what I grew up with. Just like I hate barbecues full of sauces because we just put salt on our meat while barbecuing. It is taste, and you are just expressing yours, nothing wrong with that. Is there anything you know they don't like and is an unpopular opinion? Throw that back at them as a comparison.", "NTA\n\nNobody is an AH for not liking certain foods and insisting that people have to like them is an AH move.  (I love pasta, but I'd pick Korean over pasta any day of the week)", "NTA, but if you\u2019re seriously considering ending a 20+ year friendship because he was weirded over something that for most people would be weird (pasta is widely liked), then you\u2019d be an AH.", "NTA for not liking pasta. YTA for thinking of lessening the friendship over it. It's not a big deal here. Your friend is weird for taking it so harshly but in reality a 1/4th italian shouldn't be taking this so hard. \n\nI'm roughly 1/5th Italian and pasta is one of my favorite things to eat but \"to each their own\" is a pretty simple concept.\n\nAlso confrontation is a part of life. Just cause your dad was a dick doesn't mean you need to avoid confrontation", "NTA he sounds like he has never had Korean food. Real cosmopolitan! /s", "yta everyone likes pasta you psycho", "ESH. As a fellow Korean, I also grew up with Korean food. There are plenty of great Korean noodle dishes.\n\nAlso, Italian food is awesome.

I ate my birth country's cuisine that I couldn't find in the current country I live in. I totally got roasted by all the Italian (actual people from the mother land) people that I knew.

Wasn\u2019t able to include all context with character limit. I know at his core he\u2019s a kind person but I think alcohol brings out a different side to him.

I\u2019ve been trying to get better at conflict resolution but it\u2019s been difficult. Childhood trauma and all that jazz lol. I tried to explain my reasoning but I felt as though i wasn\u2019t able to get my point across. In those scenarios I typically exit the situation so it doesn\u2019t escalate and I say or do something I don\u2019t mean.
