If you can find her a residential treatment center or into temporary housing for unwed mothers or something, great! But also know that doing so is not your responsibility. One idea that comes to mind is reaching out to the Catholic diocese in your area. They often have housing for pregnant women in difficult situations (regardless of the person\u2019s religious affiliation). Hopefully they\u2019ll be happy to take her in and get her some help.

Why are you tolerating this in your own home? NTA but you seriously need to put your foot down and stand up for yourself. Take her to a hospital if she\u2019s willing.

You will NEVER get her out, and I can guarantee she's going to pull stuff to say she lives there. I wouldn't give her the opportunity. I can see you being stuck there with her and her two kids.

UGHHHHH the hypocrisy.)\n\n I truly wish that CPS had the authority to require parenting classes or a supervision program similar to probation where they drug test you and whatnot.\n\nTo clarify, this was what I was told many years ago (probably about 12 or 13)by CPS in Florida when I tried to report an acquaintance for similar behavior while pregnant. In hindsight, they probably just didn't have the resources to deal with it. There's so many people in poverty and addiction where I'm from. They need help, not to be condemned for their struggles. But obviously... You know. Florida. \n\nBtw, kid came out with FAS and she lost custody. No idea what happened to the child. Poor kid.\n\nSide note: a girl that I was in rehab with found out she was pregnant the second week there. Instead of going to the halfway house that the rest of us were encouraged to go to, she was able to go to a special halfway house for pregnant women and women with young children. IIRC, she was able to stay for up to 3 years. She stayed clean and her baby did great. Obviously she had an opportunity to get better that many low income women /people are simply unable to afford.\n\nAddiction fucking sucks.\n\nEdit: NTA. in the future, PLEASE lock your doors, even when you are home!!!

Neither of them had jobs, and they trashed the room and let their little dog shit everywhere in there to the point that the smell was permeating the entire apartment.\n\nI finally got a peak into their room and it was so disgusting I went off on them and told them they had to leave. They were pissed at me at the time but now that we've grown they understand they were way wrong and we've made up and are really great friends now.\n\nBut yeah, helping someone is great until they take advantage and trample all over your generosity.
