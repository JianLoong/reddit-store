I had to keep my dog from attacking her. After asking her what she was doing at my home unannounced she told me that she was staying with a mutual friend, but that friend put her out. I told her then that she couldn't stay more than 14 days or else I am in violation of my lease and I can be evicted... Fast forward. I had a 24 pack of Coronas. After going to sleep and waking up the next morning she had drank 16 beers, finished a half liter of rum, and 5 of my cigarettes. The only reason that I let her stay longer than 14 days was because she is pregnant. But, she isn't concerned about the welfare of her unborn children.

You didn't invite her she was already rude. Your house, your rules. I'd kick her out too :/", "NTA but throw her out immediately!", "This is not a good situation at all. Call child welfare maybe?

What is going to happen when the babies come? She needs much bigger help than you were ever able to give her. Sitting in her urine??? This is a mental health issue and you need to get people involve that can actually help her and the babies. \n\nNTA", "Unfortunately, you've let her stay and now you're going to play hell trying to evict her.", "NTA She isn't your problem. They have homeless shelters. Drop her off at one. Her friend threw her ass out, you can do the same.", "NTA but lock your doors when you get home wtf?!", "Yes. She gets foodstamps, but I think that's all she wants.", "She's pregnant with twins. I didn't mention that.", "Unfortunately, I am questioning myself. She's causing herself and the babies harm in my home; I can only imagine what could happen in the streets. Plus, my last friend that stayed with me jumped in front of a train after she left my home. I recently stopped blaming myself for her death.", "I really don't want to get the cops involved. Hopefully,  it doesn't come to that because I will.", "She said that there is a waiting list for the shelter. I don't know how true that is or isn't.", "Good rule of thumb. If they are kicked out of a friends place there is a good reason.", "I called child services. I was told that there is nothing they can do until she gives birth. Then, the hospital will test the babies urine for abusive substances and open a case upon their findings. She said that she is on a waiting list for the shelter.", "Three days is too much time?", "Child protective services or the equivalent need to be made aware of her. Nothing can be done to stop her drinking etc (other than offering support) but that baby will need protecting when they\u2019re born", "Doesn't change anything, she's being disrespectful, it's not your responsability, you let her stay at your place and she's doing things like PISSING ON YOUR COUCH, what???", "That\u2019s worse Because it\u2019s 2 potential children who could suffer with life long issues thanks to their mothers behaviour", "So she's drinking for three then? NTA", "How hard it may be she's not your problem.\n\nIt's not your wife nor your kid.\nShe's doing harm to herself and her kid.\n\nYour friend who jumpt would do if anyway, they are long gone in their head if they do this and there's a fat change you could so anything about it.\nI'm glad you stopped blaming yourself. \n\nMaybe you can call a Docter or someone who can help her in your country ?", "The longer you let her stay the harder it will be to get her out. And once her babies are born she'll try to make you be her unpaid babysitter and take care of the kids. You have to put a stop to this now and change your locks.", "They might be in a better position to connect her with some resources, some departments have mental health professionals on staff to help tackle situations like this.", "They also usually have rules about substance use.", "Absolutely. She is a lazy freeloading drunk who pissed on your couch. And call the cops if she won\u2019t leave!", "She literally followed you home, wandered into your house, drank all your beer, pissed all over your couch, and said \"I live here now\"\n\nImagine literally anyone else doing this.

You need to remember to prioritize your well-being too. Best of luck.", "Your words are endearing. Thank you.", "NTA, get her out, she is just taking advantage of your generosity.", "Some people are homeless because no one can live with them. I had a friend from high school who lived near me when we were both in our late forties and she would periodically show up needing five bucks, needing a drink when all I had in was cooking sherry that she would happily drink - I knew she was about to come homeless and at no point did I ever suggest that she come live with us. You could look at her and know that she was ill and she died around 15 years ago and I'm sure it was from liver disease. She had family nearby and they could have taken her.", "You know that drug and alcohol test new mothers at the hospital these days?\n\n You can call CPS now. And in no time at all she'll be in a safe place where she can't get to anybody's booze for a while.\n\nShe'll be warm and housed and fed. The kids will be born better off", "What the fuck . I'd kick her out immediately\n\nNTA", "are you sure she is definitely pregnant and doesn\u2019t have liver disease? this can make your belly swell!!", "NTA but get rid of that thing and lock your doors in the future", "Hmm I wonder why friend threw her out. She sounds delightful. Get her out now before she forces you to go through an eviction. You don't owe her anything. Also contact CPS as she clearly does care about her kids. NTA", "Okay.. so maybe I'm getting caught up in little details. But do you still live in your childhood home? If not how the hell did she find where you lived?! Like... that is major creepy just showing up at home and her having basically moved herself in. Nta. Call shelters yourself to see if she's telling the truth. It sounds like she needs major help - I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't want to go to a shelter because of her behavior.", "Nta, are youa  charity? If not show her the door", "NTA there's a reason she was kicked out of her previous place.", "NTA. Actually you\u2019re TA to yourself for putting up with all that for longer than 14 days. You might also be TA to her unborn babies for not reporting her drinking to someone. Maybe the police, maybe CPS. Not sure who, but someone.", "Look up programs that can help her, get her in touch with them,and drop her at a shelter.\n\nShe is an addict, a user, a stalker, and a home invader.", "NTA. Call the cops or social services.", "NTA. Life is so funny it\u2019s always disasters like this woman having babies and twins at that! Poor babies deserve better.", "Call CPS.", "NTA. Now you see why she was kicked out of her other friends place. Time for her to find another friend to mooch off of. If she doesn't care about the welfare of her unborn children, then you really shouldn't either. Sad but true.", "Give her money for an abortion and kick her out.", "NTA.  She wouldn't even be allowed to stay the 14 days.  I'm not even going to get into a pregnant woman drinking and smoking.  This woman followed you home!  That alone was a red flag!  Get her out.", "She's establishing residency. No days. Have the police escort her out. NTA.  Pregnant women get priority at women's shelters.", "NTA. There are tons of resources and shelters for pregnant women. It's not your responsibility.  Plus, she has been completely disrespectful & rude - I'd have kicked her out immediately after finding my alcohol had been guzzled up!", "NTA. This woman clearly needs help but it\u2019s up to her whether or not to accept it. You are not responsible for providing her shelter. Being pregnant does not give her carte blanche to do whatever she wants in your home. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but I\u2019d get her out of there ASAP. If you can find her a residential treatment center or into temporary housing for unwed mothers or something, great! But also know that doing so is not your responsibility. One idea that comes to mind is reaching out to the Catholic diocese in your area. They often have housing for pregnant women in difficult situations (regardless of the person\u2019s religious affiliation). Hopefully they\u2019ll be happy to take her in and get her some help. Either way, she followed you home, ruined your couch and helped herself to your things without asking. This isn\u2019t your fault and recognizing that you\u2019re neither equipped nor responsible for this situation will hopefully alleviate your guilt.", "NTA\n\nBut you should\u2019ve told her to get out the first day. Pregnant or not, don\u2019t stalk and break into someone\u2019s home. Then make a mess at the same time. You really need to get her out of your house asap. She shouldn\u2019t have had any days there at all. If she was willing to just pop up on you, she\u2019s not going to leave that easily. At the very least, you should\u2019ve called the mutual friend and asked why she was put out before letting her stay. People don\u2019t just kick pregnant women out for no reason.", "Kick her the hell out. No wonder why she got kicked out of her old place. She can be someone else\u2019s problem. NTA.", "NTA but please contact child services and let them know that she is homeless and drinking. Those babies need saving.", "You should call a social worker.", "ok im probably gonna be called an asshole for saying this but are you absolutely sure she's pregnant and not just really big. i mean people get mistaken for being pregnant when they're not all the time so maybe she just looks it and has gone with the whole pregnancy story as a way to have people feel sorry for her and give her a place to stay and whatnot because shes \"pregnant\"", "She\u2019s not simply behaving badly, this is clearly a mental health crisis. NTA but this woman needs more help than you can provide, she needs medical assistance.", "Definitely sounds like mental illness. \n\nBut it\u2019s not illegal to drink while pregnant (in the US.) The hospital tests most babies at birth and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d meet the criteria for testing.", "That makes it worse. She\u2019s drinking heavily and smoking while pregnant, she\u2019s been thrown out of all her accommodation, she pissed on your sofa and slept in it for days. This woman is not stable, not looking after herself or the twins and she is NOT your problem. You should never have let her stay! She followed you home, walked in and laid claim to your home and you let her????????? \n\n\nThrow her out immediately, call the cops if she won\u2019t go and wash your hands of this. Not your circus, not your monkeys. This is well above Reddit\u2019s pay grade.", "And an alcoholic. Those twins will need NICU time, and likely care for the rest of their lives, from FAS.\n\n\n\nThis is outside your scope of control, hun. You need to self preserve. If you want to feel better, do a little research and print her out a list of local resources, and offer her a ride to the closest welfare office. But nothing more. NTA.", "That don't matter. She's overstayed her welcome. Risking the health of her unborn children, and going to get you in trouble. \n\nThere was a reason that her other friends kicked her out. Do it now before she tries to establish squatter rights or anything", "Have a heart, she\u2019s drinking for 3 now\u2026..", "Bruh", "And please lock your door. NTA.", "Man, you've put yourself in a great position to get evicted!  She pegged you and pounced!  Get yourself into therapy asap if you're not already in it.  I understand wanting to be kind & helpful but there should be a limit to that and you're too lacking in self preservation skills to realize it.  You're extremely easily taken advantage of and that can be physically dangerous for you.   YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WOMAN IS CAPABLE OF!!!!", "I take it you've never owned a cat ;)", "Start with the emergency room. If she is drinking to the point of blacking out and urinating herself both her and the babies need serious help. They will call CPS no doubt. Then just leave. Don't take on someone like this, they will bleed you dry BELIEVE ME. She's inevitably going to lose her kids once they're born, but that's absolutely for the best. Get her to an ER.", "I am side-eyeing my cat as I check to see if any alcohol is missing now. \ud83e\udd23"]}
