If you can find her a residential treatment center or into temporary housing for unwed mothers or something, great! But also know that doing so is not your responsibility. One idea that comes to mind is reaching out to the Catholic diocese in your area. They often have housing for pregnant women in difficult situations (regardless of the person\u2019s religious affiliation). Hopefully they\u2019ll be happy to take her in and get her some help.

In hindsight, they probably just didn't have the resources to deal with it. There's so many people in poverty and addiction where I'm from. They need help, not to be condemned for their struggles. But obviously... You know. Florida. \n\nBtw, kid came out with FAS and she lost custody. No idea what happened to the child. Poor kid.\n\nSide note: a girl that I was in rehab with found out she was pregnant the second week there. Instead of going to the halfway house that the rest of us were encouraged to go to, she was able to go to a special halfway house for pregnant women and women with young children. IIRC, she was able to stay for up to 3 years. She stayed clean and her baby did great. Obviously she had an opportunity to get better that many low income women /people are simply unable to afford.\n\nAddiction fucking sucks.\n\nEdit: NTA. in the future, PLEASE lock your doors, even when you are home!!!

She\u2019s a stranger who isn\u2019t helping you at all and is disrespecting your property. She needs to go! Take her to a shelter and give her some money. She\u2019s not your responsibility and change your locks just in case. Don\u2019t let this person play on your sympathy get her out of your house. Sorry about your friend usually people who decide to do that have their mind made up regardless of what you do they already decided that was what they were going to do. Can\u2019t blame yourself for that.", "Nta get her out before she goes into labor. She going to dump those kids on you and disappear", "NTA, kick her to the curb.\n\nI know you're being sympathetic because she's pregnant and while that is noble of you, she's absolutely taking advantage of your kindness. To be blunt, if she's downing 16 beers and half a litre of rum while very pregnant, it's not looking good for the fetus. You need to get her out of there so that you stop feeling guilty for what she's choosing to do to her fetal twins.\n\nSpecial note for the couch pissing: homeless people aren't typically just feral people who piss and shit wherever they want to. She did that because she's a drunk.\n\nYou have to tell her in no kind words to get the fuck out.", "NTA I would call the police to have her removed though. She may become violent or accuse you of being violent. Call the non emergency line and explain the situation and ask for an officer to be present when you tell her she has to leave and while she gets her things. CPS may also be an option with the large amount of drinking she is doing, as those kids are likely to need services once they are born.", "Is she pregnant or is it a beer belly or tumor?  If you didn't see the ultrasound, don't believe it. NTA.", "She needs to be reported to someone. Fetal alcohol syndrome is horrible", "NTA. She's trying to get squatter's rights to your home. Give her -0- time to be gone. Call the police.", "NTA\n\nHow is any of this your problem. Connect her with resources, don\u2019t bring her in your home.", "NTA how on earth could you be consider TA in this situation.", "Don't give her 14 days. She would be straight out. NTA.", "NTA get this woman out of your house ASAP", "NTA I would never have let her stay - who follows someone home and just barges into their home? Kick her to the curb, she sounds disgusting and a little unhinged.", "NTA!\n\nThis woman is in the position she's in because she's got a big problem with alcohol. She will shit all over your house for as long as you allow it, or maybe rob you or even drink herself to death in your home. This is a dumpster fire of the highest caliber. I'm trying to think of what I would do in your position, and the only thing I can come up with is I would call the cops. They would know better than you or I where she needs to go. Those unborn babies need protection from her, but it's not your job to do that.", "She peed on your couch night one. Kick her out, she'll probably defecate night two.", "NTA it\u2019s her problem not yours", "INFO:\n\n> Fast forward.\n\nWhat?", "Those poor kiddies.\n\nPhone child services, those kids are probably going to be addicted to alcohol.\n\nShe needs seriously help and a reality check.\n\nYNTA", "are u sure she isnt just fat? how do u know she is pregnant?\n\nand u should have removed her day 1. \n\nnta. she needs to go", "one question why did you allowed a homeless person to live in your home.then she drank your liquor urinated on your couch and you're like you have 14 days like i just can't understand any of this.i mean it's good she was your high school friend but you're doing it to yourself.shitty people gonna do shitty things but you're like it's fine it's your home.", "INFO: ???? WTF? Obviously the stuff at the end, yeah she robbed you. But this person literally just burst into your home unannounced, and your reaction is to say \"she couldn't stay more than 14 days\"?? Are you OK? Like why on earth was that your reaction?", "NTA. I actually had this problem when I got my first place out of my parents.\n\nMy brother and his expecting wife were evicted from their trailer home because it had become unsafe. At the time I didn't know how or why, but I offered to let them crash in my spare room until they found a new place. Neither of them had jobs, and they trashed the room and let their little dog shit everywhere in there to the point that the smell was permeating the entire apartment.\n\nI finally got a peak into their room and it was so disgusting I went off on them and told them they had to leave. They were pissed at me at the time but now that we've grown they understand they were way wrong and we've made up and are really great friends now.\n\nBut yeah, helping someone is great until they take advantage and trample all over your generosity. Then you have to take a stand for your own well being. NTA for sure.", "NTA. Of fact if anything you\u2019ve said is true you went out of your way to be kind to her and her baby. Kick her out, change the locks, your number, whatever reasonable thing you have to do get rid of her. Kick her out ASAP. Today.", "Zero fucks even if she is the next octo-mom. Get rid of her.", "Call children's services.", "That doesn\u2019t matter.  She is damaging them by drinking.  She gets no consideration.  Not sure if CPS can do anything since the kids haven\u2019t been born yet, but I\u2019d report her now so there is a record.  If they test the babies for substances when they are born it may help prove a history of disregard for the children.", "Are you sure she is pregnant if she is drinking?  Or was that a lie to try to guilt you into letting her stay?", "If you give an opportunist an inch, they\u2019ll take a mile. She doesn\u2019t care about her babies, and letting her stay with you isn\u2019t doing anything beneficial for either of you. Kick her out.", "If you give birth to a baby with FAS it is illegal you\u2019ll go to jail and have your baby removed from your custody. And if she\u2019s drinking 16 beers and half a liter of rum on a random Tuesday then her baby is more than likely going to be born with FAS\u2026", "I think we know why she is no longer staying with the original friend.", "She also broke into the house", "And probably rules about where one can use the bathroom. I can completely see why no one is taking her in.", "That was the first thought I had. This baby will have FASD. \n\nIdk know if she\u2019ll face charges bc they\u2019ve really started to move towards treatment instead but she can definitely have her kid taken.", "Murderers do that.....", "It\u2019s possible she has some mental health issues\u2014many homeless people do.", "Yeaa, this part too, she's kinda creepy ngl", "Currently in New York, CPS does not remove children from homes where caregivers are substance users until it results in visible physical harm to the child. I have had so many babies, who either had neonatal abstinence syndrome or came in because they were neglected, to parents who were clearly high throughout the stay, if they bothered to show up at all.  We called CPS on one mom, and the worker told us that they no longer drug test parents and if her program has documented that she\u2019s compliant, they will not take action. Home checks now literally consist of a count of adequate beds for the number of children in the household and food in the fridge. \n\nSimultaneously we\u2019ve had several young children and toddlers come in with opioid ingestion, one was a suspected attempted murder. Only then were the children removed from those homes. \n\nIt fucking kills me every time.", "And a Substance Use Disorder as well."]}
