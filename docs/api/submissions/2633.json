She was at a bus stop with a bunch of bags and very pregnant. We chatted for a bit and then I gave her my number and went about my way. Later on in the evening I had just walked my dog and my door was unlocked. She comes straight through my front door, no knock no warning (she followed me home). I had to keep my dog from attacking her. After asking her what she was doing at my home unannounced she told me that she was staying with a mutual friend, but that friend put her out. I told her then that she couldn't stay more than 14 days or else I am in violation of my lease and I can be evicted... Fast forward. I had a 24 pack of Coronas. After going to sleep and waking up the next morning she had drank 16 beers, finished a half liter of rum, and 5 of my cigarettes. The only reason that I let her stay longer than 14 days was because she is pregnant. But, she isn't concerned about the welfare of her unborn children.

What about a women's shelter for her?", "Ah. Now you see why she was kicked out & has no where else to go. These are her decisions.", "NTA. Please call child services, or a local women\u2019s shelter. There is no reason she should be drinking while pregnant, and the urinating on your couch sounds like mental illness to me.", "NTA. You didn't invite her she was already rude. Your house, your rules. I'd kick her out too :/", "NTA but throw her out immediately!", "This is not a good situation at all. Call child welfare maybe? It\u2019s pretty clear why her previous hosts kicked her out. The longer she stays with you, the more claim she will have to this residence even if she pays no rent.

You've done what you can to help.\n\nYou're a soft touch and easily manipulated by people like this. She's taking advantage of your kindness.", "NTA you need to immediately call CPS or even Law Enforcement and let them know the situation.

They have homeless shelters. Drop her off at one. Her friend threw her ass out, you can do the same.", "NTA but lock your doors when you get home wtf?!", "Yes. She gets foodstamps, but I think that's all she wants.", "She's pregnant with twins. I didn't mention that.", "Unfortunately, I am questioning myself. She's causing herself and the babies harm in my home; I can only imagine what could happen in the streets. Plus, my last friend that stayed with me jumped in front of a train after she left my home.

If they are kicked out of a friends place there is a good reason.", "I called child services. I was told that there is nothing they can do until she gives birth.
