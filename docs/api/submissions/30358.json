We\u2019re getting to the point now of talking about marriage and things like that, but we both still live at home because I just finished college and he had a failed roommate experience a couple months ago. \n\nI asked him where we would live if we hypothetically got married, and he said we could live with his parents for a while. I said no because I know his parents would hate that and I would hate that too. I like his parents but I don\u2019t think that would work very well, especially if we wanna make our own family some day. \nHe told me he never wants to leave the house he grew up in, but especially his mom. They have a very co dependent relationship I think, I feel like he wouldn\u2019t be happy anywhere if his mom isn\u2019t there. \n\nHe got mad at me and called me rude because I didn\u2019t wanna move into his parents house. I thought I wasn\u2019t overreacting but he\u2019s still mad at me. Am I the asshole? \n\nTl;Dr bf wants me to move in with him and his parents if we ever get married", "created_utc": 1699167044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17o6a54/aita_for_not_wanting_to_move_in_with_my/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Girl, run!! Now! Unless you want to be married to him and his mom. You will always be the third wheel for everything. Every important decision and milestone will have to include his mom, and her opinion and wants will outweigh yours. Every decision about your wedding, how you spend and save money, your kids, and every little discussion or argument will be vetted through his mom.", "NTA. And time to think long and hard about this relationship. He says he has a co-dependant relationship with his mother, and wants to live in his parents home forever, even if he were married (to you). Is that the life you want? I wouldn't recommend it.", "NTA red flag. You will never compete with his mom, or, more likely, you will always be competing with his mom. That's not a life. \n\nImagine this scenario: You have a child. You believe strongly that X is good for this child. Your MIL thinks that Y is better.  How will your husband handle that and the thousands of other scenarios that come with this situation. Please rethink the whole thing while you are young and haven't invested decades.", "Nta. Major red flag. Is the reason to roommate situation didn't work out because your bf isn't capable of living on their own without their mother?", " NTA. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. RUN. \n\nLet him marry his mom.", "NTA, he has a problem not you.  \nUnless he has a brilliant plan about staying with them to save during X time for whatever reason, but then he could do it without you moving in and just waiting, so nah, be aware because his mom will become part of your relationship.", "NTA, unless you actually marry him. He\u2019s already in a relationship with his mother, and you\u2019ll never come first with him.", "NTA, after hearing that I\u2019d break up immediately. He\u2019s childish and needs to grow up, he wants to get married and have his own family but expect to live with mommy and daddy forever?? Ew \ud83d\udea9", "NTA. You're wise to realize it would be a mistake. No offense, but your BF isn't ready to be in a serious relationship.", "My word. You should check out the stories at r/jnmil and see what a future with a spineless mummy's boy brings you, then run. Run fast.\n\nNTA but you will be to yourself if you settle for this boy all tangled up in his mamas apron strings.", "NTA for not wanting to live with the inlaws- but if you don't want to end things, ask him if he is willing to compromise and live close to his parents.", "NTA.  How long is \"for a while?\"  Does he mean a few months?  A few years?  If he really means just a few months, its not a bad solution until you can find an apartment.  If it's longer, run.", "Do not move in with his parents! This would be a deal breaker for me. Read r/justnoMIL to see why you should run.", "**RUN!!!! DO NOT LOOK BACK!!!  RUN!!!**", "NTA. Make it clear that you will not live with your in-laws in a calm tone. And if you guys are gonna go to the next step in your relationship, he needs to understand it is a partnership, and both of your views and wishes matter. \n\nIf you want to move in, you can then recommend to move to a place close to his parents home. That is if you are comfortable with that idea and wish to find a common ground. But remember, marriage is not something to go into lightly, and unless you guys can agree on certain issues (kids, finances, goals, living arrangements, etc.), it might not be for you.", "NTA\n\nMoving in with his parents is a very bad idea and will most likely be the death of your relationship. It\u2019s their house, their rules, you will be the \u201cguest\u201d that never leaves and everyone will resent everyone by the end. You will lose. If you want to live with your boyfriend you two need to get an apartment together, however small it may be in order to be in your own space and own relationship. Your boyfriend will probably always choose his mom over you, assuming you remain a couple. Sorry girl but I\u2019ve seen it happen", "NTA\nmy husband still receives tighty whitey underwear for christmas from his mom at age 44. they visit every week.\nrun!! mama will always come first before you. please get out before you marry him.", "Never ever ever ever ever ever move in with the in laws. We did it for a week in between houses before getting married. It's terrible", "NTA. This is not the msn for you", "Sorry but from everything you\u2019ve described you are both way too young and immature to get married.

Never be as good. The only reason OP is there is as a bang maid.", "I was wondering this as well... What exactly happened for the roommate situation not to work?", "Probably never was a roommate, he likely made that story up", ">NTA. How long is \"for a while?\" Does he mean a few months? A few years? If he really means just a few months, its not a bad solution until you can find an apartment. If it's longer, run.\n\nHe told her he never wants to leave", "Put aside for a moment how much you love him, and assume that his goals for his life remain the same.\n\nHe doesn't imagine a life with you as his partner.  If he draws his inner circle, with him and one other person in it, that person is not you.\n\nDon't plan your life around a relationship that is unattainable.", "Your intuition is screaming at you, I think you should listen.\n\nA long lasting healthy relationship is built on trust, respect, and communication. It doesn't matter how much you claim to love each other, without these things being present and always equally worked on you will end up misrable at best, and in a relationship full of toxicity and abuse at worst. And he has proven he doesn't respect you, and is not willing to have open communication about important issues. I can take an educated guess that the trust in your relationship isn't all that great either, given the way he is treating you about this as well. \n\nTake this as a lesson learned... I am guessing you saw the warning signs before, that something like this would end up happening, but ignored them thinking he would change as he got older or whatever. Well, this isn't going to change, and seems to be getting even worse if he went from a failed roommate situation to living with his parents again. So cut your losses, and go find someone who isn't going to choose his mom over you when it comes to who he wants to marry and have a family with.", "Please break up now. You don\u2019t want to spend your life being the side-piece in a man\u2019s committed relationship with his mum.", "Ok, this is really simple. He has TOLD YOU how he plans to live his life and how he sees his future.\n\nIf you do not like his plans, DO NOT think you can \u201cchange him\u201d. You\u2019re either going to have to with what he wants or move on with your life.\n\nYou already said he has a codependent relationship with his mom. THIS WILL NOT CHANGE.\n\nIf you are not (repeat\u2026NOT) ok with HIS future plans DO NOT waste any more years on this relationship.\n\nYour life right now is setup to be a lifetime of compromise and doing this you don\u2019t want to do. A lifetime is a long time\u2026\n\nNothing else needs to be said to this post. Either you\u2019re going to stay and enjoy the ride or you\u2019re going to leave and start new. \n\nNTA", "Yes but he also said \"for awhile\". There is a vast difference between the two so I am trying to figure out what he expects realistically.", "They can look for an apartment with their current living situation and skip living with his parents altogether. And it doesn\u2019t really matter what he expects \u201crealistically\u201d the fact that he said he never wants to leave is a screaming red flag. He realistically expects to live there as long as possible, hopefully op just dumps him before getting into that mess", "May be a cultural difference.  It\u2019s not that big a deal here where I live.", "Right I think it is. And the issue is that OP clearly is way against the idea and he\u2019s not listening or budging. If she moves in he\u2019s never going to move out. \n\nI don\u2019t think this is a cultural thing, more of a mamas boy thing", "Assumptions abound with this one.  Perhaps why I asked the question in the first place.", "I mean she literally states that he said he doesn\u2019t want to leave his mom", "Again that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t.  Preference does not equal action.", "But he\u2019s being demanding of it now when she clearly doesn\u2019t want to do that. So why should she even take the risk"]}
