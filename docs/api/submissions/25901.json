We grew up completely different. She's the only child of a surgeon father. Her mother died when she was 2 and it was her and her father for most of her life. He remarried when she was 17. He's wealthy, sent her to private school, paid for her college, and when we met a decade ago he was still paying her rent, even though she had a solid job. I come from a poor family. But we both have pretty good jobs and make around the same amount of money now.\n\nShe is such a daddy's girl and it's been affecting our relationship. Anytime she wants or needs something, she goes to her dad first. And sometimes it's about things I could help with. I work in tech and back when we started dating she was starting grad school and she asked her dad \"what laptop should I get\"  I told her I actually work in the field (which she already knew) and could easily answer that and get her what she needs and she just kind of shrugged. Okay fine. These little things have happened throughout the last decade. But, there have been bigger issues recently.\nLast year, she decided she needs a new car. I disagreed. Her car is fine and she works from home and barely drives. She was adamant, though. About a month later, she tells me she's getting a new car. I told her we need to make these decisions together and we share finances and this is a major purchase. She says, \"oh, my dad is buying it. He said we can just sell mine and get some extra money.\" I told her it's kind of ridiculous to ask her dad to buy her a brand new car when she has a perfectly good one and we don't need it anyways. She got upset and said it's not that big of a deal and her dad doesn't mind and that the car \"wasn't that expensive anyways.\" She said I'm overreacting and that it's okay for her dad to do nice things for her. She got a brand new 2022 car completely paid for by her dad. And we sold her old one. \nNow, we are buying a new house. We've finally narrowed it down to two options. We were discussing it last week and my wife says \"oh I don't think house A is good my dad said he think we could do a lot better in our budget.\" Before she talked to her dad, she LOVED House A. So, I got a bit frustrated and said it didn't matter what her dad thought because this is our family's home and he won't be living there. She got angry. We started arguing. We both said mean things. I called her a spoiled brat and said she needed to grow up and she got upset and slept in the guest room and has it's been a few days and we have barely spoken. She said I was \"so mean\" to her.", "created_utc": 1693456799, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16616fo/aita_for_calling_my_35m_wife_35f_a_spoiled_brat/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a great way to lose your marriage otherwise. \n\nDeal with your issues instead of hurting your wife. You show nothing but mild contempt for your wife here", "YTA\n\nYou just sound super insecure about her Father. Take a moment to reflect you're on reddit complaining she asked her Dad for advice on a laptop.\n\nYou're jealous. That's all there is to it and it's pathetic.

Just insane.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you want her to take your advice on everything and not her dads.  It might be that she grew up not wanting for anything and seemingly still doesn't but you have been with her for a long time so its not as though you haven't been aware of it.\n\nIf he is willing to fund stuff then just enjoy it as most people would be quite happy with someone buying them a new car.", "When you get married you leave your primary family behind and start your own.", "NTA\n\nCan\u2019t be wrong for saying something that is clearly true", "YTA \n\nWhen you married her, you basically accepted her for who she is which includes that she\u2019s daddy\u2019s girl. Did you guys ever discussed expectations about this dynamic before the marriage? If you didn\u2019t then than that\u2019s something you will have to deal with and name calling her will not solve your issues. Seek a marriage counselor to help mediate this.", "YTA  You knew from the very beginning. Why did you think she would change? She was the only daughter of a wealthy widower. They don't come any more dependent than that! If you don't accept it, you may as well make plans to leave. Seems you have little respect for her. Sorry.", "YTA. You got mad she asked her dad what kind of laptop to get? Ridiculous. Just because you got married doesn\u2019t mean her dad isn\u2019t part of her life anymore. I agree financial decisions should be made together. She wanted the car, you said no. There was no compromise on your part at all, no conversation just a no we don\u2019t need it, so I see why she went to her dad. Now you have a new safe car that you didn\u2019t have to pay for, plus extra cash from the sold car. Sounds like you might be jealous. \n\nRegarding the house, parents typically bring the reality to situations. Maybe she liked house A and was excited but couldn\u2019t see the reality so her dads job was to make her see maybe it\u2019s not worth the money. That maybe you could get a more move in ready home, or one with a better yard, or extra bathroom. It doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love it anymore, just that maybe there\u2019s something better for the budget you have. She wasn\u2019t asking her dad for money or trying to get you to spend more, she was just listening to his advice. Her dad isn\u2019t going anywhere, and just because you grew up differently doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a horrible a person just because her dad buys her things and she trusts his opinions. You were together for 5 years when you married, you knew who she was. Edit to add- my opinion would be the same if the roles were reversed.", "Yta\n\nDon't be mean to your wife.\n\nAnd a lot of this sounds like your own insecurity. Of course she respects and takes advice from her father. And he has the money so who cares if he buys her a car.\n\nThe house thing is another separate issue. But yelling at her instead of discussing it rationally isn't going to get you anywhere.", "You are jealous of her Dad.   Sounds like bruised ego to me and you are not being grown up.", "YTA, you're trying to distance your girlfriend from her dad, frankly I feel like you're jealous of her. And it's an asshole move to insult her because she has a nice father.", "YTA. Single parents who only have one child often have a much closer relationship than other families. My daughter will still call me about things that she could easily speak to her partner about but she wants my reassurance and opinion. My daughter and I are so close we can have an entire conversation that consists of 5 words which freaks her partner out, but it is what it is. \nCalling your wife a spoilt brat, suggests you see her as childish, you should apologise.", "I don't think you're the asshole for thinking as you do. If during the argument you were both calling each other names then thats clearly an ESH and the fact that she's pretty hurt by the spoiled brat remark is probably because you hit a sore spot with that one, it can be hard to hear you partner say he thinks about you in a way you don't want/like him to, especially if he kinda has a point to it. Go get counseling stuff like this can snowball into much bigger issues.", "Wow! I'm surprised at all the ytas!\n\nNTA. Your wife is depending on her dad rather than her husband. She asks his opinion instead if her husband's... Why be married?\n\nShe is a spoiled brat. She knows daddy will get her whatever she wants so she asks , gets it, and has no consideration for her spouse.\n\nI doubt this will get better but hopefully soon she will see that she is an adult in a marriage and you two can move on.", "If this was a man doing this with mother, this thread would be blowing up with people calling the man a mommas boy & how it gives them the \u201cick\u201d.", "NTA and I cannot fathom all the Y T A's.  She's married to you, things should be discussed between you two.  She doesn't get the answer so she runs to daddy to get what she wants.\n\nJust start doing the same in respect of opinions about things, ah well I spoke to my parents and they think this so we're not going to do that anymore.  Or I spoke to my parents and they think I should spend my money on this so that's what I'm going to do. Sometimes people need a mirror reflected on them.\n\nShe clearly does not respect you, your opinion or your marriage.\n\nI would suggest marriage counselling to work through both your issues.\n\nETA if you want to have kids with her you need to get this sorted out now.", "Soft YTA. You have valid concerns, but there's a way to approach this more reasonably. First, you need to come to terms with the fact that this is the relationship your wife has with her dad. It was just them for a long time and bonds strengthened in grief are hard to shake. And that's not a bad thing. She will always have some inclination to get her dad's opinion. Learn to accept that and so long as its harmless, give her room to do that without judgement. Like with the car: it's okay that you spoke your mind about not needing the car. Your points were reasonable. But at the end of the day, if it's a no strings attached gift from her dad who WANTS to do this and there's no financial burden, is this a fight worth having? You two get a nicer family car and a father gets to do something for his child. But clearly there are other instances where the overreliance on her dad is actually harming the relationship. There is room to talk about these concerns with your wife in a way where you are compassionate and understanding of their relationship, while also recognizing that your marriage (and your voice) matters too. At the end of the day, 3's a crowd. No problem with getting his input but if your wife's entire opinion on a house she loved is a complete 180 just because her dad had an opposing thought, then surely that deserves some introspection on your wife's part. But she's less likely to be open to that if you're antagonizing her and their relationship. Did you really need to call her a spoiled brat? Probably not. At the end of the day, its not about the money, the house, or a father spoiling his daughter. They have a beautiful relationship but at times at the expense of your own. Sometimes it doesnt feel like a partnership when your voice, feelings, and what you bring to the table are superseded by her dad. Making life decisions together matter. Have this conversation with an open heart and hopefully you make meaningful progress. Good luck", "Lmao. If the roles were reversed people would call the husband a mommas boy.", "NTA\n\nShe grew up with only her father being both parents. Of course he has been the main male role in her life. However, she (and her father) needs to realise that she is a grown ass married woman now, who should put her husband in the front of her life, not her daddy. I don't think you are *jealous*, you just sound like you are fed up with always playing second fiddle to her dad.", "NTA. I\u2019m a daddy\u2019s girl but I don\u2019t consult him for every decision. If my husband had to validate everything with his mum, I would be annoyed. I like to be with someone who makes his decisions like a big boy.\n\nThat being said, is it really worth a fight with your wife if everything else goes smoothly?\n\nUnless you want kids? Because if you do, be prepared to have all your views on their education be overruled by the granddad\u2019s views.", "YTA\n\nAll of this sounds like insecurities on your part. Why the hell is it your problem how her dad spends his money on her? It's not a joint financial decision anymore if it's a gift from her dad.\n\nHer dad was able to convince her that house A was not good enough. Choosing a house and changing opinions on something is normal. What, do you want to get her to agree on buying a house she no longer likes? Or is it the fact that she values her father's opinion that you're unhappy with? Do you see how ridiculous that sounds? If you're that hung up about it try and point out things worth buying house A for instead of insulting your wife and trying to estrange her from her dad.", "YTA.  You knew you married a daddy's girl before you married her.  \n\nWould it be nice to be about you and her?  Sure.  But that isn't the relationship you have.  You are married to her and her dad.", "YTA - you knew this for the past 10 years and still decided to get hitched, it\u2019s all on you mate.", "YTA, your wife got her car and you got extra money for the house fund. Or did you give the FIL the money back on principle?", "YTA. you\u2019re either jealous/insecure that you can\u2019t provide monetary wise as well as your wife\u2019s father, or jealous that she considers him an important person in her life and values his input. either way, these are both strictly You Problems to deal with", "NTA,  if the rolls had be reserved and this was man who ran to mummy all the time, it wouldnt be single YTA here.  \n\n\nYes, being mean to you wife isnt nice, but this has been boiling for a while,  you are married to her  dad's opinion .  IF you want to keep this marriage, you need counselling.", "YTA/ESH\n\nHer dad overstepped about the house, but the other stuff is perfectly valid. It's fine that she asked her dad about the laptop, and fine about the car. Why are you so angry that her father bought her a car if he could easily afford it? It feels like you are looking a gift horse in the mouth. \n\nIt feels like you let little things (the laptop, the car), which aren't worth getting riled up, build up so when you did have a legitimate gripe (the house) it all came out wrong.", "YTA.", "NTA. If this was a woman complaining about her husband running to mommy and taking mommy's advice over hers? Pretty sure the Y T A's would be few & far between.", "NTA.  I'm not sure why you two are married.  She cares more about daddy than you.\n\nBut you should know that redditors are mostly single guys with no experience with marriage", "NTA for feeling the way you do. It sounds like your wife doesn't trust herself or you to make any decisions, and instead needs her dad to approve them. That's very annoying, and also, her dad won't be around forever, and she needs to start thinking for herself. \n\nOn the other hand, you sound resentful, so you probably should have talked about this with your wife before you exploded. So, it's not a great situation, but nothing that can't be solved with better communication.", "ESH\n\nSomehow you never earned your wife\u2019s full respect. Your wife is disrespectful and doesn\u2019t put you as the number 1 man in her life.", "YTA.  You sound jealous of your wife.", "ESH. You because you called her a spoiled brat. Her because she's a spoiled brat and daddy because he doesn't respect either one of you.", "A very soft YTA.\n\nYou've been together for 10 years. You knew it was going to be like this and you chose to stick around. If extreme daddy's girl behavior upset you then you shouldn't have signed up for it.\n\nI empathize as I would never be ok with this relationship dynamic, however I never would've stayed with someone who was like this.\n\nYour wife sounds like she's always been like this. You're the one who's changed the rules, not her. She didn't deserve spoiled brat thrown at her out of the blue after 10 years of you just rolling with it.", "ESH. You should not have called her a spoiled brat. Your wife for accepting a car from her father without discussing it with you first and her father for butting in on your house hunting. This will never end. Nothing will ever be good enough for his daughter and he will continue to insert his money and opinions into your marriage until you and your wife set some boundaries and stick to them. \n\nIt\u2019s not wrong for him to want to buy her a car or other nice things but she is putting her relationship with her father over her relationship with you.", "NAH. She knows you have a lot of expertise in tech and could give her perfectly good advice about which laptop to get, but she'd rather ask her dad because she actually is a Daddy's Girl. You're never going to change that, and unfortunately you'll always be second fiddle to everything Dad says, does, and thinks.\n\nI think Dad's main motivation for giving her whatever she wants is the fact that her mother died so young and it was just the two of them until Dad remarried. Likewise, she relies on him because he was her only parent for most of her life. Again, you're never going to change the nature of their relationship, so just stop trying.\n\nAbout the only thing you can do is change how you view their relationship and react to the things he does for her and the things she asks from him. You can talk to her about it, but you probably won't get very far before you get lots of push back.", "ESH\n\n\nThe only reason I am not voting N T A, is that you knew who was when you married her.", "YTA.  If her father wants to buy her a new car, he shouldn\u2019t just because you\u2019ve decided she doesn\u2019t need one???  Controlling much?", "YTA sir, sorry! Your wife trusted her dad and respected him that is why, she always ask her dad\u2019s opinion all the time!", "YTA\n\nYou need to apologise to your wife for calling her names and being mean to her! \n\nShe's had a father that provides for her and gives advice to her all her life. You want that to stop just because she's married you? How would her father feel? He's raised his precious only daughter these many years, then you come along to ruin their relationship? You're not her father.  You're the husband.  Just because your father doesn't provide for you doesn't mean it's not normal for others.\n\nSorry to say,  but I'm the \"spoiled brat.\" Growing up in our neighbourhood, most of my friends were gifted cars once we turned 16. 3 of my guy friends had expensive posh race cars as teenagers. Many gifted houses as wedding presents. That's normal for us. Your wife didn't marry into her own financial class because she loved you. She never complained that you don't receive gifts like her friends would, then you shouldn't complain that she is receiving gifts either. \n\nMoney gets passed on through generations. Wait 20 years, when you've accumulated wealth.  I'm sure you'd also rather gift your children gifts when you're alive than to pass it all to them as inheritance when you're dead.\n\nBe grateful, man.", "YTA - you\u2019re an insecure little boy. Why did you marry her if you knew she came from parents like that? There are parents in this world that will do anything for their children no matter how old they are. If this was something that was bothering you, you could\u2019ve spoken to your wife about how it\u2019s made you feel but instead you chose the infantile her and make her feel like crap because her dad got her car. You need to deal with your own insecurities and sit down with your wife and apologize and explain how you\u2019re feeling and what solution you would like moving forward. Oh, I hope she tells her dad on you as well. So he knows what kind of son-in-law he really has. \nThere are people out there who don\u2019t even have their parents in their lives yet you\u2019re trying to break your wife because she has hers .

ESH.", "YTA\n\nListen, totally get not wanting her father\u2019s opinion to be the deciding factor in where you live. However, you should have a calm and honest conversation with her about the house issue as opposed to flying off the handle right away.\n\n\nBecause your response was so fueled by anger, it seems like a lot of that has to do with your resentment towards her attitude about money, her father\u2019s money, and his financial involvement  in her life as an adult woman. Having different attitudes towards money is a completely valid reason to not want to be a relationship with someone. Yet\u2026you\u2019ve been with her for 10 years and this has *always* been the situation, it\u2019s not a new development. So, by not breaking it off with her early on and marrying her you decided that your different attitudes about money and her father\u2019s financial involvement were not deal breakers. But here you are, angry and bitter about it. If this is how you feel, you should have broken off the relationship. Because you decided these were not deal breakers, it\u2019s only fair for you to not bring them into this argument.\n\n\nTalk to her, apologize, tell her that the conversation should have been limited to your choice in houses and you are frustrated that her fathers opinion was able to sway her so much and you still really love this house just like she did before.\n\n\nLeave all this other stuff at the door if you want your marriage to work.

If both are making good money I don't even understand what the problem is, but it seems she realized he wouldn't budge on the budget and she wanted a car, so she told her dad and basically she got a new car without spending anything.

I refuse to interfere in her relationship other than saying I'm not the one she needs to speak to.", "i mean, it sounds like you guys *did* talk about it. you didn\u2019t come to a compromise after discussing it, so she found a compromise to the situation: for her father to purchase her a new car. it takes away any financial burden you\u2019d face by her buying one, and her \u2018need\u2019 for a new car wouldn\u2019t matter \u2014 i mean, when it comes to gifts, they aren\u2019t usually contingent on a recipient\u2019s need but instead is usually based on their wants. \n\nbut, since you don\u2019t see what happen as a compromise, what exactly *would* have been a proper compromise to this issue? like her buying a car regardless of what you want is just as much **not** a compromise as her not buying a car regardless of what she wants.", "But she wants a new car which you don't have to pay or even lift a finger for it? If you felt like what you said doesn't matter, maybe you should think that what she said doesnt' matter to you as well. She wants it, just why? why you want her to not have it?", "Ahhhh\u2026.hello people\u2026.what about getting his advice on which house to buy\u2026which just happened?", "I actually got that advice. I am a woman and I had exact same issue where in our house buying decision my husband was involving his parents. And i completely agree that my husband needs to grow up.", "The house thing is suspect but OP is being so weird about a free car that I doubt the accuracy of his reporting on the house issue.", "Who cares about the genders? He has been with her for ten freaking years. He is a giant A-hole for having a problem withi it now. If a girl was dating a mamma's boy and then decided to marry him and be with him for ten years, she made her own freaking bed.   \n\n\nThe guy is a huge A-hole irrespective of whether she is a daddy's girl.", "They absolutely would be. It'll be full of warnings about strings and how MIL would always be deciding for them, including their future children's lives.", "Bought by daddy, when you\u2019re \n\nA. Working yourself ?\n\nB. Have a nice job and can easily afford one yourself ?", "If it's not high maintenance that It will hurt my economy, and she choose for herself the car? for sure! Give me the free car!", "How long have you been married?", "So my mother likes to buy her children presents. Big items I never accept (anymore) without talking it over with my husband. We are in the rel together. I value his opinion. It would be disrespectful to ignore his feelings in the matter.\n\n I had to learn this lesson over a washer and dryer. We didn't need a new one, but my mother wanted us to have all new appliances in the new home (washer, dryer, fridge, dishwasher, oven/stove, etc). I already let her buy the fridge and kind randomly told him. He felt hurt that I didn't involve him in a decision that affected him, too. \n\nHe wasn't upset that the fridge was gifted but that he wasn't consulted. It's important to work as a team. I had more of a parental relationship with my grandparents than my parents. I used to take their advice overall. But when I got with my husband, he needed to be the one I worked through things with. \n\nShe dismissed his feelings and thoughts. It was wrong. She shouldn't be building a life with someone she doesn't value.", "It\u2019s extremely normal to get parental advice on the largest purchase of your life", "My parents were in this exact situation, we were poor and my moms parents were much more well off. It leads to never actually being treated like an adult or being able to make your own decisions. OP sounds like he\u2019s taking it a bit too personally, but what happens when dad passes or can\u2019t do everything for her. That\u2019s what I\u2019d be more concerned about personally.\n\nEdit: I should say *can* be an issue. It really depends on the exact details of how these \u201cdecisions\u201d are being made. It seems like OP and his wife have different views and goals on money and rather than figuring out a compromise wife just lets dad pay for it. Which feels like just avoiding communication in a way, idk how I\u2019d feel about it tbh.", "Yeah, for all we know FIL pointed out something that they hadn\u2019t even considered about the house.", "It doubt it is just now, it seems that it was build over the years. He is just not as pity as we women would like to collect every single frigging evidence.", "This was my thought too. Like, if he had reservations about how she was a daddy\u2019s girl the time to bring it up has passed. He willfully married into their father-daughter relationship.", "Doesn't matter. It's a free car.", "The word \"daddy\" has now lost all meaning to me.", "Together 18. Married 12.\n\nThey got together after us but married first. They are a little older.", "I mean, the difference between this situation and yours is that the dad didn\u2019t approach her and say she needed a new car. she *actively wanted and felt she needed a new car*, he shut her down. she probably told her father that she needed a new car, but ultimately couldn\u2019t get one and he offered to get it for her. \n\nadditionally, he *was* not only involved in her decision, he was the person she went to **first** about the situation and they had a discussion about the whole thing. after their talk, she came away knowing his opinion on the matter: he didn\u2019t think she needed a new car, and (considering his statement upon being told she was getting a car) that since they share finances they both needed to agree to that kind of thing. removing the financial burden negates the need issue, her father buying the car did just that. \n\nthe other two examples provided don\u2019t imply that she doesn\u2019t care about his thoughts/opinions nor that she values her fathers *more* than she values his. \n\nthe first one is literally his being resentful that **a decade ago** his new girlfriend didn\u2019t ask his for his expert advice on a laptop and instead asked the person who would be purchasing the device for her. \n\nthe other is that they are making a big life decision and after a long period doing the entire process exclusively with her husband, she (presumably) was excited about finding a house, told her dad about it and then he offered an outside perspective and financial advice\u2014 which considering his net worth is something he has experience with (aka the exact thing he was upset that she didn\u2019t do 10 years ago)\u2014 it sounds like she hadn\u2019t  thought about it prior. then she expressed the advice to her husband who took is as her saying she now hates the house and that they absolutely shouldn\u2019t buy it instead of what it was: her expressing an idea she hadn\u2019t previously considered which doesn\u2019t inherently negate her feelings on the house but is something she thinks they should consider regarding purchasing that specific house. \n\nit sounds like, aside from at the beginning of their relationship, she actually *goes to her husband first* and occasionally shares stuff in her life with her fathers who offers fatherly advice, such as an outside perspective on home equity, and occasionally does nice things for his child, like buying her gifts.", "But also he didn't value her want of a new car as well?   \nIt's a totally different situation bc you don't want those things that your mom gave you, but OP wife clearly wanted a new car. She discussed it with him, but he was just not happy with it? And also it's her car, not their car, how can that affect him in anyway?", "What about laptops when your husband is in the computer field and daddy is a doctor?", "I figured that or from the wording that he was possibly implying that the house was overpriced for what they would be getting", "Yeah. I mean, I\u2019m a little distrusting of parental comments on houses after a truly stupid experience a friend had when he and his wife were looking (her parents thought there was only one possible neighborhood to live in - which they couldn\u2019t afford - and came up with really genuinely dumb excuses why anywhere else was worse, then stopped talking to my friend and wouldn\u2019t let him visit with his wife and their kid when they bought a perfectly nice house that wasn\u2019t in the Proper Location, it was all so ridiculous) but OP doesn\u2019t seem to actually know what was said.", "Oh wow. I was just going to say once you\u2019re a little older you\u2019ll get it because money always comes with strings but maybe yours didn\u2019t. Or more likely you don\u2019t mind your in laws being in control and he does.", "But he wasn't her husband. He was a guy she'd just started dating.", "But is it that big a deal? Some people like to use these things as a way to bond with their parents", "They have never shown there was strings attached. Like I said they are good people.\n\nHer grandparents passed and the house was sold. That money was split evenly.\n\nSo in a way it wasn't even the in laws money to give away I guess. Tho there was no will and that was just decided. It wasn't some big drama.\n\nWe are also not American so I think that helps. Family seems to lose importance there year by year.", "Sure it is.  She wants daddy to pay for everything and give her advice.  She\u2019s a spoiled little rich girl.", "Oh cool, where are you from?", "You sound very bitter", "New Zealand.", "Your whole country is the population of one of our midsize cities and you think you know what family means to us? Is everyone in New Zealand so arrogant? I\u2019ll wait 10 minutes so you can personally ask them all. Jerk."]}
