{"id": 25901, "submission_id": "16616fo", "title": "AITA for calling my (35m) wife (35f) a spoiled brat?", "selftext": "My wife (35F) and I (35M) have been together for 10 years, married 5. We grew up completely different. She's the only child of a surgeon father. Her mother died when she was 2 and it was her and her father for most of her life. He remarried when she was 17. He's wealthy, sent her to private school, paid for her college, and when we met a decade ago he was still paying her rent, even though she had a solid job. I come from a poor family. But we both have pretty good jobs and make around the same amount of money now.\n\nShe is such a daddy's girl and it's been affecting our relationship. Anytime she wants or needs something, she goes to her dad first. And sometimes it's about things I could help with. I work in tech and back when we started dating she was starting grad school and she asked her dad \"what laptop should I get\"  I told her I actually work in the field (which she already knew) and could easily answer that and get her what she needs and she just kind of shrugged. Okay fine. These little things have happened throughout the last decade. But, there have been bigger issues recently.\nLast year, she decided she needs a new car. I disagreed. Her car is fine and she works from home and barely drives. She was adamant, though. About a month later, she tells me she's getting a new car. I told her we need to make these decisions together and we share finances and this is a major purchase. She says, \"oh, my dad is buying it. He said we can just sell mine and get some extra money.\" I told her it's kind of ridiculous to ask her dad to buy her a brand new car when she has a perfectly good one and we don't need it anyways. She got upset and said it's not that big of a deal and her dad doesn't mind and that the car \"wasn't that expensive anyways.\" She said I'm overreacting and that it's okay for her dad to do nice things for her. She got a brand new 2022 car completely paid for by her dad. And we sold her old one. \nNow, we are buying a new house. We've finally narrowed it down to two options. We were discussing it last week and my wife says \"oh I don't think house A is good my dad said he think we could do a lot better in our budget.\" Before she talked to her dad, she LOVED House A. So, I got a bit frustrated and said it didn't matter what her dad thought because this is our family's home and he won't be living there. She got angry. We started arguing. We both said mean things. I called her a spoiled brat and said she needed to grow up and she got upset and slept in the guest room and has it's been a few days and we have barely spoken. She said I was \"so mean\" to her.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: wow did not expect this to get so much traction. This was mostly a late night stream of consciousness and I realize I left a lot out, of course. I DID apologize to my wife for the name calling and we both agreed we have some issues to work through. Here's some more info for context and to answer some questions I've seen asked: \n\n1. We could have afforded the car on our own. We do well for ourselves. I was not worried about not being able to afford it. I just did not understand the rationale of buying a brand new car when you have a perfectly good one. Her old car wasn't even that old. It was a 2019 and had pretty much all of the same features her new one has. It didn't make sense to me. Also, we have a toddler and it's actually harder for her to get him in the new car than the old one. She also barely drives. I mean, seriously, the car sits in the garage 90% of the time. She has even said before that she hates driving. Sure it was free but I guess it's more about the principle than the car itself. But, she got what she wanted so whatever. \n\n2. We've been together 10 years - has it always been this  way? Why did I stay? --- valid points. And something I could dig deeper on. No answer right now other than I just fell in love and didn't want to leave. \n\n3. Do I have my own daddy issues? No, not really. My dad and I are fine. My parents are still married. We were very poor growing up and my parents were undocumented, and that was a very stressful way to live but my family made it work. I live on the other side of the country now so I don't see them as much but we talk and visit regularly. \n\n4. My father in law is a nice enough guy and for what it's worth, he also says his daughter is spoiled and has made comments throughout the years about it. Obviously I didn't need to call her a spoiled brat and I recognize the difference in her dad saying it and me but I am not the first person to say it to her. I KNOW THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT. \n\n5. I recognize I have my own issues due to poverty, trauma and all of that. I have been to individual therapy. That is a forever ongoing process. \n\n6. The house: All of the reasons my wife gave me are just matters of personal preference, like \"my dad says we need a bigger kitchen,\" \"my dad says we need a bigger backyard.\" He is also convinced we will have more children even though we said we so not want anymore so he also said we need \"more rooms for more kids.\" Nothing about safety of the house, the price, etc..just things he personally doesn't like or would have different in his home. Also we've been looking for over a year and he has given his thoughts many many times throughout the year. So, I'm not saying she shouldn't ask him for advice. Also, no, he would not be paying for any of the house. \n\n7. My wife has never been to any type of counseling in her life. When I suggested grief counseling for her after I started my own she looked at me like I said something ridiculous. Her family is very skeptical about therapy. So, I'm not sure if I will get her to do marriage counseling but we will talk about this further. \n\n8. Finally, my wife is a funny, creative, and beautiful woman. She's a great mom. She makes everyone laugh. I do love her despite what the post may make some of you believe.\n\nThanks to those who sent me thoughtful messages. They provided interesting perspectives. ALSO THIS NOT A FULL PICTURE OF EVERYTHING. I'M JUST NOT WILLING TO SPEND ANYMORE TIME WRITING IT.

This is a great way to lose your marriage otherwise. \n\nDeal with your issues instead of hurting your wife. You show nothing but mild contempt for your wife here", "YTA\n\nYou just sound super insecure about her Father. Take a moment to reflect you're on reddit complaining she asked her Dad for advice on a laptop.\n\nYou're jealous. That's all there is to it and it's pathetic. Instead of worrying about her realtionship with her Father and calling her names why aren't you using rich FIL to your advantage?\n\nLike you actually started a fight over her getting a new car neither of you had to pay for. Just insane.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you want her to take your advice on everything and not her dads.  It might be that she grew up not wanting for anything and seemingly still doesn't but you have been with her for a long time so its not as though you haven't been aware of it.\n\nIf he is willing to fund stuff then just enjoy it as most people would be quite happy with someone buying them a new car.", "When you get married you leave your primary family behind and start your own.", "NTA\n\nCan\u2019t be wrong for saying something that is clearly true", "YTA \n\nWhen you married her, you basically accepted her for who she is which includes that she\u2019s daddy\u2019s girl. Did you guys ever discussed expectations about this dynamic before the marriage? If you didn\u2019t then than that\u2019s something you will have to deal with and name calling her will not solve your issues. Seek a marriage counselor to help mediate this.", "YTA  You knew from the very beginning. Why did you think she would change? She was the only daughter of a wealthy widower. They don't come any more dependent than that! If you don't accept it, you may as well make plans to leave. Seems you have little respect for her. Sorry.", "YTA. You got mad she asked her dad what kind of laptop to get? Ridiculous. Just because you got married doesn\u2019t mean her dad isn\u2019t part of her life anymore. I agree financial decisions should be made together. She wanted the car, you said no. There was no compromise on your part at all, no conversation just a no we don\u2019t need it, so I see why she went to her dad. Now you have a new safe car that you didn\u2019t have to pay for, plus extra cash from the sold car. Sounds like you might be jealous. \n\nRegarding the house, parents typically bring the reality to situations. Maybe she liked house A and was excited but couldn\u2019t see the reality so her dads job was to make her see maybe it\u2019s not worth the money. That maybe you could get a more move in ready home, or one with a better yard, or extra bathroom. It doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love it anymore, just that maybe there\u2019s something better for the budget you have. She wasn\u2019t asking her dad for money or trying to get you to spend more, she was just listening to his advice. Her dad isn\u2019t going anywhere, and just because you grew up differently doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a horrible a person just because her dad buys her things and she trusts his opinions. You were together for 5 years when you married, you knew who she was. Edit to add- my opinion would be the same if the roles were reversed.", "Yta\n\nDon't be mean to your wife.\n\nAnd a lot of this sounds like your own insecurity. Of course she respects and takes advice from her father. And he has the money so who cares if he buys her a car.\n\nThe house thing is another separate issue. But yelling at her instead of discussing it rationally isn't going to get you anywhere.", "You are jealous of her Dad.   Sounds like bruised ego to me and you are not being grown up.", "[deleted]", "YTA. Single parents who only have one child often have a much closer relationship than other families. My daughter will still call me about things that she could easily speak to her partner about but she wants my reassurance and opinion. My daughter and I are so close we can have an entire conversation that consists of 5 words which freaks her partner out, but it is what it is. \nCalling your wife a spoilt brat, suggests you see her as childish, you should apologise.", "I don't think you're the asshole for thinking as you do. If during the argument you were both calling each other names then thats clearly an ESH and the fact that she's pretty hurt by the spoiled brat remark is probably because you hit a sore spot with that one, it can be hard to hear you partner say he thinks about you in a way you don't want/like him to, especially if he kinda has a point to it. Go get counseling stuff like this can snowball into much bigger issues.", "[removed]", "If this was a man doing this with mother, this thread would be blowing up with people calling the man a mommas boy & how it gives them the \u201cick\u201d.", "NTA and I cannot fathom all the Y T A's.

She doesn't get the answer so she runs to daddy to get what she wants.\n\nJust start doing the same in respect of opinions about things, ah well I spoke to my parents and they think this so we're not going to do that anymore.  Or I spoke to my parents and they think I should spend my money on this so that's what I'm going to do. Sometimes people need a mirror reflected on them.\n\nShe clearly does not respect you, your opinion or your marriage.\n\nI would suggest marriage counselling to work through both your issues.\n\nETA if you want to have kids with her you need to get this sorted out now.", "Soft YTA. You have valid concerns, but there's a way to approach this more reasonably. First, you need to come to terms with the fact that this is the relationship your wife has with her dad. It was just them for a long time and bonds strengthened in grief are hard to shake. And that's not a bad thing. She will always have some inclination to get her dad's opinion. Learn to accept that and so long as its harmless, give her room to do that without judgement. Like with the car: it's okay that you spoke your mind about not needing the car. Your points were reasonable. But at the end of the day, if it's a no strings attached gift from her dad who WANTS to do this and there's no financial burden, is this a fight worth having? You two get a nicer family car and a father gets to do something for his child. But clearly there are other instances where the overreliance on her dad is actually harming the relationship. There is room to talk about these concerns with your wife in a way where you are compassionate and understanding of their relationship, while also recognizing that your marriage (and your voice) matters too. At the end of the day, 3's a crowd. No problem with getting his input but if your wife's entire opinion on a house she loved is a complete 180 just because her dad had an opposing thought, then surely that deserves some introspection on your wife's part. But she's less likely to be open to that if you're antagonizing her and their relationship. Did you really need to call her a spoiled brat? Probably not. At the end of the day, its not about the money, the house, or a father spoiling his daughter. They have a beautiful relationship but at times at the expense of your own. Sometimes it doesnt feel like a partnership when your voice, feelings, and what you bring to the table are superseded by her dad. Making life decisions together matter. Have this conversation with an open heart and hopefully you make meaningful progress. Good luck", "Lmao. If the roles were reversed people would call the husband a mommas boy.", "NTA\n\nShe grew up with only her father being both parents. Of course he has been the main male role in her life. However, she (and her father) needs to realise that she is a grown ass married woman now, who should put her husband in the front of her life, not her daddy. I don't think you are *jealous*, you just sound like you are fed up with always playing second fiddle to her dad.", "NTA. I\u2019m a daddy\u2019s girl but I don\u2019t consult him for every decision. If my husband had to validate everything with his mum, I would be annoyed. I like to be with someone who makes his decisions like a big boy.\n\nThat being said, is it really worth a fight with your wife if everything else goes smoothly?\n\nUnless you want kids? Because if you do, be prepared to have all your views on their education be overruled by the granddad\u2019s views.", "YTA\n\nAll of this sounds like insecurities on your part. Why the hell is it your problem how her dad spends his money on her? It's not a joint financial decision anymore if it's a gift from her dad.\n\nHer dad was able to convince her that house A was not good enough. Choosing a house and changing opinions on something is normal. What, do you want to get her to agree on buying a house she no longer likes? Or is it the fact that she values her father's opinion that you're unhappy with? Do you see how ridiculous that sounds? If you're that hung up about it try and point out things worth buying house A for instead of insulting your wife and trying to estrange her from her dad.", "YTA.  You knew you married a daddy's girl before you married her.  \n\nWould it be nice to be about you and her?  Sure.  But that isn't the relationship you have.  You are married to her and her dad.", "YTA - you knew this for the past 10 years and still decided to get hitched, it\u2019s all on you mate.", "YTA, your wife got her car and you got extra money for the house fund.

You're the one who's changed the rules, not her. She didn't deserve spoiled brat thrown at her out of the blue after 10 years of you just rolling with it.", "ESH. You should not have called her a spoiled brat. Your wife for accepting a car from her father without discussing it with you first and her father for butting in on your house hunting. This will never end. Nothing will ever be good enough for his daughter and he will continue to insert his money and opinions into your marriage until you and your wife set some boundaries and stick to them. \n\nIt\u2019s not wrong for him to want to buy her a car or other nice things but she is putting her relationship with her father over her relationship with you.", "NAH. She knows you have a lot of expertise in tech and could give her perfectly good advice about which laptop to get, but she'd rather ask her dad because she actually is a Daddy's Girl. You're never going to change that, and unfortunately you'll always be second fiddle to everything Dad says, does, and thinks.\n\nI think Dad's main motivation for giving her whatever she wants is the fact that her mother died so young and it was just the two of them until Dad remarried. Likewise, she relies on him because he was her only parent for most of her life. Again, you're never going to change the nature of their relationship, so just stop trying.\n\nAbout the only thing you can do is change how you view their relationship and react to the things he does for her and the things she asks from him. You can talk to her about it, but you probably won't get very far before you get lots of push back.", "ESH\n\n\nThe only reason I am not voting N T A, is that you knew who was when you married her.", "YTA.

You want that to stop just because she's married you? How would her father feel? He's raised his precious only daughter these many years, then you come along to ruin their relationship? You're not her father.  You're the husband.

Many gifted houses as wedding presents. That's normal for us. Your wife didn't marry into her own financial class because she loved you. She never complained that you don't receive gifts like her friends would, then you shouldn't complain that she is receiving gifts either. \n\nMoney gets passed on through generations.

We grew up completely different. She's the only child of a surgeon father. Her mother died when she was 2 and it was her and her father for most of her life. He remarried when she was 17. He's wealthy, sent her to private school, paid for her college, and when we met a decade ago he was still paying her rent, even though she had a solid job. I come from a poor family. But we both have pretty good jobs and make around the same amount of money now.\n\nShe is such a daddy's girl and it's been affecting our relationship. Anytime she wants or needs something, she goes to her dad first. And sometimes it's about things I could help with. I work in tech and back when we started dating she was starting grad school and she asked her dad \"what laptop should I get\"  I told her I actually work in the field (which she already knew) and could easily answer that and get her what she needs and she just kind of shrugged. Okay fine. These little things have happened throughout the last decade. But, there have been bigger issues recently.\nLast year, she decided she needs a new car. I disagreed. Her car is fine and she works from home and barely drives. She was adamant, though. About a month later, she tells me she's getting a new car. I told her we need to make these decisions together and we share finances and this is a major purchase. She says, \"oh, my dad is buying it. He said we can just sell mine and get some extra money.\" I told her it's kind of ridiculous to ask her dad to buy her a brand new car when she has a perfectly good one and we don't need it anyways. She got upset and said it's not that big of a deal and her dad doesn't mind and that the car \"wasn't that expensive anyways.\" She said I'm overreacting and that it's okay for her dad to do nice things for her. She got a brand new 2022 car completely paid for by her dad. And we sold her old one. \nNow, we are buying a new house. We've finally narrowed it down to two options. We were discussing it last week and my wife says \"oh I don't think house A is good my dad said he think we could do a lot better in our budget.\" Before she talked to her dad, she LOVED House A. So, I got a bit frustrated and said it didn't matter what her dad thought because this is our family's home and he won't be living there. She got angry. We started arguing. We both said mean things. I called her a spoiled brat and said she needed to grow up and she got upset and slept in the guest room and has it's been a few days and we have barely spoken.

Jealousy will lead you nowhere (some people commented resenting the laptop advice that happened 10years ago, and for this they are right : let it go). For the house though, it is quite an other story : you are buying that house together, right? You finally found something you both liked, and she is backtracking because she spoke with her father. Frustrating. You have the right to be. BUT : was dads advice good? Think about it without your resentment. Is it because there are some real problems requiring expensive renovations ? Or simply because he thinks the house is not luxurious enough? Totally different. If it is the latter, I would have a calm discussion with her, stating she loved the house\u2019s aesthetic beforehand, and ask her why it diesn\u2019t anymore (\u00ab\u00a0it just doesn\u2019t\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0dad says so\u00a0\u00bb is not an answer). And talk about savings with her as well. \n\nShe has every right to her father, you cannot be frustrated to have a good relashionship with family. But you are right about the spoiled part if she doesn\u2019t admit her privilege. People should understand the value af their privilege. And it can be frustrating. \n\nSo nobody\u2019s NTA, even if talking to her like that was not okay, your feelings of frustration are also valid. But talk calmly together if you want to built a life with her, instead of arguing or screaming. Nobody is the bad guy here, especially her father who only wants what is best for his only daughter.", "She's a brat and your a jealous insecure AH.", "I don't think it's about jealousy.

She didn't need a new car, but unless your car is like 10+ years old or has been prematurely run into the ground, no one *needs* a new car anyway. Doesn't stop people from buying a new one every 5 years or so.\n\nAnyway, cars are exorbitantly expensive right now, and this gift came with no strings attached from a father who genuinely loves her (isn't using materialism to control her). This was a gift for both of them. The money they just saved is not an insignificant amount. Most rational partners - especially fellow Millennials! - would be like \"Yes, PLEASE ask your rich parent, inflation is insane, any financial help or advice will take a lot of the stress and burden off of us.\"\n\nGenerationally speaking, we complain a lot about resource-rich boomers who refuse to help their kids. If these two both agreed to purchase a house based on her dad's clearly sound financial advice (resource 1), and her dad decided to help them buy it with no strings (resource 2), would OP be all \"ew, no, my pride, you're so spoiled\" and completely ignore an offer involving hundreds of thousands of dollars *that neither of them had to spend*? \n\nWhy does he care if she's spoiled if they BOTH clearly benefit from it?! \n\nThis is probably chump change to her dad.

Even the thing with the home, is about what FIL said about their budget and the biggest talk he\u2019s mentioned about his FIL\u2019s role in their lives has been a fight.\n\nThe biggest complaints OP has about the guy in the post is a huge just because gift because the guy is wealthy and advise on purchasing a home that is not weird at all to talk to a parent about. Not especially egregious at all.\n\nThe hints of a real issue of her deferring too much to her father in *their * life decisions might be there, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be OPs focus.

Why is she not free to gain her own money (by getting it from her father) and do it that way? \n\nIf my in-laws gave my husband a free car, I am grateful, not angry.  And more grateful that I'm keeping the money from selling my old car! \n\nHusbands don't get to say some final No, and that's the end of the topic.

It doesn't mean I'm listening to him \"more than my husband\", it means I took other opinions into account.\n\nDads can be wise and have experience.

Or maybe FIL has a habit of undermining husband to make him seem less than.\n\nThe laptop thing seems little to hang onto for so many years, but it could be an example of her regularly *dismissing* OP instead of treating him as equal. \n\nSo yes, he might be jealous of FIL then, but not because he's an AH but because his wife treats him like he's secondary to FIL. Anyone whose married knows how that doesn't work. If a MIL or FIL is negatively affecting the marriage it's almost always *their* child's fault for not setting healthy boundaries on behalf of their partner. And wife's behavior here falls in what would be an uncomfortable space for any of us in husbands shoes, constantly having his thoughts, opinions, and feelings dismissed in favor of FILs.\n\nNTA.

We were discussing it last week and my wife says \"oh I don't think house A is good my dad said he think we could do a lot better in our budget.\" Before she talked to her dad, she LOVED House A.\n\nSo, before she talked to Dad, she was on-board with her Husband.

If that convo had been more along the lines of... You're right, this doesn't make sense financially, however, my Dad is totally cool with buying it, maybe the convo goes differently. Sounds like instead, they talked over the practicality, he thought they came to a decision, she came back and made the choice anyways.

OP wants to be self reliant and responsible and develop good financial habits and not be dependent on anyone else. This is smart, and it's something they should both agree upon as a couple how they want to deal with money.

It's self-infantilizing and weird.\n\nNow OP's claims that this a repeat pattern are impossible to substantiate, but I understand the dismay, particularly if it really does happen as frequently as he claims.\n\nThere's also a lot of context missing, for example, the fact the OP seems to not care about the extra cash they could make from selling the old car would suggest that they are doing just fine financially, in which case I really get it.

I also think that the examples that OP is citing, until he got to the house, have practically nothing to do with him. She asked her dad for advice on what laptop to buy 10 years ago.

I fully understand the frustration of thinking someone has had something handed to them their entire lives, but for us we hadn\u2019t even grown up wealthy, my parents had just lived in poverty in order to prioritize our higher education (neither of them went to college and their one goal in life was to see their children graduate debt free with a college education).\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not trying to be like \u201cpoor people don\u2019t know how hard it is to be privileged!\u201d but also, it\u2019s really hard not to get defensive when people project their insecurities onto you just because of your family.

Since when should he dictate what presents she can and cannot accept\u2026", "Poor people's (and I say this as a former poor person) ridiculous sense of pride is part of what keeps you poor. \n\nI see it over and over again in my own family. They would rather watch their teeth rot out of their mouth than accept $300 to go to the dentist. \n\nNo one is up there keeping track of all the times you go hungry or go without to reward you later. Just accept whatever leg up life gives you (it doesn't happen often) and be a decent person and try to pay it forward when you can", "As a woman in IT, a little story, lol. When I was in uni, I was living with my then boyfriend. He's also in IT, we literally studied in the same group starting from college, and our neighbors knew that. Naturally, whenever someone needed tech help, they came to us, but kinda specifically to him. \n\nKnock-knock, if he gets the door, sure. I open the door, \"Oh, hey, can I talk to [him]?\", \"Yeah\", whatever. But even when he wasn't home or was away, they didn't say \"can I get your help, then?\", most of the time they asked when he will be back and said they'll come back later or for me to tell him to come by, even if that was next week.\n\nIt's worth noticing that half the time we ended up fixing the thing together, or even just me for whatever reason.\n\nCan't say I was mad mad about it, but definitely got more salty with each time after I first noticed it. I wasn't pissed that I was passed overs though, I was pissed about the reason why. More sexism, yay!", "Right, like if you have a good relationship with your parent, and especially if they have owned a home before and you have not, why on earth would you NOT consult them about buying a house??", "I really wish my parents had shared some advice before buying a house.", "Mostly just things he doesn't like and specifically the size of the house. He thinks it needs a bigger kitchen, bigger yard, and a couple more rooms in case we have \"more kids\" which we have already stated is not going to happen. We are a one and done family. My wife and I both agree on this. And the houses he recommended are all out of our budget or ridiculously large.", ">>When my wife and I were house shopping, ... But then we regrouped and discussed it just the two of us and made decisions together. I see none of that in this post happening.\n\nThat is literally what OP says happened. She got advice from her dad and no longer liked the house. Maybe her dad pointed out some expensive problems. Maybe there was something she fully overlooked the first time. But suddenly on this area people are dropping their \u201cif it\u2019s not two yes\u2019s it\u2019s a no\u201d discourse. \n\n> they talked over the practicality, he thought they came to a decision, she came back and made the choice anyways. I could be wrong, but I can see why that feels powerless and frustrating, even if the end result was fine.\n\nWhy does she need his approval for a gift from her dad? It has literally no financial impact other than them gaining financial freedom by being able to sell her old car.", "He gives 3 examples that doesn't mean there's not more.", "> He could focus on being and doing all the things for her that her dad can\u2019t, but he\u2019s rather be in competition with her ONLY living parent. \n\nI'm not sure the issue actually is the dad. he complains that she goes to her father first and foremost even if he can help. but the only example he has of that is when they had *just* started dating\n\nshe went to her husband about the car first. she only went to dad when husband shut her down\n\nshe and husband worked on finding a home together first, she only got her father's opinion after they had narrowed it down to final options\n\nand all the things he insults her with have to do with wealth, and most of the post is about money\n\nthe thing with the car especially seemed like he was angry that she didn't \"grow up\", get a taste of the \"real world\", and have to do without. he was furious that she simply side stepped arguing with him and got the car in a way he had no say over and no ability to control. he can't control how her father spends the money so he attacks their relationship and tries to make her feel guilty for wasting her father's money\n\nlike this seems very much about money and wealth and resenting her for her privilege, and that she doesn't have to do without, or struggle\n\nI don't even think her father dying would solve the problem, unless his daughter doesn't inherit anything", "Whew! Making all the points here. \n\nI think it\u2019s a lil but if both. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s jealous of the money (and by proxy, dad) because A) he doesn\u2019t have dad\u2019s money that he could to B) control her and her choices. He wants to be in a position to have money and dictate how it\u2019s used in their household. He seems jealous that her one parent was able to do more for her than both of his could do for him. That\u2019s a him problem and he should work that out. Cause he knew what it was when he married her. \n\nAlso, \u201cworking in tech\u201d could mean anything. Software engineers also work in tech, but that doesn\u2019t make them default experts on computer builds. So I don\u2019t know what he thought that would make him a de facto authority that she needed to consult WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED DATING. That\u2019s part of the reason I feel like relationship with her dad is his primary issue and the money envy came after.", "My mother didn't die when I was young, she's still very much alive, but my parents have helped my husband and I in so many ways over the years of our relationship and marriage.  He has MAJOR resentment issues because I grew up with a family that could and would support in every way possible, but he never had an issue with benefiting from that support.  Until about a year ago.  And it is now one of the biggest reasons we are divorcing.", "What? He mentioned \"ancient history\" to show that is has been a problem for a long time. He then DID mention current affairs to follow up with that. Did....did you not even read the post?", "Advice about a laptop? \n\nThat isn't a \"do you think I should consider moving to X city for job opportunities\" kind of thing.\n\nIt's a laptop.", "How is receiving a car as a gift then selling the car you own for extra money a \"bad financial idea\". They ended up with a better car and more money towards them", "> it was a bad financial idea.\n\nBecause it's NOT a bad financial decision. They end up with a new car AND the cash from selling the old one."]}
