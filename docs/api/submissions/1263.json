They hired me knowing I'm still in school and it seems they will be flexible with the remainder of my studies. I'm working through my notice at the school and begin my new job next week. However, my mom is not at all supportive. During my interviews, she begged me to reconsider many times. She says it's too similar to bartending (because the job involves meeting new people, although this is strictly a B2B and not serving drunk people, so to me, it is different enough, right?)

My mom and her sisters rotate on paying the whole bill, and since I've been struggling financially I'm not part of the rotation. This last saturday, my mom announced that since I have this new cushy job, I will be paying the bill this time. She knows I haven't started this job and still only make $200/week. I offered to pay after I get my first pay check instead but that wasn't good enough. I checked my bank account and didn't have enough to cover the bill, so I tried not to cry, told everyone I couldn't pay, and left the rest of my food on the table and left. I felt terrible on the way home but I don't know what else I could have done. She hasn't contacted me since until earlier today, telling me I need to be more respectful and pay it forward after she's been giving me so much money, especially after going and getting a job that will leave me just as burnt out as before.

Also I'm not sure what the job is but it's your life and having a job, especially one that pays well should be a source of pride, not snide comments. She should have ASKED if you could afford to pay, instead of humiliating you. Hopefully your aunts will be more understanding. I hope you can resolve this with your mum as clearly you have a good relationship with her usually (especially as she helps you financially). Suggest you pay for the first lunch you have after you get your first pay check.", "NTA your mom was out of line for deciding that you wound pay without talking to you. That was seriously passive aggressive on her part. Now, it\u2019s possible your mom is right about this job being a bad choice for you, I don\u2019t know BUT it\u2019s YOUR decision.

She should have asked you first, but I suspect her motive was to embarrass you."]}
