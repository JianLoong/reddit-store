That said, if I were in a her position I would be having intense anxiety to have to keep going back to that kind of environment (her dad). When I was younger I stayed with my grandparents once a year or so and they were sexist and often used their religion to justify treating me like shit. \nI feel like OP is concerned for her daughter's well-being but clearly knows the implications of giving her advice that could make her father look bad. For me though, if filming a family member treating me like shit would have got me out of that situation I feel confident I wouldn't think twice and it would have prevented a lot of stress and anxiety. Cameras have vindicated many victims who would have otherwise been overlooked, so if OPs daughter is being mistreated I honestly can understand her wanting evidence that can aid in getting her out of a situation that is not good for her.\nOP is NTA.

Just the request itself leans toward parental alienation. A GAL will talk with your daughter and she can TELL them how her father behaves.   \n\n\nI do agree with you trying to get full custody though. Just go about in a way that protects your daughter as much as possible. Ideally you don't want her to hate her father, although I think the relationship will probably go that way depending on how he behaves during the custody dispute.", "Indeterminate. If your daughter is being verbally abused or otherwise abused, it is within your daughter's rights of self-protection to record. Recording abuse is standard advice from professionals (but check local laws). You shouldn't push her to do it for your goals, but you can tell her it's an option for her own protection and sanity. If she does it, they'll be her recordings and it should be up to her what to do with them (unless there's physical abuse, or if whatever else is on there is so bad you have to get involved for her immediate safety).
