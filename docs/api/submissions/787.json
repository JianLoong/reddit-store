I have 3 years of work experience though but in entry level jobs, and finished half of college.\n\nI never committed to her outright- I told her I did not wish to be exclusive. I called her my girlfriend over text once but neither of us was clear with our intentions. I never explicitly committed to her. \n\nI acknowledge that I broke the girl code- but her friend was very good looking and I was thinking with my you-know-what.\n\nI also accused her of only caring about herself- and she agreed outright.

She was being judgy and critical of my entire life and said I was screwing over my parents - I was 24 at the time.\n\nThe funny thing is- she asked me to hook up a month later after all that as if she never said all of that.\n\nI still think she took things way too far.
