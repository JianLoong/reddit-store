Although I'm pretty sure he'll be able to tell it's me because this is a super unique experience, but I'm banking on him not seeing this.\n\nMy husband, Ethan (27m) and I (27f) got married a year ago. We had been dating since we were 23 and got married last year. We knew that we wanted to have a family, and want multiple kids. So, a few months after we got married we started trying for our first baby. I got pregnant, and I'm about 24wks along today!!\n\nAt my 20wk appointment, they asked if we wanted to know the gender. We wanted to know so we could start planning names ahead of time. Turns out, it's a girl! I was overjoyed. The next day, we starting talking names and Ethan said that he already knew the PERFECT name for a girl- Zoe.\n\nHere is where the issue begins: Zoe is the name of my husband's cat that passed away when we first started dating. Not only that, but the cat was a gift from an ex-girlfriend that they intended on taking care of together. When they broke up, they had \"joint custody\" until she died.\n\nI gently let him know that I don't really want to name our daughter after his dead cat. He told me to think about it- reasoning that it fit our criteria (short names, bully-proof, cute, unique so that nobody else in her class will have it, but not so unique that people won't know how to pronounce it,) and he considered cat-Zoe like a daughter to him. I jokingly responded, \"So you want to name our baby after your kid from your last marriage?\"\n\nHe didn't laugh. Instead, he got defensive. He said it wasn't like that. I said that I didn't really like the idea of naming our daughter after something that he associated with his last relationship. He started getting teary-eyed, presumably because he was thinking about his dead pet. He then responded with \"Fine, it's *your* baby. Name it whatever you want.\"\n\nSince then I've been here and there suggesting names I see elsewhere, and every time he responds with \"I don't care. Do what you want.\"\n\nI can't help but feel like the AH; maybe I'm being too stubborn? I do like the name Zoe, it's just that I don't think I'd be able to move past the history behind it.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: You guys get bonus points if you suggest good baby names!!!\n\nEDIT 2: for everyone suggesting the name Chloe instead, that\u2019s the name of my estranged sister that\u2019s in jail hahaha so I\u2019m gonna have to say no to that one !!!", "created_utc": 1703627359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18rj82c/aita_for_not_wanting_to_name_our_baby_after_my/", "score": 1108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is naming another living being \u201cZoe\u201d going to make him miss his cat less? I doubt it.  Maybe you could find a stuffed animal version that looks like Zoe the cat and give it to the baby as a gift one day. Or get a pet portrait of Zoe commissioned.

Or a name where someone won't come up with a nickname that either you or the child might hate. We ultimately named our daughter Cecilia, because we both loved the name and the song.

You are NOT the AH, and don't try to trick yourself into thinking you are to accommodate his feelings.  My husband was widowed before we married and they had a myriad of pets.

I know a lot of it was guilt from him because the cat died suddenly from a still uncertain health issue.

I wasn't comfortable with it because of it's origin and how recently cat died.  Agreed to reconsider it if we have a 3rd child of proper gender for it.

Do what you want.\"\n\nYour husband is super childish and manipulative. He refuses to have a civil, adult conversation about something that is important to both of you; what to name your child. I hope he does see this and reads all the comments. Bottom line, he doesn't get his way because this isn't just HIS child. It takes two yesses to come to a decision. Stick to your no vote.

Although I'm pretty sure he'll be able to tell it's me because this is a super unique experience, but I'm banking on him not seeing this.\n\nMy husband, Ethan (27m) and I (27f) got married a year ago. We had been dating since we were 23 and got married last year. We knew that we wanted to have a family, and want multiple kids. So, a few months after we got married we started trying for our first baby. I got pregnant, and I'm about 24wks along today!!\n\nAt my 20wk appointment, they asked if we wanted to know the gender. We wanted to know so we could start planning names ahead of time. Turns out, it's a girl! I was overjoyed. The next day, we starting talking names and Ethan said that he already knew the PERFECT name for a girl- Zoe.\n\nHere is where the issue begins: Zoe is the name of my husband's cat that passed away when we first started dating. Not only that, but the cat was a gift from an ex-girlfriend that they intended on taking care of together. When they broke up, they had \"joint custody\" until she died.\n\nI gently let him know that I don't really want to name our daughter after his dead cat. He told me to think about it- reasoning that it fit our criteria (short names, bully-proof, cute, unique so that nobody else in her class will have it, but not so unique that people won't know how to pronounce it,) and he considered cat-Zoe like a daughter to him. I jokingly responded, \"So you want to name our baby after your kid from your last marriage?\"\n\nHe didn't laugh. Instead, he got defensive. He said it wasn't like that. I said that I didn't really like the idea of naming our daughter after something that he associated with his last relationship. He started getting teary-eyed, presumably because he was thinking about his dead pet. He then responded with \"Fine, it's *your* baby. Name it whatever you want.\"\n\nSince then I've been here and there suggesting names I see elsewhere, and every time he responds with \"I don't care. Do what you want.\"\n\nI can't help but feel like the AH; maybe I'm being too stubborn? I do like the name Zoe, it's just that I don't think I'd be able to move past the history behind it.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Once you give that name to an actual baby it will only be about the baby because you\u2019ll love her so much.

If you think it\u2019s more tied up with his ex, he\u2019s probably not the right person to be having a baby with. Make sure to isolate why he\u2019s feeling the way he is.

I totally get what you mean and it's quite wrong of him to try and get you to name your daughter his dead pet's name. I had a situation that in time I got over it but years ago we went and adopted a dog. I'm going through the shelter basically interviewing different dogs. And I finally got the one that seemed really nice, was partially trained, knew commands, and Iis the real sweetheart. Then I asked them the dog's name. Let's say the dog's name was Samantha. It was a person's name just obviously a different name. Well Samantha happened to be my ex-boyfriend's ex-girlfriend's name, who he'd been quite involved with and hung up on. And in the end I found out he was cheating with her the entire time he was seeing me pretty much. Hence he was an ex at that point. We were looking to adopt a dog probably about 2 months or so after we've broken up. Well Samantha was too great to pass up so we adopted her it was difficult at first getting used to calling her that name that I heard so much from my ex. But eventually I was okay and able to push the ex and his ex girlfriend out of my mind. Samantha was a great dog. She lived a very long and happy life with us. But if I ever had a kid I would never have named them Samantha even if my husband had insisted. I loved my dog but because of the association with my ex-boyfriend the name would never be a contender. I doubt your boyfriend will ever see the other point of view in all of this but yes don't name your kid Zoe. If you can compromise you can always use that as a middle name but that's about as far as I would go. But if he's going to be stupid about it take a name tell him the baby's name and if he wants to say in it great but Zoe's off the table and if he has anything else you'd like to suggest you're all ears.", "NTA\n\nI would have loved to be able to name my baby after my dog that passed many many years before, but that name stays with my dog.
