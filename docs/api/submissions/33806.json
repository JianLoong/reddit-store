Although I'm pretty sure he'll be able to tell it's me because this is a super unique experience, but I'm banking on him not seeing this.\n\nMy husband, Ethan (27m) and I (27f) got married a year ago. We had been dating since we were 23 and got married last year. We knew that we wanted to have a family, and want multiple kids. So, a few months after we got married we started trying for our first baby. I got pregnant, and I'm about 24wks along today!!\n\nAt my 20wk appointment, they asked if we wanted to know the gender. We wanted to know so we could start planning names ahead of time. Turns out, it's a girl! I was overjoyed. The next day, we starting talking names and Ethan said that he already knew the PERFECT name for a girl- Zoe.\n\nHere is where the issue begins: Zoe is the name of my husband's cat that passed away when we first started dating. Not only that, but the cat was a gift from an ex-girlfriend that they intended on taking care of together. When they broke up, they had \"joint custody\" until she died.\n\nI gently let him know that I don't really want to name our daughter after his dead cat. He told me to think about it- reasoning that it fit our criteria (short names, bully-proof, cute, unique so that nobody else in her class will have it, but not so unique that people won't know how to pronounce it,) and he considered cat-Zoe like a daughter to him. I jokingly responded, \"So you want to name our baby after your kid from your last marriage?\"\n\nHe didn't laugh. Instead, he got defensive. He said it wasn't like that. I said that I didn't really like the idea of naming our daughter after something that he associated with his last relationship. He started getting teary-eyed, presumably because he was thinking about his dead pet. He then responded with \"Fine, it's *your* baby. Name it whatever you want.\"\n\nSince then I've been here and there suggesting names I see elsewhere, and every time he responds with \"I don't care. Do what you want.\"\n\nI can't help but feel like the AH; maybe I'm being too stubborn? I do like the name Zoe, it's just that I don't think I'd be able to move past the history behind it.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: You guys get bonus points if you suggest good baby names!!!", "created_utc": 1703627359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18rj82c/aita_for_not_wanting_to_name_our_baby_after_my/", "score": 434, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe you could find a stuffed animal version that looks like Zoe the cat and give it to the baby as a gift one day. Or get a pet portrait of Zoe commissioned.

Or a name where someone won't come up with a nickname that either you or the child might hate. We ultimately named our daughter Cecilia, because we both loved the name and the song.

I wasn't comfortable with it because of it's origin and how recently cat died.  Agreed to reconsider it if we have a 3rd child of proper gender for it.

I hope he does see this and reads all the comments. Bottom line, he doesn't get his way because this isn't just HIS child. It takes two yesses to come to a decision. Stick to your no vote.

Using a name that he chose with his ex is just not an option because his ex is not the one he is building a family with. Yes he still likes the name, it's cute, but it's not ok for him to have an attitude about it. \n\nIt's not that the name is \"bad\" or ugly. It's that it's not a choice the two of you are making together. And naming a child should be a two yes one no situation. \n\nI had boys names I loved from my previous pregnancies. When I got pregnant with my son, I suggested those names to my new husband because I still loved them. He didn't, that was fine. And we chose the perfect name for him. \n\nIt makes sense that you don't want to bring a past relationship into your family that way. His reaction does not make sense.", "OMG. No you are not the AH. I have a lot of dead pets. Rupert, Sadie, Bowie, TyTy, Star, Shadow and Smokey to name some.   \nNone of them are going to be future baby names because I'm not NUTS. Well, Sadie could be an okay name. But no. A child is going to have an original name that isn't the same name as a dead pet. Can you imagine being that poor kid? \"How did I get my name?\" \"Oh, your dad had a cat he really loved named Zoe and she died, so you're carrying on her legacy!\"   \nSuch baloney. Can you curse in this forum? Bulllllllshhhhht.  \nI even read this to my husband because I was going \"OMG OMG\" out loud, and he laughed and he was like, \"I would have been okay naming a kid Bowie but I'd never be able to look him in the eyes and tell him how we came up with his name!\"   \nSo you get two NTA's from us and your husband gets a big \"You're the AH here\" from us both.

Although I'm pretty sure he'll be able to tell it's me because this is a super unique experience, but I'm banking on him not seeing this.\n\nMy husband, Ethan (27m) and I (27f) got married a year ago. We had been dating since we were 23 and got married last year. We knew that we wanted to have a family, and want multiple kids. So, a few months after we got married we started trying for our first baby. I got pregnant, and I'm about 24wks along today!!\n\nAt my 20wk appointment, they asked if we wanted to know the gender. We wanted to know so we could start planning names ahead of time. Turns out, it's a girl! I was overjoyed. The next day, we starting talking names and Ethan said that he already knew the PERFECT name for a girl- Zoe.\n\nHere is where the issue begins: Zoe is the name of my husband's cat that passed away when we first started dating. Not only that, but the cat was a gift from an ex-girlfriend that they intended on taking care of together. When they broke up, they had \"joint custody\" until she died.\n\nI gently let him know that I don't really want to name our daughter after his dead cat. He told me to think about it- reasoning that it fit our criteria (short names, bully-proof, cute, unique so that nobody else in her class will have it, but not so unique that people won't know how to pronounce it,) and he considered cat-Zoe like a daughter to him. I jokingly responded, \"So you want to name our baby after your kid from your last marriage?\"\n\nHe didn't laugh. Instead, he got defensive. He said it wasn't like that. I said that I didn't really like the idea of naming our daughter after something that he associated with his last relationship. He started getting teary-eyed, presumably because he was thinking about his dead pet. He then responded with \"Fine, it's *your* baby. Name it whatever you want.\"\n\nSince then I've been here and there suggesting names I see elsewhere, and every time he responds with \"I don't care. Do what you want.\"\n\nI can't help but feel like the AH; maybe I'm being too stubborn? I do like the name Zoe, it's just that I don't think I'd be able to move past the history behind it.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA: It's really silly to name a child after a pet's name. He is being selfish and unreasonable.", "NTA. Zoe might not be super popular buts it's been popular enough your likely to have several in her class. And as soon as you think no one else will pick this name then boom its everywhere. I also thought i picked a unique name for daughter. Then several more hVe popped up as soon as she started school. As for easy to say, never underestimate people ability to screw even the simplest of names up. My daughters name starts with a  E, you wouldn't believe the number of people who switch that with an A.", "NTA.  I have multiple ideas here.\n\n1) Call his bluff and pick something terrible\n\n2) Call his bluff and pick something normal\n\nLet him know that it's important to him that you guys do this together, rather than either one of you getting stuck on names that the other person doesn't like; it's not fair of him to hold this one name over you when you don't want to name her that.  Baby names fall under a rule: Two yes, one no, and the one no (or two yes) doesn't count if it's one parent refusing to budge until they get their way.\n\n(Also, I'd recommend not letting him fill out the birth certificate)", "YTA. Once you give that name to an actual baby it will only be about the baby because you\u2019ll love her so much. In fact, the associations he has with that name will be likely rebranded and lost while he develops an entire world of memories with your daughter. It is clearly the name he\u2019s always wanted to use. So for those reasons I would consider it.\nThat said, he is reacting badly. Perhaps he doesn\u2019t like that you accused him of choosing it based on his cat with his ex. Who knows. Clearly, though, loves that name more and hasn\u2019t fulfilled his wish to have a kid with that name.", "As someone who would love to use my cat\u2019s name as a middle name if I ever had a baby, I understand the level of Iove he has for his cat. If it\u2019s truly just about the cat, then I think you can both approach this differently. If you think it\u2019s more tied up with his ex, he\u2019s probably not the right person to be having a baby with. Make sure to isolate why he\u2019s feeling the way he is. He did overreact once he verbally stomped his feet which is cause for concern as a soon-to-be father. \n\nIs it about the cat or the ex for him? Because you can love a cat and be totally separated and out of love with an ex. \n\nAt the end of the day, it has to be two yes.
