{"id": 13803, "submission_id": "129kgcc", "title": "AITA for not wanting to have an adult slumber party?", "selftext": "My wife(32F) and I(37M) are friends with another married couple, that is much younger than us (\\~10-15 years). I am not a fan of either of them, but we both have young children, and my wife has become close with the other wife. The husband is on his phone 24/7, and we don't seem to have much in common, but I do my best to put on a friendly face because I think it's important for my young child to have time around other toddlers.\n\nEvery time they come to our house, it seems to turn into an all-day visit, I'm talking like 6-8 hours. I eventually get worn down by the other wife, she annoys me. She never stops talking, she is completely anti-vax for her child, and constantly says just incredibly stupid things, such as yesterday when she went on for \\~5 minutes about how Michelle Obama might actually be a man, she's even 'seen a picture where it looks like she has a penis'. I stay out of most of the conversation because I'm afraid that if I do join in, I won't be able to refrain from being very blunt. \n\nYesterday, as we're watching the kids play in a little inflatable pool on the front lawn, I'm not really listening to the conversation but my wife taps me and asks, 'what do you think about having them stay over some night in the future?'. I said sure but made a mental note to talk to my wife later about it. These people have their own home, why would they sleep at mine unless they had too much to drink? (We were not drinking). Around an hour later, I realize through the conversation they're having that a decision has been made for them so stay over, tonight. It immediately made my blood boil that my wife made this decision, knowing that I do not like this couple (it's been discussed), and without really asking me about it, just asking me about a 'future' slumber party.\n\nFor the next 3-4 hours I was near everyone but was not really a part of any conversation, I was pissed off. I took my baby upstairs around 730 PM to try and get her to sleep, because it was too loud downstairs. My wife came up and I immediately fired off on her, and told her she was a f\\*%#ing asshole for inviting 2 adults I can't stand to sleep over at my house, and without discussing it with me first. We argued a little and she went back downstairs.\n\nAfter getting the baby to sleep, I walked downstairs and noticed they were packing up their stuff. No one said a word to me, and it was maybe the most awkward 30 seconds of my life, there was tension in the room. After they left, my wife told me that she had come downstairs and told them that I did not want them to stay the night.\n\nMy wife and I argued after they left, she thinks she did nothing wrong and I can't believe she made me look like such an asshole, and how awkward it will be when I have to see these people again.

Don't have them come over.\n\nDoes your wife not care that their child could give your child measles?", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t tell her to evict them, right? You were just relaying that in the future you should be consulted, which was a 100% reasonable request. Seems like your wife wanted to embarrass you and succeeded but she created the awkward situation entirely all on her own.\n\nNot for nothing but I too could only tolerate these people in small doses.", "ESH. Next time your wife presents you with a nutty idea, ask more questions.", "NTA for not having them stay. But definitely TA for cussing at your wife and calling her names.", "ESH. You did technically agree to a vague question with a definite answer so if they talked immediately after and they were like \u201cwhat about tonight?\u201d \u201cSure works great for me\u201d \u201cawesome, husband just said sure so he\u2019s okay with it\u201d given that she can\u2019t read your mind, your \u201csure\u201d definitely was approval here and \u201ctonight\u201d I guess technically is \u201csome night in the future\u201d, but it was not fair for her to do, nor was it mature to go back downstairs and tell them the way she did \n\nYour fault is in how you unloaded on her when she went upstairs. Yes I get you were pissed. Yes I get you had intentions to further discuss this later. But she didn\u2019t know that, you said \u201csure\u201d, and then immediately unloaded on her a few hours later for something you did actually agree to. I can see why that would really hurt her, too. You both need to sit down, and talk like adults.", "YTA because you let this \"friendship\" in your house at the first place. If your wife is staying home, than she needs socializing within your own league. These people are definitely not yours. So, you just cannot reject people she finds to socialize without providing more appropriate choices.", "Oh yikes. Okay, I can sympathize with you with regards to your irritation to this other couple, I would hope most reasonable people can. I can sympathize with your anger that she went ahead and made plans with these people without discussing it with you, I\u2019d be mad too. I\u2019d also be humiliated and perplexed by the fact that your wife immediately went back downstairs and told them to leave straight away, because I wouldn\u2019t have been indecent in my response to the news that these plans were in fact already in place without my input. That\u2019s no way to treat people, or speak to anyone. You\u2019ve known this since elementary school. Next time, tell her you\u2019re rather upset because you weren\u2019t consulted and not that it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault, but these particular people drive you nuts and you don\u2019t want to be around them. Then clarify that clearly since plans have been made, we\u2019re going through with them, but that does not mean that this is an okay situation and it really can\u2019t happen again. Your wife should have talked to you about this and expressed her full intention, and you should have treated her with decency and respect. ESH.", "YTA - You were consulted and you said sure! Then you yell at your wife and call her nasty name for not consulting you. Maybe she shouldn't have told your friends to leave but i can understand why she did.", "YTA\n\nIf you didn't want them to stay or wanted to discuss it later, then that's what you should have said when your wife asked. It also sounds like you had plenty of opportunity to handle it more tactfully (3 - 4 hours is a long enough time to think up an excuse).\n\nTaking a pop at your wife for your failure to communicate is an AH move.\n\nThat said, you both need to work on your communication. \nI'd wager wife probably had it in mind for them to stay that evening already and asked you in a really noncommittal way on purpose so that you wouldn't outright reject it.", "Your wife asked you about a situation and you said sure. You 'made a mental note to talk to her about it later,' but did you? Did you have the conversation with your wife beforehand about how that couple does not make you comfortable with the racist speech and anti-vax stance? Did you talk with your wife and tell her that you didn't want them staying at your house overnight? Because you should have had those conversations before you got into an argument with her in front of that couple.   \n\n\nYou agreed that they could stay, granted it was in the moment, and when she gave them the permission she thought she had, you made her look like the bad guy, then you called her a 'fucking asshole' and blamed her for making you look badly when it was you whom didn't follow through on your 'mental note to talk to her later.'   \n\n\nYTA.", "YTA, you agreed to a question about them staying over, rather than ask for clarification or more details. Then you explode unprovoked on your wife, and when she tells people they need to leave and gets them out of \u201cYour House\u201d you then go even further and are pissed that she didn\u2019t cover for your temper tantrum and outburst because poor you, you had to endure an awkward exit?", "YTA \nAnd you owe her a big apology. Points\n\n she asked you if its ok? You said sure if you have a problem you should have said we talk about it later.\n\nShe then had to back from the offer you said sure and break her pride .. she had to show Infront of guests that she has no say in her home .... Her pride is shattered and its your fault. Remember she has the same rights and authority as you in the house.\n\nShe respected you even you were the asshole. \n\nYou have a golden woman sir and you should appreciate her .\n\nSuggestion : apologies and make it up to her with dinner out .", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But he said sure and then didn't like that his wife proceeded with his approval.", "She asked about them staying at some point in the future, not that night. That sort of thing needs to be planned and discussed ahead of time when prospective visitors aren't there.", "A golden woman doesn\u2019t hang out with racist antivaxxers.", "That has zero to do with my comment.", "According to the OP the wife asked \u201cin the future.\u201d Had she said \u201ctonight\u201d he probably would not have consented so quickly. Why didn\u2019t she ask about tonight? Why ask vaguely?", "She said sometime, she didn't ask for that specific day. I assume he was waiting until they left to talk to her about it when she asked initially. Who asks in front of other people if they can stay the night? Children. It was rude and disrespectful of her to ask in front of them, then make plans for that to happen that day, when she knows he doesn't care for them. That's ridiculous. \n\nHe shouldn't have cursed at her, the discussion should have been calm and rationale. So he's TA for that part. She's TA for pulling that shit in front of people though.", "NTA Yeah she asked about the possibility of a sleepover at a future date, then decided that future date was a couple of hours later.\n\nHe agreed not to cause a scene and made a note to talk about it later to why it wasn\u2019t something he wanted to happen and then suddenly it\u2019s happening the same day they brought up the possibility.\n\nI doubt she wanted him to give the real answer that she knew he wanted to give so he was pressure into accepting in the heat of the moment. What else was he supposed to say \u201cNo I don\u2019t want these people sleeping in my house, they\u2019re grown adults, ones a racist anti-vaxxer the others glued to his phone and is totally ignorant.", "Ok. You're right. I must not have seen that wife changed the dynamic. Still, OP said sure, wife operated under known circumstances and then he calls her names when she went with what she knew. Wife should have waited, surely, but didn't deserve what she got when she didn't know she was wronging the husband. OP could have said 'can we talk about it later / after they're gone' instead of just giving permission for something he didn't want to happen in the first place.", "OP said they are friends because of the kids. Her behaviour towards her husband was very good. Im not defending the couple at all but when someone behaves good we have to remember.\n\nAre the couple shit? absolutely but in this instance her reactions are very good", "Probably because the tonight thing hadn't been decided yet at that point. It was probably \"my husband and I were thinking it'd be great to have you guys stay over to do [blah blah blah] the next time you're here!\" \"Well honestly we're free to do [blah blah blah] tomorrow. We don't really have any plans.\" \"That's perfect! You should stay tonight then!\"\n\nBut given the husband actively hated them and never wanted them to stay over, why would he say \"sure\" instead of \"let's talk about it later\"?", "> Who asks in front of other people if they can stay the night? Children. It was rude and disrespectful of her to ask in front of them, then make plans for that to happen that day, when she knows he doesn't care for them.\n\nAre you saying that the wife shouldn't have a say in who stays in her own house? That she didn't ask permission from her husband correctly and respectfully enough? That's scary. \n\nBut again, it's super easy to say \"we'll figure it out later.\" And again, op says he wasn't consulted when he clearly was.", "I disagree. Seems like the golden woman tried to embarrass her husband by announcing he didn\u2019t want them to stay. He doesn\u2019t say he asked her to do that. It seems like he was going to bite the bullet and honor his offhand consent to the sleepover, regardless of his distaste.", "I think \u201cCan they say over sometime in the indeterminate future?\u201d and \u201cCan they stay over tonight?\u201d are very very different questions likely to elicit different answers.", "What she could have said? After he went back on his word... \n\nHoney can they stay???\n\nsure \n\nok honey they are staying . \n\nWtf is wrong with you, don't you know i absolutely hate them . I don't want them in my house .....", "I agree but op's answer was still \"no, not ever\" so I don't see how that changes this particular situation.", "He doesn\u2019t say he asked her to throw them out. It reads to me like he resigned himself that it was going to happen anyway since he was surprised to see them leaving.", "The couple were present, if perhaps out of earshot. I can understand not wanting to discuss it in depth when you genuine believe it can wait for a future time when you\u2019re alone together. Remember the wife knows he doesn\u2019t like them.", "Well let's agree to disagree. I think if my wife ask me something i must be listening to her specially if its something that is important to me.\n\nI think if im tolerating their existence i should hold on blowing up on my wife . And talk about it later after they are gone\n\nI actually do this with my wife of 7 years.\n\nOP needs to communicate better. Don't want something say no", "Yes. My point is not that he should have talked against the couple then, I'm saying he should have said \"let's talk about it later.\" Or even \"We'll figure it out later\" if they were right there. Or even just suddenly having to change the subject.\n\nThe op gave *false* information and false information is more dangerous than no information. He's now mad that his wife went off of what he actually told her. That's an asshole move.", "Yeah. Maybe he could responded better. But I just think his wife should not have ambushed him that way, by \u201casking\u201d him in the couple\u2019s presence. That is not fair. She put him a very awkward position, probably an intentional manipulation."]}
