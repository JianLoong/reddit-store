I am not a fan of either of them, but we both have young children, and my wife has become close with the other wife. The husband is on his phone 24/7, and we don't seem to have much in common, but I do my best to put on a friendly face because I think it's important for my young child to have time around other toddlers.\n\nEvery time they come to our house, it seems to turn into an all-day visit, I'm talking like 6-8 hours. I eventually get worn down by the other wife, she annoys me. She never stops talking, she is completely anti-vax for her child, and constantly says just incredibly stupid things, such as yesterday when she went on for \\~5 minutes about how Michelle Obama might actually be a man, she's even 'seen a picture where it looks like she has a penis'. I stay out of most of the conversation because I'm afraid that if I do join in, I won't be able to refrain from being very blunt. \n\nYesterday, as we're watching the kids play in a little inflatable pool on the front lawn, I'm not really listening to the conversation but my wife taps me and asks, 'what do you think about having them stay over some night in the future?'. I said sure but made a mental note to talk to my wife later about it. These people have their own home, why would they sleep at mine unless they had too much to drink? (We were not drinking). Around an hour later, I realize through the conversation they're having that a decision has been made for them so stay over, tonight. It immediately made my blood boil that my wife made this decision, knowing that I do not like this couple (it's been discussed), and without really asking me about it, just asking me about a 'future' slumber party.\n\nFor the next 3-4 hours I was near everyone but was not really a part of any conversation, I was pissed off. I took my baby upstairs around 730 PM to try and get her to sleep, because it was too loud downstairs. My wife came up and I immediately fired off on her, and told her she was a f\\*%#ing asshole for inviting 2 adults I can't stand to sleep over at my house, and without discussing it with me first. We argued a little and she went back downstairs.\n\nAfter getting the baby to sleep, I walked downstairs and noticed they were packing up their stuff. No one said a word to me, and it was maybe the most awkward 30 seconds of my life, there was tension in the room. After they left, my wife told me that she had come downstairs and told them that I did not want them to stay the night.\n\nMy wife and I argued after they left, she thinks she did nothing wrong and I can't believe she made me look like such an asshole, and how awkward it will be when I have to see these people again.

You're right. I must not have seen that wife changed the dynamic. Still, OP said sure, wife operated under known circumstances and then he calls her names when she went with what she knew. Wife should have waited, surely, but didn't deserve what she got when she didn't know she was wronging the husband. OP could have said 'can we talk about it later / after they're gone' instead of just giving permission for something he didn't want to happen in the first place.", "OP said they are friends because of the kids.

Your wife should have talked to you in private first. She made an offer that should have never been extended, then blamed you for defending your own boundaries that she was not respectful of.

Need more info on that.  I think you could have handled the conversation with your wife better - it sounds like your emotions were out of control.  The real problem here is that your wife has found what she considers to be an ideal friend couple.  She is close with the wife, the kids are the same age so she can hang out with her friend without childcare being an issue.  My guess is that marriage and having kids has probably interfered with some of her longstanding friendships.  She sees this couple as being a perfect way to manage motherhood and maintain a social life.

But that doesn't fit with his behavior that evening. \n\nIf anything it seems scary controlling imho. He hates the guests, but agrees to theoretically letting them stay over, all while planning on forbidding it later (let's be real, the discussion later would have been forbidding it). He curses out his wife for believing his fib when he thinks that the guests can't hear, then gets mad when she tells them that the husband doesn't want them there because he loses face. Then he lies to us about how he wasn't consulted (not that he misunderstood or that he was annoyed his wife suggested it that night, he said he wasn't consulted).\n\nHe has some really scary behavior going on and it seems to be a lot about him looking like the good guy while controlling everything.", "I hope she consults you in private and not in a manner that forces you to look like an asshole in front of guests.", "I think are being pretty hard on a guy who is willingly spending time with people he actively dislikes to please his wife and kid.

She may have made a slight breach of etiquette. He cursed out the mother of his child. One of those things is a lot worse than the other.", "Could she have done it better? Sure! But op directly lied, then called her as asshole for believing his lie. In terms of fault it's 95% op 5% wife. (Maybe 90/10) So op is soundly an asshole, especially given that he tried to lie to us, claiming his wife didn't consult him (when she did) and calling his wife horrible names (where likely the guests could hear it of you want to focus on how'd there's company over).\n\nI don't see how anyone can be do worried about offending guests they hate that they're forced to agree to a sleepover, but not worried enough that they can tell at their wife and call her an asshole while the guests are still in the house.", "Tell me what I got wrong, then. I certainly have my opinion but I'll listen to you and if you have a point I'll reconsider. \n\nTbh I would agree with e.s.h. if op had just been pissed about it being that night instead of the vague time in the future (he shouldn't have said sure, but in the future doesn't imply tonight). But it's clear he was basically just lying. Then he blamed his wife for believing him. He also slipped into calling it his house and his baby. \n\nI also have very little patience for people who curse out and insult their spouses. It's one thing if there is a life threatening situation, but generally speaking,  I find that behavior unacceptable, bordering on abusive. It's such a breakdown of the team dynamic that it's something that I find nearly inexcusable. Especially given that op doesn't seem to regret it. His only concern at the end is how he looks to these people he hates. That's really weird to me on several levels. It's fine to hate them, it's fine to worry about how you look to your friends, it's weird to worry about how you look to people you hate more than the argument with your spouse.", "You assume profanity is not part of how they usually speak to each other.
