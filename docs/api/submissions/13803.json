I am not a fan of either of them, but we both have young children, and my wife has become close with the other wife. The husband is on his phone 24/7, and we don't seem to have much in common, but I do my best to put on a friendly face because I think it's important for my young child to have time around other toddlers.\n\nEvery time they come to our house, it seems to turn into an all-day visit, I'm talking like 6-8 hours. I eventually get worn down by the other wife, she annoys me. She never stops talking, she is completely anti-vax for her child, and constantly says just incredibly stupid things, such as yesterday when she went on for \\~5 minutes about how Michelle Obama might actually be a man, she's even 'seen a picture where it looks like she has a penis'. I stay out of most of the conversation because I'm afraid that if I do join in, I won't be able to refrain from being very blunt. \n\nYesterday, as we're watching the kids play in a little inflatable pool on the front lawn, I'm not really listening to the conversation but my wife taps me and asks, 'what do you think about having them stay over some night in the future?'. I said sure but made a mental note to talk to my wife later about it. These people have their own home, why would they sleep at mine unless they had too much to drink? (We were not drinking). Around an hour later, I realize through the conversation they're having that a decision has been made for them so stay over, tonight. It immediately made my blood boil that my wife made this decision, knowing that I do not like this couple (it's been discussed), and without really asking me about it, just asking me about a 'future' slumber party.\n\nFor the next 3-4 hours I was near everyone but was not really a part of any conversation, I was pissed off. I took my baby upstairs around 730 PM to try and get her to sleep, because it was too loud downstairs. My wife came up and I immediately fired off on her, and told her she was a f\\*%#ing asshole for inviting 2 adults I can't stand to sleep over at my house, and without discussing it with me first. We argued a little and she went back downstairs.\n\nAfter getting the baby to sleep, I walked downstairs and noticed they were packing up their stuff. No one said a word to me, and it was maybe the most awkward 30 seconds of my life, there was tension in the room. After they left, my wife told me that she had come downstairs and told them that I did not want them to stay the night.\n\nMy wife and I argued after they left, she thinks she did nothing wrong and I can't believe she made me look like such an asshole, and how awkward it will be when I have to see these people again.

You're right. I must not have seen that wife changed the dynamic. Still, OP said sure, wife operated under known circumstances and then he calls her names when she went with what she knew. Wife should have waited, surely, but didn't deserve what she got when she didn't know she was wronging the husband. OP could have said 'can we talk about it later / after they're gone' instead of just giving permission for something he didn't want to happen in the first place.", "OP said they are friends because of the kids.

Also it can be dangerous for young children to be around unvaccinated kids (particularly if your baby is too young to be vaccinated)", "Just to blanket answer some of the questions I've seen in the comments, yes the couple was in earshot when she asked about them staying over sometime in the future.

Your wife should have talked to you in private first. She made an offer that should have never been extended, then blamed you for defending your own boundaries that she was not respectful of.

Need more info on that.  I think you could have handled the conversation with your wife better - it sounds like your emotions were out of control.  The real problem here is that your wife has found what she considers to be an ideal friend couple.  She is close with the wife, the kids are the same age so she can hang out with her friend without childcare being an issue.  My guess is that marriage and having kids has probably interfered with some of her longstanding friendships.  She sees this couple as being a perfect way to manage motherhood and maintain a social life.

He curses out his wife for believing his fib when he thinks that the guests can't hear, then gets mad when she tells them that the husband doesn't want them there because he loses face.

He also slipped into calling it his house and his baby. \n\nI also have very little patience for people who curse out and insult their spouses. It's one thing if there is a life threatening situation, but generally speaking,  I find that behavior unacceptable, bordering on abusive. It's such a breakdown of the team dynamic that it's something that I find nearly inexcusable. Especially given that op doesn't seem to regret it.

Ask her why she would do this with people she knows you do not like. Finally, tell her this will not happen again without private discussion ahead of time. \nI also think you and your wife need to make a conscious effort to find other toddler parents to have play dates with. It sounds like these people have a belief system that does not line up well with yours. As your child gets older they will hear the things these people are saying.

Do you really want that?", "NTA\n\nI cant help but think there must be SOME explanation for them wanting to stay over. Thats so bizarre to me. And with a child? \n\nDid their power get shut off?

Finally, my husband let one of them borrow one of my things, I was so mad, I don't lend stuff out ever. Turned out, he repurchased the item the next day and told me he was sorry, but this was our ticket to freedom. We knew based on the wife's behavior, she would never return it so everytime she came over or walked past us, we'd ask, hey, can you get that item back to us?
