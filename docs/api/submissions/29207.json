It is not a sin to not want to be a part of family celebrations if you don't feel like family. They need to get over themselves and let you be.", "NTA. He literally brought you up not to care about birthday parties.", "NTA. it's your choice about going or not. I get that 80 is a milestone birthday and all but it sounds like you haven't had a relationship with him in years. I don't blame you for not going.", "NTA. He's never cared about any of your birthdays, why would you care about his?", "NTA - it\u2019s your life and your choice. It doesn\u2019t sound like you had the best relationship with him and most of your family over the years. There\u2019s a saying about how children treat their parents in their old age being a direct reflection of their parenting.", "They all started SHITTING on you?? Gross", "Imma say nta but damn dude that's shits cold. I can't imagine not going to my parents 80th. Like this Def feels like u don't really care that much about ur family", "ESH - your family for not celebrating your birthdays and inflicting trauma and you for carrying this for so long and not working on it.  Go NC with your family if you want but realistically that should\u2019ve happened a while back so you are A H to time this for your fathers 80th.", "You are being vindictive.  This was his 80th birthday.\nBirthdays are to pay tribute whether you like your father or not.  How many more 80th birthdays will he have?   You could at the least made an appearance, had some cake and leave.  He lived 8 decades.  He should be honored for making it to 80.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And good for you for cutting out these assholes.", "NTA. By the way, Happy Birthday!!!", "I would almost blame the siblings more, as OP says they were much older. It is possible though, that they were likewise raised not to be sentimental about things. Without a complete narrative about the circumstances surrounding the mother\u2019s death, it is difficult to know just how at fault the father was. A male born in the early forties would have been raised to have zero knowledge about raising children, zero knowledge about anything to do with running a household, and would have not been encouraged to show excess emotion or sentimentality. I hope OP has received some therapy because this was not a good way to grow up.", "Thanks. I just don't really care about them. I hung around until my education was paid for and I took off. I had a small inheritance from my mom that I used to start a small business. I don't really need anything from them so they have no power over me.", "You can't imagine skipping 18 years' worth of birthdays either yet you had no problem glossing over that for why OP isn't interested.", "Well, OP had birthdays, too, also landmark ones like 18 and 21, it sounds like the father didn't do anything for hers. He couldn't even be bothered to attend his grandson's first birthday party, he preferred to go golfing in Mexico instead. He's reaping what he's sown."]}
