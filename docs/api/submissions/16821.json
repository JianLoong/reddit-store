{"id": 16821, "submission_id": "13d1raa", "title": "AITA for not allowing my husband to give my daughter's phone to my MIL?", "selftext": "My MIL has leukaemia and has been in and out of hospital quite a lot for the past 3 years. It's especially difficult to get any updates on her condition when she is in hospital because she hasn't put my husband (her only child and only living relative) as her next of kin on her forms so the staff are reluctant to give him information. And she refuses to get a mobile phone. The last time she got out of hospital my husband told her how stressful it was trying to get information on how she was doing, and she told him that he would have to deal with it because she has no interest in getting a mobile phone.\n\nWhen I got a new phone last year, I gave my 10 year old daughter my old one. She primarily uses it to upload YouTube shorts. She's been working at uploading every day recently and got her 9th subscriber and 100th view a few days ago - she was ecstatic and said she was going to keep building her channel and become a YouTuber. \n\nTonight, my MIL phoned my husband and said she wanted his advice. She told him she'd been to see her GP, who told her if she didn't go to the hospital right away she wouldn't live to see the morning. She wanted to know what she should do. He told her it was obvious what she should do - go to the hospital! She said she didn't like the idea of going to the hospital and wanted him to give her an alternative. He told her to stop being ridiculous and get to the hospital ASAP. He asked her why the GP didn't arrange an ambulance if it was that serious, and she said she told the GP not to bother phoning an ambulance because she has a lunch tomorrow afternoon and she would have to make arrangements to reschedule it and also arrange for her dog to be cared for. \n\nAfter a few minutes of back and forth, she told my husband that she wasn't going to phone an ambulance and disturb the paramedics, that she would just see how she goes overnight and if she dies, she dies. My husband then said he would come over and bring her himself, to which she was very thankful.\n\nMy husband then came to me and asked where my daughter's phone was, I said it was in her room and asked why. He said he was taking it to give to MIL while she's in hospital and I told him he wasn't.\n\nI told him that 1) it was my phone and I gave it to our daughter. 2) if MIL wanted a phone, she's had more than enough time to get one. 3) Our daughter would feel like she was being punished by having her phone removed, and 4) if MIL wanted him to have information about her while she's in hospital, she'd have made him her next of kin. He has made it clear to her how difficult it is for him to get information, but she hasn't done anything to make it easier. \n\nHe got really angry with me and said I'm being difficult and he's left in a huff with me. \n\nI rang my mum to vent and she said that I should have given over my daughter's phone, but my dad said I was absolutely in the right. Now I'm conflicted.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit to add: several people are focusing on the fact that my daughter uses YouTube. While I understand the concern, her face appeared briefly in 2 videos that have now been deleted. The videos she uploads are mostly stop-motion videos involving her toys and random household objects so she doesnt appear in them at all, and comments are switched off. I also didn't ask about that, I asked if I was the asshole for not letting MIL take the phone.", "created_utc": 1683656932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13d1raa/aita_for_not_allowing_my_husband_to_give_my/", "score": 848, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she wants him to know what's going on, she can make that happen. Bringing this person a phone she hasn't asked for is not a solution to any of the current problems. Your husband needs counseling to understand how his mother's push and pull has messed him up, unless he would like to also screw up his own children.", "Don't hospital rooms have phones ?", "NTA\n\nMIL should just put her only living relative as next of kin.

Very cheap.\n\nAlso I don't understand how she can be admitted to a hospital without having designated a Medical Power of Attorney. This is standard procedure when people are admitted as you have to supply one as well as a check off in terms of how you want DNR and other stuff handled. The hospital needs to know who is designated to make medical decisions if the sick person for whatever reason isn't.", "NTA. Punishing your daughter by taking away, effectively STEALING, her property to give to someone else who's made it clear they don't want it, sounds like a wild idea to me. Why doesn't he just buy a basic mobile phone for MIL? You can get one under \u00a3100 that can text and call, and it sounds like that's all she'd need it for. Aside from the fact she's made it very clear she doesn't want one. I understand that the phone was bought by the parents, but the phone was given to the daughter, and what kind of tone are you going to be setting by taking it back to give to someone who can buy their own and refuses to do so? How is she supposed to feel about her property being taken away?\n\nIf he wants to give someone else's property to MIL he can always give her his phone and buy himself a new one instead of stealing from his kid...", "NTA.

But it's her decision to make. ...and I suspect that if she were handed a mobile,  she would just skip charging it,  anyway,  because she is choosing,  for whatever reasons, to be uncommunicative except when it suits her.\n\nI understand that your husband feels very powerless here and my heart aches for him.

Gas stations sell burner phones.", "NTA. If your husband wants a phone for his mom he should buy her a burner. They are cheap and do the job. Why should your daughter loose her phone when it is so easy to get his mom one of her own?  Stick to your guns and let your daughter keep her phone.", "NTA.

You\u2019re encouraging your small child to put herself on the internet when she doesn\u2019t have the emotional maturity to understand that responsibility, or the cognitive awareness to understand what a big deal that is. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason it\u2019s typically frowned upon for kids to post pictures and videos of themselves. We all did it and many of us deeply regret it. There\u2019s videos of me online as a child I\u2019m trying to get taken down but can\u2019t. For you to not only allow that, but *encourage* it is ridiculous. Do you know how many people target children that post videos? They do that because it\u2019s easy access and it shows that the parents aren\u2019t as responsible as they should be. \n\nYou\u2019re setting your ten year old up for a life of adults masturbating to her and trying to get in contact with her.

I'm sure she's sick and I'm sure that's awful, but she's demanding that your husband cater to her without even bothering to put him down as her emergency contact.  She's playing the game in both directions and it's crappy of her.\n\nYour husband sucks because he's not only playing into her manipulation, but also stealing from your kid.  Is your kid also his kid?  It's not clear from the post.\n\nYou suck, for letting your TEN YEAR OLD play around uploading videos on Youtube.\n\nYour family is not irredeemable, but this situation doesn't make anyone (except kiddo) look golden.", "ESH the MIL is manipulative as hell, your spouse has no spine to her but takes it out on you, you are petty as you know full well giving up the phone is a reasonable ask until a permanent solution can be made.

Did you husband explicitly mention that he was giving the phone away for good?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is an AH and a shitty parent.", "YTA. Not the time to pick a fight. Also- your husband needs support. Its a stressful time. He doesn't need someone listing out points of why they are right. He knows his mother is being difficult but she's also very sick. Shes scared and stressed. Probably worried about her dog, worried about being a bother to her son (i imagine she's had run in's with you over the years and is trying to avoid it now). If she's so sick she could of died overnight, maybe worry more about her and less about a 10 year old having a phone. Give the phone to MIL for now. 10 year old can have it back later. Not that she should even be posting you tube videos at her age anyways. Quit calling your mom to complain. Go support your family.", "NAH. You\u2019re right to not give in, your MIL is acting very strangely - is her illness causing any dementia? That\u2019s the only kind take I can think for how much she is stressing your husband. \n\nYour husband shouldn\u2019t have tried to take your daughter\u2019s phone, but it sounds like he\u2019s is super stressed by his mother, so he should get a pass.", "ESH (edited from YT because really everyone is awful in this - leaving my comments as to why OP is an AH)\n\nLook, some of your points aren't wrong, but that doesn't mean you aren't an AH.\n\nAnd you added to your husband's stress as he's dealing with a dying, or at least dramatic, mother.\n\nYou can always get another phone for your daughter with a minimal plan. Or just an old phone for her.\n\nYou also missed out on a teaching moment, no reason for your daughter to think she's being \"punished.\"\n\nI'm a bit gobsmacked at how righteous you think you are for the argument you picked at the time you picked it.", "Yes, YTA. It was an emergency. Your husband wanted his mother to have a phone for his ease and his peace of mind - not hers. He wanted it for her stay in the hospital, not for her to keep forever.

She isn't in any of them.", "I have lived this story.  Perpetually dying; won't let anyone go with them to a medical appointment with them. Won't let anyone talk to their doctor.  Because then *The Tower of Lies* would collapse. \n\nWill insist what they are telling you is true, even when it's impossible.  Do not try to tell me my grandFATHER has \"uterus cancer\".\n\nHe needs to set firm boundaries, and hold to them.  \n\ni.e. Telling her he's calling the doctor's office to confirm, and doing it.   While they can't give out info without permission, you can say:  \"Mom says Doctor X said she needs to go to the hospital immediately.  Have you called an ambulance, or shall I?\"\n\nIf she doesn't want him listed as next of kin, don't try tracking her down at the hospital. If she's truly ill, someone will contact him.  Or she'll get tired of nobody paying attention to her, and will call him.\n\nThere's no \"WIN\" here, only Sanity Management.", "\"okay, please call me when you're really dead\"", "That makes sense.\n\nNeutropenic sepsis implies she currently has an infection she is not able to fight due to the low neutrophil count.  The other possibility here (given it is the GP giving this info) is her just have neutropenia (low neutrophils, no infection).\n\nI'm always happy to hear from relatives if there are specific issues that might be useful to know, as long as they accept I am not giving out information due to confidentiality.  While I am unable to give out any information, there is nothing stopping me from receiving useful information from 3rd parties.", "Is that a new word to you? (Sincere question)", "Maybe MIL doesn't want it or doesn't give out that number.", "Yeah but these parents don't care and don't take the time to actually do their jobs as parents.", "Irresponsible and out of touch. \n\nSame reason they let kids play Cod or other violent games even though you have more than enough parenting tools to prevent it. And you know, basic care in what they do. \n\nLazy parents create lazy kids which creates a lazy society. We're doomed.", "In the US here.  Have relatives working in 2 hospitals.  Michigan and Alabama.  One big, one small hospital.  Both have phones in the rooms and one that can be brought to the ICU, etc.  one (couldn\u2019t reach the other) said every hospital she has worked at has phones available.  Some are even attached (electronic/plugged into) the fancy beds.", "Except if the hospital was built in the 1920s when lots of people didn't have phones, then they just kinda... never got them fitted? Some wards in the UK have a \"comms unit\" which has a tv and a phone, others have a phone station or a trolley thing. Most hospitals now have wifi for patients, but it's patchy.", "You have no sources, only snark. That\u2019s not how adults make arguments. Wish you the best."]}
