You absolutely shouldn't't ever consider marrying him, having a kid with him or buy a house together.", "NTA - do you know he bought it and it was a gift? If he bought it, he's made his priorities clear. Legos over you.", "NTA - Finances are a big stress for relationships and it's vital that you can feel comfortable being on the same page. 33 is a bit late to be starting to learn that sort of lesson or for that matter responsible spending if finances are indeed tight. \n\nGiven just how much it is I can certainly see a scenario where he hasn't purchased it so I would say it's reasonable to give him a chance to explain but if he did buy it that's shocking behavior.", "INFO: You say repeated behaviour?
