How does it make you feel?\" We say it makes us feel bad, of course.  \n\n\nThen he tells us why they were arguing and why they were upset...even though we heard it, and heard it a million times.

This time, it struck me as odd. Even though there's a lot I *could* say and recommend, instead I said:  \n\n\n\"Not to be rude, but honestly, Dad, we've heard this all from you two our entire lives.

Why are they including you in their marriage drama?!? Why do they need your participation or feedback?!? Why have they never thought of therapy?!?WHY? WHY? WHY?", "NTA. Explaining your s**t only counts if you then fix it. They mention a commitment to work through it so therapy is the perfect response.\n\nYou should work on getting your own place.", "NTA, honestly it was a good advice.", "NTA. Your parents really need therapy by the sounds of it. Stop being involved with their strange games and live your own life. Best of Luck.", "NTA. Honestly at this point I agree that getting professional help would be a relief for the whole family. Especially if it's interfering with your job too. It wasn't said out of disrespect but genuine concern.", "NTA. You and your brother are well past the age when parents need to help kids feel secure after an argument. If you phrased it as you did in your post that's perfectly reasonable and respectful. You and your brother do not need to be in involved in their arguments unless they actually involve you. \n\nEven if this argument post mortem/debrief was helpful at one point in time, it's definitely time for them to develop new strategies and leave the two of you out of it. Fingers crossed you can find reasonable rent in the very near future.", "NTA, and well done.  Your parents need to pay trained professionals to help them work things out, not to dump core on you.", "NTA.  If you two do not like the environment, it is up to you to move out since you are both adults.  I would have said, \"we are not therapists so please quit discussing your marital issues with us as it is none of our business, it is entirely between the two of you and only the two of you.\"  If they have been doing this their entire lives, they will not change.  The idea is to let them know in a polite way that you two do not need to hear any of that information.", "NTA. Whatever problems are going on between your parents are your parents' problems to solve, not yours or your brother's. And since the problems have been going on for your entire lives, then it's clear they need professional help, since at this point nothing you or your brother have been saying to them has stuck. It isn't your fault for pointing out the truth.", "NTA, it\u2019s weird that the adults have been going to their children for relationship advice basically forever and not a trained professional. I\u2019m all for explaining to your kids that you\u2019re going to work on the relationship and sometimes disagreements and arguments can lead to feelings overflowing, but the advice thing stuck me as\u2026odd.", "NTA at all. Your parents need to take their problems up with a professional or at least with their closest friends and/or family. NOT their kids. That's a really bad brew--more harmful than any of the behaviors they're actually complaining about!- From now on, you guys should feel wholly justified by shutting this down the second they try to start it up; tell them to get some professional help or deal with their own problems instead of dumping their angst on their kids.", "NTA\n\nI commend your parents for talking to you but you are not a marriage counselor. They asked for your opinions and you gave it. It was \"get therapy\". I think it's great that parents talk to their children about issues but this is not the same thing. They are using you like you're a marriage counselor. When my ex and I would fight around our children, we would sit them down and ask them how they felt. We would apologize to them for behaving in a way that hurt them and talk about what we can do in the future to prevent us from hurting them again. Your parents are actually just trying to involve you in the fight. They are laying out their problems to you and that is something they should never ever do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They reacted poorly to that.\n\nFunny thing is that this part of their family meetings with you and your brother:\n\n>we would listen and give advice\n\nsounds an awful lot like therapy.\n\nThe therapy advice was good. They probably didn't like it because it would mean taking their problems to a trained profession. A pro who would call them on their bs when it appeared. Instead of dumping their problems on their kids, who can't really do that. At least not without risking long term family strife.\n\nWhen they try to do this to you in the future, just keep repeating \"We are not your therapists.

Sounds less like they're being helpful and caring, and much more like they just love the drama so much they're trying to spin it out as far as possible by involving their kids.

Finally she went to a real therapist, got the help she needed, and finally divorced my dad and had a very happy and fulfilled life with intermittent checkups when she realized she needed to get back on track.  You and your brother are not and should not be scapegoated into listening to their problems.  Next time it happens, just walk away.  I loved my mom for getting the outside help she needed, and if your parents truly love you both, they'll do the same and ignore having you playing therapist.", "It sounds very frustrating to see this cycle repeat itself, and be subjected to its play-by-play.\n\nYou are not beholden to take part in this...performative atonement.\n\nIt seems like they are externalizing their problems and requiring validation that their fights are a) just and b) handled correctly.
