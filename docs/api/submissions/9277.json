I should have just sat back and watched her rake Nicole over the coals.", "Indeed. I'm surprised by how many people here seem to think that just because someone is being a jerk, everyone has a free pass to be a total jerk to them back. \n\nSure, Nicole was being an AH (seemingly out of insecurity), but you're still also an AH if you retaliate to the same measure just for the sake of it. \n\nNow, is it as bad as being an AH without provocation? No. But there's still better ways to handle a situation.", " Also like it was a family gathering, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Paris handled it the way she did to avoid a scene, even if Nicole didn\u2019t throw her plate Op\u2019s comment was the sort you\u2019d expect to provoke an argument.", "I'm not sure being kind to bullies actually accomplishes anything.", "Paris didn't insult Nicole, why should she apologize? She just asked how many boyfriends should a 23 year old have?", "She got a serving of her own dish because she couldn\u2019t throw it that far", "Not sure how there is any doubt.  Nicole was clearly implying Paris was a s&\\^t.  You don't get to do that and expect no pushback.", "Ouch!  LOL", "Right?\n\nThe internet cannot handle nuance, man.", "Ah yes! I'll call you a nun and you throw food at me. All is right and the world is balanced once more.", "I agree Nicole is a bully. And if OP had called out her comment as out of line, I absolutely would have been supportive.
