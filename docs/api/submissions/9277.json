Very much a \"don't dish it if you can't take it\" mentality. \n\nNicole decided to butt in and shame Paris for having had six boyfriends by 23. That's a fairly normal amount of partners to have had by then. Nicole also isn't abnormal for not having had one. Different people live different lives. \n\nHad Nicole not made a rude comment, this would have been a non-issue. But Nicole acted like a bully and tried to shame Paris for her romantic life up to that point. Once Nicole instigated the argument, it was fair game for OP to clap back, and a fairly simple one at that. OP didn't suggest why Nicole had no romantic success at that point, only stated the fact that she hadn't - much like Nicole did in regards to Paris.\n\n If Nicole couldn't take a tame response like the one OP gave, she shouldn't have interjected in the first place. Based on Nicole's reaction to OP's comment, she's probably used to getting away with rude comments like that. \n\nDid OP need to make the comment? No. Does that make OP and AH? I'd say also no. If OP had decided to list all of the possible reasons why Nicole hadn't any romantic partners at that point, that would have been too much.", "10/10", "Okay, but what exactly is the benefit of \"fighting fire with fire\" at least in this situation? Let's look at this purely from a \"this is how we deal with bullies\" kind of a situation. \n\nNicole is clearly insecure and feels badly about her dating life, which is causing her to lash out. In response to her one can either strike back (as 2 people in this situation have done), or gently correct her comment (e.g. just say \"I don't think 6 partners for a X-year old is very much\" and move on). \n\nBy lashing out back at her, Nicole is going to feel bad. If this is the goal, I guess it was achieved? However, do you think that's going to make Nicole any less likely to feel resentful and insecure about her dating life in the future, or to learn \"learn her lesson\" and be nicer? I doubt that. Probably she's just going to feel worse, and in the future will be just as much of an asshole.\n\nNow, if one was to respond more kindly and/or ignore her, would she be less of an asshole in the future? Maybe not. But at least she wouldn't be *more* likely to be an asshole. By gently correcting her, she'd still get the message that people don't agree with her, and would understand that her comment was disapproved of, but at least she wouldn't become more angry and resentful. \n\nAnd even if you discount everything I've just said, there's still nothing to be gained from being mean to her back. Clearly someone who feels the need to make these kinds of comments has had to deal with some unfortunate shit to end up that way. What's there to be gained from making them feel more bad? You get to feel great about yourself for dealing some sort of social justice by humiliation and making someone feel even worse about themself?
