Because I wouldn't offer that to anyone.", "Course he took it home. Needed it for the next party!!", "Ugh I attended a cottage weekend with a guy like that. He brought cheap shitty beer and only drank our pricy craft beer. Not only that, he would forget about them and leave fallen soldiers all over the place, then kept grabbing more of our beer! We ended up hiding most of it in our room for the rest of the weekend with a limited amount in the fridge.", "Bingo. Trash.", "Should\u2019ve sold it to a local frat.", "Cheap beer works great in a lot of sauces. Beer quality doesn't matter so much for that sort of thing", "OMG, you totally described our current refrigerator (which came with the house, we didn\u2019t actually choose that POS)! I had no idea that it was a common selling-point for fridges to be left behind in a recently-sold house.\n\nWe don\u2019t even use the produce or meat drawers. We do use the slide-out \u201cbeverage drawer\u201d for bottles of water cuz they are easily wiped-clean. And we are saving/planning for a new fridge very soon.", "Such self discipline.  A glass of water handy?  What are you, the fucking Queen of England?\n\nJk, jk, I\u2019m just jealous that you\u2019re out there living life making reasonable choices while I\u2019m still being the same dumb ass.", "Oh I can remember the nights of drinking too much Killians\u2026.well, kind of remember.", "Don't worry, being a dumb ass is much more fun than being sensible. :D", "Dumbass talking here i assume:-p"]}
