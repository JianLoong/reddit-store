I wouldn't let him see them until he is able to accept that you're getting divorced and he needs to figure out a visitation schedule. When you can file for full custody even though you intend to allow him visitation if he's willing to commit, getting a court ordered schedule will only help you in the long run. If he wants to be involved he can, if he doesn't you'll be able to demonstrate he isn't exercising his parenting time.\n\nIt sounds like he wants to be a part time dad. A dad when he feels like it. That is very damaging to kids, especially little ones.  \n\nI saw a lot of comments about how it's being cruel your kids by denying their father. You're not denying their father- you are holding him accountable for being a good parent. It his choice to refuse to commit to a schedule. That is NOT YOUR FAULT. \n\nWhen your kids are old enough get them into therapy. It will get better !

You need to do what's best for your children and without a visitation schedule he could just not bring them back. Funny thing about custody, if it's not established then either one of you could just hold on to the children. Especially at their young age when you don't have schools or anything established who the primary caretaker is. \n\nSo no you're not wrong in keeping them.... And I would never say to keep a kid away from their parent, but in this instance with him living farther away and him & his family the way they are, I would absolutely wait until there was a custody order.\n\nBUT If that custody order says he sees them every other weekend you don't get to circumvent that and refuse to let him because it's not frequent enough for you! You can let it be known at the custody hearing that you want them to be on a more frequent visitation schedule, But the thing about visitation is that if he's supposed to get them every weekend and he doesn't come one weekend there's nothing you can do.

Not for your daughter to see your ex. It\u2019s messy when it\u2019s involving kids. And it\u2019s emotional and it\u2019s hard.

As young as they are, I'd probably want him under supervised visitation as he's not proven he can care for a newborn(or 2 yr old) responsibly.

Make sure you have strict guidelines written in court orders(ie no, a future girlfriend of his cannot pick up or be the sole caretaker during his visitation/custodial time.  He has to be there.

I said he can see them as much as he wants but I need a schedule not just whenever he feels like it.\n\nIt sounds like you wanted him to tell you how often he will see her, he made a suggestion and you told him it wasn't enough?  So is the issue he isn't setting a visitation schedule or he isn't setting one frequent enough to be acceptable to you?", "Here's the thing. Yes, it would be ideal if he saw them more frequently but if the effort he's willing to make is a day/every other week. I think you have to say fine and tell him you need him to sit down now for the next 3 months/6 months and set out the visitations. And tell him that you know the kids would love to see him more so if it works for his schedule, you'll be happy to try to make something work- you just need notice.\n\nCuz here's the thing. He's a father. Not a babysitter. It's his responsibility to take care of his kids. To make sure he has things like car seats so he can take them. That he knows how to appropriately parent both of them. And yes, that means he has to want to make the effort and figure out how to spend the money for a 6 hour drive to see his kids or if he can move closer so he can see them more. And how to co-parent with you. \n\nBecause at the end of the day- whether you and he stay married or not- your children deserve that much from him.\n\nBut in the meantime- you need to focus on moving forward. You've filed for child support, which is good. I assume you've spoken with an attorney about filing for divorce/separation. That process generally will help with things like custody and visitation because it will get hammered out during that process.\n\nIf you really want to consider giving him a second chance- you can. That's up to you. But figure out what you'd need to see from him. And how he can prove to you that he won't just do it for 3 months until you agree to let him move back in but that's it's  something he'll keep up and you won't be back here in a year or 5.\n\nESH Mild towards you but I think you need to accept that you can't insist on the visitation schedule that you wish he would want just as you can't make him that dad you wish he was.", ">I put NTA because of the reasons you mention   \nBUT she has a few red flags as well.  \n>  \n>She's asking about getting alimony in a separate post(another subreddit).  \n>  \n>If she's so in need of money, how is she renting a luxury apt while he's renting a room out of someone's home?

But then again, that\u2019s also not what was being asked in the thread. It was asked if she was TAH for not allowing him to see his kids - in which case she is. \n\nI\u2019d be saying this same exact thing if the parent in question was a woman. \n\nThe babysitting comment was roughly 2 months ago - and as out of pocket as is was, isn\u2019t about the current visitation communication. \n\n*if the parent wants to be in their kids life, and is not a threat, don\u2019t you want them together??* my sister doesn\u2019t have the best relationship with my nieces father, in fact I hate his guts and personally feel like she\u2019s better off without him. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the truth, and any opinion that\u2019s not about the child and fathers relationship is irrelevant in the sense that someone could be a crap partner and an amazing parent. You don\u2019t get to decide to withhold children like pawns just because you disagree with the other adult.", "No, but if they do go into court and he's telling the judge that she refused him visitation, that shit will bite her in the ass.", "I know from experience that he can be kept from their home, but not from outside events and whatnot. If they're ever left with a babysitter, he can definitely show up with a sherif and a copy of the birth certificate. At the very least. Don't know how the laws are where you are.", "I imagine that's why he dated her, married her and hot her pregnant.", "Info: is there a waiting period for your divorce to go to court without his signature? Some states have minimum waiting periods, but his actions, if you have then documented, could constitute some level of abandonment of the marriage and the kids. \n\nAre you able to get a lawyer to walk you through this? Every state has some sort of Legal Aid, plus family lawyers who could take your case pro-bono (free). \n\nThis is a terrible situation for you, but you are NTA for sticking to your guns, not getting back with him, and protecting your children. Good luck!", "Ha, I didn't realize until you said it ..this is the exact age gap between me and my husband, and we met a little under 10 years older than these two (and that was more than 10 years ago). It's not the size of the gap it's the length of the leverage.", "Yup because the issue isn\u2019t the 12 year age gap it\u2019s the age they were when they met", "I truthfully only know how it goes cause my cuz ex wouldn't sign so he had to have a judge do it but it was 18 months he had to wait before granted.", "Fair, just wanted to check. :)", "Without a court order, there is no custody. So legally means nothing.", "Age gaps are always about power dynamics. A 28 year old dating someone who is 10 years or 15 years older is not as bad as a barely legal kid dating someone who is already in their 30s.\n\nPeople like to say that sometimes it works, but... That's not the point. The red flag is there to make you pause and consider it if other things come up.", "No, if there's not a custody order, then it's all just murky at best. Everything reverts to what is on the birth certificate.", "NTA Now here's some things to NEVER forget:\n\n1) You don't need his cooperation to divorce him. That will make the process longer and a bigger pain in the neck, but he can't stop it. File for divorce and don't back down.\n\n2) I'm sorry you can't take that vacation as soon as you want, but his refusal doesn't mean they can never get passports, just that you have to go through the courts. Start that petition, too.\n\n3) No court set visitation/custody schedule, no visitation. End of story.", "NTA", "What does your divorce lawyer advise? I'd be worried in your shoes about whether you're giving your ex ammunition to use against you in court re: withholding his children from him or trying to take them out if the country against his wishes.  I'm not saying you *are* doing those things, only that they may be spun that way in court.\n\nIf your lawyer's approved what you're doing, then by all means, carry on, and you'll be NTA.", "f\u00e3k\u00eb", "NTA. You are doing amazing and doing exactly what is best for you and your babies. It would be unfair to them to have him come and go as he feels, heartbreaking even. I hope you stuck to this path, because he obviously doesn't respect you, have any interest in actual parenting, and has a horrible family that he listens to too much. \n\nStick with that luxury apartment, bc you are fucking killing it!", "This is sage advice. \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Man also has a bedroom in a house with strangers. He doesnt have car seats. He has not yet created a safe, suitable environment for young kids.\nI get that it can take time to get those things in order cause money but this just seems like a man who does not care about these children beyond their use as a tool to hurt OP.", ">What did you expect from \u00e0 30 year old man Who married an 18 year old and got her pregnant (if he didn't do that before her 18th birthday) ?\n\nWhile the age gap is extremely concerning, it reads like you're blaming still young OP for this situation and not the grown man who is terrible in a multitude of ways.", "So nosey\ud83e\udd2d My parents switch off watching my babies along with my sister, if I didn\u2019t have them I\u2019d  be paying 2K in daycare expenses. Kids are not cheap & neither are bills! I had to work more since I\u2019m now the sole provider I was only working weekends to pay for stuff for my kids & my own expenses etc. so I could take care of & be with my kids more. My father is well off he\u2019s been helping me out until I\u2019m back to work & able to get back on my feet. Yes he would provide the expenses for vacation not that\u2019s it\u2019s relative", "& he\u2019s a bum he keeps quitting jobs and spends all of his money on drugs & cigarettes god knows what else..", "Age gaps are much less bad when both parties are over 30. 18-28 is basically still a kid in so SO many ways.", "People who date 18 year olds only do because it's illegal to date younger.\n\nSeriously though I'm 30 and I can't imagine. There's an actor whose work I admire and they're 20 and I'm just fully in, \"That is my CHILD\" mode about them. They're just babies at 18.", "Also I was on unpaid maternity leave when he left I just had a baby so..", "Your knew he was a bum and still married him.", "It's why the age/2+7 formula generally works pretty well for an estimate of \"ick\" factor. A 40 year old can date a 28 year old, and it makes sense. They're both independent adults, so it's all good. A 28 year old dating an 18 year old hits the \"ick\" factor. Makes sense because an 18 year old is usually not fully independent, but a 28 year old is. It's not a perfect way to tell, but it's a pretty decent ballpark point."]}
