Lemonade only goes a few ways- too surgery, too lemony, or too watery. You know, based on the three ingredients. So it was ok. What level of Gordon Ramsay bacon-infused lemonade were they looking for??? And now, because I\u2019m tipsy and it\u2019s 11 pm, I GOTTA KNOW what is A tier lemonade to this person. Was there an Applebees out there that just nailed it? Aunt Helen\u2019s summertime Tupperware pitcher? Vodka lemonade (affectionally named Double Lemonade in my family to keep things quiet at the kid\u2019s soccer games)?", "\"Lemonade foodies\" \nThis is the expression I needed to cheer me up, thanks", "Yeah our neighbors across the street many years back were selling lemonade. I think it's the first and only lemonade stand I've ever seen irl, lol. I don't even think it was \u00a8real\u00a8 lemonade, just the little pouches of flavored powder mixed with water variety.  I still bought some for myself and my entire household for the same reason I bought  the overpriced girlscout cookies and the beef sticks the boy scouts sell every year til I moved overseas. Sometimes it's  just nice to see kids out there that have found something important enough to them that they will go out and work their little butts off to raise money for it and I want to show some support and solidarity with their efforts.", "Same here. We would buy lemonade from the neighbor kids across the street, just to be nice. Never drank the stuff, though, it was terrible! But they were good kids and tried their best.", "Aw, that's such a sweet story!", "There was a big neighborhood garage sale here. One teen was trying to raise money for a choir trip. We specifically went by and picked out a few pieces of jewelry she made. My hubs gave her an extra five bucks. I think it was the only sale she\u2019d made o far. Hopefully more people went by and helped her out.", "exactly this \ud83d\udc97", "The best way of reliving the best parts of your childhood is to go make them happen in somebody else's!", "Aw!

Most people that didn\u2019t want to donate would have probably just smiled, said no thank you, and moved on with their day. But not you. I\u2019m sure you can rest easy at night now knowing that kid got a free lesson in price theory. An important lesson for all adolescent lemonade stand venture capitalists, no doubt.\n\nAlso, most people probably wouldn\u2019t ask for a free sample of lemonade a child is selling for charity, like they\u2019re pillaging their local Sams Club, but you sure weren\u2019t too proud.

If a kid at a lemonade stand asks if you want lemonade, if you're that concerned about price, you ask how much first - not as an afterthought after you already drank a glass.

YTA", "An 'obscure story' about a charity... the CHILD not perfectly articulating the charity she's trying to support when asked by a grown ass adult (who hasn't seen a lemonade stand in decades and probably thinks lemonade is probably still a nickel for a glass) demands a sample clearly means she's a massive scammer!\n\nDoes he ask for a specific nutrition breakdown if he spots a brownie at an elusive  bakesale held by small children? There literally isn't a single step in this story that isn't wild. Asking for a sample, critiquing her description of the charity, scrutinizing the price of the lemonade (buddy if you haven't seen a lemonade stand in decades maybe your idea of pricing is a bit out of date), criticizing the quality of her lemonade, and then refusing to pay?? The reason she didn't know how to pour a sample cup of lemonade stand lemonade is because no normal human asks for a sample!", "572nd here", "Exactly.

I think I've even seen lemonade a few times. I usually buy something if I'm walking by because the way I see it is that their parents are actually teaching them about the value of money and that not everything can be a handout. I'm all for supporting good parenting that leads to potentially less entitled children. Besides, young kids can't and rightfully shouldn't have actual jobs. I loved your story! OP is definitely an AH. If he couldn't spare $5, he shouldn't have engaged.", "This is a sweet story.  Thanks for being a good human", "One time we pulled into a cup de sac after driving past and seeing kids sitting up at the top of it at what looked like a lemonade stand. I felt bad bc obviously tucked away like that they weren't going to get any customers so pull up i hand my son a few bucks to give them whether (he got a lemonade or not). He turned back to face me looking a mix between embarrassed and confused(he was very shy back then so I assumed that was the issue), and the kids mothers came over and asked what was wrong...I get out to explain and they started laughing bc those kids were literally just playing in front of their houses \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I started laughing as one of them ran into the house to grab little snack bags for us bc we stopped for her kids when it was so out of the way.
