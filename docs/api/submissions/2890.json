She does everything for Alexa. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest. Alexa is a brat who honestly gets on my nerves. It\u2019s like she exists to make my wife\u2019s life miserable. She\u2019s arrogant, rude, entitled, nasty. She constantly broke rules and none of her teachers ever liked her. She refused therapy.

I told her I only put up with her spoiled self to be with my wife and I was annoyed whenever she intruded. Alexa started sobbing and ran out. I told my wife everything and she said I was right to turn her down but didn\u2019t have to be so harsh. She thanked me for being honest. Her parents are furious. I\u2019ve gotten a bunch of weird text messages from what I suspect are alexa\u2019s friends. AITA?\n\nEdit: I would never do anything because Alexa is literally a kid I\u2019ve seen grow up.

I'm so glad you clarified things for her. I don't get your wife's reaction though.", "you handled it perfectly", "Yikes. You did the right thing. NTA.", "What a massive betrayal to her sister! What the heck?!", "It is wildly inappropriate but also par for the course for a 19 year old girl who was shipped off to another country by her parents to be raised by her sister. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s acting this way at 35. She\u2019s 19 & obviously profoundly damaged. Her brain wouldn\u2019t even be done developing WITHOUT the damage.", "So what non-jaded people do is hit on their siblings' spouses? I guess I'm the most jaded person in the world because I won't hit on ***anyone else's*** spouse!", "You don\u2019t need to be harsh off the bat to make yourself clear.", "People don\u2019t finish developing till age 25. There\u2019s obviously something going on with her.", "There are so many other words to express horror and rejection at a totally inappropriate and offensive romantic advance than (to paraphrase)  \u201cI loathed you even as a child and was only nice to you because I like your sister.\u201d  It\u2019s just so damaging for an obviously already damaged person. I do not think this is like the kind of hurtful feedback that inspires people toward self-reflection and improvement. I think it makes a bad problem worse. As a 19yo I would not have been able to take that reaction productively onboard. I would have started acting out even worse.", "You\u2019re not listening. Nowhere did I say she shouldn\u2019t have been shut down. I said the opposite. I don\u2019t know what her technically being his responsibility or not has to do with being unnecessarily cruel in shutting her down.", "^This. They abandoned their child to be raised by someone not physically old enough to be Alexa's parent who likely was either in their final year of college or had just graduated and got their first full-time job. WTF.\n\nAlexa needs so. much. therapy. The abandonment issues, the inability to create healthy and appropriate relationships, the negative attention seeking behavior... and that's just what's clear as day from a Reddit post. It might be a good bet that Alexa initially decided to fail in school so that her parents would come and get her and take her home. Except they didn't. No matter how badly Alexa did or behaved. What must that have done to her?\n\nOP, you're NTA for shutting down her come-on and letting her know you not only don't have romantic feelings for her, but that you don't have positive feelings for her either. That will hopefully be a wakeup call for her that she cannot continue through life like this and expect happiness or success.\n\nBut Y T A for essentially being her stepdad for *years*, her only day-to-day paternal figure, without actually stepping up to that responsibility. There's nothing in this post that shows that you intervened more than the bare minimum, and in doing so you failed a child that was at least partially under your care and who clearly became deeply attached to you (even if she's misinterpreting that attachment now).  *Get her some help.*", "Yeah obviously. Academics are very important to my in laws and Alexa is an unbearable fuckup while my wife worked hard and did amazing.", "I feel bad for his wife. It sounds like she has just been taken advantage of her whole life and it\u2019s her duty to just\u2026deal with her family\u2019s crap, including blatant disrespect.", "She\u2019s 19. She tried to go behind her sisters back with her husband. Harsh is absolutely called for here. FTK", "Just because she\u2019s young doesn\u2019t mean she can say and do whatever she wants", "She\u2019s a young adult not a child she really tried to sleep with her sis husband no way ur saying he shouldn\u2019t have been harsh", "How is anything he said more cruel than her complete betrayal of her sister? She got exactly what was coming to her: the unvarnished truth.", "What happened to Alexa that made them send her to your wife to be her problem?", "She failed elementary school there. Couldn\u2019t keep up with the pressure. My wife\u2019s parents thought that she could come to America since school is easier here. \n\nMy in laws are furious because we were supposed to keep her away from all thoughts of romance to focus on her studies or whatever bs. Honestly, they\u2019ve always had unrealistic standards."]}
