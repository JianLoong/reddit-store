I told her I only put up with her spoiled self to be with my wife and I was annoyed whenever she intruded. Alexa started sobbing and ran out. I told my wife everything and she said I was right to turn her down but didn\u2019t have to be so harsh. She thanked me for being honest. Her parents are furious. I\u2019ve gotten a bunch of weird text messages from what I suspect are alexa\u2019s friends. AITA?\n\nEdit: I would never do anything because Alexa is literally a kid I\u2019ve seen grow up.
