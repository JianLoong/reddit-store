It would be inappropriate for me to see you in any way besides a little sister, and that is exactly how I see you. As a sister . I don't feel the way that you do.

Because most elementary school teachers won't actually give out failing grades because well most elementary teachers are decent people and very few children are that terrible that they actually would warrant such a grade.

You earn your degree in the last two years of school (and that determines your final grade) some people will choose to repeat a year, especially in those last two, because they can tell they won't get a high grade (which used to give you better options for university), it was like 3 people every year at my school, not a huge deal.", "Nobody ever uses it in any other context.

He lived with us for a bit better than a year (it was supposed to be only 6 months).  He stated he needed his own bathroom from the beginning.  Surprised, but not unwilling, I mulled it over and decided to let him use the bathroom that he and my teenage daughter were supposed to share.  She just used ours or the bathroom downstairs.  He obtained a job at Amazon and worked there, doing pretty well.  We allowed him the use of my wife's car for the 40 mile roundtrip.  When my wife was out of town at one point, I had to inform him that no matter what his arrangement with his aunt, I was not doing his dishes. \n\nAfter the first six months, I asked him about his plans and he stated he would be staying until he went to law school in the fall.  Thinking maybe he spoke with my wife, I took that in and moved on.  He hadn't, but we weren't just going to kick him out.  Long story short, I held my tongue.

However, OP's wife aside, this is a bad situation. Alexa is going after her older sister's husband. Does she like him better because he never had to act as a parent all those years? When big sister was trying to keep her in line, and Alexa was resisting? Now she has a crush, and wants to break up her sister's marriage?

SIL really should go to therapy and get help, and she owes her sister and OP a huge apology. I would understand if even an apology would not be enough for the relationship to be mended.

She was only a couple of years younger, but the age gap felt much wider because of the way she acted\u2014She seemed to always be involved with drama, didn't care much for school, was spoilt, and I wasn't fond of any of that. I basically just put up with her because she was the friend of a friend (this mutual friend was around a year older than me). I got a bunch of weird messages from her friends shortly after I turned her down, accusing me of 'leading her on' and a bunch of other weird accusations, some of which were antithetical to my response to her confession (such as being into minors, idk that didn't make much sense to me because I rejected her).\n\nI was much more polite than OP was, but I got a similar reaction along with the kid attempting to continue a friendship (I was pretty much like, \"are you joking? After this fallout?\"), I kind of wish I did admit to her that I never liked her and only put up with her for our mutual friend, might have been excessive but at least she'd have known where I stood with her.\n\nI know from that experience that Alexa is bad news, OP, and maybe needed a cold harsh dose of reality and 'brutal honesty' to get the message through to her. It's good you told your wife what happened, she deserves to know what her sister attempted behind her back. I would not be comfortable alone with her, if I were you.

You are a relative, and it would be completely inappropriate. It will never happen.\" If feeling kind, one could add \"There are many great people out there, and I'm sure you will find someone closer to your own age who is a good match.\"\n\nThe OP didn't need to tell his niece how much he hates her and finds her annoying.

This kid has gotten away with everything because he's sister isn't her mother, and she's learned that she can get whatever she wants if she just keeps pushing .  \n\nDepending on your relationship with their parents, you should probably tell their mother too, so the kid can't lie about it and screw things up worse.
