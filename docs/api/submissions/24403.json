My roommate Scott is pretty cool and we\u2019ve met a few times over the summer. He is Jewish and I am catholic. We both aren\u2019t like religious nuts but we do our best to follow the faith. We have both said that we appreciate that about eachother. \n\nWhen we moved in, I noticed he had a Star of David on a cloth above his desk. I thought that was pretty cool. No qualms here. I have a smallish crucifix (maybe 8 inches tall) that I put up above my dresser on my side of the room. \n\nWell Scott has a problem with it. He doesn\u2019t like the \u201cdead guy\u201d on a piece of wood and it kinda freaks him out. He asked me if I would take it down and get a different catholic thing to hang up. One, I don\u2019t want to spend money on something, and two, my grandpa (who has since died) bought me this when I had my confirmation years ago so it means something to me. But Scott says this makes him uncomfortable and he finds it disturbing and creepy. I didn\u2019t like that he called it creepy but I didn\u2019t push back on that. \n\nAll I told him was that if he wants it down, he has to take down the Star of David. I said if I can\u2019t have my religious piece than neither can he. He said that a Star is much different because it\u2019s just that, and not a disturbing image. I told him I don\u2019t give a shit. Crucifix comes down than the star comes down, or else it\u2019s not coming down. \n\nSome friends we\u2019ve made on our floor who are not catholic take his side because of the whole dead guy with some blood thing. There\u2019s a girl I made friends with who is catholic and she agrees that if I can\u2019t hang mine he can\u2019t hang his.

Sounds fair to me.", "NTA\n\nYour religious symbol could be a middle finger and it wouldn't matter. If one goes up, all of them can go up.\n\nYou didn't decide that the crucifix was the Catholic symbol, it just is. \n\nAnd honestly, it is just a wooden figurine and he's being a big girls' blouse about it.", "NTA - He can't tell you what religious symbol you have is appropriate or not.  All or nothing here is right.  Either his comes down with yours or both stay.  That's it.", "NTA . It\u2019s a common depiction of your faith ll , if roommate is allowed to have theirs in view so you are as well . Seems like they are trying to force their religious beliefs on yourself . You should not have to compromise and", "YTA and I\u2019ll tell you why. You mostly likely don\u2019t know this, so I will explain. I went to catholic school for my entire education. I learned catholic doctrine, went to church twice a week, read the Bible and received confirmation. Catholicism, at its very core, it\u2019s anti-Semitic. That might feel like I\u2019m attacking your faith, but the history of the Catholic Church engaging in anti-Semitism is very clear. The crucifix, specifically depicting the torture of Jesus, is a reminder to Christians who killed Jesus and MANY Catholics blame Jews. The Pope was instrumental during the Holocaust. Fascist leaders in Italy, Spain, and Portugal who ordered Jews to be killed were Catholic. You might not understand the implications of your demands, but your roommate does on some level. And yes, crucifixes are creepy, they\u2019re literally a depiction of torture. TORTURE OF A JEWISH PERSON! I find it very strange that anyone would want to see that anywhere, to be honest. This might get downvoted, but I think it\u2019s extremely important to be honest about the history of Catholics demonizing Jews, especially in their roll in killing Jesus, and how hysteria against Jews is continued primarily by Christians including Catholics. A cross should suffice, no? It\u2019s the same message just with out a dead man hanging from a wooden cross. You say you\u2019re not a religious nut, so don\u2019t be one. The Star of David belongs to Jews and Christians. If you\u2019re a child of God, if you really care for your roommate, get over yourself and take down the crucifix. It\u2019s not going to help you hook up either, I promise you that.", "NTA", "YTA- please hear me out.  \n\nYou\u2019re playing tit for tat.  If it was incredibly important to you, you wouldn\u2019t be willing to take it down at all.  You feel his asking is \u201cunjust\u201d and will only remove it if he removes his.  I agree, this is \u201cfair\u201d but is certainly not the key to reasonable adult behavior.  \n\nIf the issue is funds, discuss it with him and explain that it\u2019s your symbol, it has meaning in both a religious sense and from a familial perspective.  See what he thinks, reasonably.  Seeing a crucified Jesus can be off-putting; especially for Jewish folks who have grown up hearing of how they \u201ckilled Jesus.\u201d\n\nJust my 2 Pennies.", "YTA... \n\nYour religion chose a dead man hanging on a cross as a huge symbol. Other religions are not required to accept this as no other reason in the world would make hanging such an image ok. The catholics chose this for a reason. You are just falling into believing it is normal because you were raised around it. \n\nDo I think your roomate is being a bit ridiculous? Perhaps. However hey I want to hang a man dieing over here is not normal under any other circumstance. So his discomfort is viable even if not fully believeable. You get to deal with what your religion chose.", "You're both religious pricks. \n\nESH", "YTA here. \n\nLet\u2019s take the religion out of it. He has a geometric shape. You have a guy dying from torture. It\u2019s gruesome.\n\nLet\u2019s put religion back in. He gets to see someone of his religion being tortured daily (Jesus was Jewish). You get to see an image that is not incompatible with your faith. \n\nSurely, as a very devout religious person, you have something else that can go up to remind you of your faith. A prayer candle. A saint\u2019s icon. A plain cross. You could print out something for the cost of a single piece of paper to put up. You could ask around at your church if anyone would be willing to lend you a plain cross. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have literally anything else to symbolize your faith, and you just put it up because he had his star up (which is what this sounds like - a religious tit for tat) you\u2019re being really uncomfortable right now and I think you need to examine why his Star of David made you feel like you needed to put up Catholic defenses.", "NTA.  Fair is fair.", "NTA. It represents your faith and has sentimental value.  If you put it up just to bother him, that would be different.  Religious views need to be respected even if you don't agree with them.", "YTA. Can you not put it somewhere he can't see it? Seeing a representation of someone being tortured to death is reasonable to be disturbed by. A star is not comparable in the disturbing images category.", "ESH. Your roommate should have expected this when he was open to religious signs in the first place. But then, the \"catholic\" equivalent of the Star of David would be the bare cross, which makes more sense.\n\nBut if it's really a point of conflict, you could just take them both down, it sounds like the fairest way to go about it.", "A crucifix is as religious as a Star of David.  Anyone will agree with that statement.\n\nIt's also sentimental and a decoration to you, given it was a gift from your late grandpa.\n\nIt's a little ironic that this could be an opportunity to bring you both together across religions but instead it has divided you.  Religious (or at least semi-religious) folk are harder and harder to find at your age, and there's a lot of common cause between faiths that you both can take advantage of.  Sadly he's using it to divide you in the pettiest of ways.\n\nNTA:  He started it.\n\nTo OP's friends:  spare me the faux morality and euphemisms.", "NTA\nI assume your crucifix isn't overly visual, like bloody, overly detailed wounds etc.", "YTA. You could buy a cross, so that you can keep your faith and he won't get disturbed.\n\nIt's possible he has a fear of blood or something, rather than a religion issue.\n\nAFAIK, crosses are used by catholics. If I'm wrong correct me.", "Definitely NTA.  If you want to, you can be petty and say that star is the reason that man died on the cross in the first place (though I wouldn\u2019t recommend it).  That crucifix is as important to you as that star is important to him, it\u2019s not fair for him to tell you to take it down while he keeps his up.  Fair is fair.", "Aah, good old religion...bringing people together since the age of the dinosaurs smh \ud83e\udd96\ud83e\udd95\ud83d\ude16", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine. Make it either both or none.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr - if you want: Goolge for an exppensive cross, and tell him: For 300$ you can get an equally beautiful one with just the cross to accomodate him - if HE pays for it, you will accept to hang that instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen you can tell every guest: \"this is here, because my roommarte insisted to buy it for me to have it there\". - He will have to learn to LOVE that story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd If he refuses, you can say: I TRIED to accomodate him.", "You cannot compare your crucifix to his star because the problem here is not religion at all. 8 inches cross is pretty big so the jesus on it is probably pretty big as well and while I think he is overreacting you are very petty. Do you really want to die on this hill AND ruin your comfort? If you start a feud now you will never be able to relax in your own room, is it a hill worth dying on?", "I'ma say soft YTA, hear me out, it seems the primary problem isn't the religious item, but rather the dead guy hanging from it. As a person that grew up in a home with it, it's scary at times when you see it at night or from the corner of your eye. I know you don't want to but get another item without the dead on it, use that instead, if he has beef with it, you'll know it's not the dead guys it's the religious. \n\nI know it's sentimental, so I would say to store it in a safe place and use it for somewhere that is more private like your first apartment by yourself or home.", "Kid is flunking math so he transfers to a Catholic school.

I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole unless he keeps pushing. I think it\u2019s very fair that you say if you take yours down he takes his down.", "NTA, but perhaps you should take it up with your RA or housing instead of just telling him \"if I can't have mine then you can't have yours. I don't give a shit\", because that doesn't bode well for any other future conflicts.  \n\n\nOr just ask for a room transfer.", "NTA, but time to compromise.  Can you hang up a rosary instead?", "NTA\nSimple tell him you will leave it and have no need to discuss further. \nIf he wants to engage dorm authorities or the like that would be the next step.", "NTA.  It's sensitive territory being religious, but both of you have your rights to express as you want.  The best solution would be a compromise - if he is willing to purchase a new one for you, that seems to be cooperation from both you.  Maybe something to suggest?", "Star of David is also christian symbol. Just get one too", "NTA.\n\nIf he doesn't like it, too fucking bad.", "YTA, little bit\n\nAs a very religious Non-Cathlic Christian I have always have a problem with crusifics too. Jesus on the cross is only half the story, His death only isn't what saves us, it's His death AND resurection. If it wasn't for the resurection part He would be no different than Moses or Elisah IMO.\n\nAlso the story of the Cross is a very grusume one. There is a reason the Passion of The Christ movie was rated R. And even as a Christian who believes and who the symbolism is so very important to. That image of a HUMAN DYING is still disturbing, espically if the craftsmanship is any good. \n\nAlso being Jewish goes beyound faith it is an ethnic group as well. An ethinic group that has been hunted to the brink of anahliation more than once. The star of david was used to identify jews in nazi occupied countries during WWII. Where they were then rounded up like cattle and killed during what we now call the holocoust or did you not pay attention in history class. \n\nAnd with the new wave of antisemitism here recently having a public display of the star of david is borderline down right dangerous. \n\nEven taking religion and history out of the equation. Two interlocking equallaterial triangles forming a hexigon versus a dead HUMAN on a torture device, which one is safer?. And it's not like Christianity doesn't have embloms and symbols that are more palatable. You are Cathlic you guys have over 10,000 saints, and you have roseries. And while the crusifix does tend to seperate Cathlics from Protestants I don't think that delienation is really your concern. \n\nYou said you had it hanging, could you maybe get a stand of some kind and set it up where he only sees the cross and not Jesus on it. But I also don't know if that is even possible as I haven't seen ya'll's room or the crusifix. And I understand the sentimentallity of the thing as I have many things in my college appartment that were given by now descesed loved ones.\n\nEdit: Scott doesn't want you to not have representations of your faith in the dorm, just not a crusifix. And again I haven't seen it but depending on the craftsmanship they can be very creepy.\n\nMy dad was a pastor, he is now deseased. And some years ago someone gave him a bust of Jesus and the way the eyes were carved and painted they followed you around the room. Always freaked me out. After he passed and we were cleaning out his church office I made my mom leave it for the new pastor because of how disturbing I found it. \n\nAlso everyone please pardon my spelling errors my phone is messed up.", "YTA, you could put up a cross, without the Jesus, it would still be a religious item but without the disturbing imagery or a dead body and blood. Its a shared space and neither of you should be uncomfortable, he is made uncomfortable by the image of a dead body and blood, not the religious aspect.", "NTA, but I think bringing more peers into the situation is a bad idea. I would highly suggest going to your RA if you have one. I work in higher ed and for a while worked in new student transitions. For some people, their first semester of college is the first time they are with people from different backgrounds, including different religions. Your RA will help you two talk through the situation as an unbiased party and try to come to a resolution. If they can't, they can likely move one of you to a different room so you each can hang up your symbols.", "NAH\n\nYou both have valid points. \n\nAdditionally they are both in your own rooms I assume so that should be your personal space for you to do with that what you wish.\n\nI will sympathize with your roommate as I don't know how gory this cross actually is. \n\nIn my eyes you wouldn't be an AH but you are causing conflict when it could be easily resolved. \n\nSometimes we do something because of respect for others. Find another cross without gory details and hang that up.", "Sounds fair to me!", "Exactly this. OP could've had a cross or even rosary beads but instead chose a depiction of the viscious torturing and murdering of a Jewish man.", "This is advanced stupid right here. Take your victim Olympics somewhere else.", "I will talk to him again about it. I don\u2019t want to take it down at all, but I would to keep the peace between us.

OP is definitely NTA.", "I thought a crucifix was mainly used by Catholics and cross used by Christians?", "I think these fellows are sharing a dorm room.", "Yes, a simple cross is much different than a dead body image.\n\nThe roommate isn't asking him to get rid of the gory cross, just not have it in the common area.", "But your roommate is not saying you can't have religious symbols period, you admit they are fine with you having a religious symbol. The issue is this specific symbol with blood and gore. \n\nThe star of david and a crucifix are not the same thing. The star of david would be more along the lines of a cross without jesus on it. \n\nI get that it is sentimental to you, but can you hang it some where you can see it, but it is out of the way in general. Like inside a closet door. You can see it daily but it is out of sight for your roommate. Place a different religious symbol up in full view, like a cross.", "Thank you! A cross would have the same meaning with out a dead Jewish man on a torture device.", "If you\u2019d take it down to keep the peace why not just\u2026 do that?", "You could view taking it down as an act of charity, especially if he is willing to allow any other religious symbol that doesn't involve a body, he's not being hypocritical. \n\nThink of it this way, you have the chance now to give him a good impression of Catholics or a bad one. You can show him that Catholics care about the people around them and take their well-being into account, and reach a kind of compromise, or you could show him that Catholics think that legalism is more important than charity. Personally, as a fellow Catholic I would encourage you to make this an act of charity, and this also gives you a chance to look for a symbol or an image that might be outside of your typical experience so far. You could do a plain cross, a Jerusalem cross, or maybe a picture or an icon of something besides the crucifixion.", "This isn't about religion. Get over it. The crucifix was chosen as a bloody symbol to garner attention and even sympathy. If his roomate has zero problem with a cross but does with a crucifix it isn't about religion. It's about a man being tortured to death and it being symbolized forever in statue or picture form. A man literally being hung up to starve, bleed, and dehydrate to death.", "Because you need it to show", "They need to be respected because everyone has the right to follow whatever religion they choose.
