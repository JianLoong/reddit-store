He just called my name in the message with no context. Me, being anxious about those kinds of texts, replied asking what\u2019s up. The conversation went like this:\n\nCousin: are you free this May 31st?\n\nMe: why? What\u2019s up?\n\nCousin: i need someone to pick me up at the airport. Also i need you to accompany me to get my passport fixed.\n\nMe: sorry I\u2019m not free that time, it\u2019s my exam week (I\u2019m in college)\n\nCousin: alright then just send your address and I\u2019ll take a taxi\n\n*For context, my parents are renting an apartment for me near my campus. It\u2019s not like the usual apartment in other countries. It functions like a dormitory and visitors are not usually allowed to stay overnight. By this time I got confused why he asked for my address.\n\nMe: why? Are you planning on staying here?\n\nCousin: yes, I\u2019ll stay for one night and get a flight home in the morning.\n\nMe: I can\u2019t help you, i have exams that week, I need to study. \n\nCousin: okay OP\n\n*Now this might be where I am an asshole. I got so irritated by the way he asked me so I scolded him.*\n\nMe: you should\u2019ve asked me before deciding that you\u2019re gonna stay at my place. It just seemed like you weren\u2019t planning on telling me if I didn\u2019t asked. I would\u2019ve let you stay if I wasn\u2019t busy but the way you asked me was not good. Next time ask me first before deciding that you were gonna stay at my apartment.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t seen my messages yet. I kinda feel guilty honestly but my bf assured me that my cousin was wrong for the way he asked. It just seemed like he was demanding my time. My bf told me not to send the last part but I was so annoyed that I sent it.
