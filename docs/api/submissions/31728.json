I did not know that they where still there, so he had to be snooping around. Offcourse i understand, that it is distressing to find pictures like that, but now he is positive that I still have feelings for my ex, even though i really fon\u2019t have. He is calling me disgutting, manipulating, and says that the only chance we have moving forward, is if I come crawling back for forgiveness. I am hurt by his namecalling, and don\u2019t think I deserve it. He has a habit of being very jelaous and suspicious of many things I do, even though I would never dream of doing anything to hurt him.\nBut now I am starting to doupt myself.

Do not continue to waste your time in this relationship. *His behavior will only get worse - it will not get better.* NTA", "NTA, and I can only advise you do the opposite of what he wants: turn around, and never look back.", "Thank you lucky stars he broke up with you. He sounds awful, and if you do go back he\u2019s going to trot this out anytime he wants to make you dance and grovel some more. \n\nOnly immature controlling assholes snoop through your devices and start demanding apologies for you having 10-year old pictures of exes.", "NTA.\n\nThere\u2019s no rule that you have to delete old pictures when a relationship ends. (The only possible exception is anything inappropriate to be shown in a public setting, but since you didn\u2019t know you had these photos I\u2019m giving you a pass here.)\n\nYou\u2019re much better off without a snooping, jealous, gaslighting prick of an ex in your life. You did nothing wrong here.", "NTA. If your ex exhibited jealous behavior, he was eventually going to find something to confirm his suspicions and make it an issue. I have old photos of past boyfriends, not because I'm still in love with them or have feelings for them but because they're just a part of my life story. When I'm old and flipping through my photo albums, I want to remember all of it and reminisce, but that's just me. Also, anyone who thinks they're  justified in making a demand that you come \"crawling back \" probably isn't the best person to be with, especially after the name calling.", "NTA. He's the manipulative one. You have no obligation to delete pictures of an ex. He was part of your life and those memories are still worth having. It doesn't suggest at all that you still have feelings for him.", "NTA. People have different philosophies about how to go about memories with exes. For some, the may still enjoy the memories even though the feelings are gone. This guy sounds like a controlling, insecure butthead. Run.", "NTA. First, wtf was he doing going through your computer? Huge red flag! Second, don't give another thought to what this manipulative nonsense this guy has said about you. Do not engage! Make a clean break.", "NTA\n\nHe's insecure and jealous  (and,  obviously, didn't get past HS mentality). He's treated you like this because he *knows* you deserve better.", "NTA unless you crawl back to him.", "NTA - Please do not go back to this asshole! He doesn\u2019t deserve you.", "NTA please be careful of this specimen, he's the one being manipulating. You do not have to crawl anywhere, you need to walk away proudly and never look back anymore.", "NTA\n\nAny person who thinks you shouldn't have had a life before you met them deserves to be in the trash.", "NTA.  Let this guy go, it's too exhausting to have to deal with this shit.", "This dude is crazy do not go crawling back, wave goodbye", "You better not ever crawl back to no man regardless of the situation. Respect yourself", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re better off without him. He\u2019s fine you a favour don\u2019t get back together with him. This type of behaviour only escalates. Do you want to be miserable with a suspicious boyfriend for the next couple of years? Move on, you are better off. Be happy and find someone that makes you happy not miserable. No one should try to make you crawl back to them when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "NTA. \n\nIt's not like he found some secret folder with photos and current photos you found online that you're storing and it's some stalker files. They're old. \n\nI'm glad he's an ex boyfriend. He's insecure and taking it out on you like you're cheating on him or something. How was this manipulative? What would you be asking for forgiveness for? He did you a huge favor by showing you who he is and it's time to leave him in the rear view mirror.", "He was *looking* for a reason to leave. He found one. \n\nNTA", "I agree with the tell him to fuck off route or tell him to grow up", "NTA he is the issue here. He is snooping and mistrustful. He might even be cheating and projecting. If he wants to ruin the relationship let him and move on.", "NTA", "Don't give in, NTA\n\nBut whats likely to happen when you say no is he's gonna flip around and suddenly be begging for forgiveness and saying he's sorry, its what abusers do. Assuming you actually have a spine and tell him no, don't be fooled by the flip after", "Re-read your own post. Are you really doubting yourself ?Do you think he deserves you ? Do you think anyone should crawl for forgiveness and have any expectation of any kind of healthy relationship after ? It never works, and it's not even remotely worth it in this case.\n\nNTA, stay away and tell him too if he comes back.", "NTA don't go back to him you deserve better.", "NTA : your boyfriend is abusive. \n\nHe had no rights to snoop though your computer. That is a clear violation of your privacy. \n\nHe has no rights to decides how you deal with the memories of your past. He does not get to tell you what pictures you can and cannot keep, especially if they are not in your and his immediate environnment : that is much too controlling, and control is a form of abuse. I could understand him asking to not have a picture of your ex on the wall or on the nighstand for example, but in your computer ? What next, are you supposed to burn all your old photos ? \n\nYou have done nothing wrong OP, his reaction was way over the top and unwarranted. Do not ask for forgiveness : this is a dangerous, abusive man. \n\nYou had a life before him, and you have the right to keep memories of it.  Even if he was right about the feelings, that would not matter or justify his reaction, because we are allowed to have feelings for people from our past ! Be it friends or exes, feelings are not something we control : how we act on those feelings is what matter. In this case, you have not done a SINGLE THING that makes you guilty of the insults he threw at you. \n\nHis jealousy is irrationnal and dangerous and you are (were) not safe in this relationship. Please OP, protect yourself : he has shown you who he is, believe him and do not let him come back. It's a good thing he's now an ex.", "NTA. I understand that it can cause him jealousy or whatever (you don't want a reminder of the past of your lover... ). But, it is part of life, so, as we say in Portuguese \"accept because it hurts less\" and I think it is beautiful.", "NTA, run away and don't look back", "NTA. But your boyfriend is. Jealousy just means he doesn\u2019t trust you. You don\u2019t need that kind of negativity, and abuse, in your life. You deserve better.", "Who the hell cares if you have pictures of past partners. I presume they aren't nudes. Your (most recent) ex is a controlling irrationally jealous arsehole, and you are well rid of him. NTA", "NTA \n\nDo not go back. Other fishes in the sea.", "NTA but he is, I have been with my husband over 20 years. I know I have photos of exes somewhere around here and that he has photos of his exes we have moved several times over the years and these are physical copies not just digital and I promise neither of us is harboring feelings for those exes or jealous over some pictures. The snooping alone is alarming behavior but the insane reaction is not okay and you\u2019re not going to be able to have a healthy relationship with someone like that. Everyone has a past and in order to have a relationship with someone you have to accept that and realize that is part of who they are now and that if they hadn\u2019t had those experiences they may not have been ready to have a real relationship with you jealousy doesn\u2019t belong in a relationship if he doesn\u2019t think he can trust you then you shouldn\u2019t be together. To be honest this sounds like a way to shame and control you. Do not go begging for forgiveness you did absolutely nothing wrong.", " Not defending the bf, he sounds like a moron,  just stating a fact that I'm sure your computer is not 10 years old, so at some point you downloaded or saved the pictures to a newer device for a reason....", "lets be real. you didnt forget and yes you are TA. your boyfriend deserves better.", "ESH. It\u2019s not cool of you to keep pictures of your ex on your social media (even unknowingly). You should have been more careful.
