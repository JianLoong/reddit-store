The wedding was over and you did not steal the spotlight from your cousin.", "NTA, and I can see why your family weren\u2019t involved. No one can claim a wedding week or month that no one else can do anything in. You didn\u2019t even go to their wedding! Your family have demonstrated why you are low contact.\n\nNTA, and congratulations!", "NTA Had you proposed at a bridal shower, wedding event, or anything that was supposed to be about them, it would be different. Showing up to their wedding with a newly minted engagement would be different. They're already married. It's not about them any more.\n\nEdit: And congratulations on your impending nuptials.  :)", "NTA\n\nIf it hadn\u2019t been this, they would have bitched that you proposed on \u201cthis, they say of my daughters goldfishes half birthday\u201d or something. This is just more evidence that you\u2019re making the right choice with distance.\n\nNo couple owns the wedding year. You didn\u2019t propose at the wedding, they are just AHs", "Why to people feel such entitlement to time surrounding their event that isn't acutllay realated to the event. I think most events, once over are not longer yours to lord over people. I'm so sick of birthday months, or wedding season, or even years. It can be all about you but you can't hold everyone you've ever met to this unrealistic standard. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\n**Three days later.**\n\nBecky decrees there will be no new engagements for anyone she's ever met until she, inevitably, announces her impending divorce. And not after that, either because she's engaged, again.", "NTA it\u2019s not like you proposed at their wedding or their event or anything. I\u2019m curious what they think is a reasonable amount of time. I don\u2019t think it really matters they would have found one excuse or another to start drama.", "NTA. The happy couple gets a **day** to celebrate their wedding. Once that day is over, its over. It doesn't matter if you were on good terms with them or not, you would be fine if you proposed to your fiancee the day after, because the wedding was over.\n\nIt's like you said - your family is insanely dramatic. They are making drama most likely because the wedding is over and they are bored.", "Obviously your family has zero going on in their lives. What would be the next excuse? You can\u2019t propose now because it was great grandma Bertha\u2019s wedding anniversary. It\u2019s two days before July 4th. The dog had babies last week. It\u2019s the anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic? NTA", "NTA. Their argument is stupid.", ">So, AITA for proposing to my fianc\u00e8 3 days after a wedding I hadn't attended?\n\nWhatever you do,  don't tell your cousin that other people got married on the same day she did.

I can guarantee you that you\u2019re not the only people to have gotten engaged that day. Is Becky the engagement police!?", "NTA.\n\nPeople shouldn't propose at someone else's wedding that they are attending but that's about it. \n\n3 days after their wedding, not even at anything related to their wedding, you are fine. Your family is clearly insanely dramatic as you describe. \n\nFocus on your new family as you move forward with your own wedding.", "Lmao. NTA. Your cousin gets 1 day for her wedding and she had it. It\u2019s 3 days later I can promise we\u2019re all sick of hearing about it now.", "WTF. NO NTA. Your family is fucked up and tell them to kick rocks. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding.", "NTA\n\nThe world doesn't revolve around Becky and her wedding.", "NTA.", "NTA. You NEVER propose at someone else\u2019s wedding, but anytime after that is fair game. You waited 3 days which is enough time.

Same age range, you see happiness and romance or whatever. Aunties wandering around saying \"it'll be your turn next!\"  It naturally raises the topic of conversation. Even if it was entirely coincidence, your family sounds unnecessarily dramatic. NTA"]}
