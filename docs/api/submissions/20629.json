Lots of pictures were taken, and it was just close friends and family. The day came to a sudden stop when I had a notification that I had been  tagged in a post from MIL letting everyone know the gender of our baby, I have to admit this angered me, I was hoping that me and my fiance could make that announcement ourselves first, but it wasn't even the end of the day and I was receiving congrats message from random people. I expressed my concern to my fiance, and he said he'd talk to her.\nWe're now 30 weeks into the pregnancy and decided to get a 4D scan to see our precious baby, and sent the photos to close family before we put any posts up, and she again made the post before me or my fiance could.\nWe've now had to sit her down and tell her that she has stole these moments from us by making these announcements first, this is our first baby and its those moments we can never have returned too us. I have made a warning that if this continues where announcements are being made before we have made them, then I will not tell her when her grandchild arrives, and that she can find out through social media. She's now become very upset and said that we are overreacting,  aita in this situation?\nEDIT - it's my first time posting on reddit, so I admit some information has been missed. I apologise\nFirstly, I have family that live abroad, that I would have  loved to have made these kinds of announcements too before MIL made the announcements public herself.\nThe second time she made the announcement at the gender reveal party we expressed she shouldn't of done that and that any pregnancy related announcments we would like to make ourselves in our own time and on our own terms. SO did express to MIL as well multiple times about our feelings on the matter.\nI should also mention that when we shared photos from scans we asked everyone not to share until we had managed to share them ourselves she justified sharing these as 'I didn't tag you so it doesn't count' kind of attitude towards us being upset about the announcement being made before us again.\nI would also like to express that I did think there was a line with MILs oversharing. She has other grandchildren from her eldest daughter, and she never made these announcements before her daughter did", "created_utc": 1687781616, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jfol2/aita_for_telling_mil_that_i_wont_tell_her_when_i/", "score": 3374, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It makes perfect sense that you and your fianc\u00e9 wanted to enjoy the pleasure of sharing significant news about your unborn child on your own. It's understandable to be frustrated that your MIL was eager to share the news on social media before you had a chance to do so.\n\nIt was good to let her know how you felt and what was on your mind at the time. She needs to know how valuable these times are to you and your fianc\u00e9 and how important it is for you both to be able to spend them with your loved ones at your own pace and in your own way. You are defending those priceless experiences that can never be recreated by stating your expectations while setting boundaries.\n\nWhile your advice to not tell her directly about the grandchild's arrival may come across as harsh, it serves as a reminder of the significance it is that your desires be respected. Your MIL may be upset, which is normal, but she has to understand how her behaviour has influenced your experience and feelings.\n\nIt would be beneficial for you, your fianc\u00e9, and your MIL to have an open and sincere discussion about expectations and limitations when it comes to sharing news on social media going ahead. You can work towards a solution that respects your goals while simultaneously permitting your MIL to be part in the process by building common ground and understanding each other's viewpoints.\n\nIt's imperative to focus your emotional health and the wonderful moments you've been anticipating because this is your first child. Keep your priorities clear and don't be afraid to ask for help from your fianc\u00e9 and other family members during this difficult time.", "NTA at all!\n\nAnd I want you to know, in case it helps clarify and bring you some extra feeling of validation, that I'm speaking as someone who WAS that \"over-excitable relative\" who was a little too eager to share things, once upon a time.\n\nMy older sister was the first (and only) in the immediate family to have babies, and the rest of us were all OUTRAGEOUSLY excited to be aunties and grandparents. But I am autistic and was undiagnosed at the time, which I mention so you understand that even though I was in my late 20s, I struggled with understanding boundaries and social rules, and because I didn't have a diagnosis, none of my loved ones really knew either (until it was too late and I'd done something stupid) that they had to explain to me explicitly that just because I was emotionally invested in things didn't mean that they were \"mine\" for sharing . . . even if I meant it out of love and excitement. \n\nAgain, in my case, thank goodness I didn't share anything genuinely private like the baby's name or that my sister was pregnant before she had a chance. But I did share photos of my nieces without permission, and REALLY upset my sister. Lucky for me, she is very understanding, and after a couple of good talks, I understood that my excitement about being an aunt did not give me the right to make decisions about the babies' privacy . . . and I apologized and stopped sharing. They are now young adults and have more siblings, NONE of whose pictures I share EVER, anywhere, without asking their mom first. \n\nMy rather long-winded point is: your MIL doesn't even have that excuse of genuinely not understanding. At this point in her life she has been socialized enough to comprehend that none of this situation is \"hers\", even if she is very excited to be a nan . . . and therefore she does not get to make ANY of the decisions around sharing information, no matter how emotionally invested she feels. And I do get her investment (my niblings are as close as I will ever get to having kids of my own); but it's still not her place. She gets to ENJOY this process, and your child. She does not get to make decisions or share things without checking in with you. About EVERYTHING. Every time. This is your show to run. \n\nIn fact, while I fully support you putting her on an \"information diet\", perhaps that's a better way to explain it to her - kind but firm, rather than angry, so she can't even claim to anyone that you are punishing her. Tell her that you love her, and you understand and appreciate how deeply invested she is in the new baby's arrival. . . but that until she can show you that she understands that it is not for her to MAKE DECISIONS about how things are shared around this baby, you simply cannot share things with HER. It isn't a punishment, it's a response to her own behaviour.\n\nThis is already way too long, so I'll leave it here.

You can involve her as much or as little as you want, I recommend cutting contact down a bit and putting her on an information diet. Also, look into the grey rock method of communication.

Yes, she's the child's nanny, and I have no doubt she'll be a great nan, but does that mean I have to miss out on announcing my child's firsts? Whether that's on social media or face to face?", "My family who live abroad live in different time zones from what I do, so how would you suggest an all in one announcement? I don't have the option to facetime them at 3 o'clock in the morning, is it too much to ask that I and my fianc\u00e9 make these announcements ourselves? It's not been publicly announced when a select few are the only ones who know right? I still had to think of people who couldn't make it, who I hadn't been able to contact yet, but I was busy soaking in the moment and I wasn't on my phone. Do you suggest that I should've picked my phone up straight away once the balloon popped like MIL did?", "It's my priorities that I'm thinking about, me and my fiance have a birth plan, and we agreed that when he's here, we're going to want to enjoy him for a while, and not be bombarded with messages from strangers congratulating us whilst I'm in a hospital bed, probably exaughsted from labour.

Don't you think those kinds of announcements should be made by the parents of the child though? I mean I have family abroad that I hadn't even managed to tell yet before the announcement went public. I'm not sure what clicks are?", "I should of said in my post sorry, it's not about broadcasting to strangers, but I do have family that live abroad that found out before I could make the announcement to them myself. I also don't want any announcements of his arrival being made before I've had the time to enjoy my baby y'know? When she made the announcement about the gender reveal as I stated in the post I was being congratulated by strangers and that bothered me, I don't want that to happen when I'm in a hospital bed spending time with my first born \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "We just didn't want to have to take such drastic measures, I just want her to understand her oversharing has robbed us of little moments that we've been looking forward too for so long.

I can\u2019t help but think that incidents like these as a potential reason for the \u201cvillage\u201d disappearing.", "Your fianc\u00e9 sounds pretty limp around her. HE needs to push back against her and set boundaries, firmly. I would be very clear with him  that you don\u2019t want her to know until after your baby arrives, and after YOU get to announce the arrival.
