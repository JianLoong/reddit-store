Lots of pictures were taken and it was just close friends and family. The day came to a sudden stop when I had a notification that I had been  tagged in a post from MIL letting everyone know the gender of our baby, I have to admit this angered me, I was hoping that me and my fiance could make that announcement ourselves first, but it wasn't even the end of the day and I was receiving congrats message from random people.

Does he realize his mom is well outside her lane on this?  I sincerely hope so.\n\nAlso, although youre NTA, youre not doing yourself any favors if you stray from the path you chose with informing her.

It makes perfect sense that you and your fianc\u00e9 wanted to enjoy the pleasure of sharing significant news about your unborn child on your own. It's understandable to be frustrated that your MIL was eager to share the news on social media before you had a chance to do so.\n\nIt was good to let her know how you felt and what was on your mind at the time. She needs to know how valuable these times are to you and your fianc\u00e9 and how important it is for you both to be able to spend them with your loved ones at your own pace and in your own way. You are defending those priceless experiences that can never be recreated by stating your expectations while setting boundaries.\n\nWhile your advice to not tell her directly about the grandchild's arrival may come across as harsh, it serves as a reminder of the significance it is that your desires be respected. Your MIL may be upset, which is normal, but she has to understand how her behaviour has influenced your experience and feelings.\n\nIt would be beneficial for you, your fianc\u00e9, and your MIL to have an open and sincere discussion about expectations and limitations when it comes to sharing news on social media going ahead. You can work towards a solution that respects your goals while simultaneously permitting your MIL to be part in the process by building common ground and understanding each other's viewpoints.\n\nIt's imperative to focus your emotional health and the wonderful moments you've been anticipating because this is your first child. Keep your priorities clear and don't be afraid to ask for help from your fianc\u00e9 and other family members during this difficult time.", "NTA at all!\n\nAnd I want you to know, in case it helps clarify and bring you some extra feeling of validation, that I'm speaking as someone who WAS that \"over-excitable relative\" who was a little too eager to share things, once upon a time.\n\nMy older sister was the first (and only) in the immediate family to have babies, and the rest of us were all OUTRAGEOUSLY excited to be aunties and grandparents. But I am autistic and was undiagnosed at the time, which I mention so you understand that even though I was in my late 20s, I struggled with understanding boundaries and social rules, and because I didn't have a diagnosis, none of my loved ones really knew either (until it was too late and I'd done something stupid) that they had to explain to me explicitly that just because I was emotionally invested in things didn't mean that they were \"mine\" for sharing . . . even if I meant it out of love and excitement. \n\nAgain, in my case, thank goodness I didn't share anything genuinely private like the baby's name or that my sister was pregnant before she had a chance. But I did share photos of my nieces without permission, and REALLY upset my sister. Lucky for me, she is very understanding, and after a couple of good talks, I understood that my excitement about being an aunt did not give me the right to make decisions about the babies' privacy . . . and I apologized and stopped sharing. They are now young adults and have more siblings, NONE of whose pictures I share EVER, anywhere, without asking their mom first. \n\nMy rather long-winded point is: your MIL doesn't even have that excuse of genuinely not understanding. At this point in her life she has been socialized enough to comprehend that none of this situation is \"hers\", even if she is very excited to be a nan . . . and therefore she does not get to make ANY of the decisions around sharing information, no matter how emotionally invested she feels. And I do get her investment (my niblings are as close as I will ever get to having kids of my own); but it's still not her place. She gets to ENJOY this process, and your child. She does not get to make decisions or share things without checking in with you. About EVERYTHING. Every time. This is your show to run. \n\nIn fact, while I fully support you putting her on an \"information diet\", perhaps that's a better way to explain it to her - kind but firm, rather than angry, so she can't even claim to anyone that you are punishing her. Tell her that you love her, and you understand and appreciate how deeply invested she is in the new baby's arrival. . . but that until she can show you that she understands that it is not for her to MAKE DECISIONS about how things are shared around this baby, you simply cannot share things with HER. It isn't a punishment, it's a response to her own behaviour.\n\nThis is already way too long, so I'll leave it here.

However, your MIL seems like she's trying to insert herself into you and your partners situation. You can involve her as much or as little as you want, I recommend cutting contact down a bit and putting her on an information diet. Also, look into the grey rock method of communication.

But I will definitely be communicating more about the boundaries we both expect with her in the future thank you \ud83d\ude0a \ud83d\ude4f", "We did express to her after the gender reveal that we would like to make these announcements ourselves before anything goes up, but it seems to have fallen on death ears, maybe I should of communicated alot sooner I get that, thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "They did tell MIL after the gender reveal to stop and she blatantly ignored it with the 4D scans.", "I get that, and I 100% understand my baby will exist out of social media. I think the thing I'm worried about the most is if she were to make the announcement of the baby's arrival before we did would just be frustrating, both me and my fiance have said when he's here we just want to enjoy him and not be bombarded with messages by strangers from her social media, like what happened at the gender reveal before the party was over", "This isn\u2019t breaking news about an accident on the freeway. This is news about their own family that they wish to keep private until they choose to share that information. It shouldn\u2019t be a race to share something on social media.", "When she cannot keep her damn mouth/fingers shut - then she does not get to know immediately. She had 3 times and messed it up 3 times. She will find out about it - but with everyone else on social media. The parents SHOULD have the right to post about the birth of their child before anyone else.", "Thats a very valid point, thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "I would question the idea that this is done without malice. She was asked not to announce on social media until the parents have been able to announce to their own friends and family. She ignored that yet again to share the 4D scan. She knows what she\u2019s doing but doesn\u2019t care. She will 100% post the baby\u2019s arrival before the parents are ready.", "Common courtesy is to wait til the actual parents of the baby publish something first. Something MIL is seriously lacking.", "Its basic manners, she should already know that you don't announce other peoples baby news. That's the job of the parents and the parents alone, unless they have asked you to do it. People should not have to explain that to other grown ups.\n\nGrandma can be as excited as she wants to be privately. But until the parents post announcing the baby news you keep a lid on that excitement.", "I 100% get where you're coming from, but it's not that we're focuses much on the social media side of things, it's just that she's made these announcements before we could, and her friends who are total strangers to me found out before I could let family know that are on my social media who couldn't make it to the reveal because they live in different countries or were tied up with work.  \nI don't mind receiving messages of love and support, but the party wasn't even over and i was being messaged by complete strangers.\nI am absolutley focused on my baby and have been, but I can't help but feel disheartened when we've expressed that we would like to make these sort of announcements first as well, it's our first child that we've been trying for ages to get, and I've been excited about every little aspect even down to making the announcements so I could share those moments with my family and friends who don't live close. I'm not saying I want to cut off my child to their grandma, but we've expressed that once he's here, we just want to enjoy him and not be bombarded with messages if someone posts, and we would like to post the announcement of his arrival on our own terms and in our own time", "I have expressed all my concerns to my partner, he has agreed that she's always been finger friendly when it comes to social media, she does tend to post quite a bit, he has said that it's been an issue in the past, where she's posted stuff about someone else's business and they've told her she needs to stop. I should of made that more clear my apologies \ud83d\ude0a", "OP cares, and very clearly, MIL cares too. Depending how many people you want to tell personally, someone making a post early might take that away from you (and them).", "Well, we just wanted to make those kind of announcements on our own time and on our own terms, same with when baby arrives, I don't want to be bombarded with messages by strangers when I'm in a hospital bed trying to enjoy some time with my own little family. But not everyone thinks this is an issue and I get it \ud83d\ude0a", "All these stealing the moment comments and stealing post from Facebook are kinda sickening. Your about to bring a child into world and people are bothered about who post it first.", "He's expressed to her that we would like to make any pregnancy related posts about the baby first multiple times, I think it's more that she just forgets or doesn't really seem bothered which, I always hoped wasn't the case but I'm not so sure", "We expressed to her multiple times we would like to make the announcements first after she made the first announcement", "Did they? Cause OP told MIL \"if this continues\"", "I feel you so much. It sucks to have to go that route, but it's better doing it sooner than later. Boundaries are important.\n\nPS: congratulations on the pregnancy :)", "I think drastic measures are necessary. Im 28 weeks right now and would be LIVID if my mom or MIL did any of this. You handled it better than I would have lol", "No, OP prefers getting to share important milestones with her loved ones rather than someone else doing it before she gets the chance.", "Explain", "Okay, and she\u2019s respected that. A 4D scan isn\u2019t an announcement.", "My mom is like this. We have a private family iCloud where we post pics of the kids and she\u2019s taken pics off there and sent them to her friends or posted on Facebook. I am pregnant with our third right now and do not feel comfortable with any social media posts announcing my pregnancy or with pics of me pregnant. She gets that now but with my first she kept posting pics of me that I would have to ask her to take down. My cousin and I finally sat her down on a family vacation to be like \u201cwhy is this a constant issue?\u201d. She really didn\u2019t get how public Facebook is or how many people could see what she posted. It turned into a whole lesson about online privacy for my mom and my aunt. I still get pissed about how she uses social media and how she sends pics to her friends, but at least she gets now that I absolutely am not ok with her posting about my pregnancy online.", "Literally I made a picture from a wedding over the weekend my profile picture and didn\u2019t say anything about it because they hadn\u2019t even changed their relationship status or posted anything yet. There\u2019s no reason that someone should be posting things before the couple announcing them posts.", "I don\u2019t know the proper way to cross post except to literally just copy and paste the posts! Haha", "It's never been about the likes, more that MIL is making these announcements before we could but I understand why you would come to that conclusion \ud83d\ude0c", "And she posted the gender after they had already revealed it at the aptly named \u201cgender reveal party\u201d. This is ridiculous, be happy your child has grandparents excited about their arrival.", "I'm sorry to hear that. It sucks when people will literally ruin real life relationships for fake FB ones.", "Death ears, yeah. They're the worst kind. I hate them.", "Anyone else read deatheaters?", "So, you let slide 2 times and didn't do anything, It not death ears if you didn't talk to her. \n\nand the 4D is not a announcement", "NTA\nCompletely agree with you \n\nShe is taking something away from you. It\u2019s not ok to post your news on social media when you have asked her not to and she needs to wait until or if you post something. \n\nDefinitely keep her out of the loop  from now on about baby, or she  will take away birth of your baby announcements too from you as well and post your news to all.\n\nI\u2019d tell her after I posted it on social media myself, so  MIL finds out that way and it might hit home then. \n\nBut also I\u2019d be tempted to give her fake misinformation that she embarrasses herself with about \n\u201cBaby Renaldo who was 13lbs\u201d\n\nI!had a cousin announce the death of my sister on Facebook !!!! \ud83d\ude31when I was still trying to ring round everyone from the hospital  at 11pm at night and had only just got hold if her (adult cousin) for my aunt. It was unbelievably insensitive and not news to share across facebook at that time.  There are some things only certain people get to post.", "Then deactivate your account for awhile.", "Did you tell her it bothered you the first time?", "I disagree. her announcement took you out of the moment bc now you were fielding alerts instead of being fully present. So she did steal that moment.", "Hey, thanks for elaborating. I think that's completely fair, especially since you have friends and loved ones abroad. NTA and I understand where you're coming from a lot better after this comment. I appreciate you taking the time to explain why you feel so strongly. Also, I wish you, and your soon to be baby, all the love and light, health and happiness, the world has to offer. CONGRATULATIONS mama bear \u2764\ufe0f", "Hey, I read your reply and I understand your feelings much better now. I guess... I don't see it as a zero sum game? I don't see how MIL getting some love and attention, actually takes love and attention away from you..?\n\nI hear you, and I recognize that that isn't your issue. My original take was wrong. I apologize.\n\nI DO understand that this is your life and your child, not hers. And you deserve the right and the ability to make those choices your ownself. I respect that. I don't think you are an AH.\n\nI'm so proud of you making a person all by yourself (well... With a LITTLE help \ud83d\ude1c) congrats, mama. You're gonna do just fine.\n\nETA - for the judgement bot, NTA.", "Yea I think you\u2019re in the clear. She def doesn\u2019t seem like she was being malicious on purpose, but she was 10000% being selfish. Good on you for setting the boundary and expressing your needs. Especially since you\u2019ve been trying for six years and she just takes these experiences away from you that SHE HAS ALREADY HAD SINCE SHES HAD KIDS. You are NTA for sure", "Agree after reading OPs replies and learning more about the situation.\n\nMy initial take was wrong.", "Agreed, it's not an announcement, but it was something me and the fiance would of liked to of shared with our family and friends in our own time, and we have expressed that to MIL", "But aren't you making these announcements in real life? I feel like you probably did your gender reveal in real life. Isn't making the announcements in real life what matters? Once you've announced something in person, why should it matter who posts it on social media first? I don't know. We might just value social media differently.", "Did you tell her the first time not to share? Or the second? Or the third?\n\n\nI'd be pissed at her too, but I do think that people tend to have different mindsets, to some extent generational. \n\n\nI know with milestones, I tell my mom \"Don't tell anyone else,\" and she won't, but she's so open with information in general, including her own, that she needs to be told what is/isn't something we want to keep secret.", "We had expressed to her that we would like to make these kind of announcements on our own time and appreciate if she could wait.", "She doesn't how to turn off her phone?", "No problem, it's my first time posting in something like this so I haven't really elaborated information where I should of, sorry \ud83d\ude48 but thank you so much for your kind words \u2764\ufe0f", "Based on what you said, you told her you want to make announcements first. Unless you specifically said she can\u2019t share pictures of your child without your approval, you moved the goalpost on her and are mad at her for not reading your mind.", "Of course these announcements are being made by us in real life, but I have family that live in other countries that couldn't make it to the reveal and i would of liked to of let them know first before any posts or anything would of gone up, and idk, the fact I was receiving congratulations messages from random people off of her social media as well before the party had even ended just bothered me, but yeah absolutely get where you're coming from \ud83d\ude0a", "We told her the second time, which was the gender reveal, the first time she did it I was in two minds because it was a very exciting time for all of us because it was something we'd all longed for, for years", "Then NTA, she should have respected that fact", "Cheers! Hey, if clear, respectful communication isn't working, and you need to petty, then you need to petty! It sounds like you have already tried to be kind. Just remember, she's part of your child's family too. You got this \u2764\ufe0f", "Told her before or after she did it?\n\n\nI disagree with her sharing the stuff, but when you sent out the 4D pics, was there any \"Here are the pics! Don't share them with anyone else until we get to share them with everyone!\"", "We didn't realise she had made the announcement until she did as it was during the party before it had even ended, whilst we were all hugging and crying over baby's gender with family and friends, so it was after she had made the post, and she'd left the party as I'm pretty sure my fiance telling her she shouldn't of made the announcement yet annoyed her but I don't like jumping to conclusions and liked to of think she left because she was tired or something.\nWe did express please don't share until we've managed to share with everyone with the pics as well, but she tried to justify that she didn't tag us and that the announcement was made between her and her friends and that was the final straw for me. I tried to keep calm about the announcements just because I didn't want to stress over something that some people see as small and juvenile :/"]}
