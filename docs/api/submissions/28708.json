{"id": 28708, "submission_id": "175fhy1", "title": "AITA for wanting my mom to quit her home daycare and get a different job?", "selftext": "Since I\u2019ve been born, my moms had her own home daycare. I\u2019m 25. Originally, it was to make more income while she was staying at home with us. We constantly butt heads and I\u2019ve tried to tell her she can make more money doing ANYTHING else. Our family has long outgrown the business, and it has taken a toll on everyone, even my mom. \n\nWhen I was younger, it was good for my sibling\u2019s and I\u2019s social development. When I was 13, my mom would ask me to help with her kids. At first it was just occasional, but then everyday. She needed me to pick up kids from school/stay home with other kids so she could go get more kids. When I said no, it became an argument of that \u2018I didn\u2019t care for the family\u2019 or \u2018I was selfish and never helped out\u2019. I can\u2019t count the times parents would leave their kids past 5pm and I\u2019d be the one who had to watch them because my parents had to take my siblings to their own stuff. There would be times that children would walk in on me naked getting dressed. I also wouldn\u2019t be allowed in my bedroom until 4pm everyday because she puts the kids in my bed for naps. The worst is that because she wants the money, she\u2019ll take kids who are sick (vomiting, bronchitis, etc.) and keep them in our house and in everyone\u2019s beds. When I was 16/17 I said I wanted my own space and I didn\u2019t want kids in my bedroom because it\u2019s my space/privacy. She refused and said this is her business and if I don\u2019t like it I can leave. We would have fights because she would want us to bring our friends over and we never wanted too. I never wanted to bring friends/bfs around screaming children all the time. I also said since this is her job, I wasn\u2019t going to be helping as she uses me constantly and if she wants to utilize me so frequently she has to pay me. She refused and said I was being ungrateful. My brother left when he was 16 as he didn\u2019t agree with her business/wanted his own space. My parents separated around 6 years ago, the home daycare wasn\u2019t the full reason why but My dad worked from home and he couldn\u2019t keep having the kids running around/screaming all day.\n\nI was laid off from my first engineering job which I had for about 1.5yrs. We agreed that a bed/bath can be built in the basement. But I will have to pay for the entire bed/bath because she doesn\u2019t want it.This will cost about $2200. Then pay $300/mo for rent and she claims that it\u2019s too little and since I made more than her when I worked I have to contribute more to the \u2018family\u2019. I told her she\u2019s only getting $300 because I don\u2019t have a job right now and I\u2019m also not going to be contributing to water/hydro/food that she uses for people\u2019s children that she claims on her taxes under her business. She\u2019s kept her rates/child the same for 15 years. with inflation, she can hardly afford anything and barely can save any money. She also works another cleaning job at night. Ive tried teach her and properly educate her on supply/demand,etc. But she doesn\u2019t listen.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve been interviewing for new jobs I\u2019m about 1 month out of work. I ended up getting severe bronchitis from a child who came with it (my mom let them in) and am now bedridden from what the doctor has said. I am very grateful I get to save money and pay something, but my sanity and we\u2019ll being would fly out the window. She is considered low income, she makes around $27,000/year she charges $50 per child per day. She relies on her other jobs, her bfs rent and my rent to even put food on our table. She\u2019s been doing this for 25 years. And her rates haven\u2019t gone up in the past 10. The area of which I\u2019m in is very expensive, no minimum wage job or even a waitress job would cover rent. It\u2019s about $3500+ to live in an apartment and about 2500 to live with a roommate. Somebody called child services or something because my mom had 8 kids in the home when she\u2019s only supposed to have 5. Her business is being suspended. My brother is fighting forest fires and my dad and his gf won\u2019t allow me to move in with them.", "created_utc": 1697034966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175fhy1/aita_for_wanting_my_mom_to_quit_her_home_daycare/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
