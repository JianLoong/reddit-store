I\u2019m 25. Originally, it was to make more income while she was staying at home with us. We constantly butt heads and I\u2019ve tried to tell her she can make more money doing ANYTHING else. Our family has long outgrown the business, and it has taken a toll on everyone, even my mom. \n\nWhen I was younger, it was good for my sibling\u2019s and I\u2019s social development. When I was 13, my mom would ask me to help with her kids. At first it was just occasional, but then everyday. She needed me to pick up kids from school/stay home with other kids so she could go get more kids. When I said no, it became an argument of that \u2018I didn\u2019t care for the family\u2019 or \u2018I was selfish and never helped out\u2019. I can\u2019t count the times parents would leave their kids past 5pm and I\u2019d be the one who had to watch them because my parents had to take my siblings to their own stuff. There would be times that children would walk in on me naked getting dressed. I also wouldn\u2019t be allowed in my bedroom until 4pm everyday because she puts the kids in my bed for naps. The worst is that because she wants the money, she\u2019ll take kids who are sick (vomiting, bronchitis, etc.) and keep them in our house and in everyone\u2019s beds. When I was 16/17 I said I wanted my own space and I didn\u2019t want kids in my bedroom because it\u2019s my space/privacy. She refused and said this is her business and if I don\u2019t like it I can leave. We would have fights because she would want us to bring our friends over and we never wanted too. I never wanted to bring friends/bfs around screaming children all the time. I also said since this is her job, I wasn\u2019t going to be helping as she uses me constantly and if she wants to utilize me so frequently she has to pay me. She refused and said I was being ungrateful. My brother left when he was 16 as he didn\u2019t agree with her business/wanted his own space. My parents separated around 6 years ago, the home daycare wasn\u2019t the full reason why but My dad worked from home and he couldn\u2019t keep having the kids running around/screaming all day.\n\nI was laid off from my first engineering job which I had for about 1.5yrs. We agreed that a bed/bath can be built in the basement. But I will have to pay for the entire bed/bath because she doesn\u2019t want it.This will cost about $2200. Then pay $300/mo for rent (both of which I\u2019m more than happy to pay) and she claims that it\u2019s too little and since I made more than her when I worked I have to contribute more to the \u2018family\u2019. I told her she\u2019s only getting $300 (what she asked for) because I don\u2019t have a job right now and I\u2019m also not going to be contributing to water/hydro/food that she uses for people\u2019s children that she claims on her taxes under her business. She\u2019s kept her rates/child the same for 15 years. with inflation, she can hardly afford anything and barely can save any money. She also works another cleaning job at night. Ive tried teach her and properly educate her on supply/demand,etc. But she doesn\u2019t listen.\n\nEDIT: I moved out when I was 18 and in University until I was 24, then moved into an apartment with a roommate. My rent was $2500/month. When I lost my job. I had to move back home as my salary hardly covered my rent, food and expenses combined. I\u2019ve been interviewing for new jobs I\u2019m about 1 month out of work. I ended up getting severe bronchitis from a child who came with it (my mom let them in) and am now bedridden from what the doctor has said. I am very grateful I get to save money and pay something, but my sanity and we\u2019ll being would fly out the window. She is considered low income, she makes around $27,000/year she charges $50 per child per day. She pays for all meals, fresh fruits AND for them to eat GF. She pays for activities: art classes, gymnastics, etc. She works two jobs, has her bfs rent and my rent. She\u2019s been doing this for 25 years. And her rates haven\u2019t gone up in the past 10. The area of which I\u2019m in is very expensive, no minimum wage job or even a waitress job would cover rent. It\u2019s about $3500+ to live in an apartment and about 2500 to live with a roommate. Somebody called child services or something because my mom had 8 kids in the home when she\u2019s only supposed to have 5. Her business is being suspended. My brother is fighting forest fires and my dad and his gf won\u2019t allow me to move in with them.", "created_utc": 1697034966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175fhy1/aita_for_wanting_my_mom_to_quit_her_home_daycare/", "score": 568, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Living on my own was blissful \ud83d\ude0a", "Don't be so glib. OP said it's a high cost of living area and it sounds like there aren't a lot of jobs. It takes time, money (and a job) to be able to move. If in the US, most places require 1st & last month's rent and some require an additional deposit. If OP has to do free labor to live there, it makes it even more difficult to break free (and I suspect the mom knows this). I agree that OP's ultimate goal should be to move out, not making Mom's place more comfortable. It's just glib to toss out a costly solution as tho it's easy.", "People who say this are so out of touch. In this economy?? I don't blame op at all. NTA", "You know how hard things are rn?", "I\u2019ve already made a complete PP for her. I agree with you and have pitched this idea", "Did you not read the part where OP lost their job and had no other choice but to move back?\n\nDo you expect them to magically have enough money to afford living on their own with no job?", "If you read the post, they lost their job so had to move back. They are looking for work.\n\nThey can\u2019t magically just conjure up the money to live alone or with a roomie", "She pays for all the food, feeds them gluten free stuff, she pays for activities: art classes, gymnastics, toys, etc. Plus you have to factor in all the additional utilities being added every month. She doesn\u2019t make the parents pay for vacations or sick days. And they only pay her 5 days and if they don\u2019t come because they\u2019re sick they don\u2019t pay either.", "^this is what she says to me. She pays for all meals, feeds them gluten free stuff. She also pays for activities: art classes, gymnastics etc. Plus all the utilities for the home that are added every month. She claims that\u2019s what she makes to me. So idrk. Kinda wild. I should also add they don\u2019t pay for her vacation or sick days. If they don\u2019t come she doesn\u2019t get paid", "I pay rent to live there without a job. Her bf pays 10x what I pay.

Thank you though", "In my edit I explain what she pays for", "Thank you \u263a\ufe0f", "If you were working regular hours and you were of legal age to work (it's 14 in the US for relatives in family businesses), you might have legal recourse depending on your country/state.", "I truly don't understand people who say tell other to just leave/quit job/find another one. It really isn't that simple. What world do you live in?", ">I\u2019m working on it and working on relocating to a cheaper area as well\n\nFirst off, NTA. Second, if you have difficulties getting a position in your current line of work, a job that could work in the short term for you (after you are healthy again) is trucking (especially if you are US/Canadian based, not sure about other countries). \n\nUsually, there are companies that will pay for your training in exchange for agreeing to work with them for a specific term.\n\nThe benefit to this is that you can get a job working over the road in some capacity, and you won't have to worry about paying rent anywhere until you are ready,  then you can stack your savings until you find a low cost of living location you like that has a job in the field that you really like. \n\nJust a thought. Please ignore if it doesn't work for you.", "OP, God forbid on so many levels something happens to those kids and she\u2019s not licensed. \n\nI\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed for you on a speedy recovery and a new job.

Like there's a 3 week period before I get my first check at the new job, 3 weeks that I cannot afford to go without pay. I even tried the 2 jobs route but domino's won't let me work for both them and pizza hut lol", "This is awesome! I never thought of this. Thank you for commenting", "Also, the fucking argument \"oh just move out\" is so dumb. Are ppl not living in reality? Shit is expensive", "Mom likely has endangered a ton of kids by not having them in a controlled space of their home. My brother and I went to an in-home daycare in THE 70\u2019s and there were rules about where we could and couldn\u2019t go. I know people now who \u201ckeep kids\u201d for a living. It\u2019s unacceptable to let them go wherever unsupervised or to sleep in the family\u2019s beds. The kids are supposed to have nap mats for naps. Not to mention, her own children deserved to have their own space and freedom. \n\nAs for the family having \u201coutgrown\u201d the business, if it was started as a way for the family to avoid putting their children in daycare, once the kids didn\u2019t need daycare anymore they\u2019d outgrown it. If mom wanted to continue the business, she needed to run it herself and not let it interfere with her own children. \n\nWorking from home in an office setting is so different than running a daycare and letting kids run all over the house. As I said before, the kids in the daycare needed to be kept together. It\u2019s likely mom was breaking some regulations by not. \n\nAnd finally, by keeping her prices the same for 10 years, that says to me mom doesn\u2019t understand supply and demand or else is so questionable at her business she can\u2019t raise her rates.", "Think the issue is the *mom* doesn't realise this. She's operating in an expensive area, so likely has affluent or at least 'comfortable' clients, but hasn't upped her rates in a decade even though she needs a second job just to scrape by? She has people taking the piss coming late and just sucks it up and tries to impose on her family rather than giving them marching orders despite being shut down for having too many kids and so not exactly struggling to fill places? She let's sick kids come and infect her, her family, and other kids? This sounds like someone doing it as a favour to others who feels guilt for 'letting them down' by asking for fair compensation and respect of standard rules. If that's how she is treating her business, it's understandable why no one else views it as a 'real' job (the parents ripping it with latenesses, sending plague goblins, and expecting this to continue for next to nothing; OP seeing it as an inconvenient hobby).\n\nThe mom needs to quit dithering about whether this is a business or a 'side hussle'. If it's a business, then run it like one: charge in line with the market, stick to maximum capacities, deny sick (or at least seriously sick) kids, enforce penalties for lates and no-shows with clients getting fired for repeat abuse of this. If it's just a side hussle, then realise it's demanding too much and not worth it, and quit or reduce until it makes sense.", "Actually she can easily shut it down. All she has to do is provide notice to her clients saying X will be the last day. And then she stops accepting children and money from the job. That\u2019s it! The she can file her last tax return when the taxes are due.", "\"please stop running an illegal daycare that hurts you, children, your life, relationships, and home, while bleeding you dry in a way you've been complaining about for years.\"\n\nPlus OP paid for renovation and pays monthly rent, they're pretty much a tenant. The Economy sucks, mom is bad at her job, and if listening to reason is \"dictating\" by the gods I see how we got here.", "Exactly. This is a poorly run situation all together.", "Home daycares can be incredibly lucrative.   For my kids I paid around $800/month  and she had about 8-10 kids at a time depending on their ages.  That was a good dealt - others charge up to $1200/month.   (Talking in Canadian dollars).   Your mom needs to up her prices.", "You would be correct. House prices where I live are $1.5M-$2M. As I\u2019ve told her, she needs to move with the market. She\u2019s getting older and I worry for her health.", "Why is your mom paying for their activities?  If this is real and I'm doubting it, she is causing her own problems.  Tell the parents to send the children's meals or at least snacks and if they do activities the parents should be paying for that too.", "They can be. But with the way food prices are these days and how much stuff costs to take these kids places, it\u2019s crazy.", "I kid you not this is real. I grew up in this household. I agree with you", "She needs to up her prices.  And where is she taking them? My childcare never takes them anywhere except for a walk or to the park. When my kids were in daycare I\u2019d they had a field trip we were expected to pay for it.", "Believe me I know Ive told her. I\u2019ve explained to her so many times that she can do that. She even has a wait list - hence me teaching her supply/demand. She takes them to gymnastics, art classes, sometimes centres. She pays for it. Kinda wild to me", "That\u2019s crazy.", "Sorry, but your mom sounds really unstable. \n\nWhile you are an adult, I hesitate to call you TA.", "OP as you are having to depend on your mother for a roof over your head, she's not likely to see you as a source for advice.\n\nHer house, her lifestyle, her choice.", "Your implication was that OPs mother was ditching them when she was just asking for rent. Of course parents shouldn\u2019t ditch their kids but how does that relate to this post?", "I was just answering the comment saying that the mother didn\u2019t owe OP housing"]}
