I\u2019m 25. Originally, it was to make more income while she was staying at home with us. We constantly butt heads and I\u2019ve tried to tell her she can make more money doing ANYTHING else. Our family has long outgrown the business, and it has taken a toll on everyone, even my mom. \n\nWhen I was younger, it was good for my sibling\u2019s and I\u2019s social development. When I was 13, my mom would ask me to help with her kids. At first it was just occasional, but then everyday. She needed me to pick up kids from school/stay home with other kids so she could go get more kids. When I said no, it became an argument of that \u2018I didn\u2019t care for the family\u2019 or \u2018I was selfish and never helped out\u2019. I can\u2019t count the times parents would leave their kids past 5pm and I\u2019d be the one who had to watch them because my parents had to take my siblings to their own stuff. There would be times that children would walk in on me naked getting dressed. I also wouldn\u2019t be allowed in my bedroom until 4pm everyday because she puts the kids in my bed for naps. The worst is that because she wants the money, she\u2019ll take kids who are sick (vomiting, bronchitis, etc.) and keep them in our house and in everyone\u2019s beds. When I was 16/17 I said I wanted my own space and I didn\u2019t want kids in my bedroom because it\u2019s my space/privacy. She refused and said this is her business and if I don\u2019t like it I can leave. We would have fights because she would want us to bring our friends over and we never wanted too. I never wanted to bring friends/bfs around screaming children all the time. I also said since this is her job, I wasn\u2019t going to be helping as she uses me constantly and if she wants to utilize me so frequently she has to pay me. She refused and said I was being ungrateful. My brother left when he was 16 as he didn\u2019t agree with her business/wanted his own space. My parents separated around 6 years ago, the home daycare wasn\u2019t the full reason why but My dad worked from home and he couldn\u2019t keep having the kids running around/screaming all day.\n\nI was laid off from my first engineering job which I had for about 1.5yrs. We agreed that a bed/bath can be built in the basement. But I will have to pay for the entire bed/bath because she doesn\u2019t want it.This will cost about $2200. Then pay $300/mo for rent (both of which I\u2019m more than happy to pay) and she claims that it\u2019s too little and since I made more than her when I worked I have to contribute more to the \u2018family\u2019. I told her she\u2019s only getting $300 (what she asked for) because I don\u2019t have a job right now and I\u2019m also not going to be contributing to water/hydro/food that she uses for people\u2019s children that she claims on her taxes under her business. She\u2019s kept her rates/child the same for 15 years. with inflation, she can hardly afford anything and barely can save any money. She also works another cleaning job at night. Ive tried teach her and properly educate her on supply/demand,etc. But she doesn\u2019t listen.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve been interviewing for new jobs I\u2019m about 1 month out of work. I ended up getting severe bronchitis from a child who came with it (my mom let them in) and am now bedridden from what the doctor has said. I am very grateful I get to save money and pay something, but my sanity and we\u2019ll being would fly out the window. She is considered low income, she makes around $27,000/year she charges $50 per child per day. She relies on her other jobs, her bfs rent and my rent to even put food on our table. She\u2019s been doing this for 25 years. And her rates haven\u2019t gone up in the past 10. The area of which I\u2019m in is very expensive, no minimum wage job or even a waitress job would cover rent. It\u2019s about $3500+ to live in an apartment and about 2500 to live with a roommate. Somebody called child services or something because my mom had 8 kids in the home when she\u2019s only supposed to have 5. Her business is being suspended. My brother is fighting forest fires and my dad and his gf won\u2019t allow me to move in with them.", "created_utc": 1697034966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175fhy1/aita_for_wanting_my_mom_to_quit_her_home_daycare/", "score": 408, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good luck finding a job and getting the F out of there ASAP.  I would have gone the same route as your brother if forced into this environment. \n\nLet mom know that her insistence on keeping her poverty plague business going means you will NOT be taking care of her when she is too old to work but has no savings. \n\nNTA\n\nGlad someone called her in. I had a neighbor that was licensed for 8 and had 20 kids in her yard all day long until some other kind soul reported her neglect.", "NTA. Clearly, your mother has no concept of anyone beyond herself. She parentified you and your brother ASAP so you could work for her business at the cost of your personal and home lives, then told you to leave if you didn't want kids puking in your room.\n\nWhat's worse is she's struggling financially because she won't raise rates. If your job isn't paying enough, you look for a better job. When you own a business and it's not making enough, you raise prices and/or cut costs. She can't really cut costs since she wasn't willing to pay anyone regardless, and if she doesn't raise prices, losing her home will solely be on her. Basic business.\n\nAll that aside, you know your mother has no concept of other people being, well, people. The instant you're in the house she'll expect you to watch the cum trophies for no pay, and if you mention not wanting to, or how doing her job for 18 hours a day prevents you from doing anything else, she'll go right back to \"if you don't like it, leave.\" Just don't go to her house.", "NTA", "100% NTA, idk what everyone else is smoking but her \"business\" is a complete unmanageable mess, with many boundaries and regulations crossed.

Work out how much time your room was unavailable to you growing up, stop paying rent, and tell your mom that when the rent you haven't paid equals the rent she ought to have been paying you for use of your room, you'll start paying again.

NTA\u2014OP, your mom sounds insane.", "How does she only make 27k. The math doesn't work on this one. Is she only taking two kids???", "I might be in the minority but NTA. Your mom has let her business come between her and her family and expected you to be an unpaid employee for her. \n\nI completely sympathize with you about the struggle of finding a job during inflation and being able to afford your own place, but I would definitely consider to start looking outside your city for jobs. Engineering is probably competitive, but it's always needed anywhere, so you should get lucky. I hope everything works out for you.", "NTA your mom is abusive and awful, and you should report her \"business\" to whatever protective service there is for kids in daycare. And who can move out in today's economy? Yes, try to leave, obviously, but don't beat yourself up for not being able to instantly have the at least 5k it costs to move. People are being unnecessarily harsh on you for falling on hard times. I moved out at 20, and in the last 2 years I've had 5 jobs, did sex work, chosen between gas, groceries, and bills, and paid $1500 in mechanic bills (and growing). Shit sucks and I wouldn't wish this kind of life on anyone, but it's just what happens sometimes. I don't have the option to go home, as I'm estranged, so I recommend you do what I didn't and make sure you're fully prepared for a move", "NTA, for sure. Anyone claiming you are the AH is really out of touch on a concerning level. I'm shocked reading these comments and I hope they don't get to you.

Your mother failed you and your siblings for not enforcing solid boundaries and protecting your privacy. She also had no right to parentify you or require you to provide free labor in her business. But you are an adult now and can find a new place to live. I would not put any money into making a new bedroom or anything. Save your money, find a roommate and set up your own house hold. It sounds like that would be less stress on everyone.", "You need to leave. You're an adult now. Find a new job and pay rent for a space that is just for you.

Presumably the kids parents are bringing diapers and wipes...count food costs and increases in utilities and maybe liscencing and insurance..but even then I think the average cost for at home daycare here is like $850 a month. If other people are making it..how is your mom not? \n\nSome at home daycares here in Texas also qualify for food subsidies and other benefits.. It's also pretty standard that your pay for your spot, so you pay regardless of attendance. \n\nI'm questioning how your mom is broke.", "ESH\n\nSounds like maybe your mom's decisions with the biz have not always been the best.\n\nBut you live there for cheap, so that's the trade off.

Your mom has clearly prioritized the business over her family and yeah, that sucks. But you\u2019re 25, you\u2019re under no obligation to continue to live there.

Also, Mum used the lounge room for sleeping and used it to teach kids to clean up before nap time- parents loved this as those kids ended up doing that at home. \n\nAs for OP: Your mum treats you as 'free labour'. That's a boundary for you to slap up. I don't think there's an easy solution for you other that 'get a job and move out', but your short term option is really just 'set boundaries'. If it's kid related- say no.

It actually costs thousands of dollars, and lots of time to save that. Also, the job market is god awful and has been for the last 3 years so it's not so easy to just get a better job either.

I'm 28, working a well-paid full time job and studying a second degree while still living with my parents. Why? Because I don't live in the US of A and living alone in my country and in the city I live in is nearly impossible unless you move out with friends or roommates, and even then finding a place to rent is an herculean task. Wish it were as easy as the first guy says, I imagine with the train wreck the job and house market are right now it must be difficult in the USA as well... And it's not like OP isn't looking for a new job either. \n\nNTA OP, hope you manage to find something soon.

Sounds illegal and dangerous.", "I would be so concerned if I paid a woman to watch my kids and found out she was sending her 13 year old to get them from school or having the daughter watch them while the person I\u2019m paying was gone with her other kids. That\u2019s horrible.", "Plus since OP's mom takes kids when they are sick.

Especially with the edit that its being suspended for having too many kids.", "your praising this mother way too much for whatever she's done to countless kids in their area, not to mention her own.", "Let's be real here though, a business is really not that hard to shut down in these circumstances. It would take more than a 2 week notice, but again, not super hard. There's no shareholders, no employees or other directors - she's the sole owner and sole employee. She's operating out of her home and although she is claiming certain deductions on her taxes, it doesn't seem like any of the home or utility contracts are under the business name. Really, as long as the business isn't completely insolvent (or has been made insolvent) all her tax obligations are up to date and she potentially gives the parents notice, it's pretty straightforward.\n\nNot to mention there's no way this is an actual, legitimate business to begin with. That requires proper accreditation, licensing and is supposed to also entail regular checks. Last time I checked, you were supposed to have a space specifically dedicated for children to sleep in, not just putting them to sleep in your existing bedrooms. Mixing age groups is also kinda iffy, especially when it comes to the legal ratios. Knowingly taking seriously sick kids is a massive liability issue, so mum either has incredibly good and expensive insurance or none at all. And getting a minor who is not an employee, with no actual training or certification to solely look after the children at times is not only illegal but a liability risk too.", "Hello! I can understand your POV. I understand this is a job. She definitely does not make more than an average employee running this daycare. In fact I think it\u2019s actually running her dry since she hasn\u2019t been moving accordingly with inflation. Since I\u2019ve been born she\u2019s been working two jobs. She complains constantly. I\u2019ve tried to tell her that if she were to do something else she would be paid more with other benefits added on, as my father told her before they separated. Not to mention, some of her parents nowadays are are a complete joke and I can\u2019t believe they would walk all over somebody who watches their own children for a living.

It\u2019s my own opinion, you have a right to think differently, I just think that this mindset where you can\u2019t rely on your parents at all even when older is shitty", "I never talked about rent. At the end of the day, it would be their house and their choice, I\u2019m just saying that we should be able to rely on our parents no matter the age, they literally birthed/raised you, why would they act like you\u2019re not their child anymore just because you\u2019re grown?", "OPs post is essentially about rent though", "Yeah? I just said I didn\u2019t talk about rent in my own comments. If the parent wants you to pay rent, just do it. All I\u2019m saying is that parents shouldn\u2019t abandon their children."]}
