I lost my job to covid and was hustling self-employed style as a copywriter. I threw myself into my work because I had to survive while I grieved. \n\nBut.. I became so Ill and so depressed with mystery sicknesses that appeared out of no where. Throwing up randomly, having dizzy spells, awful crippling depression crept up on me because I forced myself to keep going. And I actually couldn\u2019t work anymore, my body and mind wouldn\u2019t let me so i lost money and had to live off of credit cards until I could get a real job\n\nThis is what you\u2019re putting on your daughter. In the real world, people get doctor notes for depression and stress and then don\u2019t go into work for months. Taking a personal day is nothing", "YTA. In the \"real world,\" people understand loss, and they understand that sometimes you need a day off because you wouldn't be productive anyway when you're in that state of mind. Instead of teaching your kid things like \"everyone experiences grief,\" \"you're not special,\" \"this is just how life works,\" let off a bit and give her a break. Especially if she has to play catch up because she was sick for so long. Wouldn't you want the same if it was you?", "YTA.

If you don't make space for your feelings, they leak out elsewhere. Give her a fucking day off. In \"adult life\" you can absolutely take off for a pet dying. \n\nI took off 2 weeks last month because my mom died. Am I less of an adult because of that? \n\nSome of yall are so emotionally stunted it makes me sick", "YTA.\n\nI am an adult, who has had a paying job in the real world for a long time now. During that time I've lost quite a few pets, and each time my manager/supervisor has allowed or encouraged me to take time off the day after to deal with what happened, and now that I'm a manager I do the same for my staff.\n\nIf she's upset and crying she's not going to be able to turn off her feelings and learn and have a productive day. I'd say it's much better to take the time to work through those feelings and go back on Tuesday with a clearer head and more settled heart.", "YTA. Several of my coworkers have taken a day off when a pet passed away \"in the real world\". Should she take the whole week off, no. Did she have an important responsibility or task due on Monday? Then maybe there's a \"we can't always get out of things\" lesson, but it's summer school and it's one day. Write the kid an excuse for missing the day. Your kid will have days off in the real world to use at their discretion without a \"serious illness\"...", "YTA.\n\nI mean\u2026no\u2026in the \u201creal world\u201d people are allowed to take time off for grief, mental health days, etc. You\u2019re \u201cwork unless you\u2019re on your death bed\u201d mentally is giving off boomer energy.", "NAH, you would\u2019ve been right either way here.

However, if she is unable to function, sending her was probably pointless.", "I never cried more then when I lost my childhood pet and TO THIS DAY. Wtf is going on here? Honestly I\u2019m so shocked by all these NTA remarks. I feel like people are missing the lesson to be learned here. Instead of taking the time to process grief in a healthy way, you are saying \u201cnobody in the real world\u201d (including us) cares about your feelings. Bury it. Teach her grace, empathy, compassion. The real world will teach her these \u201clessons\u201d if it so chooses, there is absolutely no need to get ahead of as parents. That\u2019s like saying, my kids will face bullies, that\u2019s the real world, I just want to be prepared so I will bully them. It\u2019s loses logical meaning. Parents are meant to prepare their kids so they respond well in difficult situations not manufactured hardship so that they can \u201clearn.\u201d Honestly it seems so damaging I\u2019m really having trouble understanding why anyone would ever think it\u2019s a good idea. \n\nDo I think that letting her stay home should have been used as a time to process and morn? Sure! She didn\u2019t need to just stay home and watch tv. Let her have a little ceremony for the cat and say goodbye, let her cry. Tell funny stories about the cat. Look at photos and videos together. Then say ok, now tomorrow, we think we are ready to go back to school. I\u2019m sorry that this is how the world works but when you get home we will be here to support you emotionally.\u201d Why are parents so quick to be the first people to cut their kids down just because they want to be \u201crealistic.\u201d\n\nAdditionally this poor kid had long covid meaning their reason for being in summer school had nothing to do with their own decisions. AND while home alone while sick, nearly losing her mind away from her friends and life, I would guess that cat was a huge support. \n\nAlso, to be fair, at least in the US I think this is a fairly old fashioned view. And becoming more old fashioned rapidly. I never tell my employer any additional detail while  calling in sick especially if it\u2019s a mental health issue. It\u2019s none of their business and it won\u2019t be any of your future daughters employers. That\u2019s the lesson you should be teaching her. \n\nSo I guess it\u2019s just about what kinda relationship do you want with your daughter. One where feels like she can come to you with hardship, or one where she doesn\u2019t tell you because you will tell her it\u2019s the \u201creal world\u201d and she really doesn\u2019t need any more of that in her life.", "YTA.  She wanted one day.  I've taken a day off after a pet death and I know other adults who gave.  This isn't teaching her \"responsibility.\" It's teaching her that get her feelings mean nothing", "NTA.

NTA", "NAH It's tough, but sometimes it's really hard to miss school or work. I've come to work after having to have my dog euthanized.

It would be really nice if your daughter could take time off, but unfortunately she is already behind in school and really needs to attend. She can\u2019t risk falling further behind and you are doing the right thing by making sure she keeps going.", "NAH.  You were trying to be good parents.  There was no malice in the decision.\n\nEdit:  Parents make mistakes just like anyone else. Unless there is malice who among us is ordained to cast the first stone.  Are there any parents out there who haven't made mistakes?   Disagree.  Don't judge.  Abusers should get universal condemnation.", "NTA: Education does not care about that. Later jobs do not care about that. Most jobs even jsut give you payed time off if one of your DIRECT relatives dies.\n\nIt was a cat. I get it. I loved my cat too. But as you said. She is almost and adult not a small child. People need to be able to go on with their daily live despite something like this.", "NTA As a former educator, thank you for teaching your daughter this! Some will say that YTA, but it simply is not true. Life has its suffering, but that does not mean we have to stop and dwell in it. One can grieve a lost loved one (of four feet or two) while still keeping busy.\n\nEdit:  I am not saying one should avoid their feelings at all. I am speaking of continuing with healthy behaviors and not wallowing in sorrow for a long time.", "You are absolutely **NTA**, as you did the right thing.\n\nIn grief someone may not want to do anything, yet life goes on.\n\nOn a farm, for example, one must still feed the animals and tend the crops. When one needs to make progress or succeed in some other way, the ability to be resilient and step outside oneself and still fulfil obligations to others can make a tremendous difference.\n\nNote that it is possible to grieve, even deeply, and function at least minimally. It's even possible to feel grief and yet also feel other emotions which are not grief and not even sad, in cycles, and that all are manageable when noticed, understood, allowed.\n\nAdditionally, a difference between **school** and an **employer** is that the educational institution is usually tasked with provision of support and counseling services to at least a somewhat greater extent. When the child's ***entire*** home support network is ***already also grieving***, the chance to experience some additional outside discussions would be beneficial.

I'm 30 yo so I live in this supposed real world.... and I will tell you right now that if my cat or my dog died? I would be out of work for AT LEAST a few days. You're trying to prepare her for a crappy world tbh, you should be preparing her for a world in which she matters, as well as her physical and mental health. \"Barring serious illness\"? That is not how the real world works. If she is sick she will stay home from work because 1 she has a right to not force herself to be uncomfortable for a company that doesn't give a crap about her and 2 her co-workers have a right to not be exposed to illnesses that will inconvenience them too (or worse). Your attitude makes me think that you would scoff at someone who took a \"mental health day\" from work if they were suffering from depression or had something going on mentally. You're preparing her for a harsh reality that honestly simply doesn't exist anymore. Especially her generation, they are not putting up with the BS that these companies are trying to force upon workers. She deserves a living wage and to take off work when she needs to. If YOUR reality is a life that revolves 100% around your job? Where your daily decider is a faceless company?

Why am I unsurprised by this garbage take lmao", "Who hurt you?\n\nWho taught you denying your emotions was the right thing to do?", "The responses acting like she's learning quantum physics during summer school are baffling me. She 1000% could miss a day and be fine. The parents could've even called or had her call the school/email the teacher and explain the situation and ask about homework/missed coursework for the day. That's how you really handle the \"real world\" that OP mentions. Take care of yourself and be accountable. There's no situation where missing one day of summer school would ruin this kid from advancing to the next grade.

It's your sad truth that you can't take a pause when you aren't happy or sick. \n\nShould she take the week off, no. But one day because she's torn up about the loss of a pet is such a no-brainer yes.

That's how the world ACTUALLY works.\n\nYou \"the world is harsh\" people are always just trying to punish and victimize children even when the world isn't actually that way.

The kid has clearly been through a lot battling long covid and having to do summer school. Taking one day to grieve isn't the end of the world and the teach her \"about the real world\" that OP mentions is misguided at best and heartless at worst. People get sick time and personal days.

No. That's how the world works.", "And, of course you are the arbiter of right and wrong.  Are you a parent who never made a mistake?", "So you disagree with their decision.

Taking one mental heath day is not dwelling. What an overreaction", "Did... did you even read the post? Okay first of all she's in summer school because she had LONG COVID. Ew your immediate condemnation of this child because she is in summer school is so gross. Even if she WAS struggling academically that doesn't make this death any less hard for her to process. You NEVER punish a child (especially for things like academic failure) by TRAUMATIZING THEM... I am so grossed out by your comment. So if a kid does bad academically then they don't deserve to be mentally healthy and safe? They don't get to process their grief? That is wrong on so many levels. Even if she was there for academic reasons your take is still vile. What kind of person condemns a kid to a life of failure or.. \"having a boot on their neck\" because they did poor academically one year? And usually children do poor academically because of something bad going on in their home life. How do you just give up on kids that quickly? I am honestly really hoping that you do not have children... that's so sad to think that you would give up on them SO QUICKLY and condemn them as failures for the smallest flaws. You condemned this girl without even reading the reason why she was in summer school. You're being judgemental and harsh, kids make mistakes....", "Interesting to know thanks for info. :)", "That's not correct.  While they can't ask for specifics about your illness they can ask a general \"why\" you're calling in and can require a doctor's note if it's health related (unless there are specific rules you agreed to in terms of employment).
