For example, my paternal uncles are called something different depending on whether they're older or younger than my dad, same with aunts... And uncles and aunts on my mom's side are again called differently, and it also depends on whether they're older or younger than her. So in Chinese, when someone calls an elder something, you can actually easily deduce how they're related (eg. My mother's older brother, my grandma's younger sister, or sometimes, even more specifically, like, my mom's oldest sister or my dad's second oldest brother).", "That makes no sense.
