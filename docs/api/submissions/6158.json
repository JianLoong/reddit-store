The parents are upset that I am not respecting their wishes.  I'm upset because I feel like their wishes dont actually take respecting me into account. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: This conversation has already been had with my friend, which is why I'm posting here for perspective.  She solidly feels her children (age 8-11) should be referring to people this way because its respectful.  She doesnt care that im not really comfortable with it and would prefer something else. She thinks I'm the asshole because I think its disrespectful to call someone something they dont like. I've suggested the compromise of Miss Firstname which is somewhat common by me. Miss is used regardless of marital standard.  She dislikes that.  I was also raised calling someone that until you are told different.  Because of that, when im called Mrs. Lastname, I thank them for being polite or respectful and tell them to please call me by First/Nickname.\n\nEDIT #2: This is stated in the first edit.  I have suggested to my friend a compromise of Miss Firstname.  She will not budge.  She is firmly holding her ground that her kids need to show me respect by calling me Mrs. Lastname and anything less than that is her children being disrespectful.", "created_utc": 1672543689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100au6c/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_called_mrs_lastname/", "score": 1814, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And uncles and aunts on my mom's side are again called differently, and it also depends on whether they're older or younger than her.

I\u2019ve worked with kids my entire adult life. I\u2019ve been \u201cMiss Firstname\u201d at every single job I\u2019ve had when working with kids. When I got married I was working at a childcare. I left for my wedding/honeymoon as Miss and came back as Miss.", "I\u2019ve noticed even Miss LastName being used (or could be more of a Ms. pronunciation). \n\nI\u2019m sitting here trying to think of the last time I was called Mrs. LastName (as I am married) but I can\u2019t remember. Even at doctor appointments and parent teacher conferences I\u2019m Miss LastName. \n\nMrs. LastName is my mother in law, dammit!", "Not just teachers. Anyone who works with kids are often \u201cMiss firstname\u201d regardless if marital status. I currently work at a residential facility for children. I have always been referred to as \u201cMiss firstname\u201d by the kids and teenagers at work. When I got married I was working at a childcare. I left on leave for my wedding/honeymoon as Miss and I came back as Miss.", "Tbh, in the South, Mrs Miss and Ms all sound like Mizz. Lol", "Interesting, thank you!  Yeah I\u2019m sitting here like I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a big deal how they spell the same word, but if they sound different and actually have different connotation (where I live they don\u2019t) then I can see it being an issue.  The biggest difference I would say we have is you generally write Miss for first names and Ms. for last.  Miss is less formal", "Yeah that\u2019s kinda the way I feel here in the Midwest. They all sound the same.", "I\u2019m from California, and we called our elementary school teachers by their first names in one school. California is aggressively casual. In middle and high school we called them Mr/Ms Lastname, though.", "I am actually an egg roll.", "That's Walnuts to you, Lucy. \ud83d\ude01", "I called my boss \"mom\" once. The thing is, she and I were good friends AND only separated by about 3 years... the look she gave me was priceless, but afterwards, she called me her daughter, or her problem child, and i just kept calling her mom, much to the utter confusion of EVERYONE we worked with, including the district manager."]}
