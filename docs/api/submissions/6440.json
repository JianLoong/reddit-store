One of the guests was my brother and SIL's friend.\n\nAt some point during the night, we started talking about work history and hobbies. The girl, who I'll call Tech-Girl, talked about how she was a fitness instructor on the side and had previous retail work, but jumped from desk job to desk job too, that was until she got laid off during the pandemic (she also mentioned that she struggled with jobs laying her off in the past before promoting her, hence why she struggled to move up). But she said that thankfully, right before Christmas, she got a new job, a job in tech sales.\n\nNow, I have this problem where my face *naturally* tells people what I'm thinking; and I guess, I made a face and she noticed. She looked at me and asked if something was wrong and I laughed because I had a hard time believing it and I thought she was joking. She smiled and laughed and said that she wasn't.\n\nI told her that it seems hard to believe considering her background - she doesn't have strong sales experience other than retail and customer service. But, not related to tech. She also has both a BS and MBA degrees, but not related to tech either, just business. Also, she was a fitness instructor in aerial fitness. Therefore, someone like her being in tech is hard to believe. Someone with her kind of interests just doesn't seem like they'd be interested in tech.\n\nI then asked if recruiters sought her out, since it wouldn't be hard to believe considering she is attractive and it makes sense for companies wanting attractive salespeople. She said no, and that she did research on tech companies and did cold calling and emails to CEOs, recruiters, and VPs.\n\nI was still taken aback because getting into tech seems hard, especially for someone like her. \n\nI apologized for laughing and I congratulated her on the new job. The rest of the night seemed pretty well, except it seemed like a few people, including my parents and brother, seemed annoyed at me.\n\nAfter we all went home, my brother texted me saying that I was very rude to Tech-Girl. My brother even went up to her privately and apologized for me, but she told him that it was OK and to not worry about it. My brother, SIL, and parents apparently don't agree, and said that I not only embarrassed them, but myself as well.\n\nIt just seems to hard to believe that Tech-Girl basically beat the odds and got a job in tech. How can it not seem funny?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672818344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102xj5v/aita_for_laughing_at_a_girl_for_saying_she_worked/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
