I was lucky that my junior and senior year my boyfriend was very generous and wanted to help me with my bills so I could focus on school. I got a 4.0 GPA every single quarter after I quit my job. This new time also allowed me time to intern, which is essential now to getting a good job after you graduate. I was never a bad student, but when you have to spend all of your time worrying about making ends meet, it\u2019s really hard to have the stamina and concentration necessary to do well in these highly competitive and challenging programs.

You don\u2019t have to give her a bunch of spending money but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for a family to keep paying for kids necessary bills like insurance as long as they can afford it.

I\u2019m going to use myself as scenario one/example here: studying for the LSAT, maximum course load (18 units), and volunteering at two different public service orgs, plus a bunch of random health stuff/appointments- at least one a week. I would simply perish if I had work part time on top of that - I\u2019m literally stretched as thin as possible. But that\u2019s very different than someone with a light course load who\u2019s doing the minimum to get a degree.

Was it totaled because she hit a deer late at night driving home/someone hit her? Or was it totaled because she was drunk for example? If it was clearly her fault I don\u2019t have sympathy- but if it was legitimately an accident, I\u2019d find it harder to punish her for it. \n\nBasically not enough info imo", "If she doesn't want to work, she doesn't have to.

That really helped, then over my first summer I worked back in my home town and got a job in a pub for when I was back at uni. That paid for my spending money, my petrol and my car insurance (mobile phones were a brand new thing when I was in uni so I just had to buy minutes on it :) \n\nHaving a job early made it so much easier to join the workforce after college - I worked in HR for a long time and it was appalling how many new grads had absolutely no clue how to function in an adult environment because they hadn\u2019t been working part time prior.

If I went to school full time I did not have to have a job. If I went to school part time I was expected to have a part time job and if I didn\u2019t go to school at all I was expected to have a full time job. I did however either work or do internships during my summers. My parent\u2019s supported me during internships and let me keep my money that I earned during the summer while working - didn\u2019t expect me to contribute to household bills.

Granted I\u2019m 31 now not 21. I hope to one day provide for my daughter what my parents were able to provide for me.

That's at MOST $600 a month, closer to $500-$550 after taxes. Is that really worth an entire extra work week a month if you can afford to just spot your kid the money instead, assuming that she really is treating college as a full-time job? I don't see how \"your time is worth a pittance and forget about your mental health\" is a good lesson personally.
