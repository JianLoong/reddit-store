By the time they really need one you should be off to college, or pretty close. At that point I think you'll have to kiss the room good bye.

NAH, once the baby moves out of your parent's room it makes more sense to have the two of you with similar schedules in one room, and the baby with radically different needs in another.  And it makes sense that you're resentful about it.  It is a shame your parents' family planning worked out this way.", "NAH, I get that it sucks, but its honestly not up to you, and while the baby is best of roomsharing to start, your parents are going to want their space back eventually, and its their right to rearrange the sleeping arrangements as they see fit (within reason). \n\nWhile there is obviously a limited number of rooms available, maybe there's some wiggle room to negotiate with.

That\u2019s a difficult age to have little privacy. \n\nA baby will wake up every couple of hours for the first year of its life; their stomachs are very small and they need frequent meals. Your parents WILL be getting up with the baby all through the night for quite a while. Some studies have also shown it can decrease the risk of SIDS when the baby rooms with the mother.\n\nIf you plan to go to college or move out at 18, your little sibling will have a readily available room at that time. You can make the case to your parents that they put it off until then. But if not, at the end of the day, they are the adults and it\u2019s their house.", "NAH. I'm so sorry that this situation sucks, probably for mom just as much as you. She knows that you two are closer in age and neither of you need to share with a baby.

But it can also be fun too.\n\nYour little sibling when they are an infant and then toddler is going to be loud, messy, have an irregular sleep schedule, chaotic, and just generally actually will need its own space to do those things in. They will disrupt whoever they share their space with a lot more than the people in the replies and you seem to realize. \n\nIn a perfect world, all parents would have a room for every kid but the idea of kids sharing rooms is not this new or extreme thing. \n\nJust a quick note -  since \"you ***have*** to have privacy as a teen\" is the big thing being tossed around, wait'll you learn that 18-20-year-olds are forced to share a room in college...", "For all the people saying that a baby doesn\u2019t need it\u2019s own room, you are totally correct, it doesn\u2019t.

I bet OP will be DELIGHTED when they have to share their room with a toddler ESPECIALLY when they\u2019re teething or toilet training.\n\nTrust me, it\u2019s FAR better for OP to move in with their teenage sister than a toddler.

(well, there's an argument your parents should take that on, but that would be an uphill battle and you're going to want them to get as much sleep as they can when they have a baby so they can be better parents for you, too.) sorry about this situation, op. really not ideal. but i think you'll have to give it up and share with your sister.", "NTA.", "NTA, but think this through.

When you chose to have children you take the rough and the smooth, and it\u2019s their responsibility to accommodate everyone and that obviously includes you and your sister. You\u2019re both at important schooling ages so quiet study space is more important for you two, as a baby is not going to notice whether they\u2019re in their own room, or their parents room as long as it\u2019s a relaxed enough space for them to get all their much needed sleep in - which, again, is down to your mum and dad.

And OP's parents are under no obligation to make *three* people share a room so that OP can have one to herself? Especially to keep doing it whether or not it works for everyone else until OP leaves for college. Why exactly is OP more important then three other family members? \n\nFor a different perspective, when I had my first they had their own room (moved in overnight at 5 months). When I had my second we had to room share until 1.5 beacuse it was a two bedroom place and we didn't want her waking her big sister. I found it incredibly inconvenient and everyone, including the wee one, got less sleep. It was much easier for the older kid with their own room to learn to sleep all night, and once we moved to a three bedroom place her sleep got so much better. Also, it meant both adults couldn't use our room or any space in it to do things we liked to do past 6:30pm every single day. We had to move both of our desks out into the living room, or we wouldn't have been able to do anything. And if one parent needs their computer in an isolated space to work sometimes, than that's really a problem. Also, I as a mother always woke up from small sounds and stuff the baby makes, so I did not go back to getting a really good nights sleep for 1.5 bleeping years until baby got their own room. \n\nI'm not saying it wasn't great for you.

That's what you'd say if it was OP owned the house and a pregnant couple wanted to move in and take her room. \n\nBut you do realize this is the pregnant couple's house right? So yes, it's their job to find a place for their baby to live. And they have. *In their house.* When OP says it's \"her\" room you realize it's actually her parents room and they are currently letting her stay there? So, it is her problem if they stop letting her stay in that room, since they own the house and get to decide. \n\n>Why can't they put the child's crib in their own room for a couple of years? I presume to ensure their own comfort, whilst bulldozing over yours?\n\nSo if you have a family of 5 and 3 bedrooms, you would put 3 people in one room so that the other two could get individual rooms? That makes sense to you?\n\nI have raised a baby both with their own room, and with the second child in our room until 1.5 years. Part of why we moved is for us, that wasn't working well. It negatively impacted the sleep of both the adults and the toddler, who started sleeping so much better once they got their own room. Also, it gave us more room for the toddler to have her own dresser, toys, and a toddler bed which didn't fit in mom and dad's room. It's like you don't think OP's sibling is also a person? And they don't matter too? Suggesting the toddler be stuck in the small corner of a three person room for \"a few years\" so princess OP can have her own room is odd to me. \n\nCouldn't we by your logic say \"it's not babies fault mom and dad choose to have a teenager. Not baby's problem. Get out OP\"?", "They also pay the rent.

Some people don\u2019t because it isn\u2019t how they want to live and so they come up with alternatives like share houses etc, which is not the same as sharing a room", "Exactly, in your socioeconomic environment that is normal and common for you. For 80%+ the rest of the world, this is not the norm. That\u2019s what out of touch with reality means, it means that your only understanding of the situation is based on your own standing.", "Do you know how long it can take to sell a house? And get another mortgage for the next house? \n\nIs her little sister also supposed to move schools and make new friends all so OP can have a room to herself?", "Idk where OP is from but in America universities have dorms that are commonly shared with at least 1 other person", "That\u2019s even worse. Why should the parents abort? So their 16 year old doesn\u2019t have to share a room. That\u2019s a vile idea", "The recommendation in Australia is that infants should sleep in the same room as their parents for at least the first six to twelve months as a SIDS prevention measure.", "> After about a year, babies need very quiet, dark spaces to sleep if you want them to sleep through the night.\n\nAnd why would the parents room not qualify as this? lol", "It really is. Families change, kids grown up and move out, new kids are born. Having the teens share is the most reasonable option here.", "Babies do not need their own rooms and it's not advised to have them sleep in their own room until they're at least a year old for SIDS prevention. \n\nAlso, they're not constantly waking up in the night past the newborn phase. The majority are sleeping through the night by 6 months and many are only waking up once or twice during the night after about 3 months.", "i'm 8 years older than my little half sister and what i remember is that parent units moved to the living room when she was 4 and i got the master bedroom and she got my old one", "To answer your question YES, the ones who decided to reproduce should be inconvenienced.", "Well no, but why should the daughter have added stress and lack of privacy due to their poor planning? She\u2019s not the one that laid down and got pregnant \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "The only thing this will do is cause both sisters to resent the parents and the baby.", "Wow. \n\nYou really think the best decision is to kick a teenager out of their own room for 2 more years over an infant that won\u2019t know they don\u2019t have their own space to sleep in? If people can survive shared rooms, surely the parents can survive sharing a room with the life they created?", "She has her room for 16 years, her sister for 13 and all of a sudden they reproduce again and want to shift the dynamic completely.", "Do you think the parents are throwing raves in their bedroom after putting the kids down?", "No, they don\u2019t. People train their kids to need dark quiet places to sleep.", "privacy.", "Point me to the law or rule anywhere that says two teenage sisters can't share a room", "Yeah I've never been comfortable with the whole baby in the room thing either. Hubby initiated 1 time when 1 of our babies was in the room & we shared a look & both went \"move the spawn\" \ud83e\udd23 hell, I wouldn't even have sex with his damn dog in the room....that little shit would watch. You'd be having fun, look at the end of the bed & see 2 eyes. Nope. Not happening. Vibe is dead.", "I\u2019m sorry your parents were lazy and didn\u2019t try to consider your feelings in their decisions. They are important and they do matter. I hope you break the cycle with your own kids, but it sounds like you can\u2019t recognize how wrong they were and that makes me sad.", "Nope. I\u2019m all for being reasonable with boundaries as a parent but kid, especially teens deserve privacy to a certain extent. Parents who decide to have more kids than they can comfortably handle should be the ones making sacrifices as a result for heir actions. Not teens. I slept naked as a teen. Imagine sharing a room with my also teen sibling. Not to mention, that\u2019s inconveniencing your kids as a result of YOU deciding to have sex. That\u2019s what freakin entitled.", "My sister and I were forced to share a room until I moved out for college. We are two years apart. Sharing a room through teenage years was HELL. We spent years not speaking to each other and only got to be friends again when we each had our own space. Forcing a 16 year old to give up their private space so a drooling infant who should be sleeping closer to the parents anyway can have one is cruel.", "I'm guessing you wonder regularly why your children don't call or visit as much as you'd like, or at all.", "I feel like you\u2019re the mom. Or dad.", "since we're sharing anecdotal evidence to prove things, when i was younger i had to share a room with my brother. we don't get along at all. plenty of kids can share a room and get along and plenty of kids can share a room and end up despising each other. based on op's post, it seems that second one is much more likely", "You do know that the sleep safety recommendations for infants is room sharing for a minimum of six months, right?       Babies are safest sleeping in their parents' room, not alone.    A baby does not need its own room.  Between a baby and a near adult, the adult is much more needing of privacy.", "Now that\u2019s crap haha. The parents should have known that there wasn\u2019t enough room for more children so they should\u2019ve stopped. Now they\u2019re making one child move in with another when clearly the baby belongs in the parents room.", "It\u2019s fitting that you\u2019re a proctologist because your opinions are ass", "So you\u2019re saying that OP should share a room with her sister at 16 instead of 17? How would that make things better for OP? That\u2019s my question.", "I don\u2019t see a point in making the two girls share a room sooner than need be. Most likely the baby room wouldn\u2019t be used that often. Why make them share a room when that room barely being used?", "Why not just keep the effin baby in the parents rooms until op goes to college or moves out? Why is it okay to completely uproot your older kids lives because you decided to have another child, especially this late in life? These kids are already unlikely to have a close relationship because of the age difference, why make it worse by causing resentment and alienation?", "Because the parents have to, you know, use their room? How are they going to get undressed, ready for bed, get clothes out for the morning, etc, if they have to keep the room dark and quiet because the baby\u2019s asleep? And babies sleep a *lot* when they\u2019re small. Sleeping and nursing is all they do at first.", "I assume the parents are going to bed later than the recommended time for a one year old, which is 6-8PM. Those are really important hours for parents of young kids where they catch up on things and they may use their room for any number of things, including marital activities which at some point gets really weird in front of a baby.", "Must be nice to have only ever had gold-plated babies.", "Did they \u201cdecide\u201d, 13 years after their last kid, to have another child?  Or did this situation come about without deliberate intent?\n\nI think that the people who work to keep a roof over everyone\u2019s heads, who need to be able to sleep so they can function to provide for *all* of the children, and who will be sleep deprived enough from caring for a new child, should get to decide how bedrooms are divided in their house.  But that\u2019s just my opinion.", "Who says it's poor planning? They're having a third child, in a 3 bedroom house. Like OMFG call the police! \ud83e\udd23", "That's a risk when you have another child later. There isn't much they can other than get a 4 bedroom house.\n\n\nSooner or later somebody is going to lose a room.\n\n\nLife is about adjusting.", "Do you know how many teenagers don\u2019t have their own room at all? This won\u2019t kill OP.", "I don't think it needs to happen right away but yeah when the baby is 6 months to a 1 year. Their bedroom could be small. For all we know. I think it's the best solution.  The 16 is going to lose their room either when they graduate or after the baby is born.", "Dude, I've had two kids and at around a year old, just about anything can distract them and keep them up. I'd absolutely make my kids share a room before I tried sharing a room with a one year old.", "Cool. I would still make the teens share a room.", "I don\u2019t have kids and I never said I did. I\u2019m talking about my childhood genius", "Haha I was just going to say this", "Omg grow up.", "OP will still be living at home when it\u2019s time to move the baby to their own room so why wait to do it? Just tear off the band aid", "How do we know this was a planned pregnancy?", "No? I am saying that even if moving your two teens together to give a room to your baby was a fucking reasonable use of bedroom space, it's still shouldn't even be coming up yet since the baby Should. Be. In The. Parent's. Room until OP is 17  at least.", "Because OP works just spend the next year complaining about eventually giving up her roommates and trying to get her parents to change her mind. It\u2019s probably best to get it over with.", "How do we know that OP is moving out at 18? Plenty of kids stay home after graduation to attend a local college, go straight into the work force etc. This child is a human being too. Are you suggesting that this child share a room with their parents until their older siblings move out?", "Things they should've considered before having another", "Apparently 2/3rds of babies sleep 8-9 hours continuously at 6 months. It's not rare.\n\nAnd whether the baby sleeps or not, for SIDS prevention it's recommended that they share a room with their parents for the first year.", "They should be the ones to make sacrifices not their child....they can do whatever they want. They are still the AHs", "And yet they want to give a whole room to a 2 month old? Like, what the heck.", "I\u2019ve seen babies sleep through Super Bowl parties. And overstuffing a house isn\u2019t good parenting", "Why is the baby prioritised over the teenagers tho? The baby dont need a whole ass room. Be reasonable. \n\nIt's so annoying to see parents that care more about their kids when they are babys than teenagers. Yikes", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one. lol.", "lol. Just saying. Seems like you\u2019re arguing awfully hard for something that the parents would that\u2019s a complete bullshit thing to do. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If it was or wasn\u2019t, that\u2019s not the fault of OP. They should\u2019ve figured it out and not by removing OP from their bedroom.", "I see your point but OP would be just as angry and she would spend the next year complaining about the inevitable change", "Or is leads to damaging their relationships between op and her parents. For seeing her old room not being used but being forces to share will cause resentment.", "Sure, it's very common to have good sleepers. It's also very common to have bad sleepers. I had one of each. A lot of people draw that short straw. From my experience with friends and family, I'm skeptical of that 2/3rds number, and I'm more inclined to believe it's closer to 50/50. But even if it's 2/3rds, a third of all babies is a lot of babies.", "SIDS protection factors don\u2019t stack and offering a pacifier for every sleep has been shown to protect from SIDS more than roomsharing.", "Yes because the infant will be home all day compared to OP who probably divides her day between school, her friends and maybe some extracurricular activities. The baby will get far more use out of that room than OP will.", "When my brother was an infant, my parents would go bowling on occasion. Mom said he was out like a light in 5 minutes once they got there. It was only when they got back to a nice quiet home that he'd wake up and cry lol.", "Infants or one year olds? They're not the same. Infants can sleep through anything, it's true.\n\nAnd having three kids split two rooms isn't \"overstuffing a house.\" \n\nI gotta know more about you. How old are you? Are you a parent? Do you have siblings? Do you think siblings sharing rooms is uncommon? Are you wealthy? Your point of view feels so alien to me.", "It's not about caring about one kid more or less, it's about trying to best meet the needs of the kids involved. Frankly, I think that a quiet place for a baby is more important than a teenager's right to their own bedroom.", "1) You don't know that.\n2) It's honestly pretty stupid to have  two teens, one of whom may even move to a dorm or another city soon, for about a year so that a 1 to 2 year old baby can have it's own room.", "OP is going to be resentful either way. She doesn\u2019t want to give up her room.", "Even if a baby is a bad sleeper, the current recommendation is that they sleep in a separate bed in the parental room for the first year to prevent SIDS. It wouldn't hurt the parents to keep the baby in their room a bit longer past that and then OP will be off to uni and her room will be freed up for the baby.\n\nEdit to add: It's also way more convenient to do night time feedings and changings when the baby is in the same room. I don't know why anyone would think it's better to have to go further to check on the baby in the middle of the night (and possibly miss some of the baby's cries for assistance).", "Siblings sharing a room isn't uncommon- completely losing your personal space and privacy at 16 and 13 is a huge shift though, and it's likely not in their best interests in terms of development and mental health.  Had they always shared, it wouldn't be such an issue, as it won't be such a shock to the system.  \nI don't envy OP's parents once the fighting starts. Hard enough to have 2 teenage girls under the same roof, but in the same room? Yikes. My sister and I would have murdered eachother.   \nOP's parents are doing a shitty job of parenting. Maybe they should have made sure they had the space for a new baby without disrupting the lives of the kids they already have before deciding to squeeze another one out.", "3 > 2, simple math is simple. And if it wasn\u2019t overstuffing, there wouldn\u2019t be people saying so in a Reddit post about it, smart guy.\n\nI\u2019m selling my autobiography on Amazon, go look for it there"]}
