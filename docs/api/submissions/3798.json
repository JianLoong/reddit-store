By the time they really need one you should be off to college, or pretty close. At that point I think you'll have to kiss the room good bye.

NAH, once the baby moves out of your parent's room it makes more sense to have the two of you with similar schedules in one room, and the baby with radically different needs in another.  And it makes sense that you're resentful about it.  It is a shame your parents' family planning worked out this way.", "NAH, I get that it sucks, but its honestly not up to you, and while the baby is best of roomsharing to start, your parents are going to want their space back eventually, and its their right to rearrange the sleeping arrangements as they see fit (within reason). \n\nWhile there is obviously a limited number of rooms available, maybe there's some wiggle room to negotiate with.

That\u2019s a difficult age to have little privacy. \n\nA baby will wake up every couple of hours for the first year of its life; their stomachs are very small and they need frequent meals. Your parents WILL be getting up with the baby all through the night for quite a while. Some studies have also shown it can decrease the risk of SIDS when the baby rooms with the mother.\n\nIf you plan to go to college or move out at 18, your little sibling will have a readily available room at that time. You can make the case to your parents that they put it off until then. But if not, at the end of the day, they are the adults and it\u2019s their house.", "NAH. I'm so sorry that this situation sucks, probably for mom just as much as you. She knows that you two are closer in age and neither of you need to share with a baby.

But it can also be fun too.\n\nYour little sibling when they are an infant and then toddler is going to be loud, messy, have an irregular sleep schedule, chaotic, and just generally actually will need its own space to do those things in. They will disrupt whoever they share their space with a lot more than the people in the replies and you seem to realize. \n\nIn a perfect world, all parents would have a room for every kid but the idea of kids sharing rooms is not this new or extreme thing. \n\nJust a quick note -  since \"you ***have*** to have privacy as a teen\" is the big thing being tossed around, wait'll you learn that 18-20-year-olds are forced to share a room in college...", "For all the people saying that a baby doesn\u2019t need it\u2019s own room, you are totally correct, it doesn\u2019t.

I bet OP will be DELIGHTED when they have to share their room with a toddler ESPECIALLY when they\u2019re teething or toilet training.\n\nTrust me, it\u2019s FAR better for OP to move in with their teenage sister than a toddler.

(well, there's an argument your parents should take that on, but that would be an uphill battle and you're going to want them to get as much sleep as they can when they have a baby so they can be better parents for you, too.) sorry about this situation, op. really not ideal. but i think you'll have to give it up and share with your sister.", "NTA.", "NTA, but think this through.

When you chose to have children you take the rough and the smooth, and it\u2019s their responsibility to accommodate everyone and that obviously includes you and your sister. You\u2019re both at important schooling ages so quiet study space is more important for you two, as a baby is not going to notice whether they\u2019re in their own room, or their parents room as long as it\u2019s a relaxed enough space for them to get all their much needed sleep in - which, again, is down to your mum and dad.

And OP's parents are under no obligation to make *three* people share a room so that OP can have one to herself? Especially to keep doing it whether or not it works for everyone else until OP leaves for college. Why exactly is OP more important then three other family members? \n\nFor a different perspective, when I had my first they had their own room (moved in overnight at 5 months). When I had my second we had to room share until 1.5 beacuse it was a two bedroom place and we didn't want her waking her big sister. I found it incredibly inconvenient and everyone, including the wee one, got less sleep. It was much easier for the older kid with their own room to learn to sleep all night, and once we moved to a three bedroom place her sleep got so much better. Also, it meant both adults couldn't use our room or any space in it to do things we liked to do past 6:30pm every single day. We had to move both of our desks out into the living room, or we wouldn't have been able to do anything. And if one parent needs their computer in an isolated space to work sometimes, than that's really a problem. Also, I as a mother always woke up from small sounds and stuff the baby makes, so I did not go back to getting a really good nights sleep for 1.5 bleeping years until baby got their own room. \n\nI'm not saying it wasn't great for you.

Mom and dad already share a room. You're suggesting that for two years three people share a room, just so OP can have one all to herself?

That's what you'd say if it was OP owned the house and a pregnant couple wanted to move in and take her room. \n\nBut you do realize this is the pregnant couple's house right? So yes, it's their job to find a place for their baby to live. And they have. *In their house.* When OP says it's \"her\" room you realize it's actually her parents room and they are currently letting her stay there? So, it is her problem if they stop letting her stay in that room, since they own the house and get to decide. \n\n>Why can't they put the child's crib in their own room for a couple of years? I presume to ensure their own comfort, whilst bulldozing over yours?\n\nSo if you have a family of 5 and 3 bedrooms, you would put 3 people in one room so that the other two could get individual rooms? That makes sense to you?\n\nI have raised a baby both with their own room, and with the second child in our room until 1.5 years. Part of why we moved is for us, that wasn't working well. It negatively impacted the sleep of both the adults and the toddler, who started sleeping so much better once they got their own room. Also, it gave us more room for the toddler to have her own dresser, toys, and a toddler bed which didn't fit in mom and dad's room. It's like you don't think OP's sibling is also a person? And they don't matter too? Suggesting the toddler be stuck in the small corner of a three person room for \"a few years\" so princess OP can have her own room is odd to me. \n\nCouldn't we by your logic say \"it's not babies fault mom and dad choose to have a teenager. Not baby's problem. Get out OP\"?", "They also pay the rent.

But defending it as \u201cjust being part of the family\u201d is very wrong.", "Except it's not absurd if the child is under the pressure and expectation of fulfill a more active role for their you get sibling - I'm sorry you had such a harsh and unstable childhood and is clear your mom was doing her best, but still things that you call tiniest bit can leave long lasting harm to a child's mental health. Just because someone has cancer, it doesn't mean your broken arm is gonna hurt less.", "Dirty dishes is theoretically something everyone is contributing to, so expecting kids to help out there makes total sense. \n\nNobody but the parents contributes to popping out babies, they get to have all the fun doing childcare.", "THE LICKING!!!! Oh my god! Hubby's dog was a dachshund & she'd start licking her paw....drove me nuts \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 she'd either stared from the foot of the bed or laid on her bed & licked her damn paw. Little shit knew what she was doing \ud83e\udd23", "I had to share a room till I was 25 because I couldn't afford it. Spoiled brats all over here.", "Fucking THANK YOU. The people acting like the parents are assholes here are blowing my mind. It's completely normal kids to share a room and it's not going to kill OP.", "As parents it\u2019s your job to raise a kid and provide necessities, love, and the skill set so they can be ready for adulthood. Halloween costumes, camp fees, vacation, and fancy toys are NOT necessities", "I honestly think chores are great because it teaches kids how to do things and be independent. I have always been extremely self-sufficient, but my friends who had parents that did everything for them really struggled out on their own. One person in particular almost caught a toaster oven on fire because they put\u2026 a STYROFOAM PLATE in it", "You\u2019re not required to wipe your ass after your shit but the consequence is you will smell like shit. You made a stupid argument.", "Have a puke bucket nearby.", "He's lucky, long as I manage to last another 6ish months we will be done with diapers! So he's good there. If he lost me though he'd probably kill all three of them with his cooking anyways.\n\nHonestly though, my FIL is our roomy so they'd all be okay even if I disappeared tomorrow.", "He'd probably have his mom move in to do the gross childcare stuff until he finds a new mommy for the kids. And does she ever get to spend more than a few hours away from her kids at a time? How has he never had to change a single diaper?", "There is a world of difference between helping out and parentification and the vast majority of people who throw that word around don\u2019t have a clue what real parentification looks like."]}
