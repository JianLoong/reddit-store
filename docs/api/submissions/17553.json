She sets a few alarms in the morning to make sure that she doesn\u2019t sleep through them, but there has been once or twice where I\u2019ve had to go in and wake her up because she has slept through them. \n\nI heard one of her alarms go off and she didn\u2019t hit it so I knew that she wasn\u2019t getting up, but I decided not to wake her and see how long she sleeps until she wakes up and realises how late she is. Fast forward a while and I finally hear her getting up, and she comes running down the stairs yelling at me asking why I didn\u2019t wake her up, and I told her that I\u2019m not always going to be there so she needs to learn to be responsible. \n\nShe was frantically running around the house trying to get her stuff together to go and once she was finally ready, she asked me if I could drive her down to work because it\u2019s around a 10/15 minute walk.

It's beneficial.  It serves as a reminder that they have to make sure they have alarms set and that they are loud enough.\n\nBut once you refused to drive her...you crossed over from a teaching moment to you just enjoying causing her stress.  Which is proven by the fact you said you found it funny\n\nIt wasn't funny\n\nNothing was funny about this interaction\n\nYou took what could have been a valuable life lesson and made it a cruel memory of the time her father reveled in her panic and fear.\n\nNot cool dude.  Not cool.", "YTA \n\nThe main thing your kid learned from that is that you\u2019re not there for her.", "I'm going to have to say YTA on this one. \n\n>I\u2019m not always going to be there so she needs to learn to be responsible.\n\nCorrect, you're not always going to be there, but she is still a teen who is adjusting to these things. You should be here for her *now* while you can. She was being responsible by setting a few alarms. She does not expect you to wake her up instead of the alarms. \n\n>I told her that I wasn\u2019t driving her anywhere and she\u2019s going to have to walk it, because again, I\u2019m not not always going to be here\n\nBy the time that you aren't going to be there for her, she most likely would have a car of her own. So refusing to even drive her, making her even later, seems to be just out of spite. \n\n>I found the whole thing quite amusing\n\nThis one sentence to me proves your TA. I'm unsure how your daughter being tired, rushing to work, being late, and asking for your help is in any way funny to you. I could get trying to help her be prepared for adult life, but it's not a  funny situation.", "If it has never happened before... this feels like you went a bit out of your way to teach her a lesson. It is the *'I found the whole thing quite amusing*' that kind pushes me to that. I think that letting her sleep through the alarm was fine... *but* you should have then given her a ride making clear it was a one time thing. Certainly glad you weren't my dad. YTA.", "YTA. Yes, she needs to learn to be responsible. However, you have helped her out a few times in the past, and it seems like there was never a conversation where you told her you won\u2019t be waking her up anymore. It sucks to just rip the training wheels off on your kid like that. She\u2019s still learning, so work with her rather than against her.", "YTA, it sounds like she is responsible, she just made a mistake today, and you didn\u2019t help her when you easily could have.", "YTA. \n\nYou said she usually manages herself, so oversleeping was clearly an accident and something that has \u201conly happened once or twice\u201d. What are you teaching her to be responsible for? Making the occasional mistake? Pretty sure that, like any adult, she will continue to make the odd error.\n\nThe reason your daughter overslept wasn\u2019t because she\u2019s irresponsible; she almost never oversleeps, and even set multiple alarms to mitigate the possibility of that happening. So why did she oversleep? Because shit happens. Sometimes you do everything right, and things still go wrong. And when they do, it\u2019s nice to have loved ones who actually give enough of a shit to help you out. It\u2019s a shame your daughter didn\u2019t. \n\nI just hope that if you ever dare to sleep through your alarm, your family refuse to wake you up.", "YTA. This could be a good lesson if you\u2019d warned her. As it is, you changed your behavior and then laughed at her for being late and negatively impacting her performance and reputation at work. You modeled being both irresponsible and inconsiderate.", "YTA. Teaching her responsibility is important but when she tried to salvage the situation by asking you for help, you were cruel and dismissive. Asking you for a ride is her way of problem solving and dealing with it. Why is she not allowed to ask for help?\n\nYou found it amusing?  What\u2019s wrong with you?", "YTA. I hate this kind of parenting style.", "YTA she\u2019s 17. That\u2019s something teens do. It wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal to wake her up. You\u2019re supposed to have her back. You let her get in trouble at work because instead of helping her out when she needed it you tried to teach her a bs lesson", "YTA, she set the alarms and didn\u2019t wake up for them, maybe she stayed up too late I don\u2019t know. Your excuse that \u2018you won\u2019t always be there\u2019 is stupid because you WERE there, you also then refused to drive her to work for the same reason again, and again, you WERE there. What you did was cruel and unnecessary.", "YTA for doubling down and not driving her. She's 17, this is how she learns. Punishment/shame does not teach. You can teach while at the same time support her.", "YTA, you say yourself your daughter takes measures to avoid oversleeping and this doesn\u2019t happen often. This \u201clesson\u201d was unnecessary and cruel. Refusing to drive her was over the top and your \u201camusement\u201d is even more AHish. Sometimes people need help. Teens oversleep and sometimes adults do too. Would you be upset if your wife noticed you overslept and decided it should be a \u201clesson\u201d to not wake you?", "YTA. This is not top Dadding. You could have given her a lift and still taught her about responsibility.", "I truly don\u2019t understand those saying NTA here. Sure, there\u2019s a lesson, but there also should be communication, and kindness. Why should we find humor in others\u2019 troubles?", "YTA You absolutely know why. She would have still learned her \"lesson\" if you drove her.  \nUnless the real lesson was \"don't ever expect my help\", in which case mission accomplished. \nI bet when you need her help down the road you will still expect it though.", "YTA.  While it is true that you will not always be there, you taught her that lesson in a pretty cruel way.  Waking her up, and then later on having a conversation about what happened (did she forget to set enough alarms, stay up too late, etc) and what she can do to be more responsible would have been good.  Instead you just stood around and let her fail, especially when waking her up would have been 30 seconds of effort.", "YTA - \"I found the whole thing quite amusing but it apparently wasn\u2019t as funny to the either of them.\" for this alone. You said yourself she has been doing well at this new job, so clearly she does have an understanding of responsibility. Instead of celebrating her drive when most kids I know that are her age haven't even tried to get a job, you decided to amuse yourself by 'teaching her a lesson\". The lesson was taught when you knowingly let her oversleep, but you had to go the extra mile and refuse to give her a ride. It's not like she stayed up until 3am and didn't set alarms. Alarms just do not work for some people, especially teenagers. I was heading into my 30s before I could rely on an alarm clock actually waking me up, and I set 3 of them with one being across the room so I would have to get out of bed to turn it off, so it had nothing to do with responsibility. All you taught her is she can't rely on you when she needs you. And that you find it amusing to set her up for failure.", "YTA \n\nWhat is wrong with you? Stuff happens and family helps and support each other. Only lesson here is what here father is self important AH and should be avoided.", "She's 17. She's your kid. This is her first job. You're a tremendous AH.", "I understand that there's a lesson here, but this was NOT the right way to impart it. You were more focused on \"teaching her a lesson\" than actually helping your daughter when she needed you--for something that would be easy for you to do, yet has big implications for her. All you're doing is breeding resentment, and it definitely is not funny. YTA", "YTA for not driving her to work.  \n\n\nShe's 17. The \"teaching moment\" is that she needs to wake herself up for work. Unless there was some reason you couldn't drive her to work - a project that had to be finished, a meeting you were due to have that conflicted - you could have driven her to work.", "YTA. She's 17 and presumably still in high school. I thought it was odd when my SIL refused to wake my niece up for her college classes resulting in my niece being kicked out of her program. This was college and she was an adult (and stayed up until 5am on her phone, but I digress). You could've driven her while still teaching her responsibility.", "YTA.  You could have told her you would drive her this one time.  What do you do when it's raining?  Do you not drive her then because then she wouldn't learn a lesson about what rain is like?", "YTA\n\nDo you even LIKE your daughter?  \nYou said it yourself, she usually manages on herself, would it kill you to help your 17 y-o daughter for once?", "Yta a lesson is great- rushing around in the morning to get ready is the lesson for sleeping through their alarm.\n\nYou also taught them another lesson- dad can't be relied on to help.\n\nAnd don't need surprised when she throws those words back in your face when *you* fuck up and need help.", "YTA", "YTA. Sure you won't always be there to wake her but you were there that day. Stop being a shitty parent because you think it'll teach her some lesson. The only thing it will teach her is you are unreliable", "YTA. You wouldn\u2019t even drive her to work. Nice dad.", "ESH - it is understandable that you are trying to teach your daughter responsibility but you went about it a bit harshly, and could have potentially caused a bad situation at her work. Your daughter, who is 17, with a job, also should not be relying on other people to wake her up for work as you are right - you might not always be there to do it, and it IS her responsibility. \n\nAlso, I don't see what's funny but humour is subjective...", "YTA. My husband, a grown ass man, sets alarms for himself when he has to be up early. Sometimes (not very often), he sleeps through the alarm. I'm usually up early so if he is not up when I know he should be I poke in and make sure he is awake. \n\nThis is one of those situations where you can be right and still be an asshole. Does she need to be able to get herself up in the morning? Of course! But it takes 2 seconds to go in and say hey you slept through your alarm... and maybe give her a warning if you're not willing to continue doing that in the future!", "YTA. You can be responsible but not be perfect about it. This was something small you could have easily helped with and you refused\u2014repeatedly. You were deliberate in hearing her alarm, sitting and waiting for her to react to it, and doing nothing, and then continued to be of no help.", "YTA\n\nYeah, you're not always going to be there... but this time, YOU WERE. \n\nThe fuck. That's just mean", "YTA. You know she has problem waking up and sets several alarms. What you just taught her is that you\u2019re not helping your family nor how to be kind. You can\u2019t be trusted, that\u2019s what your behaviour says. Teenagers having trouble getting up in the morning has nothing to do with them being lazy, they have another circadian rhythm than adults and that will change regardless is you think you \u201cteach\u201d her to it or not.", "i was all NTA about this because it's her job and she needs to learn how to make sure she will be a reliable and responsible adult. a huge part of having a job is just consistently showing up on time. \n\nbut the fact that you think it's funny is major AH behavior.", "NTA she\u2019s 17.  She should have SOME responsibility.", "NTA. It sounds perfectly reasonable to me that you let her sleep through her alarms. Wakingup and getting to where you need to be is an important lesson for a person to learn, and it's better that they learn it as a teenager then when they're actually on their own, supporting themselves. I probably would have driven her, but I'm a soft touch.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's low risk. She's a teenager with a high school job, and it's not like being late for work or getting fired is going to ruin her life. And it's important for her to learn this lesson now, at the high school job that doesn't matter, before she gets out into the adult world where the stakes are higher.", "NTA.  Seventeen is old enough to get up on her own.  She hopefully learned this lesson.", "NTA, learning to be on time is an essential life skill. Better to learn it at 17 than later in life. She also needs to learn she can\u2019t rely on people being responsible for things she needs to be responsible for (waking up on time and transportation).", "NTA\n\nShe needs to learn a bit of responsibility", "NTA, you are trying to teach her responsibility. As a dad you are just doing your job. Mom needs to also do her job as a mother. Your wife and daughter ATA's here. Wifey should have agreed with you on this one.", "NTA. I know many others are voting otherwise but I don't think you are. \n\nYour daughter needs to learn real-life consequences. It's better that she does it now before she is out on her own. You've woken her up in the past, and it wasn't malicious that you didn't wake her up. She is nearly an adult, has an alarm, it's her responsibility.", "NTA. I tell my 21 year old son who still lives with us the same thing. It's no longer my responsibility to wake him up. And if he insists on tell me I have to help him, well, he simply won't like my solution to waking him up. Which is to get a pitcher of ice water and dump it on him. I did NOT do it. but I threatened to do it if he wants me wake up. That shut it down pretty quick and now he gets up himself.", "NTA actions have consequences. Now, if she had asked you the night before to wake her that would be different. I probably would have said \u201c hey, I\u2019m NOT going to wake you anymore \u201c  the last time I woke her. Since you had done it before she likely had the expectation  that you would do it again.", "NTA - Thats part of the responsibility of having a job. You and the mom wont always be there to make sure she is awake so she needs to figure it out now.", "I'd like to know if this keeps happening or not. She's nearly an adult, and getting up is her responsibility.\n\nnta", "NTA.  Yep, I\u2019ve got the 17 y/o that sleeps through 2 alarms.  I\u2019ve told her that I\u2019ve been there/done that and I know 2 things that help and she can take it or leave it.  1) get to sleep earlier & 2) get up when the first alarm goes off.  I\u2019ve explained before now that a person is as responsible as they choose to be and nobody gets to play the woe is me card in my house.  I\u2019m responsible for my job and she\u2019s responsible for hers.  As for wife\u2026.how would she respond to 17 y/o if the situation was going to college classes that she was paying for or if 17 y/o were her employee?", "NTA\n\nAdults have to be responsible with our time.  She has to learn to do so.  At 17, she is more than capable of ensuring she is on time to her job.  \n\nNow, should you have driven her?  Yea.  Not doing so was just a kick in the gut when she was already down.  For that you are an asshole.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nShe's 17, very nearly an adult. The only one responsible for her not waking up is herself.", "NTA. She's 17. At that age, I'd moved out of home, had a job & was paying rent. It was my responsibility to get up in the morning & go to work.", "Overall NTA, because your daughter does need to learn to be accountable for her own responsibilities. But not driving her to work was a major dick move", "NTA. It was an important life lesson, and kudos to OP for not enabling his daughter.\n\nThe fact that his daughter sets multiple alarms and sleeps through them indicates to me that her behavior in this incident is not a first time offense, just the first time since she started working.\n\n She CHOOSES not to get up when her alarm first goes off and waits for one of the next ones before she bothers to start her day. And if you want to argue that she doesn't hear it because her alarm doesn't wake her, she needs to turn up the volume. \n\nIt's called personal responsibility.", "YTA but I\u2019d do the same thing", "Lol..

Massive parenting fail here, dude.", "YTA - imagine having two parents in this world and one of them is you. I hope she teaches you lessons like this when you are in an old folks home. \"I found the whole thing quite amusing\". You are going to be so alone when you are older.", "Did you ever tell her that you were not going to wake her if she slept through her alarm? Lessons need to be set up. You didn\u2019t set up the lesson. You just threw her into the deep end of the pool hoping she learned to swim.", "YTA \n\nYou said she\u2019s doing pretty well at the job.\n\n Let me tell you something about teenage brains that\u2019s a fact. They need to sleep a lot of sleep and and it\u2019s not uncommon for them to sleep through alarms like that. You could\u2019ve gone and woken her up and then you were even more of an AH by not driving her to work. \n\nI mean your first line says it\u2026.she\u2019s doing pretty good so you just thought you would double down on the punishment over an alarm she didn\u2019t hear?  I am telling you she didn\u2019t hear it she didn\u2019t do it on purpose!  If she was going out late all night partying with her friend and not getting up that\u2019s a whole different situation.  \n\nThere\u2019s something about you\u2026.you\u2019re a little bit sadistic thinking that was something you enjoyed. This is your daughter.\n\nYTA", "YTA", "But you were there. All she\u2019ll remember is you trying to teach a lesson, that she couldn\u2019t count on you. YTA", "YTA", "YTA I get what you were trying to do but when you also wouldn\u2019t drive her you crossed the asshole line. She will respond the same when you need help", "YTA sleeping through her alarm and the resulting panic was the lesson. The only thing your AH attitude taught her is that she owes you no favours.", "YTA\n\nAbsolutely understand wanting to teach her to be independent. But you crossed into asshole land when you refused to drive her AND \u201cfound it funny\u201d. You found her frantic and nervous energy funny?! Hope that energy is returned to you tenfold the next time you aren\u2019t perfect at life.", "YTA. I think part of being a family and a parent is having your child\u2019s back and it seems like you watched her flail for fun rather than to teach her a lesson. All you\u2019ve taught her is she can\u2019t depend on you, and I wouldn\u2019t expect her to go out of her way for you in the future.", "YTA. A lesson can still be a lesson without negatively impacting her life and her opinion of you. I can't imagine ever doing this to my kids, especially without warning. I mean, even coming in with water to splash on her to wake her up would have been better.", "YTA. I think she learned multiple lessons from this, at least one of them about you", "YTA simply because it seems you don't like your daughter much and enjoy her distress.", "You're not always going to be there for her? You aren't there for her now, YTA.", "She learned a lesson.  She learned that her father gets smug satisfaction knowing he can help someone but enjoys withholding that help just to\nFeel Powerful and superior.  \n\nThat\u2019s why you were amused\u2014you liked feeling calm and in control while you watched your daughter struggle.  \n\nWhat a hostile, cold, unloving response.  \n\nYou Weren\u2019t kind\u2014this is how you hope your wife and daughter would react if you overslept?   \n\nI hope you remember that the next time you need a hand from Someone else.  \n\nAnd have fun five years from Now trying to figure out why your colleagues throw you under the bus for any minor mistakes, or why your daughter is distant and your wife spends most of her time With her friends.   Good luck with that attitude and smugness.", "YTA.\n\nIt's so odd when parents use the excuse, \"they need to learn because I'm not always around\". Duh, the aim of parenting is to help you child learn to be independent, but I agree with others, it stopped being a learning moment when she asked for a ride, that was her trying to figure out a back up plan, and you took it as her asking you to save the day or something. I hope it was just a one time thing of watching your daughter panic like this, but the way you say it was amusing has me thinking it's probably not.\n\n*Let teens experience the consequences of their actions, but the moment you typed that you found your daughters panic ammusing solidified the judgment for me.*\n\nOP, I really hope this was a lapse in judgement and not a greater reflection on how you treat your daughter or else I hope you're putting money away for a retirement home now. Gotta figure it how to take care of yourself because your might not always be around.", "Honestly NTA. As someone who has had this happen and my dad did the exact same thing, it was a lesson learned. To me this is teaching responsibility.", "I mean, this is what my Dad would have done.  She sets alarms, she knew she had to get up.  She wasn't relying on Mom or Dad and then the rug got yanked out from under her.   I think you might be teetering on the edge of T A  here with this part, though:  \"I found the whole thing quite amusing but it apparently wasn\u2019t as funny to the either of them. \"  *If she's late, upset, and asking you for help while you're laughing in her face, then yeah, you're T A.*   This is something that will get funny with time, after the lesson is learned, not in the moment.  \n\nBut just for making her responsible for herself when she's nearly an adult with little to no consequences?  That's just parenting.  Just in this instance, though.  Now if this were a high stakes moment, like, she's got an exam in twenty  minutes that's worth 80% of her grade, that's one thing.  But if it's just one day she's late and it's not a habit she's going to lose her job over.... lesson learned.  She'll learn, in a small, mundane example - that she is responsible for herself.  She's the one who has to make it her business to get the things she wants.", "YTA \n\nYou've got a kid who is earning money with a part-time job and is habitually on time. She overslept, which happens to the best of us, and is frantic because she is normally on time and clearly cares about her job.\n\nYou screwed her over to \"teach her a lesson\" and laughed at her.  The only thing she's learned is that you can't be trusted or relied on. What a great moment for your father daughter relationship. \n\nYou're a fucking prick and a bad father.", "NTA\n\nWelcome to adulthood!  It can suck sometimes!", "I was prepared to throw down an E.S.H. or N.T.A., but my word. This *amused* you? You found her worry and her panic\u2026*entertaining?* She\u2019s seventeen, this is her first job, and as you say yourself she has been proactive about ensuring she doesn\u2019t oversleep! Do you just lurk around waiting for everyone you know to misstep for a laugh? Sheesh. YTA for sure, and possibly a prolapsed one.", "\u2018I won\u2019t always be here\u2019 way to let her know that you\u2019re unreliable even when you are around YTA", "YTA", "YTA\n\nInstead of worrying about what she does when you\u2019re not here, why don\u2019t you help her while you ARE here? That\u2019s such a lame excuse anyways. You just found it funny to watch her mess up. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal if you just let her sleep too late. Once you refused to drive her, you became an AH. You wanted to make sure she was late. Instead of teaching her a lesson, you just made yourself look like an ass.", "Wow.  This is so sad to read.  YTA and I feel like this is a fail as a parent.  Your job is to be a provider and protector for your family.  You didn\u2019t wake her up and then causing her to be frantic and panic.  That was lesson enough, but to then decline to give her a ride, and then take that even further by finding amusement in the situation is just horrible.  \n\nWhat kind of father takes pride and pleasure in causing their child additional angst?  She is 17 and still a child learning to be responsible by getting a job, doing good work there, setting her alarms, etc. and instead of supporting her you decide she needed to learn a bigger lesson of how not to count on dad.  Why did that have to be taught today?  Your punishment didn\u2019t really fit the crime and you double down by thinking it was funny.  \n\nI can\u2019t imagine my husband doing that to either of our kids and how hurtful that would\u2019ve been to them if we who should be their biggest supporter let\u2019s them down like that. YTA!!", "YTA. I'm guessing a lot of folks here thinks it's a teaching moment to let their kid burn their hand on a hot stove or play with the electrical socket. The only lesson learned is that she cannot trust you now. Seriously, that is it. She will not remember the reasons why she overslept but she for sure remember that her own dad had the opportunity to help and didn't.\n\nChildren are regular human beings that don't have all the proper tools in their tool belt yet. Your job as a parent is to give them those tools. I never teach with the word \"what\" in mind. I teach with the word \"why\". \"What\" happened was she overslept. I would have woken my child, let them know the situation and then addressed it after I helped them meet their responsibilities. When the day is done you can address the \"why\" since you already knew/know the what. See if she is staying up too late. Find out if she has a lot of homework and maybe a school/work/life balance lesson needs to be taught. She might be stressed or overwhelmed. She may just be staying up too late because she is 17. Or maybe, just maybe she fucked up and overslept that day (as if none of us have done that before). You do not know until you ask. The lesson you want to be able to teach in this scenario should have been that you will be there for your daughter until the day you are six feet under. What if she in the future gets into some sort of trouble and doesn't have a way out, do you think she will come to you? Do you think if she gets assaulted that she will have the trust to go to you? If she is at a party in the future and gets drunk, would she call you for a ride or drive home drunk so to not get into trouble. Surely you must remember what it's like to be a kid. There are a lot of teachable moments but the most important lesson is that you will be there for her through thick and thin. Lessons can still be learned without suffering the consequences. I know I went a bit extreme with my future scenarios but things like this do effect the kid and will effect her decisions on what to share with you and what to keep secret. You never want your child having to decide what to do in a bad situation knowing they can't trust their parent to help.", "I concur your honour...!", "THIS. This is spot on. YTA OP, because you just totally broke her trust by not giving her a ride. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be forced into this decision again.", "Yeah, can't wait until the daughter throws his words back im his face when he fucks up and needs her help.", "I don\u2019t get why he\u2019s saying he\u2019s teaching her how to be responsible, as though he\u2019s not also citing her as a teenager who has only overslept \u201conce or twice\u201d and sets multiple alarms to avoid oversleeping. What lesson is being taught here, exactly?", "My dad laughing at me over the years has only added to our distance. Perhaps his goal is to push the daughter away and prove that he is not trustworthy. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI don't know what else he thinks this will accomplish.", "Many people people on reddit make it their life's goal to give advice that would cause issues in families. They keep score cards for every update they get of families divorcing or people going no contact. You can tell who they are because they tend to base judgement on legality over morals and ethics.\n\nAlso you should put a space in N TA or the bot reads it as a vote.", "There\u2019s not even a lesson because the daughter doesn\u2019t oversleep all the time! This was just a bad morning for her not a regular thing.", "To me I say that, because this did happen to me once and it was a learning lesson. And it never happened again. I was around the same age as well and I literally read this in my dad\u2019s voice LOL", "Her his daughter wasn\u2019t relying on other people she set several alarms because obviously she does not hear them and wake up because you know what? That\u2019s what a teenage brain is like and they need their sleep. And you bypass him thinking this is amusing he\u2019s a full on TA.?", "There is a HUGE difference between a 17 y/o and a 21 y/o when it comes to a situation like this.", "I feel like the big difference here (outside of the age which others commented on) is that you *tell* your son. There is communication and he knows to expect this. OP didn't have any communication beforehand that he was going to do this, and had infact given the expectation of waking her as he had in the past. So he just did a 180\u00b0 with no warning or communication.", "Either way, he is TA. Look at everyone else's post, obviously, they bring up good points on why he is, and yet you choose to think because he's letting her be late to work, he's nta...", "She can't be human and make mistakes I guess. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "this, fucking this. \n\nwhen i got my first job after my mom threw me out of the house and I went to live with my dad, on the rare occasion I talked to my mother she would tell me it was stupid to keep applying to college because i already had a job.  \n\n\ny'all I was making 4.25 an hour back then.  \n\n\nWhen I got married all my mom wanted to know is why I hadn't quit my job since my ex husband had a job and could support met.

My SO has never met her, spoken to her and barely has any idea what she looks like.", "Yeah I don\u2019t think adults realize how hurtful their laughter can be. I came home from the ER with a broken wrist at nine y/o and my dad told me to take the trash out and just\u2026cackled when I couldn\u2019t lift the bags. I still hear that fucking laugh in my head. Don\u2019t know why. Just typing this makes me want to cry for some reason and that was almost thirty years ago now.", "Not only that it is proven fact that teenagers need to sleep and they go into deep sleep., she didn\u2019t do this on purpose, she just didn\u2019t hear her alarm he\u2019s such a big a hole especially since you thought it was amusing when it was actually cruel.", "As if it\u2019ll teach her to control her sleep! I overslept the other day, a shitty morning 20 years ago wouldn\u2019t help that.", "There really isn\u2018t. She has a job and it\u2019s her responsibility to get up in time, doesn\u2018t matter if she\u2019s 17 or 21.", "Yes, I realize that 21 is not 17, but how is a 17 year old going to learn to wake themselves up and be responsible if Daddy or Mommy always does it. \n\nAnd really there is only a 4 year age difference. Also 17 is one  year away from 18, where they are considered an adult.", "Yeah, I see your point. But to the Dad's point, he's not going to be around all the time to wake her up. She needs to start learning on her own.", "And yet a great way to help solve this problem is help her in the moment and then talk to hear about it after. There is likely something else going on if she's sleeping through alarms. \nGuess what, if you don't treat others like shit they'll respect you enough to listen when you help them figure out how to wake for an alarm.\nYtA and so is anyone agreeing with you.", "But her parents don't always wake her up, OP clearly states \"She sets a few alarms in the morning to make sure that she doesn\u2019t sleep through them, but there has been once or twice where I\u2019ve had to go in and wake her up because she has slept through them.\" It's not even a case where she turned the alarms off then went back to bed, she literally didn't hear them to wake up. I have never understood the mentality that not hearing an alarm equates to being lazy and/or irresponsible. OP should be grateful his 17-year-old wants to work and not just lay around playing on her phone all day."]}
