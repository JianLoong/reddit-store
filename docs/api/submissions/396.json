He\u2019s a real sweetheart, and if he had it his way he\u2019d be carried around in my arms all day long + only put down when we come across a cool bug.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t talk very often, it\u2019s something that I was worried about in the beginning because as a young mom I worried about almost everything, but the pediatrician told me that he\u2019ll likely become more talkative over time. I\u2019m currently looking into speech therapists just to see if that will help a bit, and we\u2019re currently learning sign language too so Cass can switch to that when he doesn\u2019t feel like using his voice.\n\nHe\u2019s such a smart kid, and he\u2019s so curious about everything. All he ever wants to do is explore and learn about new things. I\u2019m so proud of him and I love being his mom and getting to see the world through his eyes.\n\nMy mom (50f) doesn\u2019t like the approach I\u2019ve taken to my son\u2019s tendency to not speak very often. There have been a few times where he\u2019ll clearly be asking for something, and she\u2019ll refuse because he isn\u2019t using his voice. It\u2019s one of the main reasons why I never ask her to babysit, bc it bothers me when she does that and I stop it every time.\n\nWe were all at a restaurant with my step dad (55m), my step brother (30m), his wife (30f), and their son James (4m). When it came time to order, I read some options out to Cass and he signed yes for the meal he wanted. James spoke to the waiter on his own.\n\nWhen the waiter walked away my mom got upset with me, she said that because I\u2019m the parent, I need to tell Cass to get over his stubborn attitude about speaking and that his refusal to do so is ridiculous.\nMy stepdad then expressed concerns about the fact that James was saying full sentences by 2yrs old but Cass is 3 and he\u2019d only ever heard him say about five words.\n\nI told them both that I didn\u2019t appreciate them trying to have that conversation with me in front of Cass and at a family lunch but then my mom said that if Cass had an issue, he should use his voice to tell them that instead of relying on me to do it for him.\nI ended up flagging the waiter down and asking for my part of the bill and if I could get the food to-go because I didn\u2019t think it was fair for my son to have to sit there and listen to them talk about him like he couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying.\n\nOnce I paid and got the food, we went home. My mom texted me later saying that I\u2019m doing my son a disservice by not making him speak, that it was rude of me to leave lunch like that just because I didn\u2019t like the way the conversation was going and that it speaks to my immaturity.\n\nTruthfully if I had pushed him to do it, I know he would have verbalized what he wanted, but he clearly felt more comfortable signing so I didn\u2019t feel the need to do that. \n\nRegardless, was it an immature/AH move to leave like that?\n\nETA:\n- Cass is fully capable of speaking, he has said a full sentence before he just doesn't talk very often, and especially not in front of other people/in public.\n- Like I said, I've spoken to his pediatrician. I'm currently looking for speech therapists, and I've been thinking about getting him assessed for a while now, I'll just have to bring it up to the doctor.\n- Cass uses sign, he has vocab cards and flashcards, and he already knows how to spell all of his favorite words. We work on his words all the time, it's one of his favorite things to do.\n- No the bio dad isn't involved. It's just Cass and me.\n\nEdit pt.2\n\nI don't mean to sound defensive or anything but please read the first edit before telling me what I *should* be doing for my son. I have spoken to his doctor multiple times, I am looking for a speech therapist, I have been looking into getting him assessed, I offer him multiple different methods of communication, I encourage him to speak when I know he is comfortable doing so.\n\nAlso he knows more than five words. My stepfather just stated that he's only ever heard Cass say five words. Cass has a large vocabulary, he just doesn't verbalize it often.", "created_utc": 1667090972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh0c83/aita_for_leaving_in_the_middle_of_lunch_because_i/", "score": 4267, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It wasn't a conversation I was comfortable with having in front of my son, so I got up and left with him. My mom said it was rude and immature of me to leave the way I did.

The situations you are describing sound so familar to me. And the absolute worst thing you can do is try to push the issue and 'force' them to talk. Not only will it not work, it can make the issue worse. \nYou are doing right by your child. Your mother is being an ignorant AH.", "NTA. You're an excellent mom. Your mom however a total AH. \n\nYou're already a better mom than you ever had. You're a rockstar for not taking their manipulation and judgement.", "NTA. Pediatric occupational therapist here: introducing alternative speaking (sign, computer based speech, even pointing to cards) doesn\u2019t delay vocal speech- it just gives the child a chance to express themselves. Using alternative communication devices or signs decreases frustration, tantrums, meltdowns, and even depression in kiddos that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have their needs met or thoughts expressed.", "NTA \n\nHow awful for these adults to talk like that in front of your child. Do they think he can't hear or understand because he isn't verbal? You were right to leave and I would keep him away from your parents. Good on you for learning and teaching sign language. Being nonverbal doesn't mean he is not intelligent, and it doesn't mean he's being lazy.", "NTA. You are doing great, mom! These older generations really dislike it when they can't control kids and force them into submission. Your approach is MUCH healthier for your son.", "Psych here.\n\nYou're NTA. A crackdown approach will only increase your son's anxiety about speaking. Also, the \"normal\" range of speech is absolutely huge at age 3, so while obviously it's a good idea to consult a speech therapist to guide your decisions and any need for intervention, it's not the case that a 3 year old who doesn't speak much necessarily has a disorder.", "Rather ableist of your mom to act like signing isn't speaking - it's called sign LANGUAGE for a reason! And not only is it not constructive to compare the two kids' speech abilities, it's needlessly cruel to do it in front of them. You're exactly right, they're speaking about him like he can't understand. Again, that's also ableist because not speaking is obviously not the same as not hearing and comprehending!!\n\nNTA and good for you for setting this boundary. If they can't be polite and respectful of Cass they shouldn't be around him tbh", "NTA. It would probably be best to encourage him to use his voice in a setting where he feels most secure and comfortable. Not one where he is put on the spot.", "NTA... but your mother and father are!\n\nYou handled the situation beautifully. I'm dazzled! \n\nMy only suggestion is to shelve any second guessing of your instincts. You are doing it all right. Don't let anyone else make you question your parenting moves. \n\nI didn't speak until I was 2, and even then not very much. My brother, on the other hand, was speaking in full sentences at 12 months. My mom was concerned and actually had me evaluated for mental disability, which is still a fun family story. \n\nIt turns out that delayed speech can track with very low *and* very high IQ. I was glad my parents shared with me all of this when I was older because my first born didn't speak much either.\n\nBabies are who they are when they arrive. Your sweet boy isn't a big talker. He may be like me and my son and not think in words. Language is a construct we don't need to think our thoughts. We still manage to connect with others, speak when we want to, and live full, normal lives, but it would be diminished if we were forced to be something other than ourselves to suit our parents. \n\nDemanding he behave in a way that is out of his natural character is harmful. \n\nGosh you are such a good Mama. Thank you for protecting your baby boy.", "NTA. Also, I talked for my younger sister until she was about 4. She\u2019s the one who got a full ride to an Ivy League PhD program, not me.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you have consulted professionals about this, and they aren't concerned.\n\nYour mom and step dad are not experts in child development.\n\nTBH, this is getting into firm boundary territory if I were in your position. \"This is no longer a topic I will discuss with you, and I expect you to respect my parenting choices with my child. If you do not, do not expect to spend time with us any longer.\"\n\nGood on you for standing up for your son. Unfortunately it sounds like they still very much intend to keep pushing you about this, so be prepared for how you will deal with it. I think going low or no contact until they stop bringing it up and communicate with your child respectfully might be a good option.", "NTA. You are an awesome mum. Signing is perfectly good communication and if that works better for Cass then that works better. At least he is still able to express himself. I\u2019m sorry your parents are so unsupportive and judgemental. They are coming from a very old fashioned viewpoint and research now indicates that using sign helps develop speech of speech is going to develop.", "NTA.  You\u2019re taking a proactive approach, you\u2019ve consulted professionals and given your son a way to communicate that seems to be more comfortable for him.  Some kids are slower to really use their voices.  Some folks never speak much.  Part of the beauty of humanity is its variety.", "NTA  No matter what concerns they may have, it's never okay to be discussing that, in front of the children during what is supposed to be a relaxing time for all.  I can't blame you at all.  If they weren't going to stop the nagging, then you only had the choice between sitting and listening to it, or leaving and letting them chat amongst themselves.  I would have chosen to leave.\n\nThe goal is to make sure your child has no problems that stand in the way of his ability to hear, and communicate well with his peers.  That is where his pediatrician and teachers work with you as a team.  Beyond that, he will develop on his own timeline, in the way he feels comfortable doing.  My son and daughter each reached their milestones in their own unique way.  My daughter was very fast in reading, writing, fine motor skills.  Gross motor skills were slower.  My son was the opposite....language, reading and social skills were slower, but his gross motor skills were off the charts.  Both are now healthy, happy adults!\n\nSounds like your son is doing just fine.  You are a great mom!", "My kid didn\u2019t speak at all 3 and then all of a sudden was speaking full sentences. He still doesn\u2019t like telling people he is good at something till he has mastered it. NTA", "NTA.  Trying to force him or shame him will just backfire.  \n\nI understand that the pediatrician doesn't think it's a problem, but if you're to the point of looking into speech therapists you may want to look into early intervention through the school district you live in.  I think kids are eligible starting at age 3 and I believe they'll do an evaluation to determine if services are warranted.", "NTA They can give recommendations, but if you don't want those recommendations they need to mind their own business. The line of how much responsibility to give your child at a given is a subtle one and every one does it slightly differently.", "NTA \n\nAnd I have to give major props for providing so many methods of communication for your son. And abiding what he is comfortable. \n\nYou sound like an amazing, intelligent, compassionate person.\n\nPlease keep protecting your son and encouraging him.", "NTA, good for you to have your baby's back.\n\nEver though he may be neurodivergent btw? Might be a good idea to get through the diagnostic process if only so you can get him proper assistance when he's at school.", "NTA and if every child had a mum as understanding to their needs as you seem to be about your little boy, this world would be a much more empathetic and understanding place. These grown ups seem to think that he needs to live up to their expectations of the world instead of letting him develop at his own pace. You\u2019re doing a wonderful job.", "NTA. But please get your son evaluated now that he\u2019s three.\n\nYour mother had no right to speak to you that way, let alone at lunch in front of other members of your family, let alone in front of Cass. Leaving the lunch was the most respectful way to handle the situation.\n\nPushing him to speak in that environment wasn\u2019t going to do anything but stress him out.", "NTA", "I have a relative who didn't speak much at that age either. They recently graduated from an Ivy. Your family needs to stay in their lane. Even on the off chance that there is an issue, children should never be discussed where they can hear it. You absolutely did the right thing. I'd put them all on a time out until they grasp that they are never allowed to discuss your son in front of him and when you say stop, they need to pay attention.", "NTA but please get him into therapy. This can lead to issues in school. He needs to be able to carry on basics to communicate needs with other adults. Signed a mom who had a speech delayed child. This sounds a lot like selective mutism (not a doctor, just have a few friends kids with this.)", "NTA\n\nYour mother really needs to back off, and I'd recommend limiting contact with her until she can grasp the concept that she doesn't get to control the development of a child. \n\nYou're doing everything you should do. Others have already stated,  and I'm going to echo that certain children take a bit longer in their language development. It does not necessarily mean anything is wrong. Sometimes it means everything is right, and the kid is absorbing more than you think. \nI saw some people suggesting autism.  There would probably be other signs, and like aversion to certain sounds, textures and especially too many other people, (speaking from years of working with special needs kids) and if you're not seeing that, I wouldn't over think it too much -obviously not an official diagnosis,  but something I've learned/experienced.\n\nYou're doing wonderful by being such a beautifully supportive mother.", "INFO\n\n> I was worried about **in the beginning** because as a young mom I worried about almost everything, but the pediatrician told me that he\u2019ll likely become more talkative over time. I\u2019m **currently looking into** speech therapists just to see if that will help a bit\n\nI'm assuming this is going to be NTA, but help out a little with the timeline here.\n\n* How far back was this conversation with the pediatrician? \n\n* Did he give you any sense of a timeline for when you might want to get concerned, if you hadn't seen progress?\n\n* What exactly does \"looking into\" therapists mean? Have you made a decision about going this route and are just trying to find the right therapist, or what?\n\nIt certainly *sounds* like you're doing all the right things here.", "NTA in any way. I think you\u2019re a great mom for going the extra step to teach your child sign language, which is helpful to others who are hearing impaired. I think it\u2019s something that needs to be an option taught to children in school, just like French or Spanish. \n\nSo your child is non verbal. It could be a choice or something else. That\u2019s your business. You\u2019re handling it the way you choose and it\u2019s hurting absolutely no one. If Cass has taken to sign language and is comfortable with it that\u2019s great. That he enjoys it is even better. Grandma needs to get over her fear of abnormalities and stop alienating you and her grandson. He\u2019s old enough to start picking up on it and he doesn\u2019t need to start worrying over people at his age. One day he\u2019ll come across someone who requires ASL and he will definitely be glad to know the language and the other person will too. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.

He\u2019s a real sweetheart, and if he had it his way he\u2019d be carried around in my arms all day long + only put down when we come across a cool bug.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t talk very often, it\u2019s something that I was worried about in the beginning because as a young mom I worried about almost everything, but the pediatrician told me that he\u2019ll likely become more talkative over time. I\u2019m currently looking into speech therapists just to see if that will help a bit, and we\u2019re currently learning sign language too so Cass can switch to that when he doesn\u2019t feel like using his voice.\n\nHe\u2019s such a smart kid, and he\u2019s so curious about everything. All he ever wants to do is explore and learn about new things. I\u2019m so proud of him and I love being his mom and getting to see the world through his eyes.\n\nMy mom (50f) doesn\u2019t like the approach I\u2019ve taken to my son\u2019s tendency to not speak very often. There have been a few times where he\u2019ll clearly be asking for something, and she\u2019ll refuse because he isn\u2019t using his voice. It\u2019s one of the main reasons why I never ask her to babysit, bc it bothers me when she does that and I stop it every time.\n\nWe were all at a restaurant with my step dad (55m), my step brother (30m), his wife (30f), and their son James (4m). When it came time to order, I read some options out to Cass and he signed yes for the meal he wanted. James spoke to the waiter on his own.\n\nWhen the waiter walked away my mom got upset with me, she said that because I\u2019m the parent, I need to tell Cass to get over his stubborn attitude about speaking and that his refusal to do so is ridiculous.\nMy stepdad then expressed concerns about the fact that James was saying full sentences by 2yrs old but Cass is 3 and he\u2019d only ever heard him say about five words.\n\nI told them both that I didn\u2019t appreciate them trying to have that conversation with me in front of Cass and at a family lunch but then my mom said that if Cass had an issue, he should use his voice to tell them that instead of relying on me to do it for him.\nI ended up flagging the waiter down and asking for my part of the bill and if I could get the food to-go because I didn\u2019t think it was fair for my son to have to sit there and listen to them talk about him like he couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying.\n\nOnce I paid and got the food, we went home. My mom texted me later saying that I\u2019m doing my son a disservice by not making him speak, that it was rude of me to leave lunch like that just because I didn\u2019t like the way the conversation was going and that it speaks to my immaturity.\n\nTruthfully if I had pushed him to do it, I know he would have verbalized what he wanted, but he clearly felt more comfortable signing so I didn\u2019t feel the need to do that. \n\nRegardless, was it an immature/AH move to leave like that?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My parents denied everything and anything that could be \u201cabnormal\u201d for me.\n\nI was so talkative when I was younger but as I got older I stopped talking as much as I did. I got hard core bullied about everything about me. Now sometimes I get teased for speech, and grew extreme social anxiety.  \n\nWhenever I\u2019m out my parents force me into uncomfortable talking situations especially out with family friends for cultural celebrations and I break out into tears being in the situation that I\u2019m forced to. I know I have to face them but it\u2019s just really nerve-wracking being around people I\u2019m uncomfortable. I started being selectively mute and been spiralling into terrible mental health.\n\nI\u2019m (against my parents will) have been diagnosed with ADHD + social anxiety and general anxiety. I\u2019m (again against my parents idea that anything is wrong) am in therapy and I can\u2019t get another assessment now but suspected Autism, OCD and Depression. \n\nI hope you know that what your doing is amazing and to keep going forward<3", "Agreed.

I brought it up again because it was clear that he understood the different names for things, but he just wouldn't verbalize any of it. They said that if it persisted by the time he was 2 then I should start working with him more on vocabulary and things like that.\n\nEventually the Dr told me that he didn't think it was anything to be concerned about because Cass clearly does understand what is being said, and he has said a few words here and there. I was told that if by age 4 he still wasn't speaking very often, we'd talk more about assessments and things like that.\n\nI wanted to be proactive and look for speech therapists in the meantime just to see if maybe their method of working with him on vocab and encouraging him to speak would be more helpful to him than what I've been trying.", "^this.", "I read this as stepdad has only ever heard him say 5 words, not that the child only has 5 words in their vocabulary.", "Her second paragraph literally says that she is actively seeking help for her son.

A good SLP can do a thorough evaluation and see where you can start supporting your child.\n\nI also want to note that I am very glad parent is open to helping their child IF they are on the spectrum, based on her comments. Many parents choose denial at this age because it is easy to ignore when they are toddlers and they are scared of a diagnosis.

I\u2019m afab and with no developmental delays I slipped through the cracks. \n\nMoment school started it was then super obvious that I needed help but I just, didn\u2019t get it. My middle school even asked my parents in 7th grade if they would consider special ed since I was struggling. My parents didn\u2019t know enough about it at the time and refused. \n\nI only got a diagnosis because I was doing research in a class over it and every single criteria fit. Hard. \n\nIt still took me until I was a junior to get special Ed despite the fact I was floundering and the fact I could\u2019ve had support and help sooner but didn\u2019t simply because I fell through the cracks still deeply upsets me.", "Family friends' son was also having significant speech problems but his parents (their first child) didn't see it (didn't want to see it) so he was much later at getting diagnosed than he could have been. He's doing so well now that he's been diagnosed and is in great preschool for autistic children and I wish he could have had this experience a year earlier than he did. \n  \nWhile OP is NTA, I also wish she had a greater sense of urgency about getting her son diagnosed, whatever the diagnosis may be. A pediatrician doesn't spend a lot of time with the infant or toddler and is going a lot by what mom or dad is telling them which makes it easier for them to miss things that they might otherwise have seen.", "At the time I didn't know that it was the reason he was late in his speech but he didn't show any other symptoms  of autism and they just jumped into conclusion that he was autistic. It's after I talked to other bilingual parents that I realized their kids were also late in their speech", "Sure. Ask away.", "Lol my friend is one of the most spontaneous, cares to the wind kind of person I\u2019ve ever met! When they told me this story I was like \u201c\u2026 yeah sounds like you xD\u201d", "I was like your younger brother except when my older brother went to school, I actually had to ask for things if I wanted them.", "My colleague\u2019s 4-year-old didn\u2019t pick up so each milestones, and they started speech therapy and a couple other services when he was almost 2. He has the craziest vocabulary of any kid I\u2019ve ever met, and he never shuts up (in the best way possible) \ud83d\ude05", "I see you have watched the Kings Speech", "What? That's one of the methods being used to help with stuttering? It helped me insanely.", "Yep", "100%! It\u2019s amazing to me that parents don\u2019t know about the health services available to them for their kids.  My 8 year old son was 10 weeks preemie and had his life changed by OT PT and speech therapy at an early age.  Now he won\u2019t shut up! And this pediatrician saying let\u2019s wait until 4\u2026 Is the boy going to point and sign in pre school?  That sounds like a rough go of it.", "It doesn\u2019t take more than an afternoon of phone calls to arrange an assessment.  I sense foot dragging on her part.", "Maybe ask your pediatrician about selective mutism. It\u2019s something a friend dealt with her child.", "I got mine two years ago at 45. Getting proper help and followup treatment is a pain, but the diagnosis and meds are very likely to have an instant positive impact on your life. Best of luck on your journey!", "I\u2019m afab, was a \u201cgifted\u201d child, considered to be above and beyond my peers, one of those kids that was expected to become a doctor or lawyer (culturally as well, because I\u2019m half Asian) despite the fact I never studied. \n\nand then I completely burnt out in my last two years of high school, had a lot of trouble when I did try studying, and came to resent books (despite being a bookworm as a kid) because books meant studying (I still can\u2019t properly read books as an adult, and it breaks my heart). \n\nEveryone just telling me I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019m selfish, I\u2019m wasting all my potential, \u201cyou\u2019re so smart, why is it suddenly so hard for you?\u201d etc. \n\nHad to drop out my final year, they diagnosed me with depression/anxiety, years of therapy and medication never properly working, coasting in and out of uni, etc. \n\nHad been seeing memes and jokes about people finding out they have adhd and goin \u201chaha I do that\u201d and then my sister got diagnosed with autism thanks to her new psych picking up the signs. And then she brings up to me that I have a lot of ADHD traits (especially for women). I bring it up to my psychiatrist of 5-6 years, she said \u201cI never considered the possibility, but yeah, it makes sense, anyway, want to try the medication?\u201d. \n\nAnd well, turns out I do indeed have ADHD. \n\nThe pandemic didn\u2019t help certain matters, but I\u2019m definitely in a better place now then I was before, and I\u2019m actually feeling better and doing better as well. \n\nStill resent the fact no one picked up on the, now in hindsight, very obvious symptoms.", "Bella Hadid. And NOT because she apparently just played an autistic character on some show. I was just reading an interview with her saying she regretted she got a nose job. By a few sentences in I was like...hmmm. By the end, I was like, oh boy.", "Now we both never shut up. XD", "Yup. It helps stuttering people and induces stuttering in non-stuttering people. Non-stuttering people also find the experience very disorienting and find it very difficult to speak at all.", "She said elsewhere that the pediatrician told her to wait. HUGE error in judgement from the ped, in my opinion, and obviously not the mom\u2019s fault! But I hope she takes the feedback here to heart and gets an assessment scheduled. If intervention is needed, it\u2019s best to start as early as possible.", "I don't have any meds. Same to you.", "Definitely. In earlier shows, look how she keeps her eyes flickering. Yes, that. Her focus. Now she lightly keeps any of her limbs tapping. She sure is ND but not sure which one. May be ADHD since how neat she keeps her desk. Also, being a perfectionist.", "Oh that's weeeird! I had no clue.\nI mean it was disorienting and weird for me too, very hard to adjust to it. But I think the trick was if you speak slow enough the delay is gone. So I had to force myself to speak slow. Speaking while you hear the delay is basically impossible.", "Agree about her doc, odd opinion to wait on even a simple assessment.   As I posted down below, my son (now 8) was ten weeks Preemie and had his life changed by early intervention therapies."]}
