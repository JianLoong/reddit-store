She\u2019s asked my mom to come over to help set up her apartment, to teach her to cook something, to comfort her. She follows my mom around work too ( my mom told me about this one ). \n\nMy mom is the kindest person ever but she will literally do everything for a person and is kind of a doormat.\n\nMy mom\u2019s workplace had this outdoor picnic for its employees and family. We went and set up everything and then Jessica arrived and literally sat on our picnic blanket right next to my mom and didn\u2019t leave the entire time. She said she didn\u2019t have anyone to invite. At the end of it, I was fed up and when my mom left I told her to stop being clingy to my mom because Jessica wasn\u2019t her kid. She started crying which made me feel bad but then called me a selfish brat which is pure projection imo. My dad told her not to call me that and that she was intruding. Jessica eventually left. My mom came back and we had a nice time after that. \n\nApparently, Jessica told my mom a really skewed version of what happened at work and my mom is a little upset at all of us including Jessica because we were yelling.

My mother even fell out with relatives who offered the slightest criticism of this woman--and she made my adolescence a living hell. Of course, she eventually moved into our home. She went so far as calling my mother \"Mama.\" \n\nIn any case, you should get the movie, *Notes on a Scandal* with Judi Dench.

They are toxic clingy and they won't stop unless they seek professional help.

And it will only get worse.", "As someone who also has a doormat as a mother I feel you. My mum got taken advantage of so many times and it was awful to watch. My mum is an extremely emotionally sensitive person as well. \n\nNTA wholeheartedly. I do feel like your dad should actually have reasoned with your mum before it came to this, but maybe he did. I know you can't account for every detail in a post. \n\nThe main concern now is how your mum will move forward, will she coddle this coworker and let her right back into her personal life/space or will she keep these boundaries. I really hope she has learned and will keep the girl at arns length.", "ESH. Jessica sounds nuts. Your mom is TA for being so passive that you feel like you need to set her boundaries for her.

If you and your dad had a conversation with your mom about your concerns, fine.

Which she's doing to you, by trying to make it seem like you were being a \"brat\". Your mom should be very worried about this escalation. \n\nAnd see it for what it is. It's an abusive manipulation tactic to get their victim all to themselves. \n\nThe fact that she's also trying to wear your mom down whenever she doesn't go along with her desired amount of contact (by spamming very disturbing stuff of her crying like your mom has hurt her by not responding) is VERY concerning.

A quiet intervention may be the best way to go, try and encourage your Mum to speak to HR. By the sound of things they shouldn't work together, but it would be unfair to ask your Mum to leave her job.\n\nI don't think a talking to by HR would put Jessica off, so if they want her to keep her job they shouldn't schedule her and your Mum on the same shift. Just to be clear, Jessica should be the one to change shifts, your Mum has done nothing wrong besides being a little too caring. Jessica might even do more work if she isn't following your Mum around!\n\nA gentle intervention with Mum, a trip to HR, and some call screening on her phone would be a good place to start.

I had a coworker that became one of my best friends about ten years ago. She basically was like the mom I needed and never had. However, I didn\u2019t overstep and knew she had a family. I am older than her kids by almost ten years and they are boys. I used to hang out with them at their house and played video games or watch tv. I sometimes took them out to eat just us and we always had the best time. They were happy their mom had a cool friend \ud83d\ude05 I miss those days because they\u2019re older now and have their own lives lol \nI\u2019m fairly shy, so it took me awhile to warm up to my friend and her family. Eventually, her own family welcomed me as a part of their own and I love them all. The difference is I\u2019m not clingy lol back when we lived near each other, we spent a lot of time together mainly because I took her to and from work after her car broke down. We went thrift shopping a lot and ate at random places around town often. \nNow that she has moved, sometimes we talk a lot for a few days, and at times we go days without talking. When we do talk again, it\u2019s like we just got off the phone a few hours before and no time has passed. I also had a few other friends who I talked to and hung out with, so it wasn\u2019t like I only hung out with the same person. I still led my own life. I was just busy, which is great for a person like me. There\u2019s a thing called a boundary and Jessica crossed that. It\u2019s okay to be emotional and have a friend there to help you. It\u2019s different when you\u2019re obsessed and you have no life outside one particular person. Wow, didn\u2019t mean for this to be a story. Whoops lol", "YTA\n\nYour mom is her own person.

You literally said of her work, \"She likes it a lot.\" You started a yelling match at your mothers work picnic. Nice going.

OP also said she received 29 text and voice messages from Jessica in the span of 20 minutes. Why lie to OP\u2019s mom about the argument when OP\u2019s dad was there to back up OP?
