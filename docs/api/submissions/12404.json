It is the little things that they said here and there that my irritation/annoyance accumulated throughout the years and turned to an anxiety. Okay what they gonna say this time, do they meant it, or were they just joking. I would voiced out my concerns to my husband and he always say they were just kidding don't take it seriously. So there were times that I get so much anxiety and depressed after we go up that I had to schedule a therapy session after. My therapist suggested to distance myself  and talk to my husband. So I talked to my husband about my feelings of being uncomfortable and anxiety around his family. I already blocked them on social media and I blocked their numbers too. So my anxiety only kick in once we pulled over his dad/sister's driveway.\n\nAnyways although, my husband was not thrilled about it and thinks I am just super sensitive to his family's comments. He said okay to just a civil relationship. He goes to the family events by himself and if we have a get together at house his family are always welcome and invited but they never come over though. They are hurt by my actions with what I did. For the record my husband always visit his family and it was never the issue between him and I. I just do not want to be around his family.   \n\nThis might be the part where I am an asshole... the blocking and not going has been a year and a half. The family thinks that I should be over for whatever happened by now. They don't think to this date that what they said were wrong. I still have a reservations and I feel that I like the peace so much that I don't want to go back that state of mind anymore. \n\nMy husband open up that he feels that there is always an elephant in the room every time he goes hang out with his family. Since my husband's family do not really have a deep conversation and they are used to shoving everything down the rug. He thinks that my family are still hurt by my action. I told him well that's him and his family's problem. NOT MINE. So he feels that I don't understand him and his situation. IDK what say.

If they want any type of relationship they should apologize and change behavior.", "NTA. They think you should be over it, but what amends have they endeavored to make? What real progress have they made towards changing their behavior? If there are not satisfactory answers to those questions, end of conversation. (Please note that even if there are satisfactory answers, you aren't required to 'get over it' on anyone else's timetable!) \n\nYour husband should be alarmed that his family's behavior is so bad you required therapy.

Maybe - if they apologized. \n\nI mean, I've said some stupid stuff over the years, but I apologize and ask that they let me know if I say stuff that crosses the line. \n\nIf you need freakin' therapy after visiting them, I'd say their comments aren't just \"little things\". \n\nI don't get why your husband doesn't stand up for you though.  He could tell his family to stop making those omments and treat you like a part of the family, so until he does that, I suppose that elephant will always be in the room when he goes there.", "Info: did you ever tell his family what they did that hurt you?", "NTA. They\u2019re pretty much dismissing your feelings and telling you to get over with without so much as an apology or even admitting to any type of responsibility. And btw, I fully believe that jokes have a slight amount of truth in them. So whatever they were joking about, even if they didn\u2019t fully mean it, they thought about it at some point.", "NTA. This has clearly had an impact on your mental health to the point you had to seek therapy. Your partner needs to stop with the \u201cyou are just being sensitive\u201d bullshit and actually listen to how these comments hurt you. Just because they wouldn\u2019t hurt him doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t have been effected by them. \nNo one wants or deserves toxicity in their lives. Have they ever apologised for this said thing that they said/did? Before suggesting you should get over it and unblock them?", "NTA\n\nThey don't get to dictate when you should be over \"it.\" That's a real AH move.  Especially with the non-apology. You haven't stopped your husband from seeing them or inviting them to your house. For the record, civil relationships go both ways, and it's not just you swallowing whatever they dish out. They needed to try too.\n\nI can empathize with your husband being in a tough spot, but he put himself there. They're his family and he should've put a stop to it. If they care from him, they should've heard him out.\n\nThere's a part of me that wanted to say E S H because you needed to say \"that's not funny,\" or flat out ask if they're trying to be mean or funny, because you're an adult who doesn't have to be subjected to their BS. But not everyone has learned that, and you're in therapy which will hopefully get you to that point. Your husband \"thinks\" there's and elephant in the room, but never addresses it, which make you 100% right that the problem is with him and his family. \n\nRemoving yourself for now was totally the right thing to do.", "NTA. There could have been a way to solve this. If they apologized to you and stopped saying those things that hurt you. And as for your husband, he could have stopped minimizing your feelings and also stood up for you. So, it\u2019s all the consequences of their actions, really. Let them have that elephant in the room. They created it.", "This would be good to talk over with your therapist about.", "NTA \n\nBut I almost voted ESH and I'll tell you why. \n\nPeople often don't realize how their words hurt, especially if your husband and his family have had that dynamic from the beginning. You're a newcomer in a way and they've gotten so comfortable dissing everyone as a \"joke\" and have forgotten how it sounds to someone who's not on board with it. I wouldn't be on board with it, either, btw. \n\nThis isn't going to be easy but you need to address it with them in person. Tell them how you feel. Some block heads don't know until you confront them about their behavior!If they can't accept it and refuse to change and apologize, then by all means, stay away. You will know that you tried. To just block them and stay away never solves anything. And what if you have children with your husband? \n\nYour husband is failing you. He has chosen to side with his family over you and your real feelings of hurt. That speaks volumes! Marriage counseling is highly recommended here.

It doesnt sound like they're joking", "Yta - you don't have to go (and I don't blame you for not) but you could also be a little empathetic towards him being in an uncomfortable spot.", "ESH.  In a marriage that lasts and is full of love you share and support each other.  And you share the good as well as the bad.  In this case you get to share his family and support him because it is a part of who he is.  Your husband is an AH because he should have had your back and realized he wasn\u2019t supporting you. You also are an AH because no where in your narrative did you say you had tried talking about your feelings with his family. And you have also decided to de facto cut them out of your life, at the expense of your husband\u2019s feelings and emotional well being.  His family is n AH because they are clearly clueless and mean.  The fact that you \u2018should be over it\u2019 suggests that they think there was a single incident rather than a series of belittling mean comments.  And all of this could have been mitigated if not avoided if you had just discussed it with your husband to make sure he was going to support you and then both of you united when you discussed it with his family where you stated clear expectations and consequences for failing those expectations.", ">I don't get why your husband doesn't stand up for you though.\n\nFrom what OP has said, it sounds he doesn't get it much better than his family does.\n\nThat the rest of them are pulling a 2nd rate Urkel imitation and going \"Did I do that?\". They know OP is unhappy with them but they can't ID why.\n\nWhere the husband knows what it is and that OP is upset, but is so used to it that he's just blows it off and doesn't see it as worth being upset about. Hence the \"don't take them seriously\" attitude.\n\n>He could tell his family to stop making those omments and treat you like a part of the family,\n\nOP doesn't say exactly what his family says, but I get the impression that they are treatimg her like part of the family. Its just that they say things that tear people down to each other constantly, and expect that people will ignore it. Which is why husband says she should.\n\nAnd thats the problem. Its not a family dynamic that she wants to be a part of.\n\nDoes the husband need to stand up for OP? Yes.\n\nDoes he actually need to get why she can't just ignore their rude comments to do so? No.\n\nHe just needs to accept that she considers them rude and that it is behavior that she won't tolerate. If he accepted that, he might have stood up for her already.", "Agree. Not everyone has the same sense of humour. It's hard when someone's light hearted affectionate ribbing is then taken as horrendously offensive. Now I don't mean actual bullying but when everyone takes the piss a bit and someone doesn't get it, it's an issue.", "OP is NTA for distancing protecting herself from the cruelty of the inlaws. Her husband wants to be a better victim so his family can push her over again. She's not doing anything wrong by refusing to be abused and he needs to pick a side.", "I would say yes if her husband was empathetic towards her feelings about his family comments. However he brushed it off.", "Info: through ANY of this, did you ever tell them to stop? Your therapist never mentioned once to call them out on it? That could be their family dynamic; sarcasm and little digs at each other.", "It's also time her husband understands that too... He doesn't want to hold anyone accountable for anything and wants her to just suck it up. Nope!", "Hold on - we have no examples of anything the family have said. \n\nWe do know OP deals with disliking in laws by taking incendiary action. Blocking them openly of course will lead to a response and reaction. If it was just to avoid them, then make polite excuses, don't look at their profiles, don't answer the phone. \n\nAlso therapy needed after seeing them, because they \"push her buttons\"? This sounds incredibly over dramatic.\n\nIt sounds to me as if OP is part of the problem here. If not all of it.", "YTA\n\nBlocking them and deleting them is not subtle and causes more problems. You don't have to enjoy spending time with inlays but you do have to make an effort to get along with them for your partner and out of respect.
