They\u2019re just silly. Mine to her are a little bigger just because she loves it so much. Like once I found out how to change the background on her car screen and took a picture of my butt and put it on there. She laughed about it for hours. I changed it back.\n\nAbout 2 years ago when she was having a giggle fit, she told me her idea for a \u201cbig\u201d prank. To switch someone\u2019s deodorant stick with cream cheese. She laughed so hard about it that she cried. She said she could never do that but how funny would it be?\n\nWell, I saved it in my back pocket. It had to line up with her needing a new stick of deodorant and me being able to do it without her noticing. So yeah, two years later, I finally got things going. \n\nUnfortunately\u2026 her sister came to stay with us. They use the same deodorant, and her sister mistook the cream cheese one for hers.

I understand why your SIL is upset, but she is the one who used your wife\u2019s deodorant. It\u2019s not predictable to think someone else may use it. The intended and likely victim, your wife, thought it was funny.", "LOL nah NTA. Honest mistake", "NTA. Her sister can't even smell the differences between deodorant and cream cheese? Its unfortunate. But, not something you could have anticipated.\n\nRather sucks for her. Its not like you already knew they share stick deodorant? My sisters and I don't.

And it sounds like you have a great relationship with your wife. Don't stop the pranks. Inform your SIL that you will continue so she needs to question everything while in your house. Her paranoia would be part of the fun whether or not you pull anything while she is there. \n\nPlease explain how your SIL can't tell the difference between cream cheese and deodorant.

It was odd that you chose _that exact_ time to do this prank. \n\nThe other question is how long was the cream cheese in there? More than 5-6 hours at room temp and it would start getting funky.
