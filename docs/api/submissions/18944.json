All names are fake.\n\nI(52f) have 4 kids my oldest daughter Carol (34), Kelly (25f), Lucy (24f) and Mark (21m). Since Carol was born I have stayed at home looking after the kids while my husband Derek (53) provided for the family. I wanted to see my children grow and be there for them for everything they might need.\n\nDue to the age gap between my oldest and my youngest kids, Carol and the rest were never close to each other. I let Carol to concentrate on her hobbies and school and looked after the youngest myself even my husband insisted to get Carol to babysit and help with them. Later when the youngest were getting older I encouraged them to choose the hobbies and careers they were interested in and we helped them to go to uni and fully paid for their education.\n\nA few years ago Kelly came out to me as being polyamorous, it is something Lucy and Mark knew since Kelly was in college, but she wanted me know too. It is a lot to take in as Derek and I both come from very traditional families, but I did my best to support my daughter and learn more about my daughter's orientation. We have also discussed about her coming out to her father, but my husband would never understand it and he previously said he finds the entire concept of poly disgusting when we tried to talk to him. \n\nNow Carol is getting married to a large very traditional family too (her own choice) and is planning to take over some of her in laws business and help with it. Her fiance family is paying for the wedding and they have over 1000 guests invited, including a lot of business partners and work colleagues. As a result each of my kids also received an invitation for a plus one to bring to the wedding. And it didn't sit well with Kelly.\n\nKelly wants to bring several of her partners to the wedding as they are all very important to her and essentially come out as poly at her sister's wedding. I have told her she can't do that, if she wants to come out she can but not during her sister special day and since her sister is not aware about Kelly being poly, she should discuss with her if it is ok to bring several partners.\n\nKelly was not happy with that and called me an asshole for playing favourites when I'm just trying to look after all my children. Lucy and Mark agree with Kelly and believe I should stop intervening and let Kelly do what she feels is right, but I don't want this to cause a rift between my children.

This day isn't about her.\n\nHer insistence on it has me leaning toward her either being annoyed someone else has the attention, or given its a wedding to another \"traditional\" family her coming out during it is basically a form of protest.\n\nAsk yourself why the other kids are on Kelly's side, and ensure that if they choose to be selfish the ramifications will be swift.", "You said she is \"polygamous,\" but I believe you mean \"polyamorous,\" which is a different thing.

It may not be fair to think that you have the final word on it, but it is appropriate to let Kelly know that she needs to speak to Carol and that Carol\u2019s wedding is absolutely not the place to come out as poly.\n\nIf she chooses not to have an appropriate conversation with her sister beforehand, then she can follow the invitation and bring a plus one. Regardless of how many people are coming or how well off Carol\u2019s future family may be, Kelly still does not get to decide that her multiple lovers are worth the extra expense for Carol and her in-laws.", "NTA - You\u2019re a good mom and this is the right choice.  No one is against Kelly. She can bring one person just like everyone else.", "NTA. Thank Mark for suggesting that you post here, and show this to all three younger kids.

That's her choice, whatever.   \n\nBut, this is just not something to announce at a wedding: it's no different from announcing your own engagement, or your pregnancy, or any other \"big\" news at someone else's special day.  It's just plain \"look at meeeeee!\" thinking, and it's rude.  Maybe Kelly could wear white, too, just as a cherry on top.\n\nAs for the +1, well, yeah, it's rough when your romantic relationship is more than 2 people. Most gatherings will be \"you +1\" invites.  That's the norm in our society.  Considering each \"+1\" is an extra cost to the host, it's only fair to discuss it with the host when you want to bring more people, on their dime.", "NTA.  Kelly is in her \"in your face mode regarding her sexuality\".  You are correct.

She has no right to hijack her sister's wedding by making a personal announcement for herself. Besides, having multiple partners is nothing to be proud of nor does it need a special announcement.", "A wedding isn't the place to come out about anything.

If I was the sister getting married and your daughter did that, I would lose it on her and not speak with her anymore. Do not announce anything on anyone\u2019s wedding. Simple as that.  It is not about her. And to bring several partners????? Either your daughter comes and support her sister or stay her behind home with her partners.", "NTA. If she wants to come out as poly she can do it on a separate occasion. A plus one is customary but not necessarily guaranteed to all weddings, and a \"plus x\" is not heard of. Her options should be that she can either pick one partner and go, not go at all, or talk to her sister prior to the wedding about some other accommodation and accept her sisters decision.", "NTA. I'm poly myself, have no issue with it, would love to bring multiple partners to a wedding (when I eventually get more, lmao) but know that it would ONLY be appropriate to do so if everyone attending would 100% definitely be chill about it and knew in advance, and that is definitely not the case here. It's not a question of the polyamory itself or of playing favorites, it's just that a wedding is an important occasion and you should never do anything at one that will leave a bigger impression on the guests than the wedding itself.", "Kelly could negatively impact Carol's livelihood since there will be many businesses contacts there.

Kelly is within her own right to come out, but needs to do so when it isn\u2019t Carols wedding. This reeks of self entitlement to me. It has nothing to do with her orientation, and everything to do with sisters supporting sisters on both sides.

If Kelly wanted to bring a same-gender partner, would that be a problem? Or a partner of a different race? In the past these are the same arguments used to closet and persecute atypical relationships. So I question the motive, because I don't believe \"keeping the peace\" to be an adequate reason and I wonder if this is a way to exert control. I certainly can understand why Kelly would feel that way. If Kelly were to only bring one partner but talk about her other partners in casual conversation, would that be acceptable? If not, I think the motivation is questionable.", "NTA. It's a +1 which means you get to bring 1 guest. This isn't about lifestyle, and her sister's wedding is not Kelly's coming out opportunity.\n\nKelly is not special for having multiple partners.

She needs to get over herself, she's a guest at this wedding, this is not her big moment.", "NTA, she gets a plus one, like everyone else, and if she wants more she needs to discuss this herself with Carol. If she thinks it would be unfair on her partners, she can always bring none of them. In my country's culture it would be weird to bring even one plus one if the wedding couple don't already know and approve of that person. I don't think it's necessary for Kelly to bring a plus one, especially since she'll already know a lot of people to talk to at the wedding. \n\nAlso she would be the asshole if she came out at Carol's wedding. It's the same as someone proposing or announcing a pregnancy at someone else's wedding- it's not Kelly's day. If she wants to come out, maybe you can help her arrange a family gathering a while before the wedding, and she can bring her partners to that and come out there?", "NTA. How many partners is Kelly expecting to bring?

No extra food and is just plain rude to invite others to an event hosted by someone else.", "Oh please it\u2019s +1 not +10.\nWe all know major not wedding related things should be shared at wedding.

To me this makes Kelly the only A H here.", "You shouldn\u2019t support her decision to use her sister\u2019s wedding as a coming out party.", "What's that got to do with Kelly wanting her +1 to be + several? Kelly wants to bring more people, she needs to talk to the person hosting the event and issuing invitations.", "Soft NTA, but this is really a conversation that needs to happen between sisters. All you can do is advise, but you cannot forbid if it is not your wedding and if you are not paying.", "She must have edited it - I read it three times to be sure she had the word polygamist. I don\u2019t know enough about either to know if there is a different so I used the word OP used."]}
