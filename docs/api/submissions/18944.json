All names are fake.\n\nI(52f) have 4 kids my oldest daughter Carol (34), Kelly (25f), Lucy (24f) and Mark (21m). Since Carol was born I have stayed at home looking after the kids while my husband Derek (53) provided for the family. I wanted to see my children grow and be there for them for everything they might need.\n\nDue to the age gap between my oldest and my youngest kids, Carol and the rest were never close to each other. I let Carol to concentrate on her hobbies and school and looked after the youngest myself even my husband insisted to get Carol to babysit and help with them. Later when the youngest were getting older I encouraged them to choose the hobbies and careers they were interested in and we helped them to go to uni and fully paid for their education.\n\nA few years ago Kelly came out to me as being polyamorous, it is something Lucy and Mark knew since Kelly was in college, but she wanted me know too. It is a lot to take in as Derek and I both come from very traditional families, but I did my best to support my daughter and learn more about my daughter's orientation. We have also discussed about her coming out to her father, but my husband would never understand it and he previously said he finds the entire concept of poly disgusting when we tried to talk to him. \n\nNow Carol is getting married to a large very traditional family too (her own choice) and is planning to take over some of her in laws business and help with it. Her fiance family is paying for the wedding and they have over 1000 guests invited, including a lot of business partners and work colleagues. As a result each of my kids also received an invitation for a plus one to bring to the wedding. And it didn't sit well with Kelly.\n\nKelly wants to bring several of her partners to the wedding as they are all very important to her and essentially come out as poly at her sister's wedding. I have told her she can't do that, if she wants to come out she can but not during her sister special day and since her sister is not aware about Kelly being poly, she should discuss with her if it is ok to bring several partners.\n\nKelly was not happy with that and called me an asshole for playing favourites when I'm just trying to look after all my children. Lucy and Mark agree with Kelly and believe I should stop intervening and let Kelly do what she feels is right, but I don't want this to cause a rift between my children. AITA?\n\nEdit: I was advised to add this to the post. Kelly has a primary partner of 4 years who she has been bringing to all the family events, there was a time when he was out of town and Kelly wanted to bring a different partner, but I had to explain unless she comes out before that and explains what being poly is, it will make the entire family feel very awkward the next time she brings her primary partner around. From what I have heard she also brings her primary partner to work related events, hence why I don't really see why she feels the need to bring several partners to the wedding when it wasn't the case before.", "created_utc": 1685892106, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140g849/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_cant_bring_her/", "score": 2578, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Regardless of how many people are coming or how well off Carol\u2019s future family may be, Kelly still does not get to decide that her multiple lovers are worth the extra expense for Carol and her in-laws.", "NTA - You\u2019re a good mom and this is the right choice.

Maybe Kelly could wear white, too, just as a cherry on top.\n\nAs for the +1, well, yeah, it's rough when your romantic relationship is more than 2 people. Most gatherings will be \"you +1\" invites.  That's the norm in our society.  Considering each \"+1\" is an extra cost to the host, it's only fair to discuss it with the host when you want to bring more people, on their dime.", "NTA.  Kelly is in her \"in your face mode regarding her sexuality\".  You are correct.

If I was the sister getting married and your daughter did that, I would lose it on her and not speak with her anymore. Do not announce anything on anyone\u2019s wedding. Simple as that.  It is not about her. And to bring several partners????? Either your daughter comes and support her sister or stay her behind home with her partners.", "NTA. If she wants to come out as poly she can do it on a separate occasion. A plus one is customary but not necessarily guaranteed to all weddings, and a \"plus x\" is not heard of.

I'm poly myself, have no issue with it, would love to bring multiple partners to a wedding (when I eventually get more, lmao) but know that it would ONLY be appropriate to do so if everyone attending would 100% definitely be chill about it and knew in advance, and that is definitely not the case here. It's not a question of the polyamory itself or of playing favorites, it's just that a wedding is an important occasion and you should never do anything at one that will leave a bigger impression on the guests than the wedding itself.", "Kelly could negatively impact Carol's livelihood since there will be many businesses contacts there.

Kelly is within her own right to come out, but needs to do so when it isn\u2019t Carols wedding. This reeks of self entitlement to me. It has nothing to do with her orientation, and everything to do with sisters supporting sisters on both sides.

If Kelly wanted to bring a same-gender partner, would that be a problem? Or a partner of a different race? In the past these are the same arguments used to closet and persecute atypical relationships. So I question the motive, because I don't believe \"keeping the peace\" to be an adequate reason and I wonder if this is a way to exert control. I certainly can understand why Kelly would feel that way. If Kelly were to only bring one partner but talk about her other partners in casual conversation, would that be acceptable? If not, I think the motivation is questionable.", "NTA. It's a +1 which means you get to bring 1 guest. This isn't about lifestyle, and her sister's wedding is not Kelly's coming out opportunity.\n\nKelly is not special for having multiple partners. It's not like other guests are allowed to invite their entire friend groups along.

If she thinks it would be unfair on her partners, she can always bring none of them. In my country's culture it would be weird to bring even one plus one if the wedding couple don't already know and approve of that person. I don't think it's necessary for Kelly to bring a plus one, especially since she'll already know a lot of people to talk to at the wedding. \n\nAlso she would be the asshole if she came out at Carol's wedding. It's the same as someone proposing or announcing a pregnancy at someone else's wedding- it's not Kelly's day. If she wants to come out, maybe you can help her arrange a family gathering a while before the wedding, and she can bring her partners to that and come out there?", "NTA.

No extra food and is just plain rude to invite others to an event hosted by someone else.", "Oh please it\u2019s +1 not +10.\nWe all know major not wedding related things should be shared at wedding.

Unless her sister is ok with it, it is also inappropriate for her to bring more than the one guest she has been allotted for this event, and kinda inappropriate to even ask.", "I definitely don't think you're being reasonable. It might be worth asking Kelly if there is something else going on that is making her wishing to use carol's wedding to come out. Is she treating it as an opportunity to protest? Is she wanting to do it as an f'you to any of those who would be against her poly situation? If this is the case then there is a different conversation to be had", "I think that info should be added to the post if you can as it gives a clearer picture of what Kelly's intentions are (as it seems some commenters given y t a and e s h verdicts aren't understanding).

Then she can still choose 1 plus one to bring to her sister\u2019s wedding (asking for multiple guests is unfair if only from a financial point of view). \n\nAlternatively could you have a gathering a month or so after the wedding so Kelly can introduce her partners to her family.", ">When she came out to me she was wondering if she can take a different partner to one of the family events as her primary partner was away on a work trip, but I had to tell her unless she comes out to everyone it will make things really awkward when her primary partner returns and she will bring him to the next family event.\n\nNow see, I think this is kind of shitty. This wasn't her sister's wedding or something similarly important, I presume? Bringing one of her other partners would've been a great way to announce to the family that she is poly. Telling her not to do that because it will make it awkward is an AH move. You phrase is as though it would be awkward for her partner, but it would really be awkward for you and your family because you're clearly not totally down with this situation - and that is fair because you're traditional and this is radical, but your excuse of \"awkward\" is bullshit. \n\nIf Kelly is poly, that means she LOVES her partners. They are IMPORTANT to her. She wants her family to understand and she doesn't want to hide.

I speak from experience nonetheless.", "While she may be in the wrong for wanting more people, it is not for you to decide. You are simply a third party to this.

Carol and Kelly are adults who should be managing their own relationships without mommy playing middleman.", "Regardless of whether Kelly wants to come out to her sister before the wedding Carol needs to know because it's very likely that Kelly will make a big deal about it at the wedding because she's upset she didn't get to bring other partners. Carol needs to know so she can make a good decision for herself about withdrawing Kelly's invitation to the wedding full stop in order to avoid all the unnecessary drama.", "While that's ideal, if Kelly isn't ready to come out, being forced to would make her cagey and could result in lashing out.

As a side note, if I were dad and got to find out something this important about my daughter in a room full of 1000 semi-acquaintances I would be pretty hurt.", "This is also a very valid point.

It's fairly unanimous that you're NTA and that Kelly is TA.", "Agreed and believe me. Kelly knows exactly what she is doing. WTH does she need to bring that many people? Choose one and move on or don\u2019t go.", "But also a wedding is to bring your loved ones and celebrate with them, and if their relationship isn't hierarchical, choosing one partner over the other can be messy. Usually in this situation I've seen people offer to pay for the extra +1 so they aren't a bigger burden on the bride + groom, and I think that's a good compromise. The only real issue after that is people potentially making it a big deal that someone has multiple partners and turning it into an event about them without them trying to, but there's only so much you can do there.", "Agreed", "NTA. You are in no way playing favorites. Kelly is trying to make Carol wedding about her coming out as poly. That is a selfish thing to do.", "Did OP say how many partners Kelly has? Because in the post she mention several. I understand poly is a lifestyle but NTA OP, this screams attention seeker. Why would she not set a date before or after thhe wedding?

A wedding is in no way a place for you to come out to 1000s of people as poly -many of which don't know you, many of which are not close, many of which are not associated with you- and it will turn someone else's day into YOUR day, and it'll sting and hurt in the long run \n\nI absolutely agree with the \"do your own Come Out Party\" for the announcement\nA wedding that is not about you has to stay focused on the union between the bride and groom, and their now new family link in each other's family tree\n\nThe entitlement of one: involving your other sibling in this because \"I want reassurance that I'm not the bad girl here\"; two: believing you're above everyone by asking for more \"plus ones\" is inappropriate and inconsiderate for the others -as well as tacky imo- and three: calling your mom an AH for telling you \"You'll have a day in the spotlight, but your sister's wedding is not it. Either do it before, but not in front of a traditional wedding\" and then having the audacity to say she's playing favorites over a planned event that is not about her being about her is just immature \n\nTL;DR: Can't take more than one plus one?

It\u2019s one thing if she privately wants her IMMEDIATE family to know. If she wants the WHOLE family to know, then she can organize her own coming out party and let the chips fall where they may.

There is no universe in which showing up to a major event and announcing you're poly is going to get a better reaction than telling people beforehand; that tactic has nothing to do with being open and authentic. I think Kelly really likes the idea of being dramatic and disruptive. I wonder if there's any kind of resentment or rivalry between the sisters.

They may not all be s3xual relationships, but there is almost always a degree of relationship between them.  There is also usually an agreement of \"veto\" whereby one or more partners may not want an individual to become, or remain within the polycule, and the person who brought them in then must decide to end that relationship, or have them as a separate partnership,  if that is part of the agreement within their grouping.", "Polygamy is multiple women to one man.
