Symptoms are more subtle and can appear anywhere from 1 hour to 3 weeks after eating the allergen.\n\nFood Intolerance: Not an allergy because there's no immune response, so no antibodies are produced.

The difference between the two is what causes the reaction (an allergy is due to the immune system, an intolerance has to do with chemistry in the bowel/blood I think), not how severe the symptoms can be.
