My home life was a was abusive, weighing over 300lbs, depressed, shy, and always with my head down alone with over sized jackets to hide. Had glasses, bad skin, and long hair.\n\nLora NEVER called me by my name. I don't think she even knew it. ALways called me bad names or nicknames. Even after being in the same grade since middle school. She was super popular and athletic. She would always torment me and sometimes physically. She would suck up to the teachers and always got away with it.\n\nI moved out on my 18th birthday. I left town and cut off everyone from my old life. I got professional help through College and started getting healthy. This helped my skin to clear up, got Lasik to get rid of glasses my sense of style. People call it a \"glow up.\" I changed the way I looked, acted and carried myself. I now have my own place and a successful career.\n\nI told her that I started at the school a couple of months before the end of the school year. She seemed to accept it. Our graduating class was almost 500.\n\nThroughout the night we kept talking and having good conversations. I danced around most of her questions and kept things vague. I was surprised with how she seemed to have changed since high school.\n\nShe told me that after high school she went to collage. Got married and divorced went through a hard time for a while. But is a different person.\n\nAs the night was coming to close she made a comment to one of her old friends about how she wished [my old nickname] was here so she could apologize and try to make up for how horrible she acted. She didnt remember my real name. One of her friends must have seen me make a face at the name and start to walk away. She walked after me yelling at me to stop. I walked out to my ride and started to leave. She caught up to me before I could escape.

Until she nodded\u00a0 then slowly asked \"[my real name] is that you?\"\n\nI said I have no idea who that is and turned around to slowly leave the area.\n\nSomeone got my number and passed it around.

I didn't respond to any of the messages.\n\nLora sent a long text and said she was upset that I didnt tell her the truth and that she had wanted to apologize fot the way she treated me throughout high school.

Here\u2019s my advice to you. You are a strong person. I\u2019m amazed that you went to the reunion. It\u2019s only been 10 years, and I really admire the direction you have taken with your life. \n\nRespond to her, but carefully. Example: \u201cJust because you\u2019re wanting to apologize to ease your own conscience, doesn\u2019t mean I have to relive or address the past on your timeline. I am not ready to hear you.

That's not an apology.", "NTA-You didn\u2019t owe her your real name or the information that you were her victim.", ">As the night was coming to close she made a comment to one of her old friends about how she wished [my old nickname] was here so she could apologize and try to make up for how horrible she acted.\n\nOMG this woman has yhe audacity to say she changed but coube bothered to learn or remember the name of the person she bullied and wanted to apologize to? And now her friends are giving you a hard time? None of them has changed! NTA maybe by the 20th yr reunion this group will have found some maturity", "NTA. Their apologetic intent sure seems flimsy if you're the AH for not disclosing your name", "NTA she's making this about her.  If you want to you can explain how much she hurt you but you don't owe her diddly.", "NTA, it's clear that she's looking for forgiveness to absolve her own guilt but you don't owe her that. I'm happy that you've come so far and hopefully she stops trying to drag you into the past.", "NTA. She\u2019s the same person. It was all about her when she bullied you, it\u2019s all about her apologizing. Keep your head up and skip the future reunions!", "NTA.  You don't owe your bullies anything.  That includes time, any extra consideration beyond basic politeness, and forgiveness.", "NTA. It seems you don't need nor want her apology. Just like others have said she's only doing it for herself.", "Of course you're NTA. For someone who wanted to apologize for being such an A-H, Lora sure reverted right back to her high school attitude. Since she was aware of how mean she was to you, she should have also been aware of why you did not want to tell her who you were when she first confronted you.", "NTA. The only reason she wants to apologize is to make herself feel better. Same old sob story told by countless people who want to believe they\u2019re better people than they actually are. It\u2019s insincere and phony and you\u2019re better off leaving her to wallow in her own unresolved story.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t owe her a single thing after the way she treated you. Her apology sure doesn\u2019t seem very genuine if she can\u2019t even realize how her past actions made you uncomfortable to disclose who you were.", "So they bullied you a second time around also?! Jesus NTA. You don\u2019t owe those people anything.", "NTA. In AA one of the twelve steps \\[step 8?\\] is asking forgiveness from the people the alcoholic has harmed. this does not mean that the person who was harmed must forgive. She was a terrible bully to you. You have no responsibility to make her feel better about her past behavior.", "NTA, but...\n\nSerious question, but why did you go to your high school reunion? If high school life was as miserable as you say, what would be the point in socializing with your former classmates/bullies if you weren't looking for some sort of comeuppance moment like the one you had? \n\nYou're not an AH, but I'm just trying to figure out if you were irritated by the event or if you got exactly what you were looking for.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe any of them anything. Not even your real name.", "NTA. If she were actually sorry for how she treated you, she would have *texted you an apology for how she treated you*, and maybe a second apology for not recognizing you/potentially making you uncomfortable at the reunion.\n\nBut she's still the same self-absorbed AH she was 10 years ago, she's just experienced a little hardship and mistaken stress for growth. A good person would want to make amends. Instead, she wants to be forgiven/have a redemption story she can brag about at book club. Her past treatment of you doesn't mesh with her self-image as \"a good person\" - but making this all about her hurt feelings isn't the behavior of \"a good person\" either. She's still lashing out at you for her own gratification.\n\nBlock her, or expose her, but don't engage with her. Congrats on getting your life together, don't let her drag you back down.", "Food for thought. How come OP can say they changed so much, got help, and created a new life for themselves, but everyone thinks the bully has not changed in 10 years? She might genuinely feel bad for what she has done once she got older. OP does not need to accept the apology, but I wish more people understood that people change.\n\nNAH", "NAH, between the two of you, at least.", "I don\u2019t want to call you TAH because I can understand why you did it, but I can also see how it comes off. I\u2019m going to say NAH and take her up on the talk. Try to actually be open to it, cause it might give you some closure on the past and help both of you move forward as better people.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I hate to be that A H but if she was truly sorry wouldn't she at least know your name?", "Multiple people are harassing you for not identifying yourself to them as the person they bullied years ago? Why? You don\u2019t owe these people a thing. NTA.", "NTA\nThey're looking for absolution for what they inflicted on you. You do not owe them that, or anything else.. Yes, it's possible she's changed, but that doesn't mean you owe her any forgiveness--it's still her burden to carry, not yours.", "NAH in the present day although she was certainly TA in high school.  But people grow up.  You're no longer in high school and have a good life for yourself.  Don't let the teenage stupidity of others affect your confidence today.  Lora obviously knew she was TA and was looking to make it right.  Be magnanimous.  Contact her so she can say what she needs to say.  Since she knew she was TA back then, she also knew how hurtful her actions were.  Be honest and tell her how you felt back then and that was why you were wary at the reunion.", "I think that\u2019s the perfect response. The only additional thing I\u2019d add is that I don\u2019t want her to contact me again", "This 100%. She hasn't changed a bit.", "You don't even owe them basic politeness. They weren't polite - there's no reason for you to be.", "Part of the reason I went was by recommendation of my therapist. She said sometimes you have to face the past to see the future. Or something that that effect.  I was not going to see my family and I thought the reunion would be the next best option  and she agreed. \nI don't know what I was looking for when I went. I thought I would be like I was back in high school. The guy no one notice in the corner.  But it wasn't that way at all. But when I heard her use my old nickname something deep down shifted and I panicked.", "Is that you, Lora?", "Bullies are phony, by definition. And if they really do change then they understand that they are not owed forgiveness, at all, and they understand that they did a lot of lifelong damage that will never be okay. They certainly don\u2019t get upset that their picture perfect apology didn\u2019t go the way they planned it. Maybe some bullies change. This one is as sincere as a phishing scam.", "Don\u2019t do this. She\u2019s just looking for absolution. Don\u2019t give it to her.", "I kinda left that off intentionally. OP may decide one day that he wants to settle things. Only time will tell. This statement puts the ball in OP\u2019s court, so HE can decide if he ever wants to address it. Lora only has two options. 1) cease contact to prove that she now respects OP and is genuinely sorry, or 2) continues to contact which shows that she\u2019s still a selfcentered bully. \n\nEither way, OP gets the answer AND the control.", "Bullies are hurtful, by definition. Not phony. I am not justifying what the bully did was right, it is most definitely wrong on multiple different levels. I would do anything for a world without them. The bully had the intentions of apologizing to her and trying to show (hopefully) genuine remorse. Again, OP in no way, shape, or form needs to accept the apology. That is up for them to decide. I just can't fault someone for getting the courage to apologize or seek out an individual to apologize. \n\nBut we can agree to disagree. I work with people that grow everyday and can see improvements in people.", "Op lied the whole evening about ho he was and in the Moment she found out he instantly left. \nIts understandable that she felt decived and is upset about it.", "Not absolution at all.  Don't tell her it was OK.  Simply say you appreciate the fact she recognizes it was a shitty way to treat someone.  While I wasn't bullied in school, I still knew people who were totally TA.  We never hung out and they weren't my friends.  Years later I'd run across and have conversations with them.  Adult life made them, well, adults.", "Thank you for this, whatyoudoing. I would like to think that the people who gave me a hard time in junior high and high school have changed, and I would appreciate an apology. I would also like to think that I could be forgiven for the things I have done in my own life that were less than admirable.", "You weren\u2019t bullied, so you have no idea the damage these bullies did. They don\u2019t get to play a sob story about how their life was so hard, their daddy issues were so bad, whatever the hell it was that made them toxic, malignant pieces of garbage, and pretend that it makes it all okay. It\u2019s fake, phony manipulation and it\u2019s only ever done to make themselves feel better while they post inspirational quotes on Facebook in between their MLM scams. OP, don\u2019t fall for it.", "I have very different feelings about the people that bullied me. I sometimes wonder if it\u2019s a bad way to think - unhealthy. But I don\u2019t feel bad about it.\nI wouldn\u2019t believe an apology.\nNTA.", "Do you get therapy?"]}
