Just like others have said she's only doing it for herself.", "Of course you're NTA.

The only reason she wants to apologize is to make herself feel better. Same old sob story told by countless people who want to believe they\u2019re better people than they actually are.

If high school life was as miserable as you say, what would be the point in socializing with your former classmates/bullies if you weren't looking for some sort of comeuppance moment like the one you had? \n\nYou're not an AH, but I'm just trying to figure out if you were irritated by the event or if you got exactly what you were looking for.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe any of them anything. Not even your real name.", "NTA.

A good person would want to make amends. Instead, she wants to be forgiven/have a redemption story she can brag about at book club. Her past treatment of you doesn't mesh with her self-image as \"a good person\" - but making this all about her hurt feelings isn't the behavior of \"a good person\" either. She's still lashing out at you for her own gratification.\n\nBlock her, or expose her, but don't engage with her.

How come OP can say they changed so much, got help, and created a new life for themselves, but everyone thinks the bully has not changed in 10 years?

If she really is sorry and really does recognize the gravity of her behavior, then there's no reason why she shouldn't fully understand your reluctance to reveal yourself and potentially be subject to more of the same treatment. Even if she means her apology, she still has some growing up to do. It's not the responsibility of her victims to make themselves available to receive her apology, accept it, or forgive her. Real growth isn't just feeling bad, it's having the maturity to accept that you caused real harm, and understanding that even if you're regretful, you aren't entitled to or guaranteed to receive forgiveness.", "NTA.\n\nThe fact that she is upset about not getting to properly apologize tells me that this isn't just about her regretting her former actions, but also thinking that she deserves absolution.\n\nHer talking to a stranger about how she bullied someone and wants to apologize sounds like she really is sorry for who she was, but not really for what she caused you. It may sound like it's just splitting hairs, but anyone who really wants the other person to know that they acknowledge their wrongdoing and would do things differently now that they've grown up would realize that you basically got an apology and that they wouldn't need to confront you about it if they really cared about you. \n\nHer reaction was then about her, how you stole an opportunity from her, and that sounds an awful lot like she is entitled to be forgiven. But being forgiven is a privilege and not a right, and if she doesn't get that, then she doesn't deserve the forgiveness anyways.", "NTA you do not owe them a single thing. Passing your number around is still bullying.", "Nobody actually changes who they are as a person after they are 9 or 10. They just learn to act different in public.
