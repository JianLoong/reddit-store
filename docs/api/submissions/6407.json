He agreed and apologized for being such an asshole. We also discussed that expressing concern for anyone\u2019s mental health during an argument is not okay and that if there are concerns they can be discussed at a different time. We are going to keep an open dialogue around this to try to make sure we don\u2019t end up having the same arguments over and over again. I will say this argument happened after getting home from spending the weekend with his mother and her family and we were both exhausted and weren\u2019t in the best condition to be fair to each other. \nTo everyone who commented that their SO has no issues with the joke that\u2019s great and I\u2019m happy that you have the same sense of humor and that it works for you, not even has to find all jokes to be funny or be okay with them.", "created_utc": 1672774047, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102gxmc/aita_aruguing_over_a_joke_about_our_wedding/", "score": 454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
