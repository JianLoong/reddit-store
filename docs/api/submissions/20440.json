We're in our mid 20's now and are both currently in committed relationships with long term partners. I have never had feelings for Tom nor has he ever had feelings for me.\n\nSince college, Tom has been a huge watch fanatic. Two months ago, he was showing me this stunning vintage watch and made an off-handed comment about how he would die of joy if he somehow got his hands on one.\n\nVery coincidentally, I was in NYC a few weeks ago and stumbled upon this watch store that just so happened to have the exact one Tom wanted. It was expensive, I wont lie, at about $2,500, but I decided to get it for his 25th birthday (to me, it was basically fate lol). My boyfriend and I do very well financially so this was something that I could personally afford and wanted to buy for Tom, especially knowing how happy it'd make him.\n\nTom has a tradition of hosting a dinner party at his place for his birthday and then following that up with cake and gift opening. I told him before the dinner that my gift was a huge surprise and asked if he could save it for last and he agreed. His girlfriend ends up going first and she gets him this gorgeous sweater that she crocheted for him and a book that he's been wanting, which I thought was super thoughtful and lovely. Last, it was my gift. When he opened it and saw what it was he literally screamed, hopped over a bunch of people, and squeezed me in this huge bear hug. I was SO happy to see him happy, it genuinely filled me with so much joy. He even got emotional and I saw him swipe a few tears. He also said that it was the \"best gift he'd ever received.\" The whole time, his girlfriend was only slightly smiling and stayed quiet.\n\nThe next morning, I get a text from his girlfriend that essentially said that although she appreciated my thoughtful gift, she thought that it was a bit out of touch and lacking awareness. She admitted that Tom had also told her about the watch and she wanted to get it for him, but it was way out of her budget. She accused me of knowing this (I had NO idea) and still getting it to rub it in her face and to \"outshine\" her. She finished by saying how she felt like I had overstepped a boundary by getting the gift and would appreciate me not doing anything similar to it again in the future. I responded and told her that while I could see her POV, I was just trying to do a nice thing for a close friend of mine. I asked her, wouldn't you rather he gotten the gift and seen the happiness that it brought him than him not getting it at all? She responded that that happiness was \"only shared between \\[me\\] and Tom\" and no one else and that she felt hurt by my actions.\n\nOnly my boyfriend knows about this and he's on my side. But thinking through it all again, I do see how I could've overstepped, but my boyfriend says that it's not my job to apologize for her insecurities.

Gift giving is my love language and I'm all for thoughtful gifts, but it feels like the OP isn't being completely honest. I don't think she's stupid, so things aren't adding up.

But this is an insane amount to spend on a platonic friend. Do you get your boyfriend this expensive of gifts? \n\nThis should have been given to him in private, not in front of everyone. You knew it would be a better gift than everyone else and you wanted to get all the credit for it (bc why would you give that expensive of a present in front of a large group?). The decisions here were not completely selfless IMO. Why wouldn\u2019t you ask friends to chip in for it with you so it would be a group gift that he loves from everyone (this would be the more selfless option). Or ask his gf to chip in? And it\u2019s a gift from the two of you. \n\nAlso if he has this party every year, then you should probably already know the vibe of what type of gifts he gets (and how much the gifts are).

Should have been done in private if you wanted it to only be from you.", "NTA Sounds like she was insecure at first and then got upset after stewing on it for a night. \n\nI think it\u2019s valid for her to be a bit upset that he was more excited for your gift than for hers. It was objectively a cooler gift but that doesn\u2019t mean it meant more to him or that you purposely upstaged her. She\u2019s clearly projecting a lot of issues onto you. I think they probably had a conversation at some point where she mentioned she couldn\u2019t afford it for him and that\u2019s what really set her off, that you were able to.\n\nAnd that part about you not being \u201cpart of their happiness\u201d is **ultra cringe**,I don\u2019t know how else to say it. Very insecure and I doubt your close friend feels the same way.", "ESH. Making him save the gift for last was very attention seeking this isn\u2019t about you.", "YTA\n\nThat was a completely innapropriate gift to give a friend. It is far too expensive and far too intimate.\n\nHe will never be able to reciprocate and now your friendship is tainted by the burden of him needing to be grateful and being unable to put the relationship back in equal footing. \n\nThis was also disrespectful to your respective relationships. You know you have no feelings for Tom, and your boyfriend knows that too (hopefully), but every single other person invited to that dinner is going to think otherwise because of this gift and Tom's reaction to it. Same for all of the Reddit strangers who read this. The appearance of something can be just as or even more damning than the actual existence of it, and I have zero doubt you've just brought some nasty rumors and suspicions about your relationship with Tom to life.\n\nThis gift is furtherly innapropriate since it may wreck your friendship with him. His girlfriend is now very, very uncomfortable, thinking she has to be in competition with you. Especially since Tom just publicly declared you the winner in front of all your friends. You know him better than she does, you know him more intimately than she does, you can give him stuff she can't. She is going to want Tom to put in some distance so she can have assurance he doesn't have romantic feelings for you, and so she can put their bond on the fast track to gaining what it lacks without being poisoned by comparisons. He is either going to have to to keep her, damaging his relationship with you, or he's going to have to dump her, which will likely cause him to resent you.\n\nYou really should have thought before you got him something so extravagant, and then changed your mind to something else.", "NTA- though I can\u2019t imagine dropping that much on a friend, ever. I don\u2019t think you had bad intentions, and your partner was on board with it. It\u2019s understandable that she feels outshined- she was- but it wasn\u2019t the purpose of you giving the gift. Her comment that the happiness was only between you two struck me as odd as well. Putting myself into her shoes, I feel like I would be happy my bf got something he wanted so badly, even if it wasn\u2019t from me.", "NTA. Absolutely cool bf btw", "NTA.\nI think it was a very nice present.\nHope the girlfriend gets over it.\nIf not.... your friend still has a really good friend and watch.", "Info: How long has Tom been in this relationship? Is it the first birthday with this girlfriend?", "Info: Are you female?", "NTA. You bought the watch to make your friend happy. It's sad that his girlfriend cares more about her own ego than his happiness.", "NTA some people here should never get in a relationship ong \ud83d\udc80", "NTA.  I hate this idea  that the partners as to be the one that gives the best gift.  I always get happy when my partner get something he wants from some one else.   Why?  Well then I dont have to buy that  and  can focus  on spoiling him on other days and also I get happy seeing him happy.\n\nIf she is so insecure about her and the  relationship  , then the relationship wont last, if she cant share in Toms happiness then she will  build walls and not bridges.\n\nAlso yes giving the gift last was great idea, because he wouldnt have cared about the other  gifts in worse cases and then she would be even more angry.  \n\n\nIf you are going to apologize to her, do it in front of her AND  Tom and say I am sorry I hurt your feeling  with the gift I gave Tom, next time I ask you before giving Tom anything.", "You should have given him the gift privately.

I just saw the watch, became super excited at the coincidence, and was like \"I HAVE to get this for him!\" I definitely could have thought about splitting it between a few people or asking her ahead of time, but it wasn't even a thought in my head due to how excited I was just at the opportunity (plus I was in a rush and leaving NYC that evening so if I didn't get it then, I'd have to go back for it). \n\nI give gifts based on what people want, not the price point.

We're all very friendly and have hung out multiple times, but none of us are that close with her.", "Has anyone considered that it might\u2019ve actually been good that he opened it last? If he opened it in the middle, imagine the pressure of the person who\u2019s up next with their gift. I don\u2019t see the big issue with having a special present go last because no one has to follow it up", "I disagree with you. She was considerate asking it to be the last, because no gift after that would have mattered anymore. If it was the first, all the other gifts would have lost meaning. This way he still enjoyed all the other gifts, and her gift wasn't ruining the gift opening ceremony.", "Well, you'll be happy to know that no one praised me lol. Everyone was just happy to see him happy. They all cheered and clapped, just like after every gift he opened. We have a really supportive friend group, no one's out here specifically showering me with praises to make me and only me look good.", "Yes? I don't see how that's a problem? I couldn't have predicted how he'd react but I was happy to see him happy!", "A huge deal? \nThe whole set up of this immaturity stew is a deal ma\u2019am", "Read my comment again, i mentioned regarding private thing only. You clearly wanted to be the special one that's why your \"end on a special note\" YTA and the gf was not wrong you had ulterior motives.", "Again, no one knew that...", "Yeah - we are just going to disagree then - bc the more I re-read this - I\u2019m just gonna tell ya - you wait until this is done to you, then see how this taste.", "Why would that make me happy?\n\nAlso - have you thought about possibly reading the room ? I know down comment you stated you didn\u2019t even know the GF was aware of his desire for said watch, hear me out on this \u2026.. why would you assume she doesn\u2019t know? What other between you & him things are there exactly? Maybe no one cheered or praised you bc they were dumbstruck at the showboat.", "Yeah you definitely don't see the problem, wait till it happens to you. Karma has a way ALWAYS. PERIOD", "You are delusional. I hope you\u2019re not in a relationship", "YOU, YOUR BF, HIM, HIS GF knew and its not like he wont tell anyone about the price", "Nonyabidness", "I agree with you. If this was done to me I would not have been happy. It\u2019s just attention grabby. Personally I think gifts of this value shouldn\u2019t be purchased for friends or at least reach out to the partner to discuss first, as it sounds like they had each others details.", "Um...you're losing me.\n\nI didn't know she was aware he wanted the watch because I simply didn't know lol. No one told me if she knew.\n\nAll I said was people cheered and clapped after he opened my gift....just like they did after he opened every gift. No one specifically went out of their way to praise me with words.", "...I don't see the problem with his reaction. I'm not sure I understand your comment. Are you upset at him for reacting so positively or me for making him react so positively? I'm lost.", "Yes Karma finds a way so hopefully someone will make her as happy as she made her friend happy. Stop feeling bitter about people's happiness and wishing them bad..", "Yeah...\ud83d\ude33 I'm not sure why she's SO upset\n\nNot sure why I'm being completely demonized by her for just valuing his happiness either...", "He's not the type of person to go around yelling \"LOOK AT MY $2,500 WATCH\". Trust me. \n\nIt doesn't matter that me and my bf knew. Ultimately, the only outsider that knew was his girlfriend.", "Are you by any chance the girlfriend? The way you keep on defending her in every comment is astounding me.", "I think sweetselene is the girlfriend!", "Because you wanted to be the star of the show . You couldve talk to her about it but no it s better to make the situation weird by being the \" friend \" who offer a 3000 dollar gift .", "It\u2019s interesting that you consider the girlfriend the outsider. You\u2019re the outsider of their relationship, and you obviously crossed a boundary whether intended or not. Apologise and move on.", "agreed lol, they are reaching for anything they can \ud83e\udd23"]}
