{"id": 20440, "submission_id": "14hi5ha", "title": "AITA for purchasing my guy friend his dream birthday present and \"outshining\" his girlfriend in the process?", "selftext": "My guy friend, \"Tom,\" has been one of my best friends since college. We're in our mid 20's now and are both currently in committed relationships with long term partners. I have never had feelings for Tom nor has he ever had feelings for me.\n\nSince college, Tom has been a huge watch fanatic. Two months ago, he was showing me this stunning vintage watch and made an off-handed comment about how he would die of joy if he somehow got his hands on one.\n\nVery coincidentally, I was in NYC a few weeks ago and stumbled upon this watch store that just so happened to have the exact one Tom wanted. It was expensive, I wont lie, at about $2,500, but I decided to get it for his 25th birthday (to me, it was basically fate lol). My boyfriend and I do very well financially so this was something that I could personally afford and wanted to buy for Tom, especially knowing how happy it'd make him.\n\nTom has a tradition of hosting a dinner party at his place for his birthday and then following that up with cake and gift opening. I told him before the dinner that my gift was a huge surprise and asked if he could save it for last and he agreed. His girlfriend ends up going first and she gets him this gorgeous sweater that she crocheted for him and a book that he's been wanting, which I thought was super thoughtful and lovely. Last, it was my gift. When he opened it and saw what it was he literally screamed, hopped over a bunch of people, and squeezed me in this huge bear hug. I was SO happy to see him happy, it genuinely filled me with so much joy. He even got emotional and I saw him swipe a few tears. He also said that it was the \"best gift he'd ever received.\" The whole time, his girlfriend was only slightly smiling and stayed quiet.\n\nThe next morning, I get a text from his girlfriend that essentially said that although she appreciated my thoughtful gift, she thought that it was a bit out of touch and lacking awareness. She admitted that Tom had also told her about the watch and she wanted to get it for him, but it was way out of her budget. She accused me of knowing this (I had NO idea) and still getting it to rub it in her face and to \"outshine\" her. She finished by saying how she felt like I had overstepped a boundary by getting the gift and would appreciate me not doing anything similar to it again in the future. I responded and told her that while I could see her POV, I was just trying to do a nice thing for a close friend of mine. I asked her, wouldn't you rather he gotten the gift and seen the happiness that it brought him than him not getting it at all? She responded that that happiness was \"only shared between \\[me\\] and Tom\" and no one else and that she felt hurt by my actions.\n\nOnly my boyfriend knows about this and he's on my side. But thinking through it all again, I do see how I could've overstepped, but my boyfriend says that it's not my job to apologize for her insecurities.

You weren\u2019t thinking of how to hurt her, you just wanted a nice gift for your friend. Your BF is right, you don\u2019t need to apologize for her insecurities", "Nta, presents are presents. Insecurity seems to be surfacing and it\u2019s her problem not yours. Don\u2019t let her ruin a great friendship by pushing you to question your intent.", "NTA - you will still be friends with Tom when he moves on from this relationship.", "NTA\n\nYou were above board. You shared this information with your own boyfriend who doesn't see any ill intent. \n\nI'd save those texts from her just in case this escalates beyond.", "I don't see this as a YTA, NTA question, this is a \"Did you cause an issue in your friendship?\" issue.  This really depends on the GF and how she reacts.  She could respond by slowly but surely cutting you out of Tom's life.  She will start wondering if it is an emotional affair and point out the large cost as evidence.  And scrutinize all future contact.  \n\nShe sounds insecure, I would bet a bit of money that this will occur.  Tom will have to either dump her or distance from you.", "NAH. You\u2019re fine. But her reaction is reasonable too.", "NTA. It's not your fault she's insecure and you had no idea she wanted to get it but couldn't. It's not even like you went out of your way.", "Nta. Her being insecure is not your fault", "Giving him something you knew he really wanted was certainly thoughtful, but telling him to save it for last was attention-seeking. I would feel the same way even if he didn\u2019t have a girlfriend, but especially because he does. I think you were well-intentioned, but should not have made your gift the star of the show in such an obvious way. He would have loved it just as much if you hadn\u2019t showcased it like that & blatantly diminished the gifts everyone else (including his girlfriend) had brought.", "You did cross a boundary. Acknowledge it and apologize and hopefully everyone can move on.", "Maybe YTA. You knew that no matter what anyone gave him that yours would be the best, that's why you wanted to save it for last. Did you really not know you'd be massively outdoing his girlfriend and making her feel insignificant in front of everyone? She's supposed to be his number 1 and you basically shoved her aside to steal the spotlight. Do you regularly give gifts that expensive? If it's your normal thing, maybe you're NTA but otherwise, yeah, I think you are. I'm guessing his reaction made her feel like she is inferior to you. If she didn't feel insecure in their relationship, she would have to after that. After all, she gave her time, talent, and love and it didn't come close to something you threw money at.", "NTA I'm kind of stuck on this shine/outshine thing since it's the bf birthday it's a cheap excuse for her selfish unreasonable disapproval of an expensive toughtful gift .(any other person would have expressed their gratitude )\n\n>that happiness was \"only shared between [me] and Tom\" and no one else\n\nWhat does that even mean? Her gift created happiness shared by everyone? Talk to your friend explain the situation so he could save your friendship (my guess is she'll try to isolate him) \nIt's sad that \"the best gift he has ever received\" will be associated to drama he should reevaluate his relationship!", "you definitely outshined her and her gf doesnt have insecurities. she is just sad and that friend sucks, he literally said your was the best gift infront of everyone and i think that made her sad. just have talk to her again it will be fine, everyone is a adult you all can move on from this drama", "NTA you didn't know that this particular item was something was out of her budget and she was thinking about it. \nMy boyfriend now husband got me a beautiful 1969 record player for my 17th  birthday. That gift wasn't cheap.\nA friend of mine called him and told him that his gift made everyone's else look cheap \nAnd I told her that he will not appoligize for buying me a beautiful and thoughtful gift. \nYou bought him a beautiful gift.", "NTA.  She doesn't love him or she'd be happy he received the thing he wanted most for his birthday regardless of the giver.  I'd say she's just lime green Jell-O... jealous and it's not attractive.", "YTA. It isn't so much \"her insecurities\" as your breech of etiquette giving a gift you knew would significantly outshine all others.", "NTA for buying a present.", "NTa, but make a special effort to patch things up with her if you figure she will be sticking around - nothing worse than having your bff\u2019s partner hating on you.", "NTA, she\u2019s being very insecure.", "NTA, divorce the girlfriend and marry the watch.

I can empathize with how the girlfriend must have felt, but she was out of line to reach out to OP for what was just a kind gesture. \n\nIt\u2019s also what\u2019s in the best interest of her BF\u2026 she should just be happy for him that he was able to get something he really wanted rather than envious she couldn\u2019t provide it. That\u2019s real love", "OP got a nice gift for a good friend. What kind of boundary prohibits that?", "What boundary, buying an gift for a friend?", "Steal the spotlight? It's his birthday any spotlight should be on him.", "How does that make OP the asshole? People get outshined all the time, doesn\u2019t make every outshiner the asshole. OP had good intentions and did something to make her friend happy, the gf should recognize that and not let her own insecurities cloud that.", "The gf handmade something she knew Tom would love and op bought something she knew Tom would love. We don\u2019t need to be acting like money was the entire point of the watch if it was given with real, caring intentions.", "Yeah, your boyfriend got it for you. How would he feel if you had another male friend giving you an incredibly expensive gift he could never afford that you went crazy over? Would your relationship have lasted?", "This is exactly right. If it made him happy, then it should make her happy too if she loves him. It doesn\u2019t matter who got it.", "A $2500 gift for a platonic male friend who ha a girlfriend.\n\nIf you don't want to believe she crossed a boundary that's fine. Me, I wouldn't accept it in front of my partner, because it's too much for a gift from a friend, even if that friend is rich. If my partner is upset about it, all the more reason to not receive it. The GF is reaching out nicely. As a friend, realising that she's stepped in between her friend's relationship, OP can just say sorry.", "\ud83d\udc4c", "Exactly. Are extravagant gifts about the giver or receiver? I guess it depends on her true intentions, which we'll never know. But if she really didn't know the girlfriend couldn't afford the watch, wouldn't she make sure she wasn't getting it for him? He obviously made it known that he wanted it. Gift giving is my love language and I'm all for thoughtful gifts, but it feels like the OP isn't being completely honest. I don't think she's stupid, so things aren't adding up. But I do want to know what gifts she gives to her own boyfriend. How do they compare? Like I said, maybe this is normal for her and she isn't an AH.", "I think it\u2019s sad the kind of limits you have set for relationships that aren\u2019t romantic. Friends are people of overwhelming value and they should be able to give you whatever gift you would want to receive from them.", "I'm old fashion. I don't like to owe people. Family are okay but platonic friends shouldn't give gifts that cost too much. Helping out during times of needs yes, but I would also want to pay them back."]}
