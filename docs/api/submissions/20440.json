We're in our mid 20's now and are both currently in committed relationships with long term partners. I have never had feelings for Tom nor has he ever had feelings for me.\n\nSince college, Tom has been a huge watch fanatic. Two months ago, he was showing me this stunning vintage watch and made an off-handed comment about how he would die of joy if he somehow got his hands on one.\n\nVery coincidentally, I was in NYC a few weeks ago and stumbled upon this watch store that just so happened to have the exact one Tom wanted. It was expensive, I wont lie, at about $2,500, but I decided to get it for his 25th birthday (to me, it was basically fate lol). My boyfriend and I do very well financially so this was something that I could personally afford and wanted to buy for Tom, especially knowing how happy it'd make him.\n\nTom has a tradition of hosting a dinner party at his place for his birthday and then following that up with cake and gift opening. I told him before the dinner that my gift was a huge surprise and asked if he could save it for last and he agreed. His girlfriend ends up going first and she gets him this gorgeous sweater that she crocheted for him and a book that he's been wanting, which I thought was super thoughtful and lovely. Last, it was my gift. When he opened it and saw what it was he literally screamed, hopped over a bunch of people, and squeezed me in this huge bear hug. I was SO happy to see him happy, it genuinely filled me with so much joy. He even got emotional and I saw him swipe a few tears. He also said that it was the \"best gift he'd ever received.\" The whole time, his girlfriend was only slightly smiling and stayed quiet.\n\nThe next morning, I get a text from his girlfriend that essentially said that although she appreciated my thoughtful gift, she thought that it was a bit out of touch and lacking awareness. She admitted that Tom had also told her about the watch and she wanted to get it for him, but it was way out of her budget. She accused me of knowing this (I had NO idea) and still getting it to rub it in her face and to \"outshine\" her. She finished by saying how she felt like I had overstepped a boundary by getting the gift and would appreciate me not doing anything similar to it again in the future. I responded and told her that while I could see her POV, I was just trying to do a nice thing for a close friend of mine. I asked her, wouldn't you rather he gotten the gift and seen the happiness that it brought him than him not getting it at all? She responded that that happiness was \"only shared between \\[me\\] and Tom\" and no one else and that she felt hurt by my actions.\n\nOnly my boyfriend knows about this and he's on my side. But thinking through it all again, I do see how I could've overstepped, but my boyfriend says that it's not my job to apologize for her insecurities.

You knew it would be a better gift than everyone else and you wanted to get all the credit for it (bc why would you give that expensive of a present in front of a large group?). The decisions here were not completely selfless IMO. Why wouldn\u2019t you ask friends to chip in for it with you so it would be a group gift that he loves from everyone (this would be the more selfless option). Or ask his gf to chip in? And it\u2019s a gift from the two of you. \n\nAlso if he has this party every year, then you should probably already know the vibe of what type of gifts he gets (and how much the gifts are).

Should have been done in private if you wanted it to only be from you.", "NTA Sounds like she was insecure at first and then got upset after stewing on it for a night. \n\nI think it\u2019s valid for her to be a bit upset that he was more excited for your gift than for hers. It was objectively a cooler gift but that doesn\u2019t mean it meant more to him or that you purposely upstaged her. She\u2019s clearly projecting a lot of issues onto you. I think they probably had a conversation at some point where she mentioned she couldn\u2019t afford it for him and that\u2019s what really set her off, that you were able to.\n\nAnd that part about you not being \u201cpart of their happiness\u201d is **ultra cringe**,I don\u2019t know how else to say it. Very insecure and I doubt your close friend feels the same way.", "ESH. Making him save the gift for last was very attention seeking this isn\u2019t about you.", "YTA\n\nThat was a completely innapropriate gift to give a friend. It is far too expensive and far too intimate.\n\nHe will never be able to reciprocate and now your friendship is tainted by the burden of him needing to be grateful and being unable to put the relationship back in equal footing. \n\nThis was also disrespectful to your respective relationships. You know you have no feelings for Tom, and your boyfriend knows that too (hopefully), but every single other person invited to that dinner is going to think otherwise because of this gift and Tom's reaction to it. Same for all of the Reddit strangers who read this. The appearance of something can be just as or even more damning than the actual existence of it, and I have zero doubt you've just brought some nasty rumors and suspicions about your relationship with Tom to life.\n\nThis gift is furtherly innapropriate since it may wreck your friendship with him. His girlfriend is now very, very uncomfortable, thinking she has to be in competition with you. Especially since Tom just publicly declared you the winner in front of all your friends. You know him better than she does, you know him more intimately than she does, you can give him stuff she can't. She is going to want Tom to put in some distance so she can have assurance he doesn't have romantic feelings for you, and so she can put their bond on the fast track to gaining what it lacks without being poisoned by comparisons. He is either going to have to to keep her, damaging his relationship with you, or he's going to have to dump her, which will likely cause him to resent you.\n\nYou really should have thought before you got him something so extravagant, and then changed your mind to something else.", "NTA- though I can\u2019t imagine dropping that much on a friend, ever. I don\u2019t think you had bad intentions, and your partner was on board with it. It\u2019s understandable that she feels outshined- she was- but it wasn\u2019t the purpose of you giving the gift. Her comment that the happiness was only between you two struck me as odd as well. Putting myself into her shoes, I feel like I would be happy my bf got something he wanted so badly, even if it wasn\u2019t from me.", "NTA. Absolutely cool bf btw", "NTA.\nI think it was a very nice present.\nHope the girlfriend gets over it.\nIf not.... your friend still has a really good friend and watch.", "Info: How long has Tom been in this relationship?

I hate this idea  that the partners as to be the one that gives the best gift.  I always get happy when my partner get something he wants from some one else.   Why?  Well then I dont have to buy that  and  can focus  on spoiling him on other days and also I get happy seeing him happy.\n\nIf she is so insecure about her and the  relationship  , then the relationship wont last, if she cant share in Toms happiness then she will  build walls and not bridges.\n\nAlso yes giving the gift last was great idea, because he wouldnt have cared about the other  gifts in worse cases and then she would be even more angry.  \n\n\nIf you are going to apologize to her, do it in front of her AND  Tom and say I am sorry I hurt your feeling  with the gift I gave Tom, next time I ask you before giving Tom anything.", "You should have given him the gift privately.

I just saw the watch, became super excited at the coincidence, and was like \"I HAVE to get this for him!\" I definitely could have thought about splitting it between a few people or asking her ahead of time, but it wasn't even a thought in my head due to how excited I was just at the opportunity (plus I was in a rush and leaving NYC that evening so if I didn't get it then, I'd have to go back for it). \n\nI give gifts based on what people want, not the price point.

We're all very friendly and have hung out multiple times, but none of us are that close with her.", "Has anyone considered that it might\u2019ve actually been good that he opened it last? If he opened it in the middle, imagine the pressure of the person who\u2019s up next with their gift. I don\u2019t see the big issue with having a special present go last because no one has to follow it up", "I disagree with you. She was considerate asking it to be the last, because no gift after that would have mattered anymore. If it was the first, all the other gifts would have lost meaning. This way he still enjoyed all the other gifts, and her gift wasn't ruining the gift opening ceremony.", "Well, you'll be happy to know that no one praised me lol. Everyone was just happy to see him happy. They all cheered and clapped, just like after every gift he opened. We have a really supportive friend group, no one's out here specifically showering me with praises to make me and only me look good.", "Yes? I don't see how that's a problem? I couldn't have predicted how he'd react but I was happy to see him happy!", "A huge deal? \nThe whole set up of this immaturity stew is a deal ma\u2019am", "Read my comment again, i mentioned regarding private thing only.

I know down comment you stated you didn\u2019t even know the GF was aware of his desire for said watch, hear me out on this \u2026.. why would you assume she doesn\u2019t know? What other between you & him things are there exactly?

If this was done to me I would not have been happy. It\u2019s just attention grabby.

No one told me if she knew.\n\nAll I said was people cheered and clapped after he opened my gift....just like they did after he opened every gift. No one specifically went out of their way to praise me with words.", "...I don't see the problem with his reaction. I'm not sure I understand your comment. Are you upset at him for reacting so positively or me for making him react so positively? I'm lost.", "Yes Karma finds a way so hopefully someone will make her as happy as she made her friend happy. Stop feeling bitter about people's happiness and wishing them bad..", "Yeah...\ud83d\ude33 I'm not sure why she's SO upset\n\nNot sure why I'm being completely demonized by her for just valuing his happiness either...", "He's not the type of person to go around yelling \"LOOK AT MY $2,500 WATCH\".

The way you keep on defending her in every comment is astounding me.", "I think sweetselene is the girlfriend!", "Because you wanted to be the star of the show .

It was never a stable relationship if something as simple as a gift is enough to create ripples in it.

He should have warned her that his girlfriend is sensitive to things like that. \n\nThis is of course unless there is any history of his girlfriend being uncertain of the relationship between OP and her friend (which; would still not be on OP, but then she should have been more careful). \n\nPeople need to think about if they perceive gift giving as a ritual meant primarily for the receiver or the giver. He loved the gift, and there should be no need to downscale it to protect other peoples ego as we are not talking about young children being bought with gifts here. The value of a gift should not be measured in the cost anyway, it is about finding something special for that person. And it sounds like the girlfriend gave a super nice one too, it just was not as unexpected. \n\nThe dopamin high he must have gotton from the watch gift is insaaane. And from an event perspective it totally makes sense to save it for last. Now the others got to enjoy his happy face without having to measure it up against the big one. \n\nAlso: it does not sound like OP does this as a rule. I too give mye friends gifts I want to give them, and dont follow rules for what it has to cost. Sometimes they are homemade, sometimes cheap and sometimes expensive.  It's more about finding something that the receiver will love.", "NTA, She's bitter because she couldn't get it for him.\nIt's hard because I'm similar, when it was our 10 year wedding anniversary I booked a couple of nights away not to far or expensive, it was what I could afford.\nMy brother has booked 5 nights in an exotic place for his 10 year and they've been talking about how great its going to be, it's not to rub it in our faces their just excited, but it made me feel shitty due to jealousy", "NTA, but its tacky as hell to open presents with everyone around like a competition.", "NTA.

You wanted not just to bask in his reaction , you wanted an audience to this declaration of your greatness.", "I think yes, you are a bit TA, especially since you specifically wanted it to be opened last because you assumed your gift would be the best. That hubris alone icks me out. But honestly, the birthday boy is the biggest AH here as he said that it was the *best* gift he's ever received, in front of his girlfriend who gave him a handmade gift.

It sucks not being able to provide the people you love with things that mean something to them, especially when you know how seen and loved that would make them feel. But she should have discussed that with him, and not you. It\u2019s not about the money.

SAVE TOM! SAVE TOM!", "NTAi don't understand why people get so upset over who gives whom what present. Unless it's something genuinely innappropriate, why can't people just be happy that their loved one got something they wanted??\n\nLike, if someone got my partner some equivalent of this, I'd probably just think either \"Damn I wish I'd thought of that\" or \" Oh shit that's generous!\"", "OR she could be happy for her bf.

Mostly bc they don\u2019t exist.  But yeah. Seems like your intentions were pure and the gf is a ball of jealous/frustrated/disappointed, which is 45% understandable. Hopefully she can see you had good intentions and her bf\u2019s joy and y\u2019all can move on.  Buuuut I do think you are going to have to get your BF a very nice present this year lol", "Imma go with esh cause I understand her point of view and so should you how would you feel if someone got your bf a gift like that? But also her text to you was uncalled for. I think you her and Tom need to sit down and see what boundaries need to be put in place and also will give everyone the time to talk it out and have an ADULT conversation about it! No talking over each other n all that just give your sides and feelings and talk it out!", "I feel like the people who are saying NTA are mostly looking at it through whether OP was trying to make a romantic move on her friend or not. I think it's clear that it was meant solely as a platonic gesture. But that doesn't absolve her from the accusation of acting inappropriately/TA. \n\n\nIt seems that for whatever reason (out of budget, wrong time, whatever) the $2500 vintage watch wasn't an immediate expenditure OP's friend was willing to make at that time. And the way it works with gifts is that when we receive something that we  *really* want or that is *rly* special from someone, we see it as proof that that individual cares very deeply about us. But the complication arises here bc since the gift was so expensive it's not just a matter of who's willing to put in the effort. It's a matter of who has the means to give it. His gf, unfortunately did not. By you giving the gift instead, you made it seem as though you were most willing. You were not. You just had the privilege to make it happen. \n\nWhich is great but the reason your friend asked his *gf* for that gift is bc for most people the most important person in their life is their SO: that's who they care about the most and who cares about them the most. I mean if your friend knows you can afford such items (assuming he knows you have a high salary) then he could have asked you for the gift. But he didn't. Bc it's *inappropriate* to ask for something so intimate from a friend. And thats what a meaningful AND out of budget gift is - a demonstration of intimacy (intimacy meaning closeness. In this situation its clearly not romantic). That's not a role a friend plays in ones life, ESP if they have a SO. \n\nAnd you kind of said it yourself. On one hand in your comments you said you weren't trying to get praise from your friends and that no one applauded you or anything. But on the other hand you said they weren't aware or how expensive it was. if your friends knew the value (both monetary and sentimental) the watch had for your friend, I think it's very likely they would have felt slighted as well. Because his gf said it best:  giving the most desired gift is a happiness and intimacy between *just* you and your friend. \n\nI know you were just trying to do something nice for your friend but the way you went about it just wasnt the best. I feel like you could have reached out to his gf regarding the watch, telling her you were interested in buying it for him and asking her if she wanted to split the cost or something like that. \n\nI do feel like you're soft YTA for your oversight bc you had good intentions and didn't know as much about the situation as you do now. But i think youre a massive YTA for the way you invalidated her emotions when you responded to his gf and for doubling down in the comments.", "Hmmm you\u2019re one of \u201cthose\u201d people.

N T A for getting the gift but YTA for how you gave it. Do you realise that jumper probably took the girlfriend more than a month to make and you completely took away the significance of that?\n\nPersonally I\u2019d appreciate a gift more if someone spent weeks making it rather than money on it. Time is the most precious gift you can give someone.", "Yta, you shouldve texted the gf and gone in on it with her", "Asking him open it last shows you knew it would outshine everyone. \n\nIf it was me I would have given a big gift like that privately", "Soft YTA. You were well-intentioned, but making a show out of it was a bit weird for, I think, everyone. Personally, I am super into making gifts. I love it. I take pride in taking the time to find the perfect gift for each person I love, for me it is a way to show that I care and I listen to them, and I know them well and can pick something specific for them. So I absolutely get that sometimes you find That Perfect Thing, and even if it is awkwardly expensive, you still have to. But what I personally do when that happens is either give it privately to the person before the event if an event ks planned, or text at least a few more people and make it into a group gift so that no one is excluded.\n\n\nEDIT: upon reading that the price is not wild for your friend group, I think maybe you accidentally stepped into a sensitive topic for the girlfriend. It clearly must be outside of their budget, or your friend would have got the watch for himself. One has to be careful with money issues when it comes to those who are not close enough for us to know about their money situation. I would say you were more accidentally privileged than intentionally AH.", "YTA - if i knew his birthday was coming up and i knew gift was expensive(even after you bought it)  i would hit up some of people attending and try to split cost between them to get him his dream watch. If they didnt want to, just give it but otherwise you could make it group gift since its cost is way over whats usually birthday budget gift imo.", "NTA. She's insecure as fuck. She's acting like a possessive psycho. It's a watch, not a BJ.\n\nEdit OP says GF said happiness is only shared between the GF and the friend. Wtf?", "Unless you all are millionaires and make a habit of spending that much on each other YTA. You could have given that to him privately.

(We are both women who have had serious relationships with men in the past, so, kind of it doesn't matter if it came from a man or woman)", "All I can see in this story is Tom fishing for a very expensive watch in the lead up to his birthday. Nice work Tom! \n\nIt\u2019s strange to me, too, that his girlfriend would give him such meaningful and personal gifts in front of everyone, rather than in private. Maybe it\u2019s done differently where you are\u2026", "NTA. As long as you could you could easily afford this gift", "YTA.

But I would be so happy to see someone I love get something that made them so happy.", " Soft YTA Seems like you did want to be the center of attention by telling him to wait for last. A $2500 watch is a HUGE gift. You really didn\u2019t know that the gf could not have afforded such a gift? \n\nYou really made sure that you got all the accolades that night. I think you need to re-examine your motives here, and maybe ask yourself why it was so important that you one-upped his girlfriend.", "NTA Honestly, imo, I don't think how much you spent was really the problem for her. What she is really upset about is he didn't scream, hop over people, grab her up in a hug, get teary-eyed and thank HER for what SHE got him. Doesn't matter that he probably loved and appreciated what she gave him just as much. He didn't give her the high praise in front of everyone she felt she was due. So when he was justifiably surprised and overjoyed about your gift  and expressed it, she got her panties in a twist!! You owe her NOTHING!! What you did was incredibly sweet.

I understand you are close, but are you sure he told you about every birthday gift ever ? Besides, breaking a tradition to avoid hurting someone would have been completely understandable...\n- people know vintage watch are expensive, even if they don't know how much it actually cost, it would still be clear that it wasn't a cheap gift\n- you could have gotten the watch and still ask them to chip in afterwards if they wanted/were able to. You're framing it like asking them to chip in was something you would have had to have an answer for before buying the gift, but it's not the case. A simple text of \"hey folks, I've just found a super gift for Tom, would you like to make it a group gift ?\" would have sufficed and things would have been far less awkward for the girlfriend. \n\nSometimes we make honest mistakes that hurt people, it doesn't make us horrible people if we recognize it and apologize.

In a perfect world, we wouldn't care about that, but in the world we live in, it does unfortunately create some form of hierarchy between people. OP made sure she was on top of that particular pyramid in this case, and I gather (possibly wrongly, in which case I'm the asshole as well) that she is quite aware of that and is presenting the situation in a biased way to be absolved of any wrongdoings. \nLife can be surprising, and good on her if she did actually find the watch by chance, but it doesn't ring very true to my hears.

This applies for birthdays, wedding, house warming etc. There's an etiquette as to what items and price range for these things, and unless you're very close, you should stick to it. This applies women to women too. For example, I always aim to give around $20-30 gift for kid's birthday present and expect around the same for my kids' birthday, and it's actually annoying when someone spend too much and I have to now spend more for their kid's birthday too. \n\nI don't think gifts define a relationship.

Ive also talked to my friends so\u2019s if I\u2019m getting them an important gift that I know it\u2019s something they want in case they are already planning on buying it.", "i think most of the people reply like this because theyre jealous they dont have a friend/girlfriend like you lmao\n\nyou did fine, it was a lovely gesture. my gf and i hardly get gifts for each other anymore, unless theres something we know the other wants (instead we spoil each other on special days). if one of her friends or my friends got us a really special gift that we were super happy with, we would be grateful. i dont get people with such insecurities that they think they always have to look like the best person to their partner. only on wedding days lol", "Whatever you say chief. There's no etiquette around gifts if you're actually friends. I bought my friend a PS5 for their birthday last year, her and her boyfriend use it to play cod with me all the time.

Then everyone did additional gifts on top of that. When they got me a new big present, it was from everyone too, when we get the next person a big gift, it\u2019ll be from everyone again.

Not that I consider her an outsider to us!!", "Very interesting choice of word indeed.", "I would buy them ALL the things if I can afford it. I\u2019ll check with my friend first but if they were my friend they would not have a problem with it.", "I'm not biting my dude, if someone wants to get the group to chip in for a \"big gift\" it's on them to bring it up, e.g. OPs mates gf could've asked the group to chip money in towards the watch her bf reeeeally wanted. Nothing was said, OP made the right choice getting it imo.", "NTA. OP, your best bet is to stop responding to these comments. Some of people have nothing better to do and are going to pick apart your every word. \n\nTo me, it doesn\u2019t seems that you had any negative motives, just that you\u2019re well off financially and maybe a little out of touch with how big gifts like that make come across. \n\nMajority of the population doesn\u2019t even have $2500 to blow on themselves randomly much less a friend. So, no matter how innocent your intentions were, I think it\u2019s probably understandable the GF felt weird about it. It\u2019s also probably why others can\u2019t wrap their head around you buying a friend something expensive without ulterior motives. I would just reach out and tell her something like, \u201cHey i\u2019m sorry I made you feel that way. I didn\u2019t think about it being an issues, I was just excited I got lucky enough to find that watch and had the opportunity to buy it. I\u2019ll be mindful in the future.

By asking for him to open it last and telling him it was a big surprise was clearly attention-seeking behavior. You knew it would outshine all other gifts. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you do other things in your friendship that make his girlfriend uncomfortable. If you truly just wanted to make him happy with a grand gesture, you could (and should) have given it in private.", "YTA. You were attention-seeking on the grand scale. Tom is an attention-seeker too or he wouldn't have *screamed* what he did. GF had better dump him, get her sweater back and the book if it's a good one, and find herself a non-egomaniac. You and Tom can be drama llamas together.", "YTA - You knew full well that it would be the star gift and set it up so you were the centre of attention. The fact that you assumed that the girlfriend didn\u2019t know about the watch reads like you've convinced yourself that you and Tom are closer than the two of them are, which is a little weird. Her message sounds completely measured and reasonable, but from your constant justifications it really doesn't sound like you are willing to take that feedback on board.", "YTA. You insisted on it being last, the encore, what everyone would remember.  Something like that should have been private.

You're not a good friend for wanting to cause drama in his life.", "What did you think was gonna happen lol? Her reaction was justified.", "YTA, I think what you did was intentional, especially when you asked him to open your gift last. You come off a bit jealous and probably have feelings for this guy.

You could have given your gift privately.", "Ooof, idek how to label this. \n\nHis girlfriend took a lot of time, effort and energy in crocheting a sweater for her boyfriend. That takes skill and patience. She most likely had to get his measurements in order to make sure the sweater actually fits him. The sweater she made was a product of her love and labor. On top of it, she got a specific book he\u2019s been wanting. I don\u2019t blame her for feeling the way she\u2019s feeling because despite her gifts, she doesn\u2019t feel good enough.

Maybe an obligatory hug and kiss with the lines of \u201cthank you so much, babe.\u201d He definitely didn\u2019t scream from happiness when he saw her gifts. It must\u2019ve stung when he proclaimed publicly that your gift was the best one because now it seems that her gift is useless compared to yours. \n\nYou\u2019re wealthy, generous and presumably attractive. On top of it, a good memory. His girlfriend must fear the worst. I just wonder if he\u2019s with his gf because he couldn\u2019t get you.

Why did you do that? You claim you just wanted to do something nice for him - this doesn\u2019t need a show.

So YTA and you could at least talk to your friend and let him know that although maybe true, him tearfully declaring it \u201cbest gift ever\u201d in front of everyone, especially the GF, was kinda tactless.

You made a point of asking Tom to leave your present until last because you knew it was going to be a show stopper. This to me indicates that while you wanted to give Tom something amazing, you also wanted some of the limelight. This could be completely subconscious by the way so I'm not saying you're a bad person. Part of gift giving is that warm fuzzy feeling we get when the recipient loves our gift.\n\nSo why do I think you were wrong in giving this amazing gift to Tom during his celebrations and in the dramatic fashion of saving it until last? \n1. You knew it was extravagant and likely to blow everyone away so that includes his gf who put the entire party together and *spent time* making her birthday gift to him. You completely disregarded how the host would feel.\n2. Again, you went out of your way to get maximum effect by telling Tom your present was a surprise (aren't most presents a surprise?) and asking him to give it a special place in the unwrapping. You were sensible enough not to ask for 1st so you went with last so that every other gift paled in comparison.\n\nThe better way to have gifted Tom his birthday gift was in private. Either the day after or later after the party ended. This moment between friends (if genuine) is between two people. \n\nYou are not responsible for anyone else's feelings but you are responsible for not being out of touch and crass by outshining the host for your own need for recognition and acknowledgement.\n\nI won't go into that need to be acknowledged as someone special in Tom's life.", "YTA for being attention seeking.

Sure, you say you can afford a $2500 gift, but how would you feel if a \u201cplatonic\u201d (in quotes because even if it\u2019s truly platonic, I guarantee every single person at that party thinks otherwise now) female friend of your bf\u2019s publicly gave him a $15000 dream gift? A gift so immense that it basically makes the gift you gave him seem almost insignificant.\n\nMen and women can totally be friends, but there are still boundaries. My wife has a brother and a sister. I\u2019m friends with both, but my wife\u2019s sister and I especially get along. Despite that, if I treated my sister-in-law the same way I treat my brother-in-law, people would think I\u2019m hitting on her.\n\nOn top of that, this gift is going to strain your friendship with Tom even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it now. The \u201crule of reciprocity\u201d is instilled in most of us at a very early age. In the future, Tom is likely going to overspend on your gifts because he feels obligated to. He might even spend more on your gifts than his gf\u2019s because he\u2019ll always feel the need to repay you.\n\nYour gift was nice and thoughtful, but still a stupid thing to do.", "YTA - the value of the gift was far, far too high for a friend gift.  Not because it was a bad thought or a mean thing to do, but because the etiquette for gift giving is to give a gift of around the same value as what you might expect to receive in return.\n\nIf you and your partner give a gift that your friend\u2019s partner can\u2019t afford then you aren\u2019t going to get anything like the same value in return from them. And that embarrassed them *even if you never expected that kind of reciprocation* - and even if your friend isn\u2019t aware of this, his gf might be.\n\nAlso, if she can\u2019t afford to reciprocate then even if he can, they as a committed couple probably need to prioritise that (significant amount of) money on the kinds of things committed couples in their mid 20s need money for like saving for a wedding or the deposit for a house/bigger house, travel etc. So if he decides to adhere to convention and gift you something of equivalent value, that ends up setting their saving plans back. She has every right to feel embarrassed about that but also angry that she herself would need to work to make up the shortfall in favour of a gift she doesn\u2019t get to enjoy.\n\nSo as well as giving someone else\u2019s partner an inappropriately ostentatious gift, you\u2019ve embarrassed her publicly for her finances and, potentially, obligated them to return the favour to you. At the very least you should make it very clear that the reciprocation aspect is not important and you don\u2019t want to see that favour returned.\n\nEven if you genuinely meant well (I\u2019m  wondering how you could be so gauche as to not realise that splashing cash like this is not appropriate) the embarrassment to his partner is not negated by that.\n\nAlso, whilst it isn\u2019t a factor in whether any of you are assholes in this instance or not, if your friend is able to accept a gift of such value that it\u2019s out of his/his partner\u2019s range to buy it for himself, then you need to consider whether he values your friendship for you and your company, or because you\u2019re wealthy and generous. You\u2019ve given no indications that he\u2019s gold digging in his friendship with you so I won\u2019t judge him on that but financial imbalances in generosity like this are not without problems for the giver as well as the receiver.", "This sort of reads as YTA, and you know it.

Saying \u2018this is the best gift ever\u2019 after having received a raft of other presents, including truly thoughtful ones, was thoughtless.\n\nAnd if Best Friend and Girlfriend can\u2019t hear eachother over that, they have issues.\n\nSo I\u2019m going ESH", "That\u2019s how I first read this, but the [me] in brackets indicates that OP was the person who shared Tom\u2019s happiness. The GF is complaining that the happiness of the gift was only shared by OP and Tom, and no one else.", ">She needs to accept that just because you\u2019re someone\u2019s SO, that doesn\u2019t mean you will be the only one to provide your partner with happiness in their life.\n\nExactly right! Some people believe that when they are with someone, no one else is allowed to make them happy. I want my SO happy in all aspects of life. That means with me, family, and friends. \n\nI would have done what OP if I could afford it, too. (I've actually purchased a watch for my friend. Not $2500 but still a nice one.)\n\nNTA.", "I had the same thought, if the gift had been from his best male friend, GF wouldn't have had an issue.  Did OP think her gift would \"outshine\" everyone else? I'd say yes as requesting it be opened last was a \"save the best for last\" move.", "She didn\u2019t say that, she said the happiness during the moment the gift was given was only shared between OP and Tom. She felt bad that she wasn\u2019t a part of her bf\u2019s \u201cbig\u201d bday gift and felt that her gift paled in comparison, so she didn\u2019t share their happiness in that moment.\n\nGf seems a bit insecure, but OP also seems attention-seeking. Overall I\u2019d say NAH though, this was an issue of seemingly good intentions but bad communication", "As a knitter (useless when it comes to crochet because my hands want the thread to go in the other way) who set a rod for my own back by deciding to knit a scarf each as part of my partners Christmas gift. I feel your pain. I also know my partner recognises how long it takes as in the last 5yrs it\u2019s become every other yr as I have increasingly less time in my life to do it. We don\u2019t know the partners behind the scenes reaction, but if he doesn\u2019t recognise how much love goes into handmade knitwear maybe they aren\u2019t compatible but the issue is between the couple and OP\u2019s gift is between OP and the birthday boy, it\u2019s possible that the GF is confusing the two and misdirecting her hurt feelings.", "This comment makes the most mature assessment of the actual issue. It's not about cost, gifts, or Tom's reaction. It's about the energy and respect you put into the partners of friends you love and care about. OP's NTA for a lovely and generous gift, nor simply being a good friend who doesn't pinch pennies, which I love, but obviously there is a bridge to the girlfriend which has been neglected. Considering her feelings was not and continues to not be a priority for OP. \n\nOP- also from reading your responses, the price point is the elephant in the room. It's not relevant to you, but it's relevant to your good friend's partner. Insisting it is irrelevant is tone deaf to what actually happened", "OP did not play that card though. \n\nDid you see OP\u2019s comment about how one of his other (male) friends bought him an EXPENSIVE painting by his favourite artist. \nWould he have also thought about not giving that gift to the friend to \u201cspare\u201d his gf?", "I saw another comment by OP saying that the gf never put much effort into the friend group & that she\u2019s not that close with them. But it\u2019s the same with the gf\u2019s friend group & OP\u2019s friend. \n\nMaybe she just meant that OP\u2019s friend was not as involved. \nI doubt she believes she\u2019s more important than the gf. \n\nI\u2019ll circle back to the comment saying one of the friends other friends bought him a very expensive painting by his favourite artist. Do you see this as also telling the gf he\u2019s more important than her?", "You're telling me mentioned it offhandedly ONE TIME and you impulsively spent $2500 on it? Dang. How did you even remember the specific details of this watch to recognize it after one quick, offhanded comment? I don't believe you. And if you are telling the truth, you need to set better boundaries in your relationships. You overstepped. \n\nDo you have something against her? You seriously could not have been so naive not to realize how a gift like this would affect their relationship. It simply wasn't your place. Buy it and then split it with people if you have to get something like that. He'd still get the watch but you wouldn't make yourself the center of attention. After all, it should be about your friend getting something he'd love and not about you giving an extravagant gift.", "Didn't you say in another comment he literally sent you a screenshot of the watch?", "Op if you become my friend i will accept all the gifts with zero drama, promise", "OP specifically told him to save their gift for last because it was super special. That was the reaction OP was hoping for, they knew exactly what they were doing. Whether or not they'd thought about how other people around them would perceive it is another matter but either way it's thoughtless at best and deliberately being an asshole at worst.", "She\u2019s a \u201cpick me\u201d", "Who cares if it\u2019s better? Just smile and accept good things in your life. It\u2019s not a friend he made last week. There are no ill intentions. Yes the gf got butthurt but she can see from years of actions this girl doesn\u2019t want her bf. She can get over it. Her texting the friend made this so weird. Can\u2019t people just brush things off and move on these days. Not everything is thinking about others feelings all the times. So self involved", "Layers to the OP's onion", "Yikes. Yeah you are an asshole. You should have made an effort to include her in the gift. It's not difficult. The least you can do now is just drop it.", "Gifting something large to someone in a long term relationship should involve a discussion with their partner. Whether it's your friend, sibling, etc. That is not only to be courteous, but also to avoid duplicate gifts. I would be incredibly upset if my SISTER gifted me something like this without my husband's knowledge, just as I would be upset if his sister did the same.\nThis simply comes down to respecting the relationship, which you clearly do not.", "I honestly think \"we're just best friendsssss\" is delusional in most cases and should be avoided in relationships \ud83d\ude05 \nIf there are was made a worldwide poll, I'd guess that 97% of women would vote that their male best friend eventually tried to get in their pants.", "I even consider expensive watches the sort of gift you give your partner after they propose. One gets a ring, the other gets a watch, or jewelry if they wear it, something like that.", "Exactly! Also, this gift could have been given separately. if it was just about making him happy. While I don\u2019t know if she asked to be last for their benefit or hers, I do believe it was the wrong move to give that gift in front of everyone in general. $2,500 on a gift for someone you aren\u2019t romantically involved with is a bit odd. That\u2019s literally rent (or more!) for people. I can\u2019t help but to think it\u2019s kind of a weird flex to do this. Especially because OP felt the need to mention she and her bf are well off and can afford it. No need to announce this, any sane person would imagine you can afford it if you actually did it. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think this is more of a case of someone being unaware of their surroundings and the perception they put off and less about the person being an AH tbh. I say this because I\u2019m sure the gift game from a good place, but perception is important and seeing it from other people\u2019s point of view is important. I\u2019m sure the gf wasn\u2019t the only one uncomfortable. I\u2019d feel some way if I got my friend something I thought was nice and within my budget and it was outshined by this. \n\nAgain, it could have been given separately but instead absolutely spotlight was put on it.", "I\u2019ve known by best friend for 24 years. We got each other $100 this year as gifts.", "I think it's relevant how much OP normally spends on gifts for friends. If she's really wealthy and normally buys friends expensive gifts, that makes it seem less like a stunt. OTOH if OP normally gives friends <$100 gifts and spent her savings to buy this watch, that would be really inappropriate. \n\nI'm also rubbed the wrong way by the way OP asked the friend to save her gift for last. She might have had good intentions but it makes the whole thing feel performative. \n\nTop comments are saying the girlfriend is insecure, but I think she had a reasonable reaction to a kind of delicate situation.", "[removed]", ">during a global recession?\n\nWe aren't in a global recession", "That story, and I remember it as well, was so much more nuanced too\n\nHis friend had bought him...sport team merch? I feel like I remember football Jersey?\n\nHe bought her, roughly equivalent priced, 2 tickets to a small, not widely known band she liked, no flashiness or showmanship intended, because other friends and her boyfriend and his girlfriend had all dropped the ball and got her tacky \"I forgot\" tier gifts, he got slated for \"outshining\" everyone...the tickets were cheap they just required thought and care regarding \"oh that's that band that 'Leah' is raving about at the moment and that venue is a reasonable travel distance, and wow tickets are only $25 each before booking fees+tax. But she's a woman so obviously she'll need at least one companion for safety reasons so I'll buy her 2 and leave her to find a Concert buddy\"\n\nThere were hundreds of verdicts on that and I was one of about 12 who didn't immediately hit him with Y-T-A", "Antique/vintage watches that are coveted don\u2019t tend to be widely available. I was given an old watch by my great granny for my play jewellery when I was little, it has a tiny face with a scribble on it and the strap was like a ribbon but made of metal. In my teens I rotated it into my everyday jewellery. As an adult I occasionally wear it, just because I think it\u2019s pretty and reminds me of my granny who was a bit of a fire cracker so I like to think it takes her energy with me into negotiations or important moments. I thought it was costume jewellery that I happened to like, until I went to get my engagement ring valued for our insurance I thought I\u2019d never had any jewellery valuable enough that I needed to insure it. He assumed I was there to have the watch valued because of the brand, that not many were made and very few retained the original straps (we have small wrists!) After finding that out, it turned out retaining that play jewellery because of it\u2019s sentimental value was a wise move because apparently great grannies pirate chest was of more value than she knew or let us know anyway. Unfortunately by the time I knew she had passed away, so I never got to properly thank her, but nanny had played with it too and knew that it was jewellery she had been given by young men in her youth that she had kept and told her father was paste. If I was to sell that tiny watch it would be worth more than OP\u2019s gift, but if someone saw it they might think it was pretty but it isn\u2019t look at me flashy jewellery.

She is clearly very young and verb dumb. She\u2019s probably in finance.", "Ah, I missed the age too! \n\nI still stand by my thoughts on sharing the expense as a group or with the gf but now I would lean towards a YTA vote because it is an overstep based on the extent of the friendship and the glory seeking undertones of OP.", "Of course they are. But I wouldn't ask my friend to save my gift for last knowing it would outshine everyone else's. I also would speak to their SO knowing the exorbitant amount of money I planed on spending and maybe ask her if she wanted to contribute a bit (even 5$) as say the gift was from both of us.\n\nMy friends are my family, but keeping relationships (romantic and platonic) happy and healthy should also be taken into account.

I think it's respectful to all parties involved and keeps everything above board to avoid any misunderstandings.", "Seconded. We do not know what the norm is within this group.

I hope my partner and I will be together forever, but assuming no major disaster I guarantee his bestie will be. I also know that his bestie will know things about him that I don\u2019t, and vice Versa. I really dislike the idea that we have to have one special person and it must be our romantic partner. Of course our romantic partner is important but so are our parents, long term friends and pets.

I behave differently towards my male friends when they're in a relationship than I do towards my female friends, because I'm aware that their partners might feel insecure. is that reasonable across the board? maybe not, but it *happens*, and I care more about getting along with my friend's partner, than being objectively right. I played the \"this is my friend and you don't get to define our relationship\" card when I was younger, and it brought me nothing but misery. as you grow up you learn to choose your battles, and choosing to respect a loved one of a loved one isn't hard to do anyway. some of those women have turned out to be my closest friends, even after they've broken up. because they could tell I wasn't just playing nice, I genuinely wanted to get to know them\n\nmy best friend has never seriously dated a woman who I didn't get on with like peanut butter and jelly. when I find out he's seriously seeing someone, my thought isn't \"how do I establish my position in the pecking order.\" it's \"WOOO NEW FRIEND who is guaranteed to be awesome and I didn't have to put any work into finding\"", "That friend didn't insist on saving it for last, which is what really pushes OP into AH territory.", "What do you mean the way it was delivered spoiled it\u2019s thoughtfulness? \n\nHe just opened the gift at his birthday party.

People who are more worried about being \"right\" and letting the other person fester in their pain are clearly more devoted to their own self-image. Who are you? \n\nI didn't read all 500+ comments, but in the many I did read, I saw nothing about the gf's present. She MADE him a sweater. I have made a sweater and am working on another now. I'm not great at it yet, so I know my attitude of it will change a bit when I'm more accomplished. But what I think will never change is what I put into these projects of myself. That's my time, my creativity, my love. When I'm working on it, I'm thinking of that person. When I'm designing it, I'm thinking of that person. I want it to be loved and meaningful. I would feel so hurt if someone else's \"better\" gift was given at the same time as this gift I poured so many hours and so much love into. If you didn't know she was giving that or didn't understand the significance, then be retroactively apologetic and be sure to compliment the sweater when he wears it. \n\n(Not every crafter is like me, so maybe she doesn't care as much about her creations; but what I've seen of others seems to indicate that large knitted/crocheted gifts tend to carry a desire for appreciation.)", "Why would you be upset if your sister did something like this without telling your husband?

That's a lot of money for a gift, so I'm not saying that it's cheap, but in the watch world, if something only costs $2,500, it isn't a rarity.", "But doesn't it also depend on the person's income? I don't know how much OP makes but it sounds like she makes really good money (which I would assume so if she can casually drop $2.5k without a second thought!). If $2.5k for her is $250 or even $25 for someone else, then I don't think it's that outrageous? Especially if her love language is giving gifts. \n\nIt didn't sound like OP's boyfriend was at all upset or surprised about his gf spending thousands of dollars on this bday gift, and based on her other comments, it sounds like it's just something she does a lot.

The only way I wouldn't is if I felt they were trying to actually coerce/convince my SO of who is a better partner, which I've had happen before, but I had a conversation directly with my SO of how competitive that person was and how they weren't the problem, he was for encouraging that competition. \n\n(He told me to try harder to prove I was better for him than them lol. I let them win. He didn't like them so it got awkward.)\n\nEither way - to be honest, the fault wasn't with OP. They shouldn't have to share credit for a gift they bought to make the GF happy.

The idea that it shouldn't be a competition work both way. \n\nOP went and got a very thoughtful gift, which is an awesome gesture. But the fact that it also was an expensive one does place it in a different category because it becomes a reflection of social status and ultimately, social power. This is were it could have been handled differently. \n\nReading through comments though, I can see how giving it to him privately would not have made much of a difference. The best move might have been a heads up, or, as stated, an opportunity to \"share the credit\" (which doesn't have to mean \"divide in equal parts\" as well, because it might still be too steep). \n\nJust as an example : \nFor a very close friend 30th birthday, we bought him collectively a collector boxset of vinyls from his favorite band, quite expensive for us. Everyone gave what they could/wanted, his parents completed. Some people came with personal gifts instead, some came with gift even though they had participated, some probably did not participate but weren't singled out.\nUpon opening it, he was overjoyed and thanked everyone profusely. But at the end of the night, he did come to the person who had suggested the idea of the gift to ask if it was their idea, because they were the one with which he spoke of music most. He had guessed right, and gave them a long hug. He got super happy, nobody got overshadowed or hurt, the right person still got \"credit\" for the idea, and all was well.", "You think this is a wholesome take but it's really just tone deaf and immature.", "I\u2019m falling on a soft YTA here. I was going to say N A H, as it\u2019s a wonderful thing to spoil your best friend, and his gf is also reasonable to feel like you outshined her. \n\nHowever, you could have dealt with it slightly differently IMHO. For example, though it\u2019s nowhere near the same degree of expensiveness, I recently came across as antique book a friend of mine would have loved. His birthday was coming up, so I messaged his wife to show her it in the book shop, and asked her if she would like me to get it from her, or if not, if she thought he would be happy to receive it from me? She said wow that would be perfect for him, good find, but actually she got him a very similar one for his birthday last year, so thank you but no thank you. Which was absolutely fine with me. \n\nIf you had found the watch by \u201cfate\u201d, it would\u2019ve been respectful to send his girlfriend a message and say \u201cwow I\u2019ve just found this watch Tom said he\u2019s always wanted, just wanted to check in case you or his family had already planned to get it before I do?\u201d.

Asking to go last too was a bit selfish, if you didn\u2019t want to outshine the other gifts you could\u2019ve just said \u201cI\u2019ll give you mine separately\u201d. \n\nI think the gift was lovely and well intentioned but there is a certain social etiquette when interacting with a friend in a committed relationship that you just didn\u2019t consider.

She admits Tom has been in \"the friend zone\" with her for years. He's been dating the girlfriend for two years. It's clear that OP and friend group are wealthy and the girlfriend is not.

The girlfriend was right to be pissed off.\n\nI think everyone else is being too nice here. YTA. If one of my partner's female friends bought him a \u00a32,500 watch and got him to open it last, I'd be hella suspicious. If you and some friends had put in together for it as a group gift, that I could understand. Are you regularly in the habit of spending this much on close friends?

I can understand why his girlfriend is annoyed.", "YTA\n \nThat whole asking him to save your lavish gift for last in front of an actual *audience* thing was the part that makes you TA. Of course his girlfriend felt slighted by that. It was tactless and braggadocious - *you do very well financially*, so obviously you just HAD to make sure everyone there knew it, too. Hope the Grand Finale you staged for yourself stroked your ego enough. What are you getting him next year, a BMW?", "YTA. Pretend your were a man and he was a woman. Make it a diamond necklace.

By giving such an expensive gift and asking for it to specifically be opened last, I think you kind of made your friend's birthday all about you and your showing off.

Regardless of your intentions, the impact comes across as selfish.", "Afraid, yes; right over the top. \n\nLike wearing something at a wedding to outshine the bride?", "YTA, not so much for the gift itself but for telling him to save it for last. You knew how much it meant to him and how he would most likely react. Of course other people are going to feel sad/inadequate that they can't afford to get him similar luxuaries. As much as it shouldn't matter, I think you should have given him the gift after the party. \n\nAlso, given he's a watch fanatic and very vocal about that particular watch, it wouldn't be surprising if his girlfriend was saving to buy him one so I feel it would have just been common courtesy to ask her if she was saving for one or if it would be okay for you to get it for him. That could potentially be a once in a lifetime type gift she had planned for their wedding or something that now wouldn't be a meaningful.", "YTA, because a watch is a gift usually given by a significant other or spouse or family.

Especially his poor girlfriend, who would have spent hours crocheting the sweater and quite a lot of money purchasing the yarn for it. But I'm sure you were aware of that, which is why you asked for yours to be saved for last, so it could be the star of the show.\n\nI understand you wanted to make Tom happy, but you didn't have to do it so frivolously. It's no wonder it upset his girlfriend to see him react so much more positively to someone else's gift when she'd put so much love and effort into hers. I think her message was totally warranted.

That really does make you look like you're trying to outshine the other guests.", "YTA. And Tom is kind of an asshole too. \n\nI get that your intentions were pure, but giving someone a gift of that caliber leads into romantic territory. My husband and I are financially well off, but neither of us would get our friends a gift like that because it\u2019s almost too intimate. Add in the cost of it, and well\u2026 this is something that a partner or spouse should be gifting. Also instructing him to save it for last because he was opening gifts publicly and you knew your gift was cream of the crop just makes it seem like you liked the attention. If you were hellbent on gifting him this specific watch, you should have gifted it to him privately. \n\nTom also sucks too.

Read the fucking room, Tom. Not appropriate, reel it in. And he felt comfortable accepting a gift that expensive from a platonic friend?

What gives you the right to do that? It's so clear that you knew your gift would outshine the others and that you wanted attention and a big reaction from him. It's inappropriate because you're just a friend, and if I were the gf I'd be upset too.\n\nBut honestly, Tom is TA too.

OP, in the future, if you find yourself in a similar situation I see two ways that I would go about this having learned from your experience. 1, I would reach out to GF and say \"hey, I found this watch and it seems to be fate. I know Tom really wants it as I'm sure you're aware, let's go halfsies\" or something like that. If she's says she's saving up for it for Christmas then let her do this for him, right? No harm in finding another gift for your good friend for the sake of not stirring any drama. Option 2 is telling them that you'd like to give Tom the gift in private with both Tom and GF present. Maybe lighten any mood killers by saying that this counts as the next few birthday gifts or something and go smaller for the following years. This way he's not opening this expensive gift in front of everyone like that, GF doesn't have any reason to feel outshined in front of everyone. These are the ways I personally would choose to approach a situation like this having learned from OP's experience.

It would be awkward for all even if they were also thoughtful, appreciated gifts just due to difference in reaction.", "I have to disagree simply because of the way OP went about all of it. \n\nOP says she had no idea gf couldn't afford the watch, but in that scenario, doesn't make the common sense assumption that Tom would've told his girlfriend about it and that she would buy it for him. She doesn't even check with girlfriend to see if she may have already gotten the watch. That feels a little snaky. It's not like this is a $50 hoodie or something. It's a $2.5K watch. That's s big purchase to not consider the one other person that might also make that purchase. \n\nOP also makes it a point to outshine every other gift he received. Yes, the gift may have been worth seeing the joy on his face, but to know it will be his favorite present of the night and to still encourage him to open it last is a bit attention seeking and a bit \"I'm better than all of you\". \n\nIf it was really just about seeing his joy, she could've given it to him in private, but she made a specific effort to give it to him in a place where everyone would see how much better she is whether that better is how much more money she has or how much better she knows Tom or whatever else. \n\nThe best I can offer is n a h but in my heart of hearts, OP is TA.", "The projectionism here is strong\n\nOP crossed a boundary.

She does not get to make someone else responsible for managing those feelings. That is exactly what she's trying to do here. She feels insecure about either her financial status or about her place as Tom's girlfriend, or whatever. Those are her feelings to manage, or her feelings to communicate with HER BOYFRIEND. It is not OP's job to change their friendship with Tom to match What his girlfriend wants. That is up to Tom to implement certain boundaries if that's what he feels like doing.

It's nice Tom enjoys the present - if it were me I'd be super uncomfortable bc that is not a normal amount to spend on a friend for a birthday that isn't even a round number.\n\nI hope his girlfriend makes an uncomfortably personal hand made item for your boyfriend for his birthday.

Why? \n\nIt\u2019s his birthday it should be about celebrating him, I get wanting to get a nice gift for a friend especially when you can afford it and you know it would mean the world to them. The way you went about it tho is just so over the top and thoughtless. If you knew he wanted it so bad you should have consulted his GF, she\u2019s his partner and it would have helped build a relationship with her to just have the conversation.

If you really need to see his joy, you can hand it privately to him and see it yourself, without a group of people around you. But the gift itself is expensive and considered intimate in many cultures, so maybe get his girlfriend with you two to make sure she doesn\u2019t suspect anything. She might still feel upset since watch is such an intimate gift. Something like a laptop with the same value won\u2019t be seen the same as a watch.\n\nAlso I\u2019m a little confused since some comments say OP replied somewhere that this group of friends often give expensive gifts for example an European trip to the best friend of OP. So maybe this group of friends are at a higher financial status than the girlfriend. But if that\u2019s true, why is the best friend so excited over something that he can easily afford if he put some efforts into sourcing it? Or perhaps the best friend only has very rich friends but is not rich himself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: just saw someone quoted OP saying the girlfriend was the outsider, the only one in the friend group that didn't know about the watch gift...... wow that is just extra horrible.

I also knit and crochet and if I were in this situation I would start crying.", "Not to mention I have a hard time believing OP didn\u2019t know that kind of gift might be out of the GFs price range\u2026 books tend to be \u201cfairly\u201d cheap like almost always below $50. As someone who crochets, depending on type of yarn (acrylic vs real wools/type of wool) they can be done in a way that allows you to buy the yarn in increments. Ex. I\u2019m currently making my bf a sweater and because I know the yarn I\u2019m using doesn\u2019t have a noticeable colour variation between dye lots I have been buying it in smaller batches (this sweater takes about 12 balls of yarn at $6/ball) I started out with 5 balls, then another 3, about to purchase the last 4 this coming week. So less then $100 in materials all told, but much more time consuming then anything, but I am using a nice but bottom end priced yarn that is not hand dyed and is acrylic. Some skeins can be up to $50+ a piece if you\u2019re going with higher end hand dyed yarns (which generally need to be purchased all from the same dye lot to avoid colour variation). Either way the gift is a fairly long term time investment and people often under value such items thinking that the time invested is just \u201cfree\u201d. \n\nNot to mention if Tom is as close a friend as she claims she would have at least a passing idea of his/gf\u2019s financial situation just based on lifestyle and obviously the fact that if this watch was something he wanted so badly would he not have just bought one himself if he weren\u2019t in an obviously different income/financial bracket. \n\nOP is imo TA not for getting or wanting to give her friend this extravagant gift, but for being completely and utterly tone deaf about the whole situation. In my area $2500 is a months rent on a single bedroom apartment. She shouldn\u2019t have given the gift at the party, she definitely shouldn\u2019t have requested the place of honour of being the last gift, and she should\u2019ve given the the GF a heads up prior to birthday that she\u2019d found the watch. \n\nIt would also be interesting to know if this is a common theme with OP is she known for buying all her friends expensive gifts? Or is it just Tom? Why does Tom\u2019s committed partner not deserve a faux name and only referred to as the GF?

Kids birthday parties actually *don't* involve a public opening of presents. As a kid, we thanked the gifter (gifts are always given as soon as you enter the party) and put the present away in a discreet location (showing off a pile of gifts is *also* tacky, so they needed to be as invisible as feasible) - and did not touch them during the party. Only after everybody went home did we get to open presents. \n\nAs an adult, I have a small (6 people), close group of friends with whom I celebrate at midnight on my birthday. Usually only my best friend and her husband are physically present with me, others are on video (live out of state, or have other reasons that make attending a midnight party very inconvenient). I cut cake, while they sing happy birthday to me and then I open their gifts, which they had delivered to my home or gave me earlier, with strict instructions not to peek till midnight. And not one of those gifts is \"a card and a gift card\" (I have received hand-made cards though). All of us have similar rituals on our birthdays (not all of us do it at midnight though). For us, giving and opening birthday presents as an adult is a way to tell each other \"you are *family* \" - since in our culture adults typically get birthday gifts only from immediate family and you open presents only in front of immediate family. \n\nHowever, not one of us would ever dream of saying \"this is *the best* gift\". And all of us generally acknowledge how much thought went into the gift - for example, when one friend was broke and gave me a hand painted coke bottle as a gift, not only did *I* say how much I liked it (& I genuinely did, it's still displayed in my home, almost 10 years later), everybody else also said how much they appreciate hand made gifts (& they genuinely do).

The gf probably should not have reacted though, as it does make her look like *she is the only one allowed to make her bf happy* and that sounds not healthy.

Especially in an age group where $25 might still be a huge ask for a gift. \nGirlfriend called it right - don\u2019t gift for attention. Everybody else in that room felt awkward, not just the girlfriend. If it had been a parent that would have been different, but super big gifts and demanding to be last with a crowd of people watching isn\u2019t the socially best way to go about that kind of gift.", "I like to pay for some dinners or trips because I have no kids and a really good paying job and it\u2019s definitely not a power move. It\u2019s a \u201cI have more money than I know what to do with, let me treat my friends and family\u201d, is that a bad thing?", "Yea there\u2019s only 2 people in my life I would even consider spending that amount of money on, my wife and my mother due to the nature of those relationships.", "I don't believe for one minute this story is real. What \"friend,\" who is not extremely wealthy, buys a $2500 birthday gift?", "Me thinks she lied about not having feelings for Tom", "The position it was opened in doesn't really matter imo. It is such a huge gift that likely everything before and after were going to be overshadowed potentially. Best to make a private gift the day after or something.", "Plus I'm not buying that OP just \"happened\" to stumble into a random watch shop in NYC and they just \"happened\" to have this specific vintage watch that she decided to purchase on a whim for $2500 for her friend.", "That makes sense to me! I have friends that are doing super well financially and while I don\u2019t expect it by any means, I totally appreciate when they do things like that!", "We give gifts for the receiver\u2019s joy, but only one person actually got to do that at this party \u2014 OP. Everyone else got to see their gift get largely ignored.", "i think you have a point but of course what is the best friend gonna be talking about for a long time. The new watch he\u2019s been wanting for a long time. So if i went through the effort of picking out a gift i think he would really like them someone else got them a dream item completey overshadowing any effort i put in of course i\u2019m gonna be pissed and she asked for the watch to be open last too that\u2019s more then a bit sus to me", "This! In HS I was walking around the mall with a very good girl friend  of mine and we walked into Foot Locker and they had a pair of St John's reversible basketball shorts. As soon as I saw them I wanted them so badly but they were $40 and I had given my money to my parents to help pay rent. I said something to the extent of \"OMG I want these so badly but I can't afford $40 om shorts, I don't even spend that on jeans.\". It was a purely innocent comment with no intended manipulation or anything and my friend immediately snatched them out of my hand and through all my protesting and insistence that she doesn't buy them, she marched to the register and bought then for me. When I said she didn't have to do that she said \"That's the biggest smile I've seen on your face in a long time, who wouldn't pay $40 to see a friend this happy?\"", "YTA. Not for getting the gift, but for making sure it became the \"main event\" of the night, so to speak.\n\nIf it was really about making him happy, you could have done the opposite of what you did. Instead of making sure your gift is saved for last when you know it's gonna blow everyone else's out of the water, you should have pulled him aside either before the party or even after and given it to him then. And you still could have made his day, shared a beautiful moment with him, and not been an asshole to all of his other guests.\n\nHonestly, even if he was a single guy, it still would have been grossly out of touch at best, and an asshole move at worst. It's the reason holiday gift exchanges have a price limit, so people don't do this stuff to steal the show and everyone gets to enjoy it. But doing it when he has a partner there pushes this FIRMLY into asshole territory.", "YTA. you knew the present would outshine the Gf and your tone of I earn a lot and I do well financially while saying the GF essentially knitted a jumper for him suggests an I\u2019m the main character vibe off you.  While the gf was not in the right from her message I can see why she was pissed.", "YTA. That\u2019s a ton of money to drop on a friend without even consulting the girlfriend. I wouldn\u2019t even want my own family to spend that kind of money on me without talking to my SO about it first.", "YTA you broke the etiquette when it comes to gift giving. Which is don't get something that is league's above the other gifts (mainly in terms of price) unless you're the closest person to the gift receiver. You're not his gf, you're just a friend. If you still wanted to give it to him you should have done it in private and definitely not pull the whole \"save the best for last\" thing. \n\nImo this is not the type of gift you give to a friend when you're both in a relationship. It's inappropriate. Unless the typical price of the gifts was that expensive, which they were not. It seems like you're flaunting your wealth when you do something like this.", "YTA. Idk maybe not but, you seem a bit smug and as though youre searching for acceptance rather than understanding the situation. Its nice you can afford such lavish gifts, but if youre not his respective partner, I wouldnt have even given it to him in front of a bunch of people at all. I may have thought to involve the girlfriend and him when presenting it when theres less people around. Including her from the start may have eradicated any of your issues. Why dont you go ask the rest of the witness birthday guests how they feel about what they saw.", "If this was a rom com, you would definitely be the girl trying to win the guy over and away from the girl hes into currently with that gesture.\n\nI don't think I've ever seen a situation where someone outdid a couple by throwing a bunch of money at them with something and it not backfire in some way. Especially when the couple ( or the offended person ) does everything lowkey and personal instead ( like handmade sweaters).\n\nThat's always a point of contention in relationships, the money dicotomy, like having the rich brother and his family showing up at Christmas and all the kids getting expensive presents or outings. It might not be intentional, but it's felt by everyone. \n\nThere's no way not to be compared to at that point, it's why people agree to a limit in how much can be spent on gifts.\n\nYTA, even if you thought you were doing your best friend a solid, you inadvertently caused a rift in all your relationship, publically too.", "This is a no-brainer YTA. Buying a $2500 gift for a party where judging from the gf\u2019s gift the average budget was around $50-100 bucks\u2026..reallyyy??? Also asking for it to be opened last because its so special\u2026.cmon now. It just demonstrates a complete lack of social awareness and etiquette. \n\nThe only thing that could excuse your behavior is if you\u2019re so loaded that you have completely lost sense of how much 2500 bucks is. But seeing how aware you were of the grand nature of the gift I dont think thats the case.\n\nAlso Tom is also the AH here. What an inconsiderate idiot.", "My heart aches so much for Tom\u2019s girlfriend. Imagine spending hours crafting a sweater for your boyfriend, all handmade with your love and labor. And then you watch him receive this ridiculously expensive watch, jump in glee, hug a female friend tight, and declare to everyone that it\u2019s the \u201cbest birthday gift\u201d he\u2019s ever received. And you\u2019re just there watching, in the sidelines.\n\nThat has to be a sick punch in the gut.\n\nYTA, OP.", "It sounds like these 2 \u201cfriends\u201d just want to fuck each other.", "This sounds like a sweater curse case. There is a tradition? curse? legend? In the knitting and crochet community that you don't make something like that for a bf/gf because it leads to breakups. Generally smaller easy items like hats and scarves are safe, but sweaters, nope.", "What a perfect example", "Completely agree, this is one of the most reasonable responses. Too many responses are wildly speculative about an insecure gf, 'pick me' OP, etc\n\nBoiling it all down, it was the request to have her gift be the star of the show that makes OP the AH.", "Lol top 10%?! Still not even close. My wife and I make $350k between the two of us and we don't give $2500 gifts to old friends.\n\nFor the most parts gifts should be an amount that the recipient can reciprocate without problem. There is a level of wealth where it's reasonable that the friend would not feel the need to reciprocate - I have one family friend with net worth ~$50M and I don't try to return equivalent gifts to him. He mostly brings high end consumables every time we visit though. Never durable goods that cost thousands.", "Yeah Icl if your bf is calm with it then what\u2019s her problem ? I think the plain truth is you made your friend happier than she made her bf and her first gut reaction was jealousy. Unless there\u2019s something weird going on between the two of you (which I don\u2019t think is the case since your bf is on Board and backing you up) then she needs to regulate and step up. She bought her man a sweater and book for his 25th and she\u2019s reeling from being out gifted which is immature", "Insecurities?  That line about happiness is only shared between her and Tom is a huge red flag.  This goes beyond insecurities.  Holy shit...\n\nBut yes, on topic, nta.", "Wouldn\u2019t you be insecure if you spent hours knitting something for your SO and their rich friend got them an expensive gift and your SO said it was the best gift of the night? Jesus Christ you people are incapable of thinking of anyone else\u2019s perspective other than the OP", "Everyone who is voting NTA needs to read your comment", "OP might be in a high paying role at a hedge fund, private equity, or fintech where they pay a lot but yeah even making 6 figures, $2.5k is a lot to shell out for a gift", "she already has a few alts in here calling ppl jealous lmao the most obvious is username utahutopia", "She even had him save it for last! How much more of a \"look at me\" do you need?", "That plus coming from a family background of wealth would probably put someone in a good place to throw away the occasional 2.5k. If you're making $400k+ and never really had to worry about retirement anyhow, it's monopoly money at some point.", "It's normal for parents to buy you shit, it's weird for friends to be buying each other shit. No adult I know gets gifts from other adults at our age, birthday parties are usually just an excuse to hangout and have a good time.", "That would've been the really classy move. Even if OP could afford it alone, still ask the GF and other good friends to chip in so it's from everyone.", "Thank you. Who suddenly decided that you should consult with everyone going to a party about how much they are going to spend on a present? If your bf has someone who can and will spend a lot of money on a present for them, be happy for them. NTA at all.", "Cheers!", "Watch OP become single when Tom does.", "In a few cultures watches are considered a romantic gift.", "Exactly. This should\u2019ve been done privately. Agree that asking to save it for the end because it\u2019s oh so special and making it an even bigger deal/moment is where OP really screwed up.", "I hope she would spend that much on her own bf too. Spoiling another girl\u2019s man while you have your own is kinda gross.", "I'm relieved to hear your take on the public gift opening. I have always despised doing it, it makes me sooo uncomfortable. I've done it only at the behest of family/hosts. For example when my MIL threw me a baby shower she made me do this, on basically a stage in the backyard. I HATED it lol. But felt ungrateful saying no, because gift givers want the joy of seeing your receive what they picked for you! Ugh. \n\nWhenever I throw parties I try to make them amazing as far as food, experience, and drinks go ESP when gifts are being brought. So it feels like the guests are getting something back.", "Gifts are probably optional. I doubt Tom was saying that people had to bring him gifts to attend, and frankly, the majority of people enjoy watching the recipient of their gift open their gift, which is what I\u2019d wager is why Tom does his gift opening thing.", "Okay good, thanks! That makes me feel better. Really thought I was crossing boundaries and acting like an asshole without knowing it \ud83d\ude05", "Yeah I don't think any of the NTA responses are thinking of how they would feel if they were the GF in this situation. It's massive faux pas what OP has done here and anyone who can't see that is likely quite immature", "I also highly doubt OPs boyfriend said the GF was insecure and just shrugged it off cause she just outed Tom's his replacement....", "This. Privately and given by both her and her boyfriend", "pretty sure op is going around with alts accounts", "Also I feel if you polled the table a non-zero number of people would assume that OP has feelings for the boyfriend based on the extravagance of the gift. Sure that may not be her intention (and I sort of have a hard time believing it myself) but it's clearly the impression that at least the girlfriend got, if not others.", "I was kinda thinking that but maybe she did that because if he opened it first, everyone else WOULD be like, dang, my gift is worthless. Like he'll be showing real joy at all those gifts and people won't be thinking he faked it. Realistically, she should have gifted that when it was just the two couples and not all the friends.", "The fact that she asked for the present to be opened last indicates knowledge that the gf in fact wouldn't have been able to buy the watch. If there was a chance that her gift was going to be outshone, she wouldn't have asked for it to go last. She knew with certainty that hers was the 'best'.", "Also OP obviously would know the gf couldn\u2019t afford the watch. It\u2019s a party with a bunch of 25 year olds, you know what jobs they work, and that\u2019s like 50x more than would be appropriate for any gift at a party like that. Tom had been talking about the watch, op got it without the slightest worry gf was gonna get it too but \u201cshe had no idea\u201d. Yeah bs. How do you have no idea 99% of 25 year olds can\u2019t drop 2500 on a birthday present to a friend and simultaneously ask to go last because you know your gift will massively outshine everyone else\u2019s. \n\nSeriously does most of this sub just not have any real human interaction? Getting a $2500 gift for a birthday party with a bunch of 25 year olds is already ridiculous, giving it when he has a gf and after she gives her gift when you know it\u2019s something she could never live up to is a huge asshole move. I seriously can\u2019t believe people are calling the gf the asshole, she planned and threw the whole party, gave a gift she would have worked hard on and spent time on, and op made it so the only memory of the party will be her getting the wildly over the top expensive gift. Why would anyone want to invite op to another event like this when they\u2019ll just show up and make it all about them by throwing massive amounts of money around. \n\nThe gf wasn\u2019t even an asshole in the text when she had a right to be kinda mad, she was perfectly reasonable in showing she was uncomfortable. If a guy was friends with a girl in a relationship and got her a $2500 piece of jewelry at a birthday party every answer here would be calling them the asshole.", "That part honestly made me feel so uncomfortable. The OP and this \"friend\" clearly have some emotional issue going and I wouldn't be wholly surprised if it turns into cheating shaped issues in the future. Am I exaggerating and making it into something way bigger than it is? No I don't think so", "I agree with both of these.  If there\u2019s a gift I think is going to be particularly distracting for my kids, I give it last so they can give attention to everything else first.  But really it is a ridiculous outlier.  We\u2019re pretty well off and I still can\u2019t imagine buying ANYONE a $2500 gift.", "I feel like even making 6 figures, that\u2019s such a huge mental/emotional hurdle to need to jump to spend that much money all at once! Like it feels like it\u2019s either some pathological need to be liked the best or something or there\u2019s a LOT more wealth than just a 6 figure salary backing up this decision", "\u201cOP should have told gf to go last and should have made a huge deal about the homemade gift.\u201d Just imagining the dumbass face of shock they\u2019d put on as they pretend to be amazed makes me cringe so hard. Idk if you know this cus this might just be a chick thing, but being fake is very obvious. The person that dropped 2G\u2019s on a watch popping off over a sweater is an irony everyone would feel immediately.\n\n\nOP 100% imo needed to give the gift separately. It\u2019s literally as if she bought him a car and instead of the money and practically of that she threw it into a watch which is a complete pleasantry. The only way I can excuse that sort of behavior is if you\u2019re so rich you\u2019ve become socially clueless about how much money means to people. Although it wasn\u2019t wrong of giving the gift to OP, let rich friends do rich friend things if they feel like it, but don\u2019t make OP\u2019s dreams come true in front of his girlfriend if you can help it.", "Agreed entirely, if you\u2019re in your twenties and you can spend 2500 on a gift for a friend and do not realize that is outrageous wealth flaunting you are either a dimwit or an asshole.", "Tbh this was my first thought. OP is the AH", "Ok yes - thank you for acknowledging the mental hump that someone has to get over in order to spend that much money. While maybe for someone making 6 figures it might be technically doable, spending more than a month\u2019s rent on a birthday present seems completely unhinged without some other explanation bolstering confidence (like familial wealth and long term safety)", "I don\u2019t think the woman being married would really have changed this all that much for me", "YTA, but Doing it in private would be far more intimate and innappropriate. This level of gift giving is for family and romantic partners. Female friends have a huge problem with constantly claiming territory over their male friends. He isnt yours. Stop it.", "I was actually thinking the entire time I read the post that this sounds like a fictional story someone made up as a \u201cgender-swapped\u201d version of that story that just so happens to amp up some details and try to head off shit everyone said in that thread.", "If anyone is the AH is Tom by saying that. The girlfriend is probably hurt by that words and his reaction more than the present itself.", "Yeah... OP told reddit how much the watch cost without needing to, and then told her friend to open hers last. There's just no justification to make it a spectacle. She assumed NO ONE ELSE got a \"special\" gift, so opening hers last puts all the shine on hers.", "Alright let\u2019s try an alternative, OP asks for the gift to be opened in private to avoid stealing the show.. would that not be a more intimate setting and lead to an even worse reaction?? You really going to pass up on a lucky find for a friends birthday that fits in your budget for\u2026 what reason?? \n\nIF GIVING PRESENTS WASN\u2019T ABOUT OUTDOING EACH OTHER WHY WOULD WE BOTHER WITH FANCY WRAPPING PAPER AND THE WHOLE HEY EVERYONE WATCH ME OPEN ALL THESE THINGS ONE AT A TIME?!?! \n\nKinda sounds like a good friend", "OP and her boyfriend could have given it privately as a joint gift and that solves the problem.", "Man, I've never received such a thoughtful gift from anyone else other than my parents. I'm the one usually (before pandemic started) making art, craft or DIY gifts for close friends, parents, exes (I know!)but never been at the receiving end. I wish to feel that earnestly and going by OP's post, if Tom didn't receive his gf's gift nicely or didn't voice his gratitude and love for it, fuck him!!! I've been in such situations and it honestly sucks when your SO doesn't appreciate such gestures, much less return it in kind.", "Yes. And an adult angling for an expensive gift is tacky.", "Omg so true, if it\u2019s vintage, I don\u2019t believe that you can just happen to see it while window shopping, and also recognize it.", ">flex\n\nThis is the heart of it.

Making her TAH.", "Opening gifts in front of people is one of my least favorite things to do in the world. It\u2019s funny because I am just as likely to jump over people to give someone a big hug for a handmade sweater because the time investment would make me feel all warm and fuzzy but I\u2019m always so worried about not reacting correctly and hurting someone\u2019s feelings because my poker face sucks", "Well said. It was also kind of rude of him to call it the best present ever, when his girlfriend probably spent at least dozens of hrs making him a handmade sweater too. He should appreciate her craftsmanship as well as that if the watches.

Different strokes but this would be very gauche in my circle.", "I see where you\u2019re coming from. It\u2019s a complex situation.
