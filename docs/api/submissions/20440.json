We're in our mid 20's now and are both currently in committed relationships with long term partners. I have never had feelings for Tom nor has he ever had feelings for me.\n\nSince college, Tom has been a huge watch fanatic. Two months ago, he was showing me this stunning vintage watch and made an off-handed comment about how he would die of joy if he somehow got his hands on one.\n\nVery coincidentally, I was in NYC a few weeks ago and stumbled upon this watch store that just so happened to have the exact one Tom wanted. It was expensive, I wont lie, at about $2,500, but I decided to get it for his 25th birthday (to me, it was basically fate lol). My boyfriend and I do very well financially so this was something that I could personally afford and wanted to buy for Tom, especially knowing how happy it'd make him.\n\nTom has a tradition of hosting a dinner party at his place for his birthday and then following that up with cake and gift opening. I told him before the dinner that my gift was a huge surprise and asked if he could save it for last and he agreed. His girlfriend ends up going first and she gets him this gorgeous sweater that she crocheted for him and a book that he's been wanting, which I thought was super thoughtful and lovely. Last, it was my gift. When he opened it and saw what it was he literally screamed, hopped over a bunch of people, and squeezed me in this huge bear hug. I was SO happy to see him happy, it genuinely filled me with so much joy. He even got emotional and I saw him swipe a few tears. He also said that it was the \"best gift he'd ever received.\" The whole time, his girlfriend was only slightly smiling and stayed quiet.\n\nThe next morning, I get a text from his girlfriend that essentially said that although she appreciated my thoughtful gift, she thought that it was a bit out of touch and lacking awareness. She admitted that Tom had also told her about the watch and she wanted to get it for him, but it was way out of her budget. She accused me of knowing this (I had NO idea) and still getting it to rub it in her face and to \"outshine\" her. She finished by saying how she felt like I had overstepped a boundary by getting the gift and would appreciate me not doing anything similar to it again in the future. I responded and told her that while I could see her POV, I was just trying to do a nice thing for a close friend of mine. I asked her, wouldn't you rather he gotten the gift and seen the happiness that it brought him than him not getting it at all? She responded that that happiness was \"only shared between \\[me\\] and Tom\" and no one else and that she felt hurt by my actions.\n\nOnly my boyfriend knows about this and he's on my side. But thinking through it all again, I do see how I could've overstepped, but my boyfriend says that it's not my job to apologize for her insecurities.

Gift giving is my love language and I'm all for thoughtful gifts, but it feels like the OP isn't being completely honest. I don't think she's stupid, so things aren't adding up.

You knew it would be a better gift than everyone else and you wanted to get all the credit for it (bc why would you give that expensive of a present in front of a large group?). The decisions here were not completely selfless IMO. Why wouldn\u2019t you ask friends to chip in for it with you so it would be a group gift that he loves from everyone (this would be the more selfless option). Or ask his gf to chip in? And it\u2019s a gift from the two of you. \n\nAlso if he has this party every year, then you should probably already know the vibe of what type of gifts he gets (and how much the gifts are).

Should have been done in private if you wanted it to only be from you.", "NTA Sounds like she was insecure at first and then got upset after stewing on it for a night. \n\nI think it\u2019s valid for her to be a bit upset that he was more excited for your gift than for hers. It was objectively a cooler gift but that doesn\u2019t mean it meant more to him or that you purposely upstaged her. She\u2019s clearly projecting a lot of issues onto you. I think they probably had a conversation at some point where she mentioned she couldn\u2019t afford it for him and that\u2019s what really set her off, that you were able to.\n\nAnd that part about you not being \u201cpart of their happiness\u201d is **ultra cringe**,I don\u2019t know how else to say it. Very insecure and I doubt your close friend feels the same way.", "ESH. Making him save the gift for last was very attention seeking this isn\u2019t about you.", "YTA\n\nThat was a completely innapropriate gift to give a friend. It is far too expensive and far too intimate.\n\nHe will never be able to reciprocate and now your friendship is tainted by the burden of him needing to be grateful and being unable to put the relationship back in equal footing. \n\nThis was also disrespectful to your respective relationships. You know you have no feelings for Tom, and your boyfriend knows that too (hopefully), but every single other person invited to that dinner is going to think otherwise because of this gift and Tom's reaction to it. Same for all of the Reddit strangers who read this. The appearance of something can be just as or even more damning than the actual existence of it, and I have zero doubt you've just brought some nasty rumors and suspicions about your relationship with Tom to life.\n\nThis gift is furtherly innapropriate since it may wreck your friendship with him. His girlfriend is now very, very uncomfortable, thinking she has to be in competition with you. Especially since Tom just publicly declared you the winner in front of all your friends. You know him better than she does, you know him more intimately than she does, you can give him stuff she can't. She is going to want Tom to put in some distance so she can have assurance he doesn't have romantic feelings for you, and so she can put their bond on the fast track to gaining what it lacks without being poisoned by comparisons. He is either going to have to to keep her, damaging his relationship with you, or he's going to have to dump her, which will likely cause him to resent you.\n\nYou really should have thought before you got him something so extravagant, and then changed your mind to something else.", "NTA- though I can\u2019t imagine dropping that much on a friend, ever. I don\u2019t think you had bad intentions, and your partner was on board with it. It\u2019s understandable that she feels outshined- she was- but it wasn\u2019t the purpose of you giving the gift. Her comment that the happiness was only between you two struck me as odd as well. Putting myself into her shoes, I feel like I would be happy my bf got something he wanted so badly, even if it wasn\u2019t from me.", "NTA. Absolutely cool bf btw", "NTA.\nI think it was a very nice present.\nHope the girlfriend gets over it.\nIf not.... your friend still has a really good friend and watch.", "Info: How long has Tom been in this relationship?

I hate this idea  that the partners as to be the one that gives the best gift.  I always get happy when my partner get something he wants from some one else.   Why?  Well then I dont have to buy that  and  can focus  on spoiling him on other days and also I get happy seeing him happy.\n\nIf she is so insecure about her and the  relationship  , then the relationship wont last, if she cant share in Toms happiness then she will  build walls and not bridges.\n\nAlso yes giving the gift last was great idea, because he wouldnt have cared about the other  gifts in worse cases and then she would be even more angry.  \n\n\nIf you are going to apologize to her, do it in front of her AND  Tom and say I am sorry I hurt your feeling  with the gift I gave Tom, next time I ask you before giving Tom anything.", "You should have given him the gift privately.

I just saw the watch, became super excited at the coincidence, and was like \"I HAVE to get this for him!\" I definitely could have thought about splitting it between a few people or asking her ahead of time, but it wasn't even a thought in my head due to how excited I was just at the opportunity (plus I was in a rush and leaving NYC that evening so if I didn't get it then, I'd have to go back for it). \n\nI give gifts based on what people want, not the price point.

We're all very friendly and have hung out multiple times, but none of us are that close with her.", "Has anyone considered that it might\u2019ve actually been good that he opened it last? If he opened it in the middle, imagine the pressure of the person who\u2019s up next with their gift. I don\u2019t see the big issue with having a special present go last because no one has to follow it up", "I disagree with you. She was considerate asking it to be the last, because no gift after that would have mattered anymore. If it was the first, all the other gifts would have lost meaning. This way he still enjoyed all the other gifts, and her gift wasn't ruining the gift opening ceremony.", "Well, you'll be happy to know that no one praised me lol. Everyone was just happy to see him happy. They all cheered and clapped, just like after every gift he opened. We have a really supportive friend group, no one's out here specifically showering me with praises to make me and only me look good.", "Yes? I don't see how that's a problem? I couldn't have predicted how he'd react but I was happy to see him happy!", "A huge deal? \nThe whole set up of this immaturity stew is a deal ma\u2019am", "Read my comment again, i mentioned regarding private thing only.

I know down comment you stated you didn\u2019t even know the GF was aware of his desire for said watch, hear me out on this \u2026.. why would you assume she doesn\u2019t know? What other between you & him things are there exactly?

If this was done to me I would not have been happy. It\u2019s just attention grabby.

No one told me if she knew.\n\nAll I said was people cheered and clapped after he opened my gift....just like they did after he opened every gift. No one specifically went out of their way to praise me with words.", "...I don't see the problem with his reaction. I'm not sure I understand your comment. Are you upset at him for reacting so positively or me for making him react so positively? I'm lost.", "Yes Karma finds a way so hopefully someone will make her as happy as she made her friend happy. Stop feeling bitter about people's happiness and wishing them bad..", "Yeah...\ud83d\ude33 I'm not sure why she's SO upset\n\nNot sure why I'm being completely demonized by her for just valuing his happiness either...", "He's not the type of person to go around yelling \"LOOK AT MY $2,500 WATCH\".

The way you keep on defending her in every comment is astounding me.", "I think sweetselene is the girlfriend!", "Because you wanted to be the star of the show .

It was never a stable relationship if something as simple as a gift is enough to create ripples in it.

He should have warned her that his girlfriend is sensitive to things like that. \n\nThis is of course unless there is any history of his girlfriend being uncertain of the relationship between OP and her friend (which; would still not be on OP, but then she should have been more careful). \n\nPeople need to think about if they perceive gift giving as a ritual meant primarily for the receiver or the giver. He loved the gift, and there should be no need to downscale it to protect other peoples ego as we are not talking about young children being bought with gifts here. The value of a gift should not be measured in the cost anyway, it is about finding something special for that person. And it sounds like the girlfriend gave a super nice one too, it just was not as unexpected. \n\nThe dopamin high he must have gotton from the watch gift is insaaane. And from an event perspective it totally makes sense to save it for last. Now the others got to enjoy his happy face without having to measure it up against the big one. \n\nAlso: it does not sound like OP does this as a rule. I too give mye friends gifts I want to give them, and dont follow rules for what it has to cost. Sometimes they are homemade, sometimes cheap and sometimes expensive.  It's more about finding something that the receiver will love.", "NTA, She's bitter because she couldn't get it for him.\nIt's hard because I'm similar, when it was our 10 year wedding anniversary I booked a couple of nights away not to far or expensive, it was what I could afford.\nMy brother has booked 5 nights in an exotic place for his 10 year and they've been talking about how great its going to be, it's not to rub it in our faces their just excited, but it made me feel shitty due to jealousy", "NTA, but its tacky as hell to open presents with everyone around like a competition.", "NTA.

You wanted not just to bask in his reaction , you wanted an audience to this declaration of your greatness.", "I think yes, you are a bit TA, especially since you specifically wanted it to be opened last because they assumed their gift would be the best. That hubris alone icks me out. But honestly, the birthday boy is the biggest AH here as he said that it was the *nest* gift he's ever received, in front of his girlfriend who gave him a handmade gift. And who knows how many other gifts she's given him.", "NTA I'm pretty sure she wouldn't have reacted this way if the gift was from a guy friend.", "NTA. You\u2019re in a secure relationship with your partner and this is a long-time friend whom you share a close bond with.

It sucks not being able to provide the people you love with things that mean something to them, especially when you know how seen and loved that would make them feel. But she should have discussed that with him, and not you. It\u2019s not about the money.

SAVE TOM! SAVE TOM!", "NTAi don't understand why people get so upset over who gives whom what present. Unless it's something genuinely innappropriate, why can't people just be happy that their loved one got something they wanted??\n\nLike, if someone got my partner some equivalent of this, I'd probably just think either \"Damn I wish I'd thought of that\" or \" Oh shit that's generous!\"", "OR she could be happy for her bf.

Mostly bc they don\u2019t exist.  But yeah. Seems like your intentions were pure and the gf is a ball of jealous/frustrated/disappointed, which is 45% understandable. Hopefully she can see you had good intentions and her bf\u2019s joy and y\u2019all can move on.  Buuuut I do think you are going to have to get your BF a very nice present this year lol", "Imma go with esh cause I understand her point of view and so should you how would you feel if someone got your bf a gift like that? But also her text to you was uncalled for. I think you her and Tom need to sit down and see what boundaries need to be put in place and also will give everyone the time to talk it out and have an ADULT conversation about it! No talking over each other n all that just give your sides and feelings and talk it out!", "I feel like the people who are saying NTA are mostly looking at it through whether OP was trying to make a romantic move on her friend or not. I think it's clear that it was meant solely as a platonic gesture. But that doesn't absolve her from the accusation of acting inappropriately/TA. \n\n\nIt seems that for whatever reason (out of budget, wrong time, whatever) the $2500 vintage watch wasn't an immediate expenditure OP's friend was willing to make at that time. And the way it works with gifts is that when we receive something that we  *really* want or that is *rly* special from someone, we see it as proof that that individual cares very deeply about us. But the complication arises here bc since the gift was so expensive it's not just a matter of who's willing to put in the effort. It's a matter of who has the means to give it. His gf, unfortunately did not. By you giving the gift instead, you made it seem as though you were most willing. You were not. You just had the privilege to make it happen. \n\nWhich is great but the reason your friend asked his *gf* for that gift is bc for most people the most important person in their life is their SO: that's who they care about the most and who cares about them the most. I mean if your friend knows you can afford such items (assuming he knows you have a high salary) then he could have asked you for the gift. But he didn't. Bc it's *inappropriate* to ask for something so intimate from a friend. And thats what a meaningful AND out of budget gift is - a demonstration of intimacy (intimacy meaning closeness. In this situation its clearly not romantic). That's not a role a friend plays in ones life, ESP if they have a SO. \n\nAnd you kind of said it best yourself. On one hand in your comments you said you weren't trying to get praise from your friends and that no one applauded you or anything. But on the other hand you said they weren't aware or how expensive it was. if your friends knew the value (both monetary and sentimental) the watch had for your friend, I think it's very likely they would have felt slighted as well. Because his gf said it best:  giving the most desired gift is a happiness and intimacy between *just* you and your friend. \n\nI know you were just trying to do something nice for your friend but the way you went about it just wasnt the best. I feel like you could have reached out to his gf regarding the watch, telling her you were interested in buying it for him and asking her if she wanted to split the cost or something like that. \n\nI do feel like you're soft YTA for your oversight bc you had good intentions and didn't know as much about the situation as you do now. But i think youre a massive YTA for the way you invalidated her emotions when you responded to his gf and for doubling down in the comments.", "Hmmm you\u2019re one of \u201cthose\u201d people.

N T A for getting the gift but YTA for how you gave it. Do you realise that jumper probably took the girlfriend more than a month to make and you completely took away the significance of that?\n\nPersonally I\u2019d appreciate a gift more if someone spent weeks making it rather than money on it. Time is the most precious gift you can give someone.", "Yta, you shouldve texted the gf and gone in on it with her", "Asking him open it last shows you knew it would outshine everyone. \n\nIf it was me I would have given a big gift like that privately", "Soft YTA. You were well-intentioned, but making a show out of it was a bit weird for, I think, everyone. Personally, I am super into making gifts. I love it. I take pride in taking the time to find the perfect gift for each person I love, for me it is a way to show that I care and I listen to them, and I know them well and can pick something specific for them. So I absolutely get that sometimes you find That Perfect Thing, and even if it is awkwardly expensive, you still have to. But what I personally do when that happens is either give it privately to the person before the event if an event ks planned, or text at least a few more people and make it into a group gift so that no one is excluded.\n\n\nEDIT: upon reading that the price is not wild for your friend group, I think maybe you accidentally stepped into a sensitive topic for the girlfriend. It clearly must be outside of their budget, or your friend would have got the watch for himself. One has to be careful with money issues when it comes to those who are not close enough for us to know about their money situation. I would say you were more accidentally privileged than intentionally AH.", "YTA - if i knew his birthday was coming up and i knew gift was expensive(even after you bought it)  i would hit up some of people attending and try to split cost between them to get him his dream watch. If they didnt want to, just give it but otherwise you could make it group gift since its cost is way over whats usually birthday budget gift imo.", "NTA. She's insecure as fuck. She's acting like a possessive psycho. It's a watch, not a BJ.\n\nEdit OP says GF said happiness is only shared between the GF and the friend. Wtf?", "Unless you all are millionaires and make a habit of spending that much on each other YTA. You could have given that to him privately.

(We are both women who have had serious relationships with men in the past, so, kind of it doesn't matter if it came from a man or woman)", "All I can see in this story is Tom fishing for a very expensive watch in the lead up to his birthday. Nice work Tom! \n\nIt\u2019s strange to me, too, that his girlfriend would give him such meaningful and personal gifts in front of everyone, rather than in private. Maybe it\u2019s done differently where you are\u2026", "NTA. As long as you could you could easily afford this gift", "YTA.

But I would be so happy to see someone I love get something that made them so happy.", " Soft YTA Seems like you did want to be the center of attention by telling him to wait for last. A $2500 watch is a HUGE gift. You really didn\u2019t know that the gf could not have afforded such a gift? \n\nYou really made sure that you got all the accolades that night. I think you need to re-examine your motives here, and maybe ask yourself why it was so important that you one-upped his girlfriend.", "NTA Honestly, imo, I don't think how much you spent was really the problem for her. What she is really upset about is he didn't scream, hop over people, grab her up in a hug, get teary-eyed and thank HER for what SHE got him. Doesn't matter that he probably loved and appreciated what she gave him just as much. He didn't give her the high praise in front of everyone she felt she was due. So when he was justifiably surprised and overjoyed about your gift  and expressed it, she got her panties in a twist!! You owe her NOTHING!! What you did was incredibly sweet.

I understand you are close, but are you sure he told you about every birthday gift ever ? Besides, breaking a tradition to avoid hurting someone would have been completely understandable...\n- people know vintage watch are expensive, even if they don't know how much it actually cost, it would still be clear that it wasn't a cheap gift\n- you could have gotten the watch and still ask them to chip in afterwards if they wanted/were able to. You're framing it like asking them to chip in was something you would have had to have an answer for before buying the gift, but it's not the case. A simple text of \"hey folks, I've just found a super gift for Tom, would you like to make it a group gift ?\" would have sufficed and things would have been far less awkward for the girlfriend. \n\nSometimes we make honest mistakes that hurt people, it doesn't make us horrible people if we recognize it and apologize.

Like are you supposed to buy a $50 gift for the friend who just got you that? I actually have amounts I will spend according to relationship. I max out at $5-600.", "I would be so uncomfortable if a friend gave me this.", "Would you buy the child of a friend who had limited means a very expensive gift for their birthday or Christmas?", "When we got my best friend a PS5 we included all the group in on it even though any one of us could have afforded it alone. Then everyone did additional gifts on top of that. When they got me a new big present, it was from everyone too, when we get the next person a big gift, it\u2019ll be from everyone again. It\u2019s just us trying to be inclusive and thoughtful of the entire friend group.", "That\u2019s an awesome gift :) I feel the exact same way \u2026like I didn\u2019t really think etiquette, I was just thinking what would make my best friend happy \ud83d\ude2d", "I mean she\u2019s the only one who I didn\u2019t tell that I was gifting the watch AND who knew the price (independent of me). Not that I consider her an outsider to us!!", "Very interesting choice of word indeed.", "I would buy them ALL the things if I can afford it. I\u2019ll check with my friend first but if they were my friend they would not have a problem with it.", "I'm not biting my dude, if someone wants to get the group to chip in for a \"big gift\" it's on them to bring it up, e.g. OPs mates gf could've asked the group to chip money in towards the watch her bf reeeeally wanted. Nothing was said, OP made the right choice getting it imo.", "NTA. OP, your best bet is to stop responding to these comments. Some of people have nothing better to do and are going to pick apart your every word. \n\nTo me, it doesn\u2019t seems that you had any negative motives, just that you\u2019re well off financially and maybe a little out of touch with how big gifts like that make come across. \n\nMajority of the population doesn\u2019t even have $2500 to blow on themselves randomly much less a friend. So, no matter how innocent your intentions were, I think it\u2019s probably understandable the GF felt weird about it. It\u2019s also probably why others can\u2019t wrap their head around you buying a friend something expensive without ulterior motives. I would just reach out and tell her something like, \u201cHey i\u2019m sorry I made you feel that way. I didn\u2019t think about it being an issues, I was just excited I got lucky enough to find that watch and had the opportunity to buy it. I\u2019ll be mindful in the future. I hope we are all good.\u201d Hopefully, if she doesn\u2019t have any hard feelings after that, you all can just move on. Even though I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, sometimes it\u2019s better to just apologize when you\u2019ve upset a friend accidentally than to loose a friendship or have longstanding issues over something so small.", "And there it is. Outsider. And you told everyone but her."]}
