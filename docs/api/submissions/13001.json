This gift severely confused me and I am going to explain why. My whole life my dad has instilled in us how important it is to know of our background and our heritage. On my mom\u2019s side we come from a small Eastern European country; on my dad\u2019s side we have Italian and South American heritage. I feel we have embraced all these things; we have Italian passports, I speak Spanish fluently, and for 20 years I and my siblings attended a summer camp to learn about our Eastern European roots. I feel very fortunate to have embraced every part of my heritage, hence my confusion for why we were given the tests. Maybe if one of us had been adopted or if we all had different parents then I\u2019d understand but that is not the case. Everyone in my family has taken the test and I haven\u2019t. I don\u2019t see a point. We all share the same DNA, it\u2019s gonna be the same results. I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re all acting surprised about their results, when it\u2019s nothing we haven\u2019t already known. My dad won\u2019t quit. He keeps saying that I need to take the test to further prove our ancestry. I also forgot to mention that my whole life I\u2019ve checked off \u201cLatina/Hispanic\u201d whenever it comes to filling out forms about your background. So again I don\u2019t understand. My dad is now saying that he has shown results of Native/Indigenous (forgive me if I don\u2019t use the proper word) blood and wants us (the kids) to take the test to get some sort of credit/proof of being Native. I keep saying \u201cwell if we are your kids, I don\u2019t see a point in taking the test\u201d. My dad is adamant that I take the test when I\u2019ve made it explicitly clear that I don\u2019t want to. My brothers also think I am being stubborn for not wanting to do it. But as I\u2019ve stated, we all have the same parents. I don\u2019t wanna take the test. I know my background. I do feel bad because I know these tests ain\u2019t cheap, and my dad went and spent money on them. But the fact he keeps guilting me to take the test because of the money I also feel is unfair. My dad taught me that it\u2019s important to know where you come from and embrace your roots, and I feel I most certainly have. So am I the asshole for not wanting to take this DNA test?", "created_utc": 1679583346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zmv6a/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_a_dna_test/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The DNA proves nothing in court as far as native ancestry, so that's a bust.  Your siblings have taken the test so you have a good approximation of the results.  There is no good reason to pressure you to take a test that has no impact on your life just to please your dad.", "NTA I wouldn't willingly put my DNA in some database.", "NTA but you are wrong that you would be identical to your siblings. Our family is very different. I was also raised to think I was one ethnicity and have almost none in my DNA.

It should never be forced on anyone especially as we never know what those companies may do with those data.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to not give a private company your genetic material/information.

Despite coming out of the same womb within minutes of each other. So, sorry - but I don't really yrust those results. Tbf, that was years ago, they may have improved ...", "NTA. \n\nAlso did your father actually expand his Indigenous results? Asking because given the south American heritage on his side unless relatives were lying, thats the most likely source vs what I assume he thinks is North American Indigenous ancestry. \n\nThat said you guys would need far more than a 23andMe test to qualify for anything.", "NTA\nWhile paternity may be the issue I think he is seeing dollar signs. Since he is focused on his Native American heritage, I think he read something where if he proves he is related to a specific tribe he will, to put it crassly, be eligible for casino money.", "My sister and I come from the same parents but our dna tests had different components. We have been mistaken for twins that\u2019s how similar we look but for our dna tests I had more European features and have a large portion of Spaniard. She had more South American and norther European. Even with the same parents you can have more dna of one over the other. If it was a paternity test then yeah that would be a super weird gift and your consent would be need but It is your choice whether to take it or not since it would be similar to if he bought you a nice item to display but it doesn\u2019t fit every occasion or decor as far as guilting you with the cost.", "NTA. I haven't bothered taking the test because I have my late parents DNA and use those results for research. 2 of my 3 kids took the test for fun to compare with my parents. It's best to get elderly relatives tested ASAP.", "NTA. I like how he found out that he has Native blood\u2026 like, who do you think the Europeans slept with in South America? But, no, all the DNA is the same for all 3 kids so its pointless.", "Nta.   \n\nI'd  get one of my friends to do it.

Your genetic material and control over access to it is of course very personal to you. It\u2019s your choice. If he wants to explore any indigenous heritage more, he can do that on his own and doesn\u2019t need you to. I would sit him down and seriously ask him if there is any deeper reason behind this that he hasn\u2019t discussed yet can he let you know and if not can he please leave it as this isn\u2019t something you want to pursue?", "NTA, he gave you a gift.  After someone gives you a gift to do as you see fit with it.  You didn't ask for it, and it's not your fault your dad picked something you wouldn't use.  I agree with another poster that potentially for whatever reason your dad wants to make sure you're his biologically.  I don't see why else he'd be so insistent. \n\nAsk him to drop it the next time and not engage in the conversation.  Depending on your situation, I'd give back the test.  \n\nINFO: What does your mom say about it?", "Tell him that the results are NOT private, 23andme can and does sell the information.", "NTA but your dad definitely has a hidden agenda. Maybe it is time for a firm talk regarding the background of these tests?", "Btw, Elizabeth Warren took a DNA test to check if she had Native ancestry and Native people heavily criticized this. Cherokee Nation said \"being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws not through DNA tests\". So I don't know what kind of credit your father wants to get but that's not the way. It's about belonging to the People, walking the walk with them, not about DNA.", "Sounds like your dad is trying to wedge in a paternity test on the sly. No need to participate if you don't want to.\n\nNTA", "Taking the test is the most optimal solution here. It will make your dad happy. Everyone will stop nagging or talking about it. It doesn\u2019t affect you as you already expect the same result. You may have no reason for taking it, but you also have no reason not to take it. \n\nI would take it if it makes someone I love, happy. For me that is enough.", "My parents bought my wife and I DNA tests for Christmas one year. It's neat to compare how you and your siblings may each have a different percentage of everything. My oldest daughter did one too. There were no arguments about taking it, it was fun.", "NTA.  Just say \"My heritage doesn't matter to me.  I am happy with my existence\".  That's it.", "NTA yohbdont have to do any tests yoh don't want to. But I would say you may be overthinking this. Its just a fun little test. There's doubt if some of these companies even do the test properly. I wouldn't take it seriously. If he had doubts about your paternity he could have at any time of tour life managed to collect dna somehow.", "NTA it's your DNA, your choice. But I did find 23andme interetsing myself so I recommend", "NTA, those tests aren't completely accurate anyway especially when it comes to indigenous ancestry.", "NTA. Him pushing you to take it is odd. My brother did one, so there was so need for any of the rest of our siblings to take one. The results would be the same. \n\nI agree with the people who are suggesting that this may be a round about way to confirm paternity, especially since he is so very obsessed with bloodlines.", "NTA\n\nMy brother did one of these kits, so my sister and I didn\u2019t see the need to. It\u2019ll be the same answer.", "NTA but are you sure he\u2019s not trying to force you to do this because he believes there\u2019s a chance you\u2019re not his biological child?", "NTA, you don't get any kind of \"Credit \" for having trace amounts of Indigenous DNA. You have to be recognized by a tribe and documents proving lineage.", "NTA, I guess. Ultimately it's up to you.\n\nThat said, it seems like your dad really cares about this, while you're only reason for not doing it is you don't see the point - not that you're opposed to it, or don't want to send your DNA out to this company, or whatever. \n\nI think if I were in this situation and felt the same way, I'd probably just do it for my dad's sake.", "You can choose to take it or not but with 23andMe you also get a lot of DNA marks which can show you whether or not you carry certain markers for things like breast cancer, etc. It doesn't just tell you about where you stemmed from. There's a lot of medical benefits from doing the tests. It's initially why I took it. NTA", "NTA - because you shouldn\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want to.\n\nBut I do want to say this: \nYour sibling and you may all be related - but that doesn\u2019t mean you all inherited the same genes.  One of you may have gotten more of one ancestor\u2019s gene than the others.\n\nFor example - my husband has 2 siblings.  His family has African, Irish, and Native American heritage.  His brother and sister did 23 and me.  His brother had a strongly African genetic makeup.  His sister had more of a European profile.  I suspect if my husband takes it, his will be different still.  \n\nI\u2019m fully Indian (as far as I know \ud83d\ude0b) but I\u2019m still curious and my husband and I are both planning to get it done.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything nefarious going on.  It\u2019s just something fun to do.  But you absolutely shouldn\u2019t be pressured to do it!", "NTA, it's your choice to take the test or not. \n\nAlthough just so you know, you and your siblings are not all exactly the same.  Each kid gets half their chromosomes from each parent which means there are 23 chromosomes you didn't get from each parent. Different siblings are different mixtures of genes from their parents.\n\nWhich is why say, if someone has native DNA ancestry, some of their kids might get those genes which are generally associated with that ancestry and other of their kids might not get those genes.\n\nAnd if there's a genetic disease in the family, some kids might get two copies of the bad gene (thus have the disease), some kids might get one copy (thus be a carrier) and some kids might get no copies. \n\nSo while there should be no surprises in your genetic profile, there could be interesting differences between you and your siblings.", "So your dad knows your heritage but wants you to have official proof of indigenous blood so you can get \u201cperks and privileges\u201d that indigenous people have? NTA. That\u2019s a bullshit reason to get tested. I\u2019d love to know what percent your dad got on his test, I\u2019m betting it\u2019s nowhere near what would be required to get a Indian status card. Tell him to return the test for his money back.", "NTA, also paragraphs.", "NTA - maybe buy your own and try it under a false name to see if the results are the same, in case you have any doubts?", "NTA. There are serious concerns about the privacy of your genetic information once you give it to a private company like 23andMe. Also, with respect to the Native identity thing, there's a couple of problems: 23andMe is notoriously bad at tracing Native DNA because of sample size issues, and also Native identity isn't as simple as DNA. Blood quantum, enrollment politics, and traditional kinship systems are really complicated topics that I'm not qualified to speak to, but if you're curious, Dr. Kim TallBear wrote a book about it, and there's lots of Native scholars who talk and write about this stuff.", "NAH I guess but why don't you just take it. If you're so sure of the results just take it. I think you're more afraid that you're going to disprove what you know your heritage to be.", "I was going to suggest this. The fact that he won\u2019t let it go despite OP\u2019s logical reasoning that they already have the results from sibling\u2019s tests is very odd. \n\nNTA", "If I learn anything from movie, I am more than glad to kill my clone for organ replacement and family's love.\n\nThe movie title is 'Dual' for who is interested in watching. lol", "If that's the way he's going about it, he's not going to get very far. A mere blood test cannot prove he is a member of a specific tribe. He needs to provide genealogical documentation that connects him to a recognized (documented) member of that tribe. It's usually not an easy process.", "My mom\u2019s test showed 100% British Isles. My aunt, her sister, had about 5% Northern France (which we had expected). Tests can show different things in the same family", "are you talking ethnic testing or medical testing though?", "Oh you're EVIL!", "Itd be even funnier for her to give the test to a friend who wants to do it and pass it off as herself to her dad", ">but you also have no reason not to take it. \n\nThey don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s reason enough.", "I saw a Twilight Zone episode* like that years ago and decided then and there never to do a DNA test. Even if cloning is never a thing, you don\u2019t know what scientists may be able to do with it in the future. \n\n*It was a newer version of The Twilight Zone, not the one with Rod Serling. Maybe from the 90s? \n\nOP, your dad is being really weird about this. NTA.", "Oh yeah, definitely a dumb idea but people are dumb & greedy.", "That's exactly what I meant.", "That\u2019s not a \u2018reason\u2019. That\u2019s a choice. At least explain why you don\u2019t want to. Just saying \u2018you don\u2019t want to\u2019 sounds selfish when you\u2019re in a family setting and one of them spent money on something."]}
