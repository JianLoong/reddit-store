This gift severely confused me and I am going to explain why. My whole life my dad has instilled in us how important it is to know of our background and our heritage. On my mom\u2019s side we come from a small Eastern European country; on my dad\u2019s side we have Italian and South American heritage. I feel we have embraced all these things; we have Italian passports, I speak Spanish fluently, and for 20 years I and my siblings attended a summer camp to learn about our Eastern European roots. I feel very fortunate to have embraced every part of my heritage, hence my confusion for why we were given the tests. Maybe if one of us had been adopted or if we all had different parents then I\u2019d understand but that is not the case. Everyone in my family has taken the test and I haven\u2019t. I don\u2019t see a point. We all share the same DNA, it\u2019s gonna be the same results. I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re all acting surprised about their results, when it\u2019s nothing we haven\u2019t already known. My dad won\u2019t quit. He keeps saying that I need to take the test to further prove our ancestry. I also forgot to mention that my whole life I\u2019ve checked off \u201cLatina/Hispanic\u201d whenever it comes to filling out forms about your background. So again I don\u2019t understand. My dad is now saying that he has shown results of Native/Indigenous (forgive me if I don\u2019t use the proper word) blood and wants us (the kids) to take the test to get some sort of credit/proof of being Native. I keep saying \u201cwell if we are your kids, I don\u2019t see a point in taking the test\u201d. My dad is adamant that I take the test when I\u2019ve made it explicitly clear that I don\u2019t want to. My brothers also think I am being stubborn for not wanting to do it. But as I\u2019ve stated, we all have the same parents. I don\u2019t wanna take the test. I know my background. I do feel bad because I know these tests ain\u2019t cheap, and my dad went and spent money on them. But the fact he keeps guilting me to take the test because of the money I also feel is unfair. My dad taught me that it\u2019s important to know where you come from and embrace your roots, and I feel I most certainly have. So am I the asshole for not wanting to take this DNA test?\n\nEDIT: wow I didn\u2019t realize I would get so many responses, thank you to everyone for your commentary and validating me. As far as the concern of my dad\u2019s paternity, that\u2019s never been a question. My brother (27M) and I look like both our parents and our youngest brother (24M) looks like our grandfather. I don\u2019t know what his ulterior motives are, but the argument is definitely getting repetitive.

We have been mistaken for twins that\u2019s how similar we look but for our dna tests I had more European features and have a large portion of Spaniard. She had more South American and norther European. Even with the same parents you can have more dna of one over the other. If it was a paternity test then yeah that would be a super weird gift and your consent would be need but It is your choice whether to take it or not since it would be similar to if he bought you a nice item to display but it doesn\u2019t fit every occasion or decor as far as guilting you with the cost.", "NTA.

Your genetic material and control over access to it is of course very personal to you. It\u2019s your choice. If he wants to explore any indigenous heritage more, he can do that on his own and doesn\u2019t need you to.

After someone gives you a gift to do as you see fit with it.  You didn't ask for it, and it's not your fault your dad picked something you wouldn't use.

You have to be recognized by a tribe and documents proving lineage.", "NTA, I guess. Ultimately it's up to you.\n\nThat said, it seems like your dad really cares about this, while your only reason for not doing it is you don't see the point - not that you're opposed to it, or don't want to send your DNA out to this company, or whatever. \n\nI think if I were in this situation and felt the same way, I'd probably just do it for my dad's sake.", "You can choose to take it or not but with 23andMe you also get a lot of DNA marks which can show you whether or not you carry certain markers for things like breast cancer, etc. It doesn't just tell you about where you stemmed from.

One of you may have gotten more of one ancestor\u2019s gene than the others.\n\nFor example - my husband has 2 siblings.  His family has African, Irish, and Native American heritage.  His brother and sister did 23 and me.  His brother had a strongly African genetic makeup.  His sister had more of a European profile.  I suspect if my husband takes it, his will be different still.  \n\nI\u2019m fully Indian (as far as I know \ud83d\ude0b) but I\u2019m still curious and my husband and I are both planning to get it done.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything nefarious going on.

Each kid gets half their chromosomes from each parent which means there are 23 chromosomes you didn't get from each parent. Different siblings are different mixtures of genes from their parents.\n\nWhich is why say, if someone has native DNA ancestry, some of their kids might get those genes which are generally associated with that ancestry and other of their kids might not get those genes.\n\nAnd if there's a genetic disease in the family, some kids might get two copies of the bad gene (thus have the disease), some kids might get one copy (thus be a carrier) and some kids might get no copies. \n\nSo while there should be no surprises in your genetic profile, there could be interesting differences between you and your siblings.", "So your dad knows your heritage but wants you to have official proof of indigenous blood so you can get \u201cperks and privileges\u201d that indigenous people have? NTA. That\u2019s a bullshit reason to get tested.

There are serious concerns about the privacy of your genetic information once you give it to a private company like 23andMe. Also, with respect to the Native identity thing, there's a couple of problems: 23andMe is notoriously bad at tracing Native DNA because of sample size issues, and also Native identity isn't as simple as DNA. Blood quantum, enrollment politics, and traditional kinship systems are really complicated topics that I'm not qualified to speak to, but if you're curious, Dr. Kim TallBear wrote a book about it, and there's lots of Native scholars who talk and write about this stuff.", "NAH I guess but why don't you just take it.

I tried explaining to her that there is no way that is how that works due to the fact that we have the same exact ancestry.

If it were a privacy issue such as not wanting you specific DNA in some database I would understand, but your lack of understanding is frustrating. \n\nLet me walk you through it as if you're a child: Its something he became interested in, he did it, became more interested and now wants to share the experience with his kids. \n\n There is a website he can go to and it shows the family tree and he probably just wants to see all his kids on it. And you may not have the same mix as your brother. If that confuses you then google \"why don't my sibling and I have the same DNA profile\". \n\nBut again, its just something that he wanted to share with his kids and your answer to him wanting to include you is just \" I have no reason to do it so I'm not interested\".

There are almost no rules with what these companies can do with your DNA, at minimum we know they\u2019re going to use your info to work with pharma to develop drugs and make a profit. \n\nThe native thing is weird, many tribes in the US have a lot of issues with the use of genetics and indigenous ancestry. It calls back to the days of the controversial blood quotas, the companies also have a small sample size of native DNA so the results aren\u2019t particularly reliable or useful for anything.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIn my family, one of my family (way into genealogy) became convinced that our grandfather had fathered another child out of wedlock, though it could have been any of his brothers. Since my mother was the only child left, she wanted the validation by having Mum take a DNA test. My Mum said no. She loved her dad and refused to go along with something that might besmirch his memory.\n\nIf you don't want to take it, that should be an end to it. He might want to validate something in your genealogy, like my cousin, but with brothers having done it, it simply isn't necessary.", "This was my first thought.  Either he doubts her paternity or he's trying to scam someone with the \"native\" angle.  NTA", "Maybe he suspected each of them may not be his kid until they took the test.", "This is exactly why I refuse to do a DNA test. To be fair, it probably doesn't matter (that is, there's no privacy left to protect) if all of OP's close genetic relatives have taken the tests and handed over that information. But I'd still refuse on principle.", "My ex bought a DNA kit and then never used it because he was worried about what would happen to his info.  It was expensive at the time as well.  He got it for health info, not ancestry info.\n\n\nAnd it's not ancestry info.  They've only tested people who've provided DNA.  So, it won't show you where you came from, if for instance, there was a mass migration of your ancestors at some point.  \n\nPeople with Jewish ancestry won't necessarily show hits in Germany even if they had ancestors who lived there, for instance.", "This is why I wont do it.", "And bring up at the dinner table full of guests. Ask Dad, \"Did Mom cheat? Is that why you are insistent?\" Or ask,\"Mom, be honest. Did you cheat on Dad? Is that why he's insistent on the test?\"\n\nBe sure to make plenty of popcorn to share! \ud83e\udd23", "I don't so much judge people for doing it, but the amount of people who seem to think its just some goofy, harmless fun is like, distressingly na\u00efve.\n\nI get it's a self-selecting sample but I feel like I've heard ten \"welp we found a mystery offspring that biologically must be from one of the married people at this BBQ\" or \"what do you mean I'm only 17% Irish, it's my family's entire personality\" to every \"hooray, we have a new cousin and everyone's happy!\"", "This is entirely possible to have larger and smaller percentages of genetic backgrounds compared to a biological sibling. You get 50% from each parent, but there's no guarantee that your sibling will get the same two halves that you did. Unless those triplets were actually confirmed identical and didn't just *look* alike, their test results were likely accurate.", "I came to say this. I don\u2019t come from a very diverse background, and both of my parents\u2019 ancestors come from more or less the same countries. I didn\u2019t really see the point in both my brother and I doing it, but we did it anyway. I\u2019m glad we did. I was surprised at how different they were. Granted it\u2019s different percentages of basically the same 3-4 regions. It did explain a lot. My parents were basically mostly British isles with traces of other European. Each of them had traces of Italian. I got none of it, my brother got all of it from both. It explains why he can tan and I can\u2019t, haha.", "It\u2019s random. You\u2019re getting 50% of your moms dna. Of course the next sibling is going to get a completely different set of your moms 50%. You\u2019re going to pass on different traits.", "This was my thought too, non natives think all tribes get some magical casino paycheck but in reality only 39% of US tribes are able to operate a casino, and from there only 15% of those operating tribes run casinos that bringing enough money to fund community organisions like police, rec centers, or if there's anything left over, tribal benefits.\n\nYou also can't just slap a wildly inaccurate DNA test on your forehead and start rolling in the fist full of casino pennies, you need to know your family name, get in touch with your tribal council, determine if your tribe engages in BQ as a prerequisite, and if all that checks out you'll need to get registered.\n\nI don't agree with BQ but some tribes do and personally...if someone is so far removed that they're using a DNA to see if there's a sliver of indigenous in their pants then that's probably a sign that you're not going to get registered. For some tribes you have to be really immersed in the culture to be considered even if you're not very removed biologically from your tribe. It all depends on the tribe and I think some people forget there's over 500 in the USA alone with all different cultural practices and views on who is in and who is out. I don't wanna call it racist...but it's at best ignorant.", "If you have a certain amount some tribes might take you in so you can learn i believe. I guess it's their way of keeping tradition and whatnot alive", "Yup, this would be me.", "Wasn't that also sort of the plot of 'The Island'?", "I saw Infinity Pool recently. It was awesome. If you like people cloning it is pretty cool.", "The Island also has a similar circumstance in it lol", "Thank you! This is exactly what I said in my comment. This thread is full of people that believe a punnet square is the end all be all.", "Just genealogy links back to early 1800's.  Nothing medical.", "More like a country with Hunger Games involved. lol", "damn you beat me to it", "Would look up! ;)", "Oh then yes. lol", "It's very dumb, because not that many tribes directly get money from casinos. In many cases it's used to fund services, such as police services and health care. My friend is very fortunately getting dental services she could not otherwise afford thanks to her tribal affiliation.", "No means no", "'Your family spent money on something that makes you very uncomfortable, so you have to do it' is definitely not a very good reason either. I would not be putting my DNA on some for profit company's database.", "Lol what? No, not wanting to is a valid reason on its own. \n\nI\u2019ve never been skydiving. I haven\u2019t learned to crochet. I didn\u2019t read the book my aunt bought me for Christmas. I haven\u2019t done the dishes yet today. All because I simply haven\u2019t wanted to. I don\u2019t owe anyone a bigger reason than that. Being selfish with your own time, your own life, your own data is all okay.", "Also it is super scary and horrifying", "That doesn\u2019t work in a family where people respect each other.", "OP didn\u2019t say she felt uncomfortable nor did she express any suspicion towards the company. She didn\u2019t offer any reason why not to do the novelty test. \n\nNot everyone subscribes to the silly notion that companies are always up to something nefarious.", "If they don\u2019t respect \u2018no means no\u2019 then they don\u2019t respect each other, come on.", "Right. I don't owe you and explanation I said no"]}
