This gift severely confused me and I am going to explain why. My whole life my dad has instilled in us how important it is to know of our background and our heritage. On my mom\u2019s side we come from a small Eastern European country; on my dad\u2019s side we have Italian and South American heritage. I feel we have embraced all these things; we have Italian passports, I speak Spanish fluently, and for 20 years I and my siblings attended a summer camp to learn about our Eastern European roots. I feel very fortunate to have embraced every part of my heritage, hence my confusion for why we were given the tests. Maybe if one of us had been adopted or if we all had different parents then I\u2019d understand but that is not the case. Everyone in my family has taken the test and I haven\u2019t. I don\u2019t see a point. We all share the same DNA, it\u2019s gonna be the same results. I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re all acting surprised about their results, when it\u2019s nothing we haven\u2019t already known. My dad won\u2019t quit. He keeps saying that I need to take the test to further prove our ancestry. I also forgot to mention that my whole life I\u2019ve checked off \u201cLatina/Hispanic\u201d whenever it comes to filling out forms about your background. So again I don\u2019t understand. My dad is now saying that he has shown results of Native/Indigenous (forgive me if I don\u2019t use the proper word) blood and wants us (the kids) to take the test to get some sort of credit/proof of being Native. I keep saying \u201cwell if we are your kids, I don\u2019t see a point in taking the test\u201d. My dad is adamant that I take the test when I\u2019ve made it explicitly clear that I don\u2019t want to. My brothers also think I am being stubborn for not wanting to do it. But as I\u2019ve stated, we all have the same parents. I don\u2019t wanna take the test. I know my background. I do feel bad because I know these tests ain\u2019t cheap, and my dad went and spent money on them. But the fact he keeps guilting me to take the test because of the money I also feel is unfair. My dad taught me that it\u2019s important to know where you come from and embrace your roots, and I feel I most certainly have. So am I the asshole for not wanting to take this DNA test?\n\nEDIT: wow I didn\u2019t realize I would get so many responses, thank you to everyone for your commentary and validating me. As far as the concern of my dad\u2019s paternity, that\u2019s never been a question. My brother (27M) and I look like both our parents and our youngest brother (24M) looks like our grandfather. I don\u2019t know what his ulterior motives are, but the argument is definitely getting repetitive.

Your genetic material and control over access to it is of course very personal to you. It\u2019s your choice. If he wants to explore any indigenous heritage more, he can do that on his own and doesn\u2019t need you to.

After someone gives you a gift to do as you see fit with it.  You didn't ask for it, and it's not your fault your dad picked something you wouldn't use.

You have to be recognized by a tribe and documents proving lineage.", "NTA, I guess. Ultimately it's up to you.\n\nThat said, it seems like your dad really cares about this, while your only reason for not doing it is you don't see the point - not that you're opposed to it, or don't want to send your DNA out to this company, or whatever. \n\nI think if I were in this situation and felt the same way, I'd probably just do it for my dad's sake.", "You can choose to take it or not but with 23andMe you also get a lot of DNA marks which can show you whether or not you carry certain markers for things like breast cancer, etc. It doesn't just tell you about where you stemmed from.

One of you may have gotten more of one ancestor\u2019s gene than the others.\n\nFor example - my husband has 2 siblings.  His family has African, Irish, and Native American heritage.  His brother and sister did 23 and me.  His brother had a strongly African genetic makeup.  His sister had more of a European profile.  I suspect if my husband takes it, his will be different still.  \n\nI\u2019m fully Indian (as far as I know \ud83d\ude0b) but I\u2019m still curious and my husband and I are both planning to get it done.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything nefarious going on.

Each kid gets half their chromosomes from each parent which means there are 23 chromosomes you didn't get from each parent. Different siblings are different mixtures of genes from their parents.\n\nWhich is why say, if someone has native DNA ancestry, some of their kids might get those genes which are generally associated with that ancestry and other of their kids might not get those genes.\n\nAnd if there's a genetic disease in the family, some kids might get two copies of the bad gene (thus have the disease), some kids might get one copy (thus be a carrier) and some kids might get no copies. \n\nSo while there should be no surprises in your genetic profile, there could be interesting differences between you and your siblings.", "So your dad knows your heritage but wants you to have official proof of indigenous blood so you can get \u201cperks and privileges\u201d that indigenous people have? NTA. That\u2019s a bullshit reason to get tested.

There are serious concerns about the privacy of your genetic information once you give it to a private company like 23andMe. Also, with respect to the Native identity thing, there's a couple of problems: 23andMe is notoriously bad at tracing Native DNA because of sample size issues, and also Native identity isn't as simple as DNA. Blood quantum, enrollment politics, and traditional kinship systems are really complicated topics that I'm not qualified to speak to, but if you're curious, Dr. Kim TallBear wrote a book about it, and there's lots of Native scholars who talk and write about this stuff.", "NAH I guess but why don't you just take it.

If it were a privacy issue such as not wanting you specific DNA in some database I would understand, but your lack of understanding is frustrating. \n\nLet me walk you through it as if you're a child: Its something he became interested in, he did it, became more interested and now wants to share the experience with his kids. \n\n There is a website he can go to and it shows the family tree and he probably just wants to see all his kids on it. And you may not have the same mix as your brother. If that confuses you then google \"why don't my sibling and I have the same DNA profile\". \n\nBut again, its just something that he wanted to share with his kids and your answer to him wanting to include you is just \" I have no reason to do it so I'm not interested\".

I want to learn. \n\nBut, on what I hope is completely separate from that, I also feel like my ancestors went through that culture, not me.
