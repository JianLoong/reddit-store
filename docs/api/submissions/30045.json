Little sister needs to learn the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.

Send a clear message that will no longer play along with their mistaken belief that your sister's needs are more important than yours. \n\nGo to your exam. And if ANYONE has a problem with this, go LC or NC. People who genuinely care about you as a person will understand as support you in this choice. This might mean you don't talk to your parents or sister for a while. But this is better than being a doormat to your family the rest of your life.", "You don't live with them, do you? There is no way they can sabotage your exams to force you to go, right?", "That makes this an easy NTA vote from me.

This is not a wedding planned 9-12 months in advance.", "LOL, it sounds like she found some poor sucker to marry her just so she can create drama around the time for your finals.

Your sister is obviously self-centred and the fact she wants you to postpone years of hard work for a quickie wedding just shows what kind of person she is.

A wedding is (usually) a once in a lifetime experience, and unless OP's sister knew the dates of the exams before they started planning the wedding (which, since I'm planning one over 15 months away, unlikely), it's not her fault either.\n\nI understand the implications behind people who would misuse this system, and the fallout that would incur. But I think it's bold to defend a university for sticking to a strict rule of order for something that impacts them so minimally. \n\nAll in all, I understand the universities view, but I absolutely would not even pretend that that's the standard by which life should be experienced. I would never refuse care from a doctor because I found out they postponed their exam for a wedding, and realistically the university is more than capable of postponing it. They do all the time for the immutable. They just don't want to. And I think that's sad", "Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

Good luck with your finals.  Do update.  I really want to know that you passed.", "I doubt it was ever on her radar. She probably picked it without thinking of anyone else\u2019s time or schedule.

Literally any of the other 50 weeks of the year and there would be no problem. \n\nEven if she didn't know the exact date, this could have been avoided.  Her failure to plan does not constitute an emergency for the school.\n\n*But I think it's bold to defend a university for sticking to a strict rule of order for something that impacts them so minimally.*\n\nThis may not be the university's decision.

There's a very solid chance OP was holding out hope to make sure their exam day didn't collide with the wedding and they would have found a way to make it work. Unfortunately, the days intersected.", ">This may not be the university's decision.\n\nShame, but still not worth defending the policy as a core good as opposed to something needing change.\n\n\nAs for not planning during certain months of the year, I do kind of agree, to a point. Some exams are December, some are January, some are April, some are June. I do agree maybe some more due diligence could have been done by OP's sister, but at what line does that become unreasonable? I think this argument is essentially a house of cards: stable in some situations, but shaky in most. If they're marrying on an anniversary/any significant date, OP's sister can't be expected to substitute that for OP's future medical exams.\n\nAt the end of the day, I still believe the bride holding I'll will towards OP is difficult to justify, and the \"choosing education over family\" is a BS take by problematic people. But fundamentally, this situation should be more avoidable where neither of the parties this story contains are at fault. Accommodations should be significantly more accessible, and the expectations held of OP's sister to have \"planned better\" are significantly more unreasonable IMO.", "*If they're marrying on an anniversary/any significant date, OP's sister can't be expected to substitute that for OP's future medical exams.*\n\nThen she'll have to make a decision won't she.  Is the date more important than her sisters attendance?\n\n*choosing education over family is a BS take by problematic people*\n\nIs family going to pay her student loans if she can't become a doctor for another year?  No?  Then her education is more important in thus instance. \n\nAnd in general, education is more important than a *party*  There's no reason OP can't celebrate the sisters marriage in another way.  Marriage is so much more than the ceremony. \n\n/the wedding day is the least important day of your marriage.  \n// ten year anniversary is this weekend.", "If you really cared about your sister you would skip your exams, YTA.", "That\u2019s kind of unfair. The wedding could have been planned much further out than the exam schedule. Exam schedules are usually posted at the start of the semester and weddings can easily be planned a year out.", "This is so true. As a new doctor, you will have an internship and residency, and you will work longer hours than more senior staff. You will be working on holidays. The folks who have to work Christmas, New Year's, etc do try to have a celebration at work so you don't miss the holiday completely.  Your family will  learn that your work takes priority and you will learn to ignore their complaints", "This was my question. Like how could these two things overlap?", "It is not OP's job to plan her sister's wedding date around her exams.

No medical school is going to accommodate this.", "actually she means prioritizing her entire future over the wedding. if this is the career she\u2019s been working toward for a decade and she doesn\u2019t take that test she has no job and no future. OP\u2019s sister couldn\u2019t be more selfish for thinking her wedding is more important than someone\u2019s literal entire future. \n\nOP is for sure NTA.", "Then logically because your career, which has put you or your partner or your parents into major debt to get this far and be this successful (by the way congratulations your doing an amazing job!)

I know thats an option at my university but it's a whole process and not a guarantee of happening", "I mean\u2026usually there is a way to accommodate scheduling conflicts at any school.

I think NAH instead, this is the reality of becoming a doctor", "I just looked, and the academic calendar for the school where I attended grad school is available right now through the end of school year 2025, including exam dates. And even if it weren't, the sister still could have asked if she actually wanted OP there, and OP could have said, \"well, I know my finals will be in May, but I'm not sure when,\" and then the sister could have decided whether she wanted to try to plan around that. But she didn't even bother to ask whether OP had any conflicts she already knew about. Because she doesn't actually care whether OP is there.

If it were important to her to have you at her wedding, she would have confirmed the date with you before she set it.

As well as the salary you\u2019re missing during that time when you could have had a job but instead had to spent retaking them? Since her *big day* is more important than taking your exam\u2019s, wouldn\u2019t she be willing to show *how important* it is by offering to offset the costs because *you have to attend* her wedding.

Thank you.  Seem like most of these people calling OP TA have no clue about how much time, cost and difficulty of medical school and the exams that they have to pass after.

But if she misses her finals she would fail the classes. Even if she took the classes again she\u2019d have to get an A in them to get a passing grades because most colleges combine the grades you got each time you took the class. If she can\u2019t get A\u2019s then she can\u2019t pass the classes and then she can\u2019t graduate medical school. She doesn\u2019t graduate she can\u2019t become a doctor.\n\nAlso, hospitals could find out what her grades were and that she had to repeat classes and why.
