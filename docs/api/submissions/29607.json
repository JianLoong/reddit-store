Our daughter goes to school in the town her mother lives in, and is currently a member of the school's marching band. Last Friday night, my kid had a band event at the high school. She brought the instrument that she normally uses, which is the one which her mom (and her mom's new boyfriend) had purchased for her. Please note that when our daughter 1st showed interest in band, her mother and I were trying together to find a clarinet for her because we both felt that the recommended company from the school was asking too much for a clarinet, $1,500. A few days later her mother messaged me and said she had gotten her a clarinet on her own. I asked how much, and her only response was to tell me to purchase one on my own for our daughter to use when she's with me.I managed to find a new one for a little under $200. Turns out my ex and her boyfriend decided to buy the $1500 school one.\n\nThat Friday, my girlfriend and I pick up my daughter after school at 3:30 pm, thus beginning my weekend custody. At 5:30 we take her to the high school. She does marches, plays her instrument, a good time is had by all. By the time it all ends and the kids are released, it's almost 9 pm.\n\nAs we're leaving the high school, my kid tells me her mom wants us to stop back at her house (15 minutes away) so she can change out of her band clothes and bring back the clarinet. I told her no because it was late and we still had to get food and possibly check out a local Halloween yard display.  My kid damn near has an immediate panic attack and says, \"We have to bring them back! [The boyfriend] said he'd hunt me down if I don't bring it back!\"\n\nI reiterated that we wouldn't be going, and said that if her mom wanted us to stop back she should have talked to me first, not send messages via our kid.I then texted her mom:\n\nMe - Hey, we won't be stopping back.  It's way too late\nMy ex - No she needs to bring her stuff back\nMe - No.  You are welcome to come pick it up if you would like. \nMy ex - You drive right past my place.  Bring her back and drop off the stuff I pay for\n\nShortly after the last text I got a phone call from a number I didn't recognize. I let it go to voice-mail.  It was the boyfriend saying I needed to bring her band stuff back.  I then sent another text to my ex\n\nMe - To reiterate, you are more than welcome to come get everything when we get back home.  But we have plans for tonight and they don't include waiting outside your house.\nMy ex - Waiting for what? She just had to drop off the stuff I pay for\n\nI ignored her after that.  And in actuality we did not drive right past her mom's place.  All was quite until about 11:45 at night when I get another call from the boyfriend. It was an almost 3 minute drunken voice-mail saying I should have brought her stuff back because he pays for it and I don't. \n\nThe clarinet made it back to my ex's house on Sunday night.", "created_utc": 1698192816, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17frowe/aita_for_not_returning_my_kids_instrument_to_her/", "score": 1179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Definitely worth investigating because that's nuts. I don't know if he just has a problem with you, or her using the clarinet. Because what if she wants to practice while she is with you? What if her marching band / band has an away show or competition? It could be as simple as a talk, as having her use the clarinet you found for less, or getting a lawyer involved in case more in going on underneath the surface because, again, that was a lot of panic and anger.

Save that message as others have recommended.\n\nBut also, speaking as a music teacher, this is a ridiculous discussion and really ESH.

It doesn\u2019t sound like anyone else in either household plays clarinet, so why does anyone need HER instrument back? \n\nIf your daughter continues in band (I hope she does!), let her be responsible for her own supplies. Does she have 2 math binders, or a school backpack at each house? Get over yourselves and don\u2019t make it so clear to her about who is paying for what. Figure that out between the adults, leave her out of it, and let her handle HER clarinet.

Either you take the few minutes to drop the stuff off and ease your daughter\u2019s anxiety, or you address the threats made to her by her stepparent. Ignoring this and leaving her concerned all weekend is the only option here which isn\u2019t acceptable but you chose that one to prove a point. You say this is about your time with your daughter but then you ensured she wouldn\u2019t enjoy that time because you didn\u2019t want your ex to \u201cwin\u201d.\n\nI get that you\u2019re doing that on principle and you think your ex and her partner are taking liberties with your time, but you swinging by their house takes a max of two minutes off your time with her while you walk the stuff to the doorstep and ring the bell. You can then watch from the car with your daughter until it\u2019s collected or take a photo and send it to your ex without ever having to be there when the door is opened - is that really so much to ask?\n\nThe reasons your ex and her partner suck are more or less the same - they sent a child into a panic attack over the level of aggression they\u2019re prepared to use to win the power struggle with you. But underneath that, their concern that an 11-year-old might leave her instrument behind at the end of the weekend and then be without it to practice all week is pretty valid tbh, especially if she has another instrument to practice with at your house.\n\nSure, they overreacted. But even if you didn\u2019t start it, you need to either address it or comply rather than just allowing that behaviour toward and around your daughter to continue to mess up her mental health.", "YTA for not realising something more is going on here if your kid is that worried about not taking the clarinet back. And if you noticed your kid was that upset, you should have just dropped it back to calm her down.

Your ex and her partner are weirdos for insisting she use two clarinets instead of just letting her have the one instrument, but you're putting extra stress on your kid by holding onto this point. She doesn't need to be in the middle of this bickering between her two homes, and if you can make her life easier by swinging by her mom's place, I think you should.

Even if the boyfriend hasn\u2019t put his hands on your daughter he\u2019s doing some serious damage to her mentally", "YTA for putting your child through that much stress over an instrument, and for ignoring the glaring signs that your ex\u2019s boyfriend is not someone who should be around your kid.\n\nAlso, where in the world do 11 year olds participate in marching band? The kid is in 5th or 6th grade.", "NTA. It\u2019s not normal for a child to have a panic attack over something so trivial which makes it sound like ex or the boyfriend are mentally abusing your child at the least. \n\nSave the voicemail. Use it to challenge custody along with the observed matter of the incidents. Start a notebook listing out the date, activity, and why it caused your child anguish. You can attempt to talk to ex about boyfriend but expect it to go like taking to a brick wall. Document that as well. Take this to your lawyer.", "NTA", "Info: do you have a history of not returning things?", "NTA, but you don't need to be on a reddit form. You need to be on the phone to your country's child protective services and a lawyer.", "You are kinda the AH. It probably wouldnt have taken very long to drop the shit off and leave. But the way your kid reacted and the way the mom and bf were acting is well is a red flag. You should probably get to the bottom of that.", "If they were concerned for the welfare of the instrument and uniform they could have made an appearance at the end of the event to collect them.  Simple", "NTA.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m not sure about your legal arraignments, but my child ever said that to me about their other parents partner, I wouldn\u2019t take them back to them, at all. I\u2019d be filing for sole custody immediately. It seems like she is in an unsafe position to me. Children are easily bribed, and I bet a $1500 clarinet can buy some degree of silence.", "ESH \n\nYou needed to protect your kid here. For whatever reason, they don\u2019t want the $1500 instrument at your house. I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s important, and your kid really understood this boundary and knew there could be consequences if that wasn\u2019t followed. Perhaps that\u2019s unfair or inappropriate but the fact is, you were weirdly combative off the bat, and it suggests to me that they worried there\u2019d be issues with the clarinet at your house.\n\nThe fact that she had such an intense reaction plus his drunken message suggests there are issues here. Look into that, but this time, you needed to bring her back to drop it off. For her own peace of mind.", "YWBTA to your child if you don't document everything and talk to a lawyer. Also, therapy is a good idea.\n\nTrust my experience in that just because she *says* he hasn't hurt her does not make it true. She could be afraid of what he will do to her (or to you) if she tells you.\n\n\"If you tell x anything, I will kill them\" is a favorite tactic abusers use to ensure secrecy.", "Her reaction is concerning. May be worth looking into. I will say though\u2026my kiddo had a panic attack when i stopped for ice cream a few days ago and handed her the debit card to go buy it. Tears and all. Either way, NTA. Mom shouldnt make decisions on what you do w your time without asking. Assuming they are functioning adults, nothing was stopping them from picking it up if it was that important.", "YTA for not immediately starting to look for a therapist for your kid and an attorney yo deal with your trashy ex and her verbally abusive partner.\n\nHoly fuck the amount of straight up denial and ignorance is absurd.\n\nYour kid *essentially had a pabic attack* over something insignificant because of your ex and het partner. And you are on *reddit*?!\n\nEmbarrassing. What an increduble failing of your parental duties. Do better.", "Poor kid to be put in the middle of this.\n\nNTA her bringing it to her mom's Sunday night was acceptable. Also those items are your daughters,  so  as long as she has possession of them there shouldn't be a problem as to who paid for them", "Agree OP there is something wrong here, her having to take back the clarinet isn't normal behaviour. NTA", "My guess: the boyfriend is bitter he and the mom paid $1500 while OP only paid $300. He probably feels like somebody tricked him, and is lashing out at the kid", "Threats of violence can be just as damaging as physical follow-through. I believed my caregiver when he threatened me, and as a result I developed PTSD at age 4", "My ex was abusive. The physical stuff was easier to deal with than the control, the mental abuse, the walking on eggshells, the heat beating out of my chest in fear at his reaction. Bruises heal fast, mental abuse trauma still haunts me. It's been years.", "Dont waste your breath. Your ex cant see the massive red flag of having a drunken bf who lords his money over her own kid \u2018you better toe the line cuz i pay for all of this, you better listen and be grateful! This item that i bought for you actually belongs to me and im going to hold that over your head forever!\u2019 You have much bigger issues than this stupid instrument and you need to come up w an action plan (start by informing your lawyer and having a convo about changing the custody arrangements)", "Anger is scary to a child\u2019s mind. I\u2019m sorry she has to go through fearing an adult she should\u2019ve been able to trust", "Yet. He hasn't physically assaulted her...yet.", "> and though the boyfriend does have a lot of anger issues, she swears he has never put his hands on her.\n\nI'm sure that's true.

Messages, screenshots etc \n\n\nNTA .\n\nalso tell your ex she better get her bf in line to stop with the threats or you get a protection order for your child against him.  He's traumatising your child with his threats. If you can bring your  daughter to a few therapy sessions to speak about it.\n\nIt's your ex and his decision to pay so much for the instrument your daughter didn't forced anyone to anything and if he ever threatens her again file a police report ( I would do so now but this would complicate your kid s life)\n\nSo gather evidence scrupulously and take action when necessary.", "If any adult ever told my kid they would hunt them down I would have serious issues with that", "Also, just because he hasn\u2019t hit hurt doesn\u2019t mean he WON\u2019T hit her.\n\nShe\u2019s not safe OP", "I am so so sorry for what happened to you.
