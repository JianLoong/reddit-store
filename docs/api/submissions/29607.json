Our daughter goes to school in the town her mother lives in, and is currently a member of the school's marching band. Last Friday night, my kid had a band event at the high school. She brought the instrument that she normally uses, which is the one which her mom (and her mom's new boyfriend) had purchased for her. Please note that when our daughter 1st showed interest in band, her mother and I were trying together to find a clarinet for her because we both felt that the recommended company from the school was asking too much for a clarinet, $1,500. A few days later her mother messaged me and said she had gotten her a clarinet on her own. I asked how much, and her only response was to tell me to purchase one on my own for our daughter to use when she's with me.I managed to find a new one for a little under $200. Turns out my ex and her boyfriend decided to buy the $1500 school one.\n\nThat Friday, my girlfriend and I pick up my daughter after school at 3:30 pm, thus beginning my weekend custody. At 5:30 we take her to the high school. She does marches, plays her instrument, a good time is had by all. By the time it all ends and the kids are released, it's almost 9 pm.\n\nAs we're leaving the high school, my kid tells me her mom wants us to stop back at her house (15 minutes away) so she can change out of her band clothes and bring back the clarinet. I told her no because it was late and we still had to get food and possibly check out a local Halloween yard display.  My kid damn near has an immediate panic attack and says, \"We have to bring them back! [The boyfriend] said he'd hunt me down if I don't bring it back!\"\n\nI reiterated that we wouldn't be going, and said that if her mom wanted us to stop back she should have talked to me first, not send messages via our kid.I then texted her mom:\n\nMe - Hey, we won't be stopping back.  It's way too late\nMy ex - No she needs to bring her stuff back\nMe - No.  You are welcome to come pick it up if you would like. \nMy ex - You drive right past my place.  Bring her back and drop off the stuff I pay for\n\nShortly after the last text I got a phone call from a number I didn't recognize. I let it go to voice-mail.  It was the boyfriend saying I needed to bring her band stuff back.  I then sent another text to my ex\n\nMe - To reiterate, you are more than welcome to come get everything when we get back home.  But we have plans for tonight and they don't include waiting outside your house.\nMy ex - Waiting for what? She just had to drop off the stuff I pay for\n\nI ignored her after that.  And in actuality we did not drive right past her mom's place.  All was quite until about 11:45 at night when I get another call from the boyfriend. It was an almost 3 minute drunken voice-mail saying I should have brought her stuff back because he pays for it and I don't. \n\nThe clarinet made it back to my ex's house on Sunday night.", "created_utc": 1698192816, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17frowe/aita_for_not_returning_my_kids_instrument_to_her/", "score": 402, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Definitely worth investigating because that's nuts. I don't know if he just has a problem with you, or her using the clarinet. Because what if she wants to practice while she is with you? What if her marching band / band has an away show or competition? It could be as simple as a talk, as having her use the clarinet you found for less, or getting a lawyer involved in case more in going on underneath the surface because, again, that was a lot of panic and anger.

Seems like everyone lives near the school. I think if she is that concerned about it she should have called you or made a plan to drop off or pick up the clarinet instead of telling your daughter to tell you. I feel bad your daughter is caught in the middle of that.

Do something.", "Ok NTA for all of the red flags listed about the boyfriend. Save that message as others have recommended.\n\nBut also, speaking as a music teacher, this is a ridiculous discussion and really ESH. Why does your daughter have to play on a different instrument depending on who she\u2019s with on any given week? Why tf is this turning into a parental dick measuring competition over an 11 year old\u2019s instrument? It doesn\u2019t sound like anyone else in either household plays clarinet, so why does anyone need HER instrument back? \n\nIf your daughter continues in band (I hope she does!), let her be responsible for her own supplies. Does she have 2 math binders, or a school backpack at each house? Get over yourselves and don\u2019t make it so clear to her about who is paying for what. Figure that out between the adults, leave her out of it, and let her handle HER clarinet. You guys are really not setting her up to have a well adjusted middle school and high school experience if she has to be concerned about who \u201cowns\u201d HER materials.", "Everybody is the asshole here. It is just a stupid power struggle.", "NTA (obviously), but please do something about your ex\u2019s boyfriend. I\u2019m worried about your poor daughter being around him.

Keep all those handy. NTA", "ESH - all of you adults are using your kid as a pawn in your power struggles and it sucks. Either you take the few minutes to drop the stuff off and ease your daughter\u2019s anxiety, or you address the threats made to her by her stepparent. Ignoring this and leaving her concerned all weekend is the only option here which isn\u2019t acceptable but you chose that one to prove a point. You say this is about your time with your daughter but then you ensured she wouldn\u2019t enjoy that time because you didn\u2019t want your ex to \u201cwin\u201d.\n\nI get that you\u2019re doing that on principle and you think your ex and her partner are taking liberties with your time, but you swinging by their house takes a max of two minutes off your time with her while you walk the stuff to the doorstep and ring the bell. You can then watch from the car with your daughter until it\u2019s collected or take a photo and send it to your ex without ever having to be there when the door is opened - is that really so much to ask?\n\nThe reasons your ex and her partner suck are more or less the same - they sent a child into a panic attack over the level of aggression they\u2019re prepared to use to win the power struggle with you. But underneath that, their concern that an 11-year-old might leave her instrument behind at the end of the weekend and then be without it to practice all week is pretty valid tbh, especially if she has another instrument to practice with at your house.\n\nSure, they overreacted. But even if you didn\u2019t start it, you need to either address it or comply rather than just allowing that behaviour toward and around your daughter to continue to mess up her mental health.", "YTA for not realising something more is going on here if your kid is that worried about not taking the clarinet back. And if you noticed your kid was that upset, you should have just dropped it back to calm her down. Your petty feelings towards your ex and anger at her \u201csending messages through your kid\u201d are going to negatively impact your kid in the long run.

Your ex and her partner are weirdos for insisting she use two clarinets instead of just letting her have the one instrument, but you're putting extra stress on your kid by holding onto this point. She doesn't need to be in the middle of this bickering between her two homes, and if you can make her life easier by swinging by her mom's place, I think you should. Especially if her mom's boyfriend is insisting on \"hunting her down\" - show her that you're the trustworthy parent by doing this for her.", "Oh man, thats a rough situation.. My thoughts are that the person paying for the instrument has the right to get it back at the end of the day. Your exes boyfriend has no right to harass you about it. But it's always a nice favor to let the kid keep it. I would say youre NTA as the mom and her boyfriend should have made it clear they expected the kid to leave with it if that was the plan. You dont want to be responsible for the instrument when youre not the one watching it.", "NTA. It was your parenting time with your daughter and they don't get to insert themselves.
