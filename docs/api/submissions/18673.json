You were fed up and emotional but you don't owe them anything. You can choose to explain in the future if you want.", "NTA.\n\nGetting a cut, wash, dye, blow out around here is almost $200. For that much money plus a tip that hair stylist had better treat me like freaking Princess Diana.", "I think your reaction to the hair stylist was a bit unwarranted, however, your hair stylist shouldn't be berating you about what you do with your hair because after all it is your hair and you can do what you want with it. NTA", "Absolutely NTA. Your stylist has no reason to berate you. To inform you that box dye is terrible for your hair and give you alternatives if you can't get in, sure. Berate you about what you do to your hair, nope. Does she berate you for daily styling, as that is pretty damaging to hair as well? \nIf she truly cared that much about your hair, she could have offered DIY hair treatments from the salon. Instead she chose to end a professional relationship.", "Nta! People have lives that preclude getting into a salon. And box color has come a long way in 20 years. She wasn\u2019t being professional. You aren\u2019t wrong for being angry that someone you are paying was being disrespectful.", "NTA . Yes box dye is a pain in the ass but I\u2019m sure you know the consequence of box dye when you did it. Honestly, if they didn\u2019t want to work on your hair, they have the right to decline you. Other than that, it\u2019s doing too much. You go there to get your hair done, not to be lectured.", "NTA\n\nYour hairdresser should have treated you with kindness and appreciated you coming back in after the pandemic caused most of the US to have to deal with their own everything. Instead, they shamed you and treated you poorly. \n\nThey are a business. If they shame or berate their customer base, they deserve to lose their customers. \n\nAnd yeah, boxed dye has come a LONG way and there's plenty of beauty supply stores and youtube tutorials so people can do their own hair now, so it's even more dumb of your stylist to not be super kind and grateful for your business. F her.", "NTA. And wtf Is wrong with using home hair colour? Not everyone has the $$$ or time for a salon. Been using box dye for 35 years and my waist long hair is doing fine thank you", "No. NTA. That was unprofessional.", "Hairstylist here! I would never shame a person using box dye or doing a DIY job!

So many home fades!\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05) came back to me with quite interesting looking haircuts!\n\nWe both just laughed and I fixed it!\nNTA! So no worries!", "Nta, she works for you not the other way around.", "NTA. your hair stylist should have kept her mouth shut instead of treating you like a child. ignore the manager and your kids. go elsewhere for cuts. it\u2019s an expensive lesson for the hair stylist not to misuse client relationships.", "NTA", "My very young hairdresser pulled this one out on me about box dyes.\nI  agree  not here to listen to them complain about what we do, we make the choices we need to at the time.\nSlowly changing my colour to something more low maintenance because there is no way I am paying that much money to be told what I am doing is wrong.", "Nta. I have never had a hair dresser talk bad to me when I used box color or other means to color my hair.", "Ohhhh\u2026 It sounds like you took some frustration out on the hairdresser maybe? I mean no one wants to be lectured about what they do with their own hair but your reaction was a bit much. I\u2019m gonna say softly YTA because I don\u2019t think your hairdresser deserved to be cursed and walked out on like that.\n\nYou\u2019ve also been getting your hair done for 20 years, box dye cannot be removed from your hair and some stylists won\u2019t even take you on as a client if you have it in your hair. They don\u2019t just say it because they don\u2019t want you to save money, it\u2019s because the effect it has on hair.", "Oh my goodness I'm so sorry for your loss. That's such a tragic story. I'm glad you were able to be there for him and your partner. Also, screw the salon manager for even remotely attempting to gaslight you. What \"miscommunication\" was there?

Did she know what you were going through? If so, then she's T A all the way. If not, then in her eyes, it just looks like you flew off the handle after 20 years for no reason. \n\nAnd dude, I don't think you realize just how much box dye sucks. I understand how she was feeling when you came in, after 20 years of doing your hair, and realized all the correction she was going to have to do and how much MORE it's going to cost you. And good luck finding another hair stylist who is willing to correct it for you at an affordable cost. Also, if she has rapport in the area, finding someone to do your hair who has skill is not going to be as simple as you think. Hair stylists weave tight knit social groups and you may just be on the outs. You might be stuck with a newer stylist who may not have the skills required to fix what you've done.", "YTA. Box dye is a convenience for you and I get that but it makes your stylist job harder to correct and that\u2019s why she discouraged you from using it. Did she know about your life events? If not, then the whole thing could have been avoided by saying something like, \u201cI know you\u2019re not a fan of box dye but it\u2019s been a hellish few months and that is why I haven\u2019t been in regularly\u2026\u201d Unless she\u2019s a mind reader or has a crystal ball, you should apologize. Doesn\u2019t mean you have to go back. And the way you acted in the salon, she might not want you back. She also could have handled it better TBH. But if you\u2019ve had this long lasting relationship, you should be able to actually TALK it out.", "She cares about you, and i think you should go back. Explain what happened and open up a bit. Sometimes part of a professional relationship gets blurred into personal. She felt comfortable getting on your case about it because she has known you for 20 years. That's a friendship.\n\nNAH , just explain what happened and that you were still stressed out about losing your FIL.\n\nIf you want to. If you were ready to switch hairdressers anyway, go ahead. But that's a 20 year association with someone. That's a heck of a thing to throw away after one 'fight'.", "A very gentle YTA from me. Not for using the dreaded box, but for ending the relationship. You were stressed and flew off the handle a bit. If you value her friendship, give her a call and talk it out. If not, then no biggie", "YTA because you escalated the interaction for no reason. but overall you\u2019re NTA because it\u2019s totally fine to switch hair stylists \u2014 for any reason!! i switch every 5th cut lol", "she's been your stylist for 20 years, you have teenaged kids but you've been seeing her since you were a kid?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The worst place to be judgmental anyway is in a salon or some other aesthetic service, it\u2019s just bad customer service. She could\u2019ve done much better here. The reaction is honestly the fair result of a hairstylist finding out after having fucked around.", "Well said.", "Yeah, even just a cut is a lot, I would be so annoyed at being scolded by another grown person for my choices. Of course she would rather you spend the $200 vs $30 for box dye.", ">For that much money plus a tip that hair stylist had better treat me like freaking Princess Diana.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nGuide you into an unhappy marriage as a teenage virgin? Hound you with paparazzi? Cause your death by \"dangerous driving\"? \n\nMaybe not the best analogy.", "I am sorry that you have been going through a difficult time, but I agree that your reaction was a bit much. You knew that she was particular about dyes and had continued to go back. You need to figure out if this is worth ending the relationship over. Once you determine that, you can decide how to proceed.

My hairdresser didn\u2019t mind, but asked me to use the lightest version of my color I could find,so when I came back it wouldn\u2019t be hard to redo it.", "There are a lot more harsh chemicals that can damage your hair and scalp.\n\nMost stylists also hate it because it can make evenly dyeing your hair a lot more difficult. Removing box dye is a lot trickier than virgin hair, and requires a good deal more care to prevent your hair from breaking or turning a nasty shade that'll take multiple sessions to fix.", "A lot of them (not all) have harmful and harsh chemicals compared to an ethical salon. If you're buying the top of the range ones, that are high quality and fairly natural, you're probably not saving that much money. \n\nI spent a good decade destroying my hair with cheap box dye and excess heat treatments, and it ruined my underlying colour (red) and my texture (dense curls) for most of another decade. \n\nOf course I didn't give a shit as a teenager or in my early twenties, but healing it took a lot of time. Mine is also waist length. If yours is doing fine, great, but I did a lot of damage to mine and I suspect if yours is doing fine you're in the lucky minority from talking to friends and family.", "Because of life curveballs, I ended up doing my bf\u2019s hair repeatedly.

She\u2019s NTA, that hairdresser was out of line.", "Oh my god it\u2019s not that big a deal to use box dye and then go to the salon a few weeks later. My hairdresser colored my hair all the time after I would have a \u201cmoment\u201d and do it myself. That stylist was rude, and OP was rude back. OP should apologize for blowing up and cursing at her stylist, and then decide if she wants to go back to her or not. She can apologize AND go to a new stylist. The apology would be as much for her, just to clear that negative energy.", "Harder for her to correct? That\u2019s what OP is paying her to do omg. If it\u2019s more labor she should be charging OP a higher rate. OP is NTA for wanting to take their business elsewhere. Maybe shouldn\u2019t have cursed but NTA overall.", "The stylist was completely unprofessional. A professional would have opened the conversation with, \"What's going on? I know you don't normally go for box dye.\" Instead she was rude and aggressive right off the bat. That's not okay, and she was right not to put up with it.", "If life is so difficult that she cannot handle customers who use box dye, she\u2019s in the wrong profession. This is part of being a stylist. A customer using box dye is no reason to berate them.", "I\u2019ve been going to the same beautician for 10 years. The moment she shamed me for considering getting laser treatment for my broken capillaries I walked out and never came back. \n\nInteracting with someone for 10 or 20 years doesn\u2019t automatically make them a friend.

I don\u2019t pay my friends to hang out with me.", "**They\u2019re not friends.**\n\nThis woman provides a service and OP is a client. It\u2019s unbelievably unprofessional, disrespectful, and inappropriate to speak to a client that way, particularly since OP hadn\u2019t been in for likely longer than usual. Anyone who actually has a clue in that line of business would assume that a regular client of 20 years who comes in on a usual schedule could ***possibly*** have had something happen. In 20 years of a professional relationship the only other time OP used boxed dye was during the PANDEMIC. That stylist was unreasonable and rude. To a loyal customer. If she\u2019s that stupid and that entitled to think she can treat a loyal customer of 20 years like that, she doesn\u2019t deserve OP. **NTA**.", "Lol imagine being anxious about seeing your stylist, thinking she will be mad at you for doing something she doesn\u2019t approve of. That\u2019s ridiculous for a service.", "Maybe the hairdresser needs to learn to shut up and do her job.

She's being nice to your face but the moment you walk out the door and no other guests are in ear shot, she's bitching about it. I hear it all the time.", "Exactly. The stylist should have said \u201csince you used box dye, it will be a bigger job this time and we will need to charge a color correction fee. Is that okay with you?\u201d And then OP can walk out or pay the extra fee.", "I know, right? \n\nReplies like that one make me realize that people don\u2019t know what it means to be an actual friend. It\u2019s a professional relationship and nothing more.", "Yeah, I can\u2019t believe some of these comments. \u201cAfter 20 years you\u2019re friends\u201d. Lol, nope. It was a loyal customer and trusted stylist.", "I think it was tiktok, but I got chewed out by angry stylists who were asking \"why do clients lie to us about box dye\" this post is why. NTA", "I mean, okay??? Doesn't change the fact that most  box dyes have ammonia, PPD, salts and peroxide in them. While salon dyes typically don't.\n\nWhy even bother asking if you're going to argue with every person who answers because 'Well that's not my experience!'.", "I started watching The One Minute Barber on YT and doing bf\u2019s haircut with the video still on. This guy is great, I\u2026 am not. I just hope the barbers he goes to also have a good laugh when they see him.\n\nI stand by my judgment though. My home do is still better than him looking like Harry Potter circa Goblet of Fire.", "That\u2019s just catty ass shit and it\u2019s disgusting that you are defending it.  If a stylist cannot handle a client that uses box dye, then they should go do something easier that isn\u2019t quite so challenging. It\u2019s part of the damn job.", "\u2728 ~capitalism~ \u2728", "Please tell me how you think salon dyes work? It\u2019s still chemicals, not magic", "Eh. Color corrections take longer and use more products. Both cost money. \n\nThe last time I had to do a color correction, we basically had to dye my hair twice, tone it, and then do a treatment to strengthen it after all the dye. \n\nDon\u2019t bleach and dye your hair blue at home folks. It will fade to a vomit green.. and then don\u2019t bleach it again thinking that will get the green out. Doesn\u2019t work.", "As I literally said, salon dyes have less harsh chemicals than box dyes. It's like vinegar & baking soda vs bleach. They're both going to clean up the mess, but one is a lot harsher on your skin and strip away the surface."]}
