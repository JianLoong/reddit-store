I can imagine there are big emotions for all. Could you have a conversation with Mike about what is and isn't okay in how he supports your son?

EVERYONE with half a brain knows how unlikely it is to be placed in a good home is when it comes to foster care. You didn't give a damn about your kid and you come here thinking you'll be anything but an AH.\n\nYou do know that we all know you went to jail because you refused to testify against that \"fabulous father figure and role model\" the loser that committed a crime serious enough to be sent to prison for YEARS.

I feel bad for your son", "YTA but a soft, soft one. \n\nI think you're uncomfortable with the fact your son was in foster care at all and you probably want to be super parent now. Mike probably makes you feel a bit threatened too, because he stepped in when you couldn't. It probably seems that Mike did too good of a job for your comfort. You're back now, back where you wanted to and needed to be with your son, and it probably feels like Mike is overstepping big time. All of this seems extremely valid and in no way am I faulting you for any of this. \n\nThing is, Mike and your son bonded during a very difficult time for your son. There's no changing that. Mike was integral for your son's survival for a whole year, a whole chunk of your son's life. He made your son's life the best it could be during a very stressful time  Chances are your son changed Mike's life significantly too. Like it or not, Mike was a father figure to your kid right when your kid needed it the most. Expecting Mike to switch lanes is the most comfy for you but the least comfy to your son (and yes, to Mike). \n\nI'm sure it feels very frustrating that Mike is still very involved and it probably feels like he's trying to do way more than he should since he's not your son's father. But here's the thing: this isn't about you. It isn't really about Mike either. It's about your son. \n\nAll that said, I'd be hella annoyed as well in that same situation. You've got to reframe this in your mind or you'll drive yourself crazy.", "I understand Mike getting attached, but it sounds like he's trying to co-parent. Depending on how your son feels about Mike, I could see fostering a big brother/uncle type connection.\n\nEdited after reading comments.

If you feel he is overstepping boundaries you should have a discussion with him about that, maybe with a neutral party there, but to not invite Mike to the party will harm your relationship with your son when he finds out.", "Not clear cut answer here but why wouldn't you want the person who cared for your child when you couldn't, to remain in their life as a constant source of support?", "Yta.

It\u2019s his birthday, not yours. As his father is absent at this time, a positive male role model who cares about him is a good thing- why are you so determined to deny him that?

For whatever reason you and the father put yourself in a position where you weren\u2019t able to care for your child for a year.  That is a huge parenting fail.  I think you should be open to the idea that you have some things to learn as a parent.  That maybe your husband is not a \u201cgreat\u201d dad.  Your standards for great need to be raised for your child..\n\nYour child should dictate the relationship with Mike.  You should take time to learn from Mike what her figured out about your child during the time.  A year can be a huge percentage of a child\u2019s life depending on their age.", "Info. What does your son want?", "YTA. This man bonded with your son, clearly cares, and is a good influence. Having more adults to take care of and look out for a kid is only to their advantage.", "YTA", "What about your son\u2019s rights? He has a right to a stable home. You did not provide it, so the state and our tax dollars took care of him for you, along with Mike. Now that you\u2019ve once more taken responsibility for your child, you don\u2019t give us any indication if your kid would LIKE Mike there, if MIKE helps him feel safe. I mean, two both parents are convicted felons and one is still incarcerated. Considering rates of recidivism, odds are the state might need to take your kid again. Might be nice to build a relationship with someone like Mike to have on speed dial \u2014 for bail money at least. YTA.", "YTA. If i had to define your behavior I'd go with immature, jealous, and down right trashy. Mike sounds like 1000 times the \"parent\" you will ever be.", "YTA based on your comments. The problem is that you're focusing everything on technicalities instead of looking at the actual emotional wellbeing of everyone involved.\n\nMike's continued involvement should be dependent on one person's opinion: your son's. Before reading your comments, I was going to ask for more information about his feelings before judgement. But you state that Mike shouldn't be a father figure because your son already has a father figure. This is very narrow-minded and petty. Kids can have multiple father figures. Your son having a relationship with Mike in no way detracts from his relationship with his own father.\n\n*However*, you are right that Mike is not entitled to a fatherly relationship with your son. He should not try to dictate how you raise your son. You are not incorrect in stating that Mike was a temporary legal guardian. He is not a co-parent. Many children wouldn't form a close bond with a legal guardian in just a year. But, again, a lot of this really goes back to what your son wants. Mike is not entitled to more involvement if your son is not interested; you'd have no legal or moral obligation. But if your son is interested in further contact, it'd be cruel to exclude Mike just because he's not technically entitled to that contact. \n\nBefore you have any further discussion with Mike, I'd sit down and have a talk with your son about his feelings towards Mike. If he views Mike as family, then you should start including Mike in more family-oriented events. If he doesn't and sees Mike as more of a cool older adult he'd like to stay in contact with, then go from there.\n\nEdited for jumbled wording.", "YTA.

Think about that. Your son is going to visit a jail for his birthday. His birthday is being celebrated in jail. That's not a good look.\n\nFor one, ask your son what HE wants for his birthday, does he want to see his father on that day? Does he want Mike there for his birthday? And LISTEN to what he wants. You were gone from him for a year because you couldn't bother to go to court. His father isn't in his life because he's also in jail. Mike parented your son for you, who knows how your son feels about you because of that.

But nothing about the person this actually affects)\n\nYou were in prison for contempt of court, his father is still in prison. Your son must have a very limited sense of security, which Mike provided. You are taking away whatever stability your son had, for your own selfish motivations. \n\nThink of it this way, both his parents were taken away from him, he finally bonded and felt safe with someone, now, you are taking that away from him as well. Even though you are back, you are showing him you are not safe, you are taking away his security.\n\nI\u2019d highly suggest seriously thinking about this and talking with your son, and Mike. He\u2019s going to need help adjusting after your abandonment and sudden reappearance.

Your son already has a dad and he will be coming back eventually.\n\nOn the other hand, think about this from your son's perspective. He's only nine, you don't have a great understanding of the world at that age. From his perspective, both his mum and dad abandoned him, and the only person who cared for him in that time was Mike.  And now Mum's back, but Dad is still gone and Mike has abandoned him. \n\nObviously, to you and I as adults, you didn't abandon him, but kids think differently to us. Their brains aren't fully formed yet.  They don't understand the world yet. All he sees is that his parental figures have left him, one after the other. One came back, but maybe she'll go away again, he doesn't know. He's probably terrified of being abandoned again. \n\nHis real dad isn't coming back for a long time (or at least, a long time by a child's standards), so maybe letting Mike stay in his life would be a good way to help alleviate those feelings of abandonment.  If he likes Mike, then... doesn't that just mean he's got a bonus parent? Lots of kids have bonus parents. It doesn't stop them from knowing who their real parents are. It just gives their support structure a little extra stability.  \n\nI saw someone else suggest letting Mike stay in his life in an uncle role, and I fully support that.  Cutting him off completely won't be good for anyone, so I feel like having a foster uncle would be better for everyone. Even you, when you think about it. I mean, you've gone from being stuck in prison to being a single parent for the next four years. Being a single parent is hard! And you're a single parent to a little boy who is about to go through puberty, and I hear that's rouuuuugh for boys. Wouldn't it be nice to have someone you can fall back on when you need a break? Or a babysitter? Or just need some you time?  Or when someone starts getting stinky and needs a talking to but won't talk to Mom because \"OMG MOM YOU'RE SOOOOO EMBARRASSINGGGGG!\"?\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling. Your story struck a chord with me because I was separated from my own mother for a few months when I wasn't much older than your son is now, and I remember how I felt. It was awful.

The way everyone is acting is daft. Like you did a violent crime or drugs or something and that you\u2019ve done something to not deserve your kids. Even the biggest of drug addicts get their kids back and then put them in awful conditions so that they spend their lives in and out of foster care. Your son only had to spend 1 year in foster care so he\u2019s one of the lucky ones.

He\u2019s done his job as foster parent now and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re not completely cutting of his and your sons relationship. But you are 100% allowed to have boundaries. Mike doesn\u2019t have guardianship over your son anymore. And he shouldn\u2019t be in your sons life as a father figure or in a parental capacity. The correct term would be positive male role model. You\u2019ve said yourself in multiple comments that you\u2019re not trying to stop their relationship, but you want Mike to be separate from family functions and that\u2019s completely ok. Is it wrong of Mike to ask? No not really. But is it wrong of you to say no? No it\u2019s not. You\u2019re his mother and you can still make the decisions. You\u2019ve even offered an alternative of meeting up for lunch or something. Why are people calling you the AH for that? Yeah I get he was your sons foster dad for a year, but that doesn\u2019t give him a right to integrate with the family permanently if the parents don\u2019t want him to. His job is reunification and he has to accept that. In the future, who\u2019s to say it isn\u2019t more damaging and confusing for your son to keep seeing Mike when his own dad comes back home and they\u2019re working on their bond?

There\u2019s been several social workers commenting that Mike\u2019s behaviour is a red flag and that he shouldn\u2019t be doing this. The only thing I would say is maybe wait for another day to take your son to visit his dad and do something together on his birthday. I get he wants to see his dad, but it is his first birthday back with you after a year and maybe he shouldn\u2019t spend it visiting prison. It should be spent doing something fun for the whole day. But again that is your decision at the end of the day and your son is 9 turning 10 and he should get a decision of what to do on his birthday.", "NTA.

I don\u2019t know your life or your circumstances or why you felt that was the better or safer choice. \n\n-regaining custody after your incarceration?

No, not even while he is in prison, unless the father is dangerous to your child. \n\n-making a prison visit part of 10th birthday plans? Maybe, though it\u2019s possible this is the right decision for your family.

Once it has you in its crosshairs, you either STFU (that's what OP did) or turn states evidence (that's what the prosecution wanted her to do). Either way, you might as well kiss your life as you know it goodbye. \n\nSo OP's partner was accused of harboring a fugitive. Who? What? And what was their crime? It is such an open-ended charge it is practically a catch-all. \n\nAnd contempt of court *is* a catch all.\n\nIn certain communities, you are effectively guilty until proven innocent even before you are charged. So what do you do? You stick with the ones who have your back: your family and friends. You DON'T rat them out. \n\nNTA", "If that\u2019s what the child wants and that would be healthy for them, then sure. But who says that\u2019s what the child wants?  OP said Mike reaches out to her son, not the other way around. And who says that would be in the child\u2019s best interest in this case?", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any clause in any foster agreements that says foster parents cannot have any contact with the child once they return to their family, but the goal of fostering is to eventually reunify the child with their parent/family. The fostering relationship is meant to support the reunification process. The foster parent is basically providing a service to the child, the family, and the state. But once reunification occurs, that service is over. The foster parent has no rights to the child after that and should allow the child and their family to take the lead in determining what kind of relationship, if any, the foster parent will have with the kid afterwards. It\u2019s not the place of the foster parent to force connection, if that\u2019s not what the family or the child want (or if it would interfere with the child successfully reintegrating into their family).", "So you think people who have been to jail couldn\u2019t possibly care about their child\u2019s well-being? Why does one exclude the other to you?\n\nI think you\u2019re suffering from a fundamental lack of perspective and compassion. It\u2019s very presumptuous to assume that having served time in jail means you can\u2019t be a loving parent. (It\u2019s also very presumptuous to assume that only guilty people have ever seen the inside of a jail cell, but that\u2019s a whole different argument).", "Probably should have been of realization.", "This is what I\u2019m thinking", "Yikes on bikes even. Jfc.", "And I repeat, OP has admitted that both crimes were avoidable but they chose to commit them anyway, resulting in jail time for them and foster care for their son. They created this mess. Judging from OP's attitude, she hasn't learned a thing from all this.", "Give the poor kid a chance to have a role model who isn't a jailbird.", "In all fairness, OP clearly hates Mike. Her son might not be comfortable telling her the truth about how he feels about Mike.", "I don\u2019t know does this nine year old child have a phone?", "This isn't r/legal advice, we're discussing what's morally correct, not legalities. And what's morally correct here, is what's in the best interest of the son. Given how disruptive it must have been for the son to have been moved into foster care and back out again, having a stable adult figure remain in his life would probably be of benefit to him.\n\nOP should ask her son if he wants Mike there or not, and it should be up to him. Not for OP to assert her dominance in some kind of power play.", "I mean, mom is making the kid spend his birthday at a prison. Not the best decision making on the part of the birth parent. Makes sense that Mike is worried .", "Shes not saying he cant be in his life she just wants him to not be there on his birthday.", "Where is your compassion for the foster dad, Mike? I believe that OP loves her son but she made a mistake that changed his entire life for a year. She put him in a situation where he could have been abused, neglected, mistreated or worse. Luckily, he was put into the care of a man who actually cared about him, but OP would rather be jealous than recognize that. She should ask her son if he wants Mike around and then work for there, instead of just pushing Mike out.", "We are talking about this specific situation. It\u2019s very \u201cpresumptuous\u201d, to use your word, to assume how I feel about all parents with records.\n\nThis woman wants to take a child to a prison on his birthday. That\u2019s not in his best interest. \n\nOP chose to hide a fugitive knowing the consequences.", "Seriously. It's not hard to stay out of jail.", "Mmm\u2026who said the child\u2019s only role models are \u201cjail birds\u201d? Why is Mike the only non-jail bird you can think of that could possibly be in OP\u2019s son\u2019s life?", "It\u2019s not a power play to assert your rights as a parent. And I agree that it\u2019s in any child\u2019s best interest to have stable parents/role models/etc. in their life. But it\u2019s not a previous foster parent\u2019s right to assert themselves as this person. Parents, family, friends, loved ones, youth workers (teachers, social workers), etc. build a child\u2019s community. Mike (foster parents, in general) can\u2019t force themselves to remain in a child\u2019s community/support system once fostering has ended. \n\nThere are instances where foster parents are a part of that support system - either permanently or just for a time - and when it happens that way, and child and family are happy with that, great. If not, then the foster parent needs to learn how to bow out. Temporary custody does not give a person the right to insert themselves into another family. Even if Mike is more stable in some ways, that does not qualify him to stay in a child\u2019s life past the timeline the courts set up. \n\nAnd let\u2019s be real: there have always been and will always be families that have less money than others. Less education than others. Parents with better parenting skills than others. Parents with cleaner criminal records than others. Does that mean those who are/were less stable in such areas are less capable of being loving parents? I think not. Just because someone\u2019s background is different or their circumstances aren\u2019t as favorable as others, that does not give those in a better situation the right to insert themselves into another family\u2019s situation. Are we going to start mandating foster parents be allowed to be \u201crole models\u201d the foster child\u2019s life In perpetuity whenever a child enters and then leaves the foster care system? \n\nEither legally or morally, that would make no sense and that would not be the right thing to do. Even when parents mess up, or when circumstances just dictate they aren\u2019t able to take care of their child for a time, it is not right to alter their family dynamics any longer than necessary. People have a right to do the best they can for themselves and their families. And it\u2019s wrong to take away their chance at that - or interfere with it. Just because someone serves as a foster parent does not mean they need to continue to participate in the life of the child once the child has left their care.", "A former foster parent pretty much tells the mother what she should do (in spite of what he's telling her not to do being exactly what the kid wants to do) and then ***tries to invite himself to the kid's party***. Morally, that's the type of thing that should get Mike's ability to foster taken away. I don't care if he was the foster father, something that's kind of temporary by design, he has no right to force his way into this full-on kids party where there's only going to be a few adults in the first place. That's a bit creepy don't you think.", "As per her comments, he wants to see his dad, so making is the wrong word to use here.", "Right, we\u2019re talking about this specific case. In this case, you assumed OP didn\u2019t care about her son, but Mike did. What makes you assume that? Because she\u2019s been to jail?\n\nAnd her son wanted to visit his father on his birthday. His father is in prison, so that\u2019s where he wanted to go. It\u2019s not pretty, ideal, or anywhere anyone would want to go under normal circumstances. But it\u2019s where he wanted to go to see his father.", "Well, you'd think if the kid had so many upstanding people in his life, one of them could have taken care of him instead of him going to a stranger in foster care.\n\nI'm tired of shit parents like OP somehow claiming moral superiority because \"they are are the parents and know what's best for their kid\" when they made the choice to commit actions that send themselves to jail and make their child live with a stranger. Then they just waltz back into their kid's life and try to separate the kid from someone he was ostensibly close to. OP should be thanking Mike every day that he was the kind of foster parent that cares about their son instead of one of the horror stories.\n\nBut clearly OP and partner didn't care enough about the risk that their child could be traumatized and abused in foster care to not go to jail - pretty low bar.", "Asserting your rights has a limit. Your role as a parent is to protect your children and teach them, not hide them away from a person who they can learn from and fall back on if ever needed. Reliability and stability.\n\nMike seems to want to be in his life, Mike is seemingly a good person.\n\nThe parent gets a say, yes, but the choice in this situation should go to the son seeing as the parents *willingly* abandoned him for a year.\n\nThe only reason for rejecting this is because the parent is guilty or jealous."]}
