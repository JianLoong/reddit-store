I can imagine there are big emotions for all. Could you have a conversation with Mike about what is and isn't okay in how he supports your son?

EVERYONE with half a brain knows how unlikely it is to be placed in a good home is when it comes to foster care. You didn't give a damn about your kid and you come here thinking you'll be anything but an AH.\n\nYou do know that we all know you went to jail because you refused to testify against that \"fabulous father figure and role model\" the loser that committed a crime serious enough to be sent to prison for YEARS.

I feel bad for your son", "YTA but a soft, soft one. \n\nI think you're uncomfortable with the fact your son was in foster care at all and you probably want to be super parent now. Mike probably makes you feel a bit threatened too, because he stepped in when you couldn't. It probably seems that Mike did too good of a job for your comfort. You're back now, back where you wanted to and needed to be with your son, and it probably feels like Mike is overstepping big time. All of this seems extremely valid and in no way am I faulting you for any of this. \n\nThing is, Mike and your son bonded during a very difficult time for your son. There's no changing that. Mike was integral for your son's survival for a whole year, a whole chunk of your son's life. He made your son's life the best it could be during a very stressful time  Chances are your son changed Mike's life significantly too. Like it or not, Mike was a father figure to your kid right when your kid needed it the most. Expecting Mike to switch lanes is the most comfy for you but the least comfy to your son (and yes, to Mike). \n\nI'm sure it feels very frustrating that Mike is still very involved and it probably feels like he's trying to do way more than he should since he's not your son's father. But here's the thing: this isn't about you. It isn't really about Mike either. It's about your son. \n\nAll that said, I'd be hella annoyed as well in that same situation. You've got to reframe this in your mind or you'll drive yourself crazy.", "I understand Mike getting attached, but it sounds like he's trying to co-parent. Depending on how your son feels about Mike, I could see fostering a big brother/uncle type connection.\n\nEdited after reading comments. Mike sounds like the most stable person in your kid's life right now, and a way better father figure than the guy in prison who you are taking your kid to for his birthday. YTA", "Op decided not to testify in court, probably to help her boyfriend, and got sent to jail over it. You picked your boyfriend over your son and chose jail.

He is your son's friend and your son will be inviting other friends to his party, won't he?  It looks like his bio dad is not a fixture in your son's life. You should ask your son what he wants.  If you feel he is overstepping boundaries you should have a discussion with him about that, maybe with a neutral party there, but to not invite Mike to the party will harm your relationship with your son when he finds out.", "Not clear cut answer here but why wouldn't you want the person who cared for your child when you couldn't, to remain in their life as a constant source of support?", "Yta.

It\u2019s his birthday, not yours. As his father is absent at this time, a positive male role model who cares about him is a good thing- why are you so determined to deny him that?

For whatever reason you and the father put yourself in a position where you weren\u2019t able to care for your child for a year.  That is a huge parenting fail.  I think you should be open to the idea that you have some things to learn as a parent.  That maybe your husband is not a \u201cgreat\u201d dad.  Your standards for great need to be raised for your child..\n\nYour child should dictate the relationship with Mike.  You should take time to learn from Mike what her figured out about your child during the time.  A year can be a huge percentage of a child\u2019s life depending on their age.", "Info. What does your son want?", "YTA. This man bonded with your son, clearly cares, and is a good influence. Having more adults to take care of and look out for a kid is only to their advantage.", "YTA", "What about your son\u2019s rights? He has a right to a stable home. You did not provide it, so the state and our tax dollars took care of him for you, along with Mike. Now that you\u2019ve once more taken responsibility for your child, you don\u2019t give us any indication if your kid would LIKE Mike there, if MIKE helps him feel safe. I mean, two both parents are convicted felons and one is still incarcerated. Considering rates of recidivism, odds are the state might need to take your kid again. Might be nice to build a relationship with someone like Mike to have on speed dial \u2014 for bail money at least. YTA.", "YTA. If i had to define your behavior I'd go with immature, jealous, and down right trashy. Mike sounds like 1000 times the \"parent\" you will ever be.", "YTA based on your comments. The problem is that you're focusing everything on technicalities instead of looking at the actual emotional wellbeing of everyone involved. \n\nMike's continued involvement should be dependent on one person's opinion: your son's. Before reading your comments, I was going to ask for more information about his feelings before judgement. But you state that Mike shouldn't be a father figure because your son already has a father figure. This is very narrow-minded and petty. Kids can have multiple father figures. Your son having a relationship with Mike in no way detracts from his relationship with his own father. \n\n*However*, you are right that Mike is not entitled to a fatherly relationship with your son. He should not try to dictate how you raise your son. You are not incorrect in stating that Mike was a temporary legal guardian. He is not a co-parent. Many children wouldn't form a close bond with a legal guardian in just a year. But, again, a lot of this really goes back to what your son wants. Mike is not entitled to more involvement if your son is not interested; you'd have no legal or moral obligation. But to exclude him from further involvement over if your son is interested just because he's not *technically entitled* to it would be cruel. \n\nBefore you have any further discussion with Mike, I'd sit down and have a talk with your son about his feelings towards Mike. If he views Mike as family, then you should start including Mike in more family-oriented events. If he doesn't and sees Mike as more of a cool older adult he'd like to stay in contact with, then go from there.", "YTA.

But he took care of your son for a year. He's certainly earned the privilege.", "NTA - Setting boundaries for someone who seems to be overreaching his role as a foster guardian is needed. Yes, it may be hard for Mike to detach from your son but that is on him. You have every right to create a birthday celebration that does not include Mike. I would keep their contact to text/phone for awhile.  Yes, he is not entitled to be treated like family.", "How long has your husband been in prison for?

Think about that. Your son is going to visit a jail for his birthday. His birthday is being celebrated in jail. That's not a good look.\n\nFor one, ask your son what HE wants for his birthday, does he want to see his father on that day? Does he want Mike there for his birthday? And LISTEN to what he wants. You were gone from him for a year because you couldn't bother to go to court. His father isn't in his life because he's also in jail. Mike parented your son for you, who knows how your son feels about you because of that.

Your son must have a very limited sense of security, which Mike provided. You are taking away whatever stability your son had, for your own selfish motivations. \n\nThink of it this way, both his parents were taken away from him, he finally bonded and felt safe with someone, now, you are taking that away from him as well. Even though you are back, you are showing him you are not safe, you are taking away his security.\n\nI\u2019d highly suggest seriously thinking about this and talking with your son, and Mike. He\u2019s going to need help adjusting after your abandonment and sudden reappearance. (And yes, it will definitely be something that feels like abandonment from his perspective)\n\nIf you keep going on this course, you will only succeed in driving your son away from you, and cementing trust /abandonment issues.", "NTA.", "Mike is more of a parent than your sons sperm donor.

YTA.", "Light YTA.  On the one hand, I can completely understand why you feel uncomfortable about the situation. Your son already has a dad and he will be coming back eventually.\n\nOn the other hand, think about this from your son's perspective. He's only nine, you don't have a great understanding of the world at that age. From his perspective, both his mum and dad abandoned him, and the only person who cared for him in that time was Mike.  And now Mum's back, but Dad is still gone and Mike has abandoned him. \n\nObviously, to you and I as adults, you didn't abandon him, but kids think differently to us. Their brains aren't fully formed yet.  They don't understand the world yet. All he sees is that his parental figures have left him, one after the other. One came back, but maybe she'll go away again, he doesn't know. He's probably terrified of being abandoned again. \n\nHis real dad isn't coming back for a long time (or at least, a long time by a child's standards), so maybe letting Mike stay in his life would be a good way to help alleviate those feelings of abandonment.  If he likes Mike, then... doesn't that just mean he's got a bonus parent? Lots of kids have bonus parents. It doesn't stop them from knowing who their real parents are. It just gives their support structure a little extra stability.  \n\nI saw someone else suggest letting Mike stay in his life in an uncle role, and I fully support that.  Cutting him off completely won't be good for anyone, so I feel like having a foster uncle would be better for everyone. Even you, when you think about it. I mean, you've gone from being stuck in prison to being a single parent for the next four years. Being a single parent is hard! And you're a single parent to a little boy who is about to go through puberty, and I hear that's rouuuuugh for boys. Wouldn't it be nice to have someone you can fall back on when you need a break? Or a babysitter? Or just need some you time?  Or when someone starts getting stinky and needs a talking to but won't talk to Mom because \"OMG MOM YOU'RE SOOOOO EMBARRASSINGGGGG!\"?\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling. Your story struck a chord with me because I was separated from my own mother for a few months when I wasn't much older than your son is now, and I remember how I felt. It was awful. The way I see it, it's better to have extra parents than not enough, you know?  Or parents plus a bonus uncle. \n\nGood luck!

All because you say that people \"have father's in prison\" like that will redeem your decision. You clearly just want another excuse to see your husband and is willing to force your son to spend his bday there to satisfy what YOU want.\n\n You have to be a troll because if not than you are a terrible mother for not seeing how bad you have been behaving.

You admit that your son bonded with him and now you\u2019re trying to pretend he doesn\u2019t exist.  If he were your son\u2019s father, you\u2019d be straight up committing parental alienation.
