If she wanted to be the one getting called Mommy, then she should have stepped up to the plate.", "NTA - You are the one providing them with stability and a safe place to live and grow up. The kids should be the one to decide who is given the title of Mum/Dad, and it is pretty clear that they feel you are the one worthy of this title. \n\nIt is unfortunate, but if Jen wants to be granted that title, she needs to embody a mother, and that just isn't the case right now.", "NTA\n\n>still crying and asking for her mommy and everyone figured out who she was talking about\n\nIf this is how they view you then who is to argue with them?

And *you earned it.* Those kids identify you as mommy because that\u2019s who you\u2019ve been to them. You give them love and a safe home. She is not their mommy just because she gave birth to them. She kind of forfeited that right by refusing treatment. I feel for her and hope she gets the help she needs, that she can only get when she herself accepts it, but her actions had consequences. And one of those consequences is that she is no longer mommy to these kids.

Jen is lucky they have you and are not in foster care somewhere.\n\nAdvice:  Spend time loving those kids and waste no time on telling them not to call you \"Mommy\" if that's what they choose to do.", "NTA, you didn't train them to call you mommy,  you are just the only mommy they have ever actually had.  Instead of being mad about that, she should be embarrassed that she isn't that to them.", "I'm probably gunna get some shit for this but NTA\n\nthose kids deserve a stable environment and people to call parents. every kid does unfortunately not everyone who can have kids should.\n\nthis situation is entirely your SIL's doing and can only blame herself for failing her children.\n\nme and my wife are raising her nieces taken into care from her younger sister, its permanent and she's had at least 2 more kids who we couldn't take on unfortunately. has she seen the girls even once in the ten years they've lived with us despite living ten minutes from her parents house where she currently lives.\n\nshe got in touch a few months ago demanding contact and how HER daughters love her more than anything....\n\nthey are MY daughters.

You didn't tell the children to call you mommy.  And, I can see why the mother got upset and other family members got involved (they might be the only AHs here - accusations of trying to steal the children are dramatic and untoward). The mother is struggling with a lot and having her kids reject her like that and call someone else mommy has to elicit a lot of pain and shame. That's not your fault, but it does require you to make a decision going forward. \n\nShe is still their mother and she's still trying. Yes, she's failing, too, but that's to be expected given her situation. A gentle reminder that she is indeed their mother is appropriate. They can still love you, bond with you and acknowledge the active (though problematic) relationship they have with the woman who gave them life.", "NTA but I think you should very gently remind your children that they have another mother, even when she's not in a place to care for them. \n\nI would not keep them from calling you whatever they want and it's wonderful they feel so accepted by you and your husband!! I am only saying this because it's important for the kids to be open and honest about the situation. \n\nIt will help them understand what happened to them and it's important to have those conversations from a time they're very young so that they grow up with it being normal and not something they can't ask questions or talk about.", "INFO: What do these interactions with the kids look like? Have you gently told them that you aren't their mother, but their aunt? If you have done that and they call you \"mommy\" anyway, I think you're right not to push it.\n\nIf you instruct them to call you \"mommy\" or you haven't attempted to gently redirect them once or twice, then maybe I'd be more inclined to agree with your SIL. But if you are simply allowing the children to do what comes naturally to them, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Especially since you are the one who brings stability in their lives.", "NTA but you need to instill the boundaries of aunt vs mother with the kids.

You are the stable loving force in their lives.  NTA", "NTA,  these kids have been with you for the better part of 6 months, for a 2 year old thats a lifetime.  You are the only mom she knows.  If your SIL wants to be a mom thats fine, she needs to put in the work to get a handle on her current health issues and bad habits first.", "NTA. My ex used to declare that every item that he lost had actually been stolen. \u201cSomeone broke in and stole the TV remote\u201d is an actual example. You\u2019re not stealing the kids, Jen is losing them and her family is doing her no favors by pretending otherwise.", "NTA> Kids generally call it as they see it. As long as you try to foster the relationship when it is reasonable, it is what it is.", "NTA You're serving in that role, and she doesn't look like she's going to be able to be a suitable mommy.", "NTA. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks but those kids and you.", "A 2 year old will call the person they spend the most time with Mummy. Even if it's dad :P My kid used to call her grandfather Mum too :P \n\nNTA. Amazing for you to be able to take in your niblings and give them the loving home they need", "NTA \n\nWhy the f would you deny those kids calling you mommy? Why don\u2019t they deserve to call the most stable adult in their lives by that title?", "Absolutely not, at a mere 2yo of course she knows you as her mommy. Her real mother doesn\u2019t care for her o max daily. Not TA!", "NTA. You are her safe space and the most constant provider of love and support in her life- this is mommy.", "NTA\n\nYou have essentially raised the kids she keeps producing. You are providing a safe and loving home for them, you got the title she is apparently not capable of living up to. Pissing on you for a 2 year old calling the only person she remembers as a mother speaks worlds on the complainers character imo.", "Someone tie SIL\u2019s tubes please. Nta", "No, NTA. I knew a lady who had a daughter in a similar situation. She'd let her granddaughter call her Mom. When I first heard, I thought she was a late-in-life parent. Nope.", "NTA, these kids clearly love you and feel safe with you, to the point where they see you as their mommy. you love and take care of these kids better than their actual mom does", "NTA But I'd like to know where is bio dad in all this? Assuming he's ops brother or her husband's brother?? Or is the SIL the husband's sister? Why do the dads never seem to catch any blame?", "NTA\n\nI'm not sure what the issue is. She knows she's a bad mum. Her kids don't live with her. Her visits have to be supervised. Luckily you took them in. It's like she blotted out the fact that she's a bad mum and can't face it. Shees triggered so blaming you. \n\nHopefully she'll realise how shot it feels to have her kids call someone else mommy. She'll use it as an incentive to  get her life in order and win her kids back. \n\nLooks like she's playing victim instead.", "NTA... The mommy is the one that is providing care. I'm sure that you are not trying to do anything more than provide a safe enviroment for these children that are in an unfortunate situation.", "I read the title wrong and was ready to call you T A but you absolutely are NOT. Those children have decided you are their mom. You seem to be thoroughly earning that title - keep it up! NTA.", "NTA. You and your husband have basically saved these kids. Why should it matter what they call you? As far as they are concerned you are their mother, and kids are strangely honest about these things when they are little! Their mother should use this situation as motivation to sort out her health and addiction issues so she can have a part in her kids lives, otherwise she needs to be prepared that she isn\u2019t going to.", "NTA, and Jens family saying you are trying to steal her kids, you cannot steal something that has been abandoned, so they are 100% being AH. If they were that concerned, why are none of them looking after the kids?", "This lady should be kissing the ground you walk on, and so should the rest of your family. You\u2019re doing for those kids what they could not/would not. Absolutely NTA", "NTA, SIL needs help.", "Nta. Unless you force them to call you that. Personally, i would never allow it & think you should probably rethink this.  esp because mom is still in their lives, they should be old enough to understand what that word means. Even if mom passes or drops out of their lives, at some point, they may resent you hard for this. You can fulfill this role without replacing their actual mom. You can be their hero, their world, their everything without taking that spot. Make your own spot. Im raising my granddaughter. Shes 6, i completely get it. Her brother is 13 & lives w his dad. Its been a 12yr battle. She is in treatment right now (not optional) & it seems to be going well but she isn't getting daughter back until we know shes clean/together for awhile or unless the court forces us to. My granddaughter has asked a few times to call me that. I just have to keep telling her that we are all on the same team (hers), that good or bad, she has a mom & i dont ever want to take a piece of her identity away. That i am ok & happy just being grandma (step). I don't need to be mom to help. \n  May confuse.the younger ones too", "Nope, why would you be?", "If Jens family are so concerned why Are aren\u2019t they watching her children ? NTA. You created a safe environment for this women\u2019s children. You might not have given birth to them but they love you. This girl loves you. You take care of her. NTA. You are a wonderful person OP to take care of this women\u2019s children.", "So I am split on this. I was also in a situation like this where I had to take care of a relatives kiddos for many years, and the kids called me Mommy; however, I never called myself mommy to them. They would say, \"mommy can we ...\" and I just let it go, but if I was asking them something I would say \"aunt ____ needs you to ...\" I know it is just semantics, but in my mind it made a difference because other people didn't hear me calling myself their mother. Good for you for stepping up!", "YES! You are TA!!!\n\nI I honestly cannot believe how ignorant you are to mental illness and addiction. I am 8 years over not that it matters but I'm sure it does to you, I only drink alcohol. I have met many people who are parents struggling with addiction you don't know where they're coming from you don't know how they got the substances but trust me when I tell you that it is a very hard addiction to be able to get off of.\n\nAnd no of course she does not want help. Do your research go to some Al-Anon meetings and maybe you will understand where she's coming from. And then on top of that she has you coming in and her kids are calling her mommy how would that make her feel how would that make you feel?\n\nShe's already dealing with enough in her life and then she has to come home to her own kids not even calling her mother which is not the case. You are not their mom and you're not making her recovery process any easier.\n\nSo please tell me where in the story you are not the asshole because in quite honestly it hasn't said that you've been any other help. \n\nAnd hey guess what maybe if you actually tried to help the mom figure out her situation instead of bombarding her and accusing her of being such a crappy parent maybe you would solve the problem of not having to be a surrogate parent I don't know that's just a thought.\n\nSo please after you've been to some Al-Anon meetings and you've understood how addiction works these people are struggling they need help they don't need people who are constantly criticizing them about their addiction you think that people want to get addicted and want to be shitty parents maybe some sure but you should probably give her the benefit out and in this case I'm not going to give you the better cuz you're sober and you don't have an addiction problem apparently you're not even mentally incapable of having some empathy for another human being.\n\nTo be honest I think you should need some therapy because you have some mental illnesses that you probably have an address yet if you are seriously going to sit here and let three kids call you Mommy when they have a whole mom who needs their love and affection right now and he's understanding.", "Yes, YTA. 100 percent.", "Yta for the title lol but nta in anything else.", "Parent is both a noun and a verb. She may be their biological mom, but you have been their mom in all the ways that count. If she doesn't like her daughter calling you mom, she could turn her life around. NTA and bless you for being there for these kids.", "This. And, OP, if it's possible to stop the visits, I would. And I'd block all the family who seem more concerned with this adult women than her innocent children.", "Hard agree. If a kid shouts \u201cmommy!\u201d The one who comes running every time is mommy. Not the one who shat you out", "You can\u2019t steal something that someone else has thrown away.", "Your grandmother fucked up.", "Sounds like the children WILL be hers very soon. This isn't a temporary foster situation - this is on the way to being permanent.", "Do you actually  think she has any choice in the matter? When children are removed from the bio parent, the state becomes their legal guardian and calls all the shots, right up until a full adoption takes place. They are also the ones that decide when to take it to court, and ultimately what to ask the courts to do. Termination of parental rights takes a little time. Sometimes the  (bad or missed) visits are the evidence needed to make it go through.", "It's not lying. My adopted son calls me mom and he didn't come to us until he was 15. Pretty sure he knows I'm not biologically related. \\*eye roll\\*", "She is responsible for finding her own rock bottom. These children know who birthed them, and this is differnt to them then their Mom and Dad, the people who care for them.  This is not causing confusion, the ones that are parenting the children are not to blame.", "Little kids don\u2019t owe their parents Jack shit. They\u2019re the innocent and wronged party here.", "Honestly, I don't give a fuck what their mom needs. The kids need a stable parent that is capable of not losing custody for more than 4 months even with us taking care of the kids in the mornings before school, in the afternoons after school, and overnight a few times a week when she does have custody. Her parental rights are going to be terminated soon (should've been terminated a long time ago) and we'll be able to get a restraining order and keep her out of the kids lives because that's what's best for them.", "Once they adopt, which sounds like it will be within the year, she WILL be mommy. Why change that back and forth now? Because I do hope you understand that adoptive parents are *parents*!", "You adopted, that isn't what happened in this situation. The mother still has occasional custody and it sounds as if it is at least possible that the bio mother would eventually get full custody back if she cleans herself up.\n\nIf full custody changes hands then that is different, especially as long as the bio-mother consents to the adoption.", "From your comment, apparently all of your children call you a variation of Father/Mother.\r  \n\"Padre\" is father in Spanish. And just out of curiosity, in Brazilian Portuguese it's \"Pai\". And there are derivatives, such as \"Papa\" or \"Papai\", which also means Father (similar to daddy).\r  \nThis estrangement is common, since the word \"Padre\" and \"Papa\" can refer to church offices.\n\nThere are other derivations, since Portuguese and Spanish is used in many countries.\r  \nBut, I just found it curious to clarify that the \"Padre\" that your son speaks, is the synonym of Father/Dad  (both in Portuguese and Spanish).", "Oh my gosh. I cannot imagine what that is like for you to have to lose them for months at a time at such a young age, and into such a lions den. I know it\u2019s not the topic of this post, and I agree with others here that you are Nta and the daughters choice to call you mommy is her own. But wow. That must be so hard", "And It\u2019s for that reason, my APs went with international adoption\u2026or one of the reasons anyway", "There were actually relatively recent story in reddit, where one kid didn't remember how bad parent was and another did; when parent came to their life later, the younger fell all in, and hated on older how they do not love said parent.", "It's hard but we still see them every day and have them overnight a couple times a week that makes it easier.", "My son calls his aunt and uncle\u2026 Aunt Kevin and Uncle Marie. \ud83e\udd23", "You sound like an idiot. Are you not aware that plenty of parents lose custody of their children, and those children are then adopted by others, who then become their parents?  To even imply she's doing this for her own needs and ego really proves you have NO IDEA what it takes to raise a traumatized child. It's just about the hardest thing in the world. And what difference does it make if she has bio children of her own?  or the bizarre idea that people have kids (bio or otherwise) to put a \"buffer\" between them and their spouse? That's just weird. Is that what you think EVERYONE with kids is doing? I don't even believe that you know young adults harmed by this - it sounds like you are saying they are worse off to be in a loving, stable home.", "Seriously.  If they are so interested why aren't they the ones being mistaken for mommy? NTA. \nMy oldest child is actually my niece by birth, she is the child of my soul.  I am the mother of hers. Her child calls me Grammy and has never met his maternal bio grandparents.", "Seriously. Taking on four kids that are not your own is a huge commitment, and not one that many people would be prepared to take on. Jen's family should be grateful that someone is able to provide them with the stable home that Jen can't.", "If her rights get terminated and you can adopt her, work on getting restraining order against her. Trust me. \n\nAlso, be honest with the kids in an age-appropriate way why she can\u2019t see them anymore. It will be long better in the long run for them to grow up with the information and will help in case any of her family tries to turn them against you.", "I'd ask their social worker at what point the courts will terminate the mother's parental rights.

You just hit their sore spot.", "If they have to be separated during supervised visitation that she barely attends and they do it for their safety... I don't think Jen will ever get those kids back", "That might very well be up to the courts to decide, not the OP. I've seen many cases where parents lose all visitation rights, for good reason.", "We already have a court date for her rights to be terminated. She's fighting it but there's a very good chance we'll be able to adopt them within the next year.", "But you can't come down hard on them, especially not the little one. I kind of like \"Auntie-Mommy\" and you can probably work with that.", "I agree. Courts know who has the issues", "That is scary indeed. Also a part of the taking care. Her children are in danger with her.", "I wish you, your husband and the kids all the best. May you give these children the love and stability they need. Maybe in time Jen will get her life together and be able to establish a positive relationship with them, but the priority is the little ones and their ability to feel safe and cared for.", "In some countries parental rights can never be completely terminated. Because the door shouldn\u2019t be shut on parents if they suitably recover. It\u2019s not considered best practice anymore. \n\nIn Australia there are only dozens adopted every year - there is long term fostering but to completely cut off parental involvement forever is not considered the best option for the welfare of the children. Most adoptees or otherwise abandoned children will seek out their biological parents once of age. And it has occurred where the parents have been quite fine for some years and have been prevented from establishing contact and the ramifications for the child and their relationship with their adopted families have suffered greatly. It takes a lot of awareness around trauma to get. I understand it sounds bad. In the next few decades there will be more and more movement towards that model.", "Children call people whatever they want. For young kids in particular, calling people mum or dad is more about the role those names have, rather than the people. Mothers are nurturing, caring, attentive, tend to children's needs, other people can fill that role also, not just a biological parent. \n\nI used to work in the nursery at a preschool not long ago, I've been called mum plenty of times by 2 year olds. Nothing forced, nothing coerced, just a word that they associate with people who take care of them.\n\nThe 2 year old associates OP with a motherly role in her life, her life would be an absolute mess without OP. There's nothing wrong with the child, or any of the children, calling OP mum, that is the role she has with them.", "None of them are my brother's.", "I have a different pov with this situation.  I was a foster kid that was eventually adopted and personally I do not think you should let her call you mom because really anything can happen still. Mom could get her shit together and get custody back, the foster agency could place them somewhere else. When dealing with foster care nothing is permanent.  Allowing her to call you mom  as her foster mother might make you feel good but ultimately it\u2019s not what\u2019s best for the child. If you were adopting her that\u2019s different then it is a permanent thing but right now no and if you continue to allow it then you are absolutely the asshole", "Check the comment history. They\u2019re trying to make it permanent. They WANT it to be permanent. Even when the kids are with Jen, they\u2019re STILL spending a lot of nights with OP. \n\nWhat you\u2019re saying 100% makes sense, but this is a situation where OP wants to raise these kids, and the kids want to be with OP. Their bio mom physically attacks them, and is refusing treatment. Reunification at that level of dysfunction while the children are under 18 seems like it would do more harm than good. I think the best person to give an opinion would be a therapist that specializes in these things; every situation is different.\n\nEdit: OP got the opinion from a doctor that she should remain the primary caretaker. I hope that happens for them. I hope Jen can reenter their lives safely down the line. Right now, what\u2019s most important is the mental health of the kids. The toddler is 2, she\u2019s raised this child for 2/3s of her life, OP is the only mom she\u2019s truly known. It would be downright cruel to the 2 y/o to be told that the one who feeds her, clothes her, keeps her safe, and she WANTS to call mommy doesn\u2019t want to be called mommy; it\u2019s an intense and painful rejection. OP is NTA."]}
