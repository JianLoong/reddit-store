It\u2019s not surprising that the youngest one sees you as more of a mother. \n\nAllowing her to call you mommy is acknowledging her feelings and wants. \n\nUnless you\u2019ve been coaching her to call you mommy, NTA.", "NTA.\nIf you've had the kids since September, that's five months. That's nearly a quarter of the 2yo life. I'm not surprised she sees you as mommy.\n\nYou aren't stealing her kids. If she were capable of taking care of them properly, they would be with her.\n\nYou can try to correct the kids. You could come up with another name they could call you. You can remind them that they have a mommy who is very sick. But you can't come down hard on them, especially not the little one. I kind of like \"Auntie-Mommy\" and you can probably work with that.", "NTA. If she wanted to be the one getting called Mommy, then she should have stepped up to the plate.", "NTA - You are the one providing them with stability and a safe place to live and grow up. The kids should be the one to decide who is given the title of Mum/Dad, and it is pretty clear that they feel you are the one worthy of this title. \n\nIt is unfortunate, but if Jen wants to be granted that title, she needs to embody a mother, and that just isn't the case right now.", "NTA\n\n>still crying and asking for her mommy and everyone figured out who she was talking about\n\nIf this is how they view you then who is to argue with them? The kids are the ones who dictate that not other people.", "NTA\n\nThe kids are calling you mommy because, to them, you are.  **You are their mother in every single way except biology.**  \n\nTo a kid, mommy is the woman who is the most significant person in their life.

Think about this for a minute.\n\n**The kids see Jen so little they're afraid of her.**  \n\nIf Jen's family is all upset over this, they should have **made** Jen get treatment and take her meds so she could keep the kids.

I hate when people scream and yell at someone **else** to do something, but **they** have done nothing to help the situation.", "NTA - Honestly, I believe \u201cmommy\u201d is an earned title. And *you earned it.* Those kids identify you as mommy because that\u2019s who you\u2019ve been to them. You give them love and a safe home. She is not their mommy just because she gave birth to them. She kind of forfeited that right by refusing treatment. I feel for her and hope she gets the help she needs, that she can only get when she herself accepts it, but her actions had consequences. And one of those consequences is that she is no longer mommy to these kids. You are.\n\nAnd to be fair, her seeing the kids completely disconnect from her and not see her as mommy anymore might be *good* for her.

And I STRINGLY, HIGHLY encourage you to report how frightening and threatening these visits are for the kids. If they're afraid of these visits AND at risk during them, the visits need to stop until Jen actually completes treatment for her issues and makes a radical change.

I read an article about fostering little ones and once they get to that age of saying mama and papa it's to whoever is taking care of them. They encouraged the foster parents to move forward with it and not stop it, since it relates to the kids security.", "NTA\n\nIt takes maturity to recognize the human heart is quite capable of loving more than one mother figure. I'm sure her bio is upset and feels her recognition slipping away. That's on her because of her choices.\n\nI would still recommend counseling for the children because of trauma. They click off enough to score higher on an ACES, or similar, evaluation.", "NTA. It appears that you've been their stable mother figure. A position Jen has repeatedly messed up. It's not your fault for stepping up in those children's lives.\n\nThose kids are lucky to have you and your husband. \n\nDon't let the people that don't fully understand all that you've done for these kids dictate how you should or shouldn't act with them.   \nJust keep acting in their best interest as much as you can. Those kids will be better for it.", "NTA To kids, \u201cmommy\u201d is a person who loves, nurtures, cuddles, and supports a kid. It\u2019s not a person who gives birth to a kid.

It looks like you are it. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  You can be the birth mother and not be \"mommy.\"  Men and women can make babies easily but being a parent is an altogether different proposition.  Once a \"parent\" gets to the point they have to have supervised visits, somebody else has to step up which you have done.  Jen is lucky they have you and are not in foster care somewhere.\n\nAdvice:  Spend time loving those kids and waste no time on telling them not to call you \"Mommy\" if that's what they choose to do.", "NTA, you didn't train them to call you mommy,  you are just the only mommy they have ever actually had.  Instead of being mad about that, she should be embarrassed that she isn't that to them.", "I'm probably gunna get some shit for this but NTA\n\nthose kids deserve a stable environment and people to call parents. every kid does unfortunately not everyone who can have kids should.\n\nthis situation is entirely your SIL's doing and can only blame herself for failing her children.\n\nme and my wife are raising her nieces taken into care from her younger sister, its permanent and she's had at least 2 more kids who we couldn't take on unfortunately. has she seen the girls even once in the ten years they've lived with us despite living ten minutes from her parents house where she currently lives.\n\nshe got in touch a few months ago demanding contact and how HER daughters love her more than anything....\n\nthey are MY daughters.

Ive been through stuff like this and my little bro is convinced my aunt is his mom because she encouraged him to call her \u201cmomma\u201d. \n\nIf you end up with the kids permanently then honestly I don\u2019t see a problem at all", "NAH. You didn't tell the children to call you mommy.  And, I can see why the mother got upset and other family members got involved (they might be the only AHs here - accusations of trying to steal the children are dramatic and untoward). The mother is struggling with a lot and having her kids reject her like that and call someone else mommy has to elicit a lot of pain and shame. That's not your fault, but it does require you to make a decision going forward. \n\nShe is still their mother and she's still trying. Yes, she's failing, too, but that's to be expected given her situation. A gentle reminder that she is indeed their mother is appropriate. They can still love you, bond with you and acknowledge the active (though problematic) relationship they have with the woman who gave them life.", "NTA but I think you should very gently remind your children that they have another mother, even when she's not in a place to care for them. \n\nI would not keep them from calling you whatever they want and it's wonderful they feel so accepted by you and your husband!! I am only saying this because it's important for the kids to be open and honest about the situation. \n\nIt will help them understand what happened to them and it's important to have those conversations from a time they're very young so that they grow up with it being normal and not something they can't ask questions or talk about.", "INFO: What do these interactions with the kids look like? Have you gently told them that you aren't their mother, but their aunt? If you have done that and they call you \"mommy\" anyway, I think you're right not to push it.\n\nIf you instruct them to call you \"mommy\" or you haven't attempted to gently redirect them once or twice, then maybe I'd be more inclined to agree with your SIL. But if you are simply allowing the children to do what comes naturally to them, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Especially since you are the one who brings stability in their lives.", "NTA but you need to instill the boundaries of aunt vs mother with the kids. Their mother may suck but that is their mother and you are their aunt. Unless you legally adopt them, that's the way it is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
