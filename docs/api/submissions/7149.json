When my husband\u2018s father asked about honeymoon plans, we told him we were trying to plan something after the wedding, in late April or early May. We told him we were saving my PTO (10 days per year) to take one big trip for the year (our honeymoon) this year. We also bought a house last year, so between wedding planning and moving, we haven\u2019t really gotten around to actually booking the tickets for the honeymoon yet. My father-in-law floated the idea of having the whole family go to Hawaii this year, but we explicitly told him that we would not be able to make that trip because we were planning our honeymoon and we couldn\u2019t do both in the same year.\n\nThen two weeks ago, my father-in-law tells us that he has booked an all inclusive paid vacation for us, my sister-in-law and her husband and kids, his other sister, father-in-law\u2018s girlfriend, girlfriends daughter, son, and their partners\u2014 everyone in my husband\u2018s family is going on this trip, which is paid for entirely by my father-in-law. Then both his father and sister started asking and pressuring us to join this trip.\n\nI know that a free trip to Hawaii sounds like an ideal situation, but the trip is in mid-April of this year. I really wanted to use my PTO for my husband and I to go abroad for two weeks. If we go to Hawaii, I\u2019ll either have to reschedule honeymoon, possibly for next year, which is upsetting in itself because I feel like my honeymoon has been hijacked by a trip I can\u2019t say no to, or will have to cut the honeymoon short in order to do both this year. \n\nAt first I told my husband I was mad that his dad is planning this trip, and guilt tripping us into going, knowing for almost a year that this is the same timeframe we were planning our honeymoon for. My husband said he didn\u2019t want to go without me, and so hesitantly I have agreed to go because I don\u2019t want to be the reason he misses a trip of a lifetime with his family. But internally I\u2019m still pissed that I feel like my honeymoon got hijacked. I don\u2019t want to be a brat\u2014 I recognize that this is an amazing opportunity. But I really wanted to go on my honeymoon with my husband, not my husband and his entire family. I wish I could be excited about the Hawaii trip, but I just feel disappointed that my father-in-law planned this trip when he knew we were planning a honeymoon, and then got everyone in the family on board so we\u2019d have to say yes, or end up being the assholes by missing it.\n\n My husband has been supportive, but my friends have told me that my anger about this is misplaced and that I would be an asshole for refusing to change our honeymoon plans and missing the Hawaii trip with my husband and his family.

It isn't your fault that FIL wasted his money, he was warned you guys couldn't go and did it anyway. He purposefully bought the tickets as a power play.  If you give in now and delay your honeymoon, this will keep happening.\n\nYou could also reverse it on him. Thank him for paying for your hotel and honeymoon trip, but you guys will probably be too busy to leave the bedroom. You won't be joining them for family outings.", "NTA \n\nThere's no way I would give in; your FIL is an AH for ignoring your explicit wishes by involuntarily including you.  It's a power play demonstrating his wishes are more important than yours and that he can buy your compliance.", "NTA\n\nYou were guilted into a trip you don't want to take. Stick to your guns. Don't go, plan your own holiday.", "NTA because it sounds like he did it on purpose. Honestly though I think you should talk with your husband and see if he will agree to make sure to do a lot of things as only the two of you. You can still have a romantic time and fil will pay for it. Then you can roll your vacation budget into next year and have an even better trip than you would have been able to afford this year.", "NTA. I'd make sure your husband understands that this will fully hijack your honeymoon and now next year's trip is just gonna be a trip. And once he knows that's how you are gonna feel about it let him decide if you are still going. Cause you won't be able to change how you feel. You won't be able to sike yourself up the same way or have the same enthusiasm planning and going on that trip now. And if you do the whole \"it will still be our honeymoon\" and then don't have that same excitement planning it as you had the first time, he's probably gonna notice.", "NTA\n\nYour FIL was told before you would not be able to go. Also, good relationships do not include guilt tripping.", "NTA\n\nYour pushy FIL overstepped his boundaries, weaponizing generosity and the promise of fun to get his way. He knew what your plan was, the reasons, he didn\u2019t care. You are married to his son, you need to exert your own authority over your marriage. Don\u2019t go. If you go, this will set the precedent that what your FIL says is default and overrides what you want. Your plans matter, but to make them matter you have to assert yourself. I have a feeling you\u2019ll have to assert yourself a lot with your in-laws. Best get practicing now before you bring kids into it.", "NTA, you made your timeframes clear to FIL and he disregarded them for whatever reasons (other than being a massive AH). It would be more than reasonable for you tell tell him where to stick it.\n\nReally I think you have three options to consider: Either you both don't go, your husband goes, or you both go. All have their issues and I think only a change of perspective will make you truly happy with one of them.\n\nIf you both don't go and instead go ahead and book your honeymoon (either for the same time or whenever around the time), will you enjoy it as much as you'd hoped? Will it cause an issue between you and your new husband? You're well within your rights to do this and FIL would just have to suck it up and next time might actually listen to you. Your anger about the situation isn't just going to go away and his actions appear to suggest he hasn't considered you both when booking this holiday.\n\nIf just your husband goes, will you resent him being away without you? Then will that sour the honeymoon? You'd have to be quite secure (and maybe a saint) not to be pissed that he'd be off enjoying the holiday of a lifetime without you, so maybe this is the worst option?\n\nIf you both go, will you end up being miserable the whole time because you'll be thinking about your honeymoon? Could you use the time in Hawaii as a pre-honeymoon and book some trips just you and your husband? Just because you're on holiday with them, doesn't mean you have to spend every second with them. Could you catch a flight from Hawaii to wherever you wanted to go on your honeymoon, so do a week there and a week for the honeymoon? These are compromises, but a Hawaii trip isn't the worst thing to compromise over.\n\nPersonally, if your FIL is paying for everything involved with the Hawaii trip I'd be inclined to go, but make sure you have some alone time without the family (but then I'm a sucker for a freebie). Could you view it as two holidays for the price of one when you came to book the honeymoon?", "You are entitled to your feelings, you get to feel upset because the plans you had now need to be rearranged. \n\nNtA for that reason.\n\nHowever, glass half full, you van still have a honeymoon with family there, you just take alone time for just the 2 of you. And now you can save up extra to upgrade your honeymoon plans.", "Who in the world thinks it's okay to make a HONEYMOON a family affair? \n\nI wouldn't go if it was free *and* they paid me. Do you seriously want all those romantic honeymoon dinners, lazy lie-ins, breakfasts on the terrace, long walks...to turn into dozen-people boat excursions, group jet-skiing, group hikes, and every meal to be at a huge table with *children*. Do you think you'll be able to make your own schedule ever? Get alone time? \n\nYou literally saw all these people a MONTH ago. Why do you have to see the entire CLAN again in 4 months? \n\nThis is beyond ridiculous. Honeymoons are for the married couple. Period.\n\nNTA", "NTA but u have a husband problem. This is going to be the rest of your life if you give in to this.", "INFO: Why can\u2019t the people involved all get together in person or on a Zoom call and work this out like adults?", "NTA. You specifically told FIL that you were saving your PTO for honeymoon around that time and he planned the trip right around then and just ignored what you said. On the other hand, as frustrating and disappointing as it is, you can always plan a honeymoon next year, who says the honeymoon has to be right after the wedding?", "NTA \n\nYou told your FIL you can\u2019t go this year. He still booked it to guilt you into doing what he wants. \n\nWill you and husband have private accommodations, or will you be rooming with everyone else? \n\nIf you do go, remember that you are not joined at the hip. The two of you can set your own agenda and do what you want.", "NTA. You already said you were saving your PTO for your honeymoon so didn\u2019t want to go on a trip with all the family. Then he went and booked you on it anyway? He\u2019s the AH for not considering you want a honeymoon with just your husband (crazy I know!)\nAnd totally not related but I have to ask, only 10 days PTO a year!?! What? That\u2019s awful. We get minimum 28 days (for full time) a year here. I get 33 and it still doesn\u2019t feel enough! I couldn\u2019t cope with just 10\n\nEdited for spelling", "NTA - FIL overstepping boundaries on this one", "NTA.   Your feelings are valid and you have every right to be upset.   Your in-laws are the AH's for putting you in this situation. \n\nMy suggestion is to try to put all your anger and hard feelings aside and do your best to enjoy this free trip.   I hope your husband can express to his parents that while you are grateful for the trip,  you both are sad that your honeymoon will have to wait another year, and traveling with family is not the same as romantic honeymoon for 2.  Save your money and perhaps  next year you can go to Paris. \n\nWhile on this vacation,  make sure you spend a lot of time just the 2 of you.  Don't let them pressure you into doing too many group activities.   Have a positive attitude and have a great time. \n\nCongratulations and good luck.", "I never thought I'd say this about someone who paid for an all-expenses trip to Hawaii, but your FIL is a massive asshole. You are NTA at all.\n\nYou were very clear that you were not interested in a trip with the family, and for very good reason. He stomped all over that. \n\nAs far as what to do? I have no clue, but you're not wrong no matter what you decide as long as you and your husband are on the same page.\n\nI would be tempted to go to Hawaii, but book a room at an undisclosed other hotel for at least half the trip so you and your husband can be alone and do your own thing (because hey, free flights to Hawaii!).  But that's me - like I said, no matter what you decide you are completely not an asshole here.", "NTA\n\nWhy don't you look into getting your own place to stay in Hawaii for part or all of the vacation? \n\nThat way, you and your husband have the option to do your own thing as newlyweds where family members won't need noice canceling headphones and then you can choose when to spend time with the family plus avoid being made into impromptu babysitters during the holiday for the nibblings.", "Can you create private time while there? Like go for 3 days to another place by yourselves? Compromise? Then do a totally private honeymoon next year?", "NTA, but I would recommend going to Hawaii this year with the caveat that your REAL honeymoon will be later.  \n\nYour in-laws probably view this (especially if they are paying for it) as them helping you take your honeymoon.  It's clueless, but kind.  \"Now you don't have to worry about paying for it!\"  \n\nMy husband and I are going to Hawaii for our honeymoon this year...  And our 19th anniversary.  We were beyond broke when we got married so our initial honeymoon was a weekend at a kitschy hotel.  But we both agreed it wasn't a real honeymoon.    \n\n\nSmile, take the free vacation, and save money and time for an even better vacation.  Your husband will be happy, your in-laws will be happy, and you'll even get a tropical vacation out of it while planning an even better honeymoon.", ">my husband\u2018s father asked about honeymoon plans, we told him we were trying to plan something after the wedding, in late April or early May.

Not the point of the post, but it needed to be said. The US needs to catch up with Europe on this.\n\nYour FIL knew when you were planning your PTO for, knew you couldn't do both and knew that you were intending on having your honeymoon then. He completely ignored what you said and has now pitted you against everyone else, so if you say no and stick to your plan, you look like the bad guy.\n\nNTA\n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting to go on your honeymoon, and the fact that your FIL booked a trip and paid in advance is a power move. If you go, he knows he's manipulated you into skipping your honeymoon. If you don't go, you'll be the person that prevented your husband from going on a family holiday to Hawaii. Unless you had already booked your honeymoon, he's got you over a barrel here. And he knows it.\n\nThat, or he forgot and genuinely thinks he's doing something good, without considering the ramifications of doing this. Not everyone has malicious intentions, which I forget on here sometimes. Could be he sees it as helping with you both getting a good honeymoon?\n\nEither way, you're not an asshole, and he may or not be an asshole, depending on his intent. I hope you and your husband have a great time, whether you go on this trip or elsewhere.", "NTA however, I would try to take a step back and reframe your honeymoon in your mind. As you have not taken the trip immediately after your wedding\u2026your honeymoon can be exactly when you decide it is. You can happily go on the free family trip to Hawaii and have an additional year to save money for your honeymoon the following year\u2026.continue to refer to it as your honeymoon. We couldn\u2019t afford the trip that we wanted immediately after our wedding so we waited 4 years to go on our honeymoon and ended up having a 5 week trip to South Africa which was amazing and most definitely was our honeymoon.", "While it appears the general consensus is not to go, there are reasons to go.\n\nIt\u2019s a one in a lifetime opportunity.\n\nBecause your FIL is an ass, doesn\u2019t mean the whole family is.\n\nLife can change in a moment.  An absolute moment.  You could end up regretting it, and dealing with repercussions for many years.\n\nThat being said, make sure this is the last time for manipulation.  Shake off the pissedoffedness and tell the husband you want the best honeymoon in existence for next year.", "You are NTA. FIL maybe a little. The real problem here is both trips sound amazing and you should be able to take them. 10 days PTO is absolute BS and is  not something we should have to deal with. You are actually contemplating giving up an experience of a lifetime because of your job! We are so accustomed to feeling like our jobs own us that we forget we are on earth to LIVE. Go Live! You will regret missing either", "NTA - youre an adult and can use your pto and travel how you want. If you want to use that for a honeymoon this year, thats fine. Your FIL is a jerk for planning this trip against your wishes. \n\nWith that said - it is a free trip to hawaii\u2026.

You may very well you husband feels the same way you do.", "NTA, but your FIL seems controlling - booking a holiday for people after they already said no? Doesn't matter that he's paying, it ain't a gift when you don't want it", "Personal opinion is that FIL planned this family trip as kind of a honeymoon for you and DH, he just included the whole family as not to leave any other of his kids out. I honestly don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing it maliciously or anything. It might not be the honeymoon that you had in mind, but couldn\u2019t you make it work? Of that week, couldn\u2019t you and DH plan to have day 2-3 days of complete alone time to do what you to want together? Then spend the rest of the trip with the family? You\u2019re NTA by any means, and I completely understand your feelings! But it seems FIL is trying to gift you a trip as a honeymoon because he knows you and DH haven\u2019t had one and are trying to save for one. Unless there\u2019s some bad blood between you and the in-laws that isn\u2019t included here. Just some food for thought!", "YTA.  Take the free trip lady.

And make sure your husband tells your FIL that at the end of the Hawaii trip.\n\nThen, when your FIL pulls this again next year, you won't feel guilty about depriving hubby of another family trip, since he already got one this year.\n\nAnd, if your FIL really is a controlling asshole, when you turn down his trip next year, he'll stop inviting you on trips altogether. Which means you won't have this particular problem going forward.", "Im going to say NAH- I see what you want and value is the honeymoon but it seems your husband also values this trip highly. Your FIL is slightly a A-hole for doing this but I\u2019m going to benefit of doubt him as someone who seems to make/have enough money that he doesn\u2019t understand your limited PTO. I would tell you as a married person there are compromises we all have to make and sometimes don\u2019t want to to make our partners happy. If you could discuss this with him and let him know how you feel about it to move past your resentment ghat would help you enjoy a free trip better maybe try that. Then plan the best honeymoon you can. Best wishes on the trips and your future married life.", "NTA but make this trip revolve around you and your husband! Hawaii is gorgeous and romantic. You certainly don\u2019t have to be hanging out with his family the whole time. Make your husband pick two dinners with them and spend the rest by yourselves. Pick one or two days to hang with them and spend the rest by yourselves! Definitely get your own rental car, not sure how people travel to Hawaii without one. There are so many beaches, hikes, restaurants, bars, etc to see. Plan some exciting excursions and practice saying \u201cno\u201d when they try to get you to do everything they want to do. Then start planning your \u201choneymoon\u201d for next year!", "NTA \n\nPull out and have a talk w your husband about boundaries with his family and priorities.", "NAH. You just won the fricking vacation lottery!! Go on the Hawaii trip, it's a great opportunity for an awesome, paid-for vacation.  You can do your special honeymoon trip next year.   Looking back, the TIMING of your honeymoon really doesn't matter - the trip is special because it's the two of you, together, celebrating each other. Seriously, if someone offers you a significant FREE vacation - grab it with both hands! This is a great opportunity for the BOTH of you, you just have to let go of your tunnel vision about this year being the honeymoon trip, and relax about it. It doesn't have to be one or the other, YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL!!! Just adjust your mindset and grab that golden opportunity.", "Redditors hate controlling in laws, and your fil is being controlling so I see why the consensus is n t a. But I also feel crazy reading these comments. If you set aside your resentment, you are looking at a free luxury trip with the man you love and the family that he loves and then another trip the next year just the two of you. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to of course and if it feels super important symbolically not to go then don\u2019t go. But it feels a little absurd to not just enjoy a life that is offering you multiple opportunities to travel. \n\nInitially I thought maybe you don\u2019t want to visit Hawaii because they\u2019re literally begging people not to come there but that\u2019s not the issue. Lol", "NTA. Your FIL probably thinks he's doing you a favour. Also - they are your family too now...   \nI get that a holiday with Hubs is not the same as a honeymoon.... but it will still be special later on. <3 Trust me, it took us a few years to finally take our honeymoon and it was still amazing :)", "Can you and you\u2019re DH take 2-3 days while in Hawaii to go somewhere by yourself?

You explicitly told FIL you want your honeymoon NOT a family trip, and he did it anyway RIGHT when you would be taking your honehmoon.\n\nYou should stick to your boundaries.

You say your husband is supportive but he's guilting you into giving up your honeymoon. Why doesn't he want his honeymoon. He isn't really being supportive if he's going along with this.", "NTA\n\nThis is a power play by your FIL. He gets to coerce his son one more time and impress his girlfriend.\n\nBut you're right, it would be churlish refuse an all expenses paid vacation to Hawaii. You can reschedule your honeymoon to next year. \n\nI'm really hoping that he's reserved  the honeymoon suite for you both as a nice surprise and that they'll leave you two alone most of the time.

If a gift is forced upon you, and inconveniences plans you already made and were excited about, then it\u2019s okay to be disappointed by the gift.

This is a questions that really needs an answer.", "OP, of course you're NTA. \n\nMan... I don't envy this decision. I completely understand how difficult this must be. I'd be absolutely torn myself. I sprung a honeymoon trip onto my husband...\n\nAbout a week or so after my husband and I got married (Jan. 10, 2009), I planned a surprise honeymoon to the US Caribbean Island of St. Croix. He had NO IDEA that it had been planned. At least not until about 2 weeks before we left (May 12, 2009 is when we left for our 5 day, 4 night honeymoon). We worked together and I was in charge of payroll. So, I slotted the time with our boss and told him that he needed to keep quiet about it. \n\nTwo weeks before we left, we got into a small argument about me changing my name on my license \\[I had already booked our trip, long before in my maiden name\\], because I said that I couldn't change my license yet. \n\nHe thought it was something nefarious and it was the opposite of that. He wouldn't let it go, so I ended up throwing the itinerary at him. It took him a few minutes to \"get it.\" Then asked, \"Where the hell is St. Croix\"? When I told him, he cried and then asked, \"Well, what about the pets, a babysitter...\" I told him EVERYTHING was handled and done... even all of the packing. Then, he apologized for ruining the surprise and said, \"No one has ever done anything like this for me.\" \n\nI couldn't imagine if someone offered us a free trip to Hawaii for the same time-frame!!! That would be a REALLY difficult decision.", "NTA, but hear me out, it's a free trip to Hawaii. \n\nI don't understand your anger because 1) it's already been a month since your wedding and you were planning for more months out, so what does a few more months delay really mean? and 2) you didn't have anything actually planned or bought.\n\nI could completely understand if you had plane tickets to Italy or at least a solid plan of where and when you were going that your family knew about and they made this trip at the same time. That's a real dick move. But you have nothing. Delay your honeymoon and take the free trip.", "NTA. You're in a no-win game. Anyway, you could save the money and do unpaid time off to cover yourself for the honeymoon. Let it go. Don't let it ruin the future. Make clear it won't happen again.", "NTA.  I would go on the trip, but here me out:\n1. It\u2019s fully paid.  Save up your money to on an even nicer trip for next year.\n2. Book a couple day trips for just the two of you.\n3. The above would be a great compromise for everyone.", "I read that list of people invited and that sounds like a nightmare. Good luck. NTA.", "Nta, do your honeymoon. If you can\u2019t back out of the trip - do your own thing like it would be just the two of you", "NTA. And it's not to late to back out!", "Info - can you take unpaid leave from work? So you can have both trips? At least this way you\u2019d get a free Hawaii trip AND a honeymoon in the same year.", "You\u2019re NTA at all. However imo you should go to Hawaii with your partner. It\u2019s one in a lifetime opportunity (unless you\u2019re rich which isn\u2019t very unlikely) so just take it and make the most out of it. You have a new house so you can\u2019t absolutely rock it there when it comes to the other stuff. I would personally go, and also take a weekend with husband as a short honeymoon and go to an even bigger one the next year. Your father in law is the AH but I guess make the most out of the situation that\u2019s my advice", "NTA, but I agree that I would probably go and let your husband have this trip with his family.  Doesn't sound like they do this alot.  Do you have to go the entire time the family is there?  I couldn't tell how long the Hawaii trip was, but could you compromise and just go for a few days, and still be able to take off for your honeymoon?  If you had your honeymoon trip booked already, then that might be different.  I would be more inclined to just use the excuse, sorry, I don't have enough days off for the Hawaii trip and we already had our honeymoon booked, but it doesn't sound like anything had been set yet.\n\nIf you do the Hawaii trip, I know it's not the honeymoon, but maybe some of the days you and your husband could just plan an excursion just for the 2 of you to go off by yourself?  It could be a mini honeymoon until the real one takes place.\n\nI agree it's not right how the FIL did it, but not many people get a free trip with their whole family all together like that, so I would probably try to compromise this time.", "NTA. Send your husband without you and save your PTO. (Since it seems like you get less PTO than your husband.) Or take the time unpaid if you can afford it.", "Nta start saving for honeymoon  TELL NO ONE on hubs's family until you're heading to the airport", "NTA. It\u2019s an incredibly generous offer, but I get wanting to take a honeymoon with just your husband. This makes me think of season 1 of The White Lotus when Shane\u2019s mom joins them on their honeymoon in Hawaii.", "You\u2019re friends are right with their advice.  Not the asshole for being upset but you would be in you acted on it.  It\u2019s not a hill worth dying on to drive a wedge in your relationship with your in laws so early in the marriage.  Smile and go.", "NTA as its your honeymoon and you and your husband should get to do what you want to especially as you have such a small amount of time off.\n\nHowever i can sort of see the FILs point of view too.  If they want to have a big family holiday should they wait another year just because of two people?  Especially if those people haven't booked the honeymoon yet?  \n\nIts a difficult one as i think both of you are NTA but for different reasons.", "NTA\n\nNot for being upset, but yeah I think you would for not going on the trip and having a wonderful time. I get you wanted to plan your honeymoon with your husband, and it's disappointing to have to postpone that. \n\nWhy not take several days of the trip to go to a nearby island, just the two of you. It could serve as a kind of mini-honeymoon and would be a lot cheaper than paying for one in Hawaii.", "I actually love this idea lol", "That\u2019s exactly what this feels like. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "And if OP and husband do go. HONEYMOON SEX. Loud and raucous. Make it weird.", "That was my initial reaction, but my husband looked so sad when he saw how pissed I was and that we couldn\u2019t go to Hawaii when his whole family was going. I totally understand that he doesn\u2019t want to be the only one left out, and I would feel terrible for being the person that held him back from this trip. I\u2019m not mad at my husband, I\u2019m pissed at my father-in-law for planning a trip we can\u2019t say no to without feeling like jerks.", "Exactly.  This isn\u2019t a bite the bullet situation.  Your FIL may have meant well, but he obviously was aware of your plans and his actions are very self serving.  This isn\u2019t the best of both worlds because honeymoons are not family affairs.  \n\nI never went on a honeymoon because we had just bought a house and I was out of PTO.  We talked about waiting a year, but life gets in the way and 15 years in we still haven\u2019t managed to make it happen.\n\nThink of it this way, whatever trip you take in April is going to be your honeymoon.  Assume that you won\u2019t have another opportunity.  Are you ok with spending your honeymoon this way?", "This comment is so insightful. The next trip won't feel like a honeymoon and you deserve that feeling!", "I know, this was my first reaction to. Put my foot down and firmly say no on the grounds that we\u2019ve already said no and they chose to plan it anyway. I\u2019m not going for my father-in-law, I\u2019m going for my husband so that he can spend his time in an amazing place with his family. If my husband was even slightly on the fence about wanting to go, there\u2019s absolutely no way in hell we\u2019d be going.", "But will they be able to take any alone time? I'd wonder what the itinerary will be and who is making that. Is every day gonna be filled with family activities, family meals, etc that the honeymooning couple are expected to participate in.", "We did, and we told them this isn\u2019t the year we can go to Hawaii with them. My father-in-law didn\u2019t want to hear that and went a head and booked it anyway. I get that he can travel whenever he wants, I just feel pissed that he chose to plan this trip the same time we were planning our honeymoon, and now expects us to push our honeymoon off to go to Hawaii with him and the family.", "I agree with you that this is totally the attitude to have. I\u2019m just struggling with my disappointment over the honeymoon, but I know we\u2019ll take another one. I think Hawaii will be amazing, and I don\u2019t want to paint my father-in-law has some jerk, he\u2019s actually a really nice guy. I just think he can be thoughtless about how he\u2019s affecting other people sometimes, and when he gets an idea and decides he wants to do something, he doesn\u2019t take other people into account very well.", "I think this is what we\u2019re planning to do, I just feel disappointed \ud83d\ude23", "I think he does feel the same way, but he also loves his family (and I do too, most of the time lol) and I know he\u2019ll be so sad and hurt to miss this trip with them. I feel we\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place.", "To be fair, he booked flights and accommodations for everyone except for us after we told him no, and then started pressuring us into going once he\u2019d already booked EVERYONE else flights and hotels. He used the fact that he had booked for everyone else and there were time constraints on us making a decision to go as a way to pressure us into saying yes, after we\u2019d told him no repeatedly. My husband was sad That everyone else was going and we were not, so I caved and said yes to the trip since I didn\u2019t have flights or hotels booked yet for our honeymoon, so I didn\u2019t have much of an argument to make with my father-in-law once he got the family on board and started putting the screws to us.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to book it as a honeymoon, but I think you\u2019re right that he\u2019s not trying to be malicious. He\u2019s just doing what he wants to do, which is kind of his MO. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s trying to prevent us from going on a honeymoon, he\u2019s just being entirely inconsiderate that, like, we don\u2019t want to go on our honeymoon\u2026 with his family, and now we feel like we\u2019ve been pigeonholed into doing it.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to book it as a honeymoon, but I think you\u2019re right that he\u2019s not trying to be malicious.

It\u2019s just disappointing that we don\u2019t get the whole honeymoon experience of flying out together and drinking champagne on a plane, having rose petals in our room, all the traditional honeymoon stuff. I\u2019m gonna try to make the best of the trip, and it\u2019s not that I\u2019m not grateful for the trip, I just didn\u2019t imagine going on my honeymoon with my husbands family along for the ride.", "Yep and guilt him into paying for the honeymoon suite for you.", "Worse, it's going to set the tone for the rest of your relationship with him if you show you can be bought or manipulated.

And these trips are never truly free (PTO, etc).  The next year it was another trip gift, but not as nice, and again we had no say.  Then the following year it was the same.  It used up most of our leave and we were NEVER consulted in advance.  The fourth time we told him we couldn\u2019t make it and OMG the guilt and pressure.  Then the next year we weren\u2019t invited because we \u201churt their feelings and didn\u2019t appreciate them.\u201d  I know people who don\u2019t have this opportunity will say to quit complaining, but it was like being bullied with $$.  Anyway, NTA.", "You should tell your husband you want to go on your honeymoon as planned.

OP  described how manipulative he was when her husband was trying to move where she was going to be. The husband had to quit working for the father to get away. What are the odds that the father has turned over a new leaf?\n\nWith this many people going, it's doubtful that OP and her husband will have 'honeymoon time' unless they lay down some basic rules for being alone. There will always be some sort of' family' excursion, meal or babysitting opportunity that OP and her husband must be involved in. There will be pressure from everyone to conform to the plan (initially they were to share a place with the FIL and his girlfriend!). It's going to be harder going forward to break this chain because FIL knows that all he has to do is dangle  the notion of family in front of his son and he just folds.\n\nI hope that both OP and her husband find the backbone to stand up to this bully. Otherwise it will be a long hard marriage filled with resentment on both sides.\n\nAnd why is Hawaii seen as some exotic, once in a life time vacation venue? If you save up and go in the low season, it can be as affordable as any other vacation. OP and her husband could totally go at another time, when they wouldn't be surrounded by family.", "start your marriage the way you mean to go on - with you and your husband making decisions.  \n\nFIL is a bully and if he gets his way now, be prepared for him to continue until he finds his eternal reward.\n\nNTA", "NTA... but once you make up your mind, let it go.

It is extremely easy to 'miss' each other, to be off on an excursion for the day, to have off-property dinner reservations, etc.\n\nI get the feeling that his father wanted to do this once-in-a-lifetime trip. He just went about it in a really inconsiderate way.", "NTA\n\nDo not go to Hawaii!!!\n\nNext year will be something else.

I think your FIL went in with good intentions, I can't think of too many dad's that would want to block their son from having a honeymoon... can I ask, were you living together before? I am only asking because maybe the FIL doesn't think the \"honeymoon\" won't be about \"getting to know each other\" and you wouldn't be the blushing, na\u00efve bride that would be too embarrassed to face her in laws after just being deflowered by their son... but this is a family trip, that you have a choice of going on or not, and well, people can vacation the same year you take a honeymoon...", "op=NTA\n\nis it possible that FIL was trying to do something nice?

It's not a simple matter of \"those dates don't work for us.\" NO dates worked for the OP for a year.  Meanwhile, those dates DID work for his girlfriend, four other adult children, their partners, and grandchildren (who have school schedules).  It is not surprising that he went ahead and scheduled the trip.\n\nHe obviously wanted all his kids to come.  I think it is fair to say he pressured them.  But, by the same measure, it is fair to say that when FIL told them he wanted to take a family trip this year, and they said they could not make a trip this year, THEY were pressuring FIL not to take the trip this year.  To give up something he wants, something everyone else in the family wants, so they don't miss out on it.  That's pretty clearly what OP and her husband would have preferred.\n\nI think a lot of what people are calling manipulation is simply having different wants.  FIL wanted his kids to live near him and work at the family company.  OP wanted husband to move to her so that she could continue in her current job.  They had a choice to make as a couple and they did so.  She does not say that FIL then exploded and cut his son out of the will.  Just that he had lobbied hard for something other than what she wanted.  But ultimately, it was OP and her husband's lives, to do with what they wanted.\n\nThe same goes with this trip. FIL does not have to delay a year in hopes that next year will work out for everyone too.  He wants to do this now, so he did. And OP and her husband can decide what they want to do - delay THEIR trip for a year (like they were asking FIL to do) or miss out on the family trip.", "I wonder if you & your husband can find ways to exert a little autonomy within the context of \"family vacation\" to feel a little less beholden to your FIL and also to create more of a honeymoon feel: \n\nMaybe you only go for part of the time to save some of your PTO (e.g. Fly in on a Friday night & out on the next-next Sunday afternoon)... \nMaybe you can call the hotel directly & have your room upgraded or moved to a separate floor to be more private (or maybe they're even part of a hotel group & if you explain the situation, they could move you to a sister hotel?)... \nIf you're accused of not being a team player, explain you could only use X Amount of PTO and that you & husband were treating this as a partial-honeymoon...

That way when FIL decides to plan another family trip, you can \"apologize\" and tell him that you'd love to go, but your honeymoon has been booked for months and the reservations are nonrefundable. Even if the 2 events aren't at the same time, you've got the truth of you don't have any more PTO except sick time this year. Please update us and tell us what you and your husband decided to do.", "You said your husband really wants to go with the family. You should ask your husband why he would rather go on a family trip than on a honeymoon with just you?", "NTA, and be wary of continued manipulations by FIL going forward.", "The real villain here is the only 10 days of PTO.", "NTA. Very frustrating, but try and see a positive in this. You have an extra year to save up for an even better trip next year for your honeymoon. \n\nYou can have an amazing time in Hawaii.  You can disappear to do your own things, enjoy the sun and beach.  It's free. Let go of the anger. It wasn't done with malice. It was done out of a generous and loving heart.\n\nJust read all the horror stories about IL's on reddit to realize how lucky you are to have a lovely one. \n\nLet it go. Have fun.", "NTA but I would go on that trip since it's all paid for and then book the honeymoon for the following year.  My husband and I love traveling so for us, we'd see it as a win-win situation.  The only time I will sometimes balk about travel plans is if I'm traveling to a destination for a specific event which I do from time to time, like a concert or sporting event.  \n\nIf you really don't think you'll enjoy it at all, then don't go, life's too short to do things you don't want to do.  However, if you can use it as an opportunity to get closer to your husband's family and if your husband really wants to go, maybe consider going and have fun.  Don't be a pushover of course and allow his family to dictate everything (I don't think this is the case), but I don't know, if it was me I'd enjoy it and then look forward to going on yet another vacation the following year with just you and your husband.", "NTA. I\u2019m still pissed my mom\u2019s bf showed up on the mother-daughters visit when I was living in Hawaii. We had plans to see museums and beaches and eat delicious food and instead *everything* was scheduled around waiting for him to finish diving almost every day. I wanted to chuck him over a balcony.", ">But I\u2019m also trying to see a bigger picture here, both with my husband\u2018s happiness, and my relationship with my future in-laws.\n\nThe bigger picture here is that your feelings/wants don't matter. It's great that you care about your husband's happiness but if I were your husband and I knew how you felt, I wouldn't be happy at all. I'd feel shitty. But that's me. Maybe all he's seeing is a \"free\" trip to Hawaii. There's no guarantee that once there your FIL is going to let the 2 of you do your own thing. You said he's controlling. How far will he take it? \n\nI don't care if it's all-inclusive. He knew what he was doing and that he can guilt you into being the \"bigger person.\" That's just another phrase for \"doormat.\"", "\"OK. Well, you can save money on two tickets because we'll be on our honeymoon at that time. By ourselves. Like NORMAL newlyweds. Have fun! Bye!\"", "It's very calculated and he's betting on you caving.\n\nYou say you want your husband to be happy but will he be happy knowing you're unhappy going on this guilt trip (literally!) \n\nPresent it as others have said: What's more important? Going on a FAMILY TRIP that was purposefully planned to hijack our honeymoon? Or going on our honeymoon that you KNOW I've been looking forward to?\n\nIf he picks the Hawaiian vacation, OK. You see that he values his family of origin over the new family he's created with you.\n\nThat's a pretty shitty thing to show your new spouse. \n\nHonestly, I'd be too pissed to have sex with my husband if he chose the family trip over our honeymoon, but that's just me.", "Just curious, have you never traveled with your husband prior to marriage?  I actually took two honeymoons that were international at separate times of the same year, several months after getting married (one was a full year later) but I didn't really feel like it was anything other than traveling with my husband.  I just wonder what your expectations are that would make a honeymoon different than traveling with your husband.  Anytime my husband and I travel for leisure we eat great food, have plenty of sex, visit the sites, maybe engage in something fun like ATVs, snowmobiles, hikes, dives, etc, splurge at hotels, etc.  I'm struggling to understand what makes a honeymoon any different.", "> And my fear is that if we push off the honeymoon for a year, it won\u2019t really feel like a honeymoon\n\nIt sounds like the issue here is mainly PTO. Is it possible to take *unpaid* time off? Plenty of workplaces will let you do this but a lot of people don't think to ask. Yeah, it's a paycheck's less income, but just look at it as another expense that's part of the trip. I also know of some places that will let you go into the negative on your PTO if you want to take more time off than you have, but again, they never tell you this is an option unless you specifically ask.", "Shit, I wouldn't want to spend ANY time with the in-laws. \n\nDinner? Already booked somewhere else. Where? Sorry, I don't remember the name. \n\nFamily excursion? Sorry, we have other plans. Oh really? Like what? Oh, don't worry about it. Go enjoy your thing.\n\nGrey rock the shit out of any questions and remember: no one can physically make you do or go somewhere you don't want to go. Don't give into the guilt any more than you already have.\n\nFuck your FIL. He knows *exactly* what he's doing, and so do you. You can make it a game of - at least have some fun fucking with him while you're there: tell them one thing but do another somewhere totally different. Things like that.\n\nUltimately I hope you change your mind. But if you don't, at least make it worth your while in pettiness.", "He's actively pressuring and guilting them about it. No, it's not nice or innocent.", "Look, it seems you\u2019ve chosen to give in, if you\u2019re not going to be straight up aggressive about your dislike, then mention at dinner if we were on our honeymoon we\u2019d be at this location. Do it every single time so you make FIL just as miserable as he has made you by forcing this power play and making you move your dream honeymoon. \nDon\u2019t play nice and happy unless you truly are in that moment. Have fun where you can but make sure FIL gets the message he won\u2019t get to enjoy his family trip. Be the bridezilla you surely weren\u2019t for the wedding demand things that since it\u2019s all paid for he has to pay extra for. Make him regret this power play.", "It's not thoughtless at all. In fact, it's very calculated."]}
