When my husband\u2018s father asked about honeymoon plans, we told him we were trying to plan something after the wedding, in late April or early May. We told him we were saving my PTO (10 days per year) to take one big trip for the year (our honeymoon) this year. We also bought a house last year, so between wedding planning and moving, we haven\u2019t really gotten around to actually booking the tickets for the honeymoon yet. My father-in-law floated the idea of having the whole family go to Hawaii this year, but we explicitly told him that we would not be able to make that trip because we were planning our honeymoon and we couldn\u2019t do both in the same year.\n\nThen two weeks ago, my father-in-law tells us that he has booked an all inclusive paid vacation for us, my sister-in-law and her husband and kids, his other sister, father-in-law\u2018s girlfriend, girlfriends daughter, son, and their partners\u2014 everyone in my husband\u2018s family is going on this trip, which is paid for entirely by my father-in-law. Then both his father and sister started asking and pressuring us to join this trip.\n\nI know that a free trip to Hawaii sounds like an ideal situation, but the trip is in mid-April of this year. I really wanted to use my PTO for my husband and I to go abroad for two weeks. If we go to Hawaii, I\u2019ll either have to reschedule honeymoon, possibly for next year, which is upsetting in itself because I feel like my honeymoon has been hijacked by a trip I can\u2019t say no to, or will have to cut the honeymoon short in order to do both this year. \n\nAt first I told my husband I was mad that his dad is planning this trip, and guilt tripping us into going, knowing for almost a year that this is the same timeframe we were planning our honeymoon for. My husband said he didn\u2019t want to go without me, and so hesitantly I have agreed to go because I don\u2019t want to be the reason he misses a trip of a lifetime with his family. But internally I\u2019m still pissed that I feel like my honeymoon got hijacked. I don\u2019t want to be a brat\u2014 I recognize that this is an amazing opportunity. But I really wanted to go on my honeymoon with my husband, not my husband and his entire family. I wish I could be excited about the Hawaii trip, but I just feel disappointed that my father-in-law planned this trip when he knew we were planning a honeymoon, and then got everyone in the family on board so we\u2019d have to say yes, or end up being the assholes by missing it.\n\n My husband has been supportive, but my friends have told me that my anger about this is misplaced and that I would be an asshole for refusing to change our honeymoon plans and missing the Hawaii trip with my husband and his family.

It isn't your fault that FIL wasted his money, he was warned you guys couldn't go and did it anyway. He purposefully bought the tickets as a power play.  If you give in now and delay your honeymoon, this will keep happening.\n\nYou could also reverse it on him. Thank him for paying for your hotel and honeymoon trip, but you guys will probably be too busy to leave the bedroom. You won't be joining them for family outings.", "NTA \n\nThere's no way I would give in; your FIL is an AH for ignoring your explicit wishes by involuntarily including you.  It's a power play demonstrating his wishes are more important than yours and that he can buy your compliance.", "NTA\n\nYou were guilted into a trip you don't want to take. Stick to your guns. Don't go, plan your own holiday.", "NTA because it sounds like he did it on purpose. Honestly though I think you should talk with your husband and see if he will agree to make sure to do a lot of things as only the two of you. You can still have a romantic time and fil will pay for it. Then you can roll your vacation budget into next year and have an even better trip than you would have been able to afford this year.", "NTA. I'd make sure your husband understands that this will fully hijack your honeymoon and now next year's trip is just gonna be a trip. And once he knows that's how you are gonna feel about it let him decide if you are still going. Cause you won't be able to change how you feel. You won't be able to sike yourself up the same way or have the same enthusiasm planning and going on that trip now. And if you do the whole \"it will still be our honeymoon\" and then don't have that same excitement planning it as you had the first time, he's probably gonna notice.", "NTA\n\nYour FIL was told before you would not be able to go. Also, good relationships do not include guilt tripping.", "NTA\n\nYour pushy FIL overstepped his boundaries, weaponizing generosity and the promise of fun to get his way. He knew what your plan was, the reasons, he didn\u2019t care. You are married to his son, you need to exert your own authority over your marriage. Don\u2019t go. If you go, this will set the precedent that what your FIL says is default and overrides what you want. Your plans matter, but to make them matter you have to assert yourself. I have a feeling you\u2019ll have to assert yourself a lot with your in-laws. Best get practicing now before you bring kids into it.", "NTA, you made your timeframes clear to FIL and he disregarded them for whatever reasons (other than being a massive AH). It would be more than reasonable for you tell tell him where to stick it.\n\nReally I think you have three options to consider: Either you both don't go, your husband goes, or you both go. All have their issues and I think only a change of perspective will make you truly happy with one of them.\n\nIf you both don't go and instead go ahead and book your honeymoon (either for the same time or whenever around the time), will you enjoy it as much as you'd hoped? Will it cause an issue between you and your new husband? You're well within your rights to do this and FIL would just have to suck it up and next time might actually listen to you. Your anger about the situation isn't just going to go away and his actions appear to suggest he hasn't considered you both when booking this holiday.\n\nIf just your husband goes, will you resent him being away without you? Then will that sour the honeymoon? You'd have to be quite secure (and maybe a saint) not to be pissed that he'd be off enjoying the holiday of a lifetime without you, so maybe this is the worst option?\n\nIf you both go, will you end up being miserable the whole time because you'll be thinking about your honeymoon? Could you use the time in Hawaii as a pre-honeymoon and book some trips just you and your husband? Just because you're on holiday with them, doesn't mean you have to spend every second with them. Could you catch a flight from Hawaii to wherever you wanted to go on your honeymoon, so do a week there and a week for the honeymoon? These are compromises, but a Hawaii trip isn't the worst thing to compromise over.\n\nPersonally, if your FIL is paying for everything involved with the Hawaii trip I'd be inclined to go, but make sure you have some alone time without the family (but then I'm a sucker for a freebie). Could you view it as two holidays for the price of one when you came to book the honeymoon?", "You are entitled to your feelings, you get to feel upset because the plans you had now need to be rearranged. \n\nNtA for that reason.\n\nHowever, glass half full, you van still have a honeymoon with family there, you just take alone time for just the 2 of you. And now you can save up extra to upgrade your honeymoon plans.", "Who in the world thinks it's okay to make a HONEYMOON a family affair? \n\nI wouldn't go if it was free *and* they paid me. Do you seriously want all those romantic honeymoon dinners, lazy lie-ins, breakfasts on the terrace, long walks...to turn into dozen-people boat excursions, group jet-skiing, group hikes, and every meal to be at a huge table with *children*. Do you think you'll be able to make your own schedule ever? Get alone time? \n\nYou literally saw all these people a MONTH ago. Why do you have to see the entire CLAN again in 4 months? \n\nThis is beyond ridiculous. Honeymoons are for the married couple. Period.\n\nNTA", "NTA but u have a husband problem. This is going to be the rest of your life if you give in to this.", "INFO: Why can\u2019t the people involved all get together in person or on a Zoom call and work this out like adults?", "NTA. You specifically told FIL that you were saving your PTO for honeymoon around that time and he planned the trip right around then and just ignored what you said. On the other hand, as frustrating and disappointing as it is, you can always plan a honeymoon next year, who says the honeymoon has to be right after the wedding?", "NTA \n\nYou told your FIL you can\u2019t go this year. He still booked it to guilt you into doing what he wants. \n\nWill you and husband have private accommodations, or will you be rooming with everyone else? \n\nIf you do go, remember that you are not joined at the hip. The two of you can set your own agenda and do what you want.", "NTA. You already said you were saving your PTO for your honeymoon so didn\u2019t want to go on a trip with all the family. Then he went and booked you on it anyway? He\u2019s the AH for not considering you want a honeymoon with just your husband (crazy I know!)\nAnd totally not related but I have to ask, only 10 days PTO a year!?! What? That\u2019s awful. We get minimum 28 days (for full time) a year here. I get 33 and it still doesn\u2019t feel enough! I couldn\u2019t cope with just 10\n\nEdited for spelling", "NTA - FIL overstepping boundaries on this one", "NTA.   Your feelings are valid and you have every right to be upset.   Your in-laws are the AH's for putting you in this situation. \n\nMy suggestion is to try to put all your anger and hard feelings aside and do your best to enjoy this free trip.   I hope your husband can express to his parents that while you are grateful for the trip,  you both are sad that your honeymoon will have to wait another year, and traveling with family is not the same as romantic honeymoon for 2.  Save your money and perhaps  next year you can go to Paris. \n\nWhile on this vacation,  make sure you spend a lot of time just the 2 of you.  Don't let them pressure you into doing too many group activities.   Have a positive attitude and have a great time. \n\nCongratulations and good luck.", "I never thought I'd say this about someone who paid for an all-expenses trip to Hawaii, but your FIL is a massive asshole. You are NTA at all.\n\nYou were very clear that you were not interested in a trip with the family, and for very good reason. He stomped all over that. \n\nAs far as what to do? I have no clue, but you're not wrong no matter what you decide as long as you and your husband are on the same page.\n\nI would be tempted to go to Hawaii, but book a room at an undisclosed other hotel for at least half the trip so you and your husband can be alone and do your own thing (because hey, free flights to Hawaii!).  But that's me - like I said, no matter what you decide you are completely not an asshole here.", "NTA\n\nWhy don't you look into getting your own place to stay in Hawaii for part or all of the vacation? \n\nThat way, you and your husband have the option to do your own thing as newlyweds where family members won't need noice canceling headphones and then you can choose when to spend time with the family plus avoid being made into impromptu babysitters during the holiday for the nibblings.", "Can you create private time while there? Like go for 3 days to another place by yourselves? Compromise? Then do a totally private honeymoon next year?", "NTA, but I would recommend going to Hawaii this year with the caveat that your REAL honeymoon will be later.  \n\nYour in-laws probably view this (especially if they are paying for it) as them helping you take your honeymoon.  It's clueless, but kind.  \"Now you don't have to worry about paying for it!\"  \n\nMy husband and I are going to Hawaii for our honeymoon this year...  And our 19th anniversary.  We were beyond broke when we got married so our initial honeymoon was a weekend at a kitschy hotel.  But we both agreed it wasn't a real honeymoon.    \n\n\nSmile, take the free vacation, and save money and time for an even better vacation.  Your husband will be happy, your in-laws will be happy, and you'll even get a tropical vacation out of it while planning an even better honeymoon.", ">my husband\u2018s father asked about honeymoon plans, we told him we were trying to plan something after the wedding, in late April or early May.

Not the point of the post, but it needed to be said. The US needs to catch up with Europe on this.\n\nYour FIL knew when you were planning your PTO for, knew you couldn't do both and knew that you were intending on having your honeymoon then. He completely ignored what you said and has now pitted you against everyone else, so if you say no and stick to your plan, you look like the bad guy.\n\nNTA\n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting to go on your honeymoon, and the fact that your FIL booked a trip and paid in advance is a power move. If you go, he knows he's manipulated you into skipping your honeymoon. If you don't go, you'll be the person that prevented your husband from going on a family holiday to Hawaii. Unless you had already booked your honeymoon, he's got you over a barrel here. And he knows it.\n\nThat, or he forgot and genuinely thinks he's doing something good, without considering the ramifications of doing this. Not everyone has malicious intentions, which I forget on here sometimes. Could be he sees it as helping with you both getting a good honeymoon?\n\nEither way, you're not an asshole, and he may or not be an asshole, depending on his intent. I hope you and your husband have a great time, whether you go on this trip or elsewhere.", "NTA however, I would try to take a step back and reframe your honeymoon in your mind. As you have not taken the trip immediately after your wedding\u2026your honeymoon can be exactly when you decide it is. You can happily go on the free family trip to Hawaii and have an additional year to save money for your honeymoon the following year\u2026.continue to refer to it as your honeymoon. We couldn\u2019t afford the trip that we wanted immediately after our wedding so we waited 4 years to go on our honeymoon and ended up having a 5 week trip to South Africa which was amazing and most definitely was our honeymoon.", "While it appears the general consensus is not to go, there are reasons to go.\n\nIt\u2019s a one in a lifetime opportunity.\n\nBecause your FIL is an ass, doesn\u2019t mean the whole family is.\n\nLife can change in a moment.  An absolute moment.  You could end up regretting it, and dealing with repercussions for many years.\n\nThat being said, make sure this is the last time for manipulation.  Shake off the pissedoffedness and tell the husband you want the best honeymoon in existence for next year.", "You are NTA. FIL maybe a little. The real problem here is both trips sound amazing and you should be able to take them. 10 days PTO is absolute BS and is  not something we should have to deal with. You are actually contemplating giving up an experience of a lifetime because of your job! We are so accustomed to feeling like our jobs own us that we forget we are on earth to LIVE. Go Live! You will regret missing either", "NTA - youre an adult and can use your pto and travel how you want. If you want to use that for a honeymoon this year, thats fine. Your FIL is a jerk for planning this trip against your wishes. \n\nWith that said - it is a free trip to hawaii\u2026.

You may very well you husband feels the same way you do.", "NTA, but your FIL seems controlling - booking a holiday for people after they already said no? Doesn't matter that he's paying, it ain't a gift when you don't want it", "Personal opinion is that FIL planned this family trip as kind of a honeymoon for you and DH, he just included the whole family as not to leave any other of his kids out. I honestly don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing it maliciously or anything. It might not be the honeymoon that you had in mind, but couldn\u2019t you make it work? Of that week, couldn\u2019t you and DH plan to have day 2-3 days of complete alone time to do what you to want together? Then spend the rest of the trip with the family? You\u2019re NTA by any means, and I completely understand your feelings! But it seems FIL is trying to gift you a trip as a honeymoon because he knows you and DH haven\u2019t had one and are trying to save for one. Unless there\u2019s some bad blood between you and the in-laws that isn\u2019t included here. Just some food for thought!", "YTA.  Take the free trip lady.

And make sure your husband tells your FIL that at the end of the Hawaii trip.\n\nThen, when your FIL pulls this again next year, you won't feel guilty about depriving hubby of another family trip, since he already got one this year.\n\nAnd, if your FIL really is a controlling asshole, when you turn down his trip next year, he'll stop inviting you on trips altogether. Which means you won't have this particular problem going forward.", "Im going to say NAH- I see what you want and value is the honeymoon but it seems your husband also values this trip highly. Your FIL is slightly a A-hole for doing this but I\u2019m going to benefit of doubt him as someone who seems to make/have enough money that he doesn\u2019t understand your limited PTO. I would tell you as a married person there are compromises we all have to make and sometimes don\u2019t want to to make our partners happy. If you could discuss this with him and let him know how you feel about it to move past your resentment ghat would help you enjoy a free trip better maybe try that. Then plan the best honeymoon you can. Best wishes on the trips and your future married life.", "NTA but make this trip revolve around you and your husband! Hawaii is gorgeous and romantic. You certainly don\u2019t have to be hanging out with his family the whole time. Make your husband pick two dinners with them and spend the rest by yourselves. Pick one or two days to hang with them and spend the rest by yourselves! Definitely get your own rental car, not sure how people travel to Hawaii without one. There are so many beaches, hikes, restaurants, bars, etc to see. Plan some exciting excursions and practice saying \u201cno\u201d when they try to get you to do everything they want to do. Then start planning your \u201choneymoon\u201d for next year!", "NTA \n\nPull out and have a talk w your husband about boundaries with his family and priorities.", "NAH. You just won the fricking vacation lottery!! Go on the Hawaii trip, it's a great opportunity for an awesome, paid-for vacation.  You can do your special honeymoon trip next year.   Looking back, the TIMING of your honeymoon really doesn't matter - the trip is special because it's the two of you, together, celebrating each other. Seriously, if someone offers you a significant FREE vacation - grab it with both hands! This is a great opportunity for the BOTH of you, you just have to let go of your tunnel vision about this year being the honeymoon trip, and relax about it. It doesn't have to be one or the other, YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL!!! Just adjust your mindset and grab that golden opportunity.", "Redditors hate controlling in laws, and your fil is being controlling so I see why the consensus is n t a. But I also feel crazy reading these comments. If you set aside your resentment, you are looking at a free luxury trip with the man you love and the family that he loves and then another trip the next year just the two of you. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to of course and if it feels super important symbolically not to go then don\u2019t go. But it feels a little absurd to not just enjoy a life that is offering you multiple opportunities to travel. \n\nInitially I thought maybe you don\u2019t want to visit Hawaii because they\u2019re literally begging people not to come there but that\u2019s not the issue. Lol", "NTA. Your FIL probably thinks he's doing you a favour. Also - they are your family too now...   \nI get that a holiday with Hubs is not the same as a honeymoon.... but it will still be special later on. <3 Trust me, it took us a few years to finally take our honeymoon and it was still amazing :)", "Can you and you\u2019re DH take 2-3 days while in Hawaii to go somewhere by yourself? A different city maybe. Get away from everyone and concentrate on the 2 of you? \n\nI know it\u2019s not ideal but then everybody gets what they want.

You explicitly told FIL you want your honeymoon NOT a family trip, and he did it anyway RIGHT when you would be taking your honehmoon.\n\nYou should stick to your boundaries. Because I imagine there\u2019ll be more of hubby\u2019s family crossing them and your husband didn\u2019t do much to stop it either", "NTA. You say your husband is supportive but he's guilting you into giving up your honeymoon. Why doesn't he want his honeymoon. He isn't really being supportive if he's going along with this.", "NTA\n\nThis is a power play by your FIL. He gets to coerce his son one more time and impress his girlfriend.\n\nBut you're right, it would be churlish refuse an all expenses paid vacation to Hawaii. You can reschedule your honeymoon to next year. \n\nI'm really hoping that he's reserved  the honeymoon suite for you both as a nice surprise and that they'll leave you two alone most of the time. Your husband needs to check in with him that this is your de facto honeymoon and he's not expecting you two to bunk in with others or babysit kids.", "NTA. If a gift is forced upon you, and inconveniences plans you already made and were excited about, then it\u2019s okay to be disappointed by the gift. You don\u2019t have to be excited just because someone spent a lot of money on something you didn\u2019t ask for.", "NTA. It is incredibly sad that your husband isn't immediately in your corner on this... his parents deliberately hijacked your honeymoon timeframe!  Have you asked him why a family trip (set up to deliberatly conflict with stated plans) is more important than your planned honeymoon & gotten a reasoned response?  This is a questions that really needs an answer.", "OP, of course you're NTA. \n\nMan... I don't envy this decision. I completely understand how difficult this must be. I'd be absolutely torn myself. I sprung a honeymoon trip onto my husband...\n\nAbout a week or so after my husband and I got married (Jan. 10, 2009), I planned a surprise honeymoon to the US Caribbean Island of St. Croix. He had NO IDEA that it had been planned. At least not until about 2 weeks before we left (May 12, 2009 is when we left for our 5 day, 4 night honeymoon). We worked together and I was in charge of payroll. So, I slotted the time with our boss and told him that he needed to keep quiet about it. \n\nTwo weeks before we left, we got into a small argument about me changing my name on my license \\[I had already booked our trip, long before in my maiden name\\], because I said that I couldn't change my license yet. \n\nHe thought it was something nefarious and it was the opposite of that. He wouldn't let it go, so I ended up throwing the itinerary at him. It took him a few minutes to \"get it.\" Then asked, \"Where the hell is St. Croix\"? When I told him, he cried and then asked, \"Well, what about the pets, a babysitter...\" I told him EVERYTHING was handled and done... even all of the packing. Then, he apologized for ruining the surprise and said, \"No one has ever done anything like this for me.\" \n\nI couldn't imagine if someone offered us a free trip to Hawaii for the same time-frame!!! That would be a REALLY difficult decision.", "NTA, but hear me out, it's a free trip to Hawaii. \n\nI don't understand your anger because 1) it's already been a month since your wedding and you were planning for more months out, so what does a few more months delay really mean? and 2) you didn't have anything actually planned or bought.\n\nI could completely understand if you had plane tickets to Italy or at least a solid plan of where and when you were going that your family knew about and they made this trip at the same time. That's a real dick move. But you have nothing. Delay your honeymoon and take the free trip.", "NTA. You're in a no-win game. Anyway, you could save the money and do unpaid time off to cover yourself for the honeymoon. Let it go. Don't let it ruin the future. Make clear it won't happen again.", "NTA.  I would go on the trip, but here me out:\n1. It\u2019s fully paid.  Save up your money to on an even nicer trip for next year.\n2. Book a couple day trips for just the two of you.\n3. The above would be a great compromise for everyone.", "I read that list of people invited and that sounds like a nightmare. Good luck. NTA.", "Nta, do your honeymoon. If you can\u2019t back out of the trip - do your own thing like it would be just the two of you", "NTA. And it's not to late to back out!", "Info - can you take unpaid leave from work? So you can have both trips? At least this way you\u2019d get a free Hawaii trip AND a honeymoon in the same year.", "You\u2019re NTA at all. However imo you should go to Hawaii with your partner. It\u2019s one in a lifetime opportunity (unless you\u2019re rich which isn\u2019t very unlikely) so just take it and make the most out of it. You have a new house so you can\u2019t absolutely rock it there when it comes to the other stuff. I would personally go, and also take a weekend with husband as a short honeymoon and go to an even bigger one the next year. Your father in law is the AH but I guess make the most out of the situation that\u2019s my advice", "NTA, but I agree that I would probably go and let your husband have this trip with his family.  Doesn't sound like they do this alot.  Do you have to go the entire time the family is there?  I couldn't tell how long the Hawaii trip was, but could you compromise and just go for a few days, and still be able to take off for your honeymoon?  If you had your honeymoon trip booked already, then that might be different.  I would be more inclined to just use the excuse, sorry, I don't have enough days off for the Hawaii trip and we already had our honeymoon booked, but it doesn't sound like anything had been set yet.\n\nIf you do the Hawaii trip, I know it's not the honeymoon, but maybe some of the days you and your husband could just plan an excursion just for the 2 of you to go off by yourself?  It could be a mini honeymoon until the real one takes place.\n\nI agree it's not right how the FIL did it, but not many people get a free trip with their whole family all together like that, so I would probably try to compromise this time.", "NTA. Send your husband without you and save your PTO. (Since it seems like you get less PTO than your husband.) Or take the time unpaid if you can afford it.", "Nta start saving for honeymoon  TELL NO ONE on hubs's family until you're heading to the airport", "NTA. It\u2019s an incredibly generous offer, but I get wanting to take a honeymoon with just your husband. This makes me think of season 1 of The White Lotus when Shane\u2019s mom joins them on their honeymoon in Hawaii.", "You\u2019re friends are right with their advice.  Not the asshole for being upset but you would be in you acted on it.  It\u2019s not a hill worth dying on to drive a wedge in your relationship with your in laws so early in the marriage.  Smile and go.", "NTA as its your honeymoon and you and your husband should get to do what you want to especially as you have such a small amount of time off.\n\nHowever i can sort of see the FILs point of view too.  If they want to have a big family holiday should they wait another year just because of two people?  Especially if those people haven't booked the honeymoon yet?  \n\nIts a difficult one as i think both of you are NTA but for different reasons.", "NTA\n\nNot for being upset, but yeah I think you would for not going on the trip and having a wonderful time. I get you wanted to plan your honeymoon with your husband, and it's disappointing to have to postpone that. \n\nWhy not take several days of the trip to go to a nearby island, just the two of you. It could serve as a kind of mini-honeymoon and would be a lot cheaper than paying for one in Hawaii.", "I actually love this idea lol", "That\u2019s exactly what this feels like. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "And if OP and husband do go. HONEYMOON SEX. Loud and raucous. Make it weird.", "That was my initial reaction, but my husband looked so sad when he saw how pissed I was and that we couldn\u2019t go to Hawaii when his whole family was going. I totally understand that he doesn\u2019t want to be the only one left out, and I would feel terrible for being the person that held him back from this trip. I\u2019m not mad at my husband, I\u2019m pissed at my father-in-law for planning a trip we can\u2019t say no to without feeling like jerks.", "Exactly.  This isn\u2019t a bite the bullet situation.  Your FIL may have meant well, but he obviously was aware of your plans and his actions are very self serving.  This isn\u2019t the best of both worlds because honeymoons are not family affairs.  \n\nI never went on a honeymoon because we had just bought a house and I was out of PTO.  We talked about waiting a year, but life gets in the way and 15 years in we still haven\u2019t managed to make it happen.\n\nThink of it this way, whatever trip you take in April is going to be your honeymoon.  Assume that you won\u2019t have another opportunity.  Are you ok with spending your honeymoon this way?", "This comment is so insightful. The next trip won't feel like a honeymoon and you deserve that feeling!", "I know, this was my first reaction to. Put my foot down and firmly say no on the grounds that we\u2019ve already said no and they chose to plan it anyway. I\u2019m not going for my father-in-law, I\u2019m going for my husband so that he can spend his time in an amazing place with his family. If my husband was even slightly on the fence about wanting to go, there\u2019s absolutely no way in hell we\u2019d be going.", "But will they be able to take any alone time? I'd wonder what the itinerary will be and who is making that. Is every day gonna be filled with family activities, family meals, etc that the honeymooning couple are expected to participate in.", "We did, and we told them this isn\u2019t the year we can go to Hawaii with them. My father-in-law didn\u2019t want to hear that and went a head and booked it anyway. I get that he can travel whenever he wants, I just feel pissed that he chose to plan this trip the same time we were planning our honeymoon, and now expects us to push our honeymoon off to go to Hawaii with him and the family.", "I agree with you that this is totally the attitude to have. I\u2019m just struggling with my disappointment over the honeymoon, but I know we\u2019ll take another one. I think Hawaii will be amazing, and I don\u2019t want to paint my father-in-law has some jerk, he\u2019s actually a really nice guy. I just think he can be thoughtless about how he\u2019s affecting other people sometimes, and when he gets an idea and decides he wants to do something, he doesn\u2019t take other people into account very well.", "I think this is what we\u2019re planning to do, I just feel disappointed \ud83d\ude23", "I think he does feel the same way, but he also loves his family (and I do too, most of the time lol) and I know he\u2019ll be so sad and hurt to miss this trip with them. I feel we\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place.", "To be fair, he booked flights and accommodations for everyone except for us after we told him no, and then started pressuring us into going once he\u2019d already booked EVERYONE else flights and hotels. He used the fact that he had booked for everyone else and there were time constraints on us making a decision to go as a way to pressure us into saying yes, after we\u2019d told him no repeatedly. My husband was sad That everyone else was going and we were not, so I caved and said yes to the trip since I didn\u2019t have flights or hotels booked yet for our honeymoon, so I didn\u2019t have much of an argument to make with my father-in-law once he got the family on board and started putting the screws to us.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to book it as a honeymoon, but I think you\u2019re right that he\u2019s not trying to be malicious. He\u2019s just doing what he wants to do, which is kind of his MO. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s trying to prevent us from going on a honeymoon, he\u2019s just being entirely inconsiderate that, like, we don\u2019t want to go on our honeymoon\u2026 with his family, and now we feel like we\u2019ve been pigeonholed into doing it.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to book it as a honeymoon, but I think you\u2019re right that he\u2019s not trying to be malicious.

I\u2019d beg the front desk staff to put you on the opposite end (maybe you guys should upgrade the room even)!", "He\u2019s never said it was more important, and he agrees with me that his dad is being kind of a jerk and inconsiderate for trying to plan this at the same time he knew we were trying to take our honeymoon. But he also wants to spend this time with his family in Hawaii, and I completely understand that. \ufffc", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. But behind closed doors I\u2019m still pissed. I worry about how else my father-in-law might try to hijack our life and plans in the future by agreeing to go on this trip and reschedule our honeymoon.", "Yeah I\u2019m currently wondering if we should just extend the Hawaii trip and try to stay an extra week without the family. It\u2019s just disappointing that we don\u2019t get the whole honeymoon experience of flying out together and drinking champagne on a plane, having rose petals in our room, all the traditional honeymoon stuff. I\u2019m gonna try to make the best of the trip, and it\u2019s not that I\u2019m not grateful for the trip, I just didn\u2019t imagine going on my honeymoon with my husbands family along for the ride.", "Yep and guilt him into paying for the honeymoon suite for you.", "Worse, it's going to set the tone for the rest of your relationship with him if you show you can be bought or manipulated.

First he planned an all expenses paid trip to the Caribbean and gave it to us as a Christmas gift.  Which is really nice, but then we felt obligated to go when HE wanted.  And these trips are never truly free (PTO, etc).  The next year it was another trip gift, but not as nice, and again we had no say.  Then the following year it was the same.  It used up most of our leave and we were NEVER consulted in advance.  The fourth time we told him we couldn\u2019t make it and OMG the guilt and pressure.  Then the next year we weren\u2019t invited because we \u201churt their feelings and didn\u2019t appreciate them.\u201d  I know people who don\u2019t have this opportunity will say to quit complaining, but it was like being bullied with $$.  Anyway, NTA.", "You should tell your husband you want to go on your honeymoon as planned. It isn't normal for inlaws to plan a trip to compete wtih  your honeymoon or to pay for it without your agreement to go. Going sets the precedent that your inlaws can dictate your vacations. AND your hsuband agrees with that.", "So your husband also values a trip with the whole family over the honeymoon???", "Enjoy Hawaii, just remember to not share info with hid family", "Yeah.  Presenting you with a fait accompli - I've already planned and paid, so now you have to go - makes him TA.\n\nEven in the most sympathetic scenario - one of your in-laws were terminal and they can't wait another year for a vacation - he needed to use his words.", "Is there any way you can ask your FIL is your tickets and hotel can be changed for another date? Explain (again) that you appreciate his generosity, but can\u2019t get the time off. \n\nPart of me wants to simply confront him to ask him why he was still hellbent on making vacation plans despite the fact you told him about your and your husband\u2019s honeymoon plans. He could get cranky, call you ungrateful, sure, but he undermined your autonomy and plans as his son\u2019s spouse. It\u2019s best to get this out in the air now before it festers and becomes the start of a lifetime of situations you resent him for.", "You have a husband problem. He\u2019s prioritizing his family\u2019s wants over yours. Trust me, I know from experience that it will not stop happening unless you put your foot down. I recommend telling your husband to go on your \u201cHoneymoon\u201d with his family in Hawaii and you will go alone on the honeymoon you had planned and were excited about without him. Get used to going on vacations alone or with his family ever year because this is just the start of it.", "They can just pick and choose what to attend. FIL can't physically force them to adhere to an itinerary once they're there.", "NTA if your FIL is making reservations for you against your wishes, that\u2019s on him. You and your husband need to present a united front in all things or get steamrolled. \n\nIf the \u201choneymoon\u201d is a substantial length of time after the wedding it tends to lose priority in other people\u2019s eyes, just saying.", "NTA. Your FIL went against your express wishes. Nip the in-law dominance in the bud now, it'll likely only get worse otherwise.", "Wait a minute.. you stated in a comment above he DID NOT book it without your permission so what\u2019s the truth here? He booked everyone else BUT you and hubby then you felt pressured and bad because it made your husband sad.. so which is it? I\u2019m confused here", "If you get a chance, tell us what improvements you can make to your real honeymoon when it comes.", "Well, if youre going to be disappointed what better place to do it than all expenses paid all-inclusive resort.", "Hi OP!  Just a suggestion\u2026 while it may not be where you wanted to go on your honeymoon or the timeframe.. is there a compromise you can make with the family before you go, such as.. we will go BUT if all of you would be so kind to give a some privacy for a few days to explore on our own?\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s asking too much.. I\u2019d be jumping up and down for the chance to see Hawaii!!! For FREE. \n\nSo it\u2019s up to you and hubby but I understand your feelings do I wanted to throw a compromise out there. \nNTA  communication is good though.", "Look I love my family to pieces. We see each other every week and we go on one big family trip every year, which I love.  But even with that the first step is making sure everyone is free on the dates that we want to go.  If we ran it past one person who said \u201cnope not free that week\u201d the planning would stop there.  His family didn\u2019t do that for him for what reason?  \n\nNow your limited PTO is another factor that may mean you can\u2019t do both his family trip and your honeymoon, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be out of line to still plan their family trip knowing you can\u2019t attend, but at least your husband could if it wasn\u2019t in the exact same time frame as your honeymoon.  They didn\u2019t give him any consideration here and that should say a lot to him.", "So FIL initially didn\u2019t include you and your husband, told you that you needed to make a decision soon, your SO kind of wanted to go anyway, and then after a while you said OK\u2026 then that\u2019s when the accommodations were booked for you and your husband?", "Those were my initial thoughts just by what\u2019s posted, with no background on how FIL typically is. Talk to DH again. If you and him can make your honeymoon trip work this year and decline the family trip, that can give him something to look forward to. You\u2019re definitely NTA and neither is DH. FIL takes that role by booking a trip without checking with all of you first, siblings and their families included. What if one of them can\u2019t go because of work or other commitments??", "You\u2019ll need to approach that on a situation by situation basis, and when you find the hill to die on, die.  Hawaii isn\u2019t that hill tho. Hawaii is a beach with mountains\n\nOthers have suggested making plans there with just your husband for several of the days:  do that", "You don\u2019t know that. Did it occur to you he might have thought he was being KIND and trying not to make you feel BAD you could not go on a honeymoon without funds to go right away.. and to avoid conflict and other family members whining \u2026\u201d you did help us with OUR vacation or honeymoon in the past\u201d!!! That maybe to make it fair he did it the way he did?! I really think you\u2019re jumping to conclusions about his intentions and reading into something that isn\u2019t there. If your attitude is going to continue every time they do something nice for you I suggest counseling for you because something deeper seem going on here.", "I get that. Imagination can be a lot of trouble. Real life is both (often simultaneously) much less, and much better than we can imagine. This could be the start of a beautiful adventure with your inlaws.

If you and he share a vision for what feels like a good balance of family time and romantic time alone, then take it to his dad and be clear that you are excited about having a trip that balances family time and couple time and be VERY clear that he knows that you don\u2019t mean one night out of ten we will not be joining the family, or whatever mental spin he may put on it. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to be staying at a nice hotel/ resort, you can reach out to the concierge ahead of time and get them in your corner by explaining that your FIL surprised you with this opportunity and that you and your fianc\u00e9 want to make sure your charges for romantic couple experiences aren\u2019t charged to your very generous FIL, etc, and then book the things you\u2019d like to do with your husband (and no one else) before you go. And make arrangements with the hotel staff now to pay for those things yourselves. It will be much easier to stay on plan if you do all of this, and your FIL sounds strong-willed enough that I think you might need to. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re coordinating with the hotel staff ahead of time, you can ask if they can upgrade your \u201cvery generous FIL\u201d and his girlfriend if there\u2019s availability, because they\u2019re being \u201cso thoughtful to do this for everyone,\u201d which will make it harder for you to be painted as ungrateful should anyone in the family take umbrage at your not joining them for everything. Maybe send a surprise bottle of wine to their room. (You and your then-husband could very well end up upgraded because of this, too.)\n\nGood luck! I think if you talk this out ahead of time it could end up being a good vacation.", "Maybe you've said this elsewhere, but has your husband actually confronted his dad about why he did this knowing you were planning your honeymoon then?", "Get your husband to see your pov.
