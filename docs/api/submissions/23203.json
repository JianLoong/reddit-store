So I (19f) was about to have my son, my mil always insisted I let her be in the delivery room with me but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with that since I\u2019d be spread open wide and push a baby out of my hooha. So I politely said \u201cI\u2019d like it to be my mom and my bf, because I\u2019m a very private person.\u201d She insisted more and said she\u2019s seen plenty of births and wouldn\u2019t judge me. But I just wasn\u2019t comfortable and my bf said it was 100% my decision. \nSo birth day, it was around 10am when I went to the hospital, we made some calls to my family and he called his family, my mother came to the room and instantly grabbed my hand and asked if I needed anything, I was around 6cm and in a lot of pain. Next thing I knew I heard the door and there was my mil. She asked how I was doing and I said \u201cin pain but what are you doing in here\u201d and she made a sad face and said \u201cwell, you have your mom for support so I\u2019m here to support my son, and I\u2019m so excited for my new grand baby.\u201d \nThe nurse looked at me and asked if I wanted her in there and I said \u201cno.\u201d So she kicked her out. I gave birth to my son a few hours later and requested no visitors, there were only supposed to be 2 in a room with me anyways. After they moved me to a different room, my mil and her side of the family all came into my room at once and all decided to pass my son around. I was furious! I grabbed my bf and told him to kick everyone out including his mom, and I told the nurse no one except my mom and bf into the room because I\u2019ve had enough. \nA week after my son was born I finally let my bf\u2019s side of the family see my son with strict rules (wash hands, NO KISSING, and no smoky clothes) well my mil decided she was gonna kiss my son all over his face and told me it was no big deal. So I packed up and left with my son, and now I\u2019m ignoring her. My bf thinks she crossed too many boundaries and said she\u2019s always been like this, so he said I\u2019m definitely in the right, but ofc his family thinks I\u2019m in the wrong bc it\u2019s her grand baby. It\u2019s my son, and she hasn\u2019t respected any of my wishes.

What a piece of work.\n\nGood for you for having her kicked out! She showed exactly zero respect for you and your bf's wishes. Your bf is right...she has no sense of boundaries and those that are laid down are nothing but challenges for her to breach.\n\nHe's not her grandbaby more than he's your son. You and bf trump all. I'm glad he's backing you up in this, sounds like you're going to need him to lay a brick wall down so she can understand she isn't running the show.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nWhat an absolutely horrid MIL.  She invites herself to your birth which is balsy to start with.  Then after being told no she pushes herself into the room anyway?  Could she be more self-centered.  \n\n> mil decided she was gonna kiss my son all over his face and told me it was no big deal\n\nIt absolutely was a big deal because MOM SAID SO you dense asshole of a woman.  Zero respect for you.", "My heart broke for you reading this. This woman is horrible and you cannot have her anywhere near you again. Your BF needs to deal with this. It\u2019s his mother. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nPeople were very clear with her and she just seemed to ignore them.  In the middle of labor is not the time for this kind of BS, she needs a serious check on her behavior.", "NTA! She\u2019s just awful! Grandma entitlement! So nice to know bf is in 100% agreement. His family needs to know that these boundaries are ones you have made as a team, not made by you individually. \n\nCongrats on your new baby!", "NTA, my wife had depression after the birth of our kid, so I became the primary caretaker. Anyone that didn't respect our boundaries regarding the baby had no baby time, no hugs no sniffs no nothing, including grandpas and grandmas from both side. Everyone complained and started calling me  \"\"the big rooster\", i'm not from the us, they were trying to imply that I was overprotective, it is something related to chickens being great badass moms that will fight for the baby chicks. I have no regrets and everyone learned to follow the rules near my baby.", "NTA. MIL sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA. To family that commebts on it:\n\n\"She has nobody but herself to blame. She doesn't get to ignore my wishes when it comes to my son. If she ever learns that lesson, she's free to let her son know.\"", "NTA good for you!", "NTA - To her it's just a giant power play. It's what SHE wants versus the incubator that gave her son a baby. She feels entitled and like she has rights to do whatever she wants, even under the flimsiest of reasons.\n\nFrankly, I wouldn't let her near you or the baby without it being a neutral location with BOTH of you there and you wearing the baby so she cant snag him. This is the one power play she should not win - it is not her baby, and if she cant follow your rules she needs to lose access until she learns.", "NTA- That baby has zero immunity and the MIl mouth is full of germs. If you don\u2019t set boundaries now, she will never learn.", "NTA she wont  respect what you want so she shouldn\u2019t be around you or your baby. Kissing a newborn is a big No", "NTA and snaps to your bf for sticking by your decisions.", "Good on your young boyfriend to stand up to his own mother!  Lots of stories around here about people who are older and should be wiser and more mature not standing up to their pushy family.", "NTA my baby isn\u2019t even one yet and we had the same rules for our little one too. Frankly it should be common sense but too many people just ignore them even when told directly not to do it. You guys have done so good about sticking up for yourselves and baby! I wish I was this strong and capable at your age, I\u2019m in my thirties and still struggle.", "NTA, and good for you and BF for have such strong boundaries and values at your age! I was in my 30s before I had the backbone to say enough to my MIL.", "Who gives a shit what his family think especially when they\u2019re wrong? Send them all articles on the dangers of kissing newborns.", "NTA", "NTA at all. It's your baby so it's 100% you and your bf decision about who gets to see the baby. And your the one giving birth, so you get to choose who is in the room with you as you deliver. MIL has no right to decide that she can be in the delivery room.", "NTA, you are doing everything right.

She shouldn't have to tell him to stand up to his mommy.\n\nShe shouldn't have had to make the nurses throw his parents out of the delivery room. He needed to put his foot down a LONG time ago."]}
