So I (19f) was about to have my son, my mil always insisted I let her be in the delivery room with me but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with that since I\u2019d be spread open wide and push a baby out of my hooha. So I politely said \u201cI\u2019d like it to be my mom and my bf, because I\u2019m a very private person.\u201d She insisted more and said she\u2019s seen plenty of births and wouldn\u2019t judge me. But I just wasn\u2019t comfortable and my bf said it was 100% my decision. \nSo birth day, it was around 10am when I went to the hospital, we made some calls to my family and he called his family, my mother came to the room and instantly grabbed my hand and asked if I needed anything, I was around 6cm and in a lot of pain. Next thing I knew I heard the door and there was my mil. She asked how I was doing and I said \u201cin pain but what are you doing in here\u201d and she made a sad face and said \u201cwell, you have your mom for support so I\u2019m here to support my son, and I\u2019m so excited for my new grand baby.\u201d \nThe nurse looked at me and asked if I wanted her in there and I said \u201cno.\u201d So she kicked her out. I gave birth to my son a few hours later and requested no visitors, there were only supposed to be 2 in a room with me anyways. After they moved me to a different room, my mil and her side of the family all came into my room at once and all decided to pass my son around. I was furious! I grabbed my bf and told him to kick everyone out including his mom, and I told the nurse no one except my mom and bf into the room because I\u2019ve had enough. \nA week after my son was born I finally let my bf\u2019s side of the family see my son with strict rules (wash hands, NO KISSING, and no smoky clothes) well my mil decided she was gonna kiss my son all over his face and told me it was no big deal. So I packed up and left with my son, and now I\u2019m ignoring her. My bf thinks she crossed too many boundaries and said she\u2019s always been like this, so he said I\u2019m definitely in the right, but ofc his family thinks I\u2019m in the wrong bc it\u2019s her grand baby. It\u2019s my son, and she hasn\u2019t respected any of my wishes.

Even a minor respiratory virus can cause enough inflammation to make it difficult for them to breath, and if they have a fever then they\u2019re gonna need an extensive workup and treatment because a fever in this age group could be meningitis or a cold and the only way I can tell which is to stick a needle in their spine.", "NTA but what the heck is going on with hospitals in all of the posts about MIL crashing the delivery.

So having those boundaries is best for the baby. You were only looking out for your baby. I\u2019m glad your boyfriend is also recognizing your MIL\u2019s error.

So you both could use some growing up and acting right in your lives.", "NTA, not by a long shot\n\nAlso, as your reddit attorney (disclaimer: I'm not an actual attorney) I would strongly advise you against EVER letting her babysit, even when your kid is older.  She won't respect a single rule or boundary y'all set, and the moment you try to put your foot down, she'll get the family involved.\n\nMy own mother is like this with my nieces and nephews.  In the past she has given them haircuts without asking their mom, taken them to religious and political events without mom's consent, road trips, shopping trips, etc. without checking with mom (or not tell at all, one of the kids tells momma).

Hard pass.", "Ok fine to start with maybe a bit of a dick move to not invite her but after that she turned up anyway barged into op room passed the baby around without permission op literally had 3 reasonable requests and of course MIL broke one of them and how can you think op is the A fort not wanting someone like that arou d her baby. Even her own son is against her don't you think that's a bit wierd", "NTA.\nEveryone will have the same answers as me, but NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m a firm believer in \u201cstart as you mean to go on\u201d.
