Has no personal skills and an extremely low eq. She has scary meltdowns that have placed her on court ordered holds several times and two times while she was in college. She went to this local college for about 10 years to finish her bachelor\u2019s degree in art. It was split up between an associate and a bachelor. She struggled and had breakdowns but my parents kept encouraging her. She graduated while the students loans was on hold and can\u2019t get a job with her art degree and her personal skills. She once had a major meltdown during an interview and my mom had to come get her from the hospital because the police was called. She\u2019s a bigger girl so it can be scary for people if she has one. My mom tried to sue the employer and always is getting a lawyer for my sister for her actions or for discrimination because of her actions. \n\nNow that there\u2019s no forgiveness for student loans and my sister hardly gets enough disability to cover everything my parents find out she\u2019s in around 6 figures student loan debt and they co-signed for. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge debt that can\u2019t be written off and my parents said they only filed paperwork like once or twice for my sister and didn\u2019t even realize what is going on. I told my mom maybe she shouldn\u2019t have encouraged my disabled sister to get her Art degree. My mom is the type that posted the whole time about my sister going to college and living her dream on the spectrum. My sister repeatedly had to retake courses, had specialized requirements and private tutoring. \n\nMy mom is now publicly bashing the university for doing this but I feel like my parents are to blame for basically giving my sister a blank check and acting like it was inspirational. My parents asked me to help out financially with my sister and I said no. They tried asking me what\u2019s going to happen to her when they die because she\u2019s in so much debt and I said you should have thought about that because she\u2019s not living with me and I\u2019m not even going to take care of her. My family thinks I\u2019m awful but I feel like everyone is irresponsible for even pushing my sister to be inspirational and forcing her in a life long debt that she\u2019ll never pay back.", "created_utc": 1688840358, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ubcqj/aita_for_saying_my_sister_should_have_been_to/", "score": 315, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a hill to die on. Your parents encouraged this. Let them figure it out.", "Was what you said harsh? Yes but your parents needed to hear this 10 years ago. There\u2019s no need to make your sister your financial burden and so you\u2019re nta", "You're NTA for not wanting to take on the responsibility of looking after your sister when your parents aren't around and you're certainly NTA for not wanting to contribute financially to their reckless spending. If they're concerned about your sister, they're going to have to figure out a way that she's properly taken care of that doesn't involve you.", "NTA. College is only useful if one can later on apply their degree in order to gain employment. It doesn't seem to be thevcase with your sister, and didn't seem so ten years ago when she started college. That's on your parents, not on you. You don't bear responsibility for her.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't be expected to help with debts that have absolutely nothing to do with you. What you said was harsh but not untrue.", "NTA. You are entirely correct. An art degree is absolutely useless, unless you also have a degree in computer science or something like that, so it can be applied to the movie industry or something that will actually pay you a salary.\n\nYour parents sound completely clueless. They only briefly looked at the paperwork, while co-signing for 6-figure loans? Your sister may be financially illiterate, but she gets some of that from your parents.\n\nIn no way are you responsible for her, or her and your parent's bad financial decisions.", "NTA. Being autistic is not the problem here. The problem is how your parents have handled it her entire life. She never should have taken out loans for college, and your parents claiming ignorance when the co-signed is shady at best. They knew what was going on, and they're pretending they didn't now that it's a huge problem. I get integrating her into society a bit, and allowing her to get a creative art degree, but she should have had a shadow in class to remove her or talk to her before a meltdown occurred. She also should have been pressured after college to create art so that she makes a little pocket change. Why wasn't an AA at a junior college good enough?\n\nIt's not your job to take care of her once your parents are gone. If they care that much, and she's in debt, they can get her set up with a live in care home before they die. They'll feed her, and she'll have access to paratransit and things like that. She's not going to be homeless if they start caring now in a grounded way, but don't feel like you need to play savior if they screw that all up, too.\n\nThere are supports for people like your sister, but it sounds like she's been enabled and hasn't been properly supported. This really sucks for you and for her. I'm sorry.", "NTA, your parents kinda of set her up for failure. My stepbrother is also autistic and I can't imagine him in college. He also has meltdowns that are really bad. He was kicked out of school when he was in the second grade, and he hasn't been back. Every child is not meant for college.", "INFO: did your sister ever express that she did/did not want to go to college ? did she ever ask to quit ?", "I'm guessing the title should've been \"... sister shouldn't have been ...\", right? I'm not sure if this is an AITA post because you seem to carry a lot of animosity towards your sister and I'm guessing that she either made your life miserable when you were growing up or your parents neglected you in favour of her?", "NTA. Yes, what you said was a little out of line, but it\u2019s time that your parents get the reality check they need to hear. They have been dwindling all their finances on your sister and the college she went to. \n\nAs someone who is on the autistic spectrum, and graduated college (and is still actively finding a job), I can understand that some people on the spectrum are born with certain quirks. Sometimes college doesn\u2019t really work out for everyone, and they\u2019re better off just getting something else in fields they pursue, that is, as long as they are mentally capable. It sounds like your sister gets a little mentally checked out every often, and it leads to situations that not only could risk herself, but other people around her. It should\u2019ve been your parents realizing that college just isn\u2019t for her and pulled her out; either until she\u2019s in a better mental state, or just not have to deal with it again and help her. As I\u2019ve said, autism ranges to many different levels, it would all depend on your sister\u2019s own mentality. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to help your sister because she\u2019s not your responsibility, she\u2019s your parents\u2019. I know that debt is hard to get rid of, depending on the different circumstances, and I know that student debt is especially hard for people who have to deal with paying every last penny back, but your parents screwed themselves with potentially every last of their finances for the sake of your sister, and they all are not your problem. There are support systems across the USA, and any other country, that can help disabled people, and your parents should\u2019ve tried that for your sister instead of taking the college route.\n\nHang in there, OP. Don\u2019t let them get to you. I\u2019m sure there is a solution to pay back the debt, even if it doesn\u2019t involve you, and/or if it\u2019s going to take a hard time to do so. NTA", "NTA, though the issue isn't that she didn't deserve to go to college -- even if someone does nothing with the degree, the experience itself could be worth it, though in this case it feels like they encouraged college to feel good about themselves, not for her sake -- so much as your parents signing stuff without reading the terms and yelling at the university.", "No. She always said she like drawing and painting but she has the mental capacity of maybe a 11 year old", "i\u2019m gonna go w NTA. this situation is hard. i\u2019m a really big advocate for trying to integrate people with mental disabilities into society so they can live a life as close to (what\u2019s socially considered) normal. BUT what your parents did \u2026 inexcusable. they ruined her life- though your mothers intentions look pure, she gave your sister a huge check and sent her to college where she repeatedly had meltdowns and was forced into an environment that wasn\u2019t made for her. there are so many resources today for people who struggle with the \u201cnormal\u201d school schedule and there are so many jobs that don\u2019t require regular contact with other people so your sister wouldn\u2019t have meltdowns and have the police called on her. it sounds like your mother just wanted her to be an inspiration and gave her all the tools to be but then provided no real support. like wtf is she gonna do with an art degree ??? you have to be super good with people to work as a graphic design artist/ art commission worker. why not send her to a community college and not spend a shit ton THEN THROW THAT EXPENSE ONTO HER ?? i\u2019m so confused. your mom sounds crazy.", "she\u2019s not your responsibility OP, i\u2019m sorry your mom is trying to push her onto you. i don\u2019t understand why your sister isn\u2019t already in a home so she can have a good routine. after your mom is gone she\u2019s likely going to end up homeless because of her parents stupid decisions.", "I totally agree with you! If she's in the USA, even with a good income, her parents would have qualified for various levels of support. It's also possible to have a plan in place before they die. Her enrichment shouldn't have been a random degree, it should have been structured activities and a viable day program that would have taught her useful skills. Sure, maybe she wouldn't have become a rocket scientist with this kind of support, but she'd know how to cook, dress, bathe, and how to cope before regular meltdowns occur.", "Info: what kind of loans? The federal ones can be discharged for total and complete disability.", "NTA, the issue is your parents signed the loan paperwork.  With interest and fines the two times signing could be well into the six figures.  They cannot claim they did not know about it.  All signers are notified about back payments.", "NTA - in no way are you responsible for this happening and I agree with your statement. Gives the vibe that they did it for attention so they looked good and now it\u2019s backfiring miserably", "NTA. Your sister is not your obligation. Your parents need to establish something to support her. The rest of the family who are so upset can let her move in with them and pay her debt.", "Not necessarily. College is also useful for learning, or if you are unable to work due to disability, it can be great for routine, socialization and just generally something to do.\n\nThat said, most people do not have the money to approach college as a hobby like that.", "Also you wrote your sister has the mental capacity of an 11 year old, and she has loans in her name?!?", "NTA. Your parents are in major denial and blaming everyone else for the consequences of their poor decisions. Suggest they or one of their many lawyers negotiate a low monthly payment to pay until the end of time. Your parents cosigned, it is now their debt, are they forgetting that?\n\nStand firm on living your own life. You didn't make this disaster and can't unmake it.", "It sounds like she has high support needs and she\u2019s been pushed too much hence the frequent meltdowns. I wouldn\u2019t pay for your poor parent\u2019s financial decisions. She needs assisted housing that\u2019s probably where she will go when you parents pass.", "I feel sad for your sister who it seems has been relentlessly pushed to fit in with parents expectations. NTA", "NTA 100%!", "NTA. They aren't helping your sister by coddling her. You are right to ask right back: who *is* going to coddle her after they've passed on? She needs to learn to take care of herself and her responsibilities.", "NTA your parents co-signed all those loans. How did they think she was going to pay it back? In no way is any of this your responsibility!", "To be honest, I don't even know if giving a loan to your sister is legal. I think you are NTA simply because you have your own life to live and even if your sister doesn't realize that actions have consequences, your parents are in possession of enough IQ to do so. Have you all thought about declaring bankruptcy? If they can't finance the debt payments, it's bound to happen sooner or later, batter it be sooner and on your own terms.", "NTA.  Don't blame the university either; it offers a product, consumers are free to purchase it or not.\n\nAs for what will happen when your parents die: tell them to take out enough life insurance to pay off the student loans.\n\nIf your sister has the mental capacity of an 11 year old, have your parents been to court to remain her legal guardians even though she's no longer a minor child?", "If she's in the U.S. and if you doubt she can truly hold down a job and support herself through her life, then applying for Social Security may be the answer, and if she is eligible for Social Security, then her federal loans may be forgiven.", "College can be useful for far more reasons than \"the degree gains employment\", that's an incredibly narrow view. Doesn't make any of this OP's problem, but the anti-education view is not a great one.", "How can she then have debts? If your sister has the mental capacity of a 11 year old your sister cannot legally conclude any contracts, at least as I understand the law in most countries of the world.", "Her parents are competent and cosigned so they are on the hook.", "NTA to the max. Your parents don't get to shocked pikachu about debt when their daughter takes 10 years to graduate.", "NTA, I feel so bad for her, and you're not responsible for any of this. I'm autistic, and it took me four years longer to finish high school than any of my other classmates. The idea of even being *encouraged* to go to college would be horrific for me, and I'm decently high functioning. The idea of your mom making it into an inspirational thing is disgusting and shows that she knows nothing about autism. Inspirational is getting an autistic adult to be happy with their life, not destroying it.", "Yeah, no, NTA\n\nParents basically signed your autistic sister into crippling student loan debt. That shit is abuse, and they frankly should be prosecuted.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, I'm 100% sure your sister qualifies to get all her debt discharged due to having a disability. I know two people who have succeeded at this. In her case, she would probably have to go the route of having a doctor fill out page 4 of the application.\n\nCheck out disabilitydischarge.com.", "NTA with anything regarding the loan. They\u2019re on their own. \n\nBut you\u2019re a bit of one by saying you\u2019re \u201cnot even going to take care of her.\u201d That\u2019s pretty callous. If my sister had these problems I\u2019d do everything I could to help. Like, what\u2019s supposed to happen to her when your parents die? She\u2019s going to be out there alone with no money or credit having meltdowns and getting herself arrested. Maybe try being a decent sibling in general. \n\nBe prepared for this callous attitude to affect your relationship with your family, and you\u2019d better pray you don\u2019t encounter any problems in the future because good luck getting help from anybody.", "Hijacking the first comment to say there's disability forgiveness you can apply for through the FAFSA website. I had to do this because I went to college before becoming fully disabled.\n\nBut OP still NTA.", "I definitely agree that OP shouldn't be responsible for any part of this mess. It can be hard to know when to quit higher education especially if your family puts a lot of value on it, but sometimes you just have to and figure out the aftermath on your own. \n\nI recently decided to drop out after an unsuccessful transition to a university from community college after I finished my Associates. It bruised my ego a bit but the $10k tied to that failure hurts a lot more and I'm thankful I finally snapped out of it before it turned into like 4x as much.", "> and he hasn't been back. Every child is not meant for college.\n\nSorry you're saying your brother never finished second grade or any higher education?!", "If she is not yet legally disabled, maybe she can be assessed now", "Also, if the loans were subject to potential forgiveness then they most likely qualify for an income based repayment plan. I\u2019ve never had a parent co sign a loan so I\u2019m not sure, but if she\u2019s unemployed then the payment would be $0.", "Not until you're old and retired, when a lot of colleges will let you take a class for a nominal fee. Had a few elderly people in some of my English classes in college just cause they could.", "Education doesn't have to be a formal college that saddles one with lots of debt.", "He was probably home schooled/tutored. Traditional schooling takes a one size fits all approach which is damaging to a lot of people. My nephew is home schooled at the moment and the improvement in his grades, his temperament and his overall confidence is striking. Just fyi.", "It doesn't seem that the parents ever took the steps for conservatorship. Also, there is no minimum age requirement for federal student loans (just a high school diploma/GED); I'm not sure about private loans.  Either way, it doesn't matter; the parents are competent and co-signed.", "NAH. So many people aren\u2019t realistic about some or the differences that disabled people have, and that\u2019s okay. College isn\u2019t for everyone, and neither are certain jobs. Your mom is an idiot for signing for debt she didn\u2019t understand however.", "NTA  \nYou will never get out from under if you let them trap you into caring for or paying for your sister. This is not your responsibility in any way.", "I am from France, where college is almost free (a few hundred dollars but without a room or anything). I am also physically disabled (not a wheelchair, more like chronic pain in every articulation). I did a five years degree in communication. Took me six. No debt because I worked and lived at home for a good part of it.\n\nIs it gonna pay relatively well? Yes, probably, with a few years of experience. \n\nBut going to school for any kind of \"physical\" job (I don't know, welder, plumber, electrician, anything) would have been faster, cheeper, and would have given me a better salary, quicker.\n\nCould I have done it? The school, probably, with mandatory accommodations for the physical part. \n\nBut I would never have found employment, and even if I did, I would never have been in a position to do it while being physically, mentally and emotionally confortable.\n\nSo I didn't do it because I knew my limitations and what would have been reasonable/feasible for my future. \n\nObviously your sister is not in a position to assess that for herself. So your parents are jerks for enabling her and saddling her (and themselves) with a mountain of debt that will never be repaid, instead of taking those ten years to figure out a plan for her for after their death.", "NTA, parents had no business pushing her into a traditional college if she has the mental capacity of an 11 year old. Your parents signed the loans so this is their problem.", " NTA. Their child, their dumb decisions (student loans), their responsibility.", "You're NTA. \n\n>Now that there\u2019s no forgiveness for student loans and my sister hardly gets enough disability to cover everything my parents find out she\u2019s in around 6 figures student loan debt and they co-signed for\n\nTough. If your mom can afford lawyers to bail your sister out of trouble or to file nuisance lawsuits, she can afford to pay down the debt.\n\nYou're not an A-H for making it clear you won't be on the hook for your sister's care after your parents are gone. Frankly, it already sounds like she needs to be somewhere that can better cater to her needs.", "What could they do for their sister? They are in no way trained to deal with that or willing and thats fine. Also I think OP would be relieved they aren't there when they need help honestly. They sound like a bunch of dicks. We don't get to choose who we are born too, but we do get to choose who we call family.", "NTA. You aren't responsible for any debts that are associated with your sister and becoming connected to them could ruin your credit down the road. How do your parents expect you to buy a house, pay your bills, replace a car, etc if your credit is trash because of your sister's school debt that they pushed. \n\nI do agree that you should point them at the loan repayment programs that are based on income. This might keep your sister from even having to repay the loans more than a few dollars a month.", "NTA Even of your sister wasn't autistic and had excellent interpersonal skills, getting 6 figures in debt for an art degree is a horrible financial choice. I'm not dismissing art as a career, but you can paint pictures or do art commissions without spending six figures. You can take art classes without pursuing a degree and not spend that much. You can get a degree in graphic design and do other kinds of art as a side hustle. \n\nA neurotypical person might get a job withan art degree, but it's unlikely to pay enough that they can pay off six figures before they're 80.\n\nAlso? It sounds like your mom is making your sister's difficulties worse by trying to sue everyone instead of helping get learn better coping mechanisms.", "Federal loans don't need co-signers. Parent plus loans are a different product. \n\nI believe the sister has private loans, that's the only way co-signers makes sense. If that is true they are screwed."]}
