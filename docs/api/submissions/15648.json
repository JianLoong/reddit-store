Is your mom in therapy?  I'm sure a therapist would let her know how unhealthy it is to just ignore your birthday because of your sister's passing.  By the way, I am so sorry for your loss.  I can't even imagine.  You're right your sister would want you to still celebrate your life.  You're still a completely separate individual and you deserve to be celebrated.

Happy late birthday to you !", "NTA, it wasn't right for your mother to take out her grief on you. The day was also your birthday, so you get to celebrate it.

Out of consideration to them, you could celebrate your birthday somewhere else, in a pub or at a friends place.\n\nAnyway, it often happens that parents get so caught up in grieving for a lost child that they forget their other children who are still alive. Don't let that happen to you OP!", "NTA,  your parents are being unreasonable. yes you are still here and they should be working harder to make your day more special.   ignoring the fact, they lost a child and you lost your sister is not going to help anyone in the long run.

They are people suffering unimaginable loss.  You are suffering unimaginable loss.  Give each other GRACE, and get some counseling for yourself and encourage your parents to do the same.

You are still their child, still there with them and they need to recognize just how precious that is because nobody knows what can happen in the next hour, day, month, year.\n\nI think you twin would want you to celebrate your guys day to the fullest.  Don't ever think you're being selfish for doing something happy on your day.", "NTA. Your parents need help. They clearly are still distraught about it and not coping well with missing a child. The \"celebrating without your sister\" comment sounded borderline delusional, like you gotta wait for her to come home first.", "Nta  what your friends did was lovely  Hold onto them. Grief is crazy. You are not selfish. Mum is struggling. Try to give her some compassion but live your life. Like you said. Youre still here.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s clear your parents are grieving hard, and are in need of therapy. Family therapy, perhaps.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine losing my twin. You feel so connected to them. They\u2019re a part of you and that never goes away, so I can\u2019t begin to delve into what you\u2019re feeling, feelings that your parents are neglecting.", "NTA. That\u2019s a sad situation", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Happy birthday to you and your twin. I agree that I think she would have wanted you to celebrate. I hope by next year your joint birthday can be a day to remember all the good memories of you and your twin along with positive thoughts for your own future \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.  I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "Omg NTA and im sorry. Glad you have friends who are supporting tou", "NTA\n\nWhat a lovely gesture from your friends. Always think, what would your sister want? I'd like to think she'd want you to celebrate your birthday, graduation, passing a hard test, whatever you feel like celebrating. She'd want you to be happy. They never tell you it's ok to laugh and smile while grieving but it is. Tell funny stories and laugh at the memory with friends and family.\n\nI am so sorry you and your family are going through this. Grief sucks the hardest. It's confusing at the best of times. I wish you grace and love and strength for all of you. All the best dear OP. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA we lost my oldest brother a few years back. He and my sister were twins. We still celebrated her birthday that year. It was a difficult day but I was so happy to be able to be there for and celebrate her.", "I am a twin and I would be beside myself if he was gone. So the fact your friends did that to cheer you up would mean more to me than anything. \n\nNTA for obvious reasons but, I hope you know she\u2019s always with you celebrating too. Your parents need therapy too. \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA\nI'm so sorry to hear about your sister. Your parents are not thinking straight. Happy belated birthday!", "Nta", "Happy birthday OP. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I\u2019m glad having your friends over helped cheer you up a bit. NTA at all. Not one bit.", "NTA i want to give you a hug. I'm glad you have good friends.", "I am so sorry this happened to you. You are important, and you matter. You did nothing wrong. \n\nI would also suggest going easy on your parents though. They are 100% in the wrong, and I'm sure in the future they will regret this. \n\nNTA.", "Sweet child you did the right thing, you have to go on I am sure your sister would want that for you,  your birthday still exist even if your sister is now celebrating in heaven,   your mom I hope will if she isn't now,  join a group for grieving parents and speak with a professional,  as a mother I know her heart is aching every day , but you are still there in her heart,  she can't let go and move on till she gets some help , and because of that she doesn't know how to be the mom she needs or used to be.  Keep your head up celebrate every year for both you and your sister, she will be with you always to share it in your heart and mind she will never leave", "NTA- I'm sorry for your loss. While its understandable that they are hurting. They still have you and should still be there for you. Bc you also lost someone important. You literally shared a womb and to think you arent understanding is ridiculous. You said the right thing even if she didnt want to hear it.", "Nta- I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your sister. \n\nOf course you should celebrate your birthday if that\u2019s what you want to do. It\u2019s going to happen every year even without your sister there. \n\nSounds like your parents should also be in therapy.", "NTA.  You matter.  Celebrating your birth is not a bad thing.  Is it probably always going to be a little bittersweet if not downright painful given that you lost your twin?  Probably.  But I don't think she'd be ok with you not celebrating. I doubt that's the legacy she'd want.", "NTA-you still exist.  It's selfish of your parents to not acknowledge that.  While it's understandable that they (and you) are sad and it's hard, they should also consider that you are still a living, breathing, child of theirs.  \n\nIt's your twin, you have every right to be sad.  \n\nI'm grateful for you that your friends came to celebrate you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Your parents are TA, they need therapy.", "Nah your mother is still hurting. It's the first birthday and she hasn't worked through her grief.", "NTA.\n\nFirst Happy belated birthday.   Your birthday doesn't go away because your twin isn't with you anymore. \n\nI am so glad your sister's friends were able to celebrate with you.\n\nOn to your parents.  I understand they are grieving but they need to remember they have a living daughter who is grieving too.  I fear they may act this way or worse on your 18th birthday.  It is not fair of them to demand you not celebrate your birthday.   Do you have any family like aunts/uncles/grandparents who might celebrate with you?\n\nYou deserve to celebrate your birthday even though it will be difficult and remind you your sister is gone. I am sorry for your loss op.  This internet stranger wishes they could give you a hug.", "NTA \n\nYour parents need serious help. I am so sorry. You are absolutely allowed to celebrate your birthday. You don\u2019t give up your birthday! It is ok to mourn and be sad about losing your sister. It is absolutely ok to celebrate your birth! You sound like you have wonderful friends. Your mother yelling at you was COMPLETELY wrong and she needs to apologize and remember she still has a daughter here who needs her and depends on her!", "NTA. I cannot imagine losing a child. However, there has been more than one time where I thought my sister or brother were dead, and the thought of losing a sibling was almost unbearable. The fact that you are a twin must make that 100x worse. I know grief though, I have lost my dad. With that, everyone grieves differently and should be allowed the grace to do what they feel is right. This is what you felt was right, and it was not destructive or harmful. I\u2019m am so deeply sorry for the loss of your twin and sister. I\u2019m am so deeply sorry for your parents for losing a daughter. I\u2019d like to suggest some family counseling. I hate the thought of the three of you falling apart because of the deep loss that all of you are going through. Please continue to take care of yourself the best you can.", "Daughter of a twin who passed and the first year my aunt would not allow us to give her a party because she just wasn't up for it. Now with that being said you should be able to celebrate your birthday and your friends definitely rock...My aunt is much better and we celebrated her 70th a year ago with me and my sister sitting in my moms place...", "NAH. What your mother did is clearly wrong but I won't call her an asshole. She lost her kid and it is the first birthday without your sister. I'm sure time will heal the wounds, just try to be there for each other and avoid saying things that you will regret in the future. \n\nLosing a family member is hard, especially a 17-year-old member. Both of you are allowed to be a little unreasonable for a while.", "Your parents lost one twin. If they keep this up they are going to lose both.  NTA.", "NTA. Feel free to tell your parents that this father says they need to get their shit together before they lose a second daughter through their behavior", "As a parent who has lost a child, I can imagine this day is absolutely heartbreaking for them particularly being the first, but it is even more heartbreaking not to acknowledge the day for you \\*and\\* your sister. Your sister would want you to celebrate and I'm glad you have friends who can support you since your parents clearly can't right now.", "Literally, the second sentence says she's in therapy.", "I am so sorry for your loss. I can't even imagine. You're right your sister would want you to still celebrate your life.", " I am so sorry for your loss.", "That they are putting emotional distance in between you and them because of the memories you stir up. NTA.", " I would want to celebrate the living twin's birthday while also finding a way to honor the twin that passed away.", "Her parents aren\u2019t assholes.  They are grieving.  BIG friggin\u2019 difference.", "Happy belated birthday OP\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90", "It's called family counseling. They'll help the three of you work through it together. If your parents are employed with benefits, chances are they have access to at least a few free counseling/therapy sessions a year through what's called an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Their employer's HR dept will know about it as it is quite common.\n\nSounds like the problems you're facing with them are significant as is; and are going to get much worse as you grow older & achieve more milestones in life.", "Because they\u2019re bad parents and bad people. I have no patience for those who refuse therapy, especially when a child is involved. NTA but your parents fucked up with this one.", "Fair, but its not right to ignore the other child.", "Yeah you're gonna have to celebrate twice a hard, your parents have it backwards!\n\nI hope you have many wonderful birthdays in the future.  Sorry for your loss, NTA", "Its possible to be a grieving asshole. \n\nI saw something on FB the other day that said \"Your emotions are valid but your behavior is controllable\" and I feel that applies here. OP is NTA.", "The two aren't mutally exclusive", "In this case, they're both.", "I'm wondering how your dad/stepdad reacted to all this?", "Be happy that you have wonderful friends that are there for you.", "Not necessarily bad parents or people, but they are definitely hurting and acting like assholes toward their surviving child.", "And I never called the OP an AH.  In fact, I said she was NOT an AH.  Nobody in this situation is.", "Ever lost a 17 year old child?  No? Then sit down calling other people who have assholes.  Loss of a child is NOT NORMAL and expecting anything to be normal or controllable afterward is unreasonable.  You have no clue.", "Edited to remove an assumptive accusation based on receiving one.\n\nGrief can manifest itself in a LOT of ways and unfortunately sometimes that comes out as asshole behavior. Grief is not a \"do whatever you want with no repercussions\" card.", "Grieving does not give anybody the right to hurt others. It never has and it never will. If that\u2019s how certain hurt people cope, they need to find a healthier and different way to cope. And if they don\u2019t, then they should expect to see their lives deteriorate further.", "I have lost a child.  FO.", "I'm sorry for your loss; ill edit my previous comment to reflect that.\n\nBut now I'm wondering if you're saying grieving parents can't be assholes because you did/said something in your grief and you need to justify it."]}
