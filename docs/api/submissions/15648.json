Is your mom in therapy?  I'm sure a therapist would let her know how unhealthy it is to just ignore your birthday because of your sister's passing.  By the way, I am so sorry for your loss.  I can't even imagine.  You're right your sister would want you to still celebrate your life.  You're still a completely separate individual and you deserve to be celebrated.

They are people suffering unimaginable loss.  You are suffering unimaginable loss.  Give each other GRACE, and get some counseling for yourself and encourage your parents to do the same.

Sometimes people get wrapped up in their own grief and it\u2019s hard to see much else. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that is the response your received. You definitely aren\u2019t selfish. Your parents don\u2019t seem to be in the acceptance stage yet and that\u2019s very hard to cope with. I hope they get into therapy and talk to someone about this. This is a tragic loss that some families never recover from. \n\nBe strong for yourself and your family. Your parents will get better and when they do, they\u2019ll realize they still have a loving, wonderful daughter that they\u2019ve mistreated and will apologize. I know you need support too, keep talking to your therapist. Maybe they can shed some light on the situation to your parents and have them seek help. \n\nI\u2019ve lost a lot of loved ones. The closest to compare would my mother. When I was 9, my Nana passed and my Aunt when I was 15, I found her dead. My mother, sisters and cousins were all wrapped up in their own sadness that I was forgotten about. I stayed strong for everyone else. I was their shoulder to cry on. I never got to grieve properly. I\u2019m not saying take on this role. But if for a short time, be strong for you. It breaks your parents hearts when they see you because they see your sister too. Please know this is not something the internet can fix or validate for anyone involved. Please get your therapist talking to them.", "NTA.

Some family members don\u2019t mention them or celebrate important dates around their lives. I am the opposite, I talk about them, I celebrate them, and I remember them. My mom never mentions them so I am not sure if it\u2019s a temperament thing or a parent one. \nI have two children of my own and cannot imagine the pain of losing a child. I have somewhat normalized mentioning my sister and dad with her. We as an individual get to choose how we want to remember our loved ones.

I share my birthday with my younger sibling (I'm 3 years older, we're premie babies so my parents did NOT plan on a shared birthday), and when our older sister passed 3 years ago the day after our birthday (cancer sux), our mom has made every birthday (including the year sister died) all about our older sister. It's hard to celebrate your life when there's a huge gaping hole where a much beloved sibling should be but isn't. \n\nYour friends made sure to honor the gift that is YOU! That's what a birthday celebration is about, imo. I think of birthdays like this: Thank you for being born, growing up well, and being a part of my life; you've made my life better by being a part of it, and I'm immensely grateful for that gift.\n\nIt sucks that your parents are still struggling with their grief so much that it's robbing them and you of opportunities to bond and heal together, but you can only do your best to heal you and suggest they seek help in processing their grief and not failing you in the process.\n\nSending you hugs and good vibes and hope that healing happens and better days for you and your family ahead.", "NTA", "NTA", "You are NTA for enjoying a celebration with your friends who loved and knew your sister as well, even as you're all grieving.

I have a twin sister and also a little brother who passed away. His birthday is hard for me every year, but I like to make cupcakes and celebrate him even though he's not here. My birthday is also hard, because he's not here, but I have my sister. I don't know what my birthday would look like without her, but I do know that whatever you choose to do or not do isn't wrong. When someone is gone things are so hard and never quite right. The \"right\" thing would be for them to be with you, but they're not so you muddle through the best you can. \n\nI'm so glad your friends celebrated with you, and you had the chance to feel loved have support in an impossible time.  My parents have a very hard time acknowledging my brother's birthday, or his death. I don't talk to them on hard days. I go to therapy, but they won't and it's hard being a child who is still here and feeling like your parents aren't able to still see you. \n\nYou deserve to have a birthday and have people in your life who can both celebrate and mourn with you.  I hope you can remember and honor your twin and share her stories and when people sing happy birthday to you, you can still sing along and say her name. Time won't 'fix' the way you miss her, she will always be a part of you, but it will get better.

Losing my sister is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever gone through, even though it was over eight years ago. I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re in therapy (therapy is great!), and I\u2019m saddened to hear your parents are not in therapy yet, and I hope they\u2019ll come around. \n\nMy sister took her own life in 2013, shortly after her 18th birthday, and shortly before my 20th birthday. So every single year, fall rolls around and it\u2019s like \u201cher birthday, the anniversary of her suicide, other daughter\u2019s birthday\u201d all within about three weeks. For the first few years, my parents were so emotionally drained after my sister\u2019s birthday and anniversary there wasn\u2019t anything left in the tank for me, who was STILL ALIVE. \n\nI can\u2019t even begin to imagine how much harder it must be for you as a twin. \n\nWhat your friends did for you was so kind and loving, and I\u2019m glad you had that experience. When you feel ready, I would suggest writing a letter to your parents, doing your best to not say anything blaming, but only to communicate how you feel. \u201cWhen you said this, it made me feel XYZ.\u201d Not \u201cwhen you ruined my day\u201d etc. Writing may get through to them better than a conversation. Explain how you know they are grieving, and how you are ALSO grieving. Grief for the same person does not always show itself the same way, and between relationships (parent, sibling) it\u2019s quite unlikely. Goodness knows my parents grieved very differently from me, and even from each other. \n\nExplain how honoring your birthday reminds you of your sister and helps you process your love for her, with others who also loved her. Explain how you\u2019re still here, and you matter too, and deserve love and happiness. Happiness existing does not have to come at the expense of throwing away grief. They can coexist. You will likely always have a scar that hurts a little for your birthday, and I hope as the years pass, it won\u2019t be as all-encompassing for your parents. \n\nMy relationship with my mom didn\u2019t start to really improve until she FINALLY got a therapist about four years or more after my sister\u2019s death. It has made a world of difference. Staggeringly so. \n\nUltimately, *moving on isn\u2019t the same as letting go.* Happiness in the present can coexist with love in the past, and it will always be bittersweet. But that\u2019s just it. It\u2019s bitter*sweet,* not just bitter. \n\nI think time will help. And a letter. \n\nBest wishes to you.", "((OP)) If it is too painful for your parents to celebrate you on the actual day of your birth, pick another day.

You have good friends.", "I'm really sorry this happened to you. I lost my son 10 years ago when he was 20 so I have some sense of what your parents are going through.\n\nThat being said, I found one of the best questions I've had for people who get lost in their grief or can't imagine moving forward is to ask them \"If the situation was reversed, and you died instead of <name>, would you want us all to still be sad and in pain a year after you died?\"\n\nThe answer of course is absolutely not. No one wants their loved ones to be sad or grieving for years.\n\nSo besides family therapy, what we did that helped our family was to create rituals around important dates. Mostly we make charitable contributions to organizations that were important to our son. That way, when it's Christmas or his birthday, we are doing something to both honor and remember him. \n\nFinally, please keep encouraging your parents or all of you to get counseling. Most therapists have sliding scales if money is an issue. There is also the Compassionate Friend's organization.

I am so sorry your parents can\u2019t seem to take time out to recognize that you need support outside of therapy. For me, accepting that it\u2019s not all therapy and analyzing issues and deep in the trauma complexities is the easy part. It\u2019s hard for me not to get stuck there.

I\u2019m going to ask you to show grace. Yes, you lost your twin, but they also lost a child. Maybe they feel guilty celebrating life, when your twin can\u2019t.

She was probably hit with a lot of emotions when she realized your friends were having a birthday party for you. She was reminded that your twin is not having a birthday party, and will never have another. She's grieving, so her actions were understandable. That does not mean she was correct to speak to you that way. You can understand why someone does something without agreeing with what they did. Your family suffered a huge loss and you're all processing it the best you can. This was one of the horrible firsts that people experience after a death. It's okay to have a lot of emotions about it.

I only realized that after having my own children. From your description it seems like this is the first birthday after your sister passed. It must sting them so hard and they are probably still so caught up in their own grief that they are failing their living child and can't even notice it.\n\nIf you have close family members you can talk to, it should help as well.

You have lost your twin and best friend, and you have struggled trying to deal with this, and you must feel very alone, because of your loss, but also because your parents, in their grief, have somewhat abandoned you too.  You say that you are seeing a counsellor, but it is also very important that your parents have grief counselling too.  When grief hits, it\u2019s not uncommon for people shut down.  They sometimes can\u2019t or don\u2019t communicate properly with each other, especially when it comes to talking about the person who was lost. \n\nIt\u2019s a difficult time for all of you, but in spite of that, I disagree with your mother\u2019s response.

It\u2019s like she\u2019s pushing you away.  It\u2019s a very unhealthy path for your relationship.  You are not selfish.  I\u2019m going to now suggest something that may not be a popular idea.  Whilst you \u201cshould\u201d have your birthday acknowledged each year, I think you would be better off from now on to  not expect it, because you don\u2019t know how long this mindset within your mother is going to last, and because I don\u2019t want you to be berated every year and feel abandoned like this.  Your friends were very kind to bring you cupcakes this year, but it may be best to get together elsewhere next time, unless there is some adjustment to the situation on your parents side.  I hate to say it but sometimes you have to set the bar low, and you might be pleasantly surprised if they raise it.  You have good friends.  Talk to your therapist about what happened on your birthday, and strategies for the future.  There will be other milestones too, like graduation, getting married, etc that will bring up these issues in your parents again, when you should be able to celebrate.

It might never be easy, but it does get easier. Sorry for your loss, and happy birthday OP.", "One child is dead. Your parents have no reason to bury two. Which is what they\u2019re doing emotionally \n\nThey can grieve but they shouldn\u2019t expect their other children/child to stop existing, feeling and needing\n\nYe\u2014the grief will never go away.

It's heart breaking that you lost your twin sister and I'm really sorry for your loss. And it must be hard for your parents too but they should cherish their child who is still here in this world. Happy belated birthday OP \u2764\ufe0f", "Happy Birthday for an internet stranger.  NTA.", "NTA! Your parents sound seriously unhinged. Please get away from them as soon as you are able. I'm so sorry for your loss. If you can, get someone to talk to that ISNT Them", "NTA, you're having very appropriate feelings about the situation, i.e. \"it's complicated\". You're entitled to celebrate your birthday, even when you're sad it's a reminder of the sister you loved and lost. We should remember the good about the people we loved and lost. Most gatherings in my area to remember someone who died are now called a \"celebration of life\", to remind us to celebrate the life they lived, and to be thankful for the time they had with us.", "NTA. Just because one daughter is gone doesn\u2019t mean they can ignore the other one. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, and I\u2019m sorry your parents are so wrapped up in their grief that they can\u2019t see how they are hurting you.", "So very sorry for your loss. That 1st year is extraordinarily tough on everyone but still not an excuse for your parents to fail to acknowledge that it is your birthday. Mom should not have reacted as she did but please try and cut her some slack as there is no loss like that if a child. You had every right to that small celebration and I am glad you had good friends that understood what a tough day it was for you.", "NTA. Life should still be celebrated. I think your sister would want that for you.", "NTA", "NTA- not even close. You deserve to be celebrated and loved and cherished, even more so now that you\u2019ve lost someone who was such a part of you. Sending you all my love. I hope your parents can deal with their grief so that they do not push you away.", "NTA and what you told your mom is absolutely the truth. You are still here and should be celebrated. Of course the loss of your twin will always be difficult. But focus on the living.", "Reminds me of an AITA post a few weeks back about a family whose \"tradition\" was to not celebrate anything family milestones or achievements at all because OP's brother died like 15 years prior.", "Exactly what I wanted to say. NTA.\n\nAnd I apologize for how blunt this is going to sound, but your sister passed away, not you. It's not your fault and you don't deserve punishment for it. But you have a whole life to live and your parents need to let you have a happy one that isn't all about mourning.", "They definitely do. Losing a child is one of the most traumatic things that can happen to a person, and it\u2019s putting strain on their relationship with each other and with you because they are struggling to process that grief. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, OP. My great aunt had a really hard time losing her twin when they were 65: it would be so much worse at 16.", "As a parent, one of my responsibilities is to find healthy ways of dealing with the less enjoyable emotions of parenting that don\u2019t involve dumping on my kids. That might be a psych, it might be a parenting group, it might be friends, whatever. \n\nYou are NTA because you shouldn\u2019t be crippling your life because your mother hasn\u2019t come up with a healthy way of working through her own very real grief. You can\u2019t be her counsellor; it\u2019s poor parenting to dump that on you.", "I adopted my identical twin nieces. They are now 38. They have five toddlers between them. One another set of identical twin girls. I promise you - if something happened to one they would want the other  to continue to live their life in the fullest way possible and full of love. As a Mom, losing one of them is an unbearable thought but the sister left would be more embraced and celebrated than ever. All the best to you \u2764\ufe0f and I hope your parents get some help sweetheart.", "i disagree about showing the reddit post. What i would advise to do is talk with your therapist, and ask if they can write a letter to the parents explaining that they also (probably more so than the daughter) need therapy. Not with the same therapist, but hearing it from an expert is far better than \"mom, the internet said I'm right!\", because to her this will probably only seem like kids OP's age are writing all the answers here and have no experience. A therapist on the other hand has an actual degree proving expertise in the field.", "This made me cry. You\u2019re great. \ud83d\ude00", "That was beautiful ... I'm crying. Thank you.", "And even when it comes to the day of someone's passing, things can coincide. \n\nLike how my grandfather died on his youngest daughter's birthday.", "That's pretty good suggestion.", "Oh, cheer up. My post wasn't that bad.", "Lol. \ud83d\ude04", "Must be nice to be so black and white about things like this.  Empathy is lost on you.", "NTA, yesterday was my birthday too, so Happy Birthday to both of us! And I'm grieving as well because my father just passed away last week (not unexpectedly, he was elderly and his health has been failing for a while, it was just a matter of time). My father also had an identical twin brother who passed away several years ago, just two weeks before a milestone birthday that we were planning a big celebration for. So we still celebrated my father's birthday, it just was a lot more quiet and subdued. Just because your twin passed doesn't mean that cancels out your existence. You are very right here, and you have good friends. You can be grieving but still living your life. Your parents, frankly, need professional help. Losing a child is traumatic and can break marriages apart, it's not fair that they want you to put your life in a static hold because they haven't worked out their issues. I've noticed many times people who accuse others of being \"selfish\" are actually the selfish one. Your mom saw you acting in a way to alleviate your own pain, which wasn't in a way she wanted, so she got mad at you. Do you see? She wanted you to behave the way SHE envisioned, and when you didn't, she called you selfish, when it's actually HER (it's an ego defense mechanism call \"projection\")  \nYou have a right to feel how you want to feel, and not even your parents can dictate those to you. Honestly, I'd advise you to see if you have a family member or friend's place that you could stay at for a month or two and tell your parents to concentrate on themselves and get their marriage sorted, one way or the other.  \nNTA, good luck and Happy Birthday!", "I'm so sorry OP I genuinely sympathize, your situation is very unfortunate. You should still be able to celebrate your birthday, although of course it will never be the same. Although you have had a really horrible experience, you are still allowed to try and be happy on your birthday, it is okay to still attempt to somewhat get on with life and try to be happy which I expect is very very hard.\n\nNTA.", "NTA    \nGrieving is tough and everyone handles it differently.  You're allowed to grieve in your own way.  However, don't fault them for not wanting to celebrate, those first birthdays and holidays without someone is rough, especially for a parent who loses a child, so allow them some grace.  But realize that you did nothing wrong here and you're allowed to celebrate your birthday with your friends.  You're also justified in being upset that they didn't acknowledge your birthday.  I think you and your parents definitely need family therapy to try and work through things.", "As someone who has also lost someone very, very near to me, I know your twin wants you to celebrate your birthday. The day you two were born was probably the happiest day of your mom's life. The day your twin passed was probably the darkest day of her life. Some marriages don't survive the loss of a child. Why is she angry?  A friend of mine said she got angry at her husband for not wanting to discuss their loss. I don't know your mom. I wish you a happy birthday. Find some grief therapy you can attend. Maybe take your mom. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. I\u2019m a twin, and my twin is in the military. While I haven\u2019t lost him, it\u2019s a possibility me and my parents are aware of. While it\u2019s devastating and I don\u2019t even like to imagine it, you\u2019re still here and celebrating y\u2019all\u2019s birthday is a great way to honor her memory. Y\u2019all shared this, it\u2019s belonged to both of you, and not celebrating it not only hurts you, but I doubt it\u2019s what your twin would have wanted. Your parents need therapy and you\u2019re not selfish. Take care of yourself and your mental health please", "Definitely NTA. You can mourn the loss of your sister while still celebrating your own life. What are your parents going to do when you move out and be on your own? They can't stop you from living your life and celebrating anything you want. I'm very sorry for theirs and your loss, but they need to differentiate between you two and realize you guys aren't the same entity because you're twins", "NTA - you have good friends and shitty parents", "NTA and just wanted to point out how sweet your friends sound. They are keepers!", "NTA. I lost my younger cousin (very close, practically my younger sister), and our birthdays were a few days (not years) apart. From 15-18 I turned a year older a month before my actual birthdate, and it had very lasting negative impacts on me (nearly 24 and still hung up about what this did to me). I was called selfish, and inconsiderate, all while I was grieving and wanting to return to something normal. So please, celebrate your life. Have fun, be a teenager, invite your friends over, or go out. Your sister is celebrating with you <3", "I am an identical twin and literally can't imagine what you're going through. I'm so sorry for your loss. Your sister would want you to be happy and to celebrate", "Clearly NTA - Sorry for your loss OP. I hope your parents get some help so you all are able to celebrate you both in future years.", "NTA!, i'm so sorry your parents are being like this, i understand how they feel but as you said, they still have you and should celebrate the fact, your sister would have wanted that, i'm proud of your friends for doing that for you.", "You did nothing wrong. Absolutely NTA. That was her grief speaking. You've had therapy, but have they? Because it sounds like they need it.\n\nGrief stays with you, but it gets less disabling as time goes on, and celebrating your birthday is a great first step.\n\nYou can't live your life as though any celebration is a betrayal of your twin. She would want you to thrive and be joyful.", "100% what I was here to say. My God! I get we all grieve differently, but to say such hurtful and harmful things to your living daughter. So distasteful. I'd 100% leave when I turned 18 or even right then for that matter. I guarantee one of those friends parents would take her in. You can't take words back. I think people forget that. I've always strived to never say anything to my kids, spouse, friends, or anyone I care about during anger. You can't take it back once it's said.", "I know my parents must be struggling a lot with grief because they lost and child and that shouldn't happen parents shouldn't have to go through losing a child but I think sometimes they don't think of my grief \n\nWe shared a room because as toddlers we refused to sleep in separate rooms \n\nWe had different interests and extracurricular activities but always were at each other's events and supported each other so it's hard doing things without her support \n\nI also just miss being able to talk to her about anything and everything any time I want to \n\nI miss just laughing with her \n\nI could go on and on but my life is completely different without her in it because part of me is missing", "It would have probably been better to celebrate elsewhere.", "As  a fellow bereaved parent I understand why they behaved that way.  They aren\u2019t even a year out.  I hope you never have to truly understand", "a kid shouldn\u2019t have to not celebrate their birthday because of their parents. grief is an awful thing but the parents still have a duty to the kid that is alive regardless"]}
