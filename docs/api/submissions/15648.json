I said well it's my birthday too and I miss my sister so much today's been really hard for me but you and Dad act like today just isn't our birthday you still have me you should still acknowledge I'm here.

First, I am sorry for your loss but cannot imagine your sister would want you live a life of mourning.  Hoping she was there in spirit.", "NTA. Firstly, I'm sorry for you loss, secondly im positive that your sister would want you to be happy. I understand your parents are upset and miss her, but that's no excuse to just pretend that a birthday doesn't exist and not acknowledge their daughter, who's also hurting.", "NTA. They've lost one child, now she's trying to push another one away", "NTA, I'm so sorry for your loss and can't imagine what you must be going through, but I am speechless. You are absolutely right that, while mourning is important, your parents should be sensitive to your loss as well. I'd suggest therapy for all of you so that you can have a neutral party help put things into perspective.", "definitely NTA. I'm sure this is a hard time for your parents, but they really failed you. I'm glad to hear your friends came by to celebrate your birthday. they are good friends.", "Your parents are a-holes you have the right to celebrate your birthday\n\nNTA", "WTF. Absolutely NTA. End of story", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nNTA  you have some great friends. Your parents are not thinking clearly thru their grief. I hope that changes soon.", "NTA\n\nYour parents and maybe you too need grief counseling.  They need to celebrate the life of the child still living.  It's a good life and still deserving of joy.", "NTA--Wow NTA buy a landslide.  I get your mom is grieving but she also has to remember she has a living daughter that she needs to be present for.   Is your mom in therapy?  I'm sure a therapist would let her know how unhealthy it is to just ignore your birthday because of your sister's passing.  By the way, I am so sorry for your loss.  I can't even imagine.  You're right your sister would want you to still celebrate your life.  You're still a completely separate individual and you deserve to be celebrated.  Sounds like your mom is lashing out at you due to her grief which isn't fair at all.  You said \"parents\" so I'm wondering how your dad/stepdad reacted to all this?", "NTA.  Your family needs help.\n\nIts your birthday, celebrate. If thats what your sister would want, then party it up for both of you!", "NTA, it's your birthday as well as your sister's", "NTA. Go out and celebrate, you lost your sister and that's a loss you will always feel but that doesn't mean that you should stop living and enjoying your life. Be patient with your parents they may need time and help from a professional. Be happy that you have wonderful friends that are there for you.", "NTA. And your parents are going to lose both their kids if they don't stop with this.", "1000% NTA\n\nWow, your parents need to get a grip and realize that whatever pain they\u2019re feeling, you\u2019re feeling it, too, but at the age of 17. When you still need your parents\u2019 support. They\u2019re the ones who are supposed to shepherd you through the loss of your sister!\n\nSounds like maybe your very presence triggers your parents in the same way that your shared birthday does. It is mind-boggingly insensitive to call you out for *receiving the love and kindness of your awesome and thoughtful friends*!\n\nYour parents should have been celebrating you and loving on you and telling you how grateful they are to have you with them this whole time and *most especially today.* \n\nInstead, they are busy confirming your deepest fear: that they feel weird about you as just you, that you remind them of your late sister, and that they are putting emotional distance in between you and them because of the memories you stir up.\n\nOP, please tell your parents how much you need them, and how much they need you. Ask them to go to therapy on their own. Ask them to put you in therapy. Ask for family therapy. Help them snap back into the reality that one of their precious twin babies is still very much alive and available to be loved, and that their deceased child would want nothing more than for all of the love they had saved up for her to be poured out onto her surviving twin.\n\nBe well. And cling tight to your friends. They\u2019re keepers.", "NTA. Your parents need to get into therapy", "NTA. I am sorry for your loss. You didn't plan this. You and your sisters friends probably also needed to celebrate. Maybe it was part of their grieving process. And how long would your parents think was \"long enough\" to not celebrate? It sounds like a slippery slope. I hope they can end up processing as they need with the help they need. Happy belated birthday to you as well.", "NTA. I can't even imagine the loss of a child but your parents are being massively unreasonable\n\nIt's ok to celebrate your birthday and frankly, I think it's unfair of them to not even acknowledge your birthday. Do they expect you to never celebrate ever again? \n\nI can see in another comment that you're in therapy. Perhaps your therapist can assist with getting your parents to speak to someone professionally.", "You are NTA, but your parents need to understand that, if they refuse to celebrate anything in your life again, because your sister isn\u2019t there to celebrate also, that they\u2019ll end up losing both their daughters.", "Firstly, I'm so sorry for your loss.  That's a hard one.\n\nSecondly, no matter how despondent your parents must feel over the loss of your sister, they need to accept that you're still here.  Their refusal to acknowledge your birthday is the selfish act here, not your acceptance of your friends' thoughtfulness and generosity.\n\nWhat you're dealing with is not fair and not right, and your mom ought to feel ashamed for ignoring your birthday and denying its importance to you.\n\nNTA", "Happy birthday.\n\nNTA, big time.", "Definitely NTA. I am so sorry for your loss, but life goes on. Your parents are wrong here.", "Most definitely NTA\n\nReally sorry to hear how your mom behaved with you. Please don't be hard on yourself. You're all understandably going through a difficult time and it's good to know that you're slowly accepting life without your sister.", "NTA - your therapist will help you unpack this, but this is their grief manifesting in a way that is unfair to you. Your joy does not have to be stifled. And selfish? Please. As if you could ever have a birthday where you didn\u2019t think of your twin anyways! Of course you are thinking about her, but that does not mean you aren\u2019t allowed to celebrate yourself and your birthday however you want. I\u2019m so glad your friends were there for you. \n\nYou are working through your grief with the help of a therapist. They aren\u2019t. Their reactions aren\u2019t healthy, but you can\u2019t convince them of that. They need to do the work on their own.", "NTA. Grief is hard, but you deserve to be celebrated on your birthday!   They need to show up for you.", "NTA, your parents need therapy just as much as you do to cope with the 2 basic facts that life moves on whether they like it or not, AND you can't always  be in constant mourning just because you share a birthday with your twin. \n\n\nI understand the eternal pain of losing a child but your parents also need understand that you are alive and it unwise of them to treat you like your dead, because then they will eventually lose all their children - your sister is already gone due death and they will lose you due to getting beyond with how they treating you so negatively.", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, I can\u2019t imagine the pain of losing a sibling, especially a twin. However you are still alive and your parents should acknowledge it. They definitely need that therapy ! Happy late birthday to you !", "NTA, it wasn't right for your mother to take out her grief on you. The day was also your birthday, so you get to celebrate it. Maybe it made it easier for your parents that they pretended it wasn't your birthday, but they forgot that you are their child too and they have responsibility for your well-being too.\r  \n\r  \nIt's hard for your parents to adapt to the new reality, so don't be afraid to rely on other adults in your life as well.", "NTA. Losing your twin sister must have been incredibly hard, and it is up to you how to handle that. It seems that you are making an effort to carry on and have a life of your own, good on you! If you had decided never to celebrate your birthday for the rest of your life, equally good! One way or the other, it is YOUR decision to make. Of course the whole situation is hard on your parents as well, who have lost a daughter. Out of consideration to them, you could celebrate your birthday somewhere else, in a pub or at a friends place.\n\nAnyway, it often happens that parents get so caught up in grieving for a lost child that they forget their other children who are still alive. Don't let that happen to you OP!", "NTA,  your parents are being unreasonable. yes you are still here and they should be working harder to make your day more special.   ignoring the fact, they lost a child and you lost your sister is not going to help anyone in the long run.   You keep celebrating and you keep your sister in your hart while doing so.   You have a great group of friends, It was really good of them to remember your birthday and help you get through the day.", "NTA and Happy Birthday.\n\nDon't worry that everyone's emotions are muddled.  It is to be expected.\n\nIt's going to take you, and your family and friends, a while to sort this out.  How to mark the date of your birthday, both celebrating another year of your life and honoring the memory of your sister. \n\nNew ritual is needed.\n\nPerhaps split the day.  In the morning, maybe you and your family and friends go out to brunch, to share a meal and remember your sister, and maybe visit her grave.  In the afternoon or evening have a dinner-time party  to celebrate your birthday.\n\nTalk about this with your parents, in a week or so once you've all recovered from the emotions of this birthday.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry for your loss", "NTA, I am a fellow twinless twin.  I lost my twin at 19.  Instead of ignoring our birthday, I call it \"celebrating for us both\" (which yes, occasionally means I overindulged).  On the flip side, I have another twinless friend that tries to ignore his birthday.  It's not about what your parents think, this is about you and how you choose to honor your twin/your day.\n\n(FYI, there's a r/TwinlessTwins group if you want additional support)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In addition to talking to your therapist, are there any other adults you can reach out to? Share with them how your mother responded and ask them to urge your parents to get therapy. \n\nSome people respond to grief in harmful and destructive ways - punishing themselves and blaming others.

How hard it must be for you- huge hugs!!\n\nYour friends were really thoughtful, and you did nothing wrong in celebrating your birthday. It\u2019s okay to feel happy. Celebrating your birthday doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t miss your sister, and finding pockets of happiness in sad times is healthy. \n\nIt sounds as if your mom thinks you should grieve or feel the same way she does, but everyone grieves differently. Your mom pushed her own feelings of not wanting to celebrate onto you and shamed you for being happy.

With the way the parents are acting, they may as well act like both of their daughters passed away.  I would want to celebrate the living twin's birthday while also finding a way to honor the twin that passed away.  \n\nI'm a mom with a 10 year old daughter.  She's sentimental and sensitive.  She mentions how much I mean to her all the time and how much she will miss me when I pass.  I try to always remind her that I'll never be far and I'll want he to be as happy as can be.  I'll be watching and waiting for her in Heaven.  Obviously not everyone believes in God but we do and it does bring her some comfort.", "That's kinda what I wanted to do was celebrate for both my sister and I", "You're a good kid. I don't know if you need to hear that or not.

You are NTA in any way and your friends rule.  Your parents have emotional tunnel vision so it\u2019s probably hard for them to see that they are making things more difficult for you also.", "It may be good to explain if they treat you this way, you will exit their lives as well.", "Great post!  Maybe she could even ask therapist that she's seeing for ideas or maybe can bring her mom/both parents to a session to get the message about what's healthy when it comes to grieving."]}
