We can call my brother Matthew for anonymity's sake. To get ahead of some of the most commonly asked questions - We're identical. We do things in sync sometimes, but I don't know if it's any more common than two people who just spend a lot of time together and adopt each other's mannerisms. I would absolutely say that the twin intuition thing is real. We have two older brothers and I love them, but I'm not as close to them as I am Matthew. We have never been away from each other for longer than maybe three days. We don't technically live together but we stay in the same apartment building for college and often just fall asleep at each other's places.\r  \n\r  \nMy girlfriend (24F) and I have been long distance for basically our entire relationship. I'm busy with school and the music me and Matthew work on together, she lives about two hours away and is busy with her job and her grad program. To make a long, somewhat confusing explanation short, she's staying with me for the summer, working shorter hours remotely while she fulfills an in person grad school requirement at the university I currently attend. Most of her grad program has been online, this section is not.\r  \n\r  \nIt's her capstone project and doing it during the summer basically means she's doing it in double time so she really has to buckle down and work. I get that. Still, the way she's been treating my brother isn't cool with me. She often rolls her eyes and shuts herself in our guest bedroom when she comes home and sees that he's over. We smoke together and fuck around on guitars together while we work on music, things she used to be fond of but now seems to hate. \r  \n\r  \nThe final straw came last week when I got a phone call while I was out of her freaking out. She had refused to let my brother in the apartment so he used the key I had given him, and she lost it. She said her boundaries weren't being respected and that I needed to kick him out. Instead, I told her she needs to leave.\r  \n\r  \nShe's furious, saying she can't find somewhere else to stay on such short notice and I'm fucking up the most important class of her life, saying I'm too codependent on my brother, and that I should have never told her she could stay when I knew she needed to work and I wasn't allowing her to do so.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r  \n\r", "created_utc": 1689114572, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x5q59/aita_for_kicking_my_girlfriend_out_in_the_middle/", "score": 4616, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She works hard, and wants to come home and relax in your's and her space but isn't able to some or most of the time (depends how much Matthew is visiting).

Giving out private information is absolutely harm, it can do a lot of damage.", "I am 100% with you, and was completely dismayed by the number of BuT sHe NeEdEd To VeNt people. Yeah we need to vent, but if you\u2019re doing it like that you\u2019re doing it wrong. Your mandatory yearly HIPAA training makes sure you know that.", "yes same \ud83d\ude02 i was like he tryna parent trap her ass \ud83d\ude2d", "if by getting with a guy you mean making a soccer team then yes \ud83e\udd23", "A person living there who has a right to privacy and safety where she lives. Being a twin isn\u2019t an excuse. It was different before isn\u2019t an excuse. He did it knowing full well that she didn\u2019t want him there and he pushed in anyway.", "You can be as comfy and happy with your brother as you want but being in a relationship also requires you to understand it's not all about your own happiness and comfort. You can't pretend your partner to be as comfortable around your family as you are. \n\nNow,  OP doesnt seem too distress about this breakup, but eventually him or his brother will find someone they really don't want to lose. What will happen then when they demand some boundaries, if you basically educated your brother to barge in as he pleases with no consideration of your partner needs? \n\nOr OP will end up breaking up with every person who basically doesnt want to be in a threesome, or he will have to set those limits pretty drastically later on, maybe even putting in jeopardy his relationship with his brother in the process.\n\nHonestly, everything about his post screams that there's some serious growing up needed.", "I was leaning more towards ESH, with a slight lean to NTA. He asked her to stop and she brushed him off. Regardless of what they're talking about, that's disrespectful as fuck. But also he didn't need anyone to intervene, he can just walk away if she starts talking about it.", "You don't need to scroll just click the Sort By button under where it's been deleted and click old and the deleted comment comes up", "I know and I agree. It was really shocking to see the comment section. I did not expect to see anyone defending the wife, maybe sympathizing with her but not defending her and lambasting the OP.", "I wouldn't describe it like that at all. She was leaking details such that he knew medical details of people they both knew that they'd almost certainly not want others to know. He said he basically begged her to stop sharing these details and as a last resort finally asked a friend of her to talk to HER. The friend instead went to the hospital.\n\nNot wanting your wife to keep breaking the law and leak you medical details of people you know when you keep asking them not to is not unreasonable.", "Yeah, what he did sucks but she shouldn't be telling him personal information about patients that he knew personally. That's a huge ethical violation, which he told her repeatedly he didn't want to be part of, so she doesn't exactly sound like a prize either. My personal information was shared by a healthcare professional and I can assure you that is a whole new horrific level of betrayel.", "I mean, anyone who works in healthcare gets lectured up and down on HIPAA and how you don't share information about a patient so she kinda made her own bed there.", "He asked a coworker to speak to his wife. Perhaps in another situation it would be analogous to asking his wife's friend to talk to her. However the coworker had a professional duty to report the wife, so it directly lead to her being disciplined. But it was certainly phrased not as \"reporting\" but rather \"can you talk to her about this?\"\n\nIf you read the thread, people accused him of doing it on purpose to take down his wife or something. Even that he failed med school himself and wanted revenge. I think he's just dumb and didn't realize it would blow up like that lol, but people want the drama.", "He didn't report her, he asked a friend of his wife to try to get her to understand what she was doing was wrong after begging her not to do it and it falling on deaf ears. Instead of talking to his wife the friend went to the hospital to tell them about it.", "He didn't say he would tell anyone. But he did repeatedly ask her to stop doing it.", "He did, he asked her to stop, that she was breaking HIPAA. Showed her that she was breaking HIPAA by going over it with her. Wife just brushed him off saying everyone does it. He went to one of the colleagues asking them to explain to her how she is breaking HIPAA and that it is a very big deal. Colleague reported the wife.   \n\n\nFrankly the comment section was insane. People defended the wife when he was able to identify patients from the info she was sharing. My mother is a nurse and yeah she vents but it\u2019s never information where I could identify someone.", "I know it was really surprising. I have a number of doctors in my family who don't do that, so I thought that was what was normal, but the comment section made me scared", "WTF?! Please tell me you reported her.", "An ex boyfriend had his teen cousin come visit his dad from out of state. The cousin had a STD test done and Planned Parenthood called the house phone. They told the kid\u2019s dad he had chlamydia.", "Me too. I\u2019m not from the US, but our Privacy Act and Health Information Privacy Code within it is pretty similar to HIPAA in the restrictions on healthcare providers and if this happened here and the patient found out about it & complained it could get the provider and the practice they work at hauled before the Health and Disability Commissioner and potentially sanctioned.", "I mean, I work with *animals* and I STILL don't give enough info in my stories to identify the pet owners in question. When I want to tell a fun story, I leave out AS MUCH INFO AS POSSIBLE for the story to still make sense, and if I can't do that without leaving in identifiable info, then I don't tell the story to anyone but coworkers.", "She also confirmed to him the full name of the patient he knew when he realised who it was so there could be absolutely no doubt. Healthcare providers do occasionally rant if they had a particularly difficult patient but any decent one will only do so if they\u2019re absolutely confident that the person could not possibly be identified, and if there\u2019s any inkling that their partner might possibly know the person they would keep their mouths shut. \n\nTreating people and learning about their most intimate health information is a privilege and the wife ruined her own career by proving that she cannot be trusted with that information. It\u2019s extremely important that people feel that they can trust the health system, because distrust can have catastrophic consequences for themselves and their families, and that\u2019s why there has to be zero tolerance for anything that undermines that trust.", "He went to a friend of his wife asking them to have a word with his wife. That person instead went to the hospital. I was leaning more towards NTA as she was intentionally putting him in a bad position that he time after time begged her not to. \n\nIt wouldn't exactly be great for hte marriage if he ran away with his fingers in his ears every time she started talking about work. Fact is she refused to listen and said it wasn't an issue, he hoped a friend within the professional could get her to listen and realise she was wrong, it backfired. He did need someone to intervene, he picked the wrong person though.", "Exactly.  She gave specific enough information that he was nearly sure he knew who she was talking about.  He asked her repeatedly to stop telling him details about her patients.  Repeatedly.  It was just wild.  Now, he should expect to be divorced and maybe he should have warned her about the fact he was going to tell on her, but nevertheless, she sucked.", "Clarification - that friend was the mom of the kid who was in the hospital.  She never gave the husband names or that kind of info, he just, as he put it, \"figured it out\".\n\nAlso sorry to say but, he's complicit.  He has the power to be an ass and insist on her stopping.  The only way he could've found those details is by letting her talk, while simultaneously saying \"stop babe plz\" but letting her talk over him.", "When your partner disrespects your boundaries you don't go rat her out in a way that destroys their career... You work on it, or you leave.", "When my wife was in the hospital with a very troubled pregnancy (we ended up having an emergency c-section at 20 weeks and lost the baby after 2 days), both her sister and sister's husband worked for the hospital. They started discussing my wife's medical info with her parents and blaming my wife's bad eating habits for the problems. My wife ate like garbage prior to our marriage, but she completely changed that when she got pregnant the first time (this was pregnancy 3). Her eating habits weren't the problem. Nevertheless, their meddling caused a fight with her parents and additional stress on my wife. I gave my brother in law one warning and told him that any further discussion of my wife's medical info with anyone who didn't have a distinct need to know and I would report him and raise a stink to get him fired.", "She wasn't telling him personal information. She was just telling him about her cases she was dealing with. Not names and stuff.", "A lot of AITAs are about people who are technically in the right about something but escalate things or act passive aggressively. I just can't imagine not explicitly warning someone before taking that step.", "It just seems like there's a missing step here. I am guessing his goal wasn't to punish her, it was to get her to stop and understand her mistake. I would warn someone before escalating and involving a colleague even if I knew I was 100% right.", "I know my mom is a nurse and it did to me too.", "I have to go through HIPAA training every year for my job and this is what we\u2019re taught. We also have separate confidentiality rules that say we shouldn\u2019t discuss our clients at all, even without any identifying info. But it wouldn\u2019t violate HIPAA to do so.", "Did you know there are 18 identifiers including zip code depending on the size of the town? Much more than name and dob. If you can identify the patient\u2026.then there was identifying information.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in a place to identify what does and does not breach the Act when you don\u2019t even know its name. It\u2019s the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), not HIPPA.", "It was identifying information being included, in the post homieo says it's enough to figure out the relatives of friends that are going to the hospital, stop defending someone leaking private information. It's the exact same as having your medical records posted online.", "I didn\u2019t. Back then, I didn\u2019t know anything about HIPAA and privacy laws. But honestly even if I did know, I don\u2019t know if I would have reported her. I was reeling from my dad\u2019s death and going through so much shit at home and in my personal life at the same time, my mental health was really bad and was not in healthy place.", "Omg that\u2019s awful", "Exactly what I mean. She just screwed up big by doing this, I would have done the same if I was the husbands position. I've been around healthcare because of a good portion of my family needing medical help, learned from them and other posts similar to the situation. One was the OP's sis blabbing about health crud she wanted quiet and found out sister's friend also happened to be the....nurse? I think? And was violating Hippa up the wazoo.", "Appreciate you explaining!", "She was breaking the law plain and simple - people like her are why this law exists. She probably tells more than just him about patients if she really goes into that much detail. She's very much the AH. He did probably earn himself a divorce, but I wouldn't want to be married to someone like that anyway.", "It was enough he was able to identify someone. If he could identify someone on a first guess she was giving too much information.", "She was venting about cases she couldn't stop thinking about and he guessed who one of the patients was from incidental details. She overshared, but probably didn't violate HIPPA (it's debatable, I'll admit), but he should NEVER have betrayed his wife that way. Also, ironically, I bet that someone from the residency program will have seen the post and know that he blabbed on the Internet.", "He said he THOUGHT he was able to identify who a patient was. We have no clue whether he actually identified anyone. The OP in that post felt like an unreliable narrator.", "I remember that post! Genuinely a horrifying situation for the poor OP to be in, the sister told the whole family too iirc? And then got angry because the OP complained to her nurse best friend\u2019s workplace about it and the nurse was fired?"]}
