We can call my brother Matthew for anonymity's sake. To get ahead of some of the most commonly asked questions - We're identical. We do things in sync sometimes, but I don't know if it's any more common than two people who just spend a lot of time together and adopt each other's mannerisms. I would absolutely say that the twin intuition thing is real. We have two older brothers and I love them, but I'm not as close to them as I am Matthew. We have never been away from each other for longer than maybe three days. We don't technically live together but we stay in the same apartment building for college and often just fall asleep at each other's places.\r  \n\r  \nMy girlfriend (24F) and I have been long distance for basically our entire relationship. I'm busy with school and the music me and Matthew work on together, she lives about two hours away and is busy with her job and her grad program. To make a long, somewhat confusing explanation short, she's staying with me for the summer, working shorter hours remotely while she fulfills an in person grad school requirement at the university I currently attend. Most of her grad program has been online, this section is not.\r  \n\r  \nIt's her capstone project and doing it during the summer basically means she's doing it in double time so she really has to buckle down and work. I get that. Still, the way she's been treating my brother isn't cool with me. She often rolls her eyes and shuts herself in our guest bedroom when she comes home and sees that he's over. We smoke together and fuck around on guitars together while we work on music, things she used to be fond of but now seems to hate. \r  \n\r  \nThe final straw came last week when I got a phone call while I was out of her freaking out. She had refused to let my brother in the apartment so he used the key I had given him, and she lost it. She said her boundaries weren't being respected and that I needed to kick him out. Instead, I told her she needs to leave.\r  \n\r  \nShe's furious, saying she can't find somewhere else to stay on such short notice and I'm fucking up the most important class of her life, saying I'm too codependent on my brother, and that I should have never told her she could stay when I knew she needed to work and I wasn't allowing her to do so.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r  \n\r", "created_utc": 1689114572, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x5q59/aita_for_kicking_my_girlfriend_out_in_the_middle/", "score": 2276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe she didn\u2019t mind so much about the hanging out before because she wasn\u2019t living there. And maybe you should have discussed what living together, even temporarily, would be like.

She works hard, and wants to come home and relax in your's and her space but isn't able to some or most of the time (depends how much Matthew is visiting). But finally, he shouldn't have a key if he doesn't live there, or at least if he does, he shouldn't use it to enter against anyone's wishes. \n\nUltimately, I think your problem is that the long-term relationship suited you, because it meant you could kind of have the best of both worlds - a relationship, but also lots of time to spend with your brother.

You obviously do not care about her at all. It\u2019s really simple but I guess a couple of knuckleheads can\u2019t come to the very simple conclusion to use your brother\u2019s apartment to dick around for the summer especially while your girlfriend is in the room and working.

The very least you could do is let her stay with you for the rest of her program and have some respect for her.

She never asked you to choose between them, she just needs space and he literally lives in the same complex. He could have waited for you at his place.

You tell him,  boyfriend is not here, what do you want? He still wants to come in. You are working on your project, you tell him no. Now he insists and uses his key. What the fuck?  Now you feel the danger. This guy could do anything to you. He forced his way in!(i know it's a key, but he does not have your permission.)

But either way, you agreed to house her for the duration of her program, if she's still willing to live there you should continue. She hasn't done anything truly terrible that would break that guideline. \n\nBeyond that, talk about what she's comfortable with in terms of if it'd be ideal to have your brother discontinue open access while she is a resident. She's not just a guest if she's full-time living there for a couple months. She's a guest in terms of \"don't paint the walls\" but not in terms of \"not having the right to refuse a guest when she's the only one home\". Maybe call it \"temporary resident\" to allow her resident rights, but not long-term type changes of moving furniture and painting walls, etc. \n\nYou knew this was an intensive program. Probably should have expected she'd need some peace and quiet more than you're used to. Talk it through. Could she spend certain times at the library when you want brother gaming or loud music time?

I mean, you can see how toxic it is to try and make your girlfriend/boyfriend side against their family right? There is no mention of the twin being rude to her or creepy, so it isn't right to make that assumption. Just because she is dating him doesn't give her claim to his apartment, a guest is a guest. I'm not saying kicking her out was a good choice, it isn't. It is unfair and rude to her, but she can't demand he kick his own brother out.

It\u2019s possible she could lose her job", "The short and simple of it was his wife is doing her residency, comes home and talks about her patients in detail. Husband doesn't like listening to it and wife is essentially breaking HIPPA by telling him, but a lot of medical professionals do that with their spouses. He talks to wife's coworker in the hopes that coworker will tell wife she needs to stop telling him about her patients.

I, as a patient, wouldn't want any of my medical details be a free for all for my doctor's family", "It was way more nuance then that. Guy has a wife who is a resident and often shares cases she had during the day. The amount she shared was arguably a HIPPA violation and he told her stop telling him.

He had asked her to stop numerous times because the level of detail she was providing was making him uncomfortable but she refused to, so he spoke with someone else in her programme to ask them to explain to her how not okay her behaviour was and they ended up reporting her.\n\nAs someone who worked in healthcare for years, I personally felt that the wife was totally in the wrong, patient privacy is of the utmost importance and if someone had been caught out doing what she was where I worked they would have been fired instantly.", "The wife in question told him details of a patient *he knew* such that he was able to identify who this person was from her story.\n\nHe talked to a coworker who is her friend because he thought that the friend might be able to talk some sense into the wife, but instead the coworker reported her.", "Idk maybe the girl just wants some PRIVACY with her bf?
