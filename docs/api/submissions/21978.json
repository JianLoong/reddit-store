We can call my brother Matthew for anonymity's sake. To get ahead of some of the most commonly asked questions - We're identical. We do things in sync sometimes, but I don't know if it's any more common than two people who just spend a lot of time together and adopt each other's mannerisms. I would absolutely say that the twin intuition thing is real. We have two older brothers and I love them, but I'm not as close to them as I am Matthew. We have never been away from each other for longer than maybe three days. We don't technically live together but we stay in the same apartment building for college and often just fall asleep at each other's places.\r  \n\r  \nMy girlfriend (24F) and I have been long distance for basically our entire relationship. I'm busy with school and the music me and Matthew work on together, she lives about two hours away and is busy with her job and her grad program. To make a long, somewhat confusing explanation short, she's staying with me for the summer, working shorter hours remotely while she fulfills an in person grad school requirement at the university I currently attend. Most of her grad program has been online, this section is not.\r  \n\r  \nIt's her capstone project and doing it during the summer basically means she's doing it in double time so she really has to buckle down and work. I get that. Still, the way she's been treating my brother isn't cool with me. She often rolls her eyes and shuts herself in our guest bedroom when she comes home and sees that he's over. We smoke together and fuck around on guitars together while we work on music, things she used to be fond of but now seems to hate. \r  \n\r  \nThe final straw came last week when I got a phone call while I was out of her freaking out. She had refused to let my brother in the apartment so he used the key I had given him, and she lost it. She said her boundaries weren't being respected and that I needed to kick him out. Instead, I told her she needs to leave.\r  \n\r  \nShe's furious, saying she can't find somewhere else to stay on such short notice and I'm fucking up the most important class of her life, saying I'm too codependent on my brother, and that I should have never told her she could stay when I knew she needed to work and I wasn't allowing her to do so.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r  \n\r", "created_utc": 1689114572, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x5q59/aita_for_kicking_my_girlfriend_out_in_the_middle/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The two of you are spending your time dicking around and she's trying to work.  Then someone who doesn't live there used a key to get into the apartment when he clearly wasn't wanted?  Nope.\n\nRelationship's over.", "YTA and so is your brother. He has no business being over at your place with her when you're not there.\n\nGrad school is very stressful, it's only for one term, she needs study time, and all the smoking and rocking out has to be distracting at best: why can't that happen at Bro's apartment since you live in the same building? \n\nDumping someone in the middle of a term, especially one this important, and making them homeless in the process, is like sending a Dear John letter to a soldier deployed in a war zone. You can't come back from this.", "INFO: were any conversations about this had... before the both of you escalated to this event? Or even discussing visiting times or noise levels to allow her to do work? Or from her side about how your brother might be violating her personal space. \n\nI am leaning on E S H. But that middle bit before things went nuts, is kinda important.", "Info - why don\u2019t you guys live together? You\u2019re already together almost every single day anyways.\n\nWas she aware of how often he was there? Why was he there when you weren\u2019t?\n\nI mean, staying with your partner for a summer and then them having a guest over for more than 50% of the time can be irritating.", "YTA - You made a commitment to your girlfriend to live with you for the summer. It\u2019s mid-July so I assume only 6-7 more weeks.  Suck it up!  Go stay at your brother\u2019s place & let your girlfriend finish her class.", "YTA \n\nIf he lives so close, why does he need to be there, especially when you are not there? Why can't you two go to his apartment?", "When you offer someone a space, there's a basic idea at you'll allow them to feel safe.

She\u2019s obviously not comfortable around him and he completely overstepped. You allowed it.\n\nApologise to her. Yes, the relationship might be over but be the decent person and let her complete the term.", "INFO: Do you allow your brother in your home when you're not there?", "YTA double. You knew she was doing something incredibly important and you didn't give a care to her at all. Even if he wasn't a twin he has NO business coming into your place, that you now share, without you there. Nothing wrong with a sibling bond, until it becomes creepy. Also, when you agreed to share it became *her* place too.", "YTA\n\ncan you go hang out in your bothers apt while she is working? it sounds like you keep interrupting her work time", "Info: Why don't your gf and brother get along?", "YTA, it's fine if you want to see your brother every 3 days, but I imagine it is getting on her nerves that he's constantly over. \n\nWhy is he forcing his way into the apartment when you aren't there? It's her home too, at least temporarily, so that's a major overstep on his part.\n\nYou both need to go hang out at HIS place for a few weeks. Would it kill you to be a little considerate?", "Info: Do you actually care about this girl and her feelings or is your brother the only one you're concerned about?", "YTA\n\nIs there something about your twin that you don't know? Something feels off.  Why did your brother need to go into your place while you were away? Did he need to get something important? If not, then why was he randomly going in your apartment while your gf was studying. \n\nWhy doesn't your gf like your brother? Since you say you two are alike in some ways, she should get along with your brother too but she doesn't so there is a reason. Is your brother purposely trying to distract her while she's studying? You may have to dig deeper into this because something is definitely off.\n\nUnless your brother is oblivious as you, that still means two distractions during her study time. Either way, you nor your brother respected your gf's schedule.", "Your girlfriend is a bad communicator, but it also sounds like she may have asked for some grace and privacy and you basically steamrollered over her.  Her mistake was that she didn't realized you were married to your twin, and no consideration would be made for her, the 3rd wheel.  \n\nNext time you have a girlfriend, you should probably be more explicit about your expectations and the pecking order here.\n\nYTA.", "YTA enjoy the sausage party with your bro", "YTA. And not ready for an adult relationship.  Have you even really listened to what your she said (last paragraph)?\n\nBet your brother is happy now though. He's got rid of the main distraction (your girlfriend), and has his little playmate all to himself again", "YTA. Maybe she didn\u2019t mind so much about the hanging out before because she wasn\u2019t living there. And maybe you should have discussed what living together, even temporarily, would be like. But ultimately to kick her out with no notice, no discussion is an AH move. You supposedly care(d) about this person but then just make her leave? Clearly you don\u2019t belong together but at minimum she needs to be given time to make other arrangements.", "YTA. Your brother lives in the same apartment building as you do. So why do you have him come to yours to play guitar while your girlfriend is staying at your place specifically because she has work to do? \n\nWhy would you not go and jam at his appartment? It\u2019s not like he lives far away.", "ESH / YTA. \n\nFirst off it seems kind of immature of her with the eye rolling etc and maybe she should be more accommodating. I'm sure a hard conversation or 2 could have sorted this out before it all came to this. \n\nBut anyway, it doesn't seem like you have considered her point of view. She works hard, and wants to come home and relax in your's and her space but isn't able to some or most of the time (depends how much Matthew is visiting). But finally, he shouldn't have a key if he doesn't live there, or at least if he does, he shouldn't use it to enter against anyone's wishes. \n\nUltimately, I think your problem is that the long-term relationship suited you, because it meant you could kind of have the best of both worlds - a relationship, but also lots of time to spend with your brother. But now she moved in you are trying to maintain the same contact with your brother, which is probably not realistic (as it seems you spend a lot of time together) - you need to dedicate time to your significant other over your brother.", "Yta you have issues you need to deal with poor girl", "YTA", "Wow, YTA. And she's your ex-gf now, lol.", "YTA, he has no buisness forcing his way in when she's staying there and tried to set boundaries.\n\nYou're a pair of assholes", "YTA i am baffled by the fact that you knew how hard she\u2019s been working and you don\u2019t just spend time in his apartment?", "YTA Now that you kicked your GF out, you and your brother can go back to sucking each others dicks.", "YTA??!! Go down the fucking hall to your bros spot so you can jam out and smoke to your hearts content.", "INFO\u2014 are you gay with your brother? I mean you can\u2019t live without him for 24/7\u2026. Even if in bathroom. \n\nC\u2019mon. You\u2019re too old. Time for let him living his life alone. He\u2019s single. He needs to find a girl.

If she doesn't like the accommodations, she should spend less time rolling her eyes and being a dick, and more time trying to find something that works for her. I don't care how important her shit is, it doesn't give her the right to be a childish dick to anyone. Trade up homie, to someone who is down with you and your family.", "INFO- Is she paying rent?\nIf her name isn\u2019t on the lease or paying rent then she has NO say in who comes over. I keep reading comments that she is more important than the relationship you have with your brother. I come from a close family and hanging out like that is normal.
