We can call my brother Matthew for anonymity's sake. To get ahead of some of the most commonly asked questions - We're identical. We do things in sync sometimes, but I don't know if it's any more common than two people who just spend a lot of time together and adopt each other's mannerisms. I would absolutely say that the twin intuition thing is real. We have two older brothers and I love them, but I'm not as close to them as I am Matthew. We have never been away from each other for longer than maybe three days. We don't technically live together but we stay in the same apartment building for college and often just fall asleep at each other's places.\r  \n\r  \nMy girlfriend (24F) and I have been long distance for basically our entire relationship. I'm busy with school and the music me and Matthew work on together, she lives about two hours away and is busy with her job and her grad program. To make a long, somewhat confusing explanation short, she's staying with me for the summer, working shorter hours remotely while she fulfills an in person grad school requirement at the university I currently attend. Most of her grad program has been online, this section is not.\r  \n\r  \nIt's her capstone project and doing it during the summer basically means she's doing it in double time so she really has to buckle down and work. I get that. Still, the way she's been treating my brother isn't cool with me. She often rolls her eyes and shuts herself in our guest bedroom when she comes home and sees that he's over. We smoke together and fuck around on guitars together while we work on music, things she used to be fond of but now seems to hate. \r  \n\r  \nThe final straw came last week when I got a phone call while I was out of her freaking out. She had refused to let my brother in the apartment so he used the key I had given him, and she lost it. She said her boundaries weren't being respected and that I needed to kick him out. Instead, I told her she needs to leave.\r  \n\r  \nShe's furious, saying she can't find somewhere else to stay on such short notice and I'm fucking up the most important class of her life, saying I'm too codependent on my brother, and that I should have never told her she could stay when I knew she needed to work and I wasn't allowing her to do so.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r  \n\r", "created_utc": 1689114572, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x5q59/aita_for_kicking_my_girlfriend_out_in_the_middle/", "score": 8160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The very least you could do is let her stay with you for the rest of her program and have some respect for her.

If this was a woman you could see a future with, you should be treating her as your partner and family. When a man marries a woman, that\u2019s his family. You need to protect your relationship.

OP could be liable for damages due to an illegal eviction and should tread carefully.", "Exactly! This summer, the apartment is her home too. Nobody gets to come in without her permission, especially when she\u2019s home alone! It shouldn\u2019t be hard to get. The brother (and OP) needs to learn some healthy boundaries.", "Write YTA so the bot catches it - you have yth\n\nThe twombs must be on here trying to swing the vote - way too many.

Yeah that thread was wild.", "People need space. This codependency would make me nuts.", "Exactly this - Asserting your dominance over a space is also asserting your dominance over anything - And anyone - in that space.
