I would bet that after 2 or 3 snaps it becomes a game for him to move his wrist and laughingly apologize for doing it again.

I would be willing to bet that he does this to men, too, likely because he thinks he's the smartest person in the room, regardless of topic. \n\nYour partner's assertion that he has to prove he knows something doesn't sound like typical mansplainer behavior. A mansplainer is confident, falsely, that he knows more than the women present, even if it's their field of expertise. I think instead that his behavior is a trauma response to growing up with his father.\n\nImagine being in elementary school and coming home with some tidbit of knowledge that you learned in school, like that magnets have two poles and attract another magnet's opposite pole. This is common knowledge to adults, but it's new and fascinating to children. A child who comes home with that knowledge should be celebrated for their interest in the world around them, but instead, his father likely started explaining how everybody already knew that, taking away the joy of his son's discovery, and also re-explaining it to him as if he didn't know it in the first place.\n\nSo now, when you said provide some information to your partner, he repeats it back to you, because this is the behavior that was modeled to him by his father.\n\nThe good news is, since, unlike mansplaning, this isn't based on a lack of respect for you, he will probably be able to learn to stop doing it with some therapy about his childhood and how he was treated without any respect.", "Just want to mention I looked through all the posts.

I\u2019ve seen some genuinely decent guys fall into that trap sometimes without meaning anything inappropriate, they just don\u2019t know how to handle women\u2019s typical communication styles well and mansplaining happens when they over compensate for their differences. I remember an extensive section on those communication differences and pitfalls from a gender studies textbook. I\u2019m a political scientist and this was a gender and politics course 20 years ago, and it covered how those typical differences can sometimes lead to people making missteps in trying to bridge those communication gaps. Women are more likely to work well in collaboration and I\u2019ve seen men trying to embrace that approach when it\u2019s unnatural for them fall into just word vomiting their knowledge (aka mansplaining).

My high school teachers had similar responses to the unique spelling and pronunciation.", "Because it\u2019s a specific, gendered experience. Why are you so offended acknowledging this is a thing?", "Oh I already know that my last name is misspelled, my great grandparents were illiterate and also came here to Argentina from Ucraine without speaking a singular word of Spanish, but this stranger just rudely told me that my name is \"wrong\". Well, it's the name I was registered with", "Yes, the energy feels really different. Infodumping feels enthusiastic. Mansplaining feels being looked down on.", "Imagine explaining this to the person who invented the light bulb.\n\nThat would be mansplaining.  What you've shared above isn't information I had previously and is kinda interesting.", "People get defensive because certain behaviors are so closely associated with one\u2019s identity that even if both parties acknowledge that the behavior is wrong, the individual in the wrong still can lash out for their partners lack of understanding and appreciation for all the effort they put in to improve and also feel inadequate as a partner for not being good enough. It doesn\u2019t mean OP\u2019s partner doesn\u2019t hold the best intentions for her when he fails to act appropriately 100% of the time. It is just difficult to face your demons, dismantle your ego and belief systems, especially in moment like these where that behavior is still being encouraged by family. Maybe, OPs partner reacts poorly to be called out because he hates the idea of hurting his partner yet finds it difficult to ditch this behavior entirely which puts him in a tough spot emotionally. Which is why tolerance is important. People lack tolerance and they are always in \u201cmy feelings, my ego\u201d mindset without considering that life doesn\u2019t revolve around them and their partner is struggling too. OP\u2019s partner sounds like a decent guy for trying, even when he fails at times.", "OP has made it clear that they know she knows a certain topic, but pulled a gotcha. Her husband knows it too, but insists on explaining anyway. This is not an example of teaching.", "Reddit moment", "When they say you're rude, just ask if they know what that means...", "Basically, they have. OP should say, \u201cok guys, you obviously know a lot about what is and isn\u2019t rude. Can you explain it to me? You\u2019re so good at explaining things to little old me.\u201d", "Because of the gendered nature.", "Once my hubs tried to mansplain that he wasn't mansplaining something. Honestly, all I could do was laugh. Luckily his brain kicked in, he heard himself, and we laughed about it all day. It was a day full of stupid explanations, the more outlandish the better.", "Neither of those seem rude to me. You might\u2019ve come off as less than polite but your intentions seemed fine. You weren\u2019t going out of your way to embarrass them.", "So it's just condescending?", "Nope. Because the same men who just naturally assume all women are less competent than they are don\u2019t make that assumption about other men. They don\u2019t speak to grown men like they are idiots.", "Unless he\u2019s with his dad, apparently. How quickly he forgot to not be an AH.", "You realize how many false positives you probably get right?", "I\u2019m a female attorney. So, no, not \u201cfalse positives\u201d. I\u2019m automatically assumed to be support staff, and men with lesser credentials regularly assume they know more than me.\n\nYou\u2019re pushing hard against mansplaining even when multiple women have shared their experience.", "It is not the tone. Women don't want to be taught stuff all the time. Save it for your kids or your students.\n\nMy husband is the best husband in many dimensions but he can't help himself... I have actually told him several times \" yes, we actually went to the same college and studied the same career, remember?\" And he will still go on to explain stupid shit!", "your comment is such a fucking reddit moment. ugh", "nothing in OP's post even implies that lol", "I agree that it\u2019s not a \u201cdivorce immediately\u201d problem, but it would definitely be a deal breaker for me. I can put up with some weird habits but mansplaining is just a super annoying pet peeve personally. It happens enough at work, I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with it at home. \nSounds like it\u2019s not a deal breaker for OP though.", "People on Reddit love to do this though. You can tell who\u2019s not in a relationship", "You're already awesome for admitting she's knowledgeable and a valuable resource.  That goes a long way in avoiding the mansplain.", "I love the phrase upsetti spaghetti and I will now use it forever and always.", "No anthropologist worth their salt would analyze differing communication styles without taking into account the power differentials. I've also studied this stuff, extensively, in a linguistics degree, and the gender/power factor is definitely at play and varies according to gender/power beliefs rather than being some immutable man vs woman Eternal Difference. \n\nTl;dr: they're still being sexist gits, explained with university words.", "omg, work?? 8 hours a day? I hope you're fine, lmao.\n\nI dated a guy for a short time in uni. we were just getting to know each other, but we were majoring in the same field and we'd often go out after classes. guess what he would always mansplain to me? the exact class that I had also attended that day. lmao.", "I had an ex that loved to start arguments over things he knew nothing about with me. One time, he tried to tell me that cows are not mammals and that their udders are not mammaries. We spent about 20 minutes going back and forth. He got so angry he started crying when I pulled out my phone and showed him what Google said. This was the same day he told me he would never use almond milk when baking something because it would bastardize the recipe... when he knew my daughter and I couldn't have dairy, and I had asked if he could make a recipe he was bragging about for us. He later told me I didn't know the words to my favorite song, and that my idea of the lyrics was ridiculous and made no sense. Two years after we broke up, I bought the album it's from on vinyl. The lyrics were printed on the sleeve. I was right about every single word. I had to fight the urge to send him a picture of it. \n\nHe had an ego the size of Alaska and a brain the size of a pea. I feel bad for his mom, whom he has been living with since we broke up 4 years ago. That Masters of Fine Arts he earned by spending 6 years of his life literally playing around with his friends keeps his massive but fragile ego afloat somehow, despite the fact he doesn't even understand basic elementary school things like what a mammal is...", "Yeah but even if he likes teaching OP doesn\u2019t seem to enjoy being a student. If he wants to teach he should become a teacher. OP wants a partner not a tutor.", "He sounds absolutely insufferable. Glad to hear that he's an ex!", "This is actually great advice. Way better than the alternative reddit advice equivalent of \u201cdivorce immediately\u201d. Which if it\u2019s really insufferable can still be in the table.", ">lots of people are bad at estimating other people's knowledge levels.\n\nMore people are bad at estimating their own knowledge levels. (aka the Dunning-Kruger effect.)", "Yes and somehow they\u2019re expecting OP to lie when directly asked, she would\u2019ve been accused as rude if she hadnt acted interested in the conversation or said \u201cI know\u201d to everything.", "You were mansplaining to me just then. I\u2019ve brought this up before, but you don\u2019t seem to understand. Do you need me to explain it to you again? Then talk them through it like you\u2019re trying to teach a five year old how to perform brain surgery.", "It's ironic, because you accusing me of gaslighting is actual gaslighting.\n\nOp said \"Because apart from the mansplaining issue he's a great person. And like I mentioned, he's working on the mansplaining too, which's been going quite well. It just seems harder not to do when he's together with his dad, I guess it's easier to forget yourself when you're with somebody who approves your ways- it seems like they both encourage each other. \"\n\nThis is not a description of toxic behavior. At most it is a description of someone who fucked up and tries to get better.", "Projection is a big part of protecting one\u2019s ego for these types so they can keep being shitty without self reflecting", "Nope. He jumped right to the toxic behabior when Daddy was there to back him up.", "Here is the toxicity in full flame:\n\nPartner: \"I thought you said you knew it\"- said in a \"gotcha!\" sort of way", "I\u2019d say he\u2019s trying to one up his dad and it wasn\u2019t even at OP. Seems it\u2019s learned behavior and it seems dad would always make him feel he didn\u2019t know anything. By his own words \u201ci feel I need to prove I know things\u201d not \u201ci know more\u201d", "The word is useful to describe a specific type of condescension, so I don't really understand the issue you have. I think people started using it to describe men with lesser credentials talking down to women who are experts in their field. I think the best example was this old famous tweet from a scientist, whose less experienced male colleague told her she needed to read a book on the subject of discussion...that was literally written by her (it was \"you need to read [last name] et al\"). I mean, \"mansplain\" seems like an apt word for that to me. \n\nPeople feel the need to gender it because it's gendered behavior. Being generally condescending is not, but this is a very specific pattern of condescension. The use of the word \"mansplain\" does not attack you, personally, as a man, so I don't know what your problem is.
