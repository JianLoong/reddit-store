I would bet that after 2 or 3 snaps it becomes a game for him to move his wrist and laughingly apologize for doing it again. The rubber band thing was a popular way to remind yourself not to do a habit you were trying to break and seeing it on your wrist typically also provides a reminder to not go there.
