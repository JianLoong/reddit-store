She shouldn't be making the \"skinny\" comments at all, that's a dick move, but you also should have expressed your discomfort and set a boundary that they need to stop rather than \"laughing it off\" since it's clear they actually bothered you a lot. Turning around and calling her overweight isn't the solution here.", "This is a tricky one, but I'm going with NTA. I think your friend is correct, in that the world at large does view larger bodies as more unattractive and thinner bodies as more attractive, so from her point of view, what she said was acceptable and what you said was insulting. But the reality is, no one likes to feel like their body - whether bigger or smaller - is being noticed in a negative way and that is exactly what she was doing, repeatedly. And the way you describe it, she wasn't saying it out of concern for your health or as an objective observation. She was saying it to make you feel badly and to point out how *your* body made *her* body look to others. \n\nI think I would have tolerated it and laughed it off, while being annoyed inside. My whole family has always made similar comments about my body, sometimes with concern and sometimes just \"you need a sandwich, lol\" kind of comments. It's uncomfortable, but I have gotten used to it. But I also think it's reasonable if you reached your limit and made the decision to turn it around on her. This wasn't a subject you brought into the friendship and probably never would have if she didn't keep pressing it. It's one thing to acknowledge different bodies exist. It's even reasonable to feel insecure about your own body in comparison to someone else's. But it seems like her intention was to make you feel badly about your body in order to feel better about herself and that is not something you should have to tolerate endlessly. I hope you can make amends and your friend can find  confidence in herself so that she doesn't resort to insulting you.", "ESH\n\nNeither of you have the right to make the other feel bad about their body.

Stop body shaming each other. I get that she pushed you OP, but hurting someone back will never produce the desired result.

You need to speak up if you don\u2019t like something and in your mind feel like a line is being crossed but you never set that boundary out loud. How can you then lash out to your friend for crossing the boundary you\u2019ve never communicated? We teach people how they can treat us. It\u2019s important to communicate honestly instead of laughing it off. \n\nIf OP had communicated at the first comment or maybe first 2-3 comments on her weight that she didn\u2019t like the comments and they were annoying/hurtful, her friend might\u2019ve backed off.

What a terrible friend to show up when OP was sick and harass her for not doing what THEY wanted her to do (eat more food). They weren\u2019t supporting her, they weren\u2019t helping the situation at all by coming to her home and making her feel worse. \n\nIt is not the responsibility of OP, or anyone, to explain common courtesy to a bully.

Off the top of my head I can think of several real life instances of people lashing out at someone who triggers some insecurity in themselves. Fat people are not excluded from this. Seems like a pretty common experience.", "Yes, it works two ways and that doesn\u2019t stop because one of them isn\u2019t doing it (right). A lot of trouble in friendships and other relationships is because \u201cwell they treated me like X so I\u2019m just also going to do that\u201d in stead off doing your part of the communication. Yes the other one should\u2019ve done their part but they didn\u2019t so you can accept that and move on, you can address that or you can leave the situation. But responding in the same way isn\u2019t actually going to help the situation. You\u2019re just adding unhealthy communication and hurtful comments on top. Just because someone neglected to take responsibility, doesn\u2019t diminish yours. However unfair that is. \n\nAnd I can also come with an \u201cIF\u201d situation, since you want to play that game. What if the friend has had an eating disorder (incredibly hard to break out off) and having OP (a really skinny girl) as a friend triggered her really bad, causing her to reach her breaking point and out of all that hurt and trauma she made those comments to OP. And OP saying \u201cyou eat too much\u201d and saying she\u2019s overweight confirmed her deeply rooted fears. What then?\n\nThere\u2019s no excuse for the friend to make the comments. But same goes for OP. Two wrongs aren\u2019t going to make anything right.", "Then she need to go to therapy for her \u201ctriggers\u201d. Oh, and if body shaming is a trigger for this girl, she shouldn\u2019t be doing it to OP! \n\nIf she can\u2019t handle friends who aren\u2019t her body type, more therapy. And maybe be honest with themselves and not abuse someone else because they don\u2019t have their shit together.", "Yes she should take responsibility indeed, the same goes for OP. That\u2019s my point. You\u2019re responsible of communicating how you feel. Letting things that clearly annoy you/hurt you build up is not healthy and not fair either.
