To give some context, I\u2019ve been in this friend group since high school around 2018-2019 and have been friends with two of them since freshman year. Throughout the years I\u2019ve been with them, they\u2019ve noticed a lot of little toxic traits I\u2019ve had, and didn\u2019t really tell me a lot of them. So around the end of March, beginning of April they started avoiding me and just telling me that they\u2019re too busy to hang out. For two weeks things was dead silent with me and them. I actually thought they were just to busy to hang out, but they were actually planning to talk to me about my problems with an intervention. \n\nAfter the two weeks, they shoot me a text saying to meet at this Starbucks with the specific address of it and at 4. So I asked if we weren\u2019t friends, cause they were avoiding me and they only replied with, \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d So I did, and all of them were sitting at a table in the middle of the Starbucks waiting for me. Once I sat down they started to list out the problems they\u2019ve had with me, like not being open enough with my feelings, having double standards with touching things, or zoning out when I\u2019m not in the conversations and not to join them. I\u2019m not going to lie, I did feel uncomfortable talking about issues about me in public. I didn\u2019t realize these problems but after them saying it, I really feel like a jerk once seeing it. Now here\u2019s where I feel like I would be the asshole in the situation and further. Midway through them talking, I just straight up left because I felt hurt and didn\u2019t want to continue that conversation. \n\nRight now I\u2019m slowly trying to fix the issue one at a time so new people I meet won\u2019t deal with it. Another two weeks go by, and I felt terrible about how I was to them in general. One friend that knew the group and my situation, that friend told me that the friend group is still willing to be friends. After feeling bad about myself, I tried to text one of the friends to setup a talk. I asked if it was fine to meet up and talk at his or my place. He replied by saying he would rather talk at Starbucks or coffee place, and I tried to compromise with a park not to far from our places. He didn\u2019t like the compromise, saying that he didn\u2019t feel safe or comfortable to talk to me unless it\u2019s somewhere he like and that wasn\u2019t for negotiation. For me I told him I didn\u2019t feel comfortable to talk in a public space like a coffee shop, and I wouldn\u2019t like to be in the same situation as before. Then it got a little emotional for me that I won\u2019t go into or repeat. \n\nI did still wanted to be friends with one other person in the group. So I tried to message them and he responded with basically saying that, \u201cIf you want to apologize, you have to say sorry to everyone in the group. You ended our friendship the moment as soon as you left the Starbucks.\u201d So far that\u2019s where my story with my ex-friends is at. \n\nAm I the asshole for being the start and end of my situation?\n\n\nEdit 1: When I said touching stuff, meant in more of grabbing a book off the shelf, borrowing a hammer, and etc without permission.\n\nEdit 2: One of the bigger reasons why I posted here was because I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m \u201cunsafe\u201d to them.

An intervention would be if you were doing something (ex. Drugs) and the people care about you and want you to get better. What they did was gossip behind your back, isolate you, and gang up on you in a place where you were uncomfortable.

Kind of odd, are they scared of your reaction? They probably should've done it on a call to ease the awkwardness/tension of sitting in person, and maybe you wouldn't have felt so confronted and left. However, you know you have toxic traits, have your friends tried to bring up issues with your behaviour in the past, and you brushed it off/ignored them? Because interventions usually don't pop out of nowhere, could be the whole group doesn't like you anymore and decided you're getting kicked out, or they're sick of waiting and telling you to change and you're negatively affecting them all. They probably shouldn't have started out blasting all your flaws. Maybe they were about to get to the point of telling you how they want you to improve. I feel like you know what you've done already and don't want to be labelled as the bad guy.\n\nI may have some bias because I've had a similar situation where a friend wouldn't change, then when an intervention happened, they were shocked and didn't understand, thought we were ganging up on them etc.", "ESH\n\nDon't have interventions *in public places*, and especially not restaurants.\n\nStarbucks is for **drinking coffee**, full stop.", "NTA for walking out of a public trap.

That said, your friends could probably learn a bit more about giving feedback. This shouldn't be done in a public place. It can also be very difficult for the person receiving feedback if there are many people providing negative feedback at the same time as it creates quite the imbalance of power, and the person receiving feedback would have a hard time explaining themselves. Also, unless you are actually a safety risk, I think it would have been more reasonable if your friend compromised and picked a place you were both comfortable with. All in all, probably an ESH situation. You can try to explain to them how the entire situation made you uncomfortable because it was in a public place, and that you were overwhelmed, hence leaving the cafe, but that you still want to try to fix your errors.

So NTA for getting the heck out of there!!!\n\nThat said, it sounds like you could use some help with social skills.  If your college has a counseling center, I wonder if there are licensed therapist-lead (as opposed to peer group bully-lead) social skills groups that you could join?

This is a whole mindset now. \n\n My advice is to tell your friends that if they have an issue with you,act like a FRIEND and just lay it on you. In return,you will NOT flip out or get stupid about it. No ganging up,no belittling and no bullshit. That\u2019s how real friends are supposed to do it.", "NTA.

Kinda hard to feel accepted as a friend after being treated like an underperforming employee. \n\nIt\u2019s healthy to think about ways that you may be failing as a friend/human, but you should also make sure to always surround yourself with people who treat you with respect and kindness. None of the alleged flaws that they pointed out are things you should feel obliged to change. \n\n1.) you don\u2019t have to share your feelings with them if you don\u2019t want to. They should consider exploring why you aren\u2019t comfortable confiding in them.\n\n2.) you don\u2019t have to allow them to touch you, even if they allow you to touch them. That\u2019s not a \u201cdouble standard\u201d everyone gets to set their own personal boundaries for physical touch\u2014and just because you are sometimes ok with physical contact does not mean you have to be okay with it all the time. \n\n3.) you do not need to always be reacting/engaging in their conversations in the exact way they choose.

The thing s you describe don't seem very serious but if they feel your being hypocritical I can see how it could become an issue. \n\nI don't think there enough context to make a fair judgement here. Your not TA for leaving but remember this may have been a geniune(if poorly thought out) attempt to repair an isuue. \n\nIt was harsh of you friend to demand you apologize to everyone but he may have felt the you were attempting to drive wedge between him and the others. \n\nIf you still want to the friend.

Unless they're just straight up attacking you, I think you need to ask for a voice chat call instead, and tell them you're willing to listen and attempt to change whatever they've got issues with. I know it seems scary and confronting, but if they want you to do better and keep being friends, they wouldn't have intervened.", "I think you meant to reply to OP.", "That\u2019s it??? The way this went down, I was expecting to hear that you stole their IDs and took out credit cards in their names or that you\u2019re a violent drinker or that you purposely steal boyfriends/girlfriends.\n\nInterventions are for people who are a danger to themselves and others and whose life is in peril\u2014not because they\u2019re guilty of a couple of annoyances.\n\nGeez. I stand by my previous statement. These people are the ones with the toxic behaviors.", "Hey Opie, seriously look into that neurodivergence, I'm getting big \"ND kid getting bullied by their friends\" vibes", "What\u2019s the \u201ctouching\u201d thing about in the OP?", "Honestly, Idk if it was something so serious that they would feel that way. They never really said anything I did super serious that can harm them physically or mentally. They really just listed off several things that I need to be better at and try fix them.", "Agree. Either something is being left out of the story or his friends have some serious growing up to do", "Oh 100% when people say it's about the quality of friends over the quantity. \n\nSo much childish behavior happened during college and I'll admit I was part of it. I may not have spoken at those \"interventions\" but I was still there or didn't call out the others. What happened to me was my just desserts and opened my eyes about it. It's just plain old bullying by public humiliation.", "Have you ever been threatening or violent? The safety thing seems out of place. \n\nSo far even though you admit you need to grow as a person you don't  sound out of line \nNTA", "I did sorry", "I'm sorry but I'm just giggling on how wild of a person you thought I am. I know I can be shit, but I'm not going to ruin peoples lives", "Like just grabbing a book off the shelf, borrowing a hammer, opening a freezer, doing things like that without asking", "And they absolutely *had* to do this in public? And they're not completely comfortable being alone with you?", "It's already a long post but I feel like we're missing something.", "Sorry, are you trying to talk to op? You're replying to me.", "Well, for people to stage an intervention and to claim they don\u2019t trust meeting you in a park, I was expecting you to have done something really serious, maybe even criminal\u2026\n\nBut this is over a Christmas present reaction video? COME. ON.\n\nI\u2019m embarrassed for them.", "Yeah you need new friends, you're being set up to be the groups whipping boy.", "Might want to edit your post with this detail. I immediately assumed the \"touching\" was sexual or something. You were really vague about it and usually when people are vague like that it's because they did something really bad and don't want to own up to it.\n\nNTA. NTA x 100. You have very shitty friends. Consider finding some new ones.", "We've had private conversations before about our problems, and I've known some their issues with things and they some of know mine. Idk", "Sorry my oops.", "\ud83d\udc4d", "Honestly I'm sticking to NTA. Don't put people on the spot in public.", "Haha, all good.", ">You ended our friendship the moment as soon as you left the Starbucks.\n\nNo. Friendship ended, and you should quite happily let it end, when they had your intervention in a **public space where they effectively just ridiculed you in front of strangers**. I don't care what social problems you have, those are trivial when compared to this nonsense. \n\nInterventions are private. And interventions are about *your* well being, not \"Hey, we don't like these things about you.\" It's \"Hey, you need to stop doing a thing because it hurts you and we are here to support you.\" What you experienced was neither of those things.", "That wasn't an intervention.\n\nThat was a case of;\n\"So, we've been talking about you and the things we don't like about you, and feel the need, as a group, to tell you each and every single one, in a public setting hoping it would keep you calm\"\n\nInterventions include a consult AT MINIMUM with a professional who deals in these things\n\nIt's not an intervention if done properly.\n\nPersonality traits is a far cry from what they tried to do and I feel sad that at their age, they still don't understand!\nKindness goes a long way.\n\nBeing honest is good, but brutality is not needed.\n\nNTA\n\nMaybe meet some new friends - the whole group sound childish!", "NTA. you need new friends though", "That wasn\u2019t an intervention. They were bullying you because they don\u2019t like you.", "This really feels like a \"three sides to every story\" issue here.\n\nThe big question that remains is why do they not wany to meet with you unless it's in a crowded public place with cameras and witnesses? If you have done something to warrant this, you're probably not worth the effort to reconcile things. If their reason for this requirement is baseless, they're not worth the effort.\n\nSo, not enough info for me to judge.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriends\u201d lacked empathy and critical thinking big time here. What they did was exactly what How I Met Your Mother was making fun of with the intervention running gag, except they were too obtuse to get the joke. \n\n\u201cMagic tricks? Guys, interventions are supposed to help people, not attack every little thing you don't like about them.\u201d", "bro forget them and find new friends. real friends don\u2019t do \u201cinterventions\u201d like that. they should have communicated it better. NTA", "INFO: Can you tell us a bit more about what it is you do that they consider unacceptable? Because zoning out and preferring to keep your feelings to yourself are not \"toxic traits\", and interventions for being a scatterbrain or an introvert are not a thing. This sounds to me like you are being bullied by your friend group, unless the behaviour they object is is *very* egregious (e.g. sexual harassment, extensive trauma-dumping, manipulative threats of self harm - that kind of thing).", "This doesnt soubd like friends hon. Its time to branch out", "An intervention is for a person who has a drug addiction or an alcoholic, maybe a bad parent.  An intervention to point out flaws sounds like bullying.  Also an intervention should never be in a public place.", "I agree. Nothing OP has described as \u201ctoxic traits\u201d are especially bad. Mildly annoying at most, and typical of things that many many people do.\n\nThis public shaming and bullying after weeks of silent treatment is appalling and may have lasting impact on his self-esteem. What shitty people these friends are. My best guess is that there\u2019s one person who wants to drive him out of the group for some unspecified reason that has nothing to do with any of the \u201ctoxic\u201d traits mentioned. I speculate it is related to jealousy of some kind or OP being a rival or competitor in some way but it could be anything.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to find better, kinder friends.", "I did the same as a young teen with my friend group, though we did do it privately and word our problems gently it was, in retrospect, still incredibly shitty because it was a bunch of us airing our issues against one person all alone. It is something you do as a kid because you don't know better about how to communicate and have tough conversations without being an asshole. Like you said, not something 20-somethings should be doing at their big age.", "None of these behaviours are remotely toxic. Yikes.\n\nIf anyone is toxic here, it\u2019s these people who claim to be your friend. The fact that they staged an intervention over these \u201ctraits\u201d is absolutely WILD. You will be infinitely better without their poisonous presence in your life. NTA.", "I think that\u2019s the point of the intervention, that they want to stay friends but don\u2019t feel safe to do so. It\u2019s impossible to say if that\u2019s fair without knowing what they are scared of though, if anything, as op doesn\u2019t seem to know either", "This is such a weird, mobby, and public way to address concerns. Did they all just binge watch some intervention shit on TLC or something?\n\nNTA, my dude.\n\nThey straight up ambushed you for some sort of weird public shaming. Friends don't treat friends like this. So fucking weird.", "OP I was quick to judge but after these comment you are NOT the AH and they certainly are. My ex used to do these things, and he has ADHD and now after many years he's also been diagnosed as Autistic. But I never yelled, never did anything like this and neither have his friends. These people are not your friends and to be honest, it sounds like the groupis toxic and you're the scapegoat. Go find some better friends, these people are Ah's.", "Even if you were not the best friend, such \"intervention\" is worse. I'd say people grow apart, so take your lessons from this experience and move on. NTA", "INFO: I agree with OP that the Starbucks thing sucks. Seems like a private conversation would\u2019ve been better for sure, so I don\u2019t fault OP for that. BUT then these friends are saying they don\u2019t feel \u201csafe or comfortable\u201d with OP alone or out even at a public park? It feels like important information is missing here\u2026\n\n\u201cThen it got a little emotional for me that I won\u2019t go into or repeat.\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m wondering if OP has a tendency to be aggressive? Or at least something just feels like something else is going on here and OP isn\u2019t mentioning it? Not sure if anyone else agrees.", "NTA, these people don't sound like friends at all, their treatment of you is unacceptable. While it is good consider criticism and reflect on your flaws, that just sounds like them bullying you honestly. Sadly we sometimes encounter people too self absorbed/living in their own reality that we start to accept their views and see ourselves from their eyes and that's not healthy. Each of us have our own idiosyncrasies and that's alright. Consider this,  would you treat a friend the same way they treated you?", "This is either a major case of \u201cmissing reasons\u201d or this friend group is THA. It\u2019s really hard to tell from only hearing OPs side of thing. The one red flag I see about believing OPs story whole cloth is that the friend said they feel unsafe with OP. But it\u2019s really hard to tell.", "YTA.", "NTA they sound like assholes tbh.", "Ive had an ex and two friends(a couple) treat me like I was a danger to them all of a sudden, much to my confusion. sometimes the people you think you can trust are just out for themselves and only intend to use you as a stepping stone to whatever they want. I genuinely believe some people do this just to make themselves feel better.", "NTA? \nmaybe you handled it poorly, but I've never heard of an intervention like that before. it's not like you were being a fiend, or needlessly cruel.. \nI'd be annoyed if you borrowed my things without asking,but I'd tell you that and you wouldn't do it again?\nthe whole situation is abit strange,  so I'm not sure.", "People watching too much HIMYM", "Why does OP suck?", "You'd be shocked how toxic people can be. Just bc they claim to fear one on one with op doesn't confirm op is toxic. Could be they know the intervention was bs lowkey and don't want to deal with one on one conversations and would rather stay ganged up on them. Doing it one on one makes the guilt rise whereas they can remain confident bullies in their little group of yes mans. \n\nOr Op could be toxic who knows.\n\nI've experienced the first, so I give op benefit of the doubt. Some people are just toxic highschool level bullies especially in a group", "INFO: Did you film her secretly without her permission?", "Not to be an armchair psychologist, but I was thinking the same.", "I don't think you \"can be shit\", dude, you sound like you're trying and it's hard to be perfect. Yeah, maybe you did some things that bothered them, but this is freakin weird to confront you about it in this way. Interventions are for drugs or alcohol or crime, not for accidentally snubbing someone at a party once or twice. NTA\n\n\nFind better friends, even if it means being alone for a bit, sounds like you've internalized some stuff that's bad for your self esteem"]}
