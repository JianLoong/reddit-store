They all asked my sister what theme she wanted and suggested a theme of everyone wearing their old wedding dresses. In our culture, some people actually show up to the actual wedding in their wedding dresses but I have been pretty vocal about how that is messed up seeing as how I grew up in America where people don't even wear the same color as the bride to respect her.\n\nKnowing this, everyone repeatedly asked my sister if it would be ok for them to wear their wedding dresses on a smaller party before the wedding instead. She said she had no problem and that it was such a cute tradition. I got my sister alone after this conversation and asked her if she was sure. She promised me she was and said she was excited to see me in my wedding dress again. I told her that I don't want to, seeing as how I was recently married and I don't want to take any attention from her. She responded that she would get offended if I didn't wear my wedding dress because I wouldn't be following the theme and it would look like I wasn't happy for my sister.\nOn the day of the party, i found another dress and called my sister to let her know that I wanted to wear that one if possible because it wouldn't take away from her spotlight and also because l'm pregnant and it would be more comfortable for me to wear. She told me to stop being annoying and to just wear my wedding dress like everyone else. \nSo I wore my wedding dress. At the party, A bunch of my family teared up when they saw me because I had gotten married in America and it was their first time seeing me as a bride.\nAt the party I noticed my sister was reserved and quiet around me but she was complimenting and dancing with everyone else. \n\nAfter everyone left and it was just my grandma and parents, she starting screaming at me and crying. She said that I took away the spotlight and that I shouldn't have worn my wedding dress and that i should accept that she is the bride and not me.  I told her that I only wore it because of her, and she denied it and said that I was just jealous of the attention she was getting. \n\nMy parents are angry with me. My sister posted on her fb that I wore a wedding dress to her wedding and all of our friends in America are appalled and saying that they don't want someone like me in their lives anymore.My parents want me to publicly apologize to her for ruining her special day but my husband said that it's not my fault because I repeatedly asked her before.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690057217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156u6vo/aita_for_wearing_my_wedding_dress_to_my_sisters/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd give her a wide berth.", "NTA I would go as far as to out her on Facebook sharing the wedding and the theme and why you wore your dress. Your parent shouldn\u2019t be mad either since the family wanted this theme. Maybe have some of the family members back you up about the theme. I\u2019m sure there could have been a precaution taken where you brought the other dress. Then you could check with her during the party to see about changing.

Ngl reading this I was automatically on your sisters side however as you explained it became clear that your sister is immatute and unable to accept the consquences of her own actions. She is still young so there is still time for this behaviour to chnage so as her older sister and a person who cares for her welll being you should really set some boundries as it seems your parents never did this. Your parents only care about the image of the family which is not inherantly wrong but they went about it completely wrong.

I would say to trust your gut in the future. It was trying to tell you something you knew could go wrong.

Please pause OP, and consider if this would lead to regrets.  \n\nIt might be better to work with your sister.  Pray for her.  Good prayers, not bad.  Being innocent makes us want to get revenge but not always best.\n\nWhat about showing this thread to her.  I wouldn't threaten her but maybe text her a link to this conversation and as her what you should do.  If you are uncomfortable doing that, why?", "1. Yeah, they were all in their wedding dresses.\n2. My dress and my sisters is similar she really likes mine so had hers made similar \n3. I shipped my dress back to my parents country (where I had it made) because I was hoping to sell it but no one had bought it so it was still there at my grandmas place where we were staying \n\nAnd I knew in advance that it would take attention away because the people there hadn\u2019t seen me in my wedding dress, they weren\u2019t there for the wedding even though they wanted to be. Also, everyone there was significantly older and had older wedding dresses that were outdated. I was the only one who had gotten married within the past decade I think, so my dress was the only \u201cmodern\u201d one so I knew that it would stand out more", "Thanks for the explanations. You are NTA. It seems very strange that your parents are angry with you too about it. A public apology wouldn\u2019t even make sense being that everyone who was there thought it was normal that you were in your wedding dress, alongside so many other ladies.\n\nMaybe you can find a pic of multiple people in wedding dresses to post to show off the traditional aspect of it.\n\nAs far as your sister though, you\u2019ll have to decide whether making her happy in the moment is more significant than being \u201cright\u201d. Sometimes we say whatever helps someone feel better even when it\u2019s stupid and caused by their own insecurities.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister sounds like an entitled, attention-seeking golden child.\n\nI think that - based on the timings - she knew EXACTLY what she was doing and she wanted to ruin your image so that more attention would be paid to her.", "NTA.\nI'm so sorry. Tell your story. Show pictures with everyone in their dresses if you can. Protect yourself.", "NTA. Hopefully at least some of your exchange on the matter was over text. Screencap it and post it in reply to her posts.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister didn't just ask you to do this, she *insisted* on it even though you warned her that it would be a bad idea.

Sounds like a typical case of \u201cLittle-Sister-Being-Jealous-Of-Big-Sister\u201d to me\u2026", "NTA", "You need to tell everybody that it was your sisters idea to have people wear their wedding dresses to the party. You repeatedly asked her if it was okay for you to wear it and she said yes. You were so concerned about her feelings that you found another dress that you could wear to the party and asked her the day of the party if she was sure but she insisted that you wear your wedding dress.\n\nWhat you feared came to pass and your sister was upset by all the attention  that you received as it was some of your relatives first time seeing you as a bride. She is lying to cover her tracks and putting out a false story to cover her jealousy of you. You could apologize for hurting her feelings but since you had repeatedly asked her beforehand if she would bothered by you wearing your dress (and you even offered to wear a different dress the day of the party and she declined the offer) and she said no, you will not be apologizing for wearing your gown.\n\nThere were several other attendees who can vouch for the theme of the party. And if you think that I am the sort of person who would do such a hurtful thing to my sister intentionally, I do not wsnt to remain friends with you. My sister has to own up to her feelings of jealousy. I have done nothing wrong.", "NTA.  Your sister actively encouraged it until she realized that you were getting attention.  Then she got jealous.  Stand up for yourself.", "NTA. But cut all ties with your sister. She\u2019s toxic!", "OP should include screenshots if she has them.", "Are you high? No way. She has to defend herself! And go no contact with the toxic sister!", "So she carried her WD to another country even though she did not know her sister would demand she wear it? That's odd.", "NTA, you are not responsible for other people's reactions.", "You deserve empathy and compassion right now.  I am glad your husband has your back.\n\nYou did everything you you could to be loving, caring, considerate of your sister..  You talked with her, several times. She insisted that you wear the dress.\n\nYou did not want to be the center of attention and you told her so.  \n\nYour sister is not rational.  \n\nIt is very sad.  I could have sympathy for sister for making a mistake except she escalated it with posting on SM and involving your parents.  She went out of her way to harm you.\n\nNTA.\n\n.", "If any of your friends give you any trouble for this just ask them if they knew it was the theme for the party and if they are still mad after then they are just unreasonable and you shouldn\u2019t associate with them.

She told you repeatedly to wear it.", "There\u2019s a hole here. You mentioned wearing the dress to the pre-wedding parties, which your sister was like \u201comg shut up and just wear the dress\u201d to, but your family is mad you \u201cwore it to her wedding.\u201d\n\nDid you wear it on the wedding day, too? Because from what I was reading before it sounds like she and her friends agreed to wedding gowns for the pre-parties, but I don\u2019t think she expected to see them on the wedding day itself.", "NTA- your sister is jealous, it was a party before the wedding, she\u2019ll get over it once she has her big day.", "NTA I would post one of her wedding photos so everyone can see that it was not just you doing it along with some screenshots of messages if possible", "I added this in a comment earlier but I shipped my dress there a few months after my wedding cause I had it made there and I was trying to sell it. It didn\u2019t sell and it was still there at my gmas house where we were staying", "Agreed. OP, you need to defend yourself. Do not lose friends because of your sisters lies.  NTA", "If she loses friends, they weren't real friends.  A true friend doesn't take one person's side without bothering to hear the other person's side of the story.  This has happened to me a couple of times in my life and, to be honest, the loss of those friendships turned out to be a really good thing in the long run - in fact, no loss at all really."]}
