{"id": 25984, "submission_id": "166wh4z", "title": "AITA for asking a girl at the gym to delete her video?", "selftext": "Earlier today, I (22M) was doing a typical workout at my local commercial gym. I was about halfway through. I do not wear headphones while working out and generally stare at either my feet or one of the big digital clocks while doing my reps. I also do not keep my phone on me, I have my workouts kept in a little notebook. At this particular gym I do not have any \u201cgym friends\u201d that I interact with whatsoever. \n\nAnyways, it was busier than usual today, and a girl around my age or younger was there with her friend. They were recording each other doing their respective workouts with what seemed like every set. I thought it was a bit excessive but didn\u2019t care because at the time they were on the opposite side of the weight room. However when I moved over to their side to use the leg extension machines, I became much more aware of where their phones were pointing. I saw a few other people working out who seemed to be aware of this as well.\n\nOn my 3rd set of leg extensions, my eyes were shut with a pain face. You know how it is. When I finished and opened my eyes, one girl was doing lat pulldowns directly opposite to me. Her friend was recording her front side, and I could see I was most definitely in the frame, no more than 10 feet away. This really bothered me since I only want privacy while I\u2019m working out. Is that unreasonable?\n\nSo I stood up, waited till the one girl finished her pulldowns, then calmly said to the girl holding the phone, \u201cexcuse me can you please delete that video. I am in it and I dont want to be in it.\u201d\n\nThey both looked at me like I was from outer space. To be fair I was covered in sweat and probably very red but still. Then the girl who recorded the video tried to tell me I wasnt in it. I said I didn\u2019t believe her because I could very clearly see the camera.\n\nThe girl who was being recorded then said \u201cdon\u2019t be weird dude\u201d At that point I was becoming very agitated, though I did not raise my voice. I just asked again, \u201cplease delete the video I dont want to be on your video.\u201d\n\nThe girl who recorded it then said \u201cfine I will,\u201d made a few taps on her phone (I couldnt see the screen so I have no idea if she deleted it or not). Before walking away I said they shouldn\u2019t record people without their permission especially in a gym. They again shrugged this off and the girl who recorded me said its not a big deal because everyone makes workout videos. Okay. I didnt finsh my workout I just went home.\n\nI checked online, the gym\u2019s policy states no tripods, but it does not explicitly prohibit filming. So what do you think? Both girls seemed to think I was being rude or annoying. I just want to workout in privacy. Am I an Asshole?\n\nEdit: typo.\n\nEdit 2: This did not take place in the US! No 1A rights are applicable.

It's easy to avoid people filming. I do it all the time.\n\nAnd for you personally, yes I do think youre a little insecure about your lifting faces. No on cares. Like, no one. They'd never have given you a second thought in their filming if you'd not mentioned it. Not a single person gives any kind of anything about how squished your lifting face is.

If what they did was against the law, you wouldn't be here asking the question. Nor would you have checked gym policies.\n\nSo if what they did was legal, you're TA. There is no expectation of privacy in a public, shared space.", "nta", "ESH.\n\nThey should have asked if you were ok with it or waited until you cleared the area first, or at least offered to show you the video to see if you were in it or not when confronted.  That said, if there's not a policy or law against it, you've not got any grounds to demand them to not film.  I don't want to be filmed like that either, however if you're in a space with others that can observe you your right to privacy is somewhat out the window, it's not your home and you're there knowing there's other people around.\n\nI'd ask the gym to have a formal policy posted, if they allow it then you should get a new gym if it makes you uncomfortable.", "People are so confused by what they believe a public space is.", "NTA!\n\nThere's a influencer by the name Joey Swoll that made an Instagram account talking about gym etiquette for this same reason.

People recording you is intrusive, whatever their reason for doing it. Some people on here say they record to check their form, which seems reasonable to me, but it's also self-serving and if someone is being recorded by that person doesn't like it, then they have every right to say so. I personally would feel very uncomfortable and self-conscious knowing that I was in the shot when someone was recording, regardless of their reasons. If people insist on recording to check their form, then as benign as that might seem, it's also selfish and intrusive in my opinion. But these two girls seem like they were probably recording for instagram, just given the sheer volume of videos they did.\n\nNTA at all. Keep calling out this nonsense.", "NTA", "NTA at all.\n\nI can't stand people who come to the gym and just video/photo themselves. Luckily I've found a local gym in a former mechanic garage on an industrial estate and it doesn't attract these kinds of people.", "NTA\n\nPeople who do this at the gym drive me insane\n\nYou need to talk to the gym staff about the video. If they allow pics and videos, I would find a new gym.", "Nta", "NTA.\n\nI would of also alerted management that tiktokers were filming other people without consent. \n\nYour gym should not be allowing recording at all if others are in the shot.

He is also a PT in the gym and uses video to advertise on social media.\n\nWhen I'm filming I try and be very careful - I check the mirrors and everything. I know he checks for anything I've missed before posting.\n\nIf someone did complain that I'd filmed them, I think I'd give a half apology (\"I'm sorry if I did, let me check\" ) and then check. If I did catch someone, I'd give a full apology and delete it.\n\nThis makes me think the girls made two mistakes. First, inconsiderate filming and the second being difficult with OP.\n\nNeither is the worst behaviour in the gym, but definitely room for improvement.", "They also have every right to record even if it\u2019s annoying.
