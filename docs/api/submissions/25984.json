{"id": 25984, "submission_id": "166wh4z", "title": "AITA for asking a girl at the gym to delete her video?", "selftext": "Earlier today, I (22M) was doing a typical workout at my local commercial gym. I was about halfway through. I do not wear headphones while working out and generally stare at either my feet or one of the big digital clocks while doing my reps. I also do not keep my phone on me, I have my workouts kept in a little notebook. At this particular gym I do not have any \u201cgym friends\u201d that I interact with whatsoever. \n\nAnyways, it was busier than usual today, and a girl around my age or younger was there with her friend. They were recording each other doing their respective workouts with what seemed like every set. I thought it was a bit excessive but didn\u2019t care because at the time they were on the opposite side of the weight room. However when I moved over to their side to use the leg extension machines, I became much more aware of where their phones were pointing. I saw a few other people working out who seemed to be aware of this as well.\n\nOn my 3rd set of leg extensions, my eyes were shut with a pain face. You know how it is. When I finished and opened my eyes, one girl was doing lat pulldowns directly opposite to me. Her friend was recording her front side, and I could see I was most definitely in the frame, no more than 10 feet away. This really bothered me since I only want privacy while I\u2019m working out. Is that unreasonable?\n\nSo I stood up, waited till the one girl finished her pulldowns, then calmly said to the girl holding the phone, \u201cexcuse me can you please delete that video. I am in it and I dont want to be in it.\u201d\n\nThey both looked at me like I was from outer space. To be fair I was covered in sweat and probably very red but still. Then the girl who recorded the video tried to tell me I wasnt in it. I said I didn\u2019t believe her because I could very clearly see the camera.\n\nThe girl who was being recorded then said \u201cdon\u2019t be weird dude\u201d At that point I was becoming very agitated, though I did not raise my voice. I just asked again, \u201cplease delete the video I dont want to be on your video.\u201d\n\nThe girl who recorded it then said \u201cfine I will,\u201d made a few taps on her phone (I couldnt see the screen so I have no idea if she deleted it or not). Before walking away I said they shouldn\u2019t record people without their permission especially in a gym. They again shrugged this off and the girl who recorded me said its not a big deal because everyone makes workout videos. Okay. I didnt finsh my workout I just went home.\n\nI checked online, the gym\u2019s policy states no tripods, but it does not explicitly prohibit filming. So what do you think? Both girls seemed to think I was being rude or annoying. I just want to workout in privacy. Am I and Asshole?\n\nEdit: typo.", "created_utc": 1693540303, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166wh4z/aita_for_asking_a_girl_at_the_gym_to_delete_her/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You told them that you were uncomfortable with being in the video you stood up for yourself.\n\nThere are reasons to record yourself and it\u2019s mostly to do with checking your form.

I am sure other people felt uncomfortable as well", "NTA", "It sucks but if they don't have rules about it then they can film. It's a public space you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy and I personally ended up on social media once and my sister messaged me like is this you? Sure enough it was me!

If I'm at the gym and I see people recording I just stop and do something else or you could go the opposite and do really weird stuff but then you might go viral lol.", "ESH.  Filming at the gym sucks, more than a few seconds is AH behavior.  Asking them nicely if they are done or if they could try to avoid filming with you in the background woulda been fine.  Demanding they delete a video that\u2019ll never affect you is AH behavior too though.  Nobody watching cares about you in that thirst trap video, take it easy.", "ESH\n\nOne gym video isn\u2019t worth arguing with a clearly uncomfortable stranger. They wouldn\u2019t want to be filmed without their permission either and should have just deleted it and moved on. \n\nOn the other hand I believe they have a right to film and the gym didn\u2019t explicitly state that they couldn\u2019t so demanding the video be deleted is excessive. You also moved to where they were filming fully aware that you could end up in one of their videos.\n\nI notice people filming much more often at the gym now. I don\u2019t particularly like it and feel awkward if I see myself in the background but there is not much that can be done. I tend to just back off from people that are filming.

They had no sense of that. Whether they post the stuff or not is not the point", "Its a private gym. It is not a public space. A public space where you could record someone without their consent would be a sidewalk outdoors (although this is still not legal depending on your country/state). And as the post states I did not raise my voice. The whole point of me asking is because I do not want to be in someone\u2019s tiktok for example", "I really feel 'if I see people recording I just stop and do something else' should NOT be the normal. People should stop filming. If the gym doesn't have rules about it, you cannot really do anything about it, but talk to the person. But people should talk to them, it's just not okay to be on someones ONLINE video. That could be seen by everyone. It's not just a video for private use. And that's kind of messed up. If you do want to film yourself, make sure there's nobody in the background. Or just don't, enjoy your workout and don't make it a public thing.", "how do you know it\u2019ll never affect him? they could be posting it on tiktok and it could go viral and he could become a meme. a lot of people have become memes accidentally this way. OP is totally justified in taking precaution to not have that happen.", "Lol good point", "ESH\n\ni would be more inclined to side with op if they were secretly filming him and others. if they were legitimately recording each other, they could have been more conscientious to have only her in frame (which they claimed was true) and he could have handled it more tactfully.", "that's completely irrelevant, so you are most definitely the same generation as those two girls.", "This is in Canada not the states. And again \u201cpublic space\u201d is something like a sidewalk outdoors, not inside a private establishment. In Canada, you have a reasonable expectation of privacy inside private establishments, and people cannot record you with audio and video without your consent. There is an exception for CCTV because it is only video. Getting into legal specifics is really missing the point but I do think there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Sure its not explicitly against the rules. But am I an asshole because i dont want to be in their tiktok?", "> taking videos and pics in most public scenarios is protected by the first amendment.\n\nFirst Amendment only protects you if the government is trying to restrict your actions. That isn\u2019t the case at all here.", "Oo sorry it's late you said did not raise your voice and I read it as I did raise my voice lol. But I mean public places like my thing happened to be in a gym too and the thing was specially of me because I wear crazy outfits. I just let it go.i just go at like 530 AM now.", "Recording inside a gym should not be permitted. \nIt\u2019s just creepy.", "NTA it\u2019s a gym not a studio. This has become a problem.", "I\u2019m a sweaty mess at the gym and for a long time was super self conscious to the point that it put me off going. It took me a long time to convince myself that no one else cared what I looked like, that everyone was there to do their thing and get on with their life. If I thought someone had filmed me, I would feel violated. \n\nNot gonna lie, I would go full Karen in a situation like this. Call the gym manager or get clarification on email. I\u2019m sure there is some sort of privacy clause in your membership agreement. If there is nothing noted in the agreement then ask the gym to outline their policy and communicate it to their members.", "NTA\n\nAlso, request to speak to a member of management at the gym, let them know you were recorded without your consent and you were made to feel very uncomfortable and give descriptions of the members.\n\nThen, if it *does* happen again; repeat this process. There will be an incident report of the first situation, that this will be added to. Now ask that they please take action. \n\nGyms want members that pay their dues, not influencers using their facility to try to get likes and money for themselves, there\u2019s literally no benefit to a gym allowing an influencer to use their equipment and potentially cost them memberships. If gym members are being recorded by other members without their consent and posted online, that\u2019s going to potentially end up costing them money. \n\nI used to manage a gym, and if I had a single complaint they\u2019d get a warning, but if I had multiple complaints of someone recording someone else without their permission that persons membership would get canceled.", "NTA, but as soon as you see something like that happening again, start BLASTING Disney songs. Can't be published, and they will have a hard time asking you to not do it, seeing as they more then likely filmed you again.", "NTA, it\u2019s hard enough for some people to even work out in public around other people let alone have to worry about ending up in peoples online videos and tik toks.", "Exactly. Exercising is great and should be encouraged even more, but for some reason if someone walked in on me doing pushups in my room I would die of cringe. I certainly don\u2019t want to be scrolling on some app and see myself struggling for air in the background of someone\u2019s video.

I sincerely hope we, as a society, look back on this in a couple of years and feel intense amounts of shame.", "I'd like to add that some people are evading stalkers.\n\nWhy should TikTok videoing make it unsafe for a stalking victim to get exercise?\n\nMy own stalker lives in a different town than me. Were I captured, my location and current appearance would be published online.\n\nIt is never okay to video in a private space without the explicit consent of each and every person present.", "Nobody is stalking anybody, holy shit.", "NTA\n\nMost gyms have a no-recording policy, but since yours isn't there, that's something you can speak to the management about, but only regarding your discomfort and not the girls who were recording.\n\nAside from that, the recent trend of Instagram influencers shaming people for looking at them while they're working out, is something you have to check with since you could be accused of being a creep.", "NTA for asking, but you have no expectation of privacy when you are in a public area. Or a private area where there are no policies excluding photography. \n\nIf you want to have a work out without being filmed you should find a gym that excludes photography, work out at home, or speak with gym management to see about including a policy. \n\nSounds like these girls were taking photos of themselves\u2026 not exactly the most unreasonable thing this day and age.

Next to us was a couple that seemed to only interact with one another via their phones. Or with others. I dunno. And the looks on their faces, there's genereally more cheer at funerals.\n\nSo suddenly, this bloke picked up his phone to make a selfie. We'd *definitely* be ion the frame. I didn't confront them, neither did I *want* to, but I was trying to contort my face. My girlfriend put a stop to that, which I think she kind of regrets now.\n\nNTA.

Since you know apparently \"everyone makes workout videos\"", "NTA - in my country there's a law stating that you have the rights to any pictures or videos taken of you and it prohibits people from using your pictures publicly. I guess these girls want to use the video for IG or something similar so that would be highly illegal in my country if you were on that video too.", "NTA US law on filming is bizarre.", "NTA because of how you handled it politely. But I will say there is no expectation of privacy in public. Even though I do believe a gym should feel like a safe space.", "If you want to check your form that's why there are mirrors. It should be banned in every gym imo\n\nNTA", "The glut of videos where girls focus on getting guys to look then flame them for creeping is more than enough reason for gyms to implement a zero filming policy or a bo filming section of gym space.\nYou're nta OP.\nYou're just saying what alot of us are thinking. \nI think lots of people are uncomfortable being shot however innocently in videos.", "ESH - Understandable that you don't want to be the background of someone else's video, but while in a gym you have no expectations of privacy, except in the changing area's.\n\nBeing an adult means that there's a reasonable expectation for you to be aware and present, therefore moving into an area where they were recording was the second step to there being an issue.\n\nThe first step was that the girls were recording without much consideration or being present and considerate. It takes no effort to say or ask that someone avoid being where they are for 5 minutes so that they can complete their video and be out of the way.\n\nThis lead to the inevitable resentment or confrontation to delete the video.\n\nBoth parties sucked equally here for failing to adult until confrontation was inevitable.", "Assuming this is in US. They really don\u2019t have to delete anything. You basically lose any protection of privacy the second you step foot off your property.  Most private establishments will have policy against photography, but if they do not you have no leg to stand on. Not to mention you are most likely already being recorded the entire time you\u2019re in the gym by the gym itself. \n\nPeople are protected under the first amendment to record anything they like in public areas and it\u2019s up to private businesses to protect their clients via internal policy.", "I agree with your social media point but in to give another perspective\u2014 I\u2019ve had trainers and physical therapists ask me to record workouts so I can self-check or they can check my form.", "> a huge invasion of privacy\n\nin a public place you have ZERO expectation of privacy though.", "That's all fine, as long as it doesn't contain material of people who do not want to be recorded.", "That's a) not true and depends on the jurisdiction and b) a private gym is not a public place.", "Inside a gym is not a public place....  membership is required, making it quite anti public.  For purposes of this law anyway.  I am a fre3 speech advocate and filming in public while in public is certainly allowable and legal, that right ends when you enter a private facility."]}
