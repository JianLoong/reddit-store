We\u2019ve been together for a few months and thanksgiving will be the first time she\u2019s going to meet my parents.\n\nI am half Japanese, my dad is Japanese my mother is American. My mother learned Japanese so she can connect with my paternal side of the family. Me and my siblings all speak Japanese. However, none of my siblings spouses do.\n\nMy girlfriend, Sasha, started learning Japanese before it got popular, she started learning it when she was 14, has both, BA and MA in Japanese and Translation & Interpreting. She sounds as close to a native speaker as possible. \n\nHowever, I wanted her that she shouldn\u2019t try and speak Japanese when meeting my parents or grandparents and that she\u2019s forbidden from using it even when I\u2019m usi it with my siblings. \n\nShe asked why and I told her that I\u2019d hate for my Sils and Bills to be uncomfortable because they don\u2019t speak it and I don\u2019t want her to become my parents/grandparents favorite because we\u2019ve only been together a few months and it wouldn\u2019t be fair if they liked her more than my sil of 10 years who doesn\u2019t speak Japanese.\n\nShe said that\u2019s ridiculous and she shouldn\u2019t have to hide it. I said that perhaps later when we\u2019ve been together for longer.\n\nShe asked if she had to pretend not to understand me and my siblings when we talk. And I said, exactly. She got really weird and went home. She\u2019s been kind of distant lately and I told a friend about this and they said that I was a major AH and if they ask her about her job, she\u2019s have to lie as well. I admit, I hadn\u2019t thought of that. But I still can\u2019t see that I did anything wrong. So AITA for demanding she lies?", "created_utc": 1668798698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyrzf9/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_she_cant/", "score": 6998, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe you should have just told her that you don\u2019t see the relationship as having any real future so you don\u2019t want your family getting too attached to her because that is basically what your nonsensical prohibition amounts to. Also, if you actually cared about not leaving out the in-laws then NO ONE would speak Japanese.", "**YTA**- OP. Your girlfriend has a cool and unique skill that she would very rarely have opportunity to use in the US. She can communicate with your parents and siblings in a language that could be more comfortable to them. \n\nIf you're going to make demands that **someone** not speak japanese in the household so as not to make in-laws uncomfortable, maybe consider communicating that with **EVERYONE** who speaks japanese. Don't just exclude **your GF** to avoid excluding your BIL/SILs. If she can't speak japanese, no one should. \n\nAnd if telling your parents and siblings not to speak japanese sounds like an asshole move, then maybe use that context to analyze your initial request. Because it's a super asshole move.", "YTA - You can't \"forbid\" her from speaking Japanese.  She's your girlfriend, not your employee.  You can ask her not to, but what she ultimately does is up to her.\n\nBesides, your reason for \"forbidding\" it is dumb.  She speaks Japanese.  That's a fact.  There's no reason to pretend that she doesn't.", "YTA. Are you serious? This is insane. You\u2019re telling her to lie and to be ashamed of her skills, which are both her life\u2019s passion and her actual occupation. This is horrifically controlling and disturbing.", "YTA\n\nYou may as well end the relationship now.\n\nIf she pretends to \"not understand\" and the relationship continues she will have to hide the part of her life, her job, her expertise for the rest of her life with you. OR Eventually she lets everyone know she has been able to speak it & she or you gets blamed for hiding it and accusations of listening in on conversations get thrown around.\n\nDid you ever think that your grandparents may enjoy having conversations in their native language?\n\nYou know she could listen to the native tongue & answer in English if she wants. Your girlfriend is intelligent.\n\nIf your siblings spouses by this time haven't invested the time to learn any Japanese for greetings and pleasantries, that is on them. THEY are already part of the family and have chosen not to.", "YTA...a dumb one at that.  Your reasoning is stupid and I doubt your parents will appreciate you having your gf lie for you.  This relationship will be over soon.", "YTA. In spades. You forbade her?", "YTA. Your parents speak Japanese. Your gf speaks Japanese. They can speak Japanese to each other. Clearly neither your parents or your gf is rude enough to speak Japanese an a group conversation and exclude the non-Japanese speakers.\n\nWhat would you do if you broke up with gf, and started dating someone who also happened to be Japanese - would you expect them to pretend that they weren't actually Japanese?", "YTA. Holy lord in heaven, YTA. She took the time to learn Japanese and your siblings' spouses didn't, but she has to pretend she doesn't speak Japanese so people who didn't put in that effort don't get their feelings hurt? Are you listening to yourself??", "YTA- Let\u2019s break this down \n\nYou want her to lie to your family. \n\nYou want her to play stupid and act dumb.\n\nI hope she dumps you.", "YTA\n\nAsking someone to pretend not to understand a language that they're fluent in is an absolutely ridiculous request.

That\u2019s so cute, and it\u2019s a legitimately kind gesture. Of all the things to make a *thing* out of. Let her speak Japanese, damn!", "YTA. Not only are you preventing her from connecting with your family, you\u2019re also asking her to lie and pretend she doesn\u2019t understand what you\u2019re all saying. All for the reason so your in laws, who are likely 100% used to this, won\u2019t feel left out? I think you need to think deeply about why you\u2019re asking her to do this.", "\"So AITA for demanding she lies?\"\n\nLOL yes, massive YTA. \n\nIf the rest of you rudely speaking Japanese in front of family who don't speak it is acceptable, she should be able to do it too.", "YTA - who appointed you the Japanese language police? Hopefully gf tell you to sayonara!", "YTA, she\u2019s trying really hard to try to form a good relationship with your family and you\u2019re rejecting that on the basis of people who shouldn\u2019t even care. Why do that to her?", "YTA \n\nYou should never ever ask your partner to lie about who they are and what they do. You're being insecure on behalf of your in-laws and that's not healthy.

If you want her not to speak Japanese, don't speak it at all there. \n\nDo your grandparents speak English?\n\n\nYou've only been together a few months...but what if you stayed together (very understandable if she doesn't want to). Should she hide it for the rest of her life? Nope, can't speak it with her own kids?", "YTA\nYou\u2019re essentially saying she has to hide a big portion of her life, and act a completely different way than who she is. \nWhy is it her problem in anyway, shape or form that your siblings S/Os don\u2019t know Japanese? Maybe she could teach them. \n\nSince this relationship isn\u2019t so long, she probably is rethinking why bother continuing it.

Close enough to bring her to Thanksgiving but not close enough to form a relationship with your parents. If your parents are so shallow to pick a favorite based on such a thing then your whole family has problems. \n\nYTA.", "YTA, how do you think this is going to pan out later on? You are going to pretend she suddenly speaks fluent Japanese when she didn't a year prior? How is everybody else going to feel when they realize that she could understand everything they have been saying all this time? And for what exactly? I'm sorry but this is such a dumb idea", "YTA dude seriously you are creating issues where there are no issues, your gf is an independent person who like you works as an interpreter if she is capable of speaking the language she is free to engage. Also being able to engage in japanese is good for honing her skills. Dont't hold her back, if your inlaws actually feel left out they could always try to learn the language.", "YTA. Duh.", "YTA. Maybe you don't see this are super controlling, but it is. It's also weirdly invested in how your parents interact with your siblings' partners. None of this is your job to manage or oversee. This is wild overreach that will actually hamper your GF (if she sticks around, because I definitely wouldn't want to be subject to these kinds of rules from a partner) in her interactions. \n\nAlso, way to prioritize literally everyone in your family over your GF. Are they asking you to do this? Either way, maybe it's time to let everyone run their own lives and their own relationships and you can concentrate on yours.", "YTA\n\nEspecially for \"demanding\" it. I don't blame her for walking out and being distant whatsoever. If your SILs and BILs don't like it, then they can go learn the language. This is not your girlfriend's problem at all and your family will think it's incredibly weird that she lied (if they find out).", "YTA - Your logic is absolutely ridiculous and I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s coming from a 35 year old man. If she has to lie to your family in order for you to feel comfortable, then you aren\u2019t ready for her to meet your family. Btw - It would be much worse for her with your family to pretend she doesn\u2019t know the language\u2026and then later reveal that she\u2019s fluent.", "Not only are you the AH...you're a control freak AH and the sooner she kicks your sorry arse to the curb the better off she'll be.", "YTA. Speaking Japanese is clearly a huge part of who she is and her identity. She majored in it, she's a translator, I'm guessing it plays a role in your connection to each other since you are both translators. Why would you ask a partner (clearly she's not) to hide who they are?\n\nWhat do you expect her to say when your family asks her about what she does for work or where she went to school or what her degree is? This is routine small talk, especially when meeting family. \n\nHow did you meet? If you say school or work, I'm gonna die, cause that right there would be a huge giveaway that she speaks Japanese.", "YTA.\n\n1) You\u2019re making rules over a silly \u201cwhat if\u201d\n2) You\u2019re not only asking her to lie (which when the family finds out they might dislike her for) BUT you\u2019re willing to lie to your own family.\n3)Trust can\u2019t be built on lies. How do you think your family will feel if they realized she understood them that whole time AND if they don\u2019t say some nice things about her. \n\nIf I had someone ordering me around and telling me what I can and can\u2019t do, I\u2019d be rethinking the relationship.", "YTA-why do you care so much about your in laws? This is a great opportunity for your gf to connect with your family?

That is very silly and weird of you - your siblings partners are free to try and learn Japanese if they would like and I agree it would be rude if they conducted the entire event in Japanese but it's super weird that you're asking another adult to behave like this. Do you want her to lie about her job as well? Because that's going to come up as probably one of the first four things they're going to ask her.", "YTA So the feelings of everyone else matters more than the feelings of ur gf, huh? Why does she need to lie to u expect her to lie her whole life or that she is going to embarrasse herself and you bc u got her to lie about everything?", "Yes, YTA. Honestly, it's just not practical. She's an interpreter by trade and as close to a native speaker as it gets and you're asking her to pretend she doesn't know the language that is a cornerstone of her working life? How did you think that was going to work? Your best solution was just for her to pretend she doesn't know the language--not discuss the your worries about the situation, talk about  making sure you try to keep in-laws involved in conversations so not dominating the convo with Japanese, etc. Also, your SILs and BILs are in a family full of fluent Japanese speakers--why would just her speaking it suddenly make them all uncomfortable? They've had years to learn, if they don't want to they don't have to, but I think they're old enough to understand other people in the world might. Also, you might (and that's a big might) have gotten off as just silly/kind of dumb for asking this if you had actually asked. But *prohibiting* and *demanding*? That's practically an auto-AH move.", "Yeah YTA. Pretty much any time someone says they \"forbid\" their partner from doing something, they're crossing into arsehole territory. Your girlfriend can speak Japanese. That ability is part of who she is. It's something she worked hard for. It's something she's good at. And you're telling her she can't, without any good reason. \n\nMoreover you're saying that she needs to lie about it, which you must know will put her in an even worse position in the future - whereby she needs to either keep up the lie or, if she ever reveals that she can speak Japanese, come across as untrustworthy to your family.\n\nI don't know what your real motivations are but this is very controlling and I hope she sees it as the red flag it is.", "YTA and insecure af. If you don't want her speaking Japanese, you shouldn't either, nor should anyone else if it's really about making the non-speaking in-laws feel comfortable... What's the real reason???", "YTA if you don't think it's fair for your in-laws who don't speak Japanese why are you speaking it in front of them ??

By forcing her to **lie and put on an act for your sake**, all you are doing is sabotaging the reputation of your girlfriend in the eyes of your family and especially your parents. \n\nWhat happens at Thanksgiving when one of your parents ask her what she studied in college and what degrees she holds?\n\nAnd should, by some slim chance, they don't ask her about her college education, how in the hell do you think it's going to go in the future when you give the okay to speak Japanese to your father and mother? \n\nShe lies for **you**, she's the one that will suffer the most. That's some pretty selfish requests.", "YTA and a oblivious one at that. Maybe you should try to focus on engineering instead. Use the new skill to build a bridge and use it to get over yourself.", "YTA\n\nIf you are not ready to commit (which this seems to be about) then be honest and don't take her to meet your family, but don't use such a bullsh*t reason.\n\nYou don't want her to become your parents' favorite SO? Why are you so concerned about your SILs and BILs feelings but don't care about your GFs? \n\nWhy do you want to DUMB her down?

I thought you were in your late teens!", "Yes YTA. In multiple ways. Not only did you ask her to lie, you also told her you didn't want your parents to like her.\n\nNormally people are thrilled that their parents like their partner. You know who isn't thrilled?

This in no way diminishes the partners of your siblings.\n\nFinally, she's distant because this was a pretty red flag in a new relationship.

Congratulations!", "YTA.\n\nYou are being controlling and demanding by telling your gf, who worked hard to learn the language and who clearly loves it, to lock that part of herself away and lie.  How will that go down later, when it's revealed that she spoke Japanese fluently this whole time? \n\nYour in-laws seem to already be married, so I don't see how they should be threatened by someone merely sharing a language with someone. Is there something else going on here? You seem really caught up in a fear of favoritism or something. Are you unsure about committing to her and worried about awkwardness with your parents if you break up? Do you have some rivalry with your siblings where this would be seen as you \"showing them up\"? \n\nBTW, I'm a mixed race Korean-Japanese-white person, who learned and spoke Japanese in school and whose Korean grandparents were ecstatic to be able to speak with me in one of their stronger languages (even though they lived through the Japanese occupation). It means SO much to older generations, especially if they're not living in their mother country, to be able to converse and share.  And since she's new to the family, it would be a great way to help your parents feel comfortable with her. \n\nI also know that Asian families can have a lot of trauma and other issues, so if there is something like that going on, you should hash that out or get some help working through it.

A decent (or even vaguely reasonable) guy would have been really happy that his girlfriend is fluent in both the languages his family speaks.", "And on top of that: the French really don't all speak English (especially the older generation) and some refuse to. I find it impossible to get by without using French!", "Exactly. Good job getting rid of her. \n\nMy bf is monolingual, though he can imitate accents pretty well. I have a couple languages, and so do most of my friends. \n\nHe sent me a video from I Love Lucy where she gets arrested in France, I think, and the jail scene is her asking a question in English, Desi translates English to Spanish, cop translates Spanish to Italian, head cop understands Italian but responds in French then the response goes back up the line. He wrote \"I want a video of you and your friends doing something like this, it's AWESOME!!\" With a bunch of laughy faces. I ended up doing something similar at a Metro stop in Germany (I don't have German, but I do have minimal french, french guy had Italian, Italian had German), so we spent 6 minutes with me conversing with a German lady with the Frenchman and Italian in the middle. Good time had by all. \n\nBf was thrilled. Still my bf, matter of fact going to call him right now to let him know I appreciate him.

It\u2019s mind boggling how he thought this was an ok thing to do. \nAlso if he is this fine lying to his family over something simple like this, imagine how comfortable he must be lying to her\u2026", "YTA but hopefully you\u2019re single now so what does it all matter", "What future! She's going to dump him. \"Forbidden!\" I can't believe he wrote all this and doesn't know he's the AH. OP, YTA. Your girlfriend is way out of your league. I thank you on her behalf for letting her know what an AH you are so she can free herself to find a good man.", "This is such a weird request. The in-laws could\u2019ve learned Japanese if it mattered that much and gf spoke it before the relationship, she didn\u2019t learn it. to suck up to the family. YTA", "But you forget that this would make her the families favorite lmao that means he has to marry her because she is already fitting into the family better than the other in laws lmao its all about him not wanting his parents to pressure him into marriage", "I was thinking that the girlfriend wasn't old enough for that to be true.", "Plot twist: the two in-laws have come clean to each other years ago and routinely meet up for Japanese conversation between them behind their spouses backs.", "OP hit the girlfriend lottery and he blew it.", "Yeah, I mean, it's super rude if they're all hanging out in a big group with SIL and BIL who only speak English, and they're like \"Nope, we gotta have all this insider conversation in Japanese.\" It's clear from the post English is the common language. It's not like there are some family members who only speak Japanese. If SIL and BIL feel bad.... well, they've been excluded from conversations for years! I kinda think this whole family might suck, which is where OP got it from.", "Seems like this is a rationalization but not the true reason OP wants his gf to play dumb. The \"she started learning Japanese before it was cool\" line is suspect. Something about this dynamic is triggering some intense and bizarre insecurity for OP.", "Let\u2019s all remember the American living in Germany for 15 years, having a German spouse and newborn, and wanting his newborn to learn Only English, no German whatsoever. \n\nBecause OP doesn\u2019t speak German nor do the kids from his first marriage that he left behind in the US, so it\u2019s OnLy FaIr that this baby be monolingual too.", "The SIL has had *ten years*. \n\nI get it. Learning languages is hard but if in ten years you haven\u2019t learned a few basic phrases to communicate and connect with your spouses family it\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to and you don\u2019t get to be sensitive that another person knows the language.", "She was FORBIDDEN and then she \"got really weird\". Absolutely, she's the one being weird", "Exactly! If SIL of *10 flippin' years* hasn't bothered to learn the language and would still be devastated/embarrassed by a 10 *month* girlfriend speaking Japanese in a Japanese home, she would be as much of an AH as OP. (Raging YTA)", ">I've been around multilingual families. It's a bit different. They don't usually just talk in the other language, its for clarification, short sections, or when you're not around.\n\nI've found this really varies! I've been around lots of situations where there's a mix of English, Spanish, and \"Spanglish\" which is what you describe. But I've also been in multilingual situations where it's clear the second language is being used specifically to exclude others from parts of the conversation. I made one situation *really* awkward when someone insulted someone's girlfriend in Spanish and I clapped back in English, making it clear that I understood the original insult.\n\nIt's lovely that your family is nice! Unfortunately some aren't.", "This was my interpretation too. It is not aboit the current in laws looking bad, it is about his future wife looking bad as OP knows that current GF is not future wife.", "Well it's a problem if he thinks this is a temporary thing and he didn't see a future in it."]}
