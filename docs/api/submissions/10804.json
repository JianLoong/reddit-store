However, my little sister 24f hates this idea. She is the only one in my bridal party that isn't married so she would be the only one that wouldn't be wearing a wedding dress. She has been engaged for 4 years and her and her fiance are always breaking up so she doesn't have a dress. I told her since my wedding is 2 years away I could help her buy a pretty white dress.

There are awesome white dresses out there that aren't wedding dresses.", "NTA. No different than any other wedding wear request.

Almost zero men have white suits. You're basically asking everyone in attendance to buy new clothing. Not really the AH. Buti would just decline the invite, not buying a whole new white suit I'd never wear again just for your wedding", "NTA and I don't think what you said makes you an AH either.

The title of your post said \"wedding guests\" but then the post itself made it sound like just the bridal party.\n\nIf it's just your bridal party then I don't think picking white as a color is any different from choosing any other color. NTA.\n\nIf you're asking your wedding GUESTS to all come wearing a certain color, especially white... that's a bit much and YTA. Everything is so expensive with inflation and no one wants to have to go buy white clothes to attend a wedding.", "YTA I\u2019m so tired of people getting married and demanding a certain color dress code. What if Someone looks bad in white or hates the color? And many women hate wearing white when they have their period. Weddings cost a lot to attend and now you want people to buy and wear something they hate and/or are uncomfortable in? And yes,\nThey have the choice to not attend, but then don\u2019t get pissed off if they choose not to.", "YTA for both reasons - the jab at your friend and the color request to the guests.  I've never owned an all-white outfit (and I have a fair amount of semiformal wear) and would never wear a wedding dress to someone else's wedding.  It's cream anyway.", "Based on the question asked NTA, but I think you know yourself that what you said was shitty. Also, if she's a bridesmaid then you should really be paying for the dress anyway.", "NTA --- Your wedding your rules, I read another AMA not long ago about how a very nasty MIL wanted to upstage the bride so the MIL and the groom's sisters all brought the same dress as the bride and were going to turn up at the wedding in the same dresses as the bride, only she found out so she chose another colour dress for herself and when she sent out the invites she told them all wear your wedding dresses come in white only everyone was sworn to secrecy so on the day of the wedding everyone turned up in white or their wedding dress no one even looked at the MIL and everyone had a blast.", "Your title is not addressing the problem. It sounds like your sister doesn't have a problem with wearing white, her problem is that everyone will be wearing a wedding dress except her and she will feel left out.\n\nNo, you aren't responsible for her relationship and engagement being rocky, but she is your sister and I can really see how immensely shitty that situation would be for her. \n\nShe is your sister and is in your bridal party, so I assume you like her. I think you two should have a nice long heart to heart where you both have an opportunity to share your feelings and maybe come up with a solution together. \n\nHowever, my honest judgment is YTA because it sounds like you went nuclear right away even though it's clear your sister is struggling. What you said to her was cruel and humiliating.", "Ok soft YTA for how you spoke to your sister. There's obviously something going on in her relationship and she might need support rather than scorn.\n\nThe rest isn't the issue here and actually sounds lovely! I got married in black, but would love to go get a white dress for something like this! (Although if anyone is struggling/not married, can I suggest they take a look at the dresses on Shein? The quality is great and there are cheap white wedding-style dresses.)", "ESH. I was on your side until that comment. Meet with your sister and apologize to each other.", "It\u2019s split here. NTA for your choice of theme of wedding, but YTA for what you said to your sister. Don\u2019t be surprised she goes NC for what you said. Apologize to her for what you said.", "NTA for the wedding color scheme. For your sister, you already know !", "YTA \n\nNormally I\u2019d say \u201cmeh, your wedding do what you want\u201d but there\u2019s a difference between asking people to wear white and asking all the women to wear their wedding dresses.\n\nAlso your response to your sister explaining that she felt left out/ targeted was just rude as fuck.", ">you and your loser boyfriend can't stay together long enough to pick wedding colors let alone actually get married\n\nIn what world would  that not mean YTA ?", "So this is really about your criticism of her loser boyfriend. ESH, in the sense that you should emphasize that your sister deserves someone that treats her well.", "Well, certainly YTA in the way you went about this.", "Lol... okay, yeah, that could have been worded better.   But the thing is, you weren't wrong.  She's not really pissed about your wedding, she's pissed at her lack of a wedding.  And you're getting the blowback.  She might not even realize it, but that's the deal.  \n\nYour theme is cooler than the flip side of the pillow! It's your wedding - you want it to be wonderful and memorable and unique, so you remember it forever. And this definitely qualifies!  Congratulations, have a great time, and most emphatically NTA!", "YTA\n\nNot because you had the idea to invite your guests to wear white. That is a lovely and creative thought! YTA because you called her fianc\u00e9 a loser, and insulted her life choices. Even if he truly is no gem, and your sister has made bad decisions with him, you could have been kinder in responding to her.", "Oh yea you\u2019re an AH for what you said to your sister, why\u2019d you need to do that? I guess you guys have issues not relevant to this post\u2026 \n\n\nAnyway NTA for the idea of the wedding theme. I think it\u2019s awesome! Those who doesn\u2019t have an ole wedding dress in the closet can just go in any white dress.", "NTA for the theme, if that's what you want, that's what you want. i mean, i think it's weird, but it's not my wedding. you definitely shouldn't have said that to your sister, that's pretty mean. but asking people to wear white or wear their former wedding dresses doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA for the request but your sister feeling left out is completely valid since you've assumed the bridal party want to wear their old wedding dresses. Also, I dunno if this is a cultural thing but I would have assumed that if she's a bridesmaid then you'd be buying her dress anyway.", "NTA. Your wedding your rules....\n\n\n\nHowever please be polite to your sis... if possible.", "NTA for the colours, but YTA for what you said to her. I'm sure she is suffering enough from her situation without you rubbing it in.", "NTA for the theme, it looks like most people are pretty excited about it. \nYou did hit your sister exactly where it hurts though.", "Soft YTA- the comment hurt your sister. \u201cYour loser bf\u201d  harsh, it implies she picks loser. You could and should have phrased it differently. \n\nWedding party wearing white, you can decide what you want, the delviery is where you are the AH\n\nInfo - are you requiring/requesting the guests to wear white or does it just apply to the wedding party?", "NTA for the theme of your wedding. It's a great one! It's too bad your sister feels left out but this is YOUR wedding. You know you were the AH for what you said, but you aren't responsible for her feelings. Those are hers to manage. I'd say apologize for being unkind with your words but don't let her make you change your fantastic wedding theme!", "Nta,   for the colour selection.\n\nHowever your wedding party will look like a junble sale if people wear their taste in wedding dresses.\n\nStick to white, and choose a white dress. Tell them they can change into wedding dresses at reception.", "Eh... slight YTA. \n\nFirst, I love your idea for your wedding party. It sounds fun as hell and I love that this post isn't about you and your sister with the more traditional wedding having competitive drama! \n\nThat said,  not having had a wedding yet is obviously a sore point for your other sister,  if she has been \"engaged\" for four years.  She should probably just dump her fiancee and move on,  but setting that aside-- imagine this was about infertility instead, and she had been trying to conceive for four years.  Let's say you had a cute baby shower idea in which each person would bring one used baby item their kids had loved instead of a gift. Now imagine you told your sister with infertility that she can just buy a gift instead, or that she doesn't have to give you anything. Can you see how painful that would be? You aren't just having your bridesmaids wear white,  they're wearing wedding dresses,  and so this does actually leave little sister out in a quite painful way.  Yet instead of being kind about this sore spot for her,  you threw it in her face. (You sound like a good sister and a nice person,  but that was unkind.)\n\nI think you should let this idea go for now and apologize to your sister for being insensitive.  Have that movie day! Nobody needs to buy gowns for a wedding two years away yet,  so shelve this for now. (Also, your other sister might have kids or be pregnant within two years-- no guarantee she can wear her wedding dress then either. ) Maybe everyone will still fit in their wedding dresses and little sister will be already married by then, and you can revisit this idea with her! Otherwise,  I'm sure you'll come up with something else fun as hell to do-- you've got time.\n\nEdit: One other idea: If you feel good about little sis being maid of honor,  tell her she can wear a different color and style to stand out in a good way!", "Well, there\u2019s no getting around that your comment makes you TA. But for the general theme of your wedding? Not at all. It\u2019s your day. It\u2019s certainly not traditional for everyone except the bride to wear white, but tradition isn\u2019t everything.", "As you already admitted to being an asshole for the way in which you spoke to your sister, I will not vote on that, but rather your question about the theme and colors of your wedding.\n\nIts' your wedding, you pick the theme.  You pick the colors.  And you get to decide to suspend the traditional etiquette rule about no one except the bride wearing white. \n\nNTA.", "YTA because 11 months ago you made an AITA post saying you're 21f so I know they're likely both fake stories. NTA in this scenario but the rules say no fake posts.", "NTA\n\n>She was still pissed off at me because\n\nthe wedding is not about her.", "NTA. I love your idea to have the bridal party wear white and/or wedding dresses. Lol, I wish I was your bridesmaid. I am also in the US, and every wedding I have been in has required me to buy my own bridesmaid dress, it is pretty common here.", "You didn't need to insult her.  You should apologize for that.  But you can do whatever you want with your wedding, it's your day.", "Way to bury the lede. YTA for that and your comments to your sister. The rest is fine", "NTA. Wedding dresses for everyone sounds like so much fun! Love the idea.\n\nPerhaps your sister should be enlightened that your wedding day is not all about her, and that she can either get on board, or stay home.", "Eh- NTA, however, you should have brought up the fact her fianc\u00e9 is a loser in a different conversation than this specific one relating to multiple people wearing wedding dresses to your wedding. Im a strong believer in being honest when someone is in a shitty relationship, and an on again off again thing is not a thing you want to marry into. She may need extra support in that situation but it may now be more sore. Idk", "Nta she can wear any white dress, not just a wedding. Heck, after prom the dresses are deeply discounted and there's usually some white ones.", "NTA, I'm willing to bet this isn't the first time she's been a downer because she's not married.", "YTA\n\nI know you have a vision for a perfect look to your wedding and you are thinking of your sister mostly but I feel telling guests what to wear is an asshole move especially a color people might not have in their wardrobe.\n\n Some people might be able to wear their old wedding dress again but many can not fit in it or do not have one. A lot of people are not going to have other occasions to wear a fancy white dress again so would have to shell out for a one time use dress for your wedding. Some people really don\u2019t enjoy wearing white. \n\nMaybe everyone you would invite would love it but possibly more are like your sister than you think.", "NTA. This wedding sounds like so much fun!! But Y T A for the comment. That being said, siblings argue and act like assholes. It happens. Just take responsibility and I'm sure she'll forgive you. But she also needs to stop acting like she is regarding the dress. It isn't her wedding.", "NTA\n\nThis is such a cute and fun idea! She could easily find a wedding-style dress to wear to your wedding in 2 years. Being married is not a requirement for wearing a white dress to a wedding! Her anger is real but it's misplaced and unfortunately, you're the target.", "You can find beautiful white long prom dresses. She could wear one of those", "NTA She will get over it.", "NTA\n\nFor wanting everyone to wear white. It is your wedding. You get to choose. You do not have to consult anyone about the decor or esthetic or food or partying of your wedding.", "See you're not wrong we just can't say that to her lol", "I think the op only called the boyfriend a loser but still mean", "I didn't mean to call her a loser I only meant her boyfriend. But yeah your judgment is fair", "Thank you.  I'm definitely going to make it up to her and apologize for what I said", "Yeah I'm gonna do something nice for her", "I was rude and need to apologize because I know she is going through a hard time with my sister and I both getting married too. I am going to make it up to her", "The sister may need some perspective, but being rude about it usually only leads to trouble and hurt feelings.", "My bridal party has to wear white but my guests can if they would like and are able to too. I just want to be the only one in black", "I have had to pay for every single bridesmaids dress for every wedding I've been in. It's not that outrageous to ask for your bridesmaids to buy a dress. Normally what we do is you pick a color and then the bridesmaid picks the style and everything so they can get it at a price they like", "That's what I think, too. For the married women this will be a fun nostalgic time with their old dresses on. For the unmarried one, this will be very awkward-- she may feel like the child playing make believe, or at least like the odd man out. \n\nI think NAH or maybe ESH. Apologies are in order all around.\n\nI really love the idea of the dark bride with white bridesmaids. It sounds so elegant and tailored to OP. Very nice!\n\nA suggestion for you: is there another former bride that won't be wearing her dress? It could be really cool for Sister to wear her mom's or grandmother's wedding dress. Vintage vibe and family tradition and all that...", "Yeah I need to do something nice for her and apologize", "Yeah I need to apologize before this gets more out of hand", "Yeah I feel shitty about what I said. I'm gonna talk to her and try to apologize", "Yeah I need to apologize", "Definitely", "Yeah. I should have thought about how she felt because me and our other sister are getting married and she isn't", "Her and I just got into a heated argument and we said things we didn't mean. Im going to apologize to her", "Same here. I've been a Bridesmaid twice and my dresses were paid for.", "Not in the US or Canada, the bridal party generally covers their own expenses.", "I see you probably have a little sister lol.  I think we just blew up at each other. I'm gonna make it up to her", "Oh trust me, I know the feeling, it\u2019s difficult watching someone be in a relationship that is no good for them and just having to hope they eventually realise it.", "Yea that\u2019s definitely not going to get her sister on her side", "Maybe if you just apologize for that, and talk to her and explain it doesn\u2019t have to be a wedding dress she will come around!", "So are you specifically instructing your guests not to wear black? As people have pointed out most men\u2019s suits or suit jackets are going to be black, and a lot of women\u2019s cocktail dresses are black or have black in them, and inflation is a bitch. To be clear I don\u2019t think Y T A for the colors, but I do think your sister may not be the only one that feels left out, other people who aren\u2019t married, or recently broke up, got divorced, lost a spouse, I can see how it might be distressing for those people. Those are specific situations, and you know the guest list and if that would fit anyone, so it maybe it doesn\u2019t apply.", "Curious. I've never paid for either of mine. Same with hair and make up. In the UK that's typically at the Bride's expense.", "Please do, I was in your sisters position. We had some dumb argument over the fact that anything I do to help, she (and to some extent, our brother) never have anything encouraging to say. I told her \u201cyou treat me like I can\u2019t do anything right\u201d and she responded \"No you cant, lol\". \n\nAnd as much we were just as much to blame in our respective arguments, the other sister crossed the line. That\u2019s what siblings do. They know which buttons to push. Unfortunately, my sister and I still aren\u2019t talking after 3 months because she didn\u2019t take back what she said to me.", "Jealousy and grief are often joined together. Please give her a sincere apology for being unkind in your words. Maybe you can help her shop for a dress? It's a fun pre-wedding thing for sisters to do. Best wishes, and may you experience love and joy in your marriage!", "That\u2019s good, do that. I have a.. difficult relationship with my own sister, but I\u2019m glad none of us let it come to going NC. We often hate each other, but we\u2019ll still have each other\u2019s backs if it came to real trouble.\n\n\n\nGood luck on the wedding, your idea of going black with all the guests in white is truly amazing! I can\u2019t see why anyone would have a problem with that (quite the opposite actually, I think a lot of people are bummed out that they don\u2019t get to wear that white marshmallow of a dress one more time).", "I'm thinking of putting together a little movie day on the couch with her to apologize", "Ah I'm in America. And I'm a cosmetologist so I always do my own hair and makeup. But yeah it would be nice if they bought", "So this is one of those cultural differences. As far as I can tell the UK, the bride generally covers it but in the US and Canada, the bridesmaid covers her own dress (and many other expenses).", "Thank you!", "Your quick recognition of the comment and a sincere apology should go a long way. I suspect Sis is most upset with her fianc\u00e9 who won\u2019t set a date. Can you update us on how the apology goes?", " I've been a Bridesmaid twice and my dresses were paid for.", "u/BloodInforraju is a bot.
