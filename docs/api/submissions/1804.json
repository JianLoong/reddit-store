Met my now fiance 2 years ago and he has been great but issues sparked up recently in the safety department of things.\n\nHe got a 30-40lb small breed dog last year from his mother for Christmas. That in itself wasn't a deal breaking issue despite none of us wanting a dog. The issue is he refuses to go out with me or the kids anymore without bringing the dog, where he proceeds to drive with her on his lap. If this dog is not in his lap, she starts whining like absolute crazy and he just gives in and let's her sit in his lap. He has to lean backwards just so she isn't touching the steering wheel. There have been multiple times I have told him to stop doing this, because at this point he is putting all of our lives in danger. He will stop for a few weeks or so and then go right back to it. \n\nSo yesterday I absolutely had enough. I begged him to keep the dog home but he refused because he wanted to stop off at the park and let the kids and the dog run off energy. On the way home (like 6 miles from home) the dog climbs on his lap. He allows it. I immediately say that he needs to stop. He tells me I'm overthinking and need to live a little, that he isn't hurting anyone and that he's \"got this\". At one point snapping and saying \"we are almost fucking home, it's literally not a big deal\". So I told him to pull over and ended up taking me and my children out of the car to walk the rest of the way (at this point it was only roughly 2 miles away). He stops a few times and tells us to get back in and I refused because that dog was still on his lap. \n\nWhen we get home (after stopping with my kids for ice cream along the way) he goes up one side of me and the down the other, stating I'm petty and being controlling and whatever else. At this point I told him that not only would me and my kids not be doing any family outings with him anymore providing he brings his dog but we will also not be going anywhere with him unless I'm the one driving, which he absolutely hates because I \"don't drive fast enough\" (meaning I go the speed limit, whereas he goes 60+mph). I no longer feel I trust him with me or my children's safety when it comes to driving. He has not spoken to me since and my best friend is saying my fiance is right and that I'm being a controlling AH because it's \"not hurting anything but my feelings\". AITA?\n\nETA: Another commenter told me I should add to the original post regarding how I have spoken to my fiance multiple times regarding the safety issue. I have all but begged him not to do this and this is the first time I have snapped. However, with that said, my children's father died in a vehicle related accident, which makes my anxiety much worse regarding the issue.

Met my now fiance 2 years ago and he has been great but issues sparked up recently in the safety department of things.\n\nHe got a 30-40lb small breed dog last year from his mother for Christmas. That in itself wasn't a deal breaking issue despite none of us wanting a dog. The issue is he refuses to go out with me or the kids anymore without bringing the dog, where he proceeds to drive with her on his lap. If this dog is not in his lap, she starts whining like absolute crazy and he just gives in and let's her sit in his lap. He has to lean backwards just so she isn't touching the steering wheel. There have been multiple times I have told him to stop doing this, because at this point he is putting all of our lives in danger. He will stop for a few weeks or so and then go right back to it. \n\nSo yesterday I absolutely had enough. I begged him to keep the dog home but he refused because he wanted to stop off at the park and let the kids and the dog run off energy. On the way home (like 6 miles from home) the dog climbs on his lap. He allows it. I immediately say that he needs to stop. He tells me I'm overthinking and need to live a little, that he isn't hurting anyone and that he's \"got this\". At one point snapping and saying \"we are almost fucking home, it's literally not a big deal\". So I told him to pull over and ended up taking me and my children out of the car to walk the rest of the way (at this point it was only roughly 2 miles away). He stops a few times and tells us to get back in and I refused because that dog was still on his lap. \n\nWhen we get home (after stopping with my kids for ice cream along the way) he goes up one side of me and the down the other, stating I'm petty and being controlling and whatever else. At this point I told him that not only would me and my kids not be doing any family outings with him anymore providing he brings his dog but we will also not be going anywhere with him unless I'm the one driving. I no longer feel I trust him with me or my children's safety when it comes to driving. He has not spoken to me since and my best friend is saying my fiance is right and that I'm being a controlling AH because it's \"not hurting anything but my feelings\".
