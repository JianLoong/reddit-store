Met my now fiance 2 years ago and he has been great but issues sparked up recently in the safety department of things.\n\nHe got a 30-40lb small breed dog last year from his mother for Christmas. That in itself wasn't a deal breaking issue despite none of us wanting a dog. The issue is he refuses to go out with me or the kids anymore without bringing the dog, where he proceeds to drive with her on his lap. If this dog is not in his lap, she starts whining like absolute crazy and he just gives in and let's her sit in his lap. He has to lean backwards just so she isn't touching the steering wheel. There have been multiple times I have told him to stop doing this, because at this point he is putting all of our lives in danger. He will stop for a few weeks or so and then go right back to it. \n\nSo yesterday I absolutely had enough. I begged him to keep the dog home but he refused because he wanted to stop off at the park and let the kids and the dog run off energy. On the way home (like 6 miles from home) the dog climbs on his lap. He allows it. I immediately say that he needs to stop. He tells me I'm overthinking and need to live a little, that he isn't hurting anyone and that he's \"got this\". At one point snapping and saying \"we are almost fucking home, it's literally not a big deal\". So I told him to pull over and ended up taking me and my children out of the car to walk the rest of the way (at this point it was only roughly 2 miles away). He stops a few times and tells us to get back in and I refused because that dog was still on his lap. \n\nWhen we get home (after stopping with my kids for ice cream along the way) he goes up one side of me and the down the other, stating I'm petty and being controlling and whatever else. At this point I told him that not only would me and my kids not be doing any family outings with him anymore providing he brings his dog but we will also not be going anywhere with him unless I'm the one driving, which he absolutely hates because I \"don't drive fast enough\" (meaning I go the speed limit, whereas he goes 60+mph). I no longer feel I trust him with me or my children's safety when it comes to driving. He has not spoken to me since and my best friend is saying my fiance is right and that I'm being a controlling AH because it's \"not hurting anything but my feelings\". AITA?\n\nETA: Another commenter told me I should add to the original post regarding how I have spoken to my fiance multiple times regarding the safety issue. I have all but begged him not to do this and this is the first time I have snapped. However, with that said, my children's father died in a vehicle related accident, which makes my anxiety much worse regarding the issue.

Met my now fiance 2 years ago and he has been great but issues sparked up recently in the safety department of things.\n\nHe got a 30-40lb small breed dog last year from his mother for Christmas. That in itself wasn't a deal breaking issue despite none of us wanting a dog. The issue is he refuses to go out with me or the kids anymore without bringing the dog, where he proceeds to drive with her on his lap. If this dog is not in his lap, she starts whining like absolute crazy and he just gives in and let's her sit in his lap. He has to lean backwards just so she isn't touching the steering wheel. There have been multiple times I have told him to stop doing this, because at this point he is putting all of our lives in danger. He will stop for a few weeks or so and then go right back to it. \n\nSo yesterday I absolutely had enough. I begged him to keep the dog home but he refused because he wanted to stop off at the park and let the kids and the dog run off energy. On the way home (like 6 miles from home) the dog climbs on his lap. He allows it. I immediately say that he needs to stop. He tells me I'm overthinking and need to live a little, that he isn't hurting anyone and that he's \"got this\". At one point snapping and saying \"we are almost fucking home, it's literally not a big deal\". So I told him to pull over and ended up taking me and my children out of the car to walk the rest of the way (at this point it was only roughly 2 miles away). He stops a few times and tells us to get back in and I refused because that dog was still on his lap. \n\nWhen we get home (after stopping with my kids for ice cream along the way) he goes up one side of me and the down the other, stating I'm petty and being controlling and whatever else. At this point I told him that not only would me and my kids not be doing any family outings with him anymore providing he brings his dog but we will also not be going anywhere with him unless I'm the one driving. I no longer feel I trust him with me or my children's safety when it comes to driving. He has not spoken to me since and my best friend is saying my fiance is right and that I'm being a controlling AH because it's \"not hurting anything but my feelings\".

My dogs ride in crates when they're too little for a seatbelt, and then seatbelts once they're a bit older.\n\nBTW, as a PSA, dogs, like little kids, should ride in the backseat whether wearing a seatbelt or in a crate, because they can be seriously injured/killed by the airbag in the front passenger seat in the event of an accident.", "Yeah like driving your car with your dog in your lap was a great life\u2026", "Oh no, OP is trying to live a bit more than little. Like maybe grow old enough to be 50? That'd be nice. Then she can die in a car accident. /s", "In the event of a crash, the dog will become a projectile. Dogs should be restrained in a car, just like children and bags and anything that may fly around.", "This, there is nothing I hate more than people who drive recklessly with others in the car. If you wanna drive with your dog in your lap when you're alone that's on you. This isn't one of those situations where you can let the worst happen and go \"see? Told you\" because you could all be dead. \n\nAnd what's worse is she has trauma related to a car crash! Ridiculous man", "Five lives, actually! OP and her kids, but also the dog. If the airbag goes off with that dog in his lap, its pretty likely to kill the dog.", "... and everyone on the road, especially pedestrians and cyclists.", "So true! Five, if you count the darn dog.", "Shit, I was taking my relatively small cat to the vet, she broke out of her cage and went immediately for my lap. Highway, no really good spot to pull over and I was close to the exit with the vet with office being very close to the off ramp. \n\nI drove extremely carefully, put on my 4 ways and it was still nerve racking the entire time. I obviously replaced the cage with the sturdiest model I could find. \n\nWhy someone would voluntarily do this is beyond my understanding. That someone would do so knowing their SO's first spouse died in a car wreck is flat out insane", "And when the airbag hits the dog, it will slam the dog backwards into the driver. I cringe every time I see someone posting photos of the dog on their lap.", "This should have thousands of upvotes", "Pretty certain in the UK they made an awareness video about not wearing seatbelts. \n\nIt was a mum driving her kids to school and arguing with them about putting on their belts. She got distracted and rear ended a car. The kid behind her flew into the back of the seat. The kid survived. The mum didn't.", "THIS EXACTLY.  This man, even if he brings other great things into the relationship, shows he cares more about his dog than you or your kids' safety.  Please think about whether this relationship is worth it. NTA.", "Agree. Good for you for drawing this sensible safety boundary for you and your kids, OP. You've compromised enough. Stay alive, and BTW, he's the controlling one. NTA", "Yes!", "This is r/WhyWomenLiveLonger material", "I got re-ended three years ago because a dog crawled into the driver's lap and the driver stomped on the gas.\n\nLike, get a carrier and ignore the whining. Or don't take the dog.", "An elderly man drove up onto the sidewalk right in front of my house and crashed into a speed sign going 35-40mph because his dogs were in his lap. He very easily could have killed someone walking up the street, but thankfully there was no one around.", "A girl from my highschool crashed into a lake for the same thing... \n\nLuckily everyone was fine except for the car.", "Any dog is too big to be in someone\u2019s lap while driving! My dog is 7 lbs and I do not let him in my lap while I\u2019m driving because him blocking my view or climbing up onto my shoulder or resting his head on my arm while I\u2019m holding the steering wheel could cause an accident. I latch him to the seatbelt for short drives and keep him in his kennel for long drives for both of our safety. Yes, he whines, but that\u2019s far preferable to an accident.", "He\u2019s far worse than a nincompoop. Not only is he objectively risking their actual lives, but he is being dismissive of her legitimate concerns, and even insensitive to her past trauma. If my partner\u2019s ex had died in a car accident, and partner found it triggering if I went round corners a bit fast (for example), even if I felt safe, you better believe I\u2019d go round every one like I had a wedding cake unsecured in the back. Let alone not breaking the actual law.", "It doesn't take a mistake, it doesn't take a lapse of judgment. \n\nAll it takes is a technical issue or some other driver zoning out at a bad time and you can't do shit.\nNot to mention dog getting spooked and doing something unexpected.\n\nThat AH is willfully endangering himself, his dog, and anyone else in the car and around it.", "Curious: why haven\u2019t you driven and why do you think you never will? I was raised in a more rural, mountainous area where it\u2019s super odd to meet someone who doesn\u2019t drive. When I went to college, I met more urbanites who didn\u2019t have their licenses, but weren\u2019t against it one day. I\u2019m just curious about why you never have and never will?", "Tbf lol, I have a corgi who\u2019s \u201csmall\u201d (short af), but he weighs 50lbs because he\u2019s really DENSE lol. Built like an absolute log", "Yes, and whether or not that fixes this specific issue, this is NOT a person I'd want to ride in a car with myself, let alone allow my children to ride with. It's not just the dog, it's an overall wreckless attitude towards operating dangerous and very easily lethal machinery\n\nOP, not only are you NTA, you did a great job protecting your kids in this instance. Keep it up and make sure you don't give in to this shit no matter how much he acts like it's a you issue. (Btw I hope he's not using your trauma history to invalidate your very valid safety concern here; if he is let me assure you you're not over reacting)", "I know its autocorrect but I now must know how exactly does anything Chinese?", "This isn't even putting the dog first since the poor puppy is in the least safe position they could be in.", "The only time I ever do this is when driving to the vet and that\u2019s a really short drive and low speed situation and I too have a 16 lb dog. I can\u2019t imagine driving major roads with a bigger dog.", ">30-40 is not a small dog\n\nThat's what I was thinking too. Like, I certainly wouldn't drive around with a bag of flour on my lap, much less a slightly smaller bag that had independent movement. \n\nAlso, this guy is happy to drive with the dog in his lap, but one wrong paw into the groin, and he's doubled over and loses control of the car.", "Yup they have to be properly restrained. I have all sorts of dog seatbelts in my car and house now. I don\u2019t even want to think about my 25kg doodle(s) flying through the air in a collision.", "Or for the dog. They should be restrained or away from the driver for their own safety. \n\nAnd of fucking course he speeds. That poor dog and those poor kids.", "Given that he is so self centered, he should consider 40lbs of meat, crushing his face &/or sternum, because of airbag. Even a \"good\" driver can't dodge if a car crosses over and hits head on. I know from experience, pre-airbags, my seatbelt  saved my life. The seatbelt, seizing up, was extremely painful, much deep bruising and neck abrasions, but I was alive. A 40lb dog in my lap would have been crushed by steering wheel, as the engine block was pushed into the cabin. Then the dog would have crushed my organs, as I would have been crushed between the steering wheel and a 40 lb mass. So, possible internal damage. Same 40 lb dog,  sitting on passenger seat, it would have been a projectile, slammed into glove box area. Very injured or dead dog,  as well as more seriously injured AH driver.", "To add to this, it's also abusive.  That last sentence is what seals the deal.\n\n>However, with that said, my children's father died in a vehicle related accident, which makes my anxiety much worse regarding the issue. My fiance knows this.\n\n100% abusive. He knows that it causes you major distress, but keeps on doing it.  When you actually like someone (and especially when you love someone), you don't continue to do things that upset them or cause them distress.", "This point was prominently stressed when we attended a car seat safety class before our first child was born. An unrestrained animal in the car turns into a heavy projectile in an accident and will likely die and injure a passenger in the process. The thought alone was traumatizing enough that we\u2019ve never once driven without our dogs being properly harnessed in their own seats.", "I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s illegal in the US as well.", "That's a good way to have OP's kids removed if she is in the car, too....", "Seriously. I have a 25-30lb dog and he's way too big to sit in my lap while I'm driving. Wtf", "Imagine in the event of an accident having a 30lb projectile in the car.  Dude is going to be decapitated by dog.", "I'm really confused about the \"30-40lb small dog\". That's about 15-20kg and unless she's extremely overweight, she's a medium sized dog. It's the weight of a border collie.", "He also got the dog without OP agreeing to it. That dog will be living with her (once they marry) for at least 10 years and you just know this asshole will never train it. OP is going to have a shit and pee stained house for the next decade.", "Dude puts up with 3 kids that aren't his. Sounds like a saint to me", "Those crushed bones could easily pierce the driver, or blunt force trauma from the inertia of the dog ramming into his body, killing him as well. He is putting his own life in serious jeopardy.", "You seem to not care about the safety of other motorists and pedestrians, however. Your own enjoyment isn't worth putting ANYONE in danger. You want to do that, go to a track.", "I have tried that. Due to his unhealthy attachment and anxiety that she now has due to his attachment, she won't go near me or the kids 9 times out of 10. Prior to her climbing on my husband's lap I was holding her on mine and she was losing her shit trying to get to him.", "Or they could get a seat belt for the dog. Mine have them and I feel so much safer having them tethered where they don't either become distractions, fall out the window or get severely hurt in a accident. \n\nI shudder to think what would happen if an airbag went off with a dog in such close proximity. A medium sized dog might not be crushed to death but if wouldn't be pretty. I agree NTA and this is absolutely a boundary I would make if myself or children were in the car.", "Her husband died in a car accident, and her dumbass boyfriend knows that and still decides to drive unsafely. \n\nShe is NOT blowing it out of proportion.", "The first part of your post surely explains why it is a reason to get very upset with him so I'm confused as to how you acknowledge this is super dangerous  for the people and unfair to the dog but yet not a reason for her to get upset? I don't quite understand that. This guy sounds extremely controlling (he won't let her drive) and his response to her prioritising the safety of the children is to get abusive - to me this is definitely a reason not to move forward with a marriage.", "The \"right\" choice? lol, two miles isn't very far, a healthy walk, and they even stopped for ice cream.", "I did too. Driving was one of the ways my father enacted abuse. I don't drive myself because people like my father could be in the cars around me on the road. Oh my god I've just put this together in my head while writing. I used to tell people I don't drive because my father was a terrible driver. It was deliberate. He used it to frighten and intimidate us.", "I couldn't agree more. It must have been awful for the kids having to listen to the adults fightning and then suddenly being forced out of the car and made to walk home. And this will only be the first of many dangerous situations that the fianc\u00e8e will put her and her kids in if she dosen't leave him.", "The dog is family up and until it\u2019s endangering the children. Then it\u2019s a danger and so is her partner.", "Dogs in card are supposed to be in a secured crate or have a doggy seat belt leash. It is the responsibility of the dog owner to provide a safe environment for their dog, and the responsibility of the driver to provide a safe environment for passengers. Neither of which is OP.

So yeah, OP's fiance is very much endangering everyone in the car including the dog.", "yeah there is no way this is a good idea.", "Makes sense \ud83d\ude02\n\nDoes your fianc\u00e9 love this dog? If he does, he should realize that dogs should be in a crate and/or seatbelt-harness as well. If he\u2019s in a crash, that dog is dead (including if OTHER drives are bad; it\u2019s nothing to do with his own driving \u201cskills\u201d). \n\nI\u2019m frustrated for you OP. NTA. I hope he can see some sense. Definitely stick to your guns on this one. Don\u2019t let up\n\nETA: also those breeds are both incredibly smart and definitely trainable\u2014 he should be working on that", "Either way, adding a distraction while driving is dangerous, and it's not \"blowing it out of proportion\" to refuse to ride with an unsafe driver.", "What if, instead of \"dog on his lap\" while \"driving 60+mph\", she had said he was texting on his phone, or drinking a beer, riding someones ass or break checking people? Would you still say she was blowing it out of proportion? It doesn't matter what the distraction is, driving while distracted causes accidents. It shouldn't matter that her husband died in a car accident to say she was right to get her children out of an unsafe environment. Op is NTA", "Even without that context he was the asshole, massively and you saying she blew it out of proportion is just an ignorant statement", "A vet once told me to put a grape in a jar, close the lid, and shake the jar really hard. What happens to the grape is what happens to an unrestrained pet in a car accident.", "I fully agree. One of my small dogs had serious car anxiety, but he had to sit in his car seat, strapped in for the trip on blankets and with toys. My other dog adores car rides and he still wears his harness and seat belt because it's for his safety. A safe, alive dog is much better than a dangerous accident waiting to happen.", "> dogs do not get to make their own decisions regarding their safety.\n\nThis part!", "I even put a seatbelt around my cat's carriers when I can (one pees in the car and I can't put him on the seat, but he goes in the floorboards in his carrier). I don't want to take any chances", "As a short person who scoots the seat way up, I\u2019m suddenly very concerned for myself.", "Yes, exactly. When I wrote that comment, I was actually thinking of a late relative of mine who used to let her dog eat people food as much as he wanted, even when it contained ingredients that were actively toxic to dogs, like chocolate. When we visitors would object, she'd wave us off and defend her choices by talking about how he was a good boy who deserved a nice treat.\n\nThe dog was horrifically obese and in horrible health. I never understood why she couldn't see that her \"good boy\" deserved a good, healthy life with a human caretaker who cared about his well being and happiness.", "If the dog doesn\u2019t die from the seat belt, the burns and chemicals from the airbag will be very painful. One tore up my arm years ago and I still have scars", "Wow, I didn't think about airbags. Would kill of severely injure poor dog. Driver injured also!", "Plus it's a 40lbs projectile.  Could easily kill a person while flying around.", "One of the most horrible things I have ever seen was an accident on the Las Angeles freeway where a car accident shot the dog partway through the windshield. \n\nI still have nightmares about it sometimes when I'm stressed. \n\nI used to have my dogs sit in the backseat, but didn't attach them to anything because I worried the collar could strangle them in an accident if it was attached. Now, any animal I transport is harnessed and attached by a seatbelt with a good crash rating. I actually carry a box of old harnesses in different sizes for lost pets I might pick up and ferry home or to the vet to scan for a chip.", "Damn \ud83d\ude33", "OMG my puppy will come RUNNING LIKE A LUNATIC to me when he is a Good Boy and I tell him and call his name. He is beyond THRILLED to get love and attention and more love and more attention at any point.  I have to be very careful with his weight because he is a mastiff and if they gain weight too fast as puppies, it can cause horrific joint problems. But even my BMC/GSD gets love and attention and lots of playing for being good. They don't need treats too much, just super duper amounts of love.", "The what from the what now??", "When airbags are deployed sometimes they burst and chemicals come out and can burn any exposed skin. It\u2019s very unpleasant"]}
