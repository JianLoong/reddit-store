He's living rent-free with our parents (54F and 56M), doesn't contribute to any expenses like groceries or internet, has no idea how much things cost and treats the money he wins like pocket money instead, funding his hobbies and outings with friends. He has no plans of improving his situation, doesn't want to go back to school or try his hand at something else than what he currently does. He also doesn't have a partner (and never has), and hasn't expressed any interest in having children. Despite all this, we are very close as he confides in me about essentially everything, we enjoy a lot of the same things and hang out often.\n\nMy best friend (29F) \"Ella\" on the other hand is engaged to her long-term boyfriend and is pregnant with their first child. They own a house and both work in healthcare, ensuring financial stability. I've known Ella since high school and we stayed closed despite her moving to a different city, she was my MOH at our wedding two years ago and I'm gonna be hers in their upcoming wedding. They have an active lifestyle, know how to properly manage money, have a great support system, and I know they'd love and take care of our children like they were theirs. They also know my parents and brother and they would do what it takes to maintain the connection with them.\n\nWhen we asked them if they'd be willing to be in our will as legal guardians, they were moved and said yes, of course. However, they did mention they were surprised I didn't consider my brother before them, to which I replied that while I would absolutely love for Eric to be in my kids' lives, I only see him being a uncle and not a parent. \n\nI'm guessing I'll have to break the news to my family eventually so it's not a complete surprise if anything happens, and I worry Eric and my parents won't take it well, as they're very family-centered and feel like you should always come to family first for help.

Why open a can of worms for something that likely will not happen, and certainly isn't a possibility yet since you aren't even pregnant.\n\n--->And children aren't property, even if you \"name\" a guardian there is no legal mandate to force that person to take your kids.  So what's in the will is more your *desire* for a minor child's care in the event of a tragic situation.

It was appropriate. At the time, I was on a personal journey; I continent hopped and was broke; I sofa surfed my way through EU ( my eldest has done the same), even going down to Morocco - a bold move for a 25 yo woman. I was single after leaving a very abusive relationship, and needed to find me.\n\nYou are so NTA for this. You are doing right by your children.\n\nI hope your brother finds peace. I did.\n\nEdit to add: Perhaps, as you two are so close, you could tell Eric in private, before announcing it.", "Why do you have to bring this up to your family?

It\u2019s no one\u2019s business until then.\n\nNTA", "INFO: Why do you feel you need to announce it?\n\nLook, this is a worst case scenario.  Good parents make sure to account for these possibilities but the chances of you and your spouse dying are not high.  Why do you need to tell your family anything about guardianship?  If someone asks, you can be honest but there\u2019s no reason to volunteer this info.", "You WNBTA for you and your wife naming Ella as the guardian of your child/ren and y\u2019all are wise in getting your will and guardianship papers in order and drawn as soon as possible out of an abundance of caution. Also smart of y\u2019all to ask Ella and her fianc\u00e9 whether they would agree to serve in this role. Did you get a read on Ella\u2019s surprise you didn't ask your brother before them comment? I recommend you privately probe a little more on that to see if that comment was partly because she felt awkward/overwhelmed or because she was concerned about and wanted to make sure there wouldn\u2019t be drama or a legal battle if she and her soon-to-be husband were named guardian/s rather than your brother especially knowing how close y\u2019all are.\n\nBut is Ella knows your brother well or you\u2019ve confided to her over the years the specifics of his not exactly adulting gifts, I wouldn\u2019t have expected her to question why you hadn\u2019t named or asked your brother.\n\nWhen you \u201creplied that while I would absolutely love for Eric to be in my kids' lives, I only see him being a uncle and not a parent,\u201d it doesn\u2019t sound like Ella actually has much knowledge of the details of what you posted here. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to \u201ctrash\u201d your brother, but it\u2019s important that you confide more in Ella about his specific issues that concern you so that she can be aware should the guardianship be triggered and as Ella evaluates visitations and the possibility or temporary guardianship of your child/ren in the future. Eric might want to take the kids on a family vacation for instance or Ella and her husband may plan an anniversary trip abroad for a couple weeks and Eric offer to be responsible for your child/ren and possibly also Ella\u2019s while she and her husband are away. Or Ella or her husband or one of their kids may have a medical emergency and she may want or need him to care for your child/ren temporarily or for an extended time period (such as someone having to leave town and have intensive side effects and hospitalizations for cancer treatment or any thousands of reasons). Ella needs to know what to keep/stay on the lookout for and specifically what your concerns are with reference to your brother having temporary unsupervised possession/visitation periods or temporary or alternate guardianship etc.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to consider alternates somewhat like a line of succession and also discuss with your lawyer/s whether you feel like you need to list Eric as a person who is specifically excluded as serving as guardian. Doing that may or may not be a good idea as it\u2019s always possible that Eric will change and \u201cgrown up\u201d over time to be much more independent, responsible, and may find and maintain a solid partner or spouse and have kids himself.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that something could happen that results in Ella and/or her husband no longer being a placement that\u2019s in the best interests of your child/ren for, again, so many different reasons. \n\nDo you feel that anyone in your wife\u2019s family would be good candidates to be in the line of succession so to speak to serve as alternates? It\u2019s great that y\u2019all are thinking about and working through all this on the front end. So many parents make no provisions for their children and put no specifications in their will, if they even have one, leaving it all up to the system or the court to sort out without the benefit of indicators of family or friend dynamics or what the parent/s would have wanted for their kid.\n\nLastly, I don\u2019t know how things work in your jurisdiction, but it\u2019s often recommended to avoid naming the same people to control your child/ren\u2019s guardianship as the people who get named to control your child/ren\u2019s inheritance and/or finances from the estate.\n\nFor sure it sound like you definitely would want someone else handling the money out of an abundance of caution should it turn out that Eric winds up with temporary or permanent guardianship of your child/ren, but no one can predict the future so it\u2019s a safe bet to have a trust and a separate trustee for the money to support your child/ren\u2019s health and welfare, care, comfort, education, recreation, transportation, supplemental supervision, enrichment, upbringing, etc. Many folks will choose to set up a trust with a bank and name the bank as the trustee in the absence of a very responsible ethical and stable relative, but definitely do your research on the bank\u2019s reputation with overseeing and administering trusts of the type you\u2019ll need for guardianship of minor child/ren as not all are created equal plus you don\u2019t want to create nightmares for Ella or whoever serves as guardian trying to access funds to support your child/ren. You want a good gatekeeper or security screener in this type of role, not an AH, roadblock, or micromanagy obstructionist as that sort of undermines the goal of having someone oversee and help administer and safeguard the money while facilitating access for appropriate and reasonable use.\n\nIn a best case scenerio, this actually benefits the guardians and the ward as it\u2019s one less major thing for them to try to keep track of and manage, so they can instead focus on what you sought them out for\u2014 which is to care for and raise your child/ren on your behalf should you and your wife ever become unable to.\n\nGood luck to you and your wife, OP!", "NTA you do what's best for your kid", "NTA\n\nGuardianship isn't just an honour - it's a massive responsibility.
