He's living rent-free with our parents (54F and 56M), doesn't contribute to any expenses like groceries or internet, has no idea how much things cost and treats the money he wins like pocket money instead, funding his hobbies and outings with friends. He has no plans of improving his situation, doesn't want to go back to school or try his hand at something else than what he currently does. He also doesn't have a partner (and never has), and hasn't expressed any interest in having children. Despite all this, we are very close as he confides in me about essentially everything, we enjoy a lot of the same things and hang out often.\n\nMy best friend (29F) \"Ella\" on the other hand is engaged to her long-term boyfriend and is pregnant with their first child. They own a house and both work in healthcare, ensuring financial stability. I've known Ella since high school and we stayed closed despite her moving to a different city, she was my MOH at our wedding two years ago and I'm gonna be hers in their upcoming wedding. They have an active lifestyle, know how to properly manage money, have a great support system, and I know they'd love and take care of our children like they were theirs. They also know my parents and brother and they would do what it takes to maintain the connection with them.\n\nWhen we asked them if they'd be willing to be in our will as legal guardians, they were moved and said yes, of course. However, they did mention they were surprised I didn't consider my brother before them, to which I replied that while I would absolutely love for Eric to be in my kids' lives, I only see him being a uncle and not a parent. \n\nI'm guessing I'll have to break the news to my family eventually so it's not a complete surprise if anything happens, and I worry Eric and my parents won't take it well, as they're very family-centered and feel like you should always come to family first for help.

Why open a can of worms for something that likely will not happen, and certainly isn't a possibility yet since you aren't even pregnant.\n\n--->And children aren't property, even if you \"name\" a guardian there is no legal mandate to force that person to take your kids.

At the time, I was on a personal journey; I continent hopped and was broke; I sofa surfed my way through EU ( my eldest has done the same), even going down to Morocco - a bold move for a 25 yo woman. I was single after leaving a very abusive relationship, and needed to find me.\n\nYou are so NTA for this. You are doing right by your children.\n\nI hope your brother finds peace. I did.\n\nEdit to add: Perhaps, as you two are so close, you could tell Eric in private, before announcing it.", "Why do you have to bring this up to your family?

Good parents make sure to account for these possibilities but the chances of you and your spouse dying are not high.  Why do you need to tell your family anything about guardianship?  If someone asks, you can be honest but there\u2019s no reason to volunteer this info.", "You WNBTA for you and your wife naming Ella as the guardian of your child/ren and y\u2019all are wise in getting your will and guardianship papers in order and drawn as soon as possible out of an abundance of caution. Also smart of y\u2019all to ask Ella and her fianc\u00e9 whether they would agree to serve in this role. Did you get a read on Ella\u2019s surprise you didn't ask your brother before them comment? I recommend you privately probe a little more on that to see if that comment was partly because she felt awkward/overwhelmed or because she was concerned about and wanted to make sure there wouldn\u2019t be drama or a legal battle if she and her soon-to-be husband were named guardian/s rather than your brother especially knowing how close y\u2019all are.\n\nBut is Ella knows your brother well or you\u2019ve confided to her over the years the specifics of his not exactly adulting gifts, I wouldn\u2019t have expected her to question why you hadn\u2019t named or asked your brother.\n\nWhen you \u201creplied that while I would absolutely love for Eric to be in my kids' lives, I only see him being a uncle and not a parent,\u201d it doesn\u2019t sound like Ella actually has much knowledge of the details of what you posted here. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to \u201ctrash\u201d your brother, but it\u2019s important that you confide more in Ella about his specific issues that concern you so that she can be aware should the guardianship be triggered and as Ella evaluates visitations and the possibility or temporary guardianship of your child/ren in the future. Eric might want to take the kids on a family vacation for instance or Ella and her husband may plan an anniversary trip abroad for a couple weeks and Eric offer to be responsible for your child/ren and possibly also Ella\u2019s while she and her husband are away. Or Ella or her husband or one of their kids may have a medical emergency and she may want or need him to care for your child/ren temporarily or for an extended time period (such as someone having to leave town and have intensive side effects and hospitalizations for cancer treatment or any thousands of reasons). Ella needs to know what to keep/stay on the lookout for and specifically what your concerns are with reference to your brother having temporary unsupervised possession/visitation periods or temporary or alternate guardianship etc.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to consider alternates somewhat like a line of succession and also discuss with your lawyer/s whether you feel like you need to list Eric as a person who is specifically excluded as serving as guardian. Doing that may or may not be a good idea as it\u2019s always possible that Eric will change and \u201cgrown up\u201d over time to be much more independent, responsible, and may find and maintain a solid partner or spouse and have kids himself.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that something could happen that results in Ella and/or her husband no longer being a placement that\u2019s in the best interests of your child/ren for, again, so many different reasons. \n\nDo you feel that anyone in your wife\u2019s family would be good candidates to be in the line of succession so to speak to serve as alternates? It\u2019s great that y\u2019all are thinking about and working through all this on the front end. So many parents make no provisions for their children and put no specifications in their will, if they even have one, leaving it all up to the system or the court to sort out without the benefit of indicators of family or friend dynamics or what the parent/s would have wanted for their kid.\n\nLastly, I don\u2019t know how things work in your jurisdiction, but it\u2019s often recommended to avoid naming the same people to control your child/ren\u2019s guardianship as the people who get named to control your child/ren\u2019s inheritance and/or finances from the estate.\n\nFor sure it sound like you definitely would want someone else handling the money out of an abundance of caution should it turn out that Eric winds up with temporary or permanent guardianship of your child/ren, but no one can predict the future so it\u2019s a safe bet to have a trust and a separate trustee for the money to support your child/ren\u2019s health and welfare, care, comfort, education, recreation, transportation, supplemental supervision, enrichment, upbringing, etc. Many folks will choose to set up a trust with a bank and name the bank as the trustee in the absence of a very responsible ethical and stable relative, but definitely do your research on the bank\u2019s reputation with overseeing and administering trusts of the type you\u2019ll need for guardianship of minor child/ren as not all are created equal plus you don\u2019t want to create nightmares for Ella or whoever serves as guardian trying to access funds to support your child/ren. You want a good gatekeeper or security screener in this type of role, not an AH, roadblock, or micromanagy obstructionist as that sort of undermines the goal of having someone oversee and help administer and safeguard the money while facilitating access for appropriate and reasonable use.\n\nIn a best case scenerio, this actually benefits the guardians and the ward as it\u2019s one less major thing for them to try to keep track of and manage, so they can instead focus on what you sought them out for\u2014 which is to care for and raise your child/ren on your behalf should you and your wife ever become unable to.\n\nGood luck to you and your wife, OP!", "NTA you do what's best for your kid", "NTA\n\nGuardianship isn't just an honour - it's a massive responsibility.

They will be hurt but honestly they will probably get over it.", "We did similar with my kids and choose my brother in case anything happened. He lived away from the rest of my family but was far more mature and by far the more stable. My oldest sister basically put her kids into my ageing parents hands at birth and only brought them out as her kids as a token to show off once or so a year. My parents loved them but they didn\u2019t have the type of bond they had with my kids purely as they were my kids grandparents only. They were forced to raise a number of kids at an age when their health was already deteriorating and were retired, they never got any rest or a life just for themselves. When ever we visited them we still took care of our own kids. So they only ever had fun with my kids. I could see the difference and how happy they were to see my kids verses sis\u2019s. It always made me feel sorry for my nieces and nephews. They had a crap mum and their grandparents relationship with them was worn thin because of their mum.   \nMy sis is a bad person point blank and I know she would insist on being their parent as she has kids herself. The thing is it would all be for outward show, and to try and get her hands on their home and any inheritance, my kids would have a hell of a life. As her long term enablers if my parents had my kids they\u2019d let sis do what she want and abuse them as she wants. If she insisted she be their new guardian my parents would do the paperwork to pretend they were and then hand my kids over to sis who would never be allowed officially.   \nNo one has ever even considered my brother and that he is who we named. Firstly he\u2019s a man (to them that makes a reason), secondly he lives his own life and hardly sees us. So I left them with that delusion and haven\u2019t once named anyone their guardians to their faces. If anything happens then it\u2019s in writing but before that it may never happen.   \nMy brother is a good person and my kids love him far more than any other of my family. As toxic shows even to kids.\n\n The truth is if you pass away your family is always going to be upset. Why cause the upset before time and have years of tension. If I didn\u2019t have my brother then I would definitely make sure no one else in my family was named and turn to friends instead. It\u2019s more of a thing now as we lost my husband two years ago. Even though my kids are older I know my brother will still guide and support them.", "NTA, being a parent means that your child(ren) comes first, wife second, then everyone else, if you can accomodate them. You're need to do what's best for the kid.\n\nI have 2 younger siblings. My dad has a sister, and my mom has 4 siblings, yet when we were young, our parents asked a family friend, a married couple, to take guardianship if anything happened. My aunt was a single mom to our cousin who was already relying heavily on our grandparents for childcare. My mom's siblings all had several kids of their own, small houses, different parenting views, etc. The couple's kids were already older teens, going to college, etc. \n\nMy parents chose the people who they believed were able to care and provide for us best and teach us the values that they believed in. If your brother can't provide the life you want for your kids, then that's all that matters. Maybe in 5 or 10 years, he'll have matured, and you can update your will if that happens. Bur whether your parents disagree or not is entirely irrelevant, it's not their decision.\n\nI agree with others that you're not obligated to tell them your plan, especially if it's going to create drama with your parents over a hypothetical thats unlikely to happen. If you feel the need, though, you could write a letter to them for your lawyer/executor to give them if necessary to explain your reasons and wishes for your kids.", "Nothing is set in stone. At this moment in time, your brother is in no state to be taking care of your imaginary child. That may change over time. If so, you can revisit this part of your wills.", "NTA\nNo one likes to talk about \u201cwhat if\u201d, but if it comes to pass, having a plan in place makes life easier for those who have to carry on when you are gone.  \n\nIt seems a little presumptuous to assign guardians before even having kids, but there\u2019s no danger in assessing their willingness to take that on in advance.\n\nYou should review wills and beneficiaries regularly anyways.  In a few years time, your BIL might settle into a more responsible career & life; you may fall apart from existing friends, you could have triplets & friends might have to decline guardianship due to other responsibilities.", "We have friends as backup guardians rather than family.  It's not unusual.  But also, this is hopefully something that would never have to be put in place.  This is an oh shit scenario.  Not to say that doesn't happen, (tragically) but doing what you think is best for your future child is never being an asshole", "YWNBTA.\n\nMy kids are going to my husband\u2019s best friend and his wife if something happens to us. Our siblings are either terrible parenting matches or train wrecks, and neither of our moms are in any physical state (and my mom no financial state) to take care of teens full time. You simply must choose people who will be good guardians\u2014and that is not always family. It\u2019s a harsh fact, but kids deserve appropriate guardians.", "Until you actually have a kid, I highly suggest that you keep this between you & your spouse.  It will raise up so much turmoil that you can't even imagine for absolutely no good reason.  \n\n\nIn fact, it's best to just keep quiet on the topic even after kids come along.  The chances of both you and your husband dying at the same time without your kids along is very low (despite TV & Disney stories).   Until disaster hits, your child(ren)s welfare just won't be guaranteed.   People's lives change. Your friend & you might be across the country or she might have too many obligations of her own.  \n\nNothing is guaranteed,  especially in guardianship cases.\n\nIf it helps to understand,  my husband & I had these \"what-if\" conversations about the welfare of our child if something happened to either or both of us.   We live with an elderly parent, who by absolutely no means, would be able to raise our kid. We're each essentially \"only\" children & have aged parents. His are 3k miles away. \n\n There was never any good answers of who could do it, even with our good friends.  Thankfully, our child is a legal adult now, so no more worries on that front. Time passed & it became unimportant.  No feathers were ruffled.\n\nNAH", "NAH you haven\u2019t told them so there is no issue yet, I would hold off on telling them until you actually have a child personally\u2026but we did the same.\n\nMy sister is early in her career and going back to school, also works 12 hour shifts, so not a great place to send a young child. \n\nMy sister in law lives 6 hours away and is also early in her career with a one bedroom apartment.\n\nMy best friends who have a child 8 months older then ours was selected to go in our will as our first choice for guardian. We also made it clear that if we got past the age where long work shifts would be a problem, then we could reevaluate later on.", "NTA. You are your child's last line of defense against a shitty childhood. You have a lifetime of examples as to why your brother is not fit for the task. You owe it to your child to make the best decision you can with the information available to you.", "As someone who watched my cousin die and his wealthy kind friends didn\u2019t get to keep the child because the nasty in laws fought dirty, definitely NTA. choose the person who will love and provide for your kid the best if you pass away. A 24 year old is probably not the right choice anyway", "Nta I hope your brother appreciates that he wouldn\u2019t be ready for a surprise kid while your friend will be. \n\nAlso, the world is trash and unfortunately let\u2019s say he gets a partner if they are a woman they might go with the gender norms and that person could be the primary parent taking care of your kid. That\u2019s a whole other variable that you can\u2019t guess. \nYou\u2019ve met Ella\u2019s partner. \n\nI hope they are rational about this", "First and foremost, you don't have to say anything to anyone. The paperwork only come into action if something happens to you and your partner. Second, as the child's parent/mother, you owe nothing in terms of caregiving decisions to anyone. Further still, it does not sound like your brother is emotionally or psychologically capable of handling such a responsibility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're definitely not the asshole.", "NTA, and you actually don't have to tell anyone anything.  Just make sure your will can't be argued (consult a lawyer for this) and then you're done.", "NTA.
