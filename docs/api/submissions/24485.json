My son told me to post on here because quite there is a rift in our household right now. \n\nHere are the key details you should know. My son (23) has always worked very hard and earlier this year purchased a GMC for 30K. This was a big deal to him because before that he was still driving the old Chrysler he got after his grandma passed away. \n\nSecond key detail is that my wife and I have been saving for our kids\u2019 college when they were young. My son has graduated college and that money has mostly been used up. I think it\u2019s about 50K that each of them received or will receive in the case of my daughter who is 16. \n\nMy son went out of town last weekend to visit friends. That is when this incident went down. Sometime after my wife and I fell asleep on Friday night, my daughter snuck out at night and took his car. My wife and I got a call from the police at close to 3 AM telling us that my daughter and 3 friends were in custody after they had ran the car up a curb, knocking down a street sign and colliding with a tree. They were speeding recklessly, and to top it all off, my daughter wasn\u2019t even driving but they all had been drinking too. Car is totaled.  Since she wasn\u2019t the driver she avoided the DUI but was charged with underage drinking as well as a curfew violation. \n\nI\u2019m going to skip the part where we picked her up from the police station and conversations because it\u2019s not relevant. when my son arrived home he was crushed. So without thinking anything of it, I told my son to go buy a new one and I will be transferring the money from his sisters college fund so he can buy a new one.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t able to find the same great deal on the same year with similar mileage. He used almost 40K to get a 2022 model And I was fine with it. This left his sisters fund with about 15K left. It is her dream to go to a big school in the south, which now seems like a pipe dream unless she takes out big loans. \n\nNaturally, she\u2019s been in hysterics about the college fund and thinking I\u2019m going too hard. She currently hates me, her mom (who is on my side) and brother for spending the money when \u201che could have gotten a cheaper car\u201d. \n\nLikely, she will need to go a cheaper school. Most likely go to community college for 2 years first too to save money. This broke her because she has been set on the particular school since she was in middle school (she has a lot of clothes and even bed sheets of her dream school) so I understand this is tough on her. \n\nIMO she\u2019s lucky to be alive after this stunt, so having her college plans change is a small price to pay imo. My sister and some others are very upset with my wife, son and I. Saying that it sucks, but college is more important than the car. \n\nThe car is bought, the money is spent, the situation is more or less over. So am I an asshole for this? My daughter is currently spouting the \u201cI\u2019m moving out at 18 and never talking to you again\u201d crap but her mom and I think that will blow over.\n\nEdit: we will make up the extra money taken for sons new car. We had to spend that because what he was looking for was hard to find, but by the time she goes to college we will have made up that extra money and I will make that promise to her.", "created_utc": 1691858831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15p9d9x/aita_for_giving_my_son_my_daughters_college_money/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or even as an approved driver? Insurance should have covered some of it.", "ESH. You and your wife suck for letting your son have more than 30k of the money. Your son sucks for taking the extra 10k. Your daughter sucks for acting like she didn't do anything that bad. She stole a car, she was drinking underage, she let someone else who was also drinking drive the car and total it. Yes, she's lucky to be alive but she's also lucky they didn't kill someone else and that your son didn't call the cops.", "NTA.", "You are THA for over reaching the scope of the issue. Imposing a financial penalty is bad, but ending better college choices is horrific. Now you showed lifetime favoritism.", "So your daughter acted stupid, and rather than making her get a job so she could pay her brother back, y'all punish her by crushing her life-long dreams? \n\nI doubt this is going to blow over as easily as you seem to think. ESH is my judgement. No, your daughter wasn't in the right for doing what she and her friends did, but you and your wife could have found another way to punish her rather than wiping out her college fund. And her brother could, in fact, have found a cheaper car.", "Honestly, this is a pretty lenient punishment all things considered. She can still go to college, she just can\u2019t afford her dream school without taking out loans. That\u2019s hardly throwing out her whole future. \n\nOf course, the brother could have been made whole by insurance if he\u2019d have reported the truck as stolen (which it was). A grand theft auto charge would do a whole lot more to ruin her future though. That kind of thing could follow her for the rest of her life.", "ESH. \nYou daughter screwed up, that's no question and should be punished. But should you take away her college dream and possibly chances to get a good job later on to make a point?\n\nYour son could've taken 30k only. I mean, that's what his car costed him. If he wanted smth better it was on him to add the bucks.\n\nYou and your wife should've weighed all the options. Right now you are pretty much possibly taking away your daughter's future. Ruining her dream for sure. And in all honesty, the way you describe your son vs your daughter, it's clear who is the golden child.\n\nI would give 30k to your son as a compensation. Have your daughter start her dream college with 25k for the first year or so and make a plan to help her with loans, for example. May be, even lend her the money with her paying you in parts by having a part time job.\n\nInstead, you gave your golden child a better car and left you 16 year old to fend for herself.", ">\u201che could have gotten a cheaper car\u201d.\n\nShe could've not stolen his car and ruined it, then none of this would be happening. She should also realize that crap like this can cause her to be rejected from many colleges, including her dream school. Your daughter appears to have missed out on a lot of lessons in personal responsibility and generally being a good person. If I were you, I'd be deeply concerned about the type of person she's going to be in her adult life.\n\nUltimately, she created this situation and it's fair to require her to rectify it. NTA.", "Nta and op make daughter get a job to replace some of it\nWhich \nWhy should brother suffer \nThat dui may cause her college and job issues", "NTA", "NTA, ALTHOUGH im not saying I support your choice, its true that your daughter screwed up, big time, and destroyed something that your son had worked his ass off to buy, and i think that she should be punished in some way, BUT i also think that education is much more important than a car, maybe you could find a middle ground between covering the car expenses without jeopardizing your daughter's education so much, its definitelty a very complex situation but after all she's just a teen and doesnt deserve to have his whole future ruined even tho she is COMPLETELY at fault.\nSo sorry for your son tho, I hope he gets his car back.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that the cost to replace his car was higher isn't your son's fault. She broke it, she has to replace it. Better she learn now than when she's an adult facing worse consequences.", "NTA, take the rest of the fund and spend it in something. She will leaving and goin nc anyways...", "Honestly, by the title, I was going to say y a h... but reading the story NTA\n\nShe made a decision to steal the car, drink, and give the keys to another drunk teenager. She needs to be held accountable for damages. \n\nInsurance could have helped a lot... there's not many things that are more important than health and car insurance for avoiding bankruptcy. Perhaps that is yours and your son's lesson too. \n\nBut she caused damage, she needs to pay for it.\n\nEdit. Just for info, what about the driver? Was he/she accountable for any damage payment? You can always try to recoup something.", "YTA. Your daughter screwed up big time but denying her a college education because of it was a horrendous move.\n\nYou saved for years so that she'd have a chance at a good education. Now that's off the table all so your son, who already got his college education, can get a new car. My god.", "She got off easy. She could have been charged with grand theft. Let that sink in. NTA", " NTA but its definitely a situation that sucks all around.\n\nYour daughters an ah for stealing the car and sneaking out for a joyride- I\u2019m glad she\u2019s safe and doesn\u2019t have a dui. But she\u2019s also 16 and I would say most 16 year olds are ahs. When I was 16 I was the god damn devil! Seriously my parents deserve sainthood for putting up with my crap and always being supportive even when I was a full fledged brat!!\n\nThat being said\u2026.Everyone in this situation sucks.\n\nYes your daughter is lucky to be alive and she absolutely deserves to suffer some consequences. At the same time she\u2019s 16 years old and teenagers make dumb and reckless decisions. Your son did not need a 40k car if he couldn\u2019t find the same great deal. This is her college dreams and this is her motivation to do well in high school so she can attend her dream school. Don\u2019t take away her dreams 2 years down the line for something she did at 16.  \n\nBut you already have your son the money it\u2019s spent and gone. It\u2019s not coming back. There\u2019s no use crying over spilt milk. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s a middle ground\u2026.\n\nPerhaps you can help her save and learn the value of working. She needs to understand that her actions have consequences and how truly unfair this situation was to your son as well. Help her find part time work so she can start putting money back into her own college account. Perhaps help her start researching financial aid options and scholarship programs now when she\u2019s 16 so she can have a strong financial plan when she\u2019s 18 for attending her dream school. There\u2019s a lot of small scholarship programs given out by corporations. 500$ here 1000$ there- she might be surprised at how much she can earn through these programs. Start looking up loan options. Perhaps if she graduates college with a certain gpa and no trouble offer to help her pay some of the loan options after college (if you are able to do so). If there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way and she can achieve her goals but unfortunately it\u2019s just going to be harder to do so. But making a plan and doing the research now can help her a lot in the long run. Also look at in state schools too there are a lot of great universities in your own state that will be cheaper and more realistic. 18 year olds don\u2019t need to go out of state to university it\u2019s better for them to have a family support system near by anyways.", "I believe your daughter should get a job. Full time in the summer and part-time during the school year.\nShe should pay the replacement cost of the vehicle. This is not the value of a brand new vehicle. It should be a simular valued car to what was destroyed.", "NTA - she learned a huge lesson with fuck around and find out. She can still go to college with student loans, so her future is not in jeopardy. She\u2019s lucky that all she lost was money as opposed to her life or a potential felony.\n\nSome will argue about the extra 10k. Seems like it was replacement value not paid value", "NTA your daughter stole her brothers car and was drinking with her friends and wrecked it , I feel that the other teen driving should be held responsible for it also & should have to pay 1/2 the cost of the new car I would talk to the other teens parents and tell them they are half responsible & they as such they need to pay or else you\u2019ll take them To court", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter took the car, got drunk with her friends, and totalled the car. Even if she wasn't the one driving it was her responsibility to at least bring it back intact \n\nThis is a good lesson that actions have consequence. Have her take out student loans or go to a community college for a couple years.", "YTA. She wrecked his truck. A fair punishment is to buy a truck of equal value NOT him carte blanche to buy whatever tf he wants. The hell?", "The only ones in the very very wrong here are your daughter and her friends. I think she got off very lightly, no-one's dead and it's not as if she has no chance of further education.", "Sooo, let me see if I got this straight:\n\n1. She stole a car (grand theft auto).\n2. She managed to total the car she'd stolen without even driving it.\n3. She was drinking (dui if she'd been behind the wheel)\n\nSo far so good? Then tell her this:\n\nThere has to be consequences for something this serious. It can't be brushed off as \"youthful hi-jinx\" or something. They could very well have killed someone, does she even realise that? \n\nThat the entire thing came out of her college fund is because I'm guessing any insurance doesn't cover an issue where a familymember (who isn't ON that insurance) steals the car and then for whatever reason ends up in a wreck.\n\nNo, this is appropriate to me. She did something awful, full well knowing they were joyriding in someone elses property and then destroyed it. It's for her to make right.\n\nI'd tell her that you will continue to add to her collegefund, but that if she is still set on her dream school after she graduates, then she should maybe get a part time job and consider postsponing going until she's at least a little more financially stable. I'd also say that this isn't meant to destroy her future, but to both teach her that there are consequences to thoughtless actions and to ensure that she doesn't do such a thing ever again. You could have lost her that night, and you both would be crushed if that happened, not to mention that her brother would likely feel that it was his fault, being that it was his car. \n\nIf she isn't one to hold onto a grudge for forever, and has even a little common sense, then she'll see that this isn't the \"you're ruining my liiiifeeeea\" that she thinks right now and see that all that happened was justified and maybe even a lifelesson she'll look back on in the future before getting behind the wheel drunk.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She's lucky she did get in more serious trouble. Her brother could press charges for stealing the car which incidentally would probably ruin any chance of getting into a decent college itself.\n\nActions has consequences, she stole a fucking car, she got drunk, she allowed her drunk friend to drive the car SHE stole while drunk and crashed that car.\n\nYou don't get to destroy something worth 30k then say well I don't want serious consequences so buy something 10k to replace it. If you don't want to risk replacing a 30k car, don't steal a 30k car, it's really not that difficult a concept to understand.\n\nThis is completely and utterly black and white, there is no grey here, she's completely in the wrong and you paying for a new car with YOUR money that you intended to give to her for college is her fault and prevented your son having to go and file charges on her to get insurance to cover it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you didn't make this right he could sue you and your wife. Where would the money have come from after the lawsuit? So the only 2 answers are her fund or you and your wife's money from elsewhere. I bet if you took that money from your saving, retirement, etc your wife would be singing a different tune. \n\nThe only part that is questionable is 30k to 40k. You probably should have just done the 30k or maybe 32 or 33k. For the inconvenience he suffered. Going 10k more was a bit much imo but not enough for an Ahole vote.", "NTA\n\nif it isn't the old consequences of her own actions coming to roost...", "NTA my parents didn't put a cent towards my college, but always wanted me to achieve great things, just not on their dime. 15k is more than enough to contribute. She has a LOT of audacity and should be in more legal trouble. She should count her blessings and start looking into community college, which is still quality education and a great choice.", "NTA.  Sister screwed up and is literally paying for it.  For those asking about insurance, insurance would only cover if the son reports the car stolen.  Would the sister prefer a felony charge instead of being out 30k for college?", "ESH\n\nYour daughter broke the law and should absolutely pay the cost. But you didn't just pay the cost. You handed over an extra ten thousand. That was unacceptable of you. You owe her that ten thousand *back*.\n\nTell her to get a job to start earning back some of the money that went to replace the car. In two years, she could earn a significant amount of cash. Obviously, it's not the full $30k, but at least some. And you should still be adding to her college fund for those last two years.\n\nHave another conversation with your daughter. Lay out how dangerous her behaviour was and the fact that she is lucky to have not gone to prison. Perhaps you should have her do some charity work related to underage drinking or reckless driving. Explain that her poor decisions jeopardised her future, not your response, but that you shouldn't have taken the extra $10k, and that you will replace it\n\nThere are also lots of scholarship options out there for college. Some of these are not taken up every year because nobody applies for them, but there *is* money out there. If a student does a little research and applies for lots of scholarships, they will frequently get a few thousand here or there. It's up to her to make up that money, but it's not impossible.\n\nEdit: cars depreciate in value like crazy. The car was worth $30k when he bought it. On average, about 15% of that value is gone just driving it off the lot. After a year, a $30k car has lost about 35% of its value. So the car was worth around $20k at the time of the accident. An insurance company would only pay out what the car is *currently worth*, not how much you paid for it. I'm a chartered accountant: this is standard practice to use current net book value rather than cost at purchase. So when I say that the original $30k should be repaid, I think I'm being more than fair. That covers what the car was currently worth, and some extra for damages and the inconvenience. I stand by saying that the extra $10k was wrong.", "INFO: Did your son not have insurance?

She made a string of stupid decisions that resulted in a financial loss of tens of thousands of dollars. Your daughter played a stupid game, she got a stupid prize. She needs to be made to understand that type of financial loss.\n\nI see commenters asking about insurance. Insurance doesn't just magically replace the car. At, best insurance will provide the current market value of the vehicle, so there is still financial damage since that is not full-replacement. Additionally, since it looks like your son resides at your home, that means insurance will consider your daughter an authorized user of the vehicle (and the friend who was driving as authorized due to having your daughter's permission) and will not even give current market value since they usually reduce coverage, if they provide any at all, to the vehicle owner when the driver is intoxicated (DUI coverage is for the other car or people who get injured from the driver's negligence).\n\nIt could be arguable that your daughter should have only been forced to give your son the $30K that he originally paid for the car. However, the price of both used and new cars has skyrocketed in the last two years and I think your daughter's reaction would be the same.", "NTA but man does the princess have a rude awakening coming", "Nta daughter is lucky son didn\u2019t report it", "NTA.\n\nI also have a question, and I don't really know the answer, but depending upon whatever university your daughter had her heart on attending, what makes her think that after this incident and police report that she will be accepted?\n\nShe destroyed the car; she has to replace it and not with a cheaper model.

However, if I were you, I\u2019d be pretty concerned about the fallout in your daughter\u2019s life. She is 16. She fucked up. Big time. But taking myself back to 16, I dealt with my parents playing favorites with my brother constantly. Even if that\u2019s not the case here, it may be how it seems to her, and this move has now maybe altered your relationship with your daughter for the rest of everyone\u2019s lives. If your daughter was indeed already struggling emotionally/mentally, this may catapult her off a cliff into completely giving up and seeing herself as a complete failure, why even bother trying at anything anymore, depression, etc. After all, she is 16.

Personally, I'd say NTA. I don't see why your son should be out on any of this and replacing his vehicle is the way to go, just sucks that it was an extra $10K to replace.
