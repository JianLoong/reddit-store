It's my third marriage. The theme is cosplay and I'm asking guests to participate by wearing costumes. I'm also asking for guests to bring a dish and their own alcohol, as we don't drink alcohol. The wedding is at me and my fianc\u00e9's home. My sister lives a few hours away. She has pets and is struggling to find pet care, stating it's due to the holiday weekend. She said her friends who often watch her pets are out of town and that a lot of the pet sitting services are increasing fees for the holiday. She can't bring her dogs to the wedding bc my dog doesn't get along with dogs. Due to not having pet care, she's taking the train in for the day, but can only stay for a few hours because of the holiday weekend train schedule. \n\nShe is refusing to wear a costume, stating it will be too much to navigate on the train. She likely will not bring a dish, either. I have offered to let her stay in and AirBnB with a group of guests she doesn't know. Her other option would be to get a hotel room or her own AirBnB. She could rent a car to bring her dog and stay for the weekend. That's what I want her to do. She feels as though the wedding is an inconvenience and that I'm asking a lot of her as a guest who is traveling for the wedding.\n\nAs of right now, she is stating she can only commit to a day trip via train, meaning she will only be at my wedding for a couple of hours.

Hopefully, three time's the charm.  Did she participate in your first two weddings?  You are demanding a whole lot from your \"guests\" who are probably all weddinged out, at this point.  You expect your sister to find boarding for her dogs (and she is correct...holiday weekend boarding spaces are limited, at a premium price, and often booked months in advance).  She must travel by train to attend your wedding, worry about purchasing a costume, along with bringing her own food and drink?!  You are lucky she is willing to attend at all!   So, what exactly is it that YOU are paying for, in this third wedding celebration?  No venue, no food or drink, and extra expenses for everyone who accepts the \"honor\" of fully participating in your wedding event?  \n\nPersonally, I think your sister should stay home and snuggle with her pups, watch a holiday movie, and enjoy some nachos and homemade sangria!

You are asking an awful lot of people, on an already traditionally busy weekend. Do you really want to try to force someone into a costume?

If you want her to be THAT involved then you should pay for her + her dog to get there as well as their accommodation.

That makes more sense than this type of post being real. \"My third wedding\" should have been a buried leed in the comments if OP wants to be more convincing next time.", "There is always _something_ else to do.", "That's more of a fourth-wedding event. At this one, you should wear a polo and preferably one that's clean.", "That is excellent.", "every fancy dress costume as a teenage had a load of rockers, so guys in jeans and t-shirts", "By this point and in your 40s, you should be aware that you are asking a huge amount from your guests. Like way, way more than the average wedding. If guests are excited to do all these things, great. Many people will not be. Your sister is one of them. Personally, the costume/potluck/BYOB on a super expensive holiday weekend is something I *might* do for someone very close to me. It sounds from your description like your sister is not close to you. If that's true, why not be grateful she's coming and graciously accept what she's offering? Relationships don't get better by demanding more than people are willing to give. They just don't.", "For the love of god, just spring for pizzas. You don't have to provide a gourmet meal, but you should provide *something*.

Again, the absolute bare minimum of hosting.", "I saw that you are part of a group that enjoys Cosplay. I think you will find that that group is very excited about this, but others may be much less excited about wearing a costume.\n\nYour sister seems to be doing all she can to make it work and to be there for you, even if it\u2019s not exactly how you would like it to be. \n\nI hope you and your fiance are very happy. Sometimes it's not easy finding the right person, no judgement there.", "You've had 2 bites of the wedding apple, and this is the 3rd.  Any expectations for guests to meet your requirements in order to attend this round are just too much.  Especially if those requirements pose a hardship for guests like your sister.  Most important thing is that she can be there with you.  It's not always about what you want.  In this case, it's being happy with what she can give.", "Answer the question about what you're actually providing for guests. \n\nAt this point, this wedding sounds like a chore in every instance for guests and I don't blame your sister. I'd resent having to buy a special outfit, bring a meal and buy my own booze. It seems like a \"pick one of three\" situation to make it worth it.", "People generally get lower key the more weddings they have, you\u2019ve taken it way up several notches and should be grateful she\u2019s doing what she can. You\u2019ve basically created a holiday invite where you don\u2019t have to lift a finger but everyone else has to cater to your whims.", "YTA-for these ridiculous rules.

I\u2019m a wedding planner and it always sets the tone for the whole wedding when the bride and groom expect the guests to feed *them* instead of the other way around. Guests are doing you a favor by bearing witness to your union, traveling to the location at their own expense, possibly purchasing clothing, etc., so it\u2019s your job to feed them.", "I think it\u2019s funny that OP is basically making her guests pay for her wedding. \n\nShe\u2019s willing to pay for an air bnb for guests. But won\u2019t get one for her sister. She expects her sister to stay with strangers or pay for one herself.

Or is that just a TV thing?", "I also get the feeling that OP will expect a big fuss for the anniversary as well, the holiday weekend will no longer be about the family and getting together and being thankful to have each other, it will be about her.", "Then you should tell her that\u2019s your intention because you miss spending time with her. Without more explanation, being upset about her coming in for the day just comes across being a bridezilla. \n\nIf she still doesn\u2019t want to spend more time on the wedding then respect it and put effort into working with her to get together more often in the future.", "The bride entering to \u201cBackstreet\u2019s Back.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my god, we\u2019re back again\u2026.\u201d", "The invitations did say it was costume optional. With her being my sister, I would just really like for her to be more a part of it.", "Right?!  This all sounds awful!", "Jake from State Farm. Red polo and khakis.", "Thing is if you are off work for the holiday weekend, live nearby and into cosplay then OP\u2019s wedding is perfect. I can totally see the logic of potluck too when it\u2019s a weekend many people are already doing a dish, buying a dish and it combines low key third wedding with Friendsgiving. Genius\u2026\n\nUnless you invite anyone who doesn\u2019t fall into your quite specific demographic and is suddenly faced with Ultimate Wedding Hell: the Deluxe version. Time off over the holiday weekend, reduced travel, places to stay, dogsitters and increased costs while literally being told you can\u2019t **really** skip the costume or the dish or you don\u2019t love me. What is chill for the core group is fraught for the outsiders.\n\nIf OP was just doing this for her cosplay friends who find it hang out plus then she would be a great host. But she\u2019s crossing the streams and getting mad when sister tries to use a ford to test waters and is being told to dangle off the rope bridge instead while OP fails to grasp she is the one making the bridge creaky.\n\nIt\u2019s a home wedding right? Why not Zoom it so people can see the ceremony and not travel if all these extras are a block and then invite the sister to a wedding celebration with other people who had the same combo of issues preventing getting there or even a one on one around sister\u2019s needs to say \u2018I pushed the wrong points. I really value you and wanted you there but I\u2019m just happy you are here now.\u2019\n\nShe\u2019s asking opposing forces to meld together here and its coming across entitled because its so polarizing and OP doesn\u2019t realise people need more middle ground for a third wedding. The marriage may be serious but the wedding for family is a lot a lot quicker if they already did stuff for you as bride/groom twice before.\n\nAlso PSA: you can decide to have a child free/cosplay/puppet themed/destination wedding/holiday wedding/colour moodboard look/vegan in a family of ranchers/steakhouse for Hindus but you have to realise that the more niche your wedding mix and match is the more people are likely to say no. Sometimes it because guests are selfish and want to punish vegans say for forcing it but sometimes it is path of least resistance. If I have to pay more, spend time and effort on a costume/shopping for an exact shade of mauve, fly to Hawaii and calculate that against my overall budget of finances, time, responsibilities, work restrictions and how much it feels like a test or chore you earn admission via then a lot of goodwill goes. Choose your choice but realise your choices impact what others choose.\n\nMy BF loves cosplay. I am a make up artist. I love doing the prep with him including customising, styling etc. He is so happy we enjoy that together. He also knows I detest fancy dress or cosplay on myself and would rather eat worms than partake. I will go out of my way pre event to support cosplay. I have hated dressing up like that in any form since childhood and honestly I would rather fly to Hawaii on the holiday weekend at astronomical cost for a sibling\u2019s wedding than even wear a very basic costume on public transport. I would love to have a wedding themed around greatest fashion pieces of all time for example but I know others are going to hate having to suss out McQueen bumsters versus Dior New Look or Sonia Rykel stripes vs breton and to manage LBD without copying Hepburn in Givenchy (the sexy cat of such occasions effort wise) or try to mimic the Antwerp school or Japanese tailoring. All perfectly easy to me because I love it, know it and understand what it entails. But nope, society is not going to be as ok with it because its more niche than cosplay and it\u2019s a selfish flex solely for me. So I think it\u2019s ok to say \u2018who is this theme for and what might others take more broadly?\u2019 before people blow relationships up over \u2018their thing.\u2019", "Thanks! Life doesn\u2019t always go as planned.", "Lol.

They were fine with that, that was their plan.", "Ok, we've stumbled on the one good reason to go to this wedding", "Or not. I'm suuuuuper into fancy dress, but not everyone feels comfortable in a costume.", "I've tried. But she's very controlling/demanding and asks for a month's notice to get together, claiming her job requires it. I let her know every year that she can just stop by whenever on holidays. She's always welcome here.", "Wanting her to be more a part of it is fine. Pushing her to do something she is not comfortable with, is not. From your other comments it seems like you wish your sister was closer to you, giving her a hard time when you are already asking a lot of your guests, is going to make your relationship worse, not better.", "Is SHE into cosplay though?", "Then buy or rent her a cosplay outfit", "What??? I had not gotten that far. I figured in her 20s the way she was acting!", "I don\u2019t cosplay, but that would be pretty cute to witness I think. X", "Then where a fancy dress and say your costume is a wedding guest,  come on now.\n\nBut op is ta", "You are asking people to wear *costumes*, bring a dish, and their own drinks to your THIRD wedding and you think she is the one who is very controlling/demanding? \n\nFor your fourth wedding maybe just elope.", "An open invitation doesn\u2019t express your desire to be with her tho.

The best you can do is be clear in your communication and be respectful of her choices.", "Lots of jobs require it. Mine requires six weeks.", "Asking for a month I\u2019m advance isn\u2019t being controlling or demanding. People have lives outside of their extended families.

I live 5 plus hours away with no holiday traffic, have two dogs that I have a hard time finding sitters for, and work in a job that is the busiest this time of year.  \n\nI love my family and do try to go down and visit at least two times a year. I go when it\u2019s convenient for me or there\u2019s a milestone in someone\u2019s life. It takes a lot of planning for me to go, so a months notice is not unreasonable to request. \n\nHow often do you go and visit her? I also don\u2019t push myself to go see my sisters who are an hour my from parents, since in the 15 years I have lived here, they have both only come up once to visit and it wasn\u2019t just for me. My parents come up every year so I make more of an effort to go see them. Maybe if you spent more time trying to see her where she lives, she would make more of an effort to see.", "Unless she doesn\u2019t want to play dress up. Then she is expressly unwelcome.", "Even if her job didn't require it, I'd want a lot of notice if I had to take the train a few hours to get to my destination.\n\nIf anybody sounds demanding, it's you.", "I think this is the real issue: you want to spend time with your sister, but not on her terms, in fact you assume that she's basically lying to get her own way. You need to take a step back and say 'maybe her employer really does need more notice. Perhaps her life is more difficult than I realise. Also, maybe if I want to see her, I should make the effort, and go to her, not vaguely expect her to come to me on my terms.' You say she's 'always welcome', when in fact she's not, because you're unwilling to make accommodations for her circumstances. If you want a relationship, you need to remove some of the barriers, and to your sister, last minute plans are a barrier. She most likely doesn't feel comfortable 'stopping by' anywhere.", "Ha she\u2019s demanding because she needs notice for a get together because of her work (news flash most companies require a months notice for time off) so what does that make you?", "Jesus wept. You clearly have no idea of other peoples lives. A lot of companies require 4-6 weeks notice of holidays. An open invitation of \u201cjust pop by\u201d isn\u2019t helpful when she lives hours away and will require time booked off.

Not even slightly.", "My job requires 6 months and even then it\u2019s not a guarantee especially at a holiday.", "A months notice is really not that hard to give.\nSome people have busy schedules. It\u2019s also not easy to just stop by someone\u2019s house on the holiday when you live far. That would require her to make additional accommodations. This actually sounds more to me like a party than a wedding. I really hope you\u2019re not expecting people to get gifts.", "I haven't approached her about it since she said she was coming. I have just been sitting with all of this and thought getting an outside perspective was a good idea. Friends and other loved ones often take my side. :)", "Not that I know of. We don\u2019t talk very often. Her not wanting to dress up I guess would mean no.", "This is fair. I'm also thinking about what some others have said re: she's offering what she can. It might not be worth a discussion.", "Same", "Sorry, I'm from the UK - \"fancy dress\" means costume here.", "She's cheaping out to the max without making it a low-key wedding. If they didn't drink because of an alcohol problem and wanted a dry wedding then that would be totally fair. I'd get that. Asking people to bring their own liquor indicates they aren't uncomfortable being around booze, just with paying for it. I find the idea of a wedding potluck charming, but that's something I'd do for a chill backyard wedding where people were, ya know, allowed to wear whatever they want. Skipping catering in this context is not a good look. If this was real, anyhow (it's not).", "Good on you. Hopefully, this thread has made it clear that your sister is not being unreasonable, and you should be grateful for her engagement in the event in a way she can manage.", "I would absolutely not take her desire not to invest in a costume and travel in/shlep a costume as any reflection of her love for you. And I say this as someone who never missed a chance to dress in costume.", "If it's optional, then it shouldn't be a problem. You already know not everyone is going to show up in a costume to a \"cosplay optional\" wedding. \n\nI think you're being really inconsiderate as a host of this party.", "So you don\u2019t talk often, don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s into cosplay\u2026. And yet expect multiple things from her to accomodate you and your wedding. You\u2019re insane", "Maybe that's because you're a very self-absorbed person who seems to expect people to cater to you? It didn't even occur to you that she's not into the whole cosplay thing or how annoying it would be to wear a costume on a crowded train or that it's a holiday weekend or how inconvenient it would be for her to bring food and alcohol or the costs associated with her attending. When was the last time you went out of your way for her?", "Exactly. Stop being a brat. Who the hell wants to sit on a crowded train in a costume? And you expect her to bring food and alcohol, too? You're a terrible host.", "I think my point still stands haha. Anyone who doesn't like costumes can wear whatever they want and say they're dressed as a wedding guest.", "Well my point is that OP should be gracious about people not wanting to cosplay (which to me implies a high level of effort and possibly a specific genre or even fandom).", "I guess. But OP didn't require cosplay from a specific show or game, costume play can be literally anything and doesn't have to involve much/any effort at all."]}
