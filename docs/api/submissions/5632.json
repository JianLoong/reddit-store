You bought this for her to make her happy and that is clear.\nIt\u2019s not like buying lingerie and treating it like a gift for her when she didn\u2019t want it and it was for you, or buying her a stove to cook for you when she wanted a trip to Hawaii to relax. She wanted this stove! You *were* thoughtful and you *did* read the room.", "My mother would love this and honestly, so would the rest of my family and I too!", "How did SIL react to the \u201cfake diamond\u201d clap back?? NTA.", "Sounds like I have the same oven, and I love it! And at that price, I\u2019d have loved to have received it as a gift too hehe", "Ooh, I'm in the market for a good stand mixer.  Can you share the boyfriend -reviewed brand that you got?", "Then that's a yikes for you/your husband, but she clearly didn't feel like a maid.  I personally would be over the moon for this kind of present.", "Yep. I think a year or so ago, someone posted giving a vacuum and his wife hated it because she did the cleaning because she felt she has to, not wants to. The context is key!", "Yes, in this circumstance, it\u2019s less the appliance that is the gift than the \u201cIt\u2019s pricier with all the bells and whistles and goes above and beyond anything I would ever reasonably purchase for myself and the household otherwise. It\u2019s just specialized for you!\u201d \n\nYou didn\u2019t buy her a stove, you bought her a hobby-driven specialty toolkit that *just so happens* to come with a stove. That makes it a thoughtful gift.", "I WOULD LOVE A STATE-OF-THE-ART STOVE, DISHWASHER, WASHER AND DRYER, AND FRIDGE FOR CHRISTMAS. \n\nWhere are my appliance gifting darlings at?!!!!!\n\n(All this to say, appliance gifting should absolutely be a thing so long as it isn\u2019t bought with a joint account, is treated with respect deserving of the recipient, and is tailored to their tastes and desires)", "People like that are why people feel like they need to put disclaimers about how the title sounds.", "Oh I enjoy cooking. But it's still a gift for the family, not a gift for the wife. I certainly think a token gift alongside the cooker would be the right thing, but on it's own its not a gift for the wife.", "My dad got my mom a vacuum cleaner for their first Valentine's Day after they got married way back in 1995 and she LOVED it. Everyone I tell thinks it's a little weird though lol", "I\u2019d be excited over it too! NTA", "Ive had kitchen gadgets with wifi.....i ended up taking it back. 2 ovens would be handy for me though", "My mom has one and you can\u2019t set the timer or the oven temp on the actual stove, only through the app. Its a huge pita compared to how many times you\u2019d realistically need to shut the oven off from your living room.", "You can also do something like, put a chicken inside, even if you'll be gone all day, program the oven to start at a certain time (or just use your phone to start it whenever you want and turn it off whenever you want) so you come home to a hot, freshly roasted chicken just in time to eat.", "As someone with OCD, having stuff like this is a game-changer. I can't control my oven with an app, but I can control my security system and my garage door. No more worrying that I left the garage open and I also don't have to try to keep a hand free to type in the code for the alarm.", "Not sure if these are exactly the ones OP's talking about, but I have one of (the less expensive) ones on [this page](https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/ranges/all-ranges/?shop=Buy+Online&fuel_type=Gas) from Samsung.\n\nI love it tbh. The app is a little much, but the thing works better than any stove I've had and it's actually a lot easier to clean than most stoves I've had too. I don't think you can turn the oven ON with the phone but I do know you can send preheat instructions to it (but you need to physically go to the oven to turn it on following those instructions) and track your timers and stuff.", "TODAY I LEARNED. Here, take this award, it's all I've got.", "Specially if they got fancy upgrades to make my life easier, right?", "Also like, those things are EXPENSIVE!! I'd also LOVE a HUGE washer/dryer for Xmas, that way I can do giant loads of laundry LESS OFTEN. What's not to like?! LOL", "I did get a dishwasher for my birthday once, and honestly i was a bit annoyed, it didn\u2019t have several features that I prefer, but it did do the dishes fine for a few years. When it went he went shopping again and it wasn\u2019t a gift this time but he did get one with the features and some extra ones (it has a third rack that can be for silverware instead of the bucket, and the middle rack is adjustable in height so i can put travel mugs on it and fit the pots and dishes on the lower rack still!) so i both sides of the appliance giving risk. \nSounds like OP did well though, and is NTA.", "I think the gift was really the difference between getting a basic stove and investing in the extras that wife wanted. I ask for kitchen gadgets as gifts all the time, because they increase MY enjoyment of cooking. My mom just had carpal tunnel surgery and I gave her an electric can opener and a under cabinet mounted jar opener today, she LOVED it. The gift is in giving people things they wouldn\u2019t buy for themselves.", "For you maybe. But for me and clearly for the wide it is.", "I'm so excited for her as well!!!!", "Damn, now you'll know for sure who stole the last pudding", "Yup, I worked at best buy (HQ) for a few years, and the range of smart everythings that exist these days is mind-boggling! There are smart indoor growers, washing machines, etc too. You know, just in case you need to water your indoor plants while you're away, you can do it with your phone. LOL.", "I have that and always forget to look lol.", "I am going to need this in my next fridge.", "sweet baby jesus in the manger I need these things. my poor husband is going to be so busy finding me these things for our house when we buy one. hahahaha", "Leaving a chicken at over 40 degrees Fahrenheit and under 140 degrees Fahrenheit for hours is a huge food safety risk.", "Bad bot. Two week old account, all comments in last two hours. Reply irrelevant to comment thread. Report Spam - harmful bots", "Seeing the pic OP posted, I would definitely not be upset!!", "\u201cHave my standards fallen far enough to eat what\u2019s in here?\u201d", "Sounds like Samsung tbh. I have one similar. I can control the oven from my phone (I don't think I'm able to turn it on from my phone, but I can send instructions to it and just hit a button on the oven to start preheating) but I can turn it off from my phone. It also tells me if I left a burner on on the stove (somehow).", "https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/ranges/all-ranges/?shop=Buy+Online&fuel_type=Gas\n\nHere's a link to Samsung's page for them. You can probably find them cheaper elsewhere but most of the features he describes says Samsung to me.", "Samsung ranges have horrible reliability scores. And the knobs are ass.", "Do you hanker for a hunk of cheese?", "You can just say \u201cI didn\u2019t read the post before commenting\u201d instead of doubling down.", "Welp\u2026 looks like in 2023 I\u2019ll be making a Christmas list for the first time in 30 years!", "Please keep recommending products, im so excited about all of thsi", "My washer/dryer sends me a notification when it's done. It is excellent for actually getting my laundry dry despite ADHD.", "exactly! I can't tell you how much I enjoy being able to call my kids and be like \"um do we have X thing in the fridge\" But that requires them to actually pay attention to their phones instead of the computer when I'm out. :P", "But will it detect me putting the phone in my dishwasher?\n\n(It only happened once and thankfully I did not run it)", "Dinner\u2019s real light if they don\u2019t get back to you lol.", "I am so curious as to how that can happen."]}
