People get super weird about those like practical gifts. I love \u2018em lol I would be super happy with a new stove", "So she clearly loves it!  NTA.", "If your wife is happy, then don\u2019t worry about the opinions of some random internet strangers.", "She may love and appreciate it, but I still don't believe that's a spouse gift. It's an appliance. If she's happy, then really don't worry about others' opinions.", "NTA. You got a fancy replacement with features that she would like, it sounds like you've put thought into it and from what you said it sounds like your wife was happy with it. She also got you a 'useful' gift, seems like you're a good match to me. Maybe ask her about it though to make sure?", "Right- but you would have bought it anyway. \n\nOur stove broke 2 days ago. The replacement will come out of the house budget- no matter what we decide. It sounds like our issue is a lot like yours bc it\u2019s the heating element. \n\nWe\u2019ll be gutting the entire kitchen in the next 2 yrs so we\u2019ll probably go as cheap as possible to repair/replace bc I want a restaurant stove to replace it. (Large family) \n\nI\u2019ll be thrilled when it\u2019s fixed bc I would like to be able to cook again. But it will NOT be my Christmas present, even if we just go ahead and buy the $5K industrial stove. It\u2019s not a gift to me, it\u2019s a household appliance even though I have a preference.", "They make fridges that have cameras in them so you can check it from your phone if you aren't sure if you need something, but aren't at home.", "I recently purchased my parents a new stove. Some of the features are ridiculous. Alexa, wifi, delayed start, app control, etc etc", "Yup, and if you did forget, you can turn it off from your phone", "Omg this would actually be so helpful", "I want that.", "If she is happy with her gift just stop giving a fuck what other people think about it.", "So the stove could have been repaired for about $100. \n\nI would LOVE a new washer dryer, as our washer is a top load and I hate leaning into it, its hard on my back, and would love qn upgraded dryer as well. \n\nWe do share the car. \n\nShe doesn't really like to drive and we both WFH, so usually I drive us around. \n\nShe usually just uses it to go grocery shopping, which I don't like going with her for, because she goes  at least 3 times a week because she likes the meat at one place, the produce at another,  then another store is the only one that carries the brand of mayo she likes and has a better selection of dried peppers,  and she will just randomly brows everything and buy random things she never heard of, then stand in the store to Google ideas. The woman can spend like 4 hours in H Mart. \n\nHer car had its plates stolen and we didn't even put them back on for 2 years, when we replaced the batteries, renewed the registration and sold it. \n\nWe go most places together, so the car is warm for her too.", "Lmao what", "Gotcha!", "This reminds me of Father of the Bride when the bride got upset that the groom got her a blender as a house gift before realizing that it was because she liked to make smoothies for herself.", "This! This trick has saved me so much time. Never shred chicken by hand again.", "I like appliances, gift cards, and candles as gifts. People can go F off with their high expectations. I also like tequila.", "We have a wifi smoke alarm in the kitchen that alerts  our phone any time its set off. Usually her searing something will do it, but if she remembers she can pause it for 10 minutes on her phone. \n\nThese wifi things are getting crazy. Saw a water heater with wifi at the store too.", "He is quite literally asking for opinions when he posted here", "She litterally screamed when the delivery guy showed up with it and has been super excited to use it since. She sat and read the manual for like an hour telling me about all the things she can do with it.", "what \ud83e\udd2f", "Damn dude. What brand? Gas range? I kinda wanna get my mom one after reading this far down and all the features.", "Oh my God I just got weak in the legs", "As I said, if it works for you two, fine, but you should also understand where the rest of your family is coming from.", "The poster asked OP if his wife was OK w/ it and he just started going off on the features.\n\nAll I am saying is - yeah, features that OP thinks are cool isn't the point. How does the wife think about it?\n\nIf she is fine - great. If not, it is a terrible gift.", "Fuck what everyone else thinks then, she's happy and that's what matters. Hope you can both brush off their comments and not let it ruin your Christmas.", "Yup and some with screens on them, where you can knock on the door and it shows you what is inside.  They also have apps.", "they didn\u2019t ask since it\u2019s literally in the post that she loves it. they just said she likes it then it\u2019s a cool gift. reading 3 words shouldn\u2019t be that hard come on.", "Look at the original comment that OP replied to. A comment asking why the stove needs wifi.\n\nOP didn't even mention the cool features in the original post and he said the wife loves it. Plus, the features make it a better gift.", "You\u2019re never allowed to meet my hubby \ud83d\ude02", "They foresee my ADHD issues\u2026 cameras in my fridge is fine, no where else in the house though lol", "I have this fridge and it is everything y'all are thinking it is and are slightly jealous about. \n\nNow, onto a wifi oven!"]}
