She said it just doesn\u2019t feel right because of what I\u2019m doing so now she\u2019s just going to be in the crowd instead. I said \u201cI understand your decision\u201d \ud83d\ude44 I know I need to toughen up. I\u2019m not changing my mind.", "I have to say, \u2018Commander in Cheeks\u2019 is truly magnificent to behold. Kudos.", "Yeah I expressed my feelings to her. Our relationship is finally getting to a good spot so I\u2019m learning how to communicate better with her. She needs to learn to stick up for herself, and her daughter. She tries not to make waves and it drives me crazy.", "Exactly. \n\n\"I'm sorry to disappoint you, Uncle Mike and Aunt Lucy. But a wedding is meant to be a day for friends and family to join us in a celebration of our love and to  show support for our union. \nCousin Marie has made it clear she not only doesn't celebrate or support this marriage, she views it as an abomination. It would be unfair to me and my fiance to bring that negativity into our special day\n\nMy decision on this is final. If you choose not to come as a result, so be it.\"", "To spite me \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02", "When I came out as trans and my family was like your cousin. My sister got married a few years later and had a 100% gender flipped queer only second wedding (real wedding for her friends and his family, fuck you wedding for our family). It was great joy to see our extended family cowering in a corner from 4 fabulous drag queens dancing after having a few drinks. Support looks different than what your parents are doing. \n\nYou deserve what ever you want for your wedding\u2026 if that means excluding people then so be it. Spend the day with people who love you not the idea of you. NTA and I agree with everyone that this is a great time to thin the herd", "Have you told your family the reason your cousin isn\u2019t invited? Since you\u2019ve been kind enough to your family to not make a fuss during holidays, it\u2019s possible they don\u2019t realise. If they don\u2019t know, the ones who are upset care more about your homophobic cousin than you. And if so I\u2019m sorry for you, that sucks.", "Under the heading of \u2018the truth hurts\u2019, your mom put herself in the middle. No one can be \u2018put\u2019 in the middle without their permission. This is what NOT putting yourself in the middle sounds like \u2018I love and support my daughter. She is a fully functioning adult. This is her wedding and her decision.  If you don\u2019t like it, you need to speak to her, not me.  It\u2019s up to you whether or not you want to attend. Thanks for calling!\u2019", "Continue to stand firm! It\u2019s your day. You (and your fianc\u00e9) get to choose who is invited and who is not. Why the hell do other family members thinks they get to have input on the guest list. And why the hell would someone who is a homophobe want to be there, other than to potentially cause problems. \nNTA", "I admire your shiny spine. Homophobe enablers are also homophobes. Also why the hill would she want to come to a wedding that she disagrees with. Have a great wedding!", "no one is made to be a middle man, your mum needs to be as firm in this as you are in your stance. there\u2019s literally zero argument here: your wedding, your choice of guests. if i were your mum, i\u2019d have told the homophobe calling my daughter a flipping abomination, and anyone supporting that bigotry to not let the door hit them on the way out.  your mum should be supporting YOU, not peacekeeping. i wish the aggrieved bigots would leave your immediate family out of it, but they won\u2019t if they know a peacekeeper will walk on eggshells around them to avoid conflict. i genuinely can\u2019t see wanting to be around anyone that thought, let alone said that about my kid. good riddance. rant aside, i feel for your mum, and those pestering her suck. you are absolutely NTA, and i hope you get to enjoy your special day with no assholes around :)", "She chooses yo be the middleman, she's really just a spectator with an judgemental overwhelming sense of self importance", "Probably because she wasn't invited in the first place. Duh.", "May you be blessed with peace being strong.", "You have my very unneeded permission to cry about it, but only once (twice, max).", "NTA. Congratulations. May you and your wife have a lifetime of love and happiness.", "Omgggggggg the fact that well behaved, kind people like yourself have to be run over so crazy Susie can get a pass makes me so frustrated. Fuck that noise. I\u2019m 45 now and done putting up with it. We need to stop normalizing it. If she can\u2019t be tolerant of your sexuality why should you be tolerant of her whackadoodery???\n\nEdit to add: NTA", "Your mom is telling you not to make waves, not realizing that the waves were made by your cousin years ago. Stay strong, you deserve to have your day with people that support you. The \u201ccrazy cousin\u201d doesn\u2019t get a pass to be hateful!", "You may want to consider hiring security. One doesn\u2019t need an invitation to show up and make a scene.", "I would honestly uninvited that family member now. And no, you should not change your mind.", "Uninvite her.", "\"If you choose to support a homophobe on the day of my wedding, you're no longer welcome to attend.\"\n\nGo nuclear if you want.", "She is making waves, they\u2019re just all in your direction. NTA", "Lord some people got too much time on their hands. Have fun at your wedding! Wishing you and future wife blessings \u2764\ufe0f", "Exactly this.  Also blast them that if they have a problem with YOUR decision, they should speak with YOU and not your mom.   That way you\u2019ll know first had who the homophobes are in your family and will not need to get that information through your mom.  You may also find people who need to be uninvited, should they continue to blast your, support your cousin and still think they can attend.", "My usual wording in conflicts like this is \u201cYou\u2019ll do what you think is right, just as I do.\u201d", "Yup. Tell your family *exactly* what your cousin said to you and that you will do your cousin the favour of keeping her away from the abomination and yourself the favour of not being judged by someone at the wedding.", "That second wedding sounds amazing.", "Holy shit, that sounds like the absolute best wedding! \n\nThe extended family cowering in the corner - wow. How much of an asshole do you have to be to not have fun at a party like that!", "Agree! OP, make sure your whole family knows what the cousin said and how they treated you, make sure they have an \"informed decision\" to make when deciding if they want to attend the wedding or not. Like this you're sure you know the homophobes from the uniformed ones."]}
