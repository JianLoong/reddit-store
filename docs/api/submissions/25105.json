K I'll be the crazy cousin then and I'll preface my vows by promising to \"protect my SO from *you right there in the crowd, you, you, my crazy cousin, and anyone like them*\"", "Probably yes, but putting it absolutely bluntly is a pretty clear sign of what you are doing, why, *and you will not be changing your mind*. The purpose is to end the conversation.", "That would be a PERFECT message to family members.  So well said.", "\"Dear Family, Cousin is not included in my wedding because she told me, to my face, that I was an abomination while waving a Bible at me.  As you may be aware, people don't generally invite people who call them an abomination (in those words) to their weddings.  So if you agree with Cousin, I would prefer not to have you at my wedding or in my life.  And if you disagree, I look forward to a joyous celebration with you. Best, OP\"\n\nNTA", "No Nta why would she want to go", "This is great. Otherwise, in the name of \"harmony\" people will down play the hatred that Griselda spewed.

None of these people deserve to be in your life, period.", "people pleasing & enabling, its harmful to your relationship. if she loves you and supports you, she should also be advocating for you. by not saying anything or not making waves or setting boundaries with her family, shes in essence, failing to support YOU.\n\nif She's not doing that, then she's not really supportive. hopefully she gains some courage and comes around.", "You are NTA and you are right about mental health issues.  Having mental health issues is NOT an excuse for being homophobic or bigoted in any other way.  The family members who are upset with you for not inviting your homophobic cousin are probably homophobic themselves, either just more polite about or not willing to own up to it.\n\nWe LGBTQ+ have to put up with so much crap from straight people, and it\u2019s getting worse again thanks to Republicans and so-called \u201cchristians\u201d.  You should not have to put up with all this BS around your wedding.  Tell the family members in question that if they have any issues with how you are handling the situation, they are cordially invited not to attend.

It\u2019s up to you to determine what resonates with you, or doesn\u2019t. But your mom struck me as a people pleaser. People pleasing is a coping mechanism and is a plague in our society. People who just want to keep the peace at all cost because\u2026they are afraid. Afraid of what? I\u2019m not sure. But a homophobe should not be handed an invitation to a gay wedding. You don\u2019t need to be gay to get that. I\u2019m not gay. My daughters a little young but if it turns out she wants to be with a woman, I will verbally assault any \u201cfamily member\u201d who wants to traumatize her with bible verses.", "From reading OP's responses in the comments, turns out she's still homophobic anyhow hah", "Get ahead of it with your own group text to the entire family.

People that have not, do not, and will not, support our choice of life partners in each other, are not invited.\n\nOf course, love is also about forgiveness.

I would be too.", "No it is simple logic. Just admit being wrong and move.", "NTA This is supposed to be a day of celebration, why would you invite someone who looks down on you and judges you? I wouldn't invite her to my wedding, so why should you?  Tell your family that you have no problem inviting her, but because of her bigoted attitude, you don't trust her not to ruin your wedding.\n\nWho is paying for your wedding?

I apologise to all the Griseldas out there LOL", "I wanted to include something about OP's mom but ran out of steam. This is perfect.", "This. I would create a group text and tell them all exactly this and then include leave my mom out of this. If you have something to say then say it to me.

No real change.", "OP has said there has been zero apology.  What more information do you need?", "OP has already given that INFO in her comments."]}
