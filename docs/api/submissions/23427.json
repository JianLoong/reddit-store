You can't help that your mom doesn't have any boundaries. You can't control your mom, but you absolutely should keep your own boundaries.\n\nBut going to a birthday party is a WANT, not a need.

This was apparently not an important enough boundary for your mother. \n\nYou help her a lot, which is nice.

Your boundary is your boundary, whether your mother or sister agree/respect it.\n\nMaybe if she's going to be a night owl, the kids sleep at your place, or the makes accomodation that whomever is watching them at her place can stay all night.", "NTA for saying no. But it\u2019s not your job to set your mother\u2019s boundaries, so she can do as she wishes.", "NTA\n\nNo-notice babysitting for a party is not reasonable. Can maybe the kid just spend the whole night upstairs?", "Not your kid not your responsibility. You\u2019re the opposite of TA, you\u2019re the awesome aunt that helps out when she wants to.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour m,other is NOT stepping in for YOU. She is doing something for your sister that has NOTHING to do with you. Your mom is an adult and responsible for her decissions.", "NTA. Your boundary is your boundary and it\u2019s a completely reasonable one at that. It\u2019s unfortunate for you that your mother feels compelled to help, because I do understand the guilt that can come with that.

Your mom will either learn to set her own boundaries or will be walked all over but that\u2019s not on you. Edited for typo", "NTA your mother could have and should have said no. The sister can pay for a sister or don't go out.", "NTA sounds like your sister is taking advantage as she knows one of you will always say yes. If this is a constant occurrence then you are being enablers and allowing her to get away with not taking care of her own child. \n\nI'm sure there would be the case where she tells her friends yes, then when you/mom to say no she would make out to them that you're the bad guys and you may have her friends then texting you trying to guilt trip you into taking care of the child so she can party.", "You're all adults and can make your own choices and face your own consequences. If your mom wants to help out, that's her decision. NTA", "NTA", "I don't think you are ah for setting a boundary. However, I would never let my sister use my sick mother. Granted, I would have asked the child and find my sister and drop her off the kid. Your sister is the ah here. \n\nAnyhow, your mother needs to learn to say no and maybe, this will show her that she is not able to care for the child.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are not an asshole for not wanting to babysit your nephews for 7 hours with short notice. You have a right to set a boundary and to prioritize your own sleep and well-being.\n\n* Your sister is being unreasonable and irresponsible by expecting you or your mother to always be available to watch her kids while she goes out. \n* Your mother is not obligated to go, she is choosing to go. She should also set a boundary and say no, especially if she is feeling sick.\n* You are not responsible for her choices or your sister's lack of planning. \n\nYou are not the asshole, they are a bunch of ass holes.", "NTA Your refusal was reasonable, and your mother did not have to step in for you. It was her choice. She is a doormat, and your sister is an A H.", "NTA not your kid not your problem. Your sister cna hire someone to watch her kid til 4am instead of expecting her family to be at her beck and call", "I may get downvoted down this but\u2026 \nSister NTA, she can always ask, it doesn\u2019t matter how last minute. \nYou NTA, but you coulda helped out. \n\nBut if you felt bad about your mom doing it, then maybe you should listen to your gut and just step up.", "I think you are on cusp YTA because while it's fine for you to decline babysitting as is your right--you should extend the same courtesy to your mother's decision.  Your behavior creeps into the AH territory after \nyou tried to persuade your mom not to babysit at all.  It comes off as if you aren't giving the same level of respect to your mom in regards to allowing her to make her own decisions independent of your feelings on the matter. Why didn't you offer some sort of compromise where the children could have a sleepover with grandma so no one has to be awoken when mom returns . Also it seems like your sister is raising the children in a single parent household so maybe she just needs a night off to engage in an activity unrelated to her role as parent/head of household and your mom can see that which is why she agreed to the last minute request. If she was doing this every weekend then I could see the need to sit down as a family and address those issues at that time. And also it's not as easy or comfortable for some people to trust strangers to care for her children so hiring a sitter is its own set of problems. Your sister did the right thing when she asked for help babysitting and as long as she doesn't give any pushback if her family chooses to decline due to the short notice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why can't you take the couch or something?", "She knew about this party and asked you last minute. That's a ridiculous amount of time to babysit and I'm sure she didn't offer to pay.
