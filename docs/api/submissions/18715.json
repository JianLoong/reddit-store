Chuck (25M) is the DM. May and Rayne have dated for 4 years; their characters are dating in the show, and have forced their relationship to be the show\u2019s focus. Development for any other character is always second to their flirting. Once, when setting up a rare plot point for my character, I was cut off in the middle so the two of them could flirt for the remaining two hours of the session. This stretches 1-2 episodes into 8+ episodes. All social media is about their relationship, with no mention of other characters. I talked to Chuck about these issues, but he excused the behavior as May and Rayne being \u201cbig personalities\u201d that \u201cdeserve\u201d more of the spotlight. There have been many other cases of problematic behavior by May and Rayne, like censorship, keeping players from opportunities, and recording through medical issues. Recently Eve left because of these issues.\n\nGem, Eve, and I are close from talking about issues we have in our lives and the podcast.\n\nLast night I was pulled into a group call with the cast and was fired from the podcast for \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d. They said Gem told them details about our friendship. They demanded that I fess up to an affair with Gem and \u201cdisgusting\u201d behavior, although everything they listed as problematic was just normal friend behavior. Gem was as confused as I was, as we are just friends, and we both said as such.\n\nHere is the thing: my partner is close with Gem too, and they joke about running away together. When this was brought up, they brushed it off, and said the podcast cannot continue due to Gem and I\u2019s \u201cbehavior\u201d. This entire time, Chuck was basically silent, only noting that \u201ctrust was broken\u201d.\n\nWorst example of something they consider to be disgusting behavior: once I made plans to meet up with Gem. She ended up being near my work, so I grabbed dinner with her and her brother the night before we planned.  We all still spent the next day together as scheduled, partner included. Gem and I bought each other dice. When explaining nothing bad happened, they insisted we had secret meetings and that our behavior is cheating. They even said that buying dice for each other made May \u201cwant to throw up\u201d. This was probably the worst behavior brought up in the 45 minutes of being screamed at. This entire time, no one asked to speak to my partner or Eve.\n\nSince then, the three of them have told most people in our community about our \u201caffair\u201d. Gem has not stopped apologizing for telling May things about us, but we are fine as she did not disclose anything I consider private. Gem explained that she was wary of me at first from past experiences but that stopped when she got to know me, meaning the issues brought up now are over six months old.

Maybe even reach out to other ppl in your community to see if any of them would like to be on as guests.", "NTA sounds almost like they weren't accusing you of cheating on your partner but on cheating on the group and the game. That being said, I'm guessing they'd picked up on yours and Gem's unhappiness, especially with Eve leaving, and figured the two of you would be next. This was likely just their way of trying to get ahead of it by casting the blame on you instead of looking bad if you left and aired your grievances with the community.\n\nEither that or the couple that started dating at 18 and 26 have a bad grasp of what relationships actually look like, which is equally plausible.", "Didn\u2019t read you are yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
