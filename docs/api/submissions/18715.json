I talked to Chuck about these issues, but he excused the behavior as May and Rayne being \u201cbig personalities\u201d that \u201cdeserve\u201d more of the spotlight. There have been many other cases of problematic behavior by May and Rayne, like censorship, keeping players from opportunities, and recording through medical issues. Recently Eve left because of these issues.\n\nGem, Eve, and I are close from talking about issues we have in our lives and the podcast.\n\nLast night I was pulled into a group call with the cast and was fired from the podcast for \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d. They said Gem told them details about our friendship. They demanded that I fess up to an affair with Gem and \u201cdisgusting\u201d behavior, although everything they listed as problematic was just normal friend behavior.

They even said that buying dice for each other made May \u201cwant to throw up\u201d. This was probably the worst behavior brought up in the 45 minutes of being screamed at.

Gem has not stopped apologizing for telling May things about us, but we are fine as she did not disclose anything I consider private. Gem explained that she was wary of me at first from past experiences but that stopped when she got to know me, meaning the issues brought up now are over six months old.

That being said, I'm guessing they'd picked up on yours and Gem's unhappiness, especially with Eve leaving, and figured the two of you would be next. This was likely just their way of trying to get ahead of it by casting the blame on you instead of looking bad if you left and aired your grievances with the community.\n\nEither that or the couple that started dating at 18 and 26 have a bad grasp of what relationships actually look like, which is equally plausible.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If all is good with them I don't understand the drama. The only thing I would have done differently was get ahead of things in social circles and any places you care about online.", "Looks like the only fantasy/in-game behavior is what\u2019s mentioned in the first paragraph. May and Rayne\u2019s characters flirt a lot in-game, overshadowing the characters that are played by others. \n\nD&D is a cooperative game (or *should* be) and there\u2019s usually an expectation that the player characters share the spotlight most of the time. There will probably be moments that are tailored towards giving a certain character a chance to shine, but these moments shouldn\u2019t happen for one character more than others. In this case, it sounds like May and Rayne\u2019s characters are constantly in the spotlight in a way that actively takes away opportunities from other characters and detracts from the other players\u2019 overall experience. It\u2019s like your friends hogging Smash Bros all night and when they finally let you play they just beat you up immediately.", "Two players are apparently seriously afflicted with main character syndrome and continuously derail game sessions to focus on themselves.  The other three have approached the DM about this, who seems strangely reluctant to get involved.  The two drama llamas are now stirring the pot with a broad spoon to get OP banned from the game.  I\u2019m betting the DM did tell them who brought up the issue, and this is their response.  Again, the DM sounds ridiculously reluctant to intervene, which raises all kinds of flags in their direction.", "I wish I could have! I called one friend minutes after the call ended, and she already knew. My guess is they told everyone what happened beforehand so I couldn\u2019t get in front of it.", "I'm a novice DnD player. What type of characters do you typically play? If you'd rather DM about this, feel free to send me a message.", "Oh I\u2019m happy to talk about this! I really enjoy magic users, and finding interesting ways to flavor their magic and classes in new, unique ways. For example, before I was kicked out of this game because of the issues above (Chuck was in the game), I was playing a Dragonborn cleric who worshipped the economy. I\u2019m also happy to provide more examples, just DM me. I\u2019d love to talk about your characters as well. :)", "NTA, I'd make your own post (as in, with input from Gem and your partner, probably cross-post the essence of it on Gem's sm from her POV too) on your own social media- at least some of your fans probably follow you if your accounts are public. Lay out your/gems side, your partner knowing about everything with Gem and being just as confused as you, even the sidelining stuff and why Eve left if Eves OK with it (Eve could also post about leaving if she wants). Keep it calm/professional, try to focus on what YOU know your actions actually were and YOUR feelings about the bizarre meeting instead of speculating on other people's motivations. \n\nAnd then go hang out with people who are better friends than Chuck, May, and Rayne, at the table and away from it!", "NTA", "I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t understand what this means", "WOOOOW. It's been a long time since I've heard of this type of drama during a campaign.\nGoes without saying, NTA.\nAnd good riddance.", "If it's an entertainment podcast, you may have to accept that it went a direction you never intended. And if you're ok with being a part of the May and Rayne show, you can stay. But if you truly want it to be more DnD focused, you gotta leave, even though it means starting over somewhere else and losing the followers you thought were there for DnD.\n\nNTA, but it's not going to change. You either have to make peace with it, or leave if it'll continue to annoy you.", "Glad someone else caught that about the age gap. 30 and 22 is totally fine, but then i read they\u2019ve been dating for 4 years I was like hold up\u2026 YIKES", "Right? Time to tell my partner he cheated on me with the girl who bought everyone dice for Christmas lol", "Losing the entire cast and crew and having the campaign end up near solely being the two of them flirting is probably going to be the death knell of the channel.", "\"Oh no people enjoying things! That's... that's... *cringe!!*\""]}
