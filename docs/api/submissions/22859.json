I adopted this hobby around two years ago and since then, I've been raising a lively flock of six. They're delightful, quirky, and they supply fresh eggs that I either sell to neighbours or use in my cooking.  \nMy sister (32F), who lives across town, recently went through a divorce. Since then, she's been bringing my niece (3F) over to my place more often as I help her out by babysitting. My niece has taken quite a liking to the chickens; she enjoys feeding them and watching them potter about in the yard. It's turned into a unique way for us to bond.  \nHowever, the predicament here involves my sister. She has developed an irrational fear of avian flu. She believes that my chickens are a health risk, causing her anxiety, and she worries that her daughter might contract the disease from them. Despite my attempts to assure her that the chickens are vaccinated, well-cared-for, and pose no risk, her fears persist.  \nShe's been pressuring me to \"dispose of\" my chickens, arguing it's for the safety of her child. Her logic revolves around the idea that my niece could catch the flu from them. I have suggested precautions such as ensuring my niece washes her hands after playing with the chickens, but this doesn't assuage her concerns.  \nWhile I deeply care for my sister and want my home to be a comfortable space for her and my niece, I feel it's unjust for her to try and dictate my choice of pets. After several months of back and forth on this, I finally lost my patience and told her, \"My chickens are here to stay. They're an integral part of my life. If you can't handle that, you're not obliged to visit.\"  \nThis has led to her refusing to bring my niece over. Even my parents have stepped in, accusing me of prioritizing my chickens over family. I don't wish to damage my family relationships, but I can't agree with my sister's attempt to force me to abandon pets I love and maintain responsibly.  \nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for firmly stating that my chickens aren't leaving?", "created_utc": 1690021416, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156gf7z/aita_for_telling_my_sister_my_chickens_arent/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think your sister is jealous.", "NTA it's not your job to play into your sister's irrational fears.
