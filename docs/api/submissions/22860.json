I'm thinking especially for my son who is the same age, as I only really have a couple of years before he will likely go off to University. My husband is going to talk to my step son and explain, he is going to plan a trip in the country with my step son which he gets to dictate (he can choose if it's just him and my husband or all of us, where we go etc.). I am doing this all guilt free - the comments which seems to assume I am just trying to exclude my step son or whatever are just wrong, I know that everyday I turn up for this kid, I have sacrificed so much and done as much as I can, and I can't keep pouring from an empty cup.****\n\nEdit for clarification: I live in Europe. Also we now intend to talk to my step son about the holiday, and not keep it a secret. \n\n\nSo I saw a similar post the other day and they got incredibly bashed!

His bio son who is a teenager, my bio son who is the same age and then two young children we have together.\n\nWe share contact of my step son with his mom. His son has Autism with ODD/PDA traits. He has a tendency to become verbally aggressive with us and the other children. He's in therapy and gets treatment, however we still have regularly outbursts and meltdowns, especially if things don't go his way/ he perceives someone else is getting their way/ he needs to share anything - even driving long distances are now avoided as they can trigger him.\n\nWe try really hard to accommodate his needs. Up until this point we have only ever holidayed domestically, as even the idea of trying to go on an abroad holiday is so daughting. Even our domestic holidays have been horrendous, always having to leave something early or actually be asked to leave by staff because his behaviour. For example we recently went to play ice hockey (his favourite thing) and he didn't putt his ball, he threw his stick and cursed at a member or staff. We had to leave and my son was really upset about it. \n\nI have actually taken my kids on holiday with family abroad once so they at least get that experience. Anyway, fast forward to now. I've received a nice amount of money for us and can afford to do a mini break abroad for 3 nights, with me, my husband and my son and our two little ones. Me and my husband chatted and decided not to take our step son because it will just mean 3 days away, walking on eggshells, and arguments. I wouldn't want to take the kids alone as the little ones can be hard work.\n\nInstead I suggested to my husband to take his son away when we come back, just the two of them together. Or alternatively we all go to a caravan at the end of the summer holidays, whatever step son prefers. Our plan is to not tell my step son. \n\nMy step sons mom has heard about this, and is very angry at me, and has basically branded me as an evil step mom, which is upsetting. But I honestly see no other way around this. Unless we just drag him along and the all kids have a miserable time? Or we just conceed and go on holiday domestically, but I feel my children are just missing out on the experience of abroad holidays and experiencing other cultures (and me too! I've only been abroad once!). \n\nMy husband now wants to cancel and instead just do something domestic with them all. I feel deflated and stood my ground.

It\u2019s not only about the trip.\n\nAutism+ODD plus what you described (whole family being kicked out of activities or deprived of normal events etc) means that your other kids are NOT having a nice childhood. (Source: having a ND sibling) \n\nThey absolutely deserve some fun time alone, abroad or not. NTA for wanting this one vacation without the 15 year old.\n\nAlso, talking about the regular daily settings, other kids should not suffer because of the 15 year old. If he misbehaves (I\u2019m not blaming the boy for this as only your family knows the extent of his condition), then you should come up with an alternative solution, like your husband having a walk with the son so that he can calm down, maybe taking him for an ice cream, and other kids staying with you and continuing with the activity. \n\nPlease work on the way to make their childhoods easier and not make it all about the ND son. I am sure you are trying hard to keep the family together and to accommodate everyone. However, it can be easy to overlook 3 kids who are currently not causing issues while you have a burning fire with the 15 year old and somehow it can turn into a long-term issue if these fires keep popping up often.\n\nLying to a 15 year old is, however, weird. You could probably have handled this better. Offering an alternative (him spending some fun days with dad) is good, but would\u2019ve been better if you were upfront about it.", "The situation with the other poster was totally different in that she was basically saying that her step son wasn\u2019t family and only wanted to go with her family. You\u2019re scenario is not like that one. NTA.", "Special needs parenting takes its own brand of guts and grit. You and the rest of your kids deserve to have a vacation, especially since your stepson will be getting one with his mom at the same time. They don't get to go on that trip, right? So the truth is, everyone gets to travel. You take the neuro-typical kids and let them experience life without the danger of tantrums abroad. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI don't get this attitude that one person with special needs is allowed to damage their sibling's childhood without anyone being allowed to say \"it is fucked up that my kids don't get to travel and do fun things because one person dictates this entire household with their moods\".\n\nYour kids spend the rest of their lives having to handle an aggressive, angry and verbally abusive sibling. They deserve at least once to be put first and have a fun time without the fear of stepson ruining it. It is his behaviour that has led to him not coming on this trip, not some nebulous meanness on your behalf.\n\nI mean your only issue here is that you need to be honest with your stepson, tell him that you have a holiday planned that includes him, but that as he'll be on holiday with his mum on the week of whatever, that you will be out of the country at this time. He will find out and that will be worse.", "Nta, I understand how challenging these conditions can be. I may get bashed for this, but living with neurodiverse children myself, i can understand how knackering it is. How much planning goes into it. How you're forever on edge, making sure you keep the regulation going and have to watch for the smallest triggers. What times to go somewhere, where are there places to decompress.... And some days, it can be frustrating as hell. On top of this, there is the guilt for neurotypical children..why can't they just do stuff without all the planning? Why do they have to adapt to your other childs needs. Are you giving them enough time?.\n\nHonestly, you all need this holiday, and you need to tell him what's happening. You and your husband sit him down together. Explain that while his behaviour is a major factor, it's also due to the triggers around him that exassasibate them. \n Explain it is not his fault that he is still learning to regulate, but your other  children also need to have experiences he is not ready for yet.   Explain that hubby will take him one to one on his return as he absolutely dervses a holiday, too. But one where he can cope with the environment better and not have as many people triggering his reactions.\n Dont focus on where you are going. Focus on what husband and dad will do on their return. Ask him to help plan it as a father/son trip. Please don't cancel this trip. You all need this for respite.  Your other children also need some time. Otherwise, they could grow up resenting him for all they thongs they have missed out on or been dragged away from early. They need to have fun, too.", "NAH (except possibly his mum)\n\nIt isn't fair on the other 3 children that they miss out on experiences because of your step son.\n\nDoes your stepson understand how what he does has an impact?\n\nWill he understand why he isn't invited on this holiday?", "NTA and you've already changed your mind about lying to him, so that's good. People are going to see it as excluding him, but what you're really doing is providing your other children with a holiday that won't get cut short, while also making sure that your stepson is provided with a holiday that better suits his needs. I think you also mentioned somewhere that he's going to be on his own trip with his mother during that time, which helps.", "NTA but instead of it being branded as your fault, your husband should set that strait, not you. Also I think the idea to keep it a secret was a mistake. Of course he\u2019s going to find out and it\u2019s always better to be honest. Secrets hurt.", "INFO:  So your husband and his ex share custody of your stepson right? So that means stepson stays with his bio mom sometimes? If so, is that when the planned trip is occurring?", "I have autistic children and one NT, and I'm autistic.\n\nYou can find countless posts in this group where adult children cut off their parents because they had terrible childhoods due to their autistic siblings. Find and print them, present them to your husband.\n\nYou're not wrong. And, yes, my NT child got to do things with my husband and I that our other children didn't. She deserved it and so much more.

Don't care what other people say you should be able to have times where you go as a whole family and times where you get quality time with your kids too you have compromised continually and all you've made it so dad can spend quality time with his son aswell. \n\nYou aren't the asshole for taking on a child with special needs and wanting the best for them but whilst also trying to juggle the emotions of your own children and trying to create special memories for them too. The problem is if you don't do this now and again your children will end up resenting the other child because they feel they can't do certain things and he becomes a priority which is natural it isn't his fault or anyone's but you need to stand your ground for that exact reason. \n\nThere's a reason there are respite holidays for children with autism so that parents blended or not can have a break and focus on the other children so they don't feel left out for a few days whilst the other child has a fun time too. It's hard no one can tell you otherwise  but you are doing great.", "You are 1% the AH for refusing to tell your stepson why he's excluded.

One with autism with severe meltdowns, violence, inappropriate behaviours towards others and so forth. The other child has had his childhood impacted as a result - he's missed out on a lot, he's taken on a lot and doesn't complain. Last year, the parents took a holiday without their son because previous experience proved highly stressful for him, them and fellow travellers. They love him tremendously but they recognise their other child needs a break and some undivided attention. It's a tough situation - no parent wants to exclude their child...but people need a minute to recharge.\n\nYou're NTA. I think your reasoning is valid.", "NTA his is a completely different situation.", "NTA. But maybe separate the 'step' from it? What might you do differently if it was your ND son. All the issues for the other kids are the same, but you probably wouldn't sneak off while he was staying with another relative? Best of luck.", "Nta. Pda is just not the same as other kinds of ND. Its fair to want a break. He can learn to do better it just takes time", "Your step son does not sound easy, or like he\u2019s having a good time on these vacations. Have you asked him if he wants to come to a short trip abroad? Not what\u2019s fair, but what he would enjoy? \n\nNone of my autistic friends enjoy being overstimulated into a meltdown, and would much rather avoid situations that push them there. You don\u2019t say how old he is, but there\u2019s a huge difference between a 13 year old, who may not be able to predict triggers, and a 17 year old, who might be expected to wield a lot more agency.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re automatically an AH, it sounds like you\u2019re in a tough spot with how your family is made up. It may not be the time to take the littlest kids abroad, maybe that waits until they\u2019re big enough for one parent to handle them.", "NTA end of the day you have other children to think of\u2026 don\u2019t ruin their holiday! I bet your stepson gets to go away with his mum? Am I right? Your children have the right to go on holiday with their mum!

No way would you not go away with your children if you came into some money!", "JAM: It isnt the nicest thing to plan a trip without the son, but you can't deny the rest of your family something they want because of the actions of one. Thats punishing your whole family. The mom can easily take the son for 3 days and so something with him and when your family comes back you can take him to do something without the other 3. Whatever you do in this situation will still have negative consequences, mainly because if your kids find out it could cause resentment for the brother especially if this happens a lot. I don't believe you're evil or an asshole as a person, just in a difficult situation. You offered ways to make it up to him, and your husband the kids father agreed. Also, you know first-hand how he behaves in similar situations. idk nta", "NTA\nYour stepson can stay with his bio mom while you are gone. I understand that he has his health problems but that can't be an obstacle to your happiness. Once in awhile you can get some time to let your other children enjoy a holiday. It's not their fault as it's not yours for your stepson's behaviour. I think you should try talking to your husband about leaving him with his mom or grandparents for those 3 days. It's not much time so they can handle him. Your children might feel sad for not getting to go abroad and that's unjust to them. They deserve a proper holiday.", "Nta.

That's the evil stepmother test. \n\nI don't know who you are worried about being the AH to, actually. Society or your stepson? If you don't tell him, his mother will. Makeup trips are a great idea, as long as he has input (maybe even a camp for something he likes to do?) You could also approach it as your son needs to come to keep an eye on the little ones, and you didn't want to put him through that, soften it up a little. \n\nLots of luck, OP.

Why does she not blame your husband as well? If there's culpability to be assigned here, he's just as culpable. Why are you copping the blame for it all?\n\nFrankly, I'd have stepped back from all interactions with his ex-wife, as much as possible, and let your husband do the explaining to her, making it clear it was his decision as much as yours.\n\nIf it turns out the reason Ex-Wife blames you is that Husband has been quietly saying to her \"Yeah, well, I'd like to take Kid with us, but OP just refuses, so we can't\", then you have a bigger problem than just his ex, or this vacation.", "Not sure if this is feasible, but what about you and the three kids going on the vacation, while your husband has a small vacation with his son?", "Not Enough Information. How old is your step son? It's a bit strange to not tell one member of the family that the rest of you are going away on holiday. Given your step son's neurodiversity, that would upset him even more because it's an unexplained deviation in his daily routine. I know what post you're referring to, but this situation is not the same. ASD is no walk in the park, and I think it's healthy for the family to take a break every now and then from the responsibilities of having a neurodiverse family member.

We were discussing the DV I went through and abuse as a child (frustrated parent with an addiction took it out on me), and I mentioned how sometimes I wouldn't like... Give my mother permission slips cos she would fly into a rage about having to pay $5 for a school trip. So I'd avoid it.

Tho my sister wasn't abusive nor could be an abuser with her mental state being that if a toddler, I still had to walk on eggshells and make my decisions based off her ever changing mood. Like my mother. \n\nAgain, I'm not and nor was my therapist saying my sister could possibly have abused me or contributed to my mother abuse of me, it's the fall out AFTERWARDS tho that is very similar. The PTSD I have, stems not just from my abuse as a child, but the relationship I had to have with my sister which was to always put her needs and wants before my own, not having my own sense of real identity or expression of it. In the years I should have been developing self and what my actual sense of self identity, it was merged in with my sister's. \n\nI've been doing good within myself and the world, all 3 points your working on now, and trust you'll get there with the work and also self awareness when your doing the thing again. The asking for help/making my needs known to others is something I still do struggle with a lot, tho my friend who I have invited into my therapy for a bit of their perspective says I've been doing a lot better. \n\nAnd a big help, something I've gotten better at for sure, is learning also it's okay to bitch about shit. People can't help what they don't know, and I didn't realise that having a vent occasionally can actually get people to say hey, imma help you. That's taught me a lot that I maybe can rely on people fully. \n\nMy self reliance is toxic. I've put myself at risk due to it.", "This. I got offered the opportunity to go to respite vs holiday with my mother and sister with downs and CP. Her mental state, tho 2yrs older then I, is that of about 2-3yrs old. \n\nWould I have loved to go to the theme park? Sure I would, however with my sister that would mean only rides and stuff she could do too aka the baby rides or the very far and few slow, don't leave the ground adult ones. And that's if we even got that far, as sometimes the crowd alone or the music could send her into an absolute meltdown and there goes the whole day. \n\nYes I rathered to go to spend time with a random family, who took me to do stuff over the weekend or had a pool and made it a whole like movie and pool weekend etc. Got taken to some bday parties and had a blast even tho I was the bonus kid deal (I assume the families knew cos the party bags had my name etc, I was random to the kids more then the adults) and one particular family became more so my 'regulars' who had kids my age and older who loved me, and even took me to the huge big zoo for a rhino touching and feeding experience etc. Things I defs couldn't do with my sister with us, we did and it was amazing. I'm still in contact with them, their eldest son is my daughter's god father. \n\nMy home life was also full of abuse of me. Not just your typical neglect due to my sister being so 24hr care wise. So those moments were absolutely gold to me and precious. \n\nEven without the abuse aspect etc, us siblings of disabled or ND children, end up taking on a lot more mental pressure and load then parents expect, even those who try earnestly to balance the situation. We will almost always without any pressure capitulate to the other sibling as it's less struggle and less chance of what your looking forward to, being called off, we need the parents in our lives to outright make choices like OP and her partner are right now, not all the time, but when they do, make it count.
