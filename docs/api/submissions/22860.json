It\u2019s not only about the trip.\n\nAutism+ODD plus what you described (whole family being kicked out of activities or deprived of normal events etc) means that your other kids are NOT having a nice childhood. (Source: having a ND sibling) \n\nThey absolutely deserve some fun time alone, abroad or not. NTA for wanting this one vacation without the 15 year old.\n\nAlso, talking about the regular daily settings, other kids should not suffer because of the 15 year old. If he misbehaves (I\u2019m not blaming the boy for this as only your family knows the extent of his condition), then you should come up with an alternative solution, like your husband having a walk with the son so that he can calm down, maybe taking him for an ice cream, and other kids staying with you and continuing with the activity. \n\nPlease work on the way to make their childhoods easier and not make it all about the ND son. I am sure you are trying hard to keep the family together and to accommodate everyone. However, it can be easy to overlook 3 kids who are currently not causing issues while you have a burning fire with the 15 year old and somehow it can turn into a long-term issue if these fires keep popping up often.\n\nLying to a 15 year old is, however, weird. You could probably have handled this better. Offering an alternative (him spending some fun days with dad) is good, but would\u2019ve been better if you were upfront about it.", "The situation with the other poster was totally different in that she was basically saying that her step son wasn\u2019t family and only wanted to go with her family. You\u2019re scenario is not like that one. NTA.", "Special needs parenting takes its own brand of guts and grit. You and the rest of your kids deserve to have a vacation, especially since your stepson will be getting one with his mom at the same time. They don't get to go on that trip, right? So the truth is, everyone gets to travel. You take the neuro-typical kids and let them experience life without the danger of tantrums abroad. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI don't get this attitude that one person with special needs is allowed to damage their sibling's childhood without anyone being allowed to say \"it is fucked up that my kids don't get to travel and do fun things because one person dictates this entire household with their moods\".\n\nYour kids spend the rest of their lives having to handle an aggressive, angry and verbally abusive sibling. They deserve at least once to be put first and have a fun time without the fear of stepson ruining it. It is his behaviour that has led to him not coming on this trip, not some nebulous meanness on your behalf.\n\nI mean your only issue here is that you need to be honest with your stepson, tell him that you have a holiday planned that includes him, but that as he'll be on holiday with his mum on the week of whatever, that you will be out of the country at this time. He will find out and that will be worse.", "Nta, I understand how challenging these conditions can be. I may get bashed for this, but living with neurodiverse children myself, i can understand how knackering it is. How much planning goes into it. How you're forever on edge, making sure you keep the regulation going and have to watch for the smallest triggers. What times to go somewhere, where are there places to decompress.... And some days, it can be frustrating as hell. On top of this, there is the guilt for neurotypical children..why can't they just do stuff without all the planning? Why do they have to adapt to your other childs needs. Are you giving them enough time?.\n\nHonestly, you all need this holiday, and you need to tell him what's happening. You and your husband sit him down together. Explain that while his behaviour is a major factor, it's also due to the triggers around him that exassasibate them. \n Explain it is not his fault that he is still learning to regulate, but your other  children also need to have experiences he is not ready for yet.   Explain that hubby will take him one to one on his return as he absolutely dervses a holiday, too. But one where he can cope with the environment better and not have as many people triggering his reactions.\n Dont focus on where you are going. Focus on what husband and dad will do on their return. Ask him to help plan it as a father/son trip. Please don't cancel this trip. You all need this for respite.  Your other children also need some time. Otherwise, they could grow up resenting him for all they thongs they have missed out on or been dragged away from early. They need to have fun, too.", "NAH (except possibly his mum)\n\nIt isn't fair on the other 3 children that they miss out on experiences because of your step son.\n\nDoes your stepson understand how what he does has an impact?\n\nWill he understand why he isn't invited on this holiday?", "NTA and you've already changed your mind about lying to him, so that's good. People are going to see it as excluding him, but what you're really doing is providing your other children with a holiday that won't get cut short, while also making sure that your stepson is provided with a holiday that better suits his needs. I think you also mentioned somewhere that he's going to be on his own trip with his mother during that time, which helps.", "NTA but instead of it being branded as your fault, your husband should set that strait, not you. Also I think the idea to keep it a secret was a mistake. Of course he\u2019s going to find out and it\u2019s always better to be honest. Secrets hurt.", "INFO:  So your husband and his ex share custody of your stepson right? So that means stepson stays with his bio mom sometimes? If so, is that when the planned trip is occurring?", "I have autistic children and one NT, and I'm autistic.\n\nYou can find countless posts in this group where adult children cut off their parents because they had terrible childhoods due to their autistic siblings. Find and print them, present them to your husband.\n\nYou're not wrong. And, yes, my NT child got to do things with my husband and I that our other children didn't. She deserved it and so much more.

Don't care what other people say you should be able to have times where you go as a whole family and times where you get quality time with your kids too you have compromised continually and all you've made it so dad can spend quality time with his son aswell. \n\nYou aren't the asshole for taking on a child with special needs and wanting the best for them but whilst also trying to juggle the emotions of your own children and trying to create special memories for them too. The problem is if you don't do this now and again your children will end up resenting the other child because they feel they can't do certain things and he becomes a priority which is natural it isn't his fault or anyone's but you need to stand your ground for that exact reason. \n\nThere's a reason there are respite holidays for children with autism so that parents blended or not can have a break and focus on the other children so they don't feel left out for a few days whilst the other child has a fun time too. It's hard no one can tell you otherwise  but you are doing great.", "You are 1% the AH for refusing to tell your stepson why he's excluded.

One with autism with severe meltdowns, violence, inappropriate behaviours towards others and so forth. The other child has had his childhood impacted as a result - he's missed out on a lot, he's taken on a lot and doesn't complain. Last year, the parents took a holiday without their son because previous experience proved highly stressful for him, them and fellow travellers. They love him tremendously but they recognise their other child needs a break and some undivided attention. It's a tough situation - no parent wants to exclude their child...but people need a minute to recharge.\n\nYou're NTA. I think your reasoning is valid.", "NTA his is a completely different situation.", "NTA. But maybe separate the 'step' from it? What might you do differently if it was your ND son. All the issues for the other kids are the same, but you probably wouldn't sneak off while he was staying with another relative? Best of luck.", "Nta. Pda is just not the same as other kinds of ND. Its fair to want a break. He can learn to do better it just takes time", "Your step son does not sound easy, or like he\u2019s having a good time on these vacations. Have you asked him if he wants to come to a short trip abroad? Not what\u2019s fair, but what he would enjoy? \n\nNone of my autistic friends enjoy being overstimulated into a meltdown, and would much rather avoid situations that push them there. You don\u2019t say how old he is, but there\u2019s a huge difference between a 13 year old, who may not be able to predict triggers, and a 17 year old, who might be expected to wield a lot more agency.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re automatically an AH, it sounds like you\u2019re in a tough spot with how your family is made up. It may not be the time to take the littlest kids abroad, maybe that waits until they\u2019re big enough for one parent to handle them.", "NTA end of the day you have other children to think of\u2026 don\u2019t ruin their holiday! I bet your stepson gets to go away with his mum? Am I right? Your children have the right to go on holiday with their mum! I would of told him that you are going away but I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting another meltdown! All you people saying Y T A are liars! No way would you not go away with your children if you came into some money!", "JAM: It isnt the nicest thing to plan a trip without the son, but you can't deny the rest of your family something they want because of the actions of one. Thats punishing your whole family. The mom can easily take the son for 3 days and so something with him and when your family comes back you can take him to do something without the other 3. Whatever you do in this situation will still have negative consequences, mainly because if your kids find out it could cause resentment for the brother especially if this happens a lot. I don't believe you're evil or an asshole as a person, just in a difficult situation. You offered ways to make it up to him, and your husband the kids father agreed. Also, you know first-hand how he behaves in similar situations. idk nta", "NTA\nYour stepson can stay with his bio mom while you are gone. I understand that he has his health problems but that can't be an obstacle to your happiness. Once in awhile you can get some time to let your other children enjoy a holiday. It's not their fault as it's not yours for your stepson's behaviour. I think you should try talking to your husband about leaving him with his mom or grandparents for those 3 days. It's not much time so they can handle him. Your children might feel sad for not getting to go abroad and that's unjust to them. They deserve a proper holiday.", "Nta. It won't be a holiday with him there.", "INFO: If it was *any* of the 3 other children that had the same neurodivergent issues, would you leave them at home with someone else? That's the evil stepmother test. \n\nI don't know who you are worried about being the AH to, actually. Society or your stepson? If you don't tell him, his mother will. Makeup trips are a great idea, as long as he has input (maybe even a camp for something he likes to do?) You could also approach it as your son needs to come to keep an eye on the little ones, and you didn't want to put him through that, soften it up a little. \n\nLots of luck, OP. I have never stood in your shoes.", "I sympathize, but YTA for \"*Our plan is to not tell my step son*\".\n\nThat was always going to be a shitty plan.

It's not clear whether the idea to exclude him was yours or his, but you say \"*Me and my husband chatted and decided not to take our step son*.\"\n\nSo he knew and approved. **He** was all in favor of the plan to go abroad without your stepson, yet his ex-wife has branded **you** the evil stepmom? Why does she not blame your husband as well? If there's culpability to be assigned here, he's just as culpable. Why are you copping the blame for it all?\n\nFrankly, I'd have stepped back from all interactions with his ex-wife, as much as possible, and let your husband do the explaining to her, making it clear it was his decision as much as yours.\n\nIf it turns out the reason Ex-Wife blames you is that Husband has been quietly saying to her \"Yeah, well, I'd like to take Kid with us, but OP just refuses, so we can't\", then you have a bigger problem than just his ex, or this vacation.", "Not sure if this is feasible, but what about you and the three kids going on the vacation, while your husband has a small vacation with his son?", "Not Enough Information. How old is your step son? It's a bit strange to not tell one member of the family that the rest of you are going away on holiday. Given your step son's neurodiversity, that would upset him even more because it's an unexplained deviation in his daily routine. I know what post you're referring to, but this situation is not the same. ASD is no walk in the park, and I think it's healthy for the family to take a break every now and then from the responsibilities of having a neurodiverse family member.

If husband refuses, then maybe see if you have a good friend that will like to go with you so you can have an extra pair of eyes of the young two.  \n\nYou and the other children shouldn't have to live around your stepson's needs and wants all the time.", "If the kids miss out on experiences because of their brother they will grow to resent him (if they don\u2019t already). You shouldn\u2019t lie to him, and the dad taking him on a seperate trip afterwards sounds like a great compromise.", "NTA then. \n\nI think some of our American friends may judge you badly due to the only been abroad once comment. \n\nIt takes me 2 hours to \u2018go abroad\u2019 from where I am but, to many Americans that doesn\u2019t even mean they\u2019ve left their state. \n\nI don\u2019t know many adults who haven\u2019t been abroad from where I\u2019m from \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think you can find a way to ensure he feels equally loved.

(Someone mentions your son's age as 15 but I don't see this in the post ?) Only suggestion I would add is replicating the family vacation with yourself, your husband, and your step son. That way all the children receive the same attention (both the attention of their parents while on vacation).", "No, I already said what you need to do. If you can't do that then shut up.\n\nChildren need accountability, it's even possible telling them their behavior was a deciding factor they may even look inward.\n\nWhat you want to do is just lie.\n\nI'm more interested in why this kid who clearly has issues hasn't had professional help. To me it sounds like all the adults in their life have failed them, including you.", "[deleted]", "Yes I should have clarified in my post. I live in the EU and for me going abroad is a 50 minute flight, or a 3/4 hour drive.", "Are you ok? Because you sound like you think all of the kids need to be treated equally no matter what their needs are instead of equitably. \n\nThe other kids deserve to have experiences where not everything is dictated by how OP\u2019s stepson is reacting/feeling. \n\nOP\u2019s stepson deserves to have experiences modified to his ability to process them. Traveling internationally is stressful at the best of times, let alone with younger siblings. He shouldn\u2019t be forced into a situation that is setting him up for failure. \n\nAs long as it\u2019s discussed with him in advance and he gets significant input on his trip with his dad, the needs and abilities of everyone are being considered. \n\nTo require that none of them can have an experience unless all of them can, even ones they know will trigger meltdowns will cause resentment in the other three kids and is ableist against the stepson.", "Thank you for this, I\u2019m also from Europe and I don\u2019t think I ever met a person who\u2019s never been abroad, even the poorest ones.

Most of my kids friends have been abroad.", "American here, I would argue the long flight to go abroad would be even more reason to not bring the stepson.  Not much you can do if he has a meltdown while you\u2019re flying over the Atlantic. (I agree with your comment, though.)\n\nNTA.", "What is your problem man? Your commenting on every comment basically saying I'm evil. Why? Just leave your one mean comment and let me ignore you, you have nothing valuable to add to any of this.", "She doesn't want us to take him, she is just mad we are going on a trip without step son.", "I don't agree with replicating the vacation. Sometimes life isn't fair. SS is going on holiday with his mother during that time. He does get a holiday. \n\nBut telling him is a good idea, OP, and yes he's going to get upset. Constantly shielding him from upset doesn't do any of you any favors. He has to learn to regulate those emotions, not just avoid them. At this point I think you can go in knowing he's going to be upset, but knowing as well that he's stop eventually and you guys love him enough to help him work through it.", "The kid has ODD so bad behaviour is part of his disorder, looking inward won't change that", "I did write in my post: he has therapy and treatment for his issues.

You really think that makes it better?", "My problem is you being an evil person. And I don\u2019t care about it being valuable. I want you to know how evil you are.

Our lives dont stop because kiddo is in your care.", "Just to elaborate: My suggestion is not just based on fairness to the child but fairness to the parents. They're in this together.
