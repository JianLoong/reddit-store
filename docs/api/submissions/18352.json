{"id": 18352, "submission_id": "13tswk0", "title": "AITA for confronting my cousin about stealing my dress the night before her wedding?", "selftext": "I\u2019m (27f) getting married later this year and announced a tentative date a while ago. Seemingly out of no where, my cousin (28f) decided to get married exactly one week before I was planning to. \n\nI have been trying on wedding dresses for the past couple months. My cousin\u2019s mother asked to see some of the dresses I had tried on so my mother sent her a video of one of our final picks. I didn\u2019t think much of it as I wanted my extended family to feel included. \n\nA few weeks pass and I get a call from the boutique I had paid a deposit for my dress at. They inform me that my cousin and her mother had come to their store with the video of me in my dress and asked to get something exactly like it. One of their sales associates sold them the exact same dress in a cream colour instead of white (which was my dress\u2019s colour). The store owner was very apologetic and offered a refund since she realized two girls from the same family can\u2019t wear the same dress\u2014I will likely have a lot of the same guests at my wedding. \n\nI was in disbelief and was hoping it was all a terrible mix up. I immediately messaged my cousin and casually asked to see the dress she purchased. For weeks she created stories about either not finding a dress or having it altered so she couldn\u2019t show me. Finally, the night before her wedding, she invited my mom and I over for some last minute help. \n\nAgain, we asked to see her dress. She finally caved and brought it out. Of course, it was the exact same dress. I was extremely hurt and asked why she would go out of her way to steal my wedding dress knowing full well her wedding is before mine which means everyone would see it on her before me. I said if she had spoken to me beforehand I might have chosen to let her have the dress but she went behind my back and chose to lie about it repeatedly. \n\nThings got heated and I ended up leaving. I\u2019m not sure if I even want to go to her wedding tomorrow after the stunt she and her mother pulled. Everyone in my family thinks I overreacted and should have kept my mouth shut until after her wedding instead of creating animosity the night before her big day. \n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nHopping on to answer a few frequently asked questions:\n\n- I accepted the refund and will be wearing a different, much more fabulous dress to my wedding. \n\n- My original post mentioned that the wedding date I announced was tentative. When my cousin went ahead and booked her wedding exactly a week before mine, I changed my date because it would be far too inconvenient for our family and friends to arrange clothes, transportation, hair/makeup, etc. back to back. \n\n- Some commenters think I should have confronted my cousin the second I found out about her stealing my dress\u2014I did, but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt by having a conversation first. She dodged showing me her dress for weeks, but by that point I had already returned my dress. I was only going to say something after I confirmed she did, in fact steal my dress. I didn\u2019t want to make a scene if it turned out she didn\u2019t actually copy me. \n\n- To the commenters saying it\u2019s \u201cjust a dress\u201d\u2026 my cousin will likely be sending her wedding photos to everyone in our extended family. At least 50% of my guests will be the same as hers so they definitely would have noticed if we wore the same dress and I would look like the imitator. \n\n- As much as I\u2019d love to show up wearing the same dress to her wedding, I would definitely be exacerbating this whole ordeal. I should have known that after changing my wedding date to accommodate my cousin, she would have assumed I would accommodate all her other bs too. \n\n- I didn\u2019t mention this in the original post as I wanted unbiased answers, but my cousin and her mom have copied me my whole life. Whether it\u2019s buying similar clothes, copying my style, etc. They NEVER compliment me yet copy everything I do. I wasn\u2019t the one who sent them the video of my dress, my mom did. She assumed there was no way they would ever copy my dress. \n\n- The cousin and her mom are from my dad\u2019s side of the family. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s why my mom isn\u2019t making as big of a deal as she should.", "created_utc": 1685253884, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13tswk0/aita_for_confronting_my_cousin_about_stealing_my/", "score": 3972, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

EVERYONE knows how important the wedding gown is to a bride.\n\nWhat they did is so sneaky and spiteful my jaw was open as I was reading it.

That tells you something!\n\nJust because people are on your family tree doesn't mean they can be in your life and just act any old way.

I do hope you have an even nicer dress now.\n\nThis was a deliberate act from a jealous and petty individual and her mother - I mean, enabling the pettiness is just as bad as doing it on your own.

It depends on how petty you want to be.\n\nI'm not sure if I'd go to her wedding, but I'd spend the week working out a way to roast her in my wedding speech.

The only thing maybe op could have handled differently was timing but it was beyond an AH thing to get the same exact dress; so I feel she was entitled to handle it whenever she wanted. How do you have zero individuality that you copy a dress?", "If there is any rivalry, it is definitely one sided. We were never too close growing up despite going to the same high school. I always felt she didn\u2019t like me very much and avoided communication with me unless absolutely necessary. From my end, I always tried to make an effort with her but since growing up and realizing how weird our dynamic is, I stopped making as much of an effort. We really only speak/see each other at family events and get togethers.", "I had this thought, too. But ultimately, I don't think it would be worth the drama it would cause. OP is NTA but I'd want peace in my life more than the petty BS", "My mom thinks I should have been the bigger person and not stoop to their level. She thinks by giving them a reaction I\u2019ll be painted as the villain. She is very non-confrontational and thinks everything should be dealt with quietly behind closed doors. Normally, I would agree, but I was in shock because I never expected such close family to screw me over like this deliberately. It makes me think they were never happy for me and did all of this out of jealousy or spite. I might be overthinking it because my emotions are running high.", "Side note the boutique is majorly to blame here as well. They owe you more than a refund and an apology for the time you\u2019ve lost.", "To steal the attention she would get from\nfamily", "Don\u2019t invite them to your wedding or change your dress.

How awful! \n\nAny chance you can ruin her dress lol because what\u2019s the point in compensation so close to your own wedding?", "Honestly, I feel like your emotions are on par with the situation. What they did was sneaky, spiteful, and nasty. And while I tend to agree with your mom on handling things privately, I think this is one of the few exceptions to the rule. I mean, it sounds like your cousin is not only jealous of you announcing your wedding before her, but that that she also had to make this special time all about her instead of sharing the spotlight with you by having her wedding the week before yours. I feel like it could have been a special moment for the two of you to share this time together, but it was ruined.", "Being the bigger person usually means have no boundaries and/or enable the behaviour. Not going to the wedding would just be a boundary. And a consequence for your cousin (but I doubt your family would like consequences...) You might even set up the boundary to uninvite everyone who didn't have your back. Because why would they deserve to be there if they think you are the AH in this for voicing anger at being mistreated?", "I really can\u2019t blame the boutique. They were simply helping another customer find what they wanted. Apparently the sales associate who sold my cousin the dress had no idea we were from the same family which is very understandable.

Don't go to her wedding, rescind their invitation and extend the same courtesy to every single person who gives you shit. Do tell them that if they don't stop bothering you and pissing you off, they're not gonna be invited anymore and you mean it. Then the fist one who shits outside the bowl gets the door. This should settle it. \n\nAnd if this means it's gonna be just you, your parents, and your fianc\u00e9 + his family, so be it. \n\nNTA and you really don't need this kind of people in your life.", "Nta, i would be petty as hell though. Your family is already treating you like garbage about being upset so I would burn that bridge. Go to the wedding and during the ceremony, be the one that objects on the grounds that she has no moral values and her maturity level is not fit for someone getting married. If she's willing to lie, steal and stab you in the back, she certainly could do that to her future husband. Walk out right after", "NTA - I think a lot of comments have covered why Aunt and Cousin are AHs, but what about the dress shop???\n\nThey knew the situation was wrong enough to contact you and offer a refund. If they're only making one sale out of this, then surely they should have refused to sell it to the cousin. At least check OP was aware of situation as they clearly had contact info for her", "NTA. This was a calculated act. You would definitely not be an AH if you cut these people off", "Yeah no she's an asshole.

Heck yes to ALL of this!", "Count me in!", "Oh yeah, can't remember which sub I read it on, but a mother showed up to her kid's wedding in a wedding dress cos \"it was her day too!\"\n\nThere was another where I think it was an ex showed up in what was clearly a wedding dress, just in red.\n\nHonestly, given those stories, it hadn't even occurred to me that the poster was tongue in cheek.", "No, but I didn't want the 3 kids to all basically have the same name. It already confuses my mum sometimes lol. Also, my kids would have hated me if I named them those names. \n\nThink similar names for girls and boys like Julie for girl,  Julian for boy type thing.", "Julian is one of my top names for a boy (I\u2019m expecting but don\u2019t know the gender)", "Right now she is gambling on you not wearing the dress. If you look better in it than her then wear tf out of it and keep them invited. If you look about the same in it then get a new dress\nand retract their invites NTA.", "OP, I've had a toxic duo like this in my life, endlessly scheming to take everything away from me. \nA wedding a week before yours, after you had confirmed your date, is uncool at the best of times but this is clearly all about upstaging you. \nEither they are jealous or so clueless about what a beautiful bride/wedding would look like, they set this up to knock you off the pedestal. \nA realistic solution would be to have one your mates who is giving a speech (roast) crack a really funny joke eluding to the stolen dress. Someone left the ivory out in the sun, went crazy with bleach, something. Allow them to tell your entire audience what happened through a comical speech. Keep it sharp and classy and no one will think of her wedding after your brilliant day.\n\nI am really sorry that this happened to you. It's a knife in your back (shout out to the bridal shop for providing emergency tailoring to accommodate the knife in your back!). Your family need to get their priorities straight and be supportive.

You can wear it then brag to your fam about how you got a designer dress for free (just send me shipping lol).\n\nNTA.", "NTA don\u2019t go to the wedding. Why is your mom so naive if this has been happening for years?", "Sure glad that guys don\u2019t have these types of issues", "NTA, but I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t just tell her you knew she bought the same dress ages ago? I guess you wanted confirmation before accusing her\u2014but you had potential proof from the sales person literally telling you. Why did you wait to have her show you it before telling her she sucks? It feels like you wanted a big moment of drama. \n\nShe\u2019s definitely the asshole, but you are at least partially at fault for letting it go this long and doing it the night before the wedding. Unless you tried telling her the proof before hand and she lied/denied it.", "Omg what if you did a post the day before her wedding saying \u201chere\u2019s a sneak preview of the dress I\u2019ve been keeping a secret for the last few months!\u201d And then let her stew on her big day, and show up to your wedding in a new, different dress.", "lol I would have poured some fucking juice/sauce/dirt on her dress and not attend their wedding / uninvited all of them from yours.

Your aunt and your cousin planned and deliberately did this. \"When my aunt asked to see a photo of my wedding dress I didn't know the reason was so they could order the same dress for cousin to wear at her wedding. I also find it interesting that cousin didn't set a date until after I did and her date happened to be the week before mine.\" Consider adding that the bridal shop called and told you about her ordering the dress but you didn't realize your cousin and aunt valued your sense of style so much that they just had to copy you. \n\nAs a guy I'm not up on dresses, but could you add some color to yours, maybe some ribbons to match your flower colors? Maybe do something similar to your bridesmaids dresses? Or ask the bridal shop if they have any suggestions?", "She knew exactly wtf she was doing. That's why her wedding is before OP's and she stole her dress. This is sick as hell. It's like she wants to be OP! Wtaf is going on this can't be real!!!", "Agree NTA. But OP had more than a week. The store told OP \u201cweeks\u201d earlier that the cousin had bought the same dress in a different shade.

I wrote NTA.  i was referring to her cousin when i said insane, not op", "Tbh she doesnt say whether she got a new dress before she confronted the cousin: maybe she did.

So OP had WEEKS to get a different dress. The dress shop even offered a refund so OP could get a different dress.\n\nYes, the cousin's intentions and actions were despicable, but they did not change the knowledge that OP had and they did not prevent OP from immediately starting to shop for a different dress.", "The cousin lying did not erase the fact that the dress shop told OP what dress her cousin had bought.\n\nThe lying is only important as a factor in OP deciding how to deal with her cousin. She KNEW weeks earlier what dress her cousin bought, so (unlike the comment I was responding to) OP had a lot more than a week to source a different dress.", "After this I think I'd be having red wine incidents every time we were together for the rest of her life including her wedding.

What does your aunt have ti say for herself ? \n\nI would start making shit up and let her copy the ideas you have no intentions of doing.  All the guests holding candles.

I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with the drama but honestly better to be you than her. It must feel terrible to be so obsessed with someone else. \ud83d\ude02 NTA", "You are NTA for confronting her and I\u2019m so happy you have an even more fabulous dress for your wedding. \n\nPlease update your post to let us know what she says or how she and her Mom act when they see it.", "This. OP, uninvite them from your wedding. Switch your dress if you still can. I would cut these people off entirely. At most, be politely cold at events. They went out of their way to hurt you. People like that shouldn't be in your life.\n\nAnyone who thinks they should be allowed in your life needs a huge reality check.", "NTA. Work with the bridal shop to get a new dress for your wedding. Then have the first dress altered to be knee length, dye it a VERY pale colour (pink? blue?) and wear it to her wedding. If anyone asks, tell them what happened, why you couldn't use the dress for your wedding, how you didn't want it to be a waste so you had it altered to suit the event and that you figured the bride wouldn't mind since she was the once that bought the identical dress. \n\nThen cut the cake before her and her husband and cartwheel of their lives.", "Yeah, fam is trying not to \"rock the boat\" that's what!\n\nOP, skip that wedding, you don't need that noise!\n\nCut them out of your life, get another banging dress and enjoy your wedding without them!\n\nThese type of people will compete with you over anything!

Contacting the wronged bride and helping her get a new, better dress in time was the better option.", "Business is business.  You can't blame the store for this.  They're in the business of selling dresses--they shouldn't have to be required to know who's buying what dress and who that person might be friends with or related to.  There's really no reason to blame the boutique for this.  I'd say the owner went above and beyond letting OP know about it.", "AND make sure to show your receipt with the DATE YOU PAID to show you bought yours FIRST!!", "very good point", "Sorry think you misunderstood. By they I meant OPs family!", "My kind of petty. And NTA.", "I like this.", "Yes but her cousin doesn\u2019t know that. The point is that OPs cousin was trying to stick her with wearing the same dress. That was her plan.

Pour the wine on her seat so she's got a dirty ass all night :)", "NTA\n\nThis is disgusting. She\u2019s obviously jealous of you and there seems to be some animosity here. I hope you\u2019ve uninvited her from your wedding, she wouldn\u2019t be welcome at mine.", "This gives you a chance to outdo her. Since your going last, that means getting a BETTER dress, upping the decorations at the venue, just making sure everything is just that bit nicer and better than her wedding. \n\nAnd be prepared for her to make a scene at your wedding if she thinks it's going too well. Hire daurds for the day, or have family/friends watch her and ready to pull her out if she makes a fuss.", "NTA your cousin and mom knew exactly what they are going. And I hope your new dress is 1000000000000x more beautiful then hers!", "If that was my family, there would've been an accidental red wine incident prior to the cousin walking down the aisle. Those have been known to happen at weddings when someone wears white or matches the bride. The poor MOHs are just clumsy from nerves. I'm sure other guests can be just as clumsy.", ">It\u2019s not about the dress.\n\nThis! And OP is ofcourse NTA and seems like a very considerate person. \n\nAnd the  store owner ..wow...what an amazing person to do what they did...Op should should name and praise the store.", "The store called OP to acknowledge the mistake, and gave her a refund. She then got a better dress.", "You're NTA but if they have copied you your whole life... why the fuck did you show them your dress?", "In the OP's addendum, she said that the store gave her a refund and then got her an even better dress.", "I agree. If the store knew enough to call and tell OP, they k ew enough to deny the sale. Even prom dress boutiques in my area take down your highschool name so they don't sell the same dress to two girls. So denying a sale for this reason isn't unusual.", "Heh \u201ctwining\u201d has a very different connotation than \u201ctwinning\u201d.   Damn autocorrect!", "Dude, that\u2019s for someone wearing white to your wedding.   Hitting someone\u2019s wedding dress with red wine is pretty unhinged.", "No, never go the lowest path. You were classy, so stay classy.", "OP needs to watch this cousin around her soon to be husband. She wants to *be* her. I wouldn't turn my back.", "I believe OP said that she'd already moved her wedding date to accommodate the guests who'd have had to travel twice in a short time, because her copycat cousin scheduled her own wedding to occur right before OP's wedding.", "You missed the point. Yes, the owner warned OP. The cousin revealed her true intentions by continuing to lie to OP so OP would not know until after the cousin\u2019s wedding. She was forced to reveal her plot. She didn\u2019t want to.", "very good point", "With what cousin did, I wouldn't go to her jealous ass wedding.  Since the family believes everything lie she tells the heck with them too.  Lies eventually come out and the believers will have egg on their face.", "OP did get a refund from the bridal shop, and a new dress which she calls \"even more fabulous\". She simply wanted to know how far would the cousin take the deceit.", "The owner called OP. The salesclerk did a bad job by selling the dress.", "Thank God for ethical people at the bridal shop!", "Wedding dresses can take the better park of a year to arrive after you pay for them, and require fittings. It\u2019s hard to get a dress in a week. OP already has her new one but isn\u2019t getting married until later in the year. The cousin was clearly trying to ensure OP didn\u2019t have time to get a new one after the cousin\u2019s wedding.", "Your mom wants you to be a doormat. Don\u2019t. Also, why would she send them that video knowing how jealous and spiteful they are? You say they try to mimic you in everything. She must know that. Maybe she is also feeling guilty about her role in the situation and wants it to just go away quietly.\nI would be livid with my mom.", "*After* her wedding. Do it before and the cousin and aunt will go all out to ruin her wedding. For somebody this sociopathic, I would even be wary about disinviting them.", "Cousin's behaviour is just sad. Things like this usually get around the family and she will just look like an AH.\n\nIt's probablly best if OP just cuts this cousin off, but if I were OP + feeling a bit petty, I would schedule some engagement photos for the day of the wedding. I would get super dolled up for the photos and come to the wedding later that day with some stunning professionally done makeup, hair and something gorgeous (not white.) I'd make sure that my fiance and I both look like superstars (for the photos) while still following all social etiquette guidelines. \n\nThis way, she can't play the victim at all. OP can still play the family game if she wants to (it's easier said than done sometimes to go LC or NC) And, she can look viciously fabulous while seeing the rest of my family that she actually likes."]}
