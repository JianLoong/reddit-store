Seemingly out of no where, my cousin (28f) decided to get married exactly one week before I was planning to. \n\nI have been trying on wedding dresses for the past couple months. My cousin\u2019s mother asked to see some of the dresses I had tried on so my mother sent her a video of one of our final picks. I didn\u2019t think much of it as I wanted my extended family to feel included. \n\nA few weeks pass and I get a call from the boutique I had paid a deposit for my dress at. They inform me that my cousin and her mother had come to their store with the video of me in my dress and asked to get something exactly like it. One of their sales associates sold them the exact same dress in a cream colour instead of white (which was my dress\u2019s colour). The store owner was very apologetic and offered a refund since she realized two girls from the same family can\u2019t wear the same dress\u2014I will likely have a lot of the same guests at my wedding. \n\nI was in disbelief and was hoping it was all a terrible mix up. I immediately messaged my cousin and casually asked to see the dress she purchased. For weeks she created stories about either not finding a dress or having it altered so she couldn\u2019t show me. Finally, the night before her wedding, she invited my mom and I over for some last minute help. \n\nAgain, we asked to see her dress. She finally caved and brought it out. Of course, it was the exact same dress. I was extremely hurt and asked why she would go out of her way to steal my wedding dress knowing full well her wedding is before mine which means everyone would see it on her before me. I said if she had spoken to me beforehand I might have chosen to let her have the dress but she went behind my back and chose to lie about it repeatedly. \n\nThings got heated and I ended up leaving. I\u2019m not sure if I even want to go to her wedding tomorrow after the stunt she and her mother pulled. Everyone in my family thinks I overreacted and should have kept my mouth shut until after her wedding instead of creating animosity the night before her big day. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685253884, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13tswk0/aita_for_confronting_my_cousin_about_stealing_my/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If her actions are obviously wrong to me then it\u2019s pretty bad.", "NTA. She lied and avoided confrontation for weeks. Your reaction was valid in my eyes.

Your aunt and your cousin have a very low set of values and misplaced sense of competition.  In other situations, I would usually side with keeping the drama low with the bride, but your cousin and her mother started creating the drama by 1) scheduling the wedding on a date closely to yours and 2) selecting the same wedding dress as yours.  I'm happy that the dress shop informed you of the duplicate sale (it's a shame that they weren't able to cancel the second sale to your cousin).  \n\nPlease, when/if you and your partner decided to have kids, don't share any potential baby names until the ink is dry on on the birth certificate.", "You are NTA.

You attempted many times to either talk to her about changing her dress or you changing yours in PLENTY of time for both of you to have different dresses. \n\nIt would be one thing if they tried on the same dress by accident and fell in love with it, but it sounds like she is trying to show your other family members that you can have your accomplishments, but she can do it better because you two are close in age. Not sure why she feels competition, but that's what it sounds like. Or that her mom is competing with yours and trying to show the family she did better.

It\u2019s 100% justifiable if you skip, especially with the way your family is reacting over the situation. They realize that your aunt and cousin maliciously went to the same place, showed them your dress, and purchased the same one ON PURPOSE, right?

Stay home.\n\nShe flat out purposely bought your dress. I'm sure she claims to love you but that is spite. It really is unforgivable IMO", "NTA\n\nYou are not over-reacting.  EVERYONE knows how important the wedding gown is to a bride.\n\nWhat they did is so sneaky and spiteful my jaw was open as I was reading it.  STRANGERS phoned you because even though they are in that industry they were shocked that the family would do that.  That tells you something!\n\nJust because people are on your family tree doesn't mean they can be in your life and just act any old way.  You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.  \n\nYou didn't create animosity.  She did.  I'm sorry but your family is off in their thinking.  If she wanted a peaceful big day then she shouldn't have been creating drama.\n\nIt's totally up to you to decide what you want to do, but you are justified in being upset.", "No, not an over reaction and thank goodness the sales lady got in touch straight away. I do hope you have an even nicer dress now.\n\nThis was a deliberate act from a jealous and petty individual and her mother - I mean, enabling the pettiness is just as bad as doing it on your own. I am sorry you have such people in your life. However, think of the lonely you saved on a wedding gift.\n\nNTA and enjoy your wedding day", "Dude, you should not go. You are NTA. I would have spilled wine down the front when viewing. Your cousin and aunt are unoriginal and gross.", "NTA but you probs want to cut them off. they have no respect for you at all.", "Go find a new dress/gown and let be your cousin and aunt are TA.     Don\u2019t waste time and effort on people who are so obsessed they literally have to copy your dress.   \n\nI hope you find something better\nYour cousin I hope she has the marriage she deserves since it seems she had just rush to beat you", "NTA. Everyone needs to know what she did.", "NTA obviously.\n\nThough if your dress is ready and you're willing to unveil it early you could always do the taboo thing of wearing it to her wedding.\n\nSeeing how she's willing to share the dress, why not share the dress?\n\nThough you do run the risk of the situation escalating. It depends on how petty you want to be.\n\nI'm not sure if I'd go to her wedding, but I'd spend the week working out a way to roast her in my wedding speech. Thank her for beta testing the pattern and project the correspondence from the bridal store to show that she stole it.", "I would go and do a speech at her wedding then have a video of you in the wedding dress playing behind you of sorts and the message from the shop you got it from. But I\u2019m petty. Definitely NTA and cut her off asap and your aunt. F**k that sh*t show of a family.", "NTA, also imagine if the dress store has not told her and offered a refund? \n\nNot only did cousin refuse to take credit for stealing the dress but she also tried to trap OP.\n\nThinking about it why the heck would she plan her wedding 1 week before another family members wedding anyway??", "I'd straight up wear the dress too...", "Exactly! The only thing maybe op could have handled differently was timing but it was beyond an AH thing to get the same exact dress; so I feel she was entitled to handle it whenever she wanted. How do you have zero individuality that you copy a dress?", "If there is any rivalry, it is definitely one sided. We were never too close growing up despite going to the same high school. I always felt she didn\u2019t like me very much and avoided communication with me unless absolutely necessary. From my end, I always tried to make an effort with her but since growing up and realizing how weird our dynamic is, I stopped making as much of an effort. We really only speak/see each other at family events and get togethers.", "I had this thought, too. But ultimately, I don't think it would be worth the drama it would cause. OP is NTA but I'd want peace in my life more than the petty BS", "My mom thinks I should have been the bigger person and not stoop to their level. She thinks by giving them a reaction I\u2019ll be painted as the villain. She is very non-confrontational and thinks everything should be dealt with quietly behind closed doors. Normally, I would agree, but I was in shock because I never expected such close family to screw me over like this deliberately. It makes me think they were never happy for me and did all of this out of jealousy or spite. I might be overthinking it because my emotions are running high.", "Side note the boutique is majorly to blame here as well. They owe you more than a refund and an apology for the time you\u2019ve lost.", "To steal the attention she would get from\nfamily", "Don\u2019t invite them to your wedding or change your dress. Also stop giving them information or go to her wedding and do something to ruin the day. I can think of many petty things that would get under her skin.", "Yeah that\u2019s definitely odd to go out of her way to get the exact same dress as you. How awful! \n\nAny chance you can ruin her dress lol because what\u2019s the point in compensation so close to your own wedding?", "Honestly, I feel like your emotions are on par with the situation. What they did was sneaky, spiteful, and nasty. And while I tend to agree with your mom on handling things privately, I think this is one of the few exceptions to the rule. I mean, it sounds like your cousin is not only jealous of you announcing your wedding before her, but that that she also had to make this special time all about her instead of sharing the spotlight with you by having her wedding the week before yours. I feel like it could have been a special moment for the two of you to share this time together, but it was ruined.", "Being the bigger person usually means have no boundaries and/or enable the behaviour. Not going to the wedding would just be a boundary. And a consequence for your cousin (but I doubt your family would like consequences...) You might even set up the boundary to uninvite everyone who didn't have your back. Because why would they deserve to be there if they think you are the AH in this for voicing anger at being mistreated?", "I really can\u2019t blame the boutique. They were simply helping another customer find what they wanted. Apparently the sales associate who sold my cousin the dress had no idea we were from the same family which is very understandable. I\u2019m just glad they offered a refund at all\u2014they were under no obligation to do that for me. Fortunately we had built a nice relationship in the weeks I was there trying on dresses.", "Disengage. Don't go to her wedding, rescind their invitation and extend the same courtesy to every single person who gives you shit. Do tell them that if they don't stop bothering you and pissing you off, they're not gonna be invited anymore and you mean it. Then the fist one who shits outside the bowl gets the door. This should settle it. \n\nAnd if this means it's gonna be just you, your parents, and your fianc\u00e9 + his family, so be it. \n\nNTA and you really don't need this kind of people in your life.", "Nta, i would be petty as hell though. Your family is already treating you like garbage about being upset so I would burn that bridge. Go to the wedding and during the ceremony, be the one that objects on the grounds that she has no moral values and her maturity level is not fit for someone getting married. If she's willing to lie, steal and stab you in the back, she certainly could do that to her future husband. Walk out right after", "NTA - I think a lot of comments have covered why Aunt and Cousin are AHs, but what about the dress shop???\n\nThey knew the situation was wrong enough to contact you and offer a refund. If they're only making one sale out of this, then surely they should have refused to sell it to the cousin. At least check OP was aware of situation as they clearly had contact info for her", "NTA. This was a calculated act. You would definitely not be an AH if you cut these people off", "Yeah no she's an asshole. God knows why she did this but she knew it was wrong because she was purposely deceitful about it. Does she have a history of copying you or trying to compete with you or something? NTA at all.", "\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Don't attend her wedding. Enjoy yours. And ignore any family members who try to make you feel like the bad guy. You're not", "Nobody will remember the dress so much as how the couple looked.", "NTA.  Your cousin and her mother are despicable creatures.  How could family do this to each other?  I bet your mother feels like crap for sending her videos of your dress choice, but would have no way of knowing what the aunt/cousin was going to do.  I would not be attending her wedding, and I would not hide why either.  They should be ashamed, and your family should be ashamed of her behavior as well", "Pick up the white dress from the designer and wear it to the cousin's wedding. Tell everyone that you had booked the dress long back but because your cousin stole the dress you can't wear it to your own wedding and so are wearing it to hers. This is one situation where it would be totally justified to wear a white dressing to someone's wedding.\n\n#NTA", "NTA and you have a sh*t family. She STOLE your idea for a dress", "NTA\n\nAnd since the boutique warned you and offered a refund,  I hope you changed your wedding dress to something even more beautiful. \n\nI hope your wedding is wonderful, don't let these spiteful relatives spoil your special day.", "NTA.\n\nAsk these \"relatives\" if they want to see real animosity.  Because you can send a public message saying: Hopefully, for the groom, she isn't a lying and backstabbing wife.", "NTA at all.  I'd recommend wearing your wedding dress to her wedding.  Or just skipping her wedding altogether and being done with her.  But definitely don't change your dress.  If people comment on the similarity, tell them exactly how that happened.", "NTA, my petty ass would go and tell everyone who says what a beautiful bride is something along the lines \"I know and that amazing dress I bought months ago for my own wedding she went to shop behind my back after tricked my mom to show her. I guess copying is sincerest form of flattery!!!", "Go to the wedding and Carrie her during the vows, fuck this person", "NTA no doubt", "NTA and nah sis, please rain hellfire on your cousin\u2019s wedding day and uninvite that thieving cow from your special day.", "NTA if the wedding hasn\u2019t happened yet. Wear your dress and take some photos can\u2019t wait to wear this next week and post all over social media.", "NTA", "Fuck this noise. Don't attend her wedding. I hope your parents and siblings skip the wedding as well. Don't send a gift. When other family members ask why you aren't there, copy paste this reddit post and send it to them.\n\nNTA.", "Hope you find a new dress you love !!", "Show up to her wedding in the same dress. If she wants to play, then play fair.", "Yeah! Not only that but her wedding is before OP's anyway, so if she wanted the dress she'd have the dress anyway because everyone would see her first. If she was gonna pull this stunt, she should've at least told OP so she could've gotten a new dress: a week before her wedding isnt a lot of time to find a dress and make adjustments :/ (her actions are petty either way, but c'mon! Shes pretty much forcing OP to look like she copied her after she stole her dress). NTA!!!", "NTA- wtf?!? They don\u2019t want you to attend the wedding but you\u2019re allowed to work it?!? If she thinks 21 is a child, tell her it\u2019s irresponsible to have a child in charge of 40 other children and decline.", ">Please, when/if you and your partner decided to have kids, don't share any potential baby names until the ink is dry on on the birth certificate.\n\nTwo of my cousins were in a situation like this where one stole the other's baby name! They were pregnant at the same time, and one had the name picked out first but the other gave birth before her and just stole it. Definitely something to wary of", "Or if you are feeling petty,  leak a believable but rejected name.  I wouldn't go as far as a name that will set the kids up to fall or be bullied. \nJust something that you can go,  excellent choice we considered that but....", "They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but damn, copy cat stole your dress. Id be tempted to have a small squirt gun filled with red wine in my purse.", "If the shop didn\u2019t know you were from the same family when they sold it, then how did they think to call and tell you about it?  How did they figure out you were related?"]}
