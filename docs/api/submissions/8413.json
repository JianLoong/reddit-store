This piece alone would have me at \"hell no\":\n\n>unfortunately I found out from other family members that they discussed our finances with them,\n\nThey've shown they can't be trusted, and while financial information isn't protected the way health information is (to the best of my knowledge), it should absolutely be treated as confidential by anyone professional.", "NTA. Purely because they discussed your finances with someone. This was a breach of confidence and was highly unprofessional. If you feel you can't trust them then using them, or not, is your choice.", "NTA\n\nYour PIL crossed the line calling your realtor without talking to you and is trying to insert themselves in the process. You can politely indicate that you will not be bringing them on visits, and only when you are ready, will they see the house or if you need their advice.\n\nThey also shared your personal financial information, which is almost 100% against company policy and privacy laws. You can gently remind them of their obligations to not gossip about information provided to them during their job as a mortgage broker. If they protest, tell them you expect them to be more professional.", "NTA You tried using them in the past and you got burnt. The only benefit of using them is to avoid upsetting them, but that's not actually a benefit to you. It's just a way of trying not to rock the boat.\n\nEven if they could provide some specific benefit, by getting you a better deal on something, the fact is that they went behind your back to try to stick their nose in your business. That means they don't respect your choices. And you don't want someone who doesn't respect your choices doing business on your behalf.", "NTA. They had no right to share your personal information, especially with other family members and they had no right to go around you both and call your realtor. I would feel the same way. I think that you should first start with telling them how those actions made you feel and that because of this, you don\u2019t want to use them this time. If they don\u2019t see any wrong to their actions or you don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ll act professional and accept your boundaries then absolutely!", "NTA but you have a partner problem as much as a PIL problem.", "NTA. They shared your private information with other people, and they went behind your back to a realtor.  Not only should they not interfere with your major life decision, but their professional integrity is very much in question.\n\nShow this thread to your partner so they can see this is not normal. The PIL are overstepping big time", "NTA. Your concerns are valid. Tricky to navigate as this has been your partner\u2019s process for years. Important for you to set boundaries and for you and your partner to decide together the best way to proceed going forward. PIL feelings may be hurt, but in the long run they need to respect your wishes and your autonomy", "NTA. Your PIL HAS crossed several boundaries, it's simply NOT acceptable or professional to treat anyone so disrespectfully.  Their judgement and actions have been so poor that they are not a good fit for you to use in any professional capacity, even if you actually wanted to.  This person has shown you their true self - whether it's intentional or just a thoughtless characteristic. Let them 'go' with kindness, in consideration for your partner and the family ties; but this is not something to be ignored or avoided  - because it WILL continue to happen in other circumstances unless you reestablish that boundary!", "NTA - I understand your partner's reluctante to put their parents on the side, but they broke trust before and they seem to want to control how you handle buying a house.\n\nI'd tell them to mind their own business and never try to insert themselves into your financials plans ever again.", "NTA. My uncle used to do my taxes. Once I got married I started doing ours. My uncle does not need to know my husband\u2019s finances. We need boundaries in life.", "NTA this is a conflict of interest for them professionally and they should know better.\n\nEven if it wasn't, they've already broken your trust once and spread your financial situation about.", ">I found out from other family members that they discussed our finances with them\n\nWhere I live, this would be enough for a financial advisor to lose their accreditation and therefore, their job.  It's completely unacceptable to divulge such information to any third party, without explicit permission.\n\n>my partner does not understand this and thinks I might be being too harsh when PIL only wants to help and this would hurt them.\n\nI bet not involving PIL in your finances would not hurt as much as if you reported their indiscretion to their regulatory body?\n\nThere's no way PIL should be involved.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThey have no right to discuss your finances with anyone, it\u2018s common decency not to share such sensible information without consent.\n\nAlso, it\u2018s none of their business and they don\u2019t get to have a say in this whatsoever. You and your partner buy a home and everything about it is solely up to you.\n\nYour in-law\u2018s behavior is concerning and you should keep them at distance.", "NTA. Your PIL has broken some basic boundaries. Like telling people about your finances. Your partner is used to this kind of boundary stomping, so doesn't see the problem with the mortgage lender telling aunts, cousins, and realtors what your debt to income ratio is. Of course PIL will be hurt because they want to help, but their version of help comes with a side order of betrayal of trust. If a stranger had done this, your partner would be rightly furious. \n\nYou trusted PIL with private information. PIL did not keep that information private. PIL gossiped hither and yon, instead.\n\nIf your partner wants to keep PIL on as lenders and you decide to go along with that, make it contingent on your partner sitting down with them and making common sense boundaries explicit. You do not disclose our finances to anyone. You do not make your own arrangements with the realtor. The things that shouldn't need to be said, they need to be said.", "NTA. Do they discuss the financial privacy of all their clients? That\u2019s just beyond rude. If they ask to be in the process this time you respectfully decline because of what they did. They should already know that shit is private and shouldn\u2019t be discussed.", "NTA over involved parents need to get uninvolved", "Nope absolutely NTA. You\u2019re in laws are overstepping basic boundaries and then gossiping about personal details like your finances. That\u2019s not ok!! If a professional mortgage company or a realtor did that, they would definitely be reprimanded if not fired. It\u2019s a huge breach of confidentiality and trust!  Your SO doesn\u2019t see it like you do because they grew up thinking this type of behavior is normal, it\u2019s not. Tell them tanks but no thanks, or straight out tell them that they overstepped, broke your trust and you\u2019re going to go thru the process with someone else. Personally, I\u2019d be honest with them in hopes that behavior like this doesn\u2019t continue with them.", "NTA. Family and finances should be kept separate. It's none of their business and they've proven over and over they can't be trusted.", "NTA they disclosed your finances to family and contacted your realtor behind your back,  they are done. Your wife needs a reality check on normal boundaries.", "NTA, but you have a partner problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Have you expressed that discussing your finances makes you uncomfortable? I suspect they are proud and not intentionally doing anything  to make you uncomfortable.  EsH- pil are definitely out of bounds but you should have a friendly but firm conversation.", "NTA. It's definitely not okay for them to disclose your financial information, that you gave to them *because they were doing your mortgage*, with other family members. Huge breach of trust. Imagine if a lender you weren't related to did that. You'd report them!\n\nSo, no, you definitely don't have to use them as your lender. Be prepared that they'll be upset, though. Even if you're in the right.", "NAH. You aren't comfortable. Your PIL is just trying to help, not to pry. Your partner sounds like they would be more comfortable. Just talk it over and come to a decision. It seems to me that the best would be for you to ask if your PIL can recommend someone, but maybe they have a good reason for wanting to help\u2014like saving you on rates or doing it for low or no commission.", "NTA.

States can have tighter restrictions.\n\nETA: In the EU, the relevant law is the General Data Protection Regulation", "I think this viewpoint lacks empathy. Keep in mind partner has been raised with this type of involvement and doesn\u2019t see a problem with it as the relationship with parents was loving and meant with good intentions, just less independence than I had in my childhood. \n\nWe have communicated about this and the home buying process is paused until we come to an agreement that makes us both comfortable, but remember they are entitled to their feelings as much as I am and it doesn\u2019t make them a problem if we don\u2019t always agree.", "We have not yet. I did not find out about them talking about our finances until over a year after it happened, and it didn\u2019t seem like the best idea to bring it up as it was in the past.
