However, there are rare times when jealousy has its place, because it's perfectly justified to feel betrayed.\n\nIf she were not hiding anything, she wouldn't have raged about it not being normal to tell your partner that you are headed out on a Saturday night. Imagine if you'd said that to her at any point in your relationship. She would have flipped her shit. Anyone would, because it's totally normal to tell your partner if you're going to be out on a Saturday night.\n\nWe are all entitled to independence, even within a relationship, but it's basic courtesy to your SO to let them know what you'll be doing and with whom. If she had nothing to hide, she would have never been so defensive about it.\n\nPeople that have nothing to hide don't act like your girlfriend did. If there was nothing still going on with this guy, she would have volunteered everything you had to find out.\n\nMy best friend for over 30 years was my high school boyfriend. We were completely platonic and had our own lives after we were no longer a couple. My husband knew about him, met him, and they became friends. Until my best friend's death last year, he was a part of both our lives. That transparency existed in a very natural way that was never forced for my husband's benefit because our relationship was literally very \"what you see is what you get,\" and there was nothing sinister to see. That's how things operate when there is nothing to hide. Not whatever your girlfriend was trying to do, or has been doing.\n\nTell her not to let the door hit her in the ass on the way out. You can do better than that. You can't have love without honesty and respect, neither of which she seems capable of.\n\nEDIT a sentence", "Dude, you're not the asshole for being upset. If my girl was hanging out with some dude without telling me, I'd be pissed too. But maybe next time don't reject her in a \"smallish manner,\" just talk it out like adults.
