I love her to death, but she can be extremely selfish and has a big issue with lying. \n\nMy parents live out of state, about a 14 hour drive away. My mom made plans to drive up and take me and my bridesmaids out to brunch and then dress shopping. I asked everyone over a month in advance if they were free that day, and everyone said yes. \n\nNow that date is about a week and a half away, and my maid of honor texted me that she just realized that\u2019s the season opening for the Vikings and her and her dad like to go. She said he already bought tickets, and mentioned how they aren\u2019t cheap. Her dad is literally a millionaire and those tickets were picket change for him. His wife also is a football fan, so I simply responded, \u201cI know you like to go together, but could he go with his wife this one time?\u201d\n\nShe then said he could, but if she missed it then he would never take her to a game again. That\u2019s a lie, her dad is one of the most generous people and we\u2019ve always gotten along well. She has a habit of blaming others to try and not be the bad guy. She tried to say he wouldn\u2019t understand so she had to go to the game, again, I know this is a lie. He absolutely would understand if she told him. \n\nShe then said she \u201cisn\u2019t trying to make this about her\u201d, but asked me to move the date. I told her I can\u2019t, that\u2019s when my mom will be in the state and can be there, and all the other bridesmaids have planned around that date as well. \n\nShe told me she has to go to the game with her dad or he\u2019ll never forgive her (blatant lie). I just said \u201cI understand\u201d and we haven\u2019t spoken since, but it\u2019s only been a day. \n\nAITA for thinking she\u2019s being incredibly selfish? If I find my dress that day, then she missed her only chance at dress shopping with her best friend. I feel like that should be a higher priority than football, considering she goes to sports events all the time.", "created_utc": 1693563535, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16737uj/aita_for_being_upset_at_my_maid_of_honor/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it was just my mom and sisters, but I couldn\u2019t say for sure. I also didn\u2019t go dress shopping with the bride to be\u2019s for the 2 weddings that I was a bridesmaid for. It\u2019s important to you, yes and something to be excited about. It\u2019s not as important to anyone else, maybe family, but even then not as much. Im glad that someone gave you a reality check on that and you\u2019re actually listening. \n\nYou\u2019re still NTA, you can be upset that she\u2019s flaking on a day that was planned in advanced and lying to you. Ultimately she doesn\u2019t want to say that she\u2019d rather go to the game, then bridal dress shopping. It sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to upset you and is lying to try to prevent that. Which didn\u2019t obviously work, because you\u2019re not buying what she\u2019s selling. Personally I\u2019d call her out and say, \u201cstop lying to me and just be honest. You\u2019d rather go to the game then dress shopping\u201d. Just be prepared that she may say yes and you can share your disappointment over it, but this in itself wouldn\u2019t be a friendship ender for me.", "This day is only really important to you. They can enjoy your day with you, but thats it.", "Long as she doesn't get pissy at you for not moving the date. If she did/does then she needs to have a word with herself, it's her decision to miss the dress shopping date for her reasons, not your fault, not like you knew she was going to the game and thought I'll book it for the exact same day \ud83e\udd23 fingers crossed it goes well with your mum and everyone else who can attend\u270c\ufe0f", "I'd have a much bigger issue with the lying than the missing the date tbh. That feels almost disrespectful to me. Like others have said, whatever dress you pick is sure to be beautiful, whether or not your MOH is there, and you'll have plenty of other people there as well. It can be something of a bonding moment, for sure, because it's a significant memory for most people, but you've had and will continue to have bonding moments, probably even more significant than that. I agree that she's clearly going to attend plenty of football games with her dad, but if they do it every year, it's probably way more significant to her than you think as a long standing one-on-one father-daughter tradition.", "You know, it's always a tell when the OP packs so much extraneous information into a post only to make the other person look bad.\n\nIf you don't like your maid of honor, drop her.  It's not too late.  She's clearly not going to drop everything for you. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af", "I meant it as, if something is this important to her, then she needs to surround herself with people who think it is as well. Her friend obviously has a different take on her wedding. Why make things more difficult than they already are? Get a MOH that's on board with everything instead of fighting with someone who clearly isn't as interested as the bride would like her to be.", "i already gave my input. it's too late.", "Thank you! Your comment is really helpful", "Haha I totally get that! If she hated shopping that would be one thing, but she loves it way more than I do. Thanks for the support, I will enjoy my mom and my other friends & hopefully find the perfect dress. You have a good day too xx", "Sorry you feel that way! It\u2019s not boring at all, just my own priorities. For me, picking the dress I marry the love of my life in is a very big deal. Doesn\u2019t have to be for you! I don\u2019t want an audience, just the people I love to be there to help me make that choice \ud83d\udc96", "So you're saying if you had prior commitments you would cancel them for a game.", "Aight sorry for giving information about what happened \ud83d\ude02", "Her friend obviously has a different take on dress shopping. That's all we know.", "I think you're both tit for tat, OP. No intention to be mean here, I say it with all sympathy as I & my BFF were *just like you and your friend* are now, back when we were your age. Not that long ago, I'm 36, but still :D\n\nHer lying and blaming others for stuff she can't own up to is annoying and not the marker of a 'serious' person, but hopefully that's just immaturity. You believing that your dress shopping is an earth-shattering, mind-alterning and core-shaking experience for anyone other  yourself are funny and delusional :D \n\n(I don't understand why dress shopping is *that* important, maybe it's a cultural thing? In Europe there's no 'day' to buy your wedding dress, most people take longer than that to either buy their dress or have it sewn).\n\nYou both just happen prioritise things that aren't that important to the other, it's perhaps easier to understand this, accept it, and go around it finding ways to make it work. \n\nWait, you didn't mention your age, don't know why but I assumed 21-22 by the way you write & respond to comments. How old are you two?", "It's a big deal for you. But it is for you only. Not everybody loves wedding and everything that needs to be done for them. \n\nPicking out a wedding dress sounds boring to me. \n\nYou're going to have your mother and other women there. You don't need your MOH to be there. You just want her there. There's a difference.", "I think this is a consequence of those \"Say Yes To The Dress\" programmes. It is a special thing to choose your dress, it's a lovely experience and you'll have a great time. But I don't think it needs to be a whole bridal party affair. \n\nI had my Mum there because it was special to see her daughter in wedding dresses. The same for my MIL who was honoured I asked her to come along. I've been a bridesmaid for other people and never been asked to a dress fitting.\n\nAnyway, let your MOH off the hook for this one. She and the other bridesmaids will see you first wearing your dress on your wedding day, that's the first big emotional moment where you can all have a hug and some happy tears.", "That's not explicitly what I said; from the wording of OP's post, it's ambiguous as to which plans were made first. But since you ask, I probably would go with my dad if he offered, even if it was after I made plans to go dress shopping. And in general I think it's ok to cancel prior commitments.", "Dress shopping is one of the biggest parts because the MOH and bridesmaids' dresses usually get picked at the same time. It's how you make sure everything looks good together.", "She can do that later though. I bought my dress randomly with one of my bridesmaids (not my MOH), and then we found bridesmaid dresses later. Another friend I was a bridesmaid for just sent a few options and said \"pick one this length in this fabric\" and that was it. There are many ways to do it.", "I've only been in one wedding and we chose everything the day the bride chose her dress. Yes, there are many ways to do it. But if you have a vision for your wedding and someone isn't on board, all you're going to have is issues. This is why she needs to nip it in the bud so she can finish her wedding planning without the disappointment/ frustration/ whatever that she is going to have with this friend if dress shopping is already causing stress.", "But the bride can also nip it in the bud by adjusting her expectations. Is her wedding or her friendship more important in the long run?\n\nTen years later, I still talk to my friends who were my bridesmaids regularly. I have a photo of the four of us from that day on my dresser and recently thought how young we were and how much fun we had that day. I barely remember what the dresses looked like. I don't often think about my wedding day, but I do think about my friendships and all the things happening in their lives. \n\nBig picture...", "Different folks, different strokes. From the post, it seems like she sees her friend as flaky anyway. But now she's using her tactics to avoid wedding stuff instead of their other friends. Sometimes, there is no big picture, just realization that you've consigned someone's bad behaviors as long as they weren't directed at you."]}
