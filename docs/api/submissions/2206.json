For the most part, we\u2019ve achieved and become that. Five of us live in the house. I own it but I rent out the rooms at cheap prices ($300 to $500 a month depending on income). We live in a city where a studio goes easily for $1.7k a month.  \n\nOne person was in a shelter for some time. Another was in a nursing home (even though he is 30) and the others have just struggled with finances. \n\nWe\u2019ve become a fun space where we support each other. Teach other skills. Arrange the bus for disabled people by the city. Have events. Do gardening. We have social workers who come by. Nurses and care workers. Help housemates keep and manage jobs. \n\nIt\u2019s become a wildlife sanctuary. And it\u2019s nice to see my housemates flourish since living costs are low they can all catch up on medical costs people might not usually think are associated with autism. It helps me afford people to help clean while I work full time (dream job). \n\nI don\u2019t drive and having housemates allows me to afford a house in the city where my commute into work is 30 mins including my morning coffee.  \n\nI fell in love along the way.

Like most things - the devil is in the details. There is nothing inherently wrong about what you are planning. It has the potential to work really well.

Children are raised in mixed family/persons housing all the time, very often for much less happy reasons than a safe space for people with disabilities. Unfortunately living situations are a difficult task nowadays, you have done an awesome thing by providing safe and welcoming housing for autistic adults who may otherwise find themselves dependent or homeless; and most importantly, especially for a child, it seems to be filled to the brim with love with two parents who will protect and care for them.

The one housemate is unfortunate, they either will need to get on board with the situation or move out. If they choose the latter, you might want to offer to pay transition expenses. \n\nBeing autistic is also normal, and doesn't make you unfit parents. In fact, I think your folks might be a little bigoted... if you ask them if they think you being autistic makes you unfit,  they'll deny it (but I think this is probably the case and they are blaming their attitude on the housing situation).", "NTA.

My mother was one of those bleeding hearts people that always tried to help people and let everyone  live with  us anytime  they experienced difficulties. We were blessed that Noone touched us, but I did see alot of unnecessary  drama due to the outsiders  issues following  them to our home. The dynamics  changed each time a person left  or moved in,  and it never felt like my home when we had guest.  My house was not my safe place with different  people in it.

Moreover, there's a non-zero chance your child will also be autistic, since it's an inheritable trait. Growing up in a home with people who are understanding, compassionate, and who love and care for each other will be good for your child no matter their neurotype, and especially beneficial if they are also autistic.\n\nYour family is being judgemental, close-minded, and ignorant.

Sorry for the bluntness but I resent this comment.", "I don't necessarily think you're doing anything \"wrong,\" per se. But statistically, your parents are right. It is risky to have children around that many strangers. Other problems may arise as the result of the group of you being autistic. Children are loud, and messy, and irrational. They will disrupt things that autistic people find sensory comfort in. Of course, many autistic people are great and loving parents, and if you and your household are prepared, it will be fine. But many people, autistic or not, think they are prepared for how loud and needy and downright gross kids can be, only to be overwhelmed by the reality of the situation. The more people in the house, the greater the likelihood of causing upset. \n\nJust keep your eyes open, and be willing to put your foot down and kick out people if they cause issues, even if they are your friends. And if your child ever comes to you with any concerns, take your child's side first.", "NAH\n\nI don\u2019t think they said what they did out of malice but merely concern. It is a lot of work to raise a child but you\u2019re raising a child in a household with adults that have disabilities. Please understand that this will change the dynamics whether you all like it or not. It could be a good change, it could be a bad change, but at the end of the day it is your place and you will find out what kind of arrangement works for you. I do feel that you may one day consider a more secluded spot just for your own family since having a baby does require a lot of space and attention, perhaps the other adults with needs may distract from that. But again, if that is the case you will make the change when you\u2019re ready. For now, keep what you have and see if things can be adjusted accordingly to accommodate your baby. Giving notice to all roommates is generous anyways since they are free to stay or go.", "NTA", "NTA, this seems like a much healthier environment to raise a kid than most kids get. Your child is lucky to have you two as parents and will be lucky to grow up in a place that is positive and beautiful", "NTA.  Potentially it's an unconventional setup for some people, but if you know and trust the people you live with, then I don't think there's a problem with giving it a try.\n\nOne cool thing that popped into my head is that if your kid turns out to be autistic, they're going to grow up in a household that understands autism, and if they aren't autistic then they're going to learn about it and grow up to be an ally.  I say this because I had a late ADHD diagnosis, my sister had a late autism diagnosis, and we both feel our lives could have been different had we grown up around neurodiversity (we strongly feel our parents are AuDHD) rather than having to find out in our 40's.\n\nThe only thing I'm wondering is what would need to be considered with regards to bringing new people into the space should someone leave.  Would you need to do a background check of some type (this is more about general safety and doesn't relate to them being autistic in any way - it's a thought I'd have for NT people coming to live in the space too) before allowing them to live in a home with your child?\n\nThe dynamic might change when baby comes along (e.g. in how life with a baby might disrupt the current dynamic), but I see no harm in what you want to do, and I'm sorry that your parents aren't being supportive.  Although childless myself, I've always observed in others that it takes a community to raise a child, and by doing things your way you can bring your child in to a ready-made community with people who will love and support you all.", "NTA - Your description of the home sounded so good that it made me want to move in too! What bothered me about your parent's comment is that they called your renters, \"strangers.\" It doesn't sound like they are strangers to you. To a baby, toddler, child . .  . they will be family. I can almost visualize this child growing up to be an interesting person with a great story to tell about the people s/he calls family and the animals and fun in such a loving home.", "NTA, children FLOURISH when there are living and invested adults around them. This is such a great living situation, and just a wonderful life you\u2019ve built for yourself.", "Nta. You know you live you learn. If this doesn't work out you can adjust. I would disregard your parents and you do you. If it works out that's amazing. If it doesn't work out you can adjust and find a solution. Like maybe you move out and apply for a non profit to keep the house full and live your dream. This isn't a bad parents situation.", "NTA. You rock, OP. This kind of community housing and communal care is the absolute dream situation for so many disabled people, and we need more places like it. \n\nRe. the baby: Your roommate who doesn\u2019t want to be around a baby can move out if she wants. She is not involved in your family: you are co-housing, not asking her to co-parent. It is OK for her not to want to be around a baby, but not OK for her to tell you how you can and cannot live your lives. You have been open and honest with her and that\u2019s all she can reasonably expect. It\u2019s understandable that she\u2019s upset about having to pick between moving and living with a baby, but that isn\u2019t your problem.\n\nRe: what your parents said about your ability to raise a kid. I am a social work student about to graduate, and I have autism and work with \u201c\u201d\u201dhigh risk\u201d\u201d\u201d parents many of whom have developmental disabilities too, so I do have some knowledge on this topic. You might need some extra help, but there is no reason at all that you can\u2019t be excellent parents to this baby. The number one thing kids need is not a nuclear family, or a quiet household, or neurotypical parents. What they need is love and attention, and it sounds like there\u2019s plenty to go around in your home. \n\nI will tell you that at some point, children\u2019s aid/DCFS is almost definitely going to get involved in your lives. There really is no way around that. It might be just a quick interview, it might be an investigation, it might just be a phone call to follow up on a random report, but it probably will happen eventually. I don\u2019t say that to scare you (it isn\u2019t a bad thing) but just to make sure you\u2019re prepared. There is a lot of stigma around disabled parents and people are going to ask questions, so be aware of that and make sure you have the supports you need. \nIt sounds like you are already connected with nurses and social workers in your community. Ask what programs are available to support new parents and take advantage of all the ones you can. \n\nI\u2019m excited for you and your partner!

It's what works for them and may not look the same as some else's. That's ok and shouldn't matter at all. If it works for all of you then go for it. Parents can be set in their ways and give advice that should be not given. \n\nIt sounds like you have a great home and support system. I wish you all the best with your family.", "NTA id look into accommodations for your roommates as a fellow person with autism \n\nI would try and sound proof your makeshift nursery, and also your room so if the baby cries it won\u2019t escqpe as much\n\nI would also talk to the one roommate who doesn\u2019t want to hear the crying baby about noise canceling headphones (she\u2019ll want the industrial kind) or ear plugs \n\nMy moms not autustux but she has 6 kids that are very noisy and those have helped her sleep tremendously. You can also look into sound machines for her to keep in her room which could help drown out the babies cries \n\nI\u2019d also try and work on a routine now, and inform everyone of the routine for your baby so that way they can still enjoy living there", "NTA. My parents rented out rooms in our house. There were at least 2-3 other families in our house when I was very young. They\u2019ve become great family friends. You\u2019ll be fine. If you trust those people to cohabitate with you, you can trust them around your child.", "NTA\n\nI think it sounds amazing and you have been really good about setting everything up. There are many ways to set up a family and, while some people may still come and go, I think you're being really responsible about the household.", "NTA\n\nCongrats to you and your growing family. From the little bit I\u2019ve read it seems like you both are going to be great parents and you just seem like a good person\n\nDon\u2019t let other people try to dictate how you should live, you seem to be doing a pretty great job at it so far", "NTA\n\nMy autistic 20yr old will be a fantastic parent if they choose to have children. \n\nAnd the more people to love a child, the better. \n\nSounds like your parents need to be given bare minimum information going forward and little to no visits with your child until they can pull their heads out of their backsides. \n\nYour home sounds lovely! Absolutely lovely. So does the family you've created with your roommates.", "NTA. At all. \n\nYou did not impregnate your partner *at* your housemate. Life happens! It has nothing to do with her. It\u2019s unfortunate that a baby would make the space unlivable for her, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll give her plenty of time to make other arrangements and be cool about letting her out of her lease early. \n\nAnd raising a child in a home with a \u201cvillage\u201d of kind and supportive adults is a *wonderful* idea. They do not have to be blood relatives, chosen family can be every bit as important in a child\u2019s life. People are *far* too attached to the notion that nuclear families must form their own separate households. Your family is wrong to try and push this on you when your current arrangement works just fine. And I am deeply suspicious that their \u201cunfit parents\u201d comment is rooted in ableism. \n\nCongratulations to you and your partner on the pregnancy! Here\u2019s hoping she has a safe delivery and that you both have all the support you need. Fingers crossed that your family comes to their senses and apologizes to you soon.", "NTA\n\nYou're doing an awesome thing in your community and there is no reason you can't raise your child to be happy and healthy in the home you have created.  You may have some tenants that can't handle or deal and that's ok, they will have to find another place and you can help them relocate and help someone else who doesn't have that issue.  There is nothing in that environment that  is a danger to your child and your parent's need to get a grip.", "N A H.  First off, if one of your roommates cannot handle kids they are not a jerk for having an intense reaction and dismay.  My autistic daughter loathes children for various reasons and being around them can trigger extreme sensory overload that takes her many days to recover from.\n\nHowever, you don't owe her a perfect home either and you're contributing to such a great situation for so many and have the right to do it YOUR way.\n\nYour parents got their opinion out but now they need to back off let you and your SO make parenting choices", "NTA. Y\u2019all seem like really awesome people and I\u2019m sure will be wonderful parents.", "NTA. But you should consider that observation. Perhaps your family did not approach the subject in an adequate way, but I think they do it out of love. \nEvery person is different, and illnesses affect everyone differently.", "You created a village to help raise your child. I think this work but babies are loud and unpredictable.  How well does your roommate handle this situation?  Is there therapy to help with someone getting trained on how to deal with loud noices?", "Info: what about the lease for the roommate who doesn't want to live with a baby? \n\nThey signed a lease for a place that didn't include a child. Will their lease be up before the baby's born?", "NTA.\nI am in a slightly similar situation. \n\nI escaped a very Red state with horrible politics against my people, bought a house in a good state with resources and rights for my autistic son (raising on my own). Which also happens to be where my extended family now lives.\n\n I invited my best friend, another friend & his 13y.o. to live with me.\nThey all have Autism and other things that made them need to flee our home state.\n\nI don't have any expectations on receiving rent, because I bought the house outright and have no mortgage, (besides I don't like the idea of being a landlady.) I just need them to chip in for a third of utilities.\n\nMy family thought it was not a great idea to have \"strangers\" move in. But I explained that they were not strangers to ME or my son.\n\nBut it got better. \n\nOnce I lived near my family, they got to see us more often, and spend time with my housemates. And once they saw that they were good people, and safe for my son to be around, they understood. Also, they see now, that my friends are better and more understanding of my son's autism than neurotypical people.\n\nI think you should explain that you & your SO trust your housemates, and that this is YOUR child. Tell them to either spend the time to get to know your housemates, or keep their opinions to themselves.\n\nCongratulations on the new baby!", "'than anyone else' might be the key.\n\nentirely irrelevant to the autism aspect, there's very real examples of more adults around in community-esque family settings (and foremost statistically by a vast margin adult men, regardless of one's own personal feelings on gender dynamics) using that environment and access to abuse the children under the pretense of \"we're one big group together, all here for each other, it may not be normal but it's *our* normal\" etc etc.\n\nit'd be entirely rational for any close relatives to side-eye a plan like that for reasons utterly unrelated to the autism and solely the child's safety from abuse. even if OP really feels they know them and knows they're all good people and never would ever. that is similarly a very, very common thread in the aftermath.\n\nof course none of this is to assume any of the adults will-- but it's a risk a reasonable adult could be mindful of, again irrelevant to their autism.", "It's your house, your kid, and your plan. Bounce the roommate who doesn't want to live.", "Family members are by far the highest risk to a child. Unless you\u2019re raising your children with no other adults supervising them - such as grandparents, aunts and uncles, babysitters, friends from church, etc - (which would come with its own psychological risks to parents and children) then this isn\u2019t a higher risk situation. \n\nArguably, by having more adults immediately accessible, they can develop more safety by the child having someone to go to if they are scared to tell mom or dad.", "I think a big difference here is that you're living with the same people long-term, whereas the commenter you're replying to sounds like they grew up with a lot of short-term visitors coming and going. Living in a house share with people you know well is totally different to inviting lots of random people to stay for short periods - much safer and more stable.", "^^ this is a big thing to keep in mind as well. However carefully you vetted your roommates before, definitely step it up a notch more now that there\u2019ll be a little one around! 99% chance everything will be fine, but you always want to be aware.", "More help is always appreciated!! Especially during the first 2 years. Children need so much hands on attention, so it will be great having someone besides you and your fianc\u00e9 to help with the baby when he or she comes. Congratulations btw! \ud83d\udc76", "family members are highest risk because they have the environment and access a shitload more often than the formations of atypical family units. that in no way means the unrelated are less risk.", "It doesn\u2019t help that our families also don\u2019t get along. My family is leftist and hers is more conservative. They fight and talk for us a lot. And don\u2019t understand how both of them are steeped in ableism.", "Cosigning all of this.\nIt's not fair and you shouldn't need to do this more than any other parent, but both families sound prone to extraness.\n And cps can too frequently be ablist AF.", "No but it means that other adults existing and having autism is not a higher risk.", "There\u2019s not a court in the world that\u2019s going to take a kid away from a parent with a PhD unless you\u2019re physically abusive. Like I mentioned in another comment, you\u2019ll probably get investigated at one point or another (whether reported by family or someone else who\u2019s concerned about your atypical living arrangements), but it sounds like whoever they send to do a home visit is probably going to walk out like \u201cdamn, that\u2019s a more well-adjusted household than the one I grew up in.\u201d\n\nThere are many problems with Children\u2019s Aid/CPS/DCFS, but by and large, we don\u2019t look for reasons to pull kids out of homes. If a kid is fed and clothed and safe and loved, that\u2019s what counts. Especially recently, there\u2019s been a big shift in the field to move away from looking at \u201cwhat\u2019s abnormal\u201d in favour of asking \u201cwhat\u2019s actually harmful\u201d.", "Do check what the legal situation is in your state for grandparents' rights.", ">I do worry about my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom\n\nGiven the situation, I would allow MIL to see your child as long as she behaves, but don't ever allow her to babysit.  And make her leave immediately (or you leave her house immediately) if she says anything critical about you or your fiance's disabilities, anything that implies you're not good parents, or anything negative about your child.  The comments rules definitely apply to your family as well.  You and your fiance need to establish strong, healthy boundaries up front.\n\nYou don't want MIL to have too strong of a relationship track record with your child in case she tries to \"save\" your child by taking them.  It doesn't sound like you'd have any problem proving your legal competency as parents, but there's no reason to make it easy for her to claim an ongoing caregiver relationship with the baby either.  Nor do you want her to have the opportunity to refuse to return your child to you.\n\nDouble check grandparents' rights in your state so if you need to go low contact with either family you know if that makes you vulnerable to a legal visitation order.  In most US states it won't, but in New York it might be an issue.  And some states have funny rules when the mother is not married at the time of the child's birth.  So it's better to be prepared, just in case. If you have any doubt, get a consultation with a family attorney now so you can find out what to do or not do so that you'll be in a strong legal position if any of the grandparents try the unthinkable.", "I'm so sorry that your family see you this way.  You have achieved more than many NT people that I know who have children!  You are a home owner, you have a PHD, you have a good relationship, a stable job... what more could you need before deciding to bring a child into the world.", "I understand  what you are saying. I thought  the question  was related to establishing  a family in that setting. In that case, from personal experience I don't agree with it, but I'm  sure you will be able to find someone  in this section that will agree with  you. Good luck to you and your family.", "Of course they do! It just adds complexities when you consider if baby's needs interfere with their needs (or roommates needs) or vice versa. Babies are LOUD and can overwhelm anyone, including an autistic person. Some people who are autistic stim quite loudly, this would obviously be bad for baby if they need to nap.\n\nI think you also want to consider boundaries with whoever is living with you. Who can help baby, discipline child, put baby down for nap. Who can feed child? That's typical roommate discussion.\n\nYou should also look at how everyone in your home deals with things like stress and anger, and conflict resolution just like neurotypical households. If someone is prone to loud melt downs, that could be distressing to a child.", "That\u2019s not applicable here.", "Thank you for this thoughtful and helpful response.", "And children test boundaries. They disrespect personal space, are loud and messy. It's what they do. If someone in that household would respond poorly to that, it would likely not be the best place for them anymore.\n\nIt boils down to knowing your roommates, and if they are being cycled in and out regularly, you just wouldn't know them well enough, which is something to consider."]}
