{"id": 2206, "submission_id": "yu1dyl", "title": "AITA for wanting to raise my kid in an interdependent household for autistic adults?", "selftext": "When I (29m) bought my house, I imagined it being a space for autistic adults to live interdependently. For the most part, we\u2019ve achieved and become that. Five of us live in the house. I own it but I rent out the rooms at cheap prices ($300 to $500 a month depending on income). We live in a city where a studio goes easily for $1.7k a month.  \n\nOne person was in a shelter for some time. Another was in a nursing home (even though he is 30) and the others have just struggled with finances. \n\nWe\u2019ve become a fun space where we support each other. Teach other skills. Arrange the bus for disabled people by the city. Have events. Do gardening. We have social workers who come by. Nurses and care workers. Help housemates keep and manage jobs. \n\nIt\u2019s become a wildlife sanctuary. And it\u2019s nice to see my housemates flourish since living costs are low they can all catch up on medical costs people might not usually think are associated with autism. It helps me afford people to help clean while I work full time (dream job). \n\nI don\u2019t drive and having housemates allows me to afford a house in the city where my commute into work is 30 mins including my morning coffee.  \n\nI fell in love along the way. With another person who is autistic\u2014Roslyn. Roslyn (31 f) is amazing and beautiful and kind. She gets along with everyone in the house  and we\u2019re best friends. We just found she\u2019s pregnant. It\u2019s sooner than we wanted but we are keeping it. I talk to the fetus and regularly tell them how much we love them. \n\nI told my house mates and three took it really well but one did not. Insistent she doesn\u2019t want to be around a crying baby. There\u2019s no room in the house. She feels betrayed cause she just moved in a couple months ago and wanted to stay here for a couple of years. \n\nThree plan to stay. Which works. Two of them share a bedroom (dating). One is my best friend of 10+ years. \n\nThis clears up one room. My bedroom is big and the walk in closet will be converted to a nursery. The extra bedroom will be used as office space for my fianc\u00e9 and I, and then become our kids bedroom. My best friend offered to help raise the kid. \n\nMy family (parents and sister) are judging me. Saying this is dangerous for a child to have that many \u201cstrangers\u201d in a home. They want me to downsize. Buy a small condo or rent. \n\nBut I love my house. I like seeing Roslyn and housemates on the back porch having coffee. I like how full it is. \n\nMy therapist says I get to teach people how people treat Roslyn and I. How they respond. But I\u2019ve been struggling with that. I came to my parents with excitement and they judged us both as unfit parents.

Like most things - the devil is in the details. There is nothing inherently wrong about what you are planning. It has the potential to work really well. A child can never be surrounded by too much love. However a child changes a lot. Just keep an eye on things to make sure it is a good environment for the child.", "NTA. Children are raised in mixed family/persons housing all the time, very often for much less happy reasons than a safe space for people with disabilities. Unfortunately living situations are a difficult task nowadays, you have done an awesome thing by providing safe and welcoming housing for autistic adults who may otherwise find themselves dependent or homeless; and most importantly, especially for a child, it seems to be filled to the brim with love with two parents who will protect and care for them. It takes a village and I think you have a great little village.", "NTA. It seems like you are functioning just fine and with the right help, you will probably be able to be a fine parent. If not, people around you can either help you to become a better parent, or they can help your child.", "NTA. Lots of people raise children with roommates. People allow relatives to live with them. Having autism doesn't make them any more dangerous to your child than anyone else.", "NTA. You\u2019re helping people, everything is fine.", "NTA\n\nLet's split the circumstances and take them one at a time. \n\nSharing a home is a thing, it's called cohousing. It's perfectly normal and has strong advantages. Nothing wrong with having children in this environment either, quite the contrary as long as everyone is on board. The one housemate is unfortunate, they either will need to get on board with the situation or move out. If they choose the latter, you might want to offer to pay transition expenses. \n\nBeing autistic is also normal, and doesn't make you unfit parents. In fact, I think your folks might be a little bigoted... if you ask them if they think you being autistic makes you unfit,  they'll deny it (but I think this is probably the case and they are blaming their attitude on the housing situation).", "NTA. This is actually beautiful \ud83d\udda4\u2728", "NTA\n\nI think your situation sounds cool and I am taking your word that these are safe people who you trust to be around your child.\n\nYour parents don't like it because it's an unconventional arrangement and they are older and prefer conventional things, probably. They may not be the only ones to judge you. It sucks if they don't want to support, but hopefully they will come around. Regardless, you get to raise the little fetus how you want.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "Your parents are horribly judgemental and it's really none of their business where you raise your kid as long as you aren't neglecting.\n\nYour house sounds lovely!My kids lived with a flatmate for many years till they moved out 2 years ago (the flatmate, not the kids). Another adult in the house can actually be very handy.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your house, your kid, and your plan. Bounce the roommate who doesn't want to live with a crying baby and enjoy the support of the rest of your adopted village.", "NTA. \nCaution, babies are a lot of work so please don't assume anyone is going to help whenever. Have clear boundaries amongst all the housemates and adhere to it. \n\nThe person whose upset, I get it sucks for her. But she can't expect others to put a pause on life for their convenience. \n\nI highly suggest a humidifier. When baby gets congestion, a humidifier was the only thing that helped my little one sleep.", "Is there a way to say you\u2019re not the arsehole, neither would any of your roommates be if they weren\u2019t keen on it but your family are?\n\n\n\n\n\nNTA overall but I would be annoyed if I moved in to a house share and then kids were brought in to the occasion. Yes the room mate can move out but I don\u2019t think them not liking it makes them a bad person. \n\n\n\nYour family are ridiculous though.", "when my son was born, first we lived in a basement at his parents and then when he was 6 months to 13 months, we lived in Florida - first with my sister and then alone. but we moved back to VA. From 13 months to pretty recently we had roommates. we just started renting our own house. and let me tell you. i liked having other people - one house had 6 other kids and 2 other adults\u2026 was it insane? yes. the other house just had 3-4 other adults and 2 dogs and 2 cats.  i do think there were pros and cons of each. and now him being with just us, and our cat\u2026 it is so \u2026quiet. we\u2019ve moved a lot (for a couple reasons that don\u2019t really matter. it was just necessary). i absolutely believe - the more the merrier. it takes a village to raise a child. and i absolutely LOVE seeing non blood (because they do become) family members love my son. and play with him. and know him since he was a baby. watching him grow up. we even joke that we share custody with our friends. i like it that way. sounds like you will too! do what\u2019s best for you and your family! ETA: the thing about having other people around your kid - you do need to be able to trust them 100%. but i would think you wouldn\u2019t be living with people you don\u2019t trust.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kids are sensorily messy af, and won't know for a while how to respect others' sensory needs, etc etc\n\nBut if you've managed this lovely place for a while it seems like you are already well on top of how to facilitate the house. \n\nYou certainly don't need to move out into a nuclear family setup just because your parents don't get it.

This child is going to grow up surrounded by unique people who will give them an abundance of love and an understanding of human nature that many don't get.   They are people you know and cherish, not strangers.", "NTA. These aren\u2019t strangers they\u2019re your roommates and friends.", "I suspect the same. My parents didn\u2019t mind me living with other autistic adults and the independence it\u2019s given me. But I have often suspected they didn\u2019t want me to date another disabled person. At first their reaction was like \u201caw she is autistic too\u201d which both of us felt infantilized by that.

An estimated 90% of children who are sexually abused know their abuser. Not to say that will happen, but there should be awareness of the possibility and warning signs.", "At least you see it early for what it is. Your next step is to do all the necessary paperwork to make sure you are declared fit as parents. Both of you need to see psychiatrists, take parenting classes, baby CPR the whole gambit. Not because it is necessary but to preempt any antics from your ableist family. \n\nThey may try to do something heinous like call CPS or even take custody of the child. \n\nGet background checks on the housemates and keep all that stuff in a binder. Your parents are not to be trusted at this point."]}
