He had me help him skin everything in the front yard. Much to the horror of our neighbors cuz we lived in a trailer park. Deer we left hanging so they had time to cure. We\u2019d then process the animals & sell the hides. There wasn\u2019t anything we didn\u2019t eat growing up. We shared the meat with family.

Then we ate the geese for Xmas dinner that year.\n\nMy childhood was very unconventional, but those experiences are ones I learned from as a kid. My husband hunts & we\u2018ve always had the meat processed. Even if it was something we wouldn\u2019t eat (liver, kidneys, etc) I fed it to the dogs. The reality is our food comes from something living, but being taught how to respect that life & not waste it for sport is the difference. Canning, jarring, preserving food is what will help us with the coming climate changes that will worsen.

Speaking as a YW president (the adult in charge of YW), if the boys wanted to be there too, they should have 1) asked, 2) made it a combined activity.  Also,  that bishop is way out of line,  and needs some training with his stake president.  Also,  with the current Children and Youth Program,  all activities should be centered around the teenager's personal goals and spearheaded by the teens. Within reason, anything they want to do,  go for it.  Personally, the only activities I have told my YW that they could not do have been skiing (for budget reasons), tarot (for religious reasons) and fireworks (for safety reasons). Activities I have said yes to include car maintenance,  woodworking, rock climbing, boxing and rifle shooting.  Along with sewing, baking and other general life skills.  Also,  we were planning to make bread and the boys wanted to do it to.  So,  our boys made bread with us.  I don't believe in boy-only  vs girl-only activities.

I wholeheartedly agreed and to teach them this last Thursday. On Wednesday there was an incident with a bull moose on my property and I ended up with a moose I needed to butcher. (I promise this wasn't planned, he was in my yard and attacking my elderly dog) I thought this would be great to teach so I decided to show the girls how to butcher game meat before their canning/jarring lesson. I called the leader in charge and asked if this would be too much for the girls but she was very excited and said this is something the girls would love as they have been complaining that their activities were redundant and boring. So we rescheduled for Saturday so we would have more time. When I pulled up to the chapel on Saturday the young men group was there and saw the moose meat I had and asked what was going on. I told them then started setting up with my niece.\n\nAbout 30 minutes before it was supposed to start their young men leader said the YM would be doing the butchering lesson with me instead of the YW and the YW would clean up and cook after. Apparently the young men and some of their chaperones started complaining that they would rather learn from me than go shoveling driveways. I told their leader I was here to teach the girls and if they wanted to join they could, but he said he already spoke to the YW leader and bishop and got the ok to basically take over their lesson. By this time girls and their leaders already started showing up and were very excited so I told him no that I was in charge of this activity and if he didn't like what I had offered than they could leave.\n\nThe YW leader said we needed to wait to start because she got a call from her bishop saying to wait until he got there. Once he did he told me he expected my lesson to be more about jarring, preserves, gardening, and other \"womanly\" things. Having grown up in their church I realized what was happening and packed my stuff up. I told the YW that if any of them still wanted to learn that they could come follow me back to my place.\n\nBefore I left I got bombarded with calls from my parents and brother saying that I should just go along with it and that I'm going to make my niece's social life at church hard. I asked my niece and she said she's fine with what I did. AITA for wanting to teach these girls?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I grew up in redneck country and most of the girls in our friends group could clean, cut and store a deer faster than I ever could let me tell you hwat.\n\nI honestly think that canning/preserving should be one aspect of a broader whole of food prep that should be taught, regardless of sex. Everyone eats, everyone can learn to cook. I'd probably do more canning/preserving if I ate more than the like 3 veggies than I do. And even I have to admit that I'll only eat so many pickles if my lifetime.\n\nYour church is the problem, OP. Not you.\n\nBtw, y'all got any of that moose meat left?", "NTA... we need more people willing to teach these skills to the younger generation. I put up about 30 quarts of game meat every year, depending on how my hunting goes. I teach anyone willing to listen.", "INFO why do you insist upon calling the young women girls, but you don\u2019t call the young men boys? It\u2019s nothing really to do with the story but it really stands out. You seem to want to empower these young ladies by teaching them a skill, while at the same time infantilizing them by using girls rather than young women. It\u2019s odd.", "LDS, sounds like. So yeah.", "I'm guessing you're Mormom! Thank you for this!! So many Mormom women need some validation that they're important, and that there are other ways of thinking out there! Thank you, internet stranger!", "Most of the ones who drove themselves did! Unfortunately of the 7 that followed 4 or them got in trouble for coming with me and had to leave early.", "Yeah, the reproductive plumbing doesn't affect the gastrointestinal plumbing! Everybody needs to eat! Everybody needs food prep/cooking life skills!", "That was offered. The men's group declined, probably because they wanted to be sure the women could clean up after them.\n\nOP just refused to yeah to only one group.", "I'm so glad to hear this, it gives me hope that the church is changing. I moved around a bunch and split YM/YW activities has always been my experience. I do live in a more conservative state now so maybe that's why they're more into gendered activities", "\u201cBut the woman childrn, don\u2019t knees to know how to clear game, that man work!

PASHA!!\u201d\n\n-Church leadership", "No they are teenagers and children. Calling them young women helps the church culture of marrying them off at 18.", "You really shouldn\u2019t vote if you\u2019re not going to bother to read it", "Yeah, the only time I hear bishop: Roman Catholic church, Anglican/episcopal, or LDS, and the prepper emphasis def reads LDS to me", "Thank you but no \u2014 not Mormon. And actually not a fan of religious life. \n\nI\u2019m a lawyer, and I believe strongly that faith is a private matter, and should never affect what American children\u2019s learn. Discrimination from a church in matters of learning & knowledge is a Dark Ages concept, and has no place in a \u201cliberal progressive country,\u201d to quote George Washington. This country is a product of the Enlightenment Era, and it separated church from state because compulsory belief systems limit knowledge & progress.  If a church sponsors lessons, they should do so in an equitable, American way. It is not American to treat women as lesser beings, any more. We will regain our reproductive rights. We must always resist oppression, wherever it arises. We will not go backwards. That\u2019s my take on \u201dManifest Destiny.\u201d\n\nRegardless, I am a fan of any woman who stands up for girls\u2019 rights to learn, be and do. Religious life can limit girls\u2019 opportunities, as this example clearly shows. But at least these specific girls will have learned that we don\u2019t need to put up with men telling us how things are going to go. \n\nWait \u2014 I just remembered. On my mother\u2019s side, her biodad\u2019s family are original Mormon settlors in Utah. And before Utah. They\u2019re written down in some books or something. We only found out late in my mom\u2019s life b/c she was hidden from him.

The other week, the girls were doing a service project, but we finished what we were making early. The boys were playing pinguard in the gym. So,  the girls went and played with them,  and our bishop (who was playing pinguard too) didn't even blink.", "I would recommend if you get further push back say you didn\u2019t feel comfortable teaching men as a woman.", "Actually,  you'll find that there's no such direction, just this specific bishop is a jerk. In fact,  there was recently direction stating that under no circumstances could the girls have a smaller yearly budget than the boys (per participant, if your congregation has 15 boys and 3 girls,  obviously the boys get more money for their activities overall)", "18?!  \nThat\u2019s some Y\u2019all-Queda bullshit right there!", "No it doesn't.  Partly because the average age of marriage in the LDS faith is 23.", "Which means that there\u2019s a whole BUNCH of people that are *less* than 23 just to pull the age *that* low.", "I am LDS and 31.  I got married at 27.  I know three people my age that got married at 18.  I would say the 23 average is pretty indicative of the median and approximate mode of my peers.  Yes, I know people that got married at 19 and 20 and 21.  I also know people who are still not married, or got married at 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.  The vast majority of LDS people are married by 30, yes.  But getting married at younger than 21 is very unusual.  And also is usually comment for, \"Dang, they're young!  Wow!\"  If I'm home for Christmas and my parents get a marriage announcement for the child of a friend, and they're less than 21 or 22, there's certainly a moment of, \"She just graduated from high school!  Wow.\"  So, in conclusion, yes, we marry younger than the average US population.  But we're not child-briding over here.  (For context, the average age of marriage for the US at large is 28)."]}
