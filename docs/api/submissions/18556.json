My sister and her husband - Caitrin and Ian - worked out a plan to babysit my kids for part of the week for a few weeks so I could work extra hours and get back on my feet. They would keep the kids Monday - Friday and I would have them on the weekends. The kids enjoyed it and they got to play with my sister's kids - ages 9 and 7 - so we kept the arrangement going.\n\nThis weekend everything hit the fan. My ONLY rule was that my sister and her husband were not to take my kids to their church because I don't know what goes on there. Well, on Friday my kids asked if they could stay the weekend with my sister and she and her husband were okay with it because they were going to a \"Family Field Day\". I said it was fine. When I got them back on Saturday I was helping my kids unpack and my 11 year old had a card he supposedly made at the field day event. He was supposed to draw his family and he drew Caitrin and Ian with himself and his siblings followed by Caitrin and Ian's kids. I wasn't on the picture.\n\nI asked him about it and that's when I found out the field day was actually a church event. I called my sister. Her excuses were that it was sponsored by the church but was not at the church or even considered a church event which I don't believe. I also asked her about the picture and she said she saw it but didn't talk to my kid about it. I told her how hurt I was because she and Ian are okay with me being replaced in my son's mind.\n\nI hung up and a while later sent her the following message: \"Your services will no longer be needed. I'm enrolling the kids in daycare. Thanks for everything.\"\n\nShe asked if we could talk again and I said maybe later. I told our other sister (who lives abroad and therefore is no help) and she said I am being an AH and said I need to talk to Caitrin but I disagree.

No offense but what did you expect when your children are with them five days a week ? \n\nThey took your kids in to help. They had no obligation to help.  Your sister and her husband didn't do anything. They cared for and loved your kids.\n\nFor the record she didn't turn your kids against you. Not at all\nEditing. They didn't take them to church services. But an event sponsored by the church. There's quite a big difference there.", "Two questions:\n\nHow is your sister turning your children against you?\n\nHow is your sister less of a parent to these kids than you are if she takes care of them 5/7 days of the week?", "Yta - I would take no church as services or sermon. So you should define your rules clearly.\n\n2nd.. so you abandon your kids 5 out of 7 days a week and your \u201churt\u201d that your kids are forming stronger relationships/family bonds with their caretakers? They are more parents to the children than you atm bc being a parent requires you to be there and you\u2019re not there. \n\n3rd I\u2019m confused did you not want the children to think of your family as their family? Are you confused and thought your family had any control over what your kids are drawing? Did you want your family to dictate what your kids draw?\n\nAlso\u2026 doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re paying your family for raising your kids for you\u2026 so in what world are your considered not an AH? Free help and You\u2019re mad? Talk about ungrateful.", "YTA, It seems like your more upset that your son drew a picture with the people he spends the majority of the time with rather than it being a church event, and your reaction is to take him away from people that he clearly cares a lot about.", "Jeez you really do expect a lot for nothing but aggravation in return. Four children, Five days a week and you\u2019re complaining AND you have snubbed your VERY successful, VERY reliable support system. \n\nI don\u2019t attend church either, but I sure wouldn\u2019t be taking this stance with the people who have had your back when you needed it. \n\nEnjoy paying for child care and running yourself ragged because you refuse to give your sister the benefit of the doubt. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. How exactly are you planning to pay for 5 days a week of day care? Your sister did you a massive favor. She didn't take the kids TO church but rather to a church event. If you're really going to tell someone who is watching your kids for free that they can't do anything church related FIVE DAYS A WEEK, then yeah, you're the TA here.\n\nYou say you \"don't know what goes on there\" but how do you know what goes on at a daycare? Do your kids enjoy the time with your sister and her family? Because it seems to me like you're upset about the drawing and parlaying that into somehow your sister turning your kids against you, which is ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nShe didn't talk to your son about the picture because that is solidly a conversation your son should be having with his *parent*.  Which, as you make sure to note, is not your sister.  But you can't have it both ways: you want her to do the heavy lifting of parenting while still getting all the credit in your kids' minds.  The problem here is not your sister.  It's that your kids are too smart for this.  They have seen your sister do the lion's share of their parenting, and now they're expressing that in their art.  And you, the parent, need to talk to them about this.\n\nRather than step in and alienate you by taking your parenting duties from you, your sister gave you the space to have this conversation with your kid.  But when given the opportunity to step up and be a parent, you complained about that too.  Your sister can't win for trying.\n\nThe Family Field Day was a miscommunication.  Your sister could have been more forthcoming with the details, but you also should be ASKING for those details before sending your kids.  It doesn't sound like the did anything maliciously, and as the parent, I do think the onus is on YOU to ask for details before deciding to send your kids to events.", "YTA.\n\nThis has nothing to do with any church at all.\n\nYou decided to leave your kid 5 days \u00e0 week for about 6 months now.

You\u2019re losing your mind (and possibly ruining a wonderful, stable childcare situation) over something trivial/invented in your own mind. \n\nI am an atheist. My kids have participated in all kinds of church-sponsored community events because they\u2019re really fun. \n\nThe picture your kid drew sounds like it represents the family that was with him that day. It IS a picture of his family, but you jumping to the conclusion that you not being in it means he somehow doesn\u2019t think of you family is not reasonable and shows some major insecurities in your part.", "YTA. You're blaming your sister for a situation caused by the fact that the kids are there 5 days a week. The church thing (which wasn't even a church thing) is not relevant to this at all, outside of the fact that your kid happened to draw a picture there. Maybe talk to your kids about why they don't feel close to you and seek family counseling. Depriving your kids of seeing their cousins and your siblings isn't going to help, it's going to make them resent you.\n\n\nEdit: also, firing her?? She's been parenting your children for FREE. she's been doing you a favor. She's been making your kids feel wanted.", "YTA. They didn't take the kids to church, and your children clearly like being over there with them. You sound like you're just punishing your children for preferring people who are actually there for them.", "YTA were the kids staying over at their house 5 days per week? Surely there\u2019s no need for that. You can\u2019t blame them as they see your sister more than you.", "This reads as the non custodial parent (you), getting upset that the custodial parent (your sister & her hubby) gets drawn in a family picture and not you.\n\nEven when \"on your feet\" you decided to keep the arrangement going. This is not your sister purposely trying to alienate you from your kids, this is your children acclimating to the family unit they are now a part of the majority of the week.\n\nSorry but YTA, you were clearly okay with this setup of not seeing your own children 5 days out of 7 otherwise you would have taken them back as soon as you could. Blame \"church\" all you want, but the whole thing falls on you.\n\nBy completely cutting the children off from their aunt, you will be harming them emotionally.  \nTheir father it seems has already cut them off as there is no mention where he fits into this, you partially cut them off, now the family that they have been a part of you want to take away.\n\nYou need to think about this long and hard. In the meantime go to court and get some child support to help offset you working 7 days a week & spend some quality time with your kids.", "YTA for not taking the kids into consideration or talking with your sister first", "YTA, and just threw away the best babysitting option you had because of your own insecurities.\n\nThe picture isn\u2019t your sister\u2019s fault. I hesitate to say it\u2019s your \u201cfault\u201d, because it sounds like you\u2019re doing the best you can in terms of childcare, but you need to grow up and recognize that there was nothing malicious in your kid\u2019s picture. **No one has \u201cturned him against you\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s you projecting because you feel sad or guilty about not being able to spend as much time with your kids as you think you should.**\n\nAs for the church thing, it doesn\u2019t sound like the event was religious in nature. But you refused to believe your sister, either because you have trust issues with her in general or because you were already feeling spiteful about her time with the kids and wanted to add another reason to be mad at her.

If it\u2019s he first one, why would you have let her look after your kids in the first place?", "YTA. \n\nYour sister and her husband have been raising the kids for months and you have had weekend visitation. You chose to continue this because the kids were thriving and happy. Now you pulled that away from them because you are upset about a picture? And how is your sister \"turning your kids against you?\" Nothing she has done has turned them against you. \n\nBTW, did you pat child support or childcare costs for those months? Did you provide food for your kids every day? Did you pay for any activities they did?", "YTA. Your sister is in no way turning your kids against you. You are doing it yourself, by abandonning your kids 5 days a week.

I get the hurt, but church had nothing to do with it, and honestly, neither did your sister. It's how the kid's seeing his world, and it hurts you to know that's how he sees his world, but that's honestly no one's fault. That's just being a single mom that has to work. I grew up with one.

Big time. \n\nThat field day doesn\u2019t even sound like a church event. Sponsored or not.

Your son\u2019s been spending the majority of his time, by a wide margin, with his aunt and cousins. He drew a picture reflecting that. Instead of talking with him about it, or maybe promising to spend some more time together, you react emotionally and elect to remove the closest ties he has to other family members.

Yeah, YTA. \n\nI\u2019m not getting on you for \u201cabandoning\u201d your kids, because based on your info, you\u2019re not.

There are many innocent reasons why he may have drawn the picture he did that do not involve any commentary on your parenting.  He might have just drawn \"the people I was here with today\", who happen to be a subset of his family, so it made sense to him to represent his family like that in this context.  Or, he might really be struggling with the situation.\n\nBut it's on YOU as the parent to have that conversation with your child.  Your sister was right not to open up that can of worms and leave that to you.  Depending on what the reasoning is for his picture, that conversation might need to be with a parent.  And rather than ruin everyone's day by making it an issue, your sister saved that parenting conversation and that parenting work for you.  \n\nNon-parents should leave potentially big conversations to the parents to handle.  That's the right call.  Your sister did that.  Yes, she left you with all the work in this situation, but that work is *parenting* and she was right to leave it to you.

But your kids now see your sister and her family as their \u201csecond family\u201d - which is a really good thing, given your circumstances. It\u2019s not surprising if they spend five days a week there. It does not mean your sister is alienating them from you in any way, just that she is loving and caring for them.

Is there something her church has done to you or said that makes you feel this way? \n\nIf not, YTA not only because it was just a field day event, but because you\u2019re insulting your sisters church by behaving so strongly about something that was not a religious service.

It's not like the mom is absent or unloving. This is the church's doing.", "That's such horseshit. Church's are INCAPABLE of not shoving their beliefs in everyone's face.

As for your first point, one of the tenants of Christianity is to do good work without t an earthly reward. I would say hosting a free event for the community is good work.

Then, this particular weekend, they didn't see you at all. It seems you're just really upset about the picture, and the \"broken rule\" just added to the flame. \n\nYou should take your sister's word for what it is and forgive them because it's nothing to be upset about in the first place (talking about the broken rule). It was a sponsored event by the church, and they weren't inside the church. I'm not religious, not one bit, and as long as it wasn't in the church, it doesn't matter. If it comes to your attention again that they took your kids inside the church, then you confront them. \n\nThe picture, however, it's okay to feel heartbroken, but you need to think about the reality your kids are in. They're spending their time with their aunt, uncle, and cousins throughout the week, and they barely see you. You have good intentions with why they don't see you, but you have to think about how they feel about this whole ordeal with you not being around.", "YTA. Mom got upset about a picture her son drew.  He could have drawn it anywhere at any time.  Mom is jealous of the son\u2019s relationship with her sister\u2019s family, a relationship she encouraged and profited from until she felt slighted.  But the sister did not do the slighting.  Her own son drew his five day a week family.  She was not in the picture he drew, but she is not in the picture when the kids are at her sister\u2019s.  She used the marginally church related excuse to attack her sister who has done nothing but help her, care for her kids and save her money on daycare.  If not knowing what goes on at the church is a problem OP can attend the church a couple of times and check it out, something I would presume she would do for any activity her kids were involved in.  She might not agree with everything about the church, but she does not  agree totally with her sister and still sends the kids there, and few parents totally agree with what and how schools teach but they send their kids even if they find it flawed.  This just seems like a knee-jerk jealousy response.", "YTA. You relinquished too much of the care of your children to your sister and her husband.  Temporarily, it was generous and helpful of them to take care of the kids while you got back on your feet but it shouldn't have become a permanent arrangement. \n\nIf your children are spending the majority of their time with their aunt and uncle and only see their mom on weekends and their dad not at all(?), it should be expected that the kids will see their aunt and uncle as their primary parental figures.\n\nYour rage at your sister is unjustified. The children were not brought to a church service, were they?  That's what you told your sister not to do.  Many people attend religiously sponsored events although they do not attend the church itself.  Get a grip. \n\nAlso, before judging the church, why didn't you ever attend a service so you can know what goes on there? Since your sister is a congregant it might be wise to see what the church is preaching because whether or not your children are attending the services, your sister is, and she is sharing those beliefs with your children.\n\nMaybe you should have asked more questions about the event before agreeing that your children could go if you were so concerned about who was sponsoring it.  But let's be honest, you are upset because your son drew a picture of his family without you, his mother, in it.  \n\nInstead of blowing up at your sister, talk to your son about how he is feeling.  I am sure he isn't so keen on having a part-time mother and no father anymore.  It has been a hell of a lot of changes for your kids as well.  And call your sister and apologize, she is not at fault here and has only been supportive of you and your kids.

I was indoctrinated in Catholicism my whole life, and after leaving the church I was very insistent that my child does not have any religion shoved down her throat. We educate her about religion, but she can choose her own when she\u2019s old enough to develop her own connection to one. However, your sister is absolutely correct. \n\n\nChurches host events all the time (Breakfast with Santa, Easter egg hunts, etc). Even though there may be some religious people at the events that leads to exposure to some religion, it is by no means akin to attending church. I have no doubt as an adult that you\u2019re aware of this, and I think you\u2019re grasping at straws for ways to blame your sister for the drawing your son made. \n\nIt is not your sister\u2019s fault that your son is viewing his family as his family. His aunt and uncle *are* his family, and it\u2019s worth mentioning **they** were the ones at the event! The drawing was \u201cdraw your family,\u201d and those were the family members that were there with your son. It was just a mindless drawing that your son did there and then, and I doubt it was meant to be intentionally hurtful. He just drew what he had going on at the time. \n\n\nI feel you\u2019re hurt about the drawing and trying to blame your sister for bringing him to the place the drawing was done by griping about religion, despite the fact that you\u2019re grown enough to know that wasn\u2019t really the case. Also, why didn\u2019t you go to the event? Why can\u2019t you pick your sons up every night? It\u2019s insane to me they spend so much time with your sister\u2019s family and you chose to give up more time instead of spending time with them at this event. If you had gone, you\u2019d probably be in the picture. \n\nYou\u2019re absent to your sons and you\u2019re ungrateful to your sister. Being a single mom is difficult (I know), but try to prioritize using the time you actually have and being grateful you actually have support like that, because the vast majority of us single parents do not have it. \n\nYour sons are going to resent you for pulling them from their family and sticking them with strangers and your son is going to blame himself because of the fuss you made from his picture.

Way more than that if you want someone half decent. I hope you\u2019re on time every single day to pick them up too because some of those places charge crazy late-pickup fees and will eventually kick you out if you\u2019re late too often. but this is all totally worth it to own your sister who\u2026took your kids to a field day hosted by a church. \n\nYTA but at least your sister doesnt have to watch six kids at a time anymore I guess? seems like more of a win for her than you, but we all have our hills to die on", "It was an event sponsored by the church, not church.

A random pagan club might be outside the norms of society, but they\u2019re not a cult unless they\u2019re excessively controlling.\n\nMost people in cults are nowhere near comfortable with going straight from being entrenched in a cult to straight-up atheism. Most people in cults also find it *incredibly difficult* to recognize and confront the problems in their cults, never mind escaping them. You hear \u201call religions are cults\u201d when you\u2019re actually in a cult, your mind isn\u2019t going anywhere helpful:\n\n- \u201cAll religions are cults? Yeah, that\u2019s insane. People will call anything a cult. Those nasty people who left my church and keep calling it a cult think anything\u2019s a cult\u2014they\u2019re idiots and I would be stupid to leave like them.\u201d\n- \u201cAll religions are cults, so even though I think my church might be abusing me, other churches will be just as abusive. Escaping would mean leaving religion entirely and burning in hell.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s just a slap in the face to the victims and survivors of cults. Stop saying this stupid shit.", "Social acceptance.", "Tough shit, Im following you now. Youre gonna be a cult leader whether you like it or not", "Why would I listen to a cult like you?", "Yea.. you are aware that cult leaders actually twist religious scriptures into scaring or brainwashing people right? \n\nIt's actually cult leaders who think God \"talks\" to them when really, they need to get on meds for their mental illness if they think they're God or they say the second coming is gonna happen on this or that day.", "my kid's (not affiliated with any religion) college graduation opened with a prayer, does that make it a church event?", "We don't know how that conversation went, the 11yo could have simply said this was at a church - which would be true - but that still doesn't make it a church event.\n\nAlso, i highly doubt this field day opened with a prayer, lol.", "I understand you and OP seem to be on the same page of avoiding any and all events/gatherings with 51% people present being religious but generally when people say \u201cI do/don\u2019t go to church\u201d \u201cplease do/don\u2019t take my kids to church\u201d they mean going to the ceremony/sermon on the designated holy day of that belief. She knew her sister\u2019s family was religious and relinquished a majority of the parenting time/duties over to her. Sister still minded the boundary and has gone to one community event. You can say it was funded, planned, attended by, church goers but it was just as religious as a car wash fundraiser. At the end of the day OP can do what she wants. Setting a boundary is fine and discussing the intricacies of said boundary should\u2019ve happened before the 22 week mark. Either way ending a child\u2019s relationship with their primary caretaker abruptly is an AH move (since no one was hurt/in danger)", "I'm well aware of them. The difference is, we don't all high five each other at the movie theater and start discussing the sacraments. You sound foolish. I'll bet you work with at least 2 people who belong to the same church, you going to actually stand up for your beliefs and quit now?", "I mean sure, but church is an incredibly minimal part of the actual issue here. They could have gone to a non church event and been asked to draw a family picture and OP would be just as upset, just without church to blame a problem she created on.", "So your experience is everyone's and not a single other church can have a different one, I see.\n\nStill ignoring my other point but I see you don't actually have an argument for it, just a whole bunch of anti-church spiel.\n\nI'm not actually arguing for the church, or saying that OP doesn't have the right to remove her children and put them in a day care. Just that she's the AH for blaming the people looking after her children for the distance between her and her children and not addressing the actual problem she has, instead blaming them and the church for it.", ">The church sponsored event I went to were very much church based in their language.\n\nYes, because this means every church sponsored event everywhere is the same, right?\n\nEdit - And damn, I should have finished reading your comment below I replied. Had I done so, I would have realized how utterly pointless arguing with you is.\n\nIf someone doesn't use logic to get themself into that position, you can't use logic to get them out of it.", "To be fair, judging is the purpose of this sub", "Who does?

That sounds pretty delusional to me.\n\nMany religions have induction ceremonies and rituals that they perform on infants and small children, before they can form their own thoughts and reasoning. That sounds pretty scary and brainwashy to me.\n\nJust because some religions are more out there than others, doesn't really change how delusional they are. \n\n\"a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister.\n\na misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing.\"\n\nWhat is \"relatively small\", \"strange and sinister\" and \"misplaced or excessive\" can be subjective based on who is judging. This is like the dude earlier today who was upset that his girlfriend said styrofoam instead of polystyrene because he said the use of styrofoam is technically incorrect. Same thing, one is just a brand name for the other in my opinion."]}
