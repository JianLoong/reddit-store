My sister and her husband - Caitrin and Ian - worked out a plan to babysit my kids for part of the week for a few weeks so I could work extra hours and get back on my feet. They would keep the kids Monday - Friday and I would have them on the weekends. The kids enjoyed it and they got to play with my sister's kids - ages 9 and 7 - so we kept the arrangement going.\n\nThis weekend everything hit the fan. My ONLY rule was that my sister and her husband were not to take my kids to their church because I don't know what goes on there. Well, on Friday my kids asked if they could stay the weekend with my sister and she and her husband were okay with it because they were going to a \"Family Field Day\". I said it was fine. When I got them back on Saturday I was helping my kids unpack and my 11 year old had a card he supposedly made at the field day event. He was supposed to draw his family and he drew Caitrin and Ian with himself and his siblings followed by Caitrin and Ian's kids. I wasn't on the picture.\n\nI asked him about it and that's when I found out the field day was actually a church event. I called my sister. Her excuses were that it was sponsored by the church but was not at the church or even considered a church event which I don't believe. I also asked her about the picture and she said she saw it but didn't talk to my kid about it. I told her how hurt I was because she and Ian are okay with me being replaced in my son's mind.\n\nI hung up and a while later sent her the following message: \"Your services will no longer be needed. I'm enrolling the kids in daycare. Thanks for everything.\"\n\nShe asked if we could talk again and I said maybe later. I told our other sister (who lives abroad and therefore is no help) and she said I am being an AH and said I need to talk to Caitrin but I disagree.

Your sister and her husband didn't do anything. They cared for and loved your kids.\n\nFor the record she didn't turn your kids against you. Not at all\nEditing.

So you should define your rules clearly.\n\n2nd.. so you abandon your kids 5 out of 7 days a week and your \u201churt\u201d that your kids are forming stronger relationships/family bonds with their caretakers? They are more parents to the children than you atm bc being a parent requires you to be there and you\u2019re not there. \n\n3rd I\u2019m confused did you not want the children to think of your family as their family? Are you confused and thought your family had any control over what your kids are drawing? Did you want your family to dictate what your kids draw?\n\nAlso\u2026 doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re paying your family for raising your kids for you\u2026 so in what world are your considered not an AH? Free help and You\u2019re mad? Talk about ungrateful.", "YTA, It seems like your more upset that your son drew a picture with the people he spends the majority of the time with rather than it being a church event, and your reaction is to take him away from people that he clearly cares a lot about.", "Jeez you really do expect a lot for nothing but aggravation in return. Four children, Five days a week and you\u2019re complaining AND you have snubbed your VERY successful, VERY reliable support system. \n\nI don\u2019t attend church either, but I sure wouldn\u2019t be taking this stance with the people who have had your back when you needed it. \n\nEnjoy paying for child care and running yourself ragged because you refuse to give your sister the benefit of the doubt. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. How exactly are you planning to pay for 5 days a week of day care? Your sister did you a massive favor. She didn't take the kids TO church but rather to a church event. If you're really going to tell someone who is watching your kids for free that they can't do anything church related FIVE DAYS A WEEK, then yeah, you're the TA here.\n\nYou say you \"don't know what goes on there\" but how do you know what goes on at a daycare? Do your kids enjoy the time with your sister and her family? Because it seems to me like you're upset about the drawing and parlaying that into somehow your sister turning your kids against you, which is ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nShe didn't talk to your son about the picture because that is solidly a conversation your son should be having with his *parent*.  Which, as you make sure to note, is not your sister.  But you can't have it both ways: you want her to do the heavy lifting of parenting while still getting all the credit in your kids' minds.  The problem here is not your sister.  It's that your kids are too smart for this.  They have seen your sister do the lion's share of their parenting, and now they're expressing that in their art.  And you, the parent, need to talk to them about this.\n\nRather than step in and alienate you by taking your parenting duties from you, your sister gave you the space to have this conversation with your kid.  But when given the opportunity to step up and be a parent, you complained about that too.  Your sister can't win for trying.\n\nThe Family Field Day was a miscommunication.  Your sister could have been more forthcoming with the details, but you also should be ASKING for those details before sending your kids.  It doesn't sound like the did anything maliciously, and as the parent, I do think the onus is on YOU to ask for details before deciding to send your kids to events.", "YTA.\n\nThis has nothing to do with any church at all.\n\nYou decided to leave your kid 5 days \u00e0 week for about 6 months now.

You\u2019re losing your mind (and possibly ruining a wonderful, stable childcare situation) over something trivial/invented in your own mind. \n\nI am an atheist. My kids have participated in all kinds of church-sponsored community events because they\u2019re really fun. \n\nThe picture your kid drew sounds like it represents the family that was with him that day. It IS a picture of his family, but you jumping to the conclusion that you not being in it means he somehow doesn\u2019t think of you family is not reasonable and shows some major insecurities in your part.", "YTA. You're blaming your sister for a situation caused by the fact that the kids are there 5 days a week. The church thing (which wasn't even a church thing) is not relevant to this at all, outside of the fact that your kid happened to draw a picture there. Maybe talk to your kids about why they don't feel close to you and seek family counseling. Depriving your kids of seeing their cousins and your siblings isn't going to help, it's going to make them resent you.\n\n\nEdit: also, firing her?? She's been parenting your children for FREE. she's been doing you a favor. She's been making your kids feel wanted.", "YTA. They didn't take the kids to church, and your children clearly like being over there with them. You sound like you're just punishing your children for preferring people who are actually there for them.", "YTA were the kids staying over at their house 5 days per week? Surely there\u2019s no need for that. You can\u2019t blame them as they see your sister more than you.", "This reads as the non custodial parent (you), getting upset that the custodial parent (your sister & her hubby) gets drawn in a family picture and not you.\n\nEven when \"on your feet\" you decided to keep the arrangement going. This is not your sister purposely trying to alienate you from your kids, this is your children acclimating to the family unit they are now a part of the majority of the week.\n\nSorry but YTA, you were clearly okay with this setup of not seeing your own children 5 days out of 7 otherwise you would have taken them back as soon as you could. Blame \"church\" all you want, but the whole thing falls on you.\n\nBy completely cutting the children off from their aunt, you will be harming them emotionally.  \nTheir father it seems has already cut them off as there is no mention where he fits into this, you partially cut them off, now the family that they have been a part of you want to take away.\n\nYou need to think about this long and hard. In the meantime go to court and get some child support to help offset you working 7 days a week & spend some quality time with your kids.", "YTA for not taking the kids into consideration or talking with your sister first", "YTA, and just threw away the best babysitting option you had because of your own insecurities.\n\nThe picture isn\u2019t your sister\u2019s fault. ~~I hesitate to say it\u2019s your \u201cfault\u201d, because it sounds like you\u2019re doing the best you can in terms of childcare, but~~ you need to grow up and recognize that there was nothing malicious in your kid\u2019s picture. **No one has \u201cturned him against you\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s you projecting because you feel sad or guilty about not being able to spend as much time with your kids as you think you should.**\n\nAs for the church thing, it doesn\u2019t sound like the event was religious in nature.

Did you provide food for your kids every day? Did you pay for any activities they did?", "YTA. Your sister is in no way turning your kids against you. You are doing it yourself, by abandonning your kids 5 days a week.

I get the hurt, but church had nothing to do with it, and honestly, neither did your sister. It's how the kid's seeing his world, and it hurts you to know that's how he sees his world, but that's honestly no one's fault. That's just being a single mom that has to work. I grew up with one.

Big time. \n\nThat field day doesn\u2019t even sound like a church event. Sponsored or not.

Your son\u2019s been spending the majority of his time, by a wide margin, with his aunt and cousins. He drew a picture reflecting that.

There are many innocent reasons why he may have drawn the picture he did that do not involve any commentary on your parenting.  He might have just drawn \"the people I was here with today\", who happen to be a subset of his family, so it made sense to him to represent his family like that in this context.  Or, he might really be struggling with the situation.\n\nBut it's on YOU as the parent to have that conversation with your child.  Your sister was right not to open up that can of worms and leave that to you.  Depending on what the reasoning is for his picture, that conversation might need to be with a parent.  And rather than ruin everyone's day by making it an issue, your sister saved that parenting conversation and that parenting work for you.  \n\nNon-parents should leave potentially big conversations to the parents to handle.  That's the right call.  Your sister did that.  Yes, she left you with all the work in this situation, but that work is *parenting* and she was right to leave it to you.

I get that you're trying to get money for you and your kids. However, you expect your kids to show you undying love when they only see you 2 times a week? Then, this particular weekend, they didn't see you at all. It seems you're just really upset about the picture, and the \"broken rule\" just added to the flame. \n\nYou should take your sister's word for what it is and forgive them because it's nothing to be upset about in the first place (talking about the broken rule). It was a sponsored event by the church, and they weren't inside the church. I'm not religious, not one bit, and as long as it wasn't in the church, it doesn't matter. If it comes to your attention again that they took your kids inside the church, then you confront them. \n\nThe picture, however, it's okay to feel heartbroken, but you need to think about the reality your kids are in. They're spending their time with their aunt, uncle, and cousins throughout the week, and they barely see you. You have good intentions with why they don't see you, but you have to think about how they feel about this whole ordeal with you not being around.", "YTA. Mom got upset about a picture her son drew.  He could have drawn it anywhere at any time.  Mom is jealous of the son\u2019s relationship with her sister\u2019s family, a relationship she encouraged and profited from until she felt slighted.  But the sister did not do the slighting.  Her own son drew his five day a week family.  She was not in the picture he drew, but she is not in the picture when the kids are at her sister\u2019s.  She used the marginally church related excuse to attack her sister who has done nothing but help her, care for her kids and save her money on daycare.  If not knowing what goes on at the church is a problem OP can attend the church a couple of times and check it out, something I would presume she would do for any activity her kids were involved in.  She might not agree with everything about the church, but she does not  agree totally with her sister and still sends the kids there, and few parents totally agree with what and how schools teach but they send their kids even if they find it flawed.  This just seems like a knee-jerk jealousy response.", "YTA. You relinquished too much of the care of your children to your sister and her husband.  Temporarily, it was generous and helpful of them to take care of the kids while you got back on your feet but it shouldn't have become a permanent arrangement. \n\nIf your children are spending the majority of their time with their aunt and uncle and only see their mom on weekends and their dad not at all(?), it should be expected that the kids will see their aunt and uncle as their primary parental figures.\n\nYour rage at your sister is unjustified. The children were not brought to a church service, were they?  That's what you told your sister not to do.  Many people attend religiously sponsored events although they do not attend the church itself.  Get a grip. \n\nAlso, before judging the church, why didn't you ever attend a service so you can know what goes on there? Since your sister is a congregant it might be wise to see what the church is preaching because whether or not your children are attending the services, your sister is, and she is sharing those beliefs with your children.\n\nMaybe you should have asked more questions about the event before agreeing that your children could go if you were so concerned about who was sponsoring it.  But let's be honest, you are upset because your son drew a picture of his family without you, his mother, in it.  \n\nInstead of blowing up at your sister, talk to your son about how he is feeling.  I am sure he isn't so keen on having a part-time mother and no father anymore.  It has been a hell of a lot of changes for your kids as well.  And call your sister and apologize, she is not at fault here and has only been supportive of you and your kids.

I was indoctrinated in Catholicism my whole life, and after leaving the church I was very insistent that my child does not have any religion shoved down her throat. We educate her about religion, but she can choose her own when she\u2019s old enough to develop her own connection to one. However, your sister is absolutely correct. \n\n\nChurches host events all the time (Breakfast with Santa, Easter egg hunts, etc). Even though there may be some religious people at the events that leads to exposure to some religion, it is by no means akin to attending church. I have no doubt as an adult that you\u2019re aware of this, and I think you\u2019re grasping at straws for ways to blame your sister for the drawing your son made. \n\nIt is not your sister\u2019s fault that your son is viewing his family as his family. His aunt and uncle *are* his family, and it\u2019s worth mentioning **they** were the ones at the event! The drawing was \u201cdraw your family,\u201d and those were the family members that were there with your son. It was just a mindless drawing that your son did there and then, and I doubt it was meant to be intentionally hurtful. He just drew what he had going on at the time. \n\n\nI feel you\u2019re hurt about the drawing and trying to blame your sister for bringing him to the place the drawing was done by griping about religion, despite the fact that you\u2019re grown enough to know that wasn\u2019t really the case. Also, why didn\u2019t you go to the event? Why can\u2019t you pick your sons up every night? It\u2019s insane to me they spend so much time with your sister\u2019s family and you chose to give up more time instead of spending time with them at this event. If you had gone, you\u2019d probably be in the picture. \n\nYou\u2019re absent to your sons and you\u2019re ungrateful to your sister. Being a single mom is difficult (I know), but try to prioritize using the time you actually have and being grateful you actually have support like that, because the vast majority of us single parents do not have it. \n\nYour sons are going to resent you for pulling them from their family and sticking them with strangers and your son is going to blame himself because of the fuss you made from his picture.

Way more than that if you want someone half decent. I hope you\u2019re on time every single day to pick them up too because some of those places charge crazy late-pickup fees and will eventually kick you out if you\u2019re late too often. but this is all totally worth it to own your sister who\u2026took your kids to a field day hosted by a church. \n\nYTA but at least your sister doesnt have to watch six kids at a time anymore I guess? seems like more of a win for her than you, but we all have our hills to die on", "It was an event sponsored by the church, not church.

Many community organisations run Family Fun Days so I wouldn\u2019t have jumped to it being a church event either. \n\nAs for forgoing free childcare etc, being left out of the picture I\u2019d say was probably a wake up call for you to be more present in their lives and take back that role of parenting - even if it wasn\u2019t so much a conscious thought. It\u2019s often easier to go with the status quo if it\u2019s working and undoubtably your kids had been through a fair bit with their dad leaving as well so the stability of your sisters house would have been good for them.

Enjoy spending $$$ in daycare \ud83d\ude02. I don't think your sister loses at all in this situation. Less work for her.", "You didn't ask any questions about where they were going. It could have been an outdoor event with zero religion, but you don't know. This is on you. If it's a religious event, it's on your SIL and her husband.", "YTA\n\nFirst, from what you\u2019ve shared your sister has done nothing to \u201cturn your child against you.\u201d She and her husband have taken care of your kids and showed you all a lot of kindness. You\u2019re seizing on one thing you\u2019re unhappy with to assign bad intentions and cut them off. That\u2019s not ok. \n\nYour child drew a picture without you in it. I\u2019m sure that hurts but there could be many reasons for it, and it\u2019s up to YOU, his PARENT to have that conversation. It\u2019s not a situation that requires \u201cdefending you,\u201d not a conversation for your sister to have instead of you, and does not imply anyone had does anything to turn him against you. \n\nTalk to your kid about his feelings. PLEASE DON\u2019T SHAME HIM. Your kids have been going through a lot. Their dad abandoned them, and they only get to see their mom on weekends. They lost a lot all at once. If this is how he\u2019s expressing some of those feelings that needs to be allowed. You can process your feelings of hurt about it separately, where it won\u2019t impact him, because you\u2019re the adult and parent. \n\nIt could also be totally innocent. Maybe the assignment was \u201cdraw who you\u2019re with today.\u201d The point is you need to talk about it. \n\nWhen I was a kid I left my sister out of a family picture because she didn\u2019t live with us anymore. It wasn\u2019t intentional, it just happened because I was thinking about people I lived with. I felt awful when I realized I\u2019d done that. Sometimes kids think about things differently. \n\nFor the church piece, again YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT. Figure out if it was an honest mistake, which it truly sounds like it could be. You\u2019re so concerned about their church but know nothing about it, which is odd. By this time, you could have done some research or gone once to find out \u201cwhat goes on there\u201d so you can know what you really think about this specific church. You could have joined everyone for the field day or asked more questions ahead of time. Nothing you shared sounds like your sister actively tried to trick you or hide what the event was. If she didn\u2019t take your kids to church services and this is the first issue in all these months, it at least deserves a conversation. \n\nLastly, consider the impact on your kids. Their lives have had a lot of upheaval and loss lately. Even if they don\u2019t keep living with your sister and BIL during the week, they deserve some warning and to still spend time with the family. They\u2019ve lost their dad, barely see you as a result, adjusted to a new living and family situation, and now you\u2019re talking about taking that away from them too. They deserve some consideration and stability. The situation doesn\u2019t have to stay exactly what it\u2019s been, but a drastic change where they\u2019re with strangers instead of family all the time may not be it either. Talk to your kids.\n\nEdit: typos", "Soft YTA - I understand the hurt you must\u2019ve felt seeing that drawing. I also understand having to work extra hours as a single mom. My mom had 3 of us and had to do the same. Those slamming you for that clearly never were in that position. However, it sounds like you kept that arrangement going after the initial few weeks and even allowed the kids to stay on the weekends. They are with your sister more than they are with you. I don\u2019t think his drawing had anything to do with the event they attended and everything to do with the amount of time he\u2019s spending away from you. I think you really should cut your sister some slack because she has been helping you get on your feet and has obviously been very good to your kids. I\u2019m going to give her the benefit of the doubt that the activity was not religious. I attend events put on by churches with my kids that aren\u2019t religious, so if she says that\u2019s what it was, it may very well have been. You also said it was ok. Though as a mom, I understand your feelings, I do think you\u2019re overreacting. Not allowing your kids to see their family is only hurting them. I think instead, if you are now able to make ends meet, alter the arrangement and be with them more. I feel for you, I really do \u2026 being a single mom isn\u2019t easy and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re stuck between being present and paying the bills.

Your child is not against you and was not turned against you.\n\nChurches have a lot of community events. They don't even always happen at church. It's not like your children were taken to a church service.\n\nYour sister stepped in to help you when you really could have been screwed. You have help that many would love to have.\n\nStop being jealous. Your sister isn't trying to replace you.", "YTA- You went off the deep end because you weren't on a hand drawn picture? I doubt it was some dark conspiracy to alienate the kids against you. Talk with your sister and don't be so all-fired self righteous. She's doing you a huge favor keeping your kids for you while you get back on your feet. The least you can do is hear her side of the story. May as well learn to swallow a little of that pride now; sounds like you'll be swallowing more, with your attitude.", "YTA.\nYour sister has gone above and beyond to help you and then you carry on about a picnic. \nSeriously lady...", "YTA.  I am not a religious person at all and would be annoyed if my religious family took my children to religious events if I had told them not to.  However, I do think a field day hosted by the church is different than actually taking them to the church.  You were aware they were going to a family field day and were okay with it until you heard the sponsor.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same thing.\n\nRegardless, your family has really stepped up to help you out in a time of need and your children seem really happy and comfortable.  Because of the mentioning of the picture and your comments to your sister, it really seems like the picture is what hurts you the most and that is not your sister\u2019s fault.  There is nothing she can do to change that and not making your child feel badly about the picture does not mean she wants your child to not think of you as family.  In fact, her commenting on the picture and \u201ccorrecting\u201d your child might just have made your child feel rejected and unwanted, which would not have been a good thing.  Also, they are family!  It doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t also family.\n\nNow you need to move forward and do what is best for your kid.  If you feel sad that you think they don\u2019t think of you as family, make more effort to connect with them and take more of an active role in their life if you have the time.  If you don\u2019t want them going to church-adjacent activities even if they are not inherently religious, make that clear moving forward.  But don\u2019t punish your children by taking away people they care about and their stability and consistency just because your feelings are hurt.", "YTA for overreacting, but it is time for this arrangement to change/end. 5 days a week is not babysitting. 5 days a week is being the custodial parent. Ideally, you would have dialed back them watching your kids to the afternoons until you are out of work, instead of immediately yanking them out of the stable home your sister is providing.\n\nListen, I do not like when my MIL talks religion to my kid, but that isn't actually what you are mad about here. You are mad at yourself for allowing this to continue because 5 days a week you got to act like you are single with no kids. You need to prioritize your children and what is best for them here. I don't know yet what is best for them, but it's clear you are not prioritizing it.", "YTA for all reasons mentioned by others already. But also;  Is \u201ccut your nose off to spite your face\u201d a biblical expression? I don\u2019t remember.

Sure, your sister didn\u2019t directly ask your permission, but your kids told you they were going to a Family Field Day which makes me wonder why more info wasn\u2019t asked before giving your approval for them to go. Technically, your permission was provided in the eyes of your sister, who - focusing on facts, not feelings or assumptions - informed you that she did not consider this a church event and therefore is following your one rule. \n\nAll it takes is a \u201cListen sis, when you took the kids to the church event I felt hurt. I\u2019d like, moving forward, if we could discuss the activities or events you take my kids to so we\u2019re on the same page\u201d instead of isolating your kids from their seemingly loving and caring family members. \n\nAlso: he\u2019s a kid - I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ill intent behind his drawing.

You don't provide any evidence that this \"church event\" was like \"church\". \n\nI disc golf on a church's property and they hold events there and all sorts of disc golfers go there and they don't push religion at all at these things so I can believe it was not \"churchy\" unless you can say otherwise.", "YTA, it was an event sponsored by a church, not mass", "YTA.

Your sister may genuinely not have thought you considered that going to church. It does not sound malicious at all on her part. She is watching your kids 5 out of 7 days of the week so you can try to get financially secure. Most people could only dream of that level of support. Unfortunately, given that your kids spend over twice the amount of time with your sister as they do with you, it is natural that they are going to put her in family drawings. I\u2019m sure your sister did not ask him to that, she did not turn him against you. You did that when you left them at someone else\u2019s house almost all week. I understand why you did it, but I bet the kids feel a little hurt that their mom (in their eyes) doesn\u2019t want to be with them.", "Whoever came up with the name Caitrin is TA.", "YTA. You took your kids away from stability during a really tumultuous time. I\u2019m not faulting you for needing to work and needing childcare, this seems like a rough time for you as well.

Hopefully, you can get back on your feet and start spending more time with your kids again soon.", "YTA OP and you\u2019re being very ungrateful.  I don\u2019t like religion, either\u2014 but you are way overreacting.  But hey, now you\u2019ll have to work harder and spend more money on childcare.

I'm sorry your boyfriend left and turned you into a single mother of four children, but you were so fortunate to have a sister willing to care for four additional children as well as her own so that you could work more hours. I'm not a big fan of organized religion either, but you have no right to dictate your sister's life. If she wants to take her family to a field day organized by her church she should get to go. Its only natural that the kids learned about it and wanted to go too and that's probably how this all came about.\n\nTechnically a \"family field day\" is not church even if sponsored by a church. You overreacted out of jealousy. Whatever you may think your sister and her husband have done, they ARE your kid's family. Who do they spend the most time with? Look at this from your kids point of view. They just want a normal family life and you get jealous when they have it. You would rather send your kids to daycare than have relatives make them feel part of a family. What you have done is childish, selfish, and self-serving. You need to apologize to your sister and have a heart to heart with the kids.", "You are the absolute huge asshole. I've read all your comments.\n\nYou. Are. Not. Their. Parent.\n\nYou are their biological mother but you do fuck all with and for them. \n\nOf course your son doesn't see you as his mom. You're not raising them in the slightest. You basically dumped them to your sister. If you want them to feel like you are their mother, why don't you pick them up after work? That makes literally 0 sense to me.\n\nYou have no responsibility over your own children. And I can garuntee when you are with them on the weekends, you are counting down the hours until they're gone again.", "This is a joke, right?\n\nReligion has nothing to do with this. I\u2019m uncomfortable with children going to church as well and believe things like Sunday school can be very damaging and indoctrinating to kids.\n\nThat said, OF COURSE yta. You got free childcare for FOUR children for months on end! Your sister TRIPLED the number of children under her care at no expense to you (and lemme tell you, a couple of free trips to the zoo ain\u2019t even close to showing your appreciation - maybe offer to watch all six kids for them for a weekend or two for a change!). Your kids went out of their way to ask you if they could go to an event with the cousins, aunt, and uncle they\u2019ve come to love and see as their primary caregivers (which they now ARE) which seems to be only marginally religiously affiliated ONE time (by the way, if it\u2019s that important to you, you could easily have gotten more information about this event beforehand or even *gasp* gone WITH your kids to it) and your kid drew a picture you\u2019re not in (that he himself chose to draw, no one put him up to it) and now you won\u2019t even speak to her?? Damn. Not only are you the AH, you\u2019re being a child.\n\nStep up and be a parent. Get over yourself and don\u2019t ruin a relationship with a good sister over your petty insecurities. Just remember - this is the behavior you\u2019re modeling for your children. And as you seem to know - what children absorb at a young age is important to their development and mental health. I won\u2019t argue and say religion isn\u2019t damaging to children. What I will say is few things are more damaging and traumatic than removing your kids from a healthy, stable situation among well-meaning and loving family.

Your children have been loved and supported and cared for by your sister, how is that possibly a bad thing?\n\nYou\u2019re splitting hairs between \u201cchurch services\u201d and a \u201cchurch social function\u201d because you\u2019re upset. Could the social function *also* use indoctrination towards your kids, yes, but you haven\u2019t seen any signs of religious indoctrination from what you\u2019ve described here. The fact is religious organizations provide extended social support and community, which your children (and you) can absolutely benefit from beyond just your sisters household.\n\nNo one is trying to turn your kids against you (from what you have written here), they are trying to be there for your kids and support you while you get through this incredibly difficult time. \n\n**I could absolutely be wrong**, but Your reactions sounds like betrayal trauma, and understandably so.

Your kids lost their 1st family unit when your ex left, and since then you've only been there for them part time (weekends).

You weren't replaced. Please don't make your son feel bad for loving more people and not including you in everything he does.

They can't control who the sponsors for the event are and can't control what your son draws. They're being there for you and you're just choosing to be petty.\n\nNot wanting them taken to church, is fine. But blaming your sister for something out of her control and punishing her for your son enjoying time with them, is just you being blatantly scared and jealous, which sure is understandable, but you should not be taking it out on her at all.\n\nReally? You'd rather your kids go to daycare vs be with loving family, because you're jealous? This time must be insanely hard for your kids too and you're not around to get them through it. They need and have family and you're willing to let your jealousy emotionally harm them.\n\nAre you paying them? If it's for free, then you're an even bigger AH.

She has them for a grand total of 48 hours a week and sacrificed a big chunk of that time. No wonder the kid didn\u2019t include her in the picture. He\u2019s old enough to know that mom\u2019s off on the weekend since that\u2019s the only time they go there, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was wondering why she didn\u2019t come the same way I am.\n\nI just feel really bad for the kids.

I get that she might be desperate for help, but no mention of wrestling with that choice at all or any reservations aside from just expecting someone in a culty church to not take their kids to said church.

Instead of cutting her children off from their aunt, she should reassure her children that she tries to be there for them as much as she can and bond with them as much as she can.", "Yeah. It seems her only argument for not wanting her kids to go to church things is because she doesn\u2019t \u201cknow what goes on there.\u201d So\u2026maybe find out? Go and see? I\u2019m not a church person by any means, but it would hurt her 0% to go check out some of the sponsored events so she does, in fact, know what goes on there.", "It wasn't breaking the rule. This was not a religious service or even held in a church building. The vast majority of church sponsored events are essentially charity work to support the community. If OP actually had a conversation with her sister, she would have been able to find out what it was like and if anything went on that she found objectionable. \n\nIf the children are spending so much time with their aunt and uncle, it's likely they would be encountering a bunch of church members anyway since they presumably socialize with them. If OP trusts her sister with doing so much child care, she should trust her to use her judgement. If OP has a concern she should address it and not throw a tantrum like a child and cut off people who are important to her children.", "Not to mention that the kids went from having their own family to their dad leaving and then being essentially given to their aunt and uncle. Their entire world was turned upside down.", "Yes, and it\u2019s also telling that OP described their other sister as \u201clives abroad and therefore is no help\u201d.", "I\u2019m not sure how OP expects her sister to be able to attend church and their events if her children are forbidden to go. Unless she actually expects her sister\u2019s family not to attend when they have her kids, which is pretty much all the time.", "OP has been a weekend only parent for a long time now. The kids see the aunt and uncle as parents and stability.", "I just learned about a Christian soccer club near me last fall. I had no idea and my kid has been playing soccer for years. They started it because the other soccer clubs in the area charge thousands of dollars to join their travel teams, this league it's a few hundred and there are grants for kids who can't pay. They do have crosses on their uniforms, but honestly, when she ages out of the town league, it's an option.", ">All churches are cults\n\nSo you don't know what a cult is", "right, but they weren't. So the question remains.", "She could\u2019ve went to the family event with her kids.", "Who knows what the kids think is actually happening. \n\nWonder where the ex-boyfriend/dad is? \n\nIs he seeing them at all? Hmmmmm.", "Sadly if the Sister's family has bonded with the kids (which is most likely by now) it would probably hurt them.", "So the kid realized he has a new mom and dad after both of his ditched him. Nothing wrong with that", "You wouldn\u2019t be upset if your kid drew a family picture that didn\u2019t include you as the parent? Regardless of the arrangements for childcare purposes, OP is still the kid\u2019s mother!", "OP is jealous.", "Listen, there are cults, and there are dangerous cults. Dangerous cults end with mass suicide and violence and all that. Regular cults - the real definition of the word - is a common ideology shared amongst members of the cult. So, in that sense, sports fans of a particular team are in a cult. Followers of a particular political view can be a cult. Cults in and of themselves are not bad. It's just that the dangerous cults have given the word a bad name.", "Yes, these kids were ditched by both parents at the same time and just have weekend visits with biomom.", "This doesn\u2019t sound like \u201cbabysitting\u201d to me, it sounds like the kids are living with their aunt & uncle M-F and only visiting their mom on weekends. Look at it from the 11 year old\u2019s perspective. Dad seems to have bailed completely, and mom shipped you off to live with other relatives. These kids have essentially been abandoned by BOTH parents. I get needing to work extra hours but her kids were already losing a parent, she should have been supporting them and reassuring them that she would never leave. Even if it wasn\u2019t convenient, she should have been bringing them home after work or at the very least stopping by DAILY. If she worked nights she could do the school pickups or help with homework or something. The kid left mom out of the drawing for the same reason his dad isn\u2019t there: both parents are CHOOSING not to be there for these kids.", "No, because I'm secure in myself. I might think of it as a notice that I should step up my game as a parent, but I wouldn't get upset and rage at my sister.", "Then she should act like it.\n\nObviously the child is not spending much time with its mother.\n\nMom needs to focus on her children.", "Then she needs to parent them. She's dumping her children 5 days a week. She gets no sympathy if her children see their aunt and uncle as their parents. That's her own failure.", "Of course it's upsetting for her, but how is that the sisters fault? The kids have spent the majority of their time with her, at OPs request, since December. I feel for OP in the sense of feeling like she has to work all the time and doesn't have time to be with them anymore, I'm sure that's hard. But lashing out at her sister who has been taking care of her children for months while they live with her practically full time because they naturally grew closer to her as a result is unfair, and separating them so suddenly and dramatically out of spite is not fair to the kids either.", "You can't be that upset when you an absent parent. Just about as bad as dad.", "but she is not acting as a parent, she is just the person that picks them up for the weekend.  Who tucks them into bed 5 nights a week, who is putting bandaids on their scraped knees, and who is keeping them fed and getting them dressed? she is not parenting these kids, she is just a person with weekend visits at this point", "So why didn\u2019t OP stay with them? Attend the event as a family?\n\n\u201cSure yeah you can spend the weekend, and I\u2019d love to spend it with you because we don\u2019t see each other much during the week, we can all go together\u201d \n\nThe fact is the kids have clearly grown more attached to OPs sister than they are ti OP, because for the last half a year they\u2019ve seen them more. The poor kids have already seen their father abandon them, and at the same time their mother disappears for all but two days a week? Of course their going to think the worst, they\u2019re kids.", "No, it's the failure of the father who jumped ship and left her to pay for and care for 4 kids. But sure, she can just quit her job and... Lose their home, not be able to feed them, have to sell her car and then they can all be homeless and starving together.\n\nHonestly, what the hell is your solution here? Or are you just a teenager who has no idea what it means to raise children? Likely.", "She\u2019s also working to provide them with a home. It\u2019s either them or a daycare.", "Fucking exactly.", "Theology is a toxic idea", "I don't know the best solution to this situation, but I know that blaming the ones that are helping you for the lack of love of your children it's not one of them. She said that they are turning her kids against her, but she doesn't know if that's true. The only thing that she knows for sure is that her kids don't see her as their mother figure anymore, and there's good reason for that (even if she doesn't have another option, life is a shit sometimes)", "I'm a mom who works full time and has her child full time. I parent at all times except when I'm at work. I don't abandon him 5 days a week and then show up as weekend parent.\n\nWhat world do you live in where parents only parent on weekends due to responsibilities? Children are the #1 responsibility, so good parents typically have them in their care except for a few hours a day to work.", "OP is just as bad as her baby daddy. She isn't even paying her sister child support or for child care when her sister is now the one raising these 4 children. OP is throwing a tantrum over a picture. OP needs to get her damn priorities straight instead of whining on the internet. OP needs to sue her baby daddies for child support.", "Gee, the mom didn\u2019t have any problems quickly enrolling her kids in daycare did she?", "She will have to drop off/pick up at daycare every day. And then she'll have to mom in the evenings. Right now, she's a weekend parent and isn't in their life from M-f. That's not how day cares work.", "Having been raised catholic, I was about to get big mad at this statement before it turned around to saying \"catholic fits the confines of cult.\"", "So it's a \"normalized\" cult with lots of members.", "It\u2019s not a good reason.  For anyone. OP doesn\u2019t get to choose to be absent, then get mad when the kids notice she\u2019s absent. If she truly wants to be present and can send them to daycare, she should have already done that.", "Honestly if OP was JUST using them to babysit outside of school hours she would be not TA but it sounds like (and if I'm wrong please correct me OP) the kids are living with their Aunt and Uncle throughout the week. I get it's hurtful to see how your kid views you as absentee parent, but that's exactly what OP is being. \n\nHonestly she's lucky. Hopefully this is a wakeup call and she re-engages with her children in a meaningful way. Her sister could possibly pursue legal guardianship if she doesn't. Maybe her sis is encouraging it, but nothing given so far indicates they are attempting parental alienation. OP is doing the parental alienation to herself.", "How\u2019s your life working while taking care of four kids? What\u2019s the scheduling like?", "Well, let's see. Say she works until 5 or 6pm, let's give a 30 minute commute from her work to her sisters place and then another 30 minutes home. So they're home by 6/7pm. That's fine, she gets an hour with the 3 y/o, 2 with the older ones (she is cooking and cleaning though). Then in the morning, so either a 9am or 10am start, factor in an 1.5 hours to get to her sisters, drop off and then work, they're leaving the house at 7.30/8.30am, up at 6am to get everyone ready and packed for the day. Doable, sure. But where's the quality time? Between making dinner, cleaning, packing, unpacking, getting ready, making breakfast and lunches, where is exactly is she getting quality time in?? And this is if commute is only 30 minutes each between her house, sisters and work. Depending on where they live, it could be 1+ hours. We really do not have enough info to make any judgement on what kind of parent she is or why they have this arrangement.\n\nChildren are #1, but you can't provide for children on thoughts and prayers so OP has to, unfortunately, work to ensure her kids have a home, etc. But I mean, you're the perfect parent who spends 24 hours of every day with your kid(s) so, congratulations?", "So in your opinion are parents who serve in the army and aren\u2019t home for long periods of time deadbeats? How about truckers? Parents who work at remote locations because it pays better without uprooting the whole family? Individuals who live in low income areas so their kids stay with grandparents to attend better schools? \nThere is a lot of information we don\u2019t know. She maybe a dead beat mom. But she may also be someone who has dealt a shitty hand. She wasn\u2019t a single parent when she had the kids. So arguing that you shouldn\u2019t have kids if you can\u2019t parent/support them is a blanket statement to ignore the fact that sometimes, life doesn\u2019t happen as you\u2019d expect. And Comparing your experience to theirs cheapens their experience and your credibility. \nTo use this case with limited information to support the \u201cpeople need to grow up or not have babies\u201d argument only serves to prove you have a chip on you\u2019re shoulder for some reason.", "try having a desk job and have enough for 4 kids and yourself, she probably works much more than that", "Ah yes, it's so easy to get child support. My mom tried for ~13 years before giving up because my bio dad evaded, took only cash jobs, etc so he didn't have to pay any, and it worked! It's incredibly easy to evade child support lol. \n\nDid her sister ask to be paid? Why are people hung up on this? Unless there was an agreement or sister wanted money, this is a moot point. OP is, rightfully, concerned her children are seeing their aunt and uncle as parents and cutting her out so she is severing that care agreement to prevent this. Would you be saying the same if it was joint custody and the father and his new family were doing this? At worst, this is parental alienation.", "I was confused by the daycare comment she made. She has 3 school aged kids, and they should be in school, unless they are home schooled and that\u2019s a lot to ask of an aunt and uncle.", "Lots of HUSBANDS barely see their kids ALL week but people don't day they are not a proper parent."]}
