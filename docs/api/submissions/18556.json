My sister and her husband - Caitrin and Ian - worked out a plan to babysit my kids for part of the week for a few weeks so I could work extra hours and get back on my feet. They would keep the kids Monday - Friday and I would have them on the weekends. The kids enjoyed it and they got to play with my sister's kids - ages 9 and 7 - so we kept the arrangement going.\n\nThis weekend everything hit the fan. My ONLY rule was that my sister and her husband were not to take my kids to their church because I don't know what goes on there. Well, on Friday my kids asked if they could stay the weekend with my sister and she and her husband were okay with it because they were going to a \"Family Field Day\". I said it was fine. When I got them back on Saturday I was helping my kids unpack and my 11 year old had a card he supposedly made at the field day event. He was supposed to draw his family and he drew Caitrin and Ian with himself and his siblings followed by Caitrin and Ian's kids. I wasn't on the picture.\n\nI asked him about it and that's when I found out the field day was actually a church event. I called my sister. Her excuses were that it was sponsored by the church but was not at the church or even considered a church event which I don't believe. I also asked her about the picture and she said she saw it but didn't talk to my kid about it. I told her how hurt I was because she and Ian are okay with me being replaced in my son's mind.\n\nI hung up and a while later sent her the following message: \"Your services will no longer be needed. I'm enrolling the kids in daycare. Thanks for everything.\"\n\nShe asked if we could talk again and I said maybe later. I told our other sister (who lives abroad and therefore is no help) and she said I am being an AH and said I need to talk to Caitrin but I disagree.

No offense but what did you expect when your children are with them five days a week ? \n\nThey took your kids in to help. They had no obligation to help.  Your sister and her husband didn't do anything. They cared for and loved your kids.\n\nFor the record she didn't turn your kids against you. Not at all\nEditing. They didn't take them to church services. But an event sponsored by the church. There's quite a big difference there.", "Two questions:\n\nHow is your sister turning your children against you?\n\nHow is your sister less of a parent to these kids than you are if she takes care of them 5/7 days of the week?", "Yta - I would take no church as services or sermon. So you should define your rules clearly.\n\n2nd.. so you abandon your kids 5 out of 7 days a week and your \u201churt\u201d that your kids are forming stronger relationships/family bonds with their caretakers? They are more parents to the children than you atm bc being a parent requires you to be there and you\u2019re not there. \n\n3rd I\u2019m confused did you not want the children to think of your family as their family? Are you confused and thought your family had any control over what your kids are drawing? Did you want your family to dictate what your kids draw?\n\nAlso\u2026 doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re paying your family for raising your kids for you\u2026 so in what world are your considered not an AH? Free help and You\u2019re mad? Talk about ungrateful.", "YTA, It seems like your more upset that your son drew a picture with the people he spends the majority of the time with rather than it being a church event, and your reaction is to take him away from people that he clearly cares a lot about.", "Jeez you really do expect a lot for nothing but aggravation in return. Four children, Five days a week and you\u2019re complaining AND you have snubbed your VERY successful, VERY reliable support system. \n\nI don\u2019t attend church either, but I sure wouldn\u2019t be taking this stance with the people who have had your back when you needed it. \n\nEnjoy paying for child care and running yourself ragged because you refuse to give your sister the benefit of the doubt. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. How exactly are you planning to pay for 5 days a week of day care? Your sister did you a massive favor. She didn't take the kids TO church but rather to a church event. If you're really going to tell someone who is watching your kids for free that they can't do anything church related FIVE DAYS A WEEK, then yeah, you're the TA here.\n\nYou say you \"don't know what goes on there\" but how do you know what goes on at a daycare? Do your kids enjoy the time with your sister and her family? Because it seems to me like you're upset about the drawing and parlaying that into somehow your sister turning your kids against you, which is ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nShe didn't talk to your son about the picture because that is solidly a conversation your son should be having with his *parent*.  Which, as you make sure to note, is not your sister.  But you can't have it both ways: you want her to do the heavy lifting of parenting while still getting all the credit in your kids' minds.  The problem here is not your sister.  It's that your kids are too smart for this.  They have seen your sister do the lion's share of their parenting, and now they're expressing that in their art.  And you, the parent, need to talk to them about this.\n\nRather than step in and alienate you by taking your parenting duties from you, your sister gave you the space to have this conversation with your kid.  But when given the opportunity to step up and be a parent, you complained about that too.  Your sister can't win for trying.\n\nThe Family Field Day was a miscommunication.  Your sister could have been more forthcoming with the details, but you also should be ASKING for those details before sending your kids.  It doesn't sound like the did anything maliciously, and as the parent, I do think the onus is on YOU to ask for details before deciding to send your kids to events.", "YTA.\n\nThis has nothing to do with any church at all.\n\nYou decided to leave your kid 5 days \u00e0 week for about 6 months now. You have kind of become the fun aunt and your sister and BIL the parent providing stability and confort to your kids. \n\nWhat else did you expect ?", "YTA. You\u2019re losing your mind (and possibly ruining a wonderful, stable childcare situation) over something trivial/invented in your own mind. \n\nI am an atheist. My kids have participated in all kinds of church-sponsored community events because they\u2019re really fun. \n\nThe picture your kid drew sounds like it represents the family that was with him that day. It IS a picture of his family, but you jumping to the conclusion that you not being in it means he somehow doesn\u2019t think of you family is not reasonable and shows some major insecurities in your part.", "YTA. You're blaming your sister for a situation caused by the fact that the kids are there 5 days a week. The church thing (which wasn't even a church thing) is not relevant to this at all, outside of the fact that your kid happened to draw a picture there. Maybe talk to your kids about why they don't feel close to you and seek family counseling. Depriving your kids of seeing their cousins and your siblings isn't going to help, it's going to make them resent you.", "YTA. They didn't take the kids to church, and your children clearly like being over there with them. You sound like you're just punishing your children for preferring people who are actually there for them.", "YTA were the kids staying over at their house 5 days per week? Surely there\u2019s no need for that. You can\u2019t blame them as they see your sister more than you.", "This reads as the non custodial parent (you), getting upset that the custodial parent (your sister & her hubby) gets drawn in a family picture and not you.\n\nEven when \"on your feet\" you decided to keep the arrangement going. This is not your sister purposely trying to alienate you from your kids, this is your children acclimating to the family unit they are now a part of the majority of the week.\n\nSorry but YTA, you were clearly okay with this setup of not seeing your own children 5 days out of 7 otherwise you would have taken them back as soon as you could. Blame \"church\" all you want, but the whole thing falls on you.\n\nBy completely cutting the children off from their aunt, you will be harming them emotionally.  \nTheir father it seems has already cut them off as there is no mention where he fits into this, you partially cut them off, now the family that they have been a part of you want to take away.\n\nYou need to think about this long and hard. In the meantime go to court and get some child support to help offset you working 7 days a week & spend some quality time with your kids.", "YTA for not taking the kids into consideration or talking with your sister first", "YTA, and just threw away the best babysitting option you had because of your own insecurities.\n\nThe picture isn\u2019t your sister\u2019s fault. I hesitate to say it\u2019s your \u201cfault\u201d, because it sounds like you\u2019re doing the best you can in terms of childcare, but you need to grow up and recognize that there was nothing malicious in your kid\u2019s picture. **No one has \u201cturned him against you\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s you projecting because you feel sad or guilty about not being able to spend as much time with your kids as you think you should.**\n\nAs for the church thing, it doesn\u2019t sound like the event was religious in nature. But you refused to believe your sister, either because you have trust issues with her in general or because you were already feeling spiteful about her time with the kids and wanted to add another reason to be mad at her.

If it\u2019s he first one, why would you have let her look after your kids in the first place?", "YTA. \n\nYour sister and her husband have been raising the kids for months and you have had weekend visitation. You chose to continue this because the kids were thriving and happy. Now you pulled that away from them because you are upset about a picture? And how is your sister \"turning your kids against you?\" Nothing she has done has turned them against you. \n\nBTW, did you pat child support or childcare costs for those months? Did you provide food for your kids every day? Did you pay for any activities they did?", "YTA. Your sister is in no way turning your kids against you. You are doing it yourself, by abandonning your kids 5 days a week.

I get the hurt, but church had nothing to do with it, and honestly, neither did your sister. It's how the kid's seeing his world, and it hurts you to know that's how he sees his world, but that's honestly no one's fault. That's just being a single mom that has to work. I grew up with one.

Big time. \n\nThat field day doesn\u2019t even sound like a church event. Sponsored or not. And your feelings on the picture, while somewhat valid (because who wouldn\u2019t be disheartened by that?), are misdirected. Your son\u2019s been spending the majority of his time, by a wide margin, with his aunt and cousins. He drew a picture reflecting that. Instead of talking with him about it, or maybe promising to spend some more time together, you react emotionally and elect to remove the closest ties he has to other family members. Oh, and you manage to blame your sister and blame her to boot, despite her taking care of your kids for 5 days a week, every week. Is that free, btw? Yeah, YTA. \n\nI\u2019m not getting on you for \u201cabandoning\u201d your kids, because based on your info, you\u2019re not.

As for the drawing, the aunt and uncle are part of OP\u2019s child\u2019s family so that shouldn\u2019t be a problem either.", "This particular church or the particular religion? I have been to events sponsored by a church that were not religious. \nI feel like your sister could have given you a heads up and I also feel like you could have asked. I'd have at least asked where it was, just because where I live I think of \"field days\" as a school thing.", "Thank you! And how many other church events were you not told of. More lies told to your kids will come out. Daycare and distance is what is needed. Also therapy for any brainwashing down by your sister or the church.", "She is watching six kids, four of which are not her own - did you expect her to regularly review and chat with each of them about what they choose to draw? Did you want her to make your child feel bad about his choice on how to self-express?", "How much time do you actually spend with your kid? Have you ever considered that since he spends more time around his aunt he\u2019s more attached to her than you. Plus needlessly taking that away will not only damage your relationship with your sister but also probably further damage your relation with your son. Have you ever thought that this is a sign to reevaluate how much time you actually spend with your kid instead of blaming your sister for helping you out for free might I add.", "Wow. It\u2019s almost like she was uncomfortable correcting YOUR child and perhaps did not want to make your son feel rejected or that it was your place as his parent to clarify your role in his life.", "You replied to my comment but decided to not answer either of my questions?", "Gifts for your sister isn\u2019t time spent with your child. You now know how he sees you in his world. That isn\u2019t your sister or her family\u2019s fault.", "I know where you're from. I live in a small rural southern community where Church is far from the only place for sermons and judgments.  If you told them no church they probably knew what you meant but in some places there's not much to do that isn't church affiliated.  I don't blame you for being upset especially if your churches are the bible-slapping pits of bigotry that most around where I live are.  \n\nBut this is your sister that has been very good to you and has helped when you needed it most.  You should at least sit down and talk to her.  Air out your feelings and, maybe, if it's at all possible, spend more time with your kids so they spend less time being a part of someone else's family.\n\nNAH.", "I wouldn't consider living with someone five days out of seven babysitting. She basically shares custody of her children with her sister. Op doesn't even provide money for food for all her children. Only the child who is Gluten free. She's letting someone else raise her kids. This isn't her sister watches them before and after school. They live with her sister for the majority of the week.", "The kid drew a family photo, not a religious one, and churches can and do host non-religious family events... bit of a reach to call it a cult when the mum is letting her young kids effectively be raised by them (Monday-Friday is not \"part of the week\", it's the majority of it).", "The sister didn't take her to the church. If OP cared so much she could have easily looked into this family event her sister was taking her children to during the only time she gets with her children, or maybe even gone with them...\n\nWay to paint every church as evil there, there is no evidence that this church is doing anything of the sort, maybe leave your prejudices at the door.", "And camps start registration in the winter and fill up fast. I guess she could have them wait listed but I wouldn't count on it. And get on lists for before and after care. And pay for all of that. Most parents have summer care lined up long before summer.", "I have enough money for daycare now since I've been able to save up. We have daycares that go up to age 12 around here.", "Why is it her job to have that conversation with your child?  Why is it her responsibility to defend you to your child?  \n\nThe short answer is: it isn't.  \n\nYour child drew a picture.  There are many innocent reasons why he may have drawn the picture he did that do not involve any commentary on your parenting.  He might have just drawn \"the people I was here with today\", who happen to be a subset of his family, so it made sense to him to represent his family like that in this context.  Or, he might really be struggling with the situation.\n\nBut it's on YOU as the parent to have that conversation with your child.  Your sister was right not to open up that can of worms and leave that to you.  Depending on what the reasoning is for his picture, that conversation might need to be with a parent.  And rather than ruin everyone's day by making it an issue, your sister saved that parenting conversation and that parenting work for you.  \n\nNon-parents should leave potentially big conversations to the parents to handle.  That's the right call.  Your sister did that.  Yes, she left you with all the work in this situation, but that work is *parenting* and she was right to leave it to you.  You, and no one else besides you, should be having this conversation with your son.", "That\u2019s your conversation to have with your son, not her conversation. This reflects what what going on with your kid that day in his mind - it\u2019s nothing your sister did. If he was out at that event with you and his siblings, I\u2019m sure he would have drawn you. But your kids now see your sister and her family as their \u201csecond family\u201d - which is a really good thing, given your circumstances. It\u2019s not surprising if they spend five days a week there. It does not mean your sister is alienating them from you in any way, just that she is loving and caring for them. Don\u2019t damage your kids because of this. And definitely do talk to your sister. Maybe you can find a way for you to spend more time with your kids.", "It\u2019s not her job to guilt trip your kid about not drawing you, or to tell him who to draw. His feelings about the situation is also something she isn\u2019t obligated to sort through on your behalf.", "You weren\u2019t in the picture because you\u2019re their biological mom, but not their main caregiver. If you want to be in the picture, you shouldn\u2019t have shipped them of. I wouldn\u2019t have defended you either. What could she have said? You need to put the woman who visits you in the weekend in the picture, because she gave birth to you?", "So did I and had dogma spewed at me as a child. Sounds like you are apologists instead of thinking about the boundaries of a single mom. The sister isn\u2019t the parent.", "They very much did NOT take the kids to church. Church-sponsored? Yes. Church-localized? No. Also, what if the kids WANT to go to church??", "That's still not remotely covering the cost of raising 4 kids. \n\nAnd money/odd gifts they know is really (very) partial payback to their aunt for the free childcare isn't how you get kids to feel loved. They know the difference between that and you being there.\n\nAnd if you can afford daycare you can afford to be there a bit more.", "People are salty because you\u2019re female and not just taking on the motherly roll. You are both parents. Your kids need distance. SIL is a proven liar and by the picture they are icing you out.", "So it really seems here like your stereotyping her church and glopping together all churches and religions. I am not religious and don\u2019t go but I\u2019ve been to events with my kids hosted by churches for the community and with friends who attend church. Is there something her church has done to you or said that makes you feel this way? \n\nIf not, YTA not only because it was just a field day event, but because you\u2019re insulting your sisters church by behaving so strongly about something that was not a religious service. Like her religion is a disease. Also it isn\u2019t your sisters job to police your kids drawing. He drew who was with him that was family that day. So you weren\u2019t in it? He\u2019ll draw other pictures that will and won\u2019t have you in them. You sound very insecure. Seek therapy.", "> Church run events and sponsored events always have a religious undertone and also the people who judge single moms. \n\nAs an atheist I've gone to church run events that don't have religious undertones, it depends entirely on the church.\n\nAlso, OP said the told the sister and the husband \"Don't take my kids to church\", the kids weren't at church. If I asked my sister to watch my kids every weekday while I'm at work for 6 months but specified \"Don't bring them to your church\" I would not be this annoyed at them going to a *church run event*. I would just tell my sister that going forward I would prefer they don't go to anything involving her church. This would cover going to church and any church run/sponsored events, while also understanding how there was a miscommunication.", "You're not going to tell me a church that has money to stage an event is not going to interfere with whatever message this event carries out. I'm an atheist, but I know very well religious people are masters at shoving their religion in the faces of people who do not share their beliefs. \n\nOf course it's okay for the boy to include his aunt and uncle in his drawing - no surprises there, as they help raising him - but excluding his mom? It's not like the mom is absent or unloving. This is the church' doing.", "That's such horseshit. Church's are INCAPABLE of not shoving their beliefs in everyone's face. I grew up around those \"church family day activities\" too and you can't go more than 30 mins without a fucking prayer circle.", "What do you consider religious? I consider anything sponsored to be an event tax evading cults with ulterior motives.", "ALL religions are cults, I am sure you are aware of this fact", "Church was the mothers boundary. Just because you don\u2019t believe all religious isn\u2019t a cult doesn\u2019t give Sister the right to break the rule. There\u2019s no difference between church or sponsored. It\u2019s still a church event which will have a bunch of church members.", "Op could have easily asked to tag along to the event and then dipped out with the kids if it wasn't her cup of tea.", "So if you're kids start drawing the daycare provider, are you going to take them out of daycare too?", "So on top of neglecting them yourself, you want to take the people who do actually take care of them away too? That\u2019s cruel. Why take them to daycare when there are people who love them and have been taking care of them for so long. Don\u2019t you understand how hard that would be for them?", "Shame you didn\u2019t think to pay your sister that money and keep the reliable family child care situation you had. \n\nWell, at least your kids probably won\u2019t feel emotionally close to the people running the daycare. Then you won\u2019t have to be weirdly jealous of their affection.", "Good. Put them in and go no contact. I couldn\u2019t imagine my sister breaking the one rule I set and then was promoting parent alienation. Keep both sisters away.", "I really hope you\u2019re never abandoned by your partner. Very terrible take. Op didn\u2019t abandon her kids. Sister took her kids to a church, who I wouldn\u2019t be surprised talks poorly of OP being a single mother.", "Then maybe the parent should actually parent instead of pawning her kids off on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.", "The mum seems happy letting the sister be the parent the majority of the time when it suits her... also sorry you had to experience that, but it won't be a universal experience.", "If he excluded his mom, that\u2019s a reflection of what\u2019s going on in OP\u2019s household. My degree is in psychology and in my coursework, I focused on children. A child\u2019s drawings are indicative of how they see the world around them. If OP\u2019s child sees his aunt as more of a parental figure than OP that has nothing to do with religion. That\u2019s the child\u2019s reality. As for your first point, one of the tenants of Christianity is to do good work without t an earthly reward. I would say hosting a free event for the community is good work. The church is exercising its principles by having this event but it\u2019s no different than if a non profit organization did the same thing. You can live out your beliefs for your personal benefit and fulfillment without trying to indoctrinate someone else.", "Sorry but I disagree. I\u2019ve attended several of these events throughout my life at a variety of churches some denominational, some non denominational. Some of the events were even on church property. While it was known that a church was sponsoring the event, religion was not a component. It was all about doing something nice for the community and the only time religion was mentioned was when an attendee brought it up.", "If the event involved non optional religious activities. Hula hoops not religious, scripture reading religious.", "I've been abandoned by my partner. He chose drugs and another woman who would do those drugs with him. I didn't abandon my children on my family. I went to work and then they came home with me every single night...", "Many many people are left by their partner. Next to none of them leave their children because of this. These kids lost their father and on top of that their mother too. Losing your partner is not an excuse to abandon your kids. She\u2019s not a single mom. She only visits her kids in the weekend. Someone who left their kids isn\u2019t a single mom.", "So she should just not work????", "She has to work. Being a single parent isn\u2019t easy. What she didn\u2019t expect was for her sister to alienate her children from her and break the one boundary she set Church. Church sponsored is still church. OP has every right to remove those kids and any child therapist would not suggest they continue to spend time with BIL and SIL", "If you have a psychology degree, then you must know that children are very impressionable and very easy to coach in their naivity. Especially churches are very good at indoctrination like that.\n\nI'm sorry, but you cannot convince me that the church did not have any religious involvement in this event at all.", "Yep. Towns around here hold annual festivals (or carnivals) to raise funds for the community. It wasn't out of the ordinary to see the nuns from St. Mary's hosting a Friday Night Fish Fry or the Methodists hosting a Sunday morning pancake breakfast right before the bar league softball championships kicked off. \n\nThey made no bones about who was sponsoring it, but they certainly weren't pushing it.", "Sorry, but I disagree. The Christian worldview is that we must constantly be asking for forgiveness for the sin of being human. That freaking children should be given the emotional blackmail that they're responsible for all the evils in the world. It's toxic. And OP has every right to mot let their child be anywhere near that stuff.", "Why can\u2019t she work and after work take care of her kids? That\u2019s what all other single parents do. I assume she\u2019s not working 24/5 right?", "Of course she has to work. Many people work and take care of their kids. And many also do so on their own. OP isn\u2019t the only working single mom. 99,9% don\u2019t abandon their kids.", "I hate it when people call kids impressionable. It completely takes away from how intelligent they are and their ability to think critically at a young age. I\u2019m not saying kids can\u2019t be naive but so can adults. I\u2019ve worked with kids in religious settings and they ask just as many thoughtful questions as an adult would. You can choose not to believe it but as someone who has both attended these events as well as helped organize them I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s true. The fact that this event was open to the public and was not held on church property is evidence of that.", "That\u2019s not true at all. I\u2019m sorry you had a bad experience at the hands of so called Christians but that\u2019s not what Christianity is about. Don\u2019t spread false information about an entire religion just because you encountered people who represented it incorrectly.", "You don't get to go around to strangers on the internet and tell them that their lived experiences are false. Who tf do you think you are?\n\nEdit: For Legal-Ad-1454 it's not letting me post a response so I'm just gonna say it here\n\nI may be curt in my responses. But I never respond with hate. That's you looking in a mirror. I only ever give objective facts or my experiences. I provide sources for the former and good-faith for the latter. That is a lot more than I can say about some of the people who respond to me.", "Read my comment again. I didn\u2019t say your experience was false. I said your assertions about Christianity were false. I even apologized to you for your experience, so you need to calm down. I\u2019ve studied Christianity from an spiritual as well as an academic perspective and what you\u2019re saying about the Christian world view isn\u2019t true. That\u2019s just a fact.", "Your experience in the church isn\u2019t the monolith for all experiences in the church. Just because you had a bad one doesn\u2019t mean that everyone does. No small sample size is representative of the whole. Besides you responding with hate and vitriol when the commenter you\u2019re talking to is trying their best to be kind to such a hateful person makes you look bad. And all this is coming from someone who had bad experiences in a church and no longer goes.", "\u201cAnd when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.\"\n\nhttps://biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm", "The Bible also says to let your light so shine before men that they may see your good work. Essentially Christians are supposed to be public about their faith without being show offs about it. What point are you trying to convey?", "My dad believed this deeply. Unfortunately, the Evangelicals in the family don\u2019t and decided, knowing his beliefs, to spectacle pray over him when he was in a coma. Not the first boundary they have broken. I have zero tolerance for people who overstep spiritual boundaries."]}
