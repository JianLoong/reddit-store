And not nitpick about it . And if life eventually pokes any hole in my logic I will surely update you.", "NTA but not necessarily correct.  It could simply be a difference in cultures.  I think she's completely wrong about cooking behind a woman's job.  Look at the huge number of male chefs.  Cooking is for everybody.  Continue cooking,  but you might try and slow other people to try it.  Not even you cook will be too others taste,  but that's not important.

She is a woman herself and that's just her outlook on what a woman should be. It's rather traditional, but each to their own.\n\nShe has a subjective ideal model of a woman and strives to be that one and suggests you to be that one also, which is far from \"hating\" women.", "NTA, I get what she's saying but to say women HAVE to cook to be women is pretty demeaning. That being said, it's not misogyny. It's not hatred to say cooking is a responsibility feminine women should take charge of, just like it wouldn't be misandry to say security is a responsibility masculine men should take charge of. She just has a different world view from you, perhaps you could call it sexist but definitely not misogynistic imo.\n\nJust a side note, depending on what you mean by you wouldn't cook for your family, that might be a little weird. If you mean at family gatherings, understandable, totally get that. I love cooking for family, but judgement can be harsh. If you mean like your future husband and children, that'd be kinda odd, especially if you're passionate about it. It's so satisfying to see my girlfriend enjoying my cooking. I assume you mean extended family though, in which case yeah.\n\nPS: I'm gonna proactively amend this a little cause I've though of better words. I don't personally think it's sexist to say women should know how to cook, but I also think men should know how to cook. Just like how both single men and single women should have jobs and be able to pay their own bills. Doesn't mean you are less of a man/woman if you don't, but you SHOULD have the ability to (at least be trying). Those are just some basic expectations of adults. It WOULD be sexist to limit someone's ability based on their gender (eg: women can't be engineers or men can't be teachers). Also, misogyny is such an overused term that nobody really even thinks about how they're using it, so I don't blame you for having that gut reaction. While I think you both just have different views on femininity, the way she said it was definitely insensitive.

If she understands why you don't feel comfortable cooking for others she may actually try to help... for example, something that might help would be if she takes a taste and either says it's good or offers well-meaning constructive criticism. \n\nMy brother does the cooking at family get-togethers in our mothers house, but we have a completely different culture, he enjoys cooking and is fantastic at it... We still have stereotypical gender roles but it is not really frowned upon to have a man cooking the meal. It's considered an important life skill in my culture. Where I come from, some families teach their boys how to knit before they're taught how to read and write.\n\nKeep cooking not just because practice makes perfect and you'll make mistakes less often, but because you enjoy it.

I hate it when you cook for others and they either try to \u2018help\u2019 you or alter your recipe or make a face if something is not up to their standard or taste. After multiple small and often funny clashes, my husband and I have this understanding that only one person can be the alpha in the kitchen at a time. So when it\u2019s my recipe, I call the shots and he can choose to help by being an assistant and carry out my instructions, and vice versa. This arrangement works great for us. And we never miss to compliment each other\u2019s cooking afterwards even if the dish may not be perfect as per our standards.

You're doing me a fascinate!", "Yeah, as in \"doing a racism\". It's internet slang.", "I hope it\u2019s David Attenborough", "Carrot and coriander soup sounds horrid.", "I actually just cook Indian food.

It's about outsiders really.\n\nIf you're a brahmin hindu you don't want men or women in your family eating out of cook ware used to prepare meat.

Sadly our hostel didn't have kitchen . And about not sharing if I am cooking for you  for 2 hours,  I would expect a thanks.

(His *Dictionary of Troublesome Words* is also good, though obviously more focused, and explores some concepts more deeply as a result, if that's your jam.) He's also a very engaging author - you don't feel like you've been punching your brain after 30 minutes, or end up nodding off because the text is boring.\n\nIf you're interested in a \"how to write good\" type thing, *On Writing* by Stephen King is honestly one of the best I've read.\n\n(I'm also taking into account the fact you said you're still learning the language (and doing incredibly well, just by the way, going by your comments), and having a perhaps stern teacher.
