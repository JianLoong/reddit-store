It is no more gender specific than any other chore or hobby.\n\nWhat does your roommate think of male chefs and cooks?", "Your roommate is right. If you don't cook for others, your uterus shrivels up. Your ovaries and fallopian tubes disintegrate. It's touch and go with your boobs. Get in the kitchen tout suite!\n\nNTA\n\n Your roommate is a dumbass and should be embarrassed and ashamed of herself. Keep your cooking joy. I'm like you, cooking is a hobby and relaxing. Obligatory cooking is not fun. Also, I can't see myself in a relationship with a man who can't cook even basic dishes (not necessarily gourmet). That, to me, is failure to be an adult.", "NTA, shes an elitist moron, and probably has issues wiping her own arse", "NTA.\n\nShe is, in fact, misogynistic, and also classist.  Which is to say, bigoted.\n\nBut do try to understand that if she was raised being taught this as a cultural norm, at least she comes by it honestly, so to speak.", "Yeah that\u2019s actually just a really sad view of women, especially coming from a woman.\n\nGenuinely a little upsetting that an actual functioning female believes that statement and applies it to herself.", "NTA, but rather than just calling her a misogynist, it might be useful to say things that help her see a different point of view. Like, even just asking questions.\n\n\u201cWhy do you think womanhood is defined by a domestic role?\u201d \u201cIt sounds like you think I shouldn\u2019t let myself be happy unless I am taking care of others, is that true?\u201d \u201chave you ever pictured a life for yourself outside of marriage and family?\u201d \u201cIt sounds like you are trying to make me feel bad about something I feel, why is that?\u201d \n\nIt might help cut down the tension :)", "NTA.

Regardless of gender or cultural beliefs they should be cooking for their own self. NTA.", "you stood up for yourself. Good for you. NTA.", "You are absolutely NTA, good on you for putting your foot down on your roommate's misogynistic views! He (assuming it's a he) will hopefully not make the mistake of assuming the woman should automatically do the cooking because that's her job and role as a woman!", "NTA. What she said was insulting and misogynistic.", "Gendered cultural expectations are definitionally misogynistic/misandrist.\n\nWith that said you should work on your issue with cooking for other people.

She has internalized what she was taught all her life.\n\n\"that is a misogynistic statement\" is different than \"you are a misogynist\" and would have been easier for her to agree with. More likely to change her attitude.\n\nI hope that explains why I'm going with NAH.\n\nIt hard for me to think of your roommate as an asshole rather than as a victim of her culture.", "YTA. It's true. Your husband will demand you cook for him and your children. Cooking brings the family together. Don't get brainwashed by these single, strong, brave and fearless future cat ladies. \n\nLike a man works hard to provide for his family, so should a wife nourish that family with healthy food.", "I know everyone is saying you're NTA (and I agree), but let me explain a bit from her side.\n\nGrowing up as Indians, we are often told these sort of things from our parents and this is the view that our community often have. To just shut down her words and say \"that's misogynistic\" isn't going to help anyone.\n\nObviously on reddit you will usually get the perspective of those born and raised in the west, but try to understand that people can be raised very differently and it doesn't make them bad people.\n\nI'm not attacking you or anything, but just thought I could give you a different perspective :)", "So your position is that you will never cook for your family because it might make you feel sad?   \n\n\nThats just as stupid as a husband who won't cook because its women's work. Get therapy.", "It isn\u2019t misogyny necessarily. But she definitely believes in the way she has been raised\u2026 and it\u2019s bullshit. She might be perfectly happy to fulfill that role.

The problem here is people need to leave each other alone and stop trying to make everyone else live by their rules", "NTA\n\nBut like most people on Reddit, you have no clue what the word misogyny means.\n\nThinking a woman should cook for her family is not misogyny. \n\nIf it is, then thinking a man should provide for his family is misandrist.\n\nYou might call either of them sexist if you wish.", "This is reddit so acknowledging a woman cooking is important to her family is vile and disgusting.", "Misogyny means specifically the hatred of women.  I don\u2019t think what she said means she hates women.  It\u2019s sexist for sure though.

We both work, and do it together. WE keep OUR place clean.", "NTA.  That is indeed misogynist.", "NTA Reducing womanhood to labor and one specific one at that is absolutely mysoginistic and ableist. There's so much aspirations and things women can do. They don't owe it to anyone to do unpaid labor", "A soft asshole maybe. I understand where you're coming from. But in my experience labelling people without actually engaging in a discussion on why they hold that view achieves nothing. Why does your roommate think that? Does she have any experience of women stepping out of that gender role? Share your own perspectives on the matter.

You're not wrong.\n\nWhat your friend said was misogynistic, but calling her a misogynist is putting her in a convenient box of your choosing. It's just as bad as what she did to you.\n\nMohandas K.

This is a misogynistic statement. Interiorized misogyny is common. \n\n(Also, I believe it is appropriate for an Indian person who cares about equity and discrimination to spend some time thinking and learning about the caste system. \"In my caste...\" is not an equivalent turn if phrase to \"in my culture/religion\".

And house help for cooking are only used by 'my caste'. \nI do not want to make it caste issue but she has many times pointed out my caste' therefore  I frustrated impulsively  called her misogynistic.\nFYI , her caste is upper caste and my caste' is lower caste.
