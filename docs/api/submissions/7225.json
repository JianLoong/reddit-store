I can see a long time partner being shocked to hear about this second hand, but teens getting a tattoo without discussing it with, presumably, someone they haven't been dating that long?

If she has worked hard her entire life (I presume to go to an Ivy), why is she such a monster for wanting to be with someone who also has worked similarly as hard?\n\nI went to graduate school quite a ways from where I went to undergrad. If I saw someone on a dating app who claimed they went to school where I went to undergrad there, I'd be incredibly excited and would want to go on a date with them, just so I can connect with someone similar to me. Mind you, my grad school was a lot more prestigious than where I went to undergrad. If I found out that person lied, or took a free course and claimed to go there, I definitely would be more than a little bummed out because the reason I swiped right was on that fact.\n\nHow is her reaction any different from someone who found out they got catfished?\n\nedit: a word", "I mean, you\u2019re going to filter out a ton of interesting, smart, driven, successful people if you only look for Ivy leaguers, but people are entitled to their preferences.", "Sorry. I\u2019ll delete.", "I agree it\u2019s shallow but obviously going to Harvard is a core part of the OPs identity. Some people and their families are like that.\n\nThere is also a dating service that only lets you in if you earn more than $200,000. Lots of niche dating sites I guess.\n\nI googled them so not that familiar.

Her reaction to this displays a lot of insecurity. If your SO has a relationship with someone that is this strong, you have to be ok with it or the relationship will fail from self sabotage. I'd be giving it the side eye, except OP said she was a lesbian.\n\nIf you can't trust that your SO and their best friend aren't behaving properly behind your back then you leave. It doesn't actually matter in this case if there's cheating going on or not. If he's cheating, he's not worth it, and if he's not cheating then you just don't trust him enough and you either need to work on yourself or leave.", "That should go to the best post involving food category", "This PART. \n\nIma a lesbian my bestie is a straight man. Super platonic. We\u2019d totally get matching tattoos like this. We have a matching tattoo right now to honor a friend of ours that passed.

She gets I\u2019ve know him forever we been through so much and the love we have for each other is infinite. \n\nShe probably be happier if we got the tattoo so she didn\u2019t have to listen to us get stoned and plan it out anymore lmaoooo", "But it's not OP's responsibility.

OP and girlfriend are female. OP got matching tattoos with her male best friend.", "Haha omg this is amazing. TY", "He wasn\u2019t a pharmacist, he worked at CVS lolol", "I think she was unfairly judged here.

I don't care about the male friend's situation tbh", "What\u2019s cracking me up is OP\u2019s edit on it: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you meddling kids I could\u2019ve gotten away with my boyfriend never finding this post.

Whew!", "yeah but the difference is that you are a lesbian, op didn't state anywhere that she isn't interested in dudes, so in GF's eyes, this is a straight man and woman with \"you're the light of my life, love forever\" tattoos lol", "If your spouse is an Ivy League alum, your kid can go to that school as a legacy, pretty much regardless of grades.", "OP posted in edit 3 that they\u2019re a lesbian.

I felt like colleges were trying to preserve a sense of family, like, your dad went to the school, and you do too, and this venerable history professor taught your dad, your uncle, your older brother, and you.\n\nBut no. It has racist origins. Given the same level of achievement, it doubles a student's chances of being admitted.

Who knew?", "Being a lesbian is only a good reason for me, on the internet, to not have a problem with it. It doesn't actually matter if the best friend is or not. It's what you can deal with.

You can and should bring it up if you think the bestie is overstepping and why, but if your SO thinks nothing is wrong after you make your case? Leave.", "I also considered it being fake.

If they choose to offer that type of program, then so be it.", "She was excited to meet a Harvard alum. It doesn\u2019t say that she only dates elite grads. He lied to get more dates.", "I think she was really judged unfairly. Dude was clearly inflating his credentials and she caught him in a lie. She\u2019s allowed to not want to date liars.", "She sounds pretty young. She probably didn\u2019t think through the obvious lies.", "Did you read the comment I responded to?", "She approached OP the day before the tattoo though. That sounds to me like she'd been addressing it with the bf repeatedly and he refused to do anything about it. Now it's the day before the tattoo and she's desperate so approached the OP. \n\nHonestly I think Devon's the AH. Either the gf didn't know until the day before that he was getting the tattoo, in which case he's an AH. Or he's known much longer that the gf was really upset about it but not told OP. I don't blame OP for going ahead when it was so close to the appointment and they were blindsided. I don't blame the gf for being upset about the tattoo. \n\nBut Devon definitely could have done something differently. He could have told OP his gf was having an issue with it. They could have had a conversation about it. The gf may have just needed a bit more time to get used to it, who knows.\n\nDevon's the AH.", "Yeah....I find it extremely suspect that OP didn't mention being a lesbian until her third edit after a lot of people were being a bit negative about her relationship with Devon."]}
