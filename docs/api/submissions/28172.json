{"id": 28172, "submission_id": "16z2y5b", "title": "AITAH for declining to visit my boyfriends family?", "selftext": "I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for almost three years. His mom has never approved of me because we had sex before marriage (even though she isn\u2019t religious) and she tried to keep him from dating me originally because of it (we had sex before we dated). She\u2019s the classic crazy obsessive mom, and I know it isn\u2019t personal because she\u2019d probably dislike anyone her son dates. She thinks he\u2019s perfect and that I\u2019m a distraction from him achieving his career goals. She has only met me and had an actual conversation with me one time, and tried to avoid me after that. She met my parents and was incredibly rude to them and to me, and she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn\u2019t like me or approve of the relationship. \nMy boyfriend has set boundaries with her and the situation has improved a lot since we\u2019ve started dating, but there\u2019s one thing she still does that makes me furious. Anytime he gets off a call with her, she\u2019ll make a comment about how she \u201chopes he doesn\u2019t get me pregnant\u201d and several comments similar. \nIf it were a passing comment once or twice, I would just get over it. But it has happened probably a dozen times now over the course of a year and a half. I don\u2019t care what her intention is with the comment, I find it disrespectful and reductive to my role in my boyfriends life, as if I\u2019m just some slut he sleeps with and not his serious girlfriend, and god forbid I get pregnant and trap her perfect son. \nMy boyfriend and I are pretty serious, and he has visited my family multiple times now. I\u2019m sure she feels awkward about the fact that my family makes an effort to get to know him and she won\u2019t make the same effort with me, so they\u2019ve now invited me to visit them (both of our families in a different state from where we are currently living). I get that if we end up getting married that I\u2019ll have to deal with her, but she made YET ANOTHER comment about me getting pregnant in the same conversation about having me visit them. AITAH for wanting to decline?\n\nEdit: BF doesn\u2019t talk to mom about sex at all, she only assumes we have because I used to sleep at his place in college and she used to track his phone. The tracking has now stopped because of a conversation he had about boundaries with her. She still makes these comments unsolicited, and he has hung up the phone multiple times in these scenarios. He understands how bad it is.", "created_utc": 1696365929, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16z2y5b/aitah_for_declining_to_visit_my_boyfriends_family/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm of the very strong opinion that one should absolutely under no circumstances ever tolerate emotional and verbal abuse from your partner's family. I would think very seriously about whether or not you can see a future with this person if they're not willing to outright tell their mom to stop with the constant negative comments about you or else they are cutting off contact entirely.", "NTA.\nIt\u2019s okay to decline an invitation to spend time with someone who has only treated you poorly. \nIt\u2019s also time for your BF to set a firm boundary on his mother making insulting comments about you like that. Your sex life is none of her business.", "NTA, but if BF isn't ready to drastically reduce contact this could be a good attempt to make nice for your future sanity.  Could also pose it to BF as thus being her last chance to act like a decent person before getting cut off.  Easy to say not in the situation, but just some food for thought.\n\nInfo: What is BF's take on this?  That is ultimately the more concerning question.", "Why don\u2019t you *ask* him if he wants you to see his hometown?\n\nBut if you go? There is no way in hell I would be sleeping under that woman\u2019s roof. It\u2019s a motel,  (or some such)-or nothing, so if she gets too obnoxious, you can absolutely leave. \n\nHave your credit cards and cash and ID on your person at all times. MIL can\u2019t go through your purse if you don\u2019t have one, and you can stand up and leave without delay. I find that having a real emergency exit strategy makes me feel better and less trapped in stressful situations. \n\nNTA for not wanting to go. And maybe go over to justnomil", "NTA. Next time you hear his mother make a comment about pregnancy, shout into the phone: \"Don't worry - we use condoms when we have sex!\" (Or other form of BC.) Really make her embarrassed to be bringing up such archaic beliefs in 2023. Sheesh.", "NTA your boyfriend needs to stop talking about sex with his mom! He should be the one who is refusing to visit because of those comments. \n\nYou shouldn't even be hearing that she says those things, unless you're asking. He really doesn't need to pass on \"my mom says she hopes you don't get pregnant\" it should be more like \"my mom was creeping me out so I told her I wouldn't call until next month and reminded her why\" or something. \n\nHe needs to make some serious realizations before he can be a good partner, but the fact that you feel like you need to convince him of Anything in this situation means he's got a lot of inward work to do, in my opinion. It's just not ok for this to be a pattern.", "NTA.\n\nAnd even if he \"got you pregnant\" (I cringe a bit because in my Universe it takes two to tango)? What then? Would she want you to get married? Would she want you to get an abortion although that would be a deadly sin? (A sin just to you, because perfect BabyBoy would have been trapped, I guess.) If you were pregnant and decided to give birth, would she decline to be a Grandma and be out of your life? Really? Or would she try to take over? (I suspect the latter.)\n\nBut that being said, your sexual life should not be a topic of conversation with her. If she tries again, you might ask her the same questions: Are you using protection? You know, genetic disorders are more likely to happen with elderly parents, so you might want to preserve that. Should we talk about methods of birth control? I prefer the IUD, because the pills can have an impact on your health because...\n\nOh, and, yes, I would not go. If you don't feel like going, don't. You already know you won't have a good time there. And you would have to sleep in different rooms, because premarital sex is a no go.", "NTA. You have boundaries and they are completely valid. She seems overbearing and crazy. And I hope your boyfriend can shake her off at some point and set boundaries too", " NTA.

And then it happens again, but then he keeps talking to her. It hasn't stopped happening at all, but now this invitation is on the table and being considered? \n\nYou're right to smell danger and run, but he is just going to be a good son no matter what, despite disrespect.\n\nIt's good that he didn't directly tell her you had sex, but that still paints a sad picture. Either he swears he didn't have sex and she doesn't believe him, or he didn't answer and she decided that means it happened and won't respect his privacy. It's sexual harassment for her to keep bringing this up in this context. But he's going to visit her and it's your choice what you do. He needs an intervention. \n\nYou need to try to help him see how unhealthy that relationship is. Maybe you can find a reputable website that has a checklist of inappropriate comments for moms to make to their sons and have him see how many he checks off. There is so much third party information about moms obsessed with their sons sex lives that you would just have to find a good source that he would trust and present it to him."]}
