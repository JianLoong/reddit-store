My dad wanted his stuffed animal collection to go to us and requested that my uncle store them for us until we were both old enough to take some from them. The collection is extensive and he started getting them as a baby and into his early 20s when he travelled a lot and picked up different stuffed animals across the globe. My uncle still has them stored at his house.\n\nMom decided recently that she wanted my half brother to have one of the stuffed animals. She thought it would be a nice gesture and a show that he was being accepted fully by my brother and I. Plus he's a kid who loves stuffed animals and is starting his own collection.\n\nMom asked my brother about it and he told her he was not okay with that. She pushed the issue until he said our half brother was not dad's son and that he didn't even consider him a true sibling and he'd never give our uncle (or our other aunts and uncles) the okay to give one for him. Mom went through my uncle who kept the collection and then my other aunts and uncles who are also dad's siblings but do not have them. Each of them said no and told her that my half brother had nothing to do with them or my dad and he was not deserving of something from the collection.\n\nMom came to me last and told me how sweet it would be and how it would be a loving story to tell my half brother one day, that I wanted him to have something so sentimental to me and was willing to share part of my dad with him. I told her I felt the same as my brother and aunts and uncles and I would never get my half brother one from the collection. \n\nShe argued that there are so many of them and one of them would not be missed by us but the meaning behind it would mean the world to my half brother.\n\nI told her I did not care. I have dug my heels in.\n\nMy mom is really angry about it and so is her husband, who said we were all hateful and that his son deserves better than the rejection.

I don\u2019t understand the trend of  expecting people to give away possessions that belonged to their loved ones. Why should a toddler who never met, and is not related to your Dad have something of his? It\u2019s a bizarre request imo. Stick to your guns and make sure your uncle knows how you feel as well. These are your possessions and it was so rude of your mom to try to go through your uncle in the first place.", "NTA - The way your mom is jumping from person to person to ask, then tried to guilt you as a last resort was extremely manipulative on her part. \n\nYour half brother has absolutely no right to anything of your fathers and never will. He never even knew your dad while he was alive. It's weird and disrespectful and I don't even understand why your mom thinks this is even close to being okay.\n\nYour brother is rude for stating he doesn't consider your half sibling as a \"real\" sibling too, however. Your half sibling has done nothing wrong here and doesn't deserve that sort of treatment.", "Not the asshole! The half-brother has no relation with your dad. Your mum should buy her son his own stuffed toy", "NTA. A 2yo kid doesn\u2019t really care what toy he gets, it the adults pushing their agenda. Your mom and her husband are the AHs.", "NTA.  Your mom worked her way down the line to see if she could get *someone* to say \"yes\".  It's kind of telling that you are *the last* person she asked.\n\nThose are memories of your father.  A two-year-old will probably destroy one and then your mother would demand that you replace it with another one from the collection.  It would be a never-ending cycle.", "NTA but your mom sure is. She managed to trample the legacy your father left and make her two year old's life harder in one magic act. Don't blame the kid - he doesn't know. But mom. Wowee", "NTA\n\n I'm so sick of parents who think their (dead) ex's family owes something to their new kids.\n\nP.s. ignore the righteous people who would come at you with the \" your brother is a child so you should do everything possible to make him happy and he is a real brother to you\".", "Nta your mom has no right to ask, your brother doesn\u2019t even know it exists and even if he did one day hear about it and ask you have no obligation to give him something **your dad wanted for his children** your half sibling is not your fathers child, it\u2019s as simple as that.", "This is such a strange request. Are these stuffed animals worth money?\n\nOut of curiosity - when do you & your brother plan on taking these back? Seems strange that they are all still sitting in boxes & someone\u2019s attic/basement. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour half brother has a living father, there is no reason for him to need a stuffed animal from a dead man he doesn\u2019t know. Your mother and her husband are being emotionally abusive by trying to guilt you and your brother int giving a stuffed animal to a child who will destroy it because he\u2019s a baby. Don\u2019t give in, these people are toxic. If you can go no contact I would suggest blocking them until they learn to behave.", "NTA. Why would your mom think that making you give away your things, especially holding sentimental value, will make you like your half-brother? This kid has nothing to do with your father and his collection. He needs toys? His parents should buy them. And no, the 2yo won't care about any \"meaning behind the gesture\", not now and most likely not ever, it's all in your mom's head.", "NTA - Your father wanted you boys to have his collection when you were old enough to enjoy.  Nice gesture or not, you half sibling has absolutely nothing to do with your father or his stuffed animal collection.  You mom and step dad being angry at you is beyond the pale.  They have no reason to be.  Tell them to go FO and go NC with them all as soon as you can as they will be trying to run your lives forever.", "NTA- Your mother has been told by multiple people that her request is inappropriate. At this point, she is asking because her husband\u2019s feelings are hurt. You aren\u2019t required to give away what is basically your inheritance. Your half brother has two living parents with no biological relation to your father.", "NTA\n\nYour half-brother has no right to anything of your father's.\n\nBuy him a brand-new stuffie for his birthday instead, and he can add that to his collection.", "NTA. Sigh. Just another case of remarried parents trying to force a sense of family on step siblings. But this is a particularly bizarre example.  You and your brother are adults, and are not living with your mom's family. You have an inheritance from your dad that is largely sentimental. Your mom for some reason has decided that you should share it with her son by another father. And she is making it a hill to die on. Which is hardly a way to encourage the actual bonding between her children that is almost certainly her actual goal. She is being ridiculous. Stick to your guns.", "NTA I feel for your half brother, but he has no familial or emotional ties to your dad. Your father left your family those stuffed animals.", "NTA your mother can buy stuffed animal to give her step son herself.", "If I understand you correctly, you and your brother haven't yet chosen from the collection anyway. Until those selections are made, you do not own any individual pieces within the collection, only the promise of them. Therefore, you have no right to gift your 2yo brother any part of the collection *even if you wished to*. \n\nAnd as for your mom's argument as to why you should gift this your brother? She claims that your two year old half brother would understand the meaning behind a gift from your father's collection? No. He's two. He'd understand it is a toy, and a gift, but he would not be able to understand at two the sentimental value of that gift. \n\nEither due to their financial value, or their sentimental value to your father, your dad deliberately chose to entrust the collection to your uncle until you and your brother were ready to chose from them. I do wonder why your dad did that. Maybe he was concerned that his collection would get damaged by little children who weren't yet able to appreciate them, and thought if they were in your own home this might happen. Maybe he was concerned they'd be sold or gifted away. It isn't clear if you know the reason your uncle was entrusted with the collection, but given the current demands and verbal abuse, it sounds like it was a good thing he was entrusted them.\n\nSo for refusing to offer your half-brother one of your father's collection, NTA. \n\nBut your little half-brother hasn't done anything wrong either. Have you ever given him a stuffed animal? I'm not meaning from your father's collection, but something that you buy yourself for him as a gift, or another toy which was part of your childhood which you are happy to pass on.", "INFO: Why don't you and your brother buy/make a new stuffed bear for your half-sibling? Gift it to him with a card that says, \"we couldn't gift you a bear from our late Dad's collection, because we have different Dad's. You are lucky enough to have your Dad here with you today and everyday. Treasure that. Here's a bear from your big brothers who love you very much\". \n\nThat should stop your Mum's complaints.", "NAH. \n\nLet me explain, I lost my mother over 10 years ago at age 25 and it was devastation. I can't imagine what it would be like to lose her at the age you lost your father. I was old enough to see what it did to my father to lose his wife, the person he was planning to spend his entire life with and that was taken away from him. It destroyed him, my siblings and I could only do so much and it did help, but he was lost until he found someone else and now shares a life with another person. This does not mean he loves my mother less, or didn't love her at all, and his new wife makes him happy and gives him purpose again. \n\nI imagine your mother possibly has a similar experience, she still loves your father and that is not diminished with your new step father or half brother. The other thing I noticed is my siblings reachtions to my father dating. My siblings, who are all older than me and adults, did not like this woman or more specifically that my father would date. They gave her no chance to meet and be a part of the family and even after a few years my eldest sister and brother are basically no contact with him, and my other sister is low contact and she blames her for that. \n\nI give you this context as I wanted to try to imagine how your mother potentially feels in this situation. She married a man that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with and even though he was taken from her she still loves him. She probably has this idea in her head and has convinced herself of it that if this stuffed animal from your father's collection was given to her new son that he accepts her new life. She may even feel guilt about getting a new partner and that this stuffed animal could help alleviate this guilt. \n\nI hope you read through this, I'm not trying to guilt you into providing one of these stuffed animals to your half brother, only trying to give you insight into why your mother feels so strongly on this subject and reacting poorly to you and your brother for denying it, which I want to reiterate is absolutely your right and you should not feel guilt for denying this request, or feel pressured to do so. My mother left me a ring and I couldn't imagine how I would react if someone wanted me to share it with someone else.", "I would\u2019ve bought something new and told the little brother it was from you and your older brother. I\u2019d also check to see if your dad stored money in some plushies.", "You and your brother could gift a stuffed animal that you get from a store lol then everybody wins lol now I'm the Ahole", "It\u2019s\u2026 one stuffed animal. Both my parents are dead. I get that. But it\u2019s ONE little thing. He\u2019s a little dude. Grow up.", "It's a stuffed animal, give him one please. Life is too short to continue this stupid row. It's not a kidney....this world is going to hell over stupid things.", "I think it\u2019s really telling that your dad asked his brother to hold onto the collection for you instead of your mother. He knew something like this was likely.", "NAH.\n\nLook, it doesn't really make sense that your half brother needs any of these particular stuffed animals. He doesn't have any relation to your father, there's no emotional connection to him, and if you're the owner of them it's up to you what happens to them. Your mom shouldn't be harping on this and getting other aunts and uncles involved. She can buy new ones.\n\nOn the other hand, they're stuffed animals that are apparently locked away in storage for over a decade at this point, and there doesn't seem to be any future plans on getting them out of storage. What is anyone doing with them? I'd feel differently if you currently slept with them and had throughout your childhood or had them in your room in a memory chest or something. But they're with a different relative and maybe not even being stored properly.\n\nI just don't see what's the point of claiming ownership over something you don't even possess. Assuming you and your brother are going off to college probably means dorms or small apartments away from home that you're not going to lug teddy bears to. Then a lot of people move around, when they're finding their adult work, live with roommates, rent rooms, have small apartments, etc. When are you going to take them, and what happens with them then? Are they just going to sit in boxes again, because not many young guys decorate their homes with stuffed animals.\n\nI'm just saying, I don't really see what good it's doing or what memories you're preserving of a bunch of stuffies you haven't seen in years, when you could pass down *one or two* to a kid and enjoy seeing him love something that your dad loved too. That makes more sense to me than keeping every single one locked away and maybe opening them after 20 years and seeing a bunch of musty and moth eaten toys that you probably don't even remember at that point.", ">My mom is really angry about it and so is her husband, who said we were all hateful and that his son deserves better than the rejection. He knows what my brother said and what my aunts and uncles said and it pisses him off.\n\nYTA. I don't really blame them. I think for all of you to say no is very immature.\n\nI think your mother may have erred tactically in just \\*how\\* she sought the gesture of inclusiveness by choosing your late father's stuffed animal collection. But\n\n\"he didn't even consider him a true sibling\" from your brother is cruel.\n\n\"Each of them said no and told her that my half brother had nothing to do with them or my dad and he was not deserving of something from the collection\" is jealousy or greedy at best.\n\nAnd I think the same way about your response.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And eventually those people died and by that time, most of their stuff just got sold at yard sales or tossed because of lack of interest and things being stored improperly. There's only so much room to hoard this kind of stuff when people could be enjoying it now. \n\nThey're your toys and you can do what you want with them if you ever get them back from your uncle.

I'd agree with the other suggestions that you could buy something for him with your brother for not a lot of money and it would mean more to him.

She is an artist and I have kept every artwork she\u2019s given to me no matter how it looked. I am so proud of it.
