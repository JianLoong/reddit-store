My dad wanted his stuffed animal collection to go to us and requested that my uncle store them for us until we were both old enough to take some from them. The collection is extensive and he started getting them as a baby and into his early 20s when he travelled a lot and picked up different stuffed animals across the globe. My uncle still has them stored at his house.\n\nMom decided recently that she wanted my half brother to have one of the stuffed animals. She thought it would be a nice gesture and a show that he was being accepted fully by my brother and I. Plus he's a kid who loves stuffed animals and is starting his own collection.\n\nMom asked my brother about it and he told her he was not okay with that. She pushed the issue until he said our half brother was not dad's son and that he didn't even consider him a true sibling and he'd never give our uncle (or our other aunts and uncles) the okay to give one for him. Mom went through my uncle who kept the collection and then my other aunts and uncles who are also dad's siblings but do not have them. Each of them said no and told her that my half brother had nothing to do with them or my dad and he was not deserving of something from the collection.\n\nMom came to me last and told me how sweet it would be and how it would be a loving story to tell my half brother one day, that I wanted him to have something so sentimental to me and was willing to share part of my dad with him. I told her I felt the same as my brother and aunts and uncles and I would never get my half brother one from the collection. \n\nShe argued that there are so many of them and one of them would not be missed by us but the meaning behind it would mean the world to my half brother.\n\nI told her I did not care. I have dug my heels in.\n\nMy mom is really angry about it and so is her husband, who said we were all hateful and that his son deserves better than the rejection. He knows what my brother said and what my aunts and uncles said and it pisses him off.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692530987, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15w8zl5/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_half_brother_have_a/", "score": 981, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t understand the trend of  expecting people to give away possessions that belonged to their loved ones. Why should a toddler who never met, and is not related to your Dad have something of his? It\u2019s a bizarre request imo. Stick to your guns and make sure your uncle knows how you feel as well. These are your possessions and it was so rude of your mom to try to go through your uncle in the first place.", "NTA - The way your mom is jumping from person to person to ask, then tried to guilt you as a last resort was extremely manipulative on her part. \n\nYour half brother has absolutely no right to anything of your fathers and never will. He never even knew your dad while he was alive. It's weird and disrespectful and I don't even understand why your mom thinks this is even close to being okay.\n\nYour brother is rude for stating he doesn't consider your half sibling as a \"real\" sibling too, however. Your half sibling has done nothing wrong here and doesn't deserve that sort of treatment.", "Not the asshole! The half-brother has no relation with your dad.

Your mom worked her way down the line to see if she could get *someone* to say \"yes\".  It's kind of telling that you are *the last* person she asked.\n\nThose are memories of your father.  A two-year-old will probably destroy one and then your mother would demand that you replace it with another one from the collection.  It would be a never-ending cycle.", "NTA but your mom sure is. She managed to trample the legacy your father left and make her two year old's life harder in one magic act. Don't blame the kid - he doesn't know. But mom. Wowee", "NTA\n\n I'm so sick of parents who think their (dead) ex's family owes something to their new kids.\n\nP.s. ignore the righteous people who would come at you with the \" your brother is a child so you should do everything possible to make him happy and he is a real brother to you\".", "Nta your mom has no right to ask, your brother doesn\u2019t even know it exists and even if he did one day hear about it and ask you have no obligation to give him something **your dad wanted for his children** your half sibling is not your fathers child, it\u2019s as simple as that.", "This is such a strange request.

Your mother and her husband are being emotionally abusive by trying to guilt you and your brother int giving a stuffed animal to a child who will destroy it because he\u2019s a baby. Don\u2019t give in, these people are toxic. If you can go no contact I would suggest blocking them until they learn to behave.", "NTA. Why would your mom think that making you give away your things, especially holding sentimental value, will make you like your half-brother? This kid has nothing to do with your father and his collection. He needs toys? His parents should buy them. And no, the 2yo won't care about any \"meaning behind the gesture\", not now and most likely not ever, it's all in your mom's head.", "NTA - Your father wanted you boys to have his collection when you were old enough to enjoy.  Nice gesture or not, you half sibling has absolutely nothing to do with your father or his stuffed animal collection.  You mom and step dad being angry at you is beyond the pale.  They have no reason to be.  Tell them to go FO and go NC with them all as soon as you can as they will be trying to run your lives forever.", "NTA- Your mother has been told by multiple people that her request is inappropriate. At this point, she is asking because her husband\u2019s feelings are hurt. You aren\u2019t required to give away what is basically your inheritance. Your half brother has two living parents with no biological relation to your father.", "NTA\n\nYour half-brother has no right to anything of your father's.\n\nBuy him a brand-new stuffie for his birthday instead, and he can add that to his collection.", "NTA. Sigh. Just another case of remarried parents trying to force a sense of family on step siblings. But this is a particularly bizarre example.  You and your brother are adults, and are not living with your mom's family. You have an inheritance from your dad that is largely sentimental. Your mom for some reason has decided that you should share it with her son by another father. And she is making it a hill to die on. Which is hardly a way to encourage the actual bonding between her children that is almost certainly her actual goal. She is being ridiculous. Stick to your guns.", "NTA I feel for your half brother, but he has no familial or emotional ties to your dad. Your father left your family those stuffed animals.", "NTA your mother can buy stuffed animal to give her step son herself.", "If I understand you correctly, you and your brother haven't yet chosen from the collection anyway. Until those selections are made, you do not own any individual pieces within the collection, only the promise of them. Therefore, you have no right to gift your 2yo brother any part of the collection *even if you wished to*. \n\nAnd as for your mom's argument as to why you should gift this your brother? She claims that your two year old half brother would understand the meaning behind a gift from your father's collection? No. He's two. He'd understand it is a toy, and a gift, but he would not be able to understand at two the sentimental value of that gift. \n\nEither due to their financial value, or their sentimental value to your father, your dad deliberately chose to entrust the collection to your uncle until you and your brother were ready to chose from them. I do wonder why your dad did that. Maybe he was concerned that his collection would get damaged by little children who weren't yet able to appreciate them, and thought if they were in your own home this might happen. Maybe he was concerned they'd be sold or gifted away. It isn't clear if you know the reason your uncle was entrusted with the collection, but given the current demands and verbal abuse, it sounds like it was a good thing he was entrusted them.\n\nSo for refusing to offer your half-brother one of your father's collection, NTA. \n\nBut your little half-brother hasn't done anything wrong either. Have you ever given him a stuffed animal? I'm not meaning from your father's collection, but something that you buy yourself for him as a gift, or another toy which was part of your childhood which you are happy to pass on.", "INFO: Why don't you and your brother buy/make a new stuffed bear for your half-sibling? Gift it to him with a card that says, \"we couldn't gift you a bear from our late Dad's collection, because we have different Dad's. You are lucky enough to have your Dad here with you today and everyday. Treasure that. Here's a bear from your big brothers who love you very much\". \n\nThat should stop your Mum's complaints.\n\nEdit: for people who don't get it, the parents will open the card and read it. The card is for them. It makes it a lot harder for Mum to carry on her \"my child from my 2nd husband deserves items from my late husband\" campaign when they've been gifted a new teddy from the late husband's kids with the explicit reminder on it that her kid from her 2nd marriage has 2 living parents while they don't. Especially if they make gifting little brother new teddies a bday tradition and every year sign it \"treasure your Dad before he dies, your brothers love you\". Kill them with kindness tactically by removing the wind from her sail.", "NAH. \n\nLet me explain, I lost my mother over 10 years ago at age 25 and it was devastation. I can't imagine what it would be like to lose her at the age you lost your father. I was old enough to see what it did to my father to lose his wife, the person he was planning to spend his entire life with and that was taken away from him. It destroyed him, my siblings and I could only do so much and it did help, but he was lost until he found someone else and now shares a life with another person. This does not mean he loves my mother less, or didn't love her at all, and his new wife makes him happy and gives him purpose again. \n\nI imagine your mother possibly has a similar experience, she still loves your father and that is not diminished with your new step father or half brother. The other thing I noticed is my siblings reachtions to my father dating. My siblings, who are all older than me and adults, did not like this woman or more specifically that my father would date. They gave her no chance to meet and be a part of the family and even after a few years my eldest sister and brother are basically no contact with him, and my other sister is low contact and she blames her for that. \n\nI give you this context as I wanted to try to imagine how your mother potentially feels in this situation. She married a man that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with and even though he was taken from her she still loves him. She probably has this idea in her head and has convinced herself of it that if this stuffed animal from your father's collection was given to her new son that he accepts her new life. She may even feel guilt about getting a new partner and that this stuffed animal could help alleviate this guilt. \n\nI hope you read through this, I'm not trying to guilt you into providing one of these stuffed animals to your half brother, only trying to give you insight into why your mother feels so strongly on this subject and reacting poorly to you and your brother for denying it, which I want to reiterate is absolutely your right and you should not feel guilt for denying this request, or feel pressured to do so. My mother left me a ring and I couldn't imagine how I would react if someone wanted me to share it with someone else.", "I would\u2019ve bought something new and told the little brother it was from you and your older brother. I\u2019d also check to see if your dad stored money in some plushies.", "You and your brother could gift a stuffed animal that you get from a store lol then everybody wins lol now I'm the Ahole", "It\u2019s\u2026 one stuffed animal. Both my parents are dead. I get that. But it\u2019s ONE little thing. He\u2019s a little dude. Grow up.", "It's a stuffed animal, give him one please. Life is too short to continue this stupid row. It's not a kidney....this world is going to hell over stupid things.", "I think it\u2019s really telling that your dad asked his brother to hold onto the collection for you instead of your mother. He knew something like this was likely.", "NAH.\n\nLook, it doesn't really make sense that your half brother needs any of these particular stuffed animals. He doesn't have any relation to your father, there's no emotional connection to him, and if you're the owner of them it's up to you what happens to them. Your mom shouldn't be harping on this and getting other aunts and uncles involved. She can buy new ones.\n\nOn the other hand, they're stuffed animals that are apparently locked away in storage for over a decade at this point, and there doesn't seem to be any future plans on getting them out of storage. What is anyone doing with them? I'd feel differently if you currently slept with them and had throughout your childhood or had them in your room in a memory chest or something. But they're with a different relative and maybe not even being stored properly.\n\nI just don't see what's the point of claiming ownership over something you don't even possess. Assuming you and your brother are going off to college probably means dorms or small apartments away from home that you're not going to lug teddy bears to. Then a lot of people move around, when they're finding their adult work, live with roommates, rent rooms, have small apartments, etc. When are you going to take them, and what happens with them then? Are they just going to sit in boxes again, because not many young guys decorate their homes with stuffed animals.\n\nI'm just saying, I don't really see what good it's doing or what memories you're preserving of a bunch of stuffies you haven't seen in years, when you could pass down *one or two* to a kid and enjoy seeing him love something that your dad loved too. That makes more sense to me than keeping every single one locked away and maybe opening them after 20 years and seeing a bunch of musty and moth eaten toys that you probably don't even remember at that point.", ">My mom is really angry about it and so is her husband, who said we were all hateful and that his son deserves better than the rejection. He knows what my brother said and what my aunts and uncles said and it pisses him off.\n\nYTA. I don't really blame them. I think for all of you to say no is very immature.\n\nI think your mother may have erred tactically in just \\*how\\* she sought the gesture of inclusiveness by choosing your late father's stuffed animal collection. But\n\n\"he didn't even consider him a true sibling\" from your brother is cruel.\n\n\"Each of them said no and told her that my half brother had nothing to do with them or my dad and he was not deserving of something from the collection\" is jealousy or greedy at best.\n\nAnd I think the same way about your response.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Take your brother to Build A Bear and get a custom toy made. Problem solved.", "NTA -At two years old I guarantee your half brother has no inkling of this mess. This is solely your mother\u2019s attempts to push a scenario of a happy, blended family.\n\nThe collection belongs to you & your brother-y\u2019all have the final say!", "NTA- the fact that they are mad they can't have another MAN's stuffed animal makes no sense are they expensive? worth alot of money? plus that baby is two he could get a stuffed animal from a carnival and be happy he doesn't know your father so there wouldn't be any loving story behind him having one or that having anything to do with him being rejected. Your mother and her husband seem to have some ulterior motives for wanting one. Dont give them anything.", "NTA. Your half brother has nothing to do with your dad so no reason he should have one", "NTA\n\nIt would be a lovely thing to help him to develop his own stuffed animal collection, if he loves them, but not at the expense of yours.", "NTA\n\nWhile I agree that this would be a nice gesture IF and only if you and your brother wanted to do it, you don\u2019t do that should be the end of it. A sentimental item to you and your brother will at least for a few more years will just be another toy to your half brother. By the time he\u2019s old enough to appreciate it there\u2019s a good chance that he will have ruined an old toy through toddler rough play. \n\nYour mother went through every possible person to try and force a nice memory for her new kid.", "NTA. But I do wonder why you and your older brother dislike your baby brother so much. What could he have done at two years old?!", "NTA but I think it would be a nice gesture for you and your brother to buy your half brother a stuffed toy. It would be more special coming directly from you.", "Why does it have to be from your dad\u2019s collection? Are they valuable, and maybe she wants an excuse to get her hands on one for the money? Why can\u2019t it be literally ANY other stuffed animal? NTA. She\u2019s being really weird about this, and I would be suspicious.", "I don't understand why this is the hill your mom and her new husband want to die on because they are so very far in the wrong.  Those animals were left to you by your deceased father and have special meaning to you.  To your two year old brother, however, they will just be stuffed animals and any stuffed animal would serve the same purpose.\n\nSo this isn't about doing something sweet for your little brother, this is about your mother trying to force you and your brother to have less feeling about mementos of your late father and to give up those feelings by handing over things your dad wanted you to have to your step-father's child.\n\nThis is so crass, and so insensitive, it's kind of heart-breaking.  I'm so sorry you're experiencing this very unkind,, inappropriate pressure.  You don't have to succumb.  \n\nI'm wondering, if things stay really crazy at your house with your step-father insisting that it's hateful for you not to give his child your dad's stuffed animal (which is, in fact, hateful of your step-father to say, and completely irrational), could you stay with your uncle for a bit until things cool down?  Your house doesn't sound like a very loving, supportive environment for you right now.\n\nNTA.  Not one little tiny bit.", "INFO: You don\u2019t have to give into your mom\u2019s request, but I don\u2019t really understand your reasons for not wanting to share. Is there some resentment toward your mom or half brother? And if so, what\u2019s the backstory?", "NTA", "Nta", "Everyone Sucks.\nYou aren\u2019t the asshole for reaffirming that you want to keep your dad\u2019s stuffed animal collection, ultimately your half brother wasn\u2019t his child and your mom is in the wrong for pushing on it.\nBUT you are the asshole for alienating your half brother and treating him like he isn\u2019t family because ultimately he is and he is just a two year old who had no part in this. You can establish boundaries without acting like he isn\u2019t your \u201ctrue sibling\u201d.", "It was rude of her to forcefully go through everyone she could including her daughter. Even if the daughter said sure the rest of the family would've prevented it so the sonisnt getting it regardless yet she's forcefully trying to make it happen. My question is what does she TRULY intend on using the toy for? The father is dead and has no relation to the stepson, especially with his own father being in the picture. So if this was a way of \"having stepson acknowledge by OP dad side as their own\" doesn't tht mean he would have access to things OP and OP brother have from tht side of the family? (Ex: if they ever made a college fund for them as they are their family)", "Sounds like mom is the cause of the resentment.", "This might genuinely be the case, especially if the dad didn't trust her to distribute his wealth equally to his kids.", "Ikea sells great stuffed animals. I gave my nephew a tiger when he was two, and he played with it all Christmas. He didn't care where it came from, he just loved it and wouldn't put it down. Best Christmas ever! \n\nIt wouldn't have been a more special toy if it would have been from his great grandmother, not to him at that age. He didn't even really understand presents then. He just knew the tiger was his and he loved it. (And later the snake, the orangutan, and the rest of the jungle collection!)", ">Mom obviously remarried without OP or near-age brother's approval.\n\nchildren do not get to dictate the romantic and sexual lives of their parents wtf is this comment", "No, but they do get to decide what kind of relationship they have with their new family.\n\nThey're under no obligation to care for someone who they (rightly) see as a replacement for their dearly departed father."]}
