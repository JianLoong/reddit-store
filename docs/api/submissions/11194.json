My mom lost full custody of me when I turned 3 and she wasn\u2019t granted visitation, so I grew up with my ex stepmom L (45f). L was always really good to me and always helped me when I was in trouble. About six years ago, L had a baby with my dad, which resulted in my half sister M. About two months after M was born, L developed ppd and also discovered my dad cheating with his coworker G, who is now my new stepmom. L had a mental breakdown and left the country with my half sister. She returned home a week later. My dad took her to court for full custody. L would have been granted 50/50 custody if the courts hadn\u2019t discovered a huge burn on M\u2019s arm which caused L to only be granted weekly visitation (she also lost due to financial reasons and mental health issues), as my dad used this to his advantage. Not even a week after the case was settled, G moved in and began \u201crunning\u201d the house. G has never liked me and has openly told me my skin is too dark and men don\u2019t want to marry women with dark skin like mine. This really affected my self-esteem and caused me to really hate myself. G immediately took over the role of M\u2019s \u201cnew mom\u201d and began spoiling her, which brings us to a week ago. \n\nM had started calling G mommy and L \u201cdaddy's friend\u201d, which has really affected L. We had a small family get together for M\u2019s 6th birthday when G asked M in front of everyone if G could adopt her and be her real mom. M cried in tears of happiness and my dad gave them a big hug and they all cried in tears of joy, I was excluded. The next day my dad, G and I dropped M off to L for a few hours, when G let M go to L she purposely yelled \u201cmommy can\u2019t wait to adopt you\u201d this is where everything goes to shit, L asked my dad what she meant and my dad said that G will legally be adopting M as her real mom, as I was in the car I could hear L scream at G and my dad. L and her mom both screamed at them and told them theirs.\n\n That night, G\u2019s mom T (60f) came over for dinner and my dad explained what happened earlier that day. My G and my dad both joked about how she was \u201ccrazy\u201d and how their plan worked. I asked what plan and my dad told me how they planned for full custody of M and raised her as their own, as G couldn\u2019t have children. This is where I might be the AH. I called them insane and truly horrible people. G said a (not so nice word) and wouldn\u2019t understand and I lost my shit at her. I started screaming at her. My dad sent me to my room where M stood in the hallway and said \u201cdon\u2019t scream at mommy\u201d. I called her a dumb brat and said she\u2019ll never be my sister and then pushed past her. A few minutes later, I heard her crying in her room and my dad came in screaming at me, telling me I was grounded and needed to apologise to G and M. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve calmed down and processed the situation, I feel as if I might be the asshole for yelling at my stepmom, dad, and my half sister.\n\n\nEDIT: don\u2019t ask me any questions about my mom as I don\u2019t like talking about her.", "created_utc": 1677664844, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ezwk4/aita_for_telling_my_stepmom_and_dad_that_they_are/", "score": 578, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can G really adopt your half sister without her mother's  permission?", "NTA. Your dad and stepmom are horrible people. Your stepmom is racist, your dad not only tolerated that but manipulated the situation with his ex wife to get an adoption he wanted to happen. I\u2019m so sorry this has happened to you. I know you have to suck it up\nUntil your 18, but I\u2019d tell L what\u2019s going on first of all. Secondly I\u2019d call CPS a and report the racism and the manipulation so that G can\u2019t do this adoption. That is only if you have somewhere to go if this all blow up. Otherwise I\u2019d wait until I was 18 and do it then. Do you have anyone else you can confide in? Grandparent? Aunt or Uncle?", "Actually go and apologise or fake apologise and then ask them to re tell them entire story as give some reason about emotional stuff. Side by side record the entire convo secretly and then send to L so that she could use that as a proof to get her daughter back.\n\nNow coming to your post you are the asshole for shouting at a 6year old.", "Esh. You shouldn't scream at a six year old who has been manipulated just as much as your ex stepmum.\n\nOP, you're almost at an age where you're legally an adult. For your own sake, start making plans to escape. Apologise to your sister, she didn't deserve being shouted at. Make a fake apology to your current step mum for the sake of peace. And get a part time job. Save every penny you can. Work hard at school, think carefully about post school life. What do you want to do? Plan for that assuming you won't get financial support from your dad (it's easier to not be controlled when no money is involved). If you want to get a degree, start applying for scholarships now. If you want a job, learn what you need to do to get that job, and what experience you need, and make a plan to get there. Think long term.", "I'm so sorry. Your dad reminds me of mine. You could try to expose the plan but I don't recommend it. If your dad is like mine most won't believe you and the rest won't intervene.  Try not to yell at your sister. She doesn't understand.  Good luck", "NTA. Jesus fucking Christ, I\u2019m so sorry. You could have called them literally anything and you wouldn\u2019t be the asshole", "Given that your sister has no real contact with her mother, your role becomes very important, as you can the only real bridge between the fairy tale that the poisonous couple are creating and the reality that only you want to acknowledge. You have to make sure that you do not burn that bridge, or your sister is going to have her life wrecked by these people. This is hardly fair to you, but you seem to care about your sister- this is the time to be there for her. Do not let her forget her mother. \n\nYour father is a real piece of work. Give him time- he will probably cheat on your current step mom as well.", "I'd say ESH just for the fact that you yelled at your sister, who is a young child and obviously doesn't understand the situation as well as you do, you're TA on that one. I think you definitely need to apologise to her and explain the reason for why you were upset, obviously you don't need to go into full detail, just say that your dad and G made you angry and you're sorry for taking it out on her, it wasn't her fault.\n\nAs for your dad and stepmom they are both absolutely TA for what they're doing, being openly proud of the fact that they're alienating a child from her birth mother, and are boasting about it, really isn't a good look for either of them. Also the fact that G is being openly racist towards you, and your dad isn't doing anything to stop her (i.e. dumping her and putting his child's safety first), also adds another major arsehole point against the both of them.\n\nPersonally, I think G is going to be in for a rude awakening when she finds out your dad is cheating on her with woman number 4, which seems more than likely given his track record, just don't be too shocked if and when that happens.\n\nI'm very sorry that you and your little sister are having to put up with such awful people, you both deserve so much better than that, and M needs to know her bio mom too especially if visitation is still ongoing (none of this 'G is my mommy and L is daddy's friend' nonsense, that'll just cause more issues in the future, especially if dad does find another new stepmom to replace G).", "ESH (except you kids).Dad seems to be a person who is in it to win it, at any cost, and take what ever he wants.There\u2019s a conga line of women who he has paraded through, all of them probably thinking that the previous exes were crazy and neglectful, but probably don\u2019t know the whole truth (and that is that dad will do whatever it takes to get what he wants).\n\nCurrent new mummy (don\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll be replaced eventually) is also in it to win it and manipulative.L should look into alienation of parenting\u2026 and try to get the whole thing tagged as that. Also should realise that no one can take away her parental right so long as she does not sever them through neglect or abuse. No matter WHAT they throw at her in the future she should a) record every conversation she has with both of them, b) only meet for handover in a public place, and c) only ever, ever put that little girls needs and love in the first place, do everything to cherish and protect her WHILE meeting hte legal requirements for her to remain a legal parent (ie meet custody rules, provide documents as needed, attend therapy etc). Then new mummy doesn\u2019t get to adopt her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you? Man.. I hope you are off and away soon to college!  \n\n\nEdit to add\u2026 previous mums don\u2019t suck. New one does. Previous mums we don\u2018t have enough info on (yours, but if all you have to go on is what your dad has said then maybe that needs re examining), and I presume L is not sucking, just in a horrible black hole of nastiness.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your situation. I don't think they're going to realize the error of their ways or learn to treat you respectfully. You already know they're racist, horrible people, so it's like you're in a hostage situation. You can't really treat them as family; they're just the people you're stuck with until you can be free of them. Do your best to survive. If it were me, I wouldn't make waves; you don't have many options as a dependent and a minor. I would just try to keep my head down and fake whatever apologies they wanted, and then try to become independent as fast as possible.", "ESH except your sister and her mom.\n\nThe child is innocent and guillable she's been manipulated and you definitievely shouldn't target her regardless of the absurdities her brainwashed brain makes her say.\n\nYour dad, his new wife and her mother are some of the biggest AHs I ever read about on these boards, move out as soon as you can and cut them off, they'll only bring harm to your wellbeing.", "I have to judge ESH because your half-sister doesn't know any better, don't judge her by behaviour your dad and stepmomster encourage. \n\nThat being said, you can do your former stepmother a big favour by informing her about this. She can sue for a custody revision due to parental alienation.\n\nEdit: obligatory 'not a lawyer' but parental alienation is one of those things that tends to skew custody arrangements.", "Tell L exactly what\u2019s going on, also write it down. See if L will take you in. Your dad is a real AH and his wife is evil.", "ESH, but I do feel like your mistake can be corrected by apologising to your little sister and explaining that you didn't mean what you said. \n\nOther than that, it's genuinely disgusting how your dad and G have been treating you and L. The comment on the color of your skin truly tells me everything I need to know. Hope you can get out of that house soon OP.", "NTA I'm so sorry", "NTA.  Your father and stepmother are monsters.  Try and find a way out ASAP.  Don\u2019t let them infect you.", "ESH.  \nYou suck for sreaming at a six year old and saying mean things to her. That was uncalled for.   \n\n\nYour dad REALLY sucks, hard, for cheating on your stepmom, then replacing her with the woman he was cheating on her with and now trying to replace her as the mom of her daughter.  \n\n\nStepmom sucks for going along with this, cheating with a married man, and speaking badly to you.  \n\n\nLots and lots of suckage going on here.", "NTA for everything except for shouting and pushing  your sister - she's only 6, she's being manipulated horribly by your dad and new stepmonster - do please apologise to her and be kind to her.  She's in an awful situation.It sounds like your dad has a history of lying and manipulating to get full custody - I hope you can reach out to your bio mom some day.

You only slightly because you yelled at your little half sister. She's young and has bad influences. She doesn't know better. You have too so it's only slightly. But M is not being maliciously cruel she is being lied to. Your father and G are telling her a warped story. M cannot learn the truth when figures she thinks she should trust are telling her one thing and making L and you out to be villains.\n\nBut those two do deserve to know their bad people. Being racist to you and showing so much favoritism to your half sister is rotten. But i need to note they are abusing you both. One sided favoritism and showing racism while trying to call you her sister and keep you as family. \n\nApologize to your sister, just on a human level you don't have to be her sister just a decent human being in a house of assholes, and make plans to make things better for you both. \n\nI don't know what the situation looks like. Do you have extended family?  Can you make plans to leave? Maybe to L if she thinks of you as a daughter? You're 17 so you're only a little away from that. I'd say save your little sister but it's not your responsibility to hang around until a baby sees reason. And it's better she's not exposed to a scapegoat/golden child dynamic. \n\nI do think consider leaving a line open for M in the future when she's finding things out to tell her the truth. M will find out the truth and this will blow up on G. It will just take time and L will need support. It's alright to be upset about having no control and about their parental alienation of L.\n\nAdded note: Also you realize this is a pattern right? Not making you hate on L but your Dad did this to your Bio-mom. Maybe L was convinced bio-mom was a danger or maybe she truly was a danger but this is the second time they've pulled parental alienation.", "NTA.

If she has a lawyer, speak to them. Bonus points if you can record their conversation of them admitting it and you pass it onto L for her own court visits. \n\nI second calling CPS about the racism you face in your own home. You need to get out of that home. Is there family you can stay with?", "ESH Your dad and G are manipulating L and treating her like shit\n\nHowever you were absolutely an AH when you yelled at M.

That burn on M's, I wonder if that was dad and G ensuring L didn't get custody. If I were you I'd also be looking at how your father got full custody of you. Can you now trust the reasons your birth mother had no visitation rights given what you have seen your father do? He is the real villain here.

Depending on the laws where you are you will hopefully be able to help prevent this from happening and maybe even be able to help get your sister to have more contact with her bio mom.  I will also say this its not a questionbut a consideration, with what you have seen with this situation do you know for sure what happened with your bio mom?", "NTA, your dad and G are pieces of work to say the least. The part I'm assuming you feel the worst about is your interaction with your stepsister (M I think), you were reacting to what you'd just heard and were at a place emotionally where you weren't thinking too logically (I've been there and feel terrible everytime I snap out of it). Not a great situation but you can't blame yourself, especially because you wouldn't have reacted that way if not for those assholes. Really it's their fault. I'm not sure how 6 yr Olds are mentally so idk if maybe you could sit down with your sister and try to explain that you were extremely upset and (I'm assuming) you didn't mean it or at least didn't mean to hurt her feelings.", "ESH (I mean for you yelling at a 6 year old who is just being manipulated but I understand it's all reached a boiling point)\n\nBut your father and his affair partner are in fact horrible people.

That's the only thing that brings you down to their level. You recognize M is being manipulated by them, yet you are blaming/punishing her when she is too young to recognize it on her own.

Sure. But the way their alienating L is super messed up. They're definitely AH s here, you were just calling them on it. I suggest you start planning now for when you're 18 because they're probably going to kick you out or make life even more hell to push you into choosing to move out. They sound awful.", "NTA but do get in contact with L.

If it makes you feel any better, she showed her dirty hand when she equated dark skin to ugliness. \n\nBoth your father and your stepmother are on the wrong side of history and morals. \n\nKeep your head up, get out of there, and know that the world understands how shit they are and has pity for them.", "NTA\nI don't know what country you reside in or what or if you are in high school.

They plotted to steal a woman's child all because his sidepiece couldn't have a baby on her own. That's some seriously villainous shit right there.

They are manipulating her.", "NTA", "ESH and this is why:\n\nYou're in a bad situation but you screamed at your little sister, who is also a victim in all this. You're 17 - old enough to know better.

I hope you can both get out of this in one piece.", "NTA", "NTA  You called it as you saw it - they started an affair and schemed to take the child away from a vulnerable woman, because your current stepmother can\u2019t have children.  They planned to get full custody of said child and have her adopted by your stepmother.  That\u2019s shitty. The only one who you should apologise to at all is your little sister, who is too young to understand what\u2019s happening in her situation and her place in these wicked games. \n\nYou may end up having to apologise for the ruckus for no other reason than to keep the peace until you move out - but you don\u2019t have to mean it. Throw yourself into your studies so that you can graduate and either study further or get a job. You will get away from these people in one way or another, but sadly when you are 17 and protest, even when you are in the right, things will not be so good for you.  Just use the situation to your advantage for now, because I have a feeling that your father and stepmother will be having the \u201crent and board\u201d conversation with you sooner rather than later if you continue to protest.  If you want to go on to university, you may need financial assistance, but don\u2019t bank on it unless you play nice.  You don\u2019t have to hang around after.\n\nSilver Linings?  Karma is a bitch!  When scheming people get together, they scheme together. Until they don\u2019t, that is.  People who got together by having an affair will always know that since they cheated and broke the trust of their former partners, that they are capable of doing it again with someone else or that they could end up being cheated on.  Schemers who hurt others know that they can be schemed against too.  Mistrust abounds for people like this.  Time and again the Universe has a way of rebalancing.

Parental alienation can be supported by testimony from a licensed therapist and L could demand that the court assign a therapist because she can't trust your dad and G to pick a neutral one.
