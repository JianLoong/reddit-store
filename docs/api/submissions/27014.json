The back seam is the most logical place to open a slit for someone who wants to wear them around like that, because you could make it look like it\u2019s supposed to be that way. It can be repaired and look still pretty close to the manufacturer\u2019s work by applying a patch on the inside and running a topstitch down either side of the center seam. But if there are just random rips in the boots\u2026 she didn\u2019t cut those to wear them around, she cut them afterwards to spite you. \n\nRegardless, I would consider trying to get back his stuff and instead pursuing legal action. Like going to the cops. You\u2019ll have a better time getting any legal recourse if you haven\u2019t engaged in vigilantism about it. If the cops say they can\u2019t do anything\u2026.

They also don't have a zipper or anything. Even if a cobbler could repair the rips it would ruin the main thing i wanted them for.", "She has the right to pursue Mark's gf for the money.

In this case, it wasn't petty revenge, it was justice.", "The right thing to do was to go to the police and press charges against the gf that stole them. If convicted I believe would be asked to pay restitution to you.  It sounds like the roommate did not steal them and if he did the gf would certainly turn him into the police", "I wasn\u2019t going to say anything because I thought it was a typo, but you misspelled \u201cdevided\u201d twice.

You should have called the police for theft, but you broke the law too. Weird.", "NTA. Mark is responsible for the kind of people he brings around your shared living space, and I guarantee she doesn\u2019t do that shit to his stuff.

I'm not in the US where small claims court is a semi-normal thing. \n\nAs campus security told me, if I were to pursue this it would probably take about 5 months before i'd be allowed a first apearance in court.\n\nThen, even though Mark verbaly admitted to me she did it, if i don't have any concrete evidence or a signed confession they won't do shit.\n\nAnd then again, even if i did have that and could prove they did it, it would take multiple court appearances before an actual verdict (and possible restitution) is given. \n\nTLDR: It could take up to year to get it all sorted out and there was a big chance at the end of it i still wouldn't recieve anythging", "Many, if not most, campuses have fully commissioned officers as their campus police.

For a few reasons, one is that it seems like Mark knew she stole them from the beginning, like presumably she\u2019s only in this building where she doesn\u2019t live when she\u2019s with him?

Probably best to not take my idea on this one tbh.

You cant predict what people are going to do so you wont always know to avoid inviting them. He is def responsible for it a little bit but its still mostly on the guest themselves. He owes op the effort to get the gf to pay for the shoes, and if he has a spine hed also leave her. Doesnt mean stealing from him is justified imo.", "She didn\u2019t leave them \u201cin a common area\u201d as in on the floor of the living room, she left them IN A SHOE ORGANIZER THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE DOOR OF HER ROOM.
