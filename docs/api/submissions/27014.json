The back seam is the most logical place to open a slit for someone who wants to wear them around like that, because you could make it look like it\u2019s supposed to be that way. It can be repaired and look still pretty close to the manufacturer\u2019s work by applying a patch on the inside and running a topstitch down either side of the center seam.
