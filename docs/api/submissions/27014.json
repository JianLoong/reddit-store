The back seam is the most logical place to open a slit for someone who wants to wear them around like that, because you could make it look like it\u2019s supposed to be that way. It can be repaired and look still pretty close to the manufacturer\u2019s work by applying a patch on the inside and running a topstitch down either side of the center seam. But if there are just random rips in the boots\u2026 she didn\u2019t cut those to wear them around, she cut them afterwards to spite you. \n\nRegardless, I would consider trying to get back his stuff and instead pursuing legal action.
