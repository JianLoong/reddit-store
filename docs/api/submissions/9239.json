Check your local noise ordinances.  I'm willing to bet there are restrictions on how loud you can be at different times of day.

I guarantee for every person who tells you that you are waking them up every day at 4am, there are probably 10 people who resent being woken up who don't want to confront you about it.

As someone with a couple of really loud old muscle cars and a hot rod, there are ways to still be considerate of your neighbors. Start it as quietly as you can without revving the engine, and idle it away from the houses before you stop to let it warm up. If your driveway is between the houses and it's on a slant, put it in nuetral and coast it out from between the houses before you start it if you can. If you're coming home late at night, get a little speed up so that once you're about a block away from your house you can coast it in there without hitting the gas, and then shut the engine off immediately once you stop. Just try to be a decent neighbor.", "Only douchebags like you would stop and compliment you on such a waste of money. An elderly couple might stop and complement you on an immaculate classic car l, but a fucking challenger?!?! Get real.

And to get your dream car is truly an accomplishment for any of us who are not born with any kind of money.\n\nAnd, I would have hoped someday you\u2019d be showing that neighbor\u2019s kid how we used to have cars, before they were all electric, but you have certainly burned that bridge. In fact, you are creating the perfect condition for a lifelong feud. No, seriously, this will go down in your neighbor\u2019s family history and someday that kid could do something stupid to the \u2018antique gas guzzler next door\u2019, and you\u2019ll be crushed and wonder how/why. I\u2019m now desperately hoping one of you are renters. \n\nYTA, if you want to make noise, you do it at reasonable hours or move where it\u2019s not a problem. Or, if you are a decent human being, both of those things. 4am? So you\u2019re not well off enough to not need to work, and/or you like those hours which is great, but how many houses are you passing and waking? I promise this is not a neighbor problem, the whole neighborhood hates your car. \n\nTake your wife out driving, enter shows, parades, show off that beauty everywhere it can be truly appreciated. And bask in that enjoyment with them, don\u2019t beat people over the head with what you have just because you can. \n\nWhen neighbors compliment you, they are being kind and polite. They are trying to remind you that they are as human as you are, that they can be glad for you and still resent you quietly.", "YTA. I've never understood why someone would purposely want a loud car. Just buying one alone is an AH move, but then to drive it at 4am is next level", "Depends on exactly one thing.

Technically, it is not your responsibility to be quiet at 4 am because you have neighbors. The air is free.

It's a car you have and I'd hazard a guess that it's legal. I have neighbors with loud cars, including one with a race car. I can't stand when someone is idling outside like the other night at 2 am with their loud ass diesel truck but it is what it is.
