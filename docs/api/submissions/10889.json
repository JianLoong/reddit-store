Talking to my wife isn\u2019t getting me anywhere. \n\nSo I\u2019ve told her she now has to pay for the additional energy bills over a set figure, something like 70% of last months bill I\u2019ll keep paying and she pays the rest (I pay the mortgage, childcare and a majority of the household bills, I earn considerably more than my wife who works part time) obviously I don\u2019t want her to pay for the entire energy bill as I work from home etc and that wouldn\u2019t be fair. \n\nAnyway she\u2019s now calling me an asshole and I think it\u2019s the perfect compromise. So people of Reddit, what do you think?\n\nEDIT. I feel like a major piece has been missed. When I say my wife wants to bath them at least every other day, it\u2019s because she would bath them every day. I know that won\u2019t impact most of the commenters but worth pointing out. \n\nAlso stop making out I don\u2019t wash my children and keep them clean. There is a big difference between not having a bath and not having a wash, we\u2019re just talking about lack of baths. \n\nFinal point, although my wife earns less than me, after all the bills etc. are taken out we have the same \u2018cash\u2019 left over every month. My point is she\u2019s spending more money than is needed on hot water for the baths because I take the hot out of my personal money, putting the \u2018cap\u2019 in means she\u2019ll see how much she is spending\n\nAlso GAS in Europe is really expensive.\n\nSecond EDIT.

Bathing frequency is a matter of personal preference and hygiene, and it is not fair to force your children to go without bathing if your wife thinks it's important. Using money as leverage to get your way is not a healthy way to solve a disagreement with your partner, especially when you earn significantly more than her.

Little kids get sweaty, and sweaty kids with unwashed hair generally develop cradle cap. Little kids (esp 3 yr olds) are often still chunky and have little folds of skin which can get sore if not kept clean. They can get sore behind their ears and on their necks.

Even if she bathed them every day, you can't impose she pay extra because it's as family home, and they are children that you parent together. \n\nBut the thing you seem to be missing is that the children benefit from a bath routine, much more than just cleanliness. The reason most parents do it is because of the routine and the calming nature the hot water and bath routine has on them. Again, it's not just about the routine, the calming, the dirt, it's actually also about the type of bacteria and parasites  that kids pass on to each other at school. Some kids have bed bugs, many many many kids carry threadworm eggs. They can be a nightmare to clean out of the house and regular cleansing gives the chance of a clean body to bed and parents a chance to see how their kids skin and hair is, and some close time together. \n\nIf you're kids enjoy it, you shouldn't really be cutting it down, but you can cut down how much water goes in and how hot /long the baths are.
