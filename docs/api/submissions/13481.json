Due to this ever since they were little my SIL (29F) has always pushed for them to have a \"shared\" birthday party. When the girls were younger (1-4) we used to do shared birthday parties. But my husband and I realized that we were always the ones to foot the bill for everything (food, decorations, location etc.). The girls also were complete opposites. My daughter has always been more of a tomboy, while my niece is SUPER girly.\n\nWhen my husband and I told SIL and my brother that we won't be doing the shared birthday's anymore, they we really upset and it started a huge fight. They said they can't afford to throw a nice birthday for my niece but we can, so it makes sense that we pay for it since we're \"family\". \n\nYeah, not gonna fly with my husband and I. So we stuck by what we said and every since the girls have had separate birthday's. \n\nMy daughter and my husband love watching Formula 1 together, and she wanted to have a Formula 1 themed birthday this year.\n\nThe weekend before the birthday we had a family dinner at my parents house. SIL, my brother and niece were present. My parents were asking the girls if they were excited for their upcoming birthday's, and if they were having parties this year?\n\nMy daughter told my parents she is having a Formula 1 themed party this year. SIL answered for my niece and said they're not going to have a party for her because thing's were tight. The conversation was left there.\n\nFast forward to this past weekend (daughters bday was on Saturday) we had the party and it was going great. The whole family was invited as usual, and everyone was having a great time until the cake. \n\nI'm in the kitchen with my mom, MIL, SIL and a few other family friends talking. I pull the cake out to get it ready to bring out for everyone. SIL takes a look at the cake and looks confused.\n\nSIL: \"is this the girls birthday cake?\" \n\nMe: \"what do you mean 'the girls'? the cake is for \\*daughters name\\*\"\n\nSIL: \"well I thought since I mentioned that thing's are tight this year, that you'd include \\*niece's name\\* in the birthday?\"\n\nMe: \"I understand your situation, but how come you never once mentioned this to me?\"\n\nSIL: \"Well I thought it would be common sense? Now my daughter isn't going to have any kind of celebration for her birthday this year because you and you husband are so selfish\". \n\nShe then stormed out of the kitchen, made a huge scene at the party outside yelling to her husband and my niece that it's time to go and left. Since then she's been messaging me and my husband non stop trying to make us feel guilty that my niece isn't going to have a birthday party, and calling us all kinds of names.\n\nI feel bad that my niece isn't going to get a birthday party.

Secondly, it\u2019s ridiculous for her to think that hinting around will get her daughter added to the party.  If it was as important to her as she acts like it is then she should have had a frank conversation with you and simply asked.

How much money can you possibly invest in an 8yo birthday party?\n\nMost of my kid's birthdays have been at the park with a self-made chocolate cake, some sweets, a fruit salad, a treasure hunt and some balloons.

Also the kids are getting older and they are not twins, they are cousins. They need separate birthdays.", "NTA. You don't need to have a ton of money to throw a kid a birthday party.

Your SIL n brother sound incredibly entitled.", "NTA.\n\nWhile your niece deserves to feel celebrated and loved, it's not your responsibility to foot the bill for her party.\n\nHaving a shared birthday was fine when they were younger, but given your SIL never chipped in to those, you made the decision to stop doing them, and that was your right as a parent. That doesnt give SIL the right to be entitled to your daughter's cake or party.\n\nMaybe if she didn't rely on you every year to do everything for *her* daughter's birthday, then she would've been more prepared and her daughter would've had the birthday SIL so desperately wants.", "NTA- thats on her.

Anyway visiting with a gift on your nieces birthday will be a good sign.", "NTA- SIL is crazy. If she cant afford a box cake and icing and invite a couple of friends over to play then she needs to really evaluate things. She is entitled.

I get things being tight, and they only want the best for their child, but it should never come at your expense unless you agreed.\n\nSIL is acting entitled, it's good youve set boundaries. Ignore her, you did right. \n\nI hope your kid enjoyed the party!", "NTA. Yes, your niece is family, but you\u2019re not responsible for her party. Being able to pay for something is not an obligation to pay for her party, and good for you for putting an end to being taken advantage of.", "That you're not at all responsible for your niece's birthday is beside the point. \n\nIf she wanted you to put your niece's name on the cake too, she needed to *ask*.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all.\n\nYou don't need a lot of money to celebrate a birthday.

You\u2019re still family and as such should try and work things out but they do sound entitled and lacking in any social grace. Therefore be blunt and just say it how it is and what they need to contribute. If they disagree then hold your parties without them.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s absurd your SIL and brother just expected you to have a cake for their kid without talking to you first. \n\nI also understand that you don\u2019t want to foot the entire bill for a shared birthday party and generally don\u2019t want to have a shared party because their interests are different.\n\nI do however think it would be nice if you\u2019d have a cake for your niece in the future. You don\u2019t have to, but it would be nice.", "NTA - It's not like your niece can't still be celebrated for her birthday. You SIL needs to grow up and give her daughter a lesson in life at the same time. Not everyone can afford the same things.

If you are doing someone a favor, it isn't owed.  You might want to do it because they are family or because you want to help or for any reason you decide, but you don't owe.  OP doesn't owe a birthday party for the cousin. That isn't how favors work, even within families.", "NTA not your kid not your responsibility \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA. Shared birthdays suck. I hope your daughter enjoyed her birthday!", "NTA. Quit answering her messages. Block her if necessary. You told them before that you will no longer do joint birthday parties, so for her to assume that you were doing it this year is presumptuous of her. Don't entertain that. I feel bad for your niece, but only because she has such a clueless mom.", "NTA", "NTA. Your SIL has gotten used to sponging off of you for the birthday party, and is now upset you have set a boundary. And she tried ambushing you about it at the party. You were right: if she wanted to share again, she needed to ask you explicitly, not just hint and hope you read her mind, especially since you told her you weren\u2019t sharing anymore. \n\nAnd it was selfish of her to make a scene in the middle of the party - to punish your daughter for a dispute between the two of you.", "NTA. Buy your niece something extra cool and leave it at that. If the SIL can't afford a cake mix and bake a cake well that's on her. Maybe her side could lend a hand.", "NTA, though I feel worse for the poor child who has to live with her", "NTA. You don't owe your niece a birthday party, or anything else, for that matter.", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA. They could throw their daughter a birthday party by making a boxed cake and setting up some balloons/decorations at a park for under $20.", "NTA\n\nThere is another compromise that could have been used once the shared birthdays stopped. Have a separate family only party that includes both children. That way the child gets the party with their friends and themed how they like, and the family gets to celebrate together.\n\nIn my family, there are a lot of shared parties. \n\n1) My sister, son and I have same birth month\n\n2) My wife and niece share a month\n\n3) My dad and another niece share a month\n\n4) My BIL and another niece share a month\n\n5) My MIL and another niece share month\n\n6) My other sister was born on Christmas. Talk about sucky sharing of a date.\n\nWe have always had like 2 or 3 birthdays to get everyone together. The themed party always was with just children's friends unless child only wanted to have one with all the family. Talk about date planning nightmares with like 15 people's schedules.\n\nI also agree with others that brother and SIL should be planning better and saving for a party for their child. I never understood why every birthday had to be over the top themed and expensive. If you want to do that than go for it. Most children I have ever dealt with, would have been happy to have a themed decorated cake, maybe character plates and napkins that can be had cheap on Amazon, and maybe some streamers and a sign. We have a large handing \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" sign that we have recycled for like 10 years for 2 son's birthdays through the years.\n\nAgain, NTA. Entitled people suck.", "Wow, the projection is strong in SIL. SIL is pushing the blame that SHE can't provide for her daughter's birthday on to you when the only people to blame are her and Brother. It is not OP's responsibility to provide these things for her niece. OP's daughter is OP's responsibility/priority, full stop. It is not OP's responsibility to provide anything for someone else's family.

Inexpensive but divided over the years was a couple bucks a year for a special cake. \n\nYour SIL doesn't care enough about her kid to try. Can you feed your kid? If so, then make their favorite food. Can you afford a $1 box of cake mix? Then you can spend a few hours making a cake. That's a family birthday party. \n\nCan't afford food for many people?

Due to this ever since they were little my SIL (29F) has always pushed for them to have a \"shared\" birthday party. When the girls were younger (1-4) we used to do shared birthday parties. But my husband and I realized that we were always the ones to foot the bill for everything (food, decorations, location etc.). The girls also were complete opposites. My daughter has always been more of a tomboy, while my niece is SUPER girly.\n\nWhen my husband and I told SIL and my brother that we won't be doing the shared birthday's anymore, they we really upset and it started a huge fight. They said they can't afford to throw a nice birthday for my niece but we can, so it makes sense that we pay for it since we're \"family\". \n\nYeah, not gonna fly with my husband and I. So we stuck by what we said and every since the girls have had separate birthday's. \n\nMy daughter and my husband love watching Formula 1 together, and she wanted to have a Formula 1 themed birthday this year.\n\nThe weekend before the birthday we had a family dinner at my parents house. SIL, my brother and niece were present. My parents were asking the girls if they were excited for their upcoming birthday's, and if they were having parties this year?\n\nMy daughter told my parents she is having a Formula 1 themed party this year. SIL answered for my niece and said they're not going to have a party for her because thing's were tight. The conversation was left there.\n\nFast forward to this past weekend (daughters bday was on Saturday) we had the party and it was going great. The whole family was invited as usual, and everyone was having a great time until the cake. \n\nI'm in the kitchen with my mom, MIL, SIL and a few other family friends talking. I pull the cake out to get it ready to bring out for everyone. SIL takes a look at the cake and looks confused.\n\nSIL: \"is this the girls birthday cake?\" \n\nMe: \"what do you mean 'the girls'? the cake is for \\*daughters name\\*\"\n\nSIL: \"well I thought since I mentioned that thing's are tight this year, that you'd include \\*niece's name\\* in the birthday?\"\n\nMe: \"I understand your situation, but how come you never once mentioned this to me?\"\n\nSIL: \"Well I thought it would be common sense? Now my daughter isn't going to have any kind of celebration for her birthday this year because you and you husband are so selfish\". \n\nShe then stormed out of the kitchen, made a huge scene at the party outside yelling to her husband and my niece that it's time to go and left. Since then she's been messaging me and my husband non stop trying to make us feel guilty that my niece isn't going to have a birthday party, and calling us all kinds of names.\n\nI feel bad that my niece isn't going to get a birthday party. AITA for not including her even though they can't afford it?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If her parents had just used their words and communicated like adults, this all could have been avoided. Especially since even if you HAD randomly decided to add your niece\u2019s name to the cake, I bet she\u2019d still be upset. A name on a cake doesn\u2019t magically make it equally her party. Would the other kids have known she was being celebrated? If not, would they/their parents have thought to bring gifts for her as well? I\u2019m guessing they wouldn\u2019t have, which would likely be even more devastating for the poor kid, because she wouldn\u2019t understand why.\n\nIf your SIL or (ahem) **brother** had come to you with their concerns, something could have been arranged. They did not do that, so the blame lies squarely with them. Please give your niece a hug and let her know she\u2019s loved. You\u2019re NTA.\n\n\n*Ps, wanted to quickly add some important points here that I wanted to be sure were also clear.\n\n1) When I say \u201csomething could have been arranged\u201d or \u201cthey should have come to you\u201d, I hope you know that I don\u2019t believe in the slightest that this should be you and your husband\u2019s responsibility. You are not your niece\u2019s only family, and weren\u2019t the only ones who heard SIL\u2019s comments at dinner either. I only say that you could have helped if asked because that was the specific situation presented. If your brother and SIL are mad at you, then they better be mad at their parents and other siblings as well. Otherwise, that burden is even MORE unfair.\n\n2) I know this must be hard for your brother and SIL as well. It\u2019s not easy to admit that you can\u2019t give your children everything you think they deserve. I\u2019m sure they have some really uncomfortable feelings about themselves and their own perceived failings because of this. Honestly, it\u2019s very likely that\u2019s why SIL lashed out the way she did. That being said, though, it still doesn\u2019t excuse their behaviour towards you. Just wanted to make sure that was said anyways, as frustration and hurt can sometimes crowd out our compassion.\n\nAnd oh, right\n\n3. I absolutely freaking love that your little one went for a Formula 1 party!!
