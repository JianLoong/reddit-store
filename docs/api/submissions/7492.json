Who owns the home?", "INFO: why does your partner feel like you should work? What\u2019s their reasoning? \n\nAnd also how are expenses and chores distributed?

Your partner may feel that \"work\" as opposed to volunteering can help with that ie can be a bigger challenge and push yourself to a better space. It could also be that your partner sees your pro bono work as people taking advantage of you. \n\nOr perhaps your partner is thinking more long term - that although your cash flow is adequate now, in 30 years with inflation, more healthcare needed etc, it may not suffice. \n\nOr your partner is perhaps jealous that you're grind is done, but theirs is ongoing. How did they cope with your near death? HCW burnout is real. Perhaps they have their own issues that's manifesting here. \n\nThis is not an easy one to judge without fully understanding your partner's motives.", "Info: will this impact/delay your partners ability to retire.", "INFO: What is your partner\u2019s reason for suggesting you bring in an income?

Is your current financial arrangement not sustainable long term?", "INFO: So let me get this clear: You split expenses 50/50 but your partner works 40 hours a week for income and you work 20 hours or less for (some? no?) income? Are you picking up extra work around the house to lessen their chore load? Are you willing to pick up more work so they can work less? In short, what are your partner's stated concerns? \n\nIs anything you two bring in going to savings? Yeah, you have a lot, but mortgage or no mortgage there's the property taxes every year and those just keep going up and up.\n\nETA: Several people have mentioned you may have a pension, or be on disability, or spending from income on your investments, but it would help to clarify as I think this is the crux of the issue: Is your partner asking you to work because they're worried about money or because they're jealous? These are two very different motives.", "Info: Are you contributing to the household finances and chores evenly? Or are they taking on the brunt of everything?

Even though he had the summers off and got paid, she still somewhat resented all the free time he had to just do whatever he wanted.  It wasn't rational, she would even tell you that.  But her having to get up, go to work, be tired, etc, while he would go to the beach or baseball games just drove her crazy.  \n\nIf your finances are totally fine for you to not work, and he isn't just the only person supporting you, you aren't wrong.  But I'm also not surprised at how he feels.", "NAH if you\u2019re able to continue to contribute financially 50/50 for the rest of your life this way.

Good luck!", "INFO: Could you two get by if your husband retired right now too? Are you not working because your mental health is still bad or because you\u2019d rather do this charity work?\n\nIf he can\u2019t retire because his money is needed to keep you going then yes, you\u2019d be an asshole.

If so you should reflect that in your post because it reads like you have no income and don't contribute.", "NAH. I can sympathize with both of you. Is your partner financially struggling? You mentioned overtime and that they are a healthcare worker. This has been an incredibly stressful two years for those in that profession and this might be their frustration coming out.  \n\nIf you can pay your own way without needing to work why would you purposely jump back into the work force ? \n\nI think you need to figure out what this push to get you into the workforce is. If it's not a financial need then there is def a reason behind it that's less straight forward. Open and honest communication is needed here.", "NAH, if you're still paying 50% of expenses, but financial disagreements are like the #1 reason long-term relationships break up.

We both work FT. I would be pretty annoyed if he were just sitting at home all day doing whatever he wanted while I was toiling away IF by him working just a little, it would make my retirement goal come to fruition sooner. \n\nI dunno. I do a lot of volunteer work too and derive a lot of joy from it. And I\u2019ve just enjoyed 5 weeks off work (had a lot of vacay to burn) so I totally know I\u2019d love being retired and focusing on my volunteer stuff and hobbies like I\u2019ve been doing on this staycation.

He feels like he is doing the full time rate race to support you enjoying a very comfortable early retirement. I\u2019ve been there and it\u2019s hard - yes, the bills are paid, yes, it would have been a struggle for my partner to go back to work, and yes, on some level I was glad to provide for him such that he didn\u2019t have to. But I still felt uncomfortable sometimes, like I was working so hard and he was just having fun all day. And that, with time, he was becoming less and less employable so that if something happened and I couldn\u2019t work for a time, we\u2019d be at financial risk.\n\nI don\u2019t think this means you need to go to work, but I do think you need to have more conversations with your partner to figure out what you both need and can contribute so you both feel your best.", "NAH. you retired early for the sake of your health & you can afford to do this, but that being said, if you can only afford this due to his income and you are now capable of working 2-3 days a week, I can see why he might be thinking that if you managed a day or 2 of work then he might be able to drop a day or 2 himself and you could get extra time together to both enjoy an early retirement of sorts.\nI'd have another chat together before completely ruling it out and find out if he just thinks that you should work or if there are any unspoken reasons.", "YTA. Your happiness comes at the expense of your partner.

You probably need to be a Real Partner and Step Up. What happens if your Partner gets sick or disabled or laid off?

You don't have to go back toa soul-crushing 40+ hours a week role, but even a little income will help your partner out immensely. Look for something that gives you that rewarding feeling and makes you glad to get out of bed in the morning", "Well very gentle YTA. For me it's unfair if one of the partners is not working when they are able. What if your husband decides to quit, would you be OK with you working while he does volunteer work? I'm not sure what health problems you have but a parttime job in a non stressful environment will increase your income and show your partner that you appreciate his efforts.", "YTA\n\nThe problem I see is that even if you are still contributing your 50% share to expenses, that money is coming out of somewhere/ either your savings or your retirement funds. \nGreat that you have them, but at some point they will run short or be depleted. \nAt that time you will be expecting your partner to pay all expenses. \n\nDo you realistically have enough of your own independent money to support half of this household for another 30 years? Because you very well could live that long. \n\nYour combined cash and investments seems like a lot, but half of that ( let\u2019s say your half if it\u2019s evenly contributed) is 750,000. \n750,000 divided over 30 years is only $25,000 per year. Obviously with no growth. \nIs that enough for you to cover your half for 30 yrs?\nHow about when your partner retires, will your own money be enough to travel if you feel like or to do whatever you two have talked about?  \n\nYou need to add some income to this partnership if you want it to remain happy and healthy.", "YTA. \n\nPro bono on your own dime and your own time.

If it\u2019s the latter yeah I can see why a 40s person is uncomfortable using that to support a working aged person in the present. This becomes less of a solid issue imo if you\u2019re receiving a pension from your forced retirement. But at 40 someone is probably still thinking about future goals like \u201cone day I want to buy a lake house or grand 30 day vacation or renovate the kitchen\u201d and knowing that they\u2019ll have shoulder that cost on one income makes their goals hard. Do they have a goal like that? \n\nIf it\u2019s more the emotional aspect of not wanting a retired partner, this sounds like a come to Jesus moment.
