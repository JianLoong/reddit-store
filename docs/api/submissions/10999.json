All the while she has quit jobs without having another one lined up, spent money on knick-knacks, and 100s on whatever her newest hobby is.

Since quitting her job, she has spent money on more knick-knacks and going to different fun events, etc.\n\nOur friend group is going to see a movie this weekend and today I asked her if she was planning to come with us.

You're neither doing her not yourself a favor by enabling this. It sounds like she might seriously be in need of help. It sounds like she uses buying knick knacks as a coping mechanism for something and it's likely this will not magically get better. The earlier she is confronted with something needing to change the better.\n\nThere are a bunch of things you can do as friends that don't require a lot of money and I would encourage you to do some of those together. Like a nice hike with some homemade cake.\n\nOne exception though: I think helping out with gas money for longer drives is reasonable. We do the same in our friend group so the financial burden of visiting someone further away doesn't just fall on one person.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is a mooch.  Stop enabling the mooching.", "NTA.

But is that really what's happening here? When has she covered something for you? I have friends where sometimes I pay and sometimes they pay. One of them has had an unfortunate string of job issues that started with C-19. I've insisted on paying when she didn't have a job. However, she insists on paying when she has the money. \n\nThat's how a friendship works when you spot each other sometimes. It's not you always spotting her and her doing nothing for you. You are NTA And she's going to be really mad that her little gravy train here derailed, but you got to stick to your guns because it's the only way to get it through her head that you're no longer paying for her stuff.", "Why are you even friends with her if you have nothing good to say about her and she constantly mooches off of you?\n\nNTA, but, honestly, you need to reconsider this friendship.", "NTA. The most loving thing you can do for this \"friend\" (who obviously just uses people for money) is to give her Dave Ramsey's total money makeover book and tell her that no matter what you won't give her any more money. No gas. No food. If she doesn't want to be your friend anymore you haven't lost a friend, you've lost a parasite pretending to be your friend. Tough love is real love. You're right to stop enabling her. Spotting friends money is only for people who pay you back in a timely manner because they forgot their wallet or something. Good luck!", "NTA, but this is a conversation that you should've had a while ago (or stop spotting her).\n\nJust a \"Sorry, cant this time\".

You don't need to give a reason or get into a discussion with her when turning her down.  You can just say no, that you can't help out right now and leave it at that.

Like if it\u2019s an accident and someone forgot their wallet or someone is really broke but it hasn\u2019t been a problem before, sure. But if I had to spot someone more than 2-3 times, I would definitely assume they were taking advantage, unless they paid back when they got paid. It\u2019s really weird to me that a friend would feel entitled to your money, because that\u2019s what this is. And it is EXTREMELY weird to me that you give her gas money to come see you.
