Tell your midwife that all communication will only be through you and not to pass on any information to anyone.\n\nGet your husband involved, let him tell his mother that if she continues to intrude into your life like this then she will be removed from all communication until after the birth of the baby.  Tell her you will get her friend fired if she intrudes in any way on your case.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA she's clearly full of herself to the point her son knows her behavior like the back of his hand. Have your husband talk to his mother to either wrangle her into sanity, or make her aware if she pushes boundaries she won't have to worry about a grandkid calling her anything.", "NTA and \"mama\" is NOT the Chinese word for grandma, that would be \"Nai Nai\". \"MaMa\" and \"Baba\" are the Chinese names for mom/dad. \n\nSo lying to you on that. Just another bullet point in the list of creepy things. She's somehow trying to paint herself as the 2nd mom to retain her youth? Weird and weird. Hooray your husband backs you up on this.", "NTA. Your MIL obviously has issues of her own, but she needs to deal with them and stop making them your problem.  You are happy and excited and she has no right to put a damper on that.  Maybe your comment to her will jolt her a bit and bring her back to reality.", "NTA.\n\nYour MIL is being narcissistic and meddling in your personal affairs. I could kind of understand her reactions, on some level, until the midwife thing., that was completely unacceptable and a massive boundary violation. You've given her several chances by this point, she needed to be checked.", "NTA and I can see this behaviour escalating. Might be time to think about going non contact.", "NTA\n\n It's not uncommon for expectant parents to have certain expectations and hopes for their pregnancy announcement, and your MIL's response seemed to detract from the joyous occasion. Furthermore, her request to be called \"Mama\" instead of grandma and her involvement in your midwife appointment without your consent can be seen as crossing boundaries. It's important to establish clear communication and boundaries with family members during pregnancy and parenting.\n\nExpressing your frustration and setting boundaries with your MIL is a reasonable response. It's essential for you and your husband to be on the same page and support each other in dealing with such situations. It might be beneficial to have an open and honest conversation with your MIL, explaining how her actions have made you feel and what boundaries you would like to establish moving forward.\n\nRemember that pregnancy is a special and personal time for you and your husband, and it's important to prioritize your well-being and create an environment that is supportive and respectful.", "NTA. She needs to respect social mores and boundaries and get some damn therapy over her youth hangup.", "NTA. Inviting someone you don\u2019t know into a medical appointment?! Absolutely not.", "NTA. She has been rather rude about the whole thing so far, but inviting a stranger to you appointment without your permission or knowledge is so far over the line that I can\u2019t even imagine where she is coming from. I would hope that any medical professional would have the ethics to talk to the patient first before even entertaining the idea. And, if your midwife was going to allow this without talking to you first - find another one, one with actual ethics.", "NTA.  Make sure you and your husband keep a united front and decide how to deal with this.  Give her something positive to do like getting one of those books on how to be wonderful granny, to channel her enthusiasm in the right way ( the one I read had a whole chapter on what *not* to do as a granny, which might be helpful to you). Then set your boundaries, don't tell her about any of your other appointments and make sure your midwife knows this. On the plus side now that she's coming round to the idea she might be an enthusiastic babysitter later on.", "NTA. You were experiencing insufferable  but routine behavior from MIL. A talking to her seemed like it might have some chance of making things better.\n\nThe midwife incident was so far beyond any reasonable action that it's clear the MIL knows no and will respect no boundaries. Given that, I don't think you're likely to be able to talk sense into her.\n\nShe's turning your journey into parenthood into an unenjoyable continuous fight where it's all about her and what she wants. Looks like it's time for low contact and/or an info diet. You shouldn't have to put up with this.", "NTA. She sounds awful.", "NTA: Your MIL thinks she too young my own father was only 36 when he became a grandparent my Mum just turn 40. \n\nStrange neither one carried on about being too old you MIL is ridiculous.", "NTA Wow she sounds exhausting! I say do yourself a favor and limit any contact or information shared.  She's not going to like any names you pick, or your birth plan, or who you have with you while you deliver, or what color the crib sheets are, she'll share pictures without your permission, etc. It's all going to be about her.  For your own sanity it might be best to cut her off until the baby arrives.  Based on her behavior between now and then you can decide how to proceed. \n\nIf she asks why, tell her you agree it's clear she's too young to be a grandma b/c she's acting so childishly about it.  \n\nCall your midwife and explain what happened.  Set up a password with them concerning any appointment changes.  No correct password = no changes. You might need to  do the same when it comes time to give birth.  Have passwords set up, that way MIL can't make changes behind your back.", "Honestly, for that overstep alone, my kid would call her Granny.   NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
