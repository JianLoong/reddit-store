When I was a child, I was very non verbal with strangers. Even into my early teen years, I only spoke through my parents, siblings, or close friends to strangers. At the doctors office, ordering at restaurants, strangers on the street commenting on my appearance, etc.. I always spoke through the ones I trusted.\n\nI\u2019ve, unfortunately, had too many experiences in my childhood of people treating me differently because I wouldn\u2019t talk with them. They didn\u2019t care for the reasoning, they would just be rude. I\u2019ve been called a brat, a liar, an attention seeker, a prude, etc.. You stood up for your child nicely, explained the issue and the woman was small minded and ableist in her response.\n\nAlso, ignore the comments saying you were out for revenge or spreading this to make that woman a social pariah. You didn\u2019t do that. You gave a word of warning to other parents who may have socially anxious kids or (as you stated there were special Ed parents too) kids with autism or other disabilities that could make that house a horrible experience for them. Nor did you make a group chat, but messaged in an already made one. You didn\u2019t make anyone post about it anywhere else or encourage people to prank her house.

You were perfectly right to have told her in the moment why yr kid didn't speak; and a great idea to have all the kids give back their candy.

I remember once when I was a kid I was grounded for a bit over a month because I hadn\u2019t heard a neighbor say hello and hadn\u2019t seen her. She accused me of ignoring her on purpose. Apparently she had been on her porch, which was decently far back from the sidewalk, and I used to look at my feet when walking because I would trip very often if I wasn\u2019t looking down. It was absolutely ridiculous, but she had seen moments where my hearing was overly sensitive and decided that there was no way in hell I didn\u2019t hear her. I have pretty bad auditory processing issues and sensory issues, but so many people seem to just refuse to understand that those things can change throughout the day, especially if trying to focus on something or being overwhelmed by something (in that case I was focused on walking and trying to not trip/had already fallen a couple times and was frustrated/overwhelmed). Worst part was that she refused to let me and her daughter play together anymore, who was probably my best friend at the time. My parents always saw my symptoms as me misbehaving, not as me having a genuine struggle.\n\nYou did the right thing, the person you dealt with is ableist as hell and just plain unkind. Not only did you defend your daughter, but you helped other parents avoid her mistreating their children as well. You remind me of my childhood best friend\u2019s mom, she would generally be the one who took us out trick or treating and would ask me if I am comfortable enough to speak or not before houses. If I told her no, she would let them know that I don\u2019t speak, and my best friend would say it twice. She did more for me than my own family and I will absolutely never forget her for always looking out for me. She helped me feel more comfortable in a world where I tend to feel out of place.\n\nThank you for advocating for your child, for looking out for her and for other children regardless of whether they are autistic or not. She will remember that and your other children will as well. You are raising them with empathy and showing them that you want to be there and understand them. Just\u2026 thank you. You seem like a good mom who understands the difference between enabling someone and helping them be comfortable. Being forced to speak and do other things only made me less and less comfortable and more avoidant over the years.

They told me they moved here from India last year and their parents didn't know where to get costumes. \n\nFriendly, safe interactions with adults is how kids learn how to become friendly, safe adults in the world. I could have told them to fuck off and sent them away without candy, but why? Why isn't it better to err on the side of being kind to kids?", "About 20% of my kids this year were teens that have been coming by for the last 5 years. They know they get a full-size bar no matter what they're wearing and they're always super polite. Makes them and me happy. They're out being silly instead of getting into trouble and I love it.", "Yep - I even hand out candy to older siblings just escorting the kids - after all - why not!", "People around here give treats to adults in costume who are taking kids trick or treating too. I got a bag full last night. \ud83e\udd70", "I doubt the teenagers peaking the house was related to OP's next-door post. \n\nIf that lady was willing to keep candy away from a little kid for not saying trick or treat; you know she's the type that if you even look like you might be a bit older she won't give you candy. \n\nShe probably earned the ire of the neighborhoodlums on her own merit.\n\nEdit: pranking not peaking, stupid giant fingers\n\nEdit 2: It's been brought to my attention that I was wrong OP didn't do a next-door post about crappy neighbor but just messaged her parent group, but my point still stands.", "Can't really agree with the OP causing the pranks, teens will be teens and who knows why they decided to target the house and what they did. I don't support pranks like egging but there can be non-damaging pranks that a homeowner like that will hate no matter what it is.\n\nBut the pranks are not the OP's fault and neither are the lack of trick or treaters. People have the free will to make their own decisions after being given accurate information. Hopefully the homeowner will understand that her actions prevented her from getting the trick or treaters and will be kinder to children who can't or won't say some silly words.", "I used to live in one of those neighborhoods, we made a haunted house in our garage.

I'm the single house on a dead-end street, and I guess it's too much work or they're not even aware of my house.\n\nOne year, a neighbor kid I was friendly with did show up with a couple of friends.  I had joked to him that it was a shame I never get trick or treaters, because I hand out $20 bills.\n\nI gave them each, like, ten full-sized candy bars and they were happy enough.\n\nI don't even bother to buy candy any more.", "A cousin of mine invited me over to help with halloween that year. We basically had a bowl of candy and a bowl of non candy treats and put them on a table at the end of the driveway. We then sat in chairs outside by her garage in costume.

I usually have to go back and correct things because my speak-to-text is weird lol\n\nTbh I do wonder what OP said in the chat to the other people that it has now ballooned out of control.

Of course it could\u2019ve been like that game of telephone where someone else said something other than the truth and made it worse on their own. The reason that I think teenagers pranking the house is due to OP only because it seems like OP might think the same thing. Otherwise why would they have mentioned it? And if neighbor lady has earned the ire of the entire neighborhood and no one really cares for it then why were people going to her house for candy in the first place? She seems nice enough to be handing out bags with full-size candy bars. Like seriously, who does that anymore? \n\nIdk why all of a sudden the lady decided she wasn\u2019t handing the candy bar out to any kids who didn\u2019t say trick-or-treat.

When we took her and her siblings trick or treating we have run into one or two houses where they were insistent she say Trick or Treat. Thankfully all but one backed down when we told them she has a speech disorder but one house was rude about it. They made it seem like we were lying to cover for her being shy or something.
