People made their own decisions on whether or not to go to the house but I\u2019m glad to see so many were supporting neurodivergent kids. \n\nWe gave out full-size candy bars last night and there were kids who were so excited they forgot to say trick-or-treat or thank you.

I live in one of the go to neighborhoods for trick or treating and we regularly get over 500 kids come to our door. I don't make them perform for the candy. There is no transaction here beside you show up, you get candy. No costume? You still get candy. Senior in high school? Awesome, here is some candy.", "NTA. People who are mean to kids because they're neurodivergent, or because they have disabilities, or even just because they're shy or don't jump through hoops on command deserve what they get. The E S Hs here are so worried about her poor hurty feelings about being piled on - well, she earned them with her behavior, unlike the child she was cheerfully willing to single out and treat cruelly for the crime of having a disability. Maybe a little public shaming will teach her what she apparently lacks the heart to figure out on her own - there is no reason ever to single out and pick on a small child for being different.", "ESH.

And you helped prevent parents with ND children from dealing with that.", "NTA\n\nAs an autistic person myself, I understand your thinking of wanting to warn others and give you kudos as a parent of an autistic kid. When I was a child, I was very non verbal with strangers. Even into my early teen years, I only spoke through my parents, siblings, or close friends to strangers. At the doctors office, ordering at restaurants, strangers on the street commenting on my appearance, etc.. I always spoke through the ones I trusted.\n\nI\u2019ve, unfortunately, had too many experiences in my childhood of people treating me differently because I wouldn\u2019t talk with them. They didn\u2019t care for the reasoning, they would just be rude. I\u2019ve been called a brat, a liar, an attention seeker, a prude, etc.. You stood up for your child nicely, explained the issue and the woman was small minded and ableist in her response.\n\nAlso, ignore the comments saying you were out for revenge or spreading this to make that woman a social pariah. You didn\u2019t do that. You gave a word of warning to other parents who may have socially anxious kids or (as you stated there were special Ed parents too) kids with autism or other disabilities that could make that house a horrible experience for them. Nor did you make a group chat, but messaged in an already made one. You didn\u2019t make anyone post about it anywhere else or encourage people to prank her house. You were just looking out for the well being of other kids and the stress it would cause them and their parents.", "NTA. You were looking out for A) your daughter B) your friends kids who may have a similar experience. She should\u2019ve just lightened the hell up and given your daughter some candy just cause she didn\u2019t say 3 meaningless words", "NTA. Discriminating against a kid, doubling down.  You warned others so they could protect their kids from ignorant asshole behavior. \n\nMake shame great again. \n\nFor what it's worth, my son has an auditory processing disorder and a speech impediment. Sometimes he forgets to say please and thank you because he gets overly excited. I'd have done the exact same thing you did tbh. Fortunately for me, the people in my area are just jazzed that any kids are out trick or treating, they even gave candy to adults and teenagers. \n\nTldr: she was a jerk and deserved to be called out and the other parents deserve the chance to protect their kids from bad interactions with strangers on a holiday about fun, generosity and a sense of community", "NTA", "NTA. The lady at that house is an ableist AH.", "NTA. People who are assholes to six-year-olds so they can pull some sort of petty power trip are pathetic and deserve to be put on blast. If she was cruel to your kid she'll be cruel to others.", ">I texted a group chat with parents in my daughters classes, **both general ed** and special ed,\n\nTossing between nta and possibly a mild esh. While I think messaging the special ed class makes sense as you don't want kids of similar needs to face the same issue, messaging both might have been a smidge vindictive. \n\nHowever, you didn't say \"target this person, they're a b*tch\", you just explained your experience and warned other parents who might face similar issues then let them judge for themselves.", "ESH, esp in these days of social media. You were perfectly right to have told her in the moment why yr kid didn't speak; and a great idea to have all the kids give back their candy. That should've given her something to think about.\n\nBut there is a danger these days in letting word spread like that. People will see this as a justification to pile on the perceived \"offender.\" I'm surprised this woman didn't get death threats (maybe she has). She shouldn't be so publicly shamed like that. I'm sure that rather than her having \"pranks\" played on her, you would much prefer that she learn from the experience and realize why her behavior was unacceptable.\n\nSo I would not have texted anybody about it for fear of having something like what you describe happen. It's also why I have never signed up for NextDoor. From what I've been told, it's all about people attacking each other.\n\nIf you are on it, though, perhaps you could go on and explain your side, adding that people shouldn't let their attacks get out of hand.", "Don't want attention? Don't have shitty behavior. \n\nIf more people were called out on their asshole behavior maybe we would have less assholes....\n\nNTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why that woman couldn\u2019t just give your daughter the goodie bag after you explained that she is autistic. She seems like an ableist person who lacks empathy.", "NTA. People needed to know about her ableist behaviour", "ESH. She was rude to the kids. I agree with giving back the bags and leaving.\n\nYour first thought was to text everyone and spread it around.  Just go about your business.", "NTA, people that are cruel to children deserve to be called out for it.", "Nta\n\nYou didn't mention targeting this woman. You said what happened to your daughter. \n\n\nWhat makes this nta not E S H for me is she didn't even apologize.\n\n\nShe made an assumption that led to this behavior from others. She failed to apologize.  She probably took it as rudeness, not because your daughter is autistic. \n\n\nHonestly, she got what she had coming. When you mess up, you apologize.  \n \nI feel for your daughter.", "NTA. Hugely ableist lady. Last night we had kids who spoke, kids who signed, kids who said nothing, kids who spoke English, kids who spoke other languages, kids who said thank you, kids who didn't, kids who took one, kids who took a handful...and we did. not. care. !!!!!!! It was fun! As long as the kids were having fun, we were having fun! Oh, and we have no kids so I don't want to hear any of the \"she must not have children\" crap. You don't have to have kids to have common sense and basic decency.", "NTA. She doubled down on her ignorant behavior even when you explained the situation. Then, you privately let others know what happened. It's OK to tell others about your lived experience. She was and is in the wrong here,  no doubt about it.", "This may not seem like a distinction to you, but it is: \n\nTell people the facts of what happened, objectively. Let them decide how to handle it. Don't issue blanket statements of how one person should treat another -- because if things blow up, it does end up on your shoulders, as you learned. \n\nYou slammed her publicly, telling people to essentially ostracize her in all the public spaces you found. She's slamming you back, right or wrong. That can't be surprising. (and yes, her actions to your child made her an AH).", "ESH. I can't fathom not giving everyone who shows up at my door candy. Costume or not, child, teen, or adult, speak or not. If you come to my door on October 31st, you can have whatever king sized candy bar you want. On the flip side, you doxxed this woman???? Do you not realize that is a crime? Yes, that was very wrong and you better hope she doesn't get hurt.", "NTA\n\nWho the fuck refuses to give candy to a child on Halloween? Much less a non-verbal kid? \n\nShe's just mad that you spoke the truth about her shitty actions", "NTA she was being an asshole to your daughter. I guess she believes people with disabilities cant go trick or treating? I think people deserve to know how your daughter was treated.", "i remember a house where i must have been a straggler cause she thought she was done for the night so she gave away all her candy.i showed up and she was like i have no candy-heres 5 dollars.i was stocked..", "Exactly. Don't want to be exposed for being an abelist ah? Simple,  just don't be one", "I wasn't worried about the woman's \"hurty feelings.\" I was worried about the undercurrent of anger in this country that might have escalated to someone assaulting or even killing the woman. I'm assuming this is in the US, and the US is a dangerous and violent country. People here quickly get out of hand, like the story the other day about the man and his son killed by a neighbor over a noise complaint. I felt she had been shamed, by the kids giving their bags of candy back.", "I don't necessarily think it was a revenge thing.  I think a fair warning about an experience like this might have helpful to other parents. I think if it were OP posting it all over Nextdoor or their Facebook page, I would agree it was likely just for revenge. But sharing it to just the parents in 1 of her 5 kids classes, not even all of the parents in all of their classes, is acceptable and was likely welcomed by the parents.", "I'm leaning towards that myself because of the general Ed.  Just messaged the parents with ND or non verbal kids would have been enough, and I might have said \"go with your kids to the door, or skip that house if you think it might be an issue.\n\nThe lady giving out candy was terrible for sure, but blasting her address to everyone is toeing the line.", "And how many kids would have left her house in tears if she hadn't let them know? Kids over assholes any day!", "If op had not shared it I fail to see how the neighbor would\u2019ve learned anything, unless this neighborhood has an unusually high population of non-verbal children she was likely the only one to get this kind of treatment, nobody else would\u2019ve been aware\n\nWhile I don\u2019t think the neighbor should be shamed forever you\u2019re certainly making a lot of assumptions. If people above the age of 17 are sending death threats through fucking nextdoor the offender probably did a lot worse than be ableism", "That\u2019s exactly what OP says they did\u2026 \u201cI texted a group chat\u2026 gave them the address, and explained what happened so they wouldn\u2019t have to deal with that with their kids.\u201d", "my kid's disabled. she did the best she could last night, but after a few houses, she couldn't walk anymore and so she say in the car with the door open and her best friend got candy for her at all the houses. if a house had refused her because she didn't participate the \"right\" way because she CANT I absolutely would have started shit. imagine treating little kids like dogs because they cant do the stuff you expect of them when all they want is to participate and theyre trying their best. \n\nno one picks to be disabled. people that are cruel to disabled children deserve to be ostracized."]}
