My friends are split, so internet strangers please levy a ruling.\n\nMy (F28) mom passed 4 years ago. This was the single most soul crushing thing to ever happen to me. She was my entire world, the most kind and extraordinarily intelligent woman I have ever known. She was an engineer, and an incredible one at that, she worked on many famous projects over the years. I followed in her footsteps and I like to think that every accomplishment of hers made the field a little more open to women and set the foundation that allowed me to get where I am today.\n\nFor those of you unaware, engineers will often wear a iron or stainless steel ring on their pinkie, the idea being that everything you work on touches this ring. I have one as did my mom. When she passed she left me hers and ever since I\u2019ve worn it on a necklace and give it a little tap on things I\u2019m working on too. Its silly little ritual but it makes me feel like shes with me and we\u2019re working things together.\n\nI met my partner (M35) three years ago in August. I told him coming up to Valentines day that year that if he\u2019s getting me a gift it cant be a necklace because of my necklace with my moms ring. I explained to him how if he did get it I wouldn\u2019t end up wearing it and I\u2019d feel guilty. I told him this prior to birthdays, christmas etc for the first year or so of us being together.\n\nThis year on our anniversary he tells me that he got a bonus at work and he got me a special gift. Its a necklace and an expensive one at that, gold with a diamond pendant. I thank him and put it on. I felt guilty knowing I wont end up wearing it enough to warrant the price tag but I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings. He pointed out that the gold clashes with the silver of my necklace and told me to take it off. I haven\u2019t taken off this necklace more than 3 times since I put the ring on it a few days after the funeral. I shower in this necklace, sleep in this necklace, the only times i\u2019ve taken it off have been TSA. I told him no and he keeps insisting and I admittedly got a bit emotional. I took off the necklace he got me and gave it back to him and told him to keep it. He rolled his eyes and told me I ruined the evening and stormed off.\n\nI paid the check and followed him out. In the car he yelled at me over how I \u201cneed to move on\u201d and told me its unhealthy how attached I am to the necklace. Maybe I\u2019m using it as a crutch, I don\u2019t know.", "created_utc": 1693848671, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169y8io/aita_for_not_wearing_the_necklace_my_partner/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn\u2019t take off my own and when he pressured me I gave him back the one he got me and told him I didn\u2019t want it.\n\nIn retrospect maybe I should\u2019ve placated him and took off the necklace for the evening at least. I get very emotional over my mom and may have acted irrationally. My friends are 50/50. Some of them say that I was being stubborn by not just taking it off at least for our anniversary\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But your partner absolutely is. You were very clear with them from the start about the importance of your necklace and it is baffling to me why he decided to go ahead and get you the one gift that you told him you wouldn\u2019t wear. \n\nNot only does this show disrespect to you, but it shows he doesn\u2019t understand or want to understand how important your mums ring is to you. \n\nFrom your description of how you use the necklace it sounds like you are doing so to stay connected to your mum. Has your partner ever voiced any thoughts about your attachment or grief regarding your mum in the past?", "Nta it's sentimental and you've already explained this to him. It's not about needing to \"move on.\"", "NTA\n\nWhere I come from people are allowed to decide themselves what to wear and what not...\n\nIt is unhealthy to gift somebody something they don't want and demand that they use it.", "NTA\n\nYou've made it clear that this is one necklace you'll always wear. Your partner seems to be fixated in getting you to remove it, and if you won't he'll create drama. It seems more like an ego thing than anything else.", "NTA. The key factor here is that you prev told him you didn't want a necklace. And so he gives you a necklace. That makes him the AH because he disregarded what you've told him. And if you've been w/yr partner for 3 years, he knows you keep yr necklace on all the time.\n\nHe had no right to yell at you like that.\n\nIf you want to wear the necklace, wear it. It's not up to other people to tell you to move on. When my father died, I felt I would never want to celebrate Christmas again. I didn't send cards, I didn't decorate the house. I thought it was over. Then one year I decided I wanted to again. I didn't \"make\" myself do it, I just felt like doing it again. \n\nI'm not suggesting that this means one day you'll want to take off the necklace. Just that your feelings about it will change over time, and the change happens in its own time. Four years is still pretty recent, esp if you were close. It can still hurt. I find it hurts less in time, but it takes time, and you never stop thinking about them. I think about my parents (both of whom are gone) every day.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur bf is an AH. For THIS \"He pointed out that the gold clashes with the silver of my necklace and told me to take it off. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"yelled at me over how I \u201cneed to move on\u201d \" .. He is right: You need to move on: End the relationship.", "You are absolutely NTA. You don\u2019t \u201cjust get over\u201d losing a parent. That\u2019s an ahole thing for your partner to say. And how idiotic for him to buy you the one thing you tell him not to??? He could\u2019ve bought a bracelet, earrings, anklet, anything else. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to get you to choose him over your mom. That\u2019s just gross.", "Ah so he wants to control you, esp something that you placed as a boundary.\n\nNTA and he's not a good partner.", "NTA your partner is disrespectful & emotionally controlling. He deliberately chose something he knew would cause you distress & is giving you shit about it. He isn\u2019t a good person. I\u2019d move on.", "NTA I feel like he did this on purpose to test you and \u201cwin\u201d over the sentiment of your existing necklace. I don\u2019t like people who do things like this when they\u2019ve been asked not to and given an explanation of why.  He could have gotten earrings, a bracelet, a ring - he picked this on purpose or he just didn\u2019t remember/care.", "NTA\n\nWithout getting extremely emotional and ranting,  I can't really express how mad I am at him for this.  The disrespect is so multilayered that I would barely know how to begin but that necklace is a deeply significant intersection of your emotional and professional lives and it's pretty disturbing that he thinks a pretty bauble should be more important.\n\nMake no mistake,  his buying you this necklace was not out of generosity or a desire to please you.  It was ego-driven.\n\nYou're not wrong on any level whatsoever.", "NTA. \nYour partner is too pushy about. He crossed a boundary (you told him no to necklaces and he got it anyway) and then he tried to be controlling and make you take off the one you wear in remembrance of your mom, and he he is trying to tell you how you should move on.  Sorry, but he is TA. \nIt\u2019s not unhealthy at all. He is just being weird about it.", "Your partner sounds like an insensitive AH. 4 years are not enough to just \"get over\" the passing of a beloved.\n\n\nHard NTA", "NTA. I can give you advice about moving on, and it involves dumping a lot of weight, say an adult male-sized amount.\n\nThis is something incredibly important to you, a non-negotiable. He knew this yet still disregarded your feelings and then had the temerity to tell you how *you* should feel. Eff him. There are tons of great guys out there who don't have their heads up their asses like your boyfriend.", "I inherited a beautiful watch from my mother, which has enormous sentimental value to me. I wear it every day. My husband has enough sense not to give me another watch, but if he did, it would be returned to the store that day.\n\nNTA. It almost seems like he was trying some kind of loyalty test\u2014the fact that you told him repeatedly necklaces were a no-fly zone and he got you one anyway, and then demanded you take off your mother\u2019s ring, makes it look like he viewed it as \u201cwho does she love more, her mother or me?\u201d Which is jealous and dumb, but there you are.", "This is gross behaviour. He tried to control you and push your boundaries, you stood up for yourself and now he's playing the victim.  And now you're 2nd guessing yourself.    Telling you to move on from your mother's death should be a big sign to leave him.  NTA, but love yourself and leave him", "INFO:Why dont you wear both of them? I have several necklaces (5 or so) that i do not take off one also being a gift from my partner too and i just wear them all", "YTA\n\nI am a mechanical engineer. You never wear jewellery of any kind while working.\n\nI have seen a finger stripped down to the bone by a wedding ring when the wearer slipped and it caught it the job he was doing. He lost his finger.\n\n I have seen necklaces caught in machinery, a close friend of mine nearly died this way.\n\nLoose the jewellery at work, it is basic safety.", "NAH, but can't you have space in your life for more than one necklace? Did your mother wear only one ring? You can wear the gift he gave you on date nights or special occasions and wear the keepsake necklace to work where it has the most significance. You have room in your heart to love both your mother and your husband. Make room in your jewelry box, too.", "This ritual of intentionally dangling your necklace on whatever project you're working on sounds dangerous. Please stop your superstition.
