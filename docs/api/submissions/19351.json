My bf is originally from South America and the only close family he has in the U.S. are his aunt, uncle, and a couple cousins who he used to live with but then moved in with me 3 hours away from them. \n\n\nA couple of weeks ago his sister called and said she\u2019d be coming to America and staying with their aunt for about a month. My bf said he really wanted her to meet me and our son, plus we share one car so we had to figure out what weekend to drive out. We landed on the 10th (this weekend).\n\n\n\nBut to be honest the last couple of weeks we have been arguing quite a bit and he hasn\u2019t been helping me out around the house. I work a full time job but from home, so Im also the one that takes care of our son, cleans, etc. My bf is a PE teacher at a middle school and for the last two weeks, has been on summer break. So I have asked him to help out more at home but he has been partaking in the use of \u201cMary ju Wanna\u201d and not doing much else. \n\n\nUnfortunately yesterday I was in a car accident and even though I\u2019m fine, our car needs some minor work done. I was upset that my bf seemed to be more annoyed at the car being unavailable than concerned over the accident. He said he was sorry that happened to me, and glad I\u2019m safe but is now \n pestering me to rent a car tomorrow so we can still drive to his family\u2019s. Mind you, he spent the entire day lying in bed, only getting up for smoke breaks, while I worked and my sister came over to help watch my son.\n\n\nSo I finally told him no, I won\u2019t be renting a car and driving him down to his family\u2019s 3 hours each way because he has not contributed to our household at all the last week or so. He called me cold hearted because his sister will be going home before the end of June, and he promised her that we would drive her to places she wanted to visit and feels bad backing out. I didn\u2019t know he has signed us up to be her personal tour guide but I would have went along with it, had he even asked. It\u2019s nothing against his sister or their family. It has to do with him expecting me to go out of my way to accommodate him when he hasn\u2019t done his fair share of the responsibilities and money is tight already.

Just like you had to ask your sister for help, so can he find a friend to help him out now. Calling you cold hearted before apologizing, just shows he has no remorse that he left you alone with all the chores and does not see a problem with it at all. He needs to understand this is not normal behaviour in a relationship. Nor is making plans with his sister without consulting you. I mean, you do have a kid with you, arrangements have to be made well in advance and itineraries should be laid down and approved by everyone.

No. Should he do more and contribute to the household chores and childrearing? Absolutely. Is it related to meeting his sister? Absolutely not. Address your hurt feelings. Flat out tell him he needs to do more around the house and with his son.
