{"id": 27494, "submission_id": "16qaw99", "title": "AITA for trying to stop what I thought was a prank at my friend\u2019s wedding?", "selftext": "My friend, Ashley, got married last night to her longtime partner, Kevin. Kevin\u2019s best friend, Frank. he\u2019s a bit of a prankster and it\u2019s usually all in good fun. Ashley has shared there are times that Frank goes a little too far to stir the pot but he had promised to be on his best behavior for the wedding.\n\nI had agreed to help deal with Ashley\u2019s boundary-stomping family as well as look out for any pranks that Frank might pull. Even though we knew he said he\u2019d be good, we know Frank.\n\nAshley and Kevin are big football fans. At one point in the night, they wanted the wedding party to don 49ers jerseys they purchased to get a few photos in. Frank is also a football fan, but is diehard for the Chiefs. There\u2019s always been some banter back and forth between Ashley and Frank over this. In the beginning, Ashley said he was refusing to wear the jersey she bought. Eventually, he gave in and said it was just 5 minutes, so no big deal. He did keep cracking jokes that he\u2019d show up in a Chiefs jersey and Ashley always said with a serious face \u201cYeah, no, don\u2019t you dare\u201d. So, I was to assume that hey, he\u2019s not wearing it.\n\nThe time came for the wedding party to put on our jerseys over our dresses/suits. The wedding party went upstair. As I\u2019m waiting with the other bridesmaids, I see Frank come out of the bathroom in a Chiefs jersey. I asked what he was doing. He smirked and said it was all good. I told him to go change. Again, he repeated it was all good and he had permission. Considering Ashley hadn\u2019t told me and it wouldn\u2019t be out of Frank\u2019s wheelhouse to try to pull one over on me, I said \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t. Why are you trying to cause problems on her wedding day?\u201d. That\u2019s when Kevin came out of the room he and Ashley were getting ready in and asked what was going on. Frank said \u201cShe doesn\u2019t believe me\u201d. Kevin seemed to have a lightening bulb moment and was like \u201cOh, yeah, we meant to tell you that Ashley agreed it was fine for him to wear the jersey, they have some cool poses planned\u201d.\n\nI said alright, apologized to Frank for the misunderstanding and moved on. I think the pictures will turn out great. After Kevin and Ashley left, I stayed behind to help clean up some stuff. Frank approached me and said I was a drama queen for making a big deal about the jersey. I said I had no clue Ashley gave him permission and given his history of antagonizing people/playing pranks, I thought it was a fair assumption. He said it was none of my business. I pointed out that I had been put in charge of making sure he didn\u2019t pull any pranks, which he knew. Still, he told me that I should\u2019ve \u201cminded my own business\u201d.\n\nWe haven\u2019t bothered Ashley and Kevin with this and I have no plans to. However, it got around some of our friends and they\u2019re split. Some say I was in the right given Frank\u2019s past. Others say I was being controlling and dramatic.
