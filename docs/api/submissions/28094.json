Some people really don\u2019t do good on their own and have never been single more than a day of their life because being alone terrifies them. Perhaps he really means it that he had no intention of it going anywhere \u2014 unless, of course, things ended with you for real, in which case he had a \u201cplan B.\u201d I don\u2019t think either of you are an asshole to be honest.

It\u2019s not healthy for either of you. Shit or get off the pot, as they say. Dive in, or peace out. Edit: also, he probably lied about the strip club because he\u2019s ashamed to admit it. Whether you have a problem with it or not, he probably fears rejection and thinks you\u2019ll see him as being pathetic and gross. That kind of fear, whether real or imagined, feels real enough in the moment to even be able to tell the difference for most of us.

I know what Fetlife is...and yeah if he's on there chatting with another woman, that's definitely a sign that he's either cheating or plans to. Unless you both are on there and go to kink events and such, or have friends from there, I would absolutely be sleeping separately and making plans to leave.
