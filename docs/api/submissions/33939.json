I have a dairy allergy which means I can't eat butter, milk, yoghurt or cheese.  Everyone in the family knows this, especially my mother in law who is in charge of cooking.  First two nights for dinner we had raclette ( if you don't what that is, its basically you chop up your own vegetables and fry them on a little stand, then you add cheese which you then grill on the same stand).  - raclette is literally just fried chopped vegetables and potatoes unless you have the cheese, and further more it takes about an hour to grill enough to feel full.  Ok though, I made it through that, I just had extra nuts and chocolate, its christmas after all.\n\nSo on day 3 we were to have a more substantial meal with mash potato, except MiL forgot me and put butter and milk in, and instead of telling me and saying sorry assigned this guy (Wife's sister's partner) who is known as extremely unreliable, depressed, (who also happened to be very ill and not someone you'd want makng your food at all) to make a dairy free mash.  He boiled some potatoes and blended them, making a watery potato-only soup consistency broth, and this was served on the table in a saucepan with the rest of the meal that I could have.  I asked for a bowl and poured out a portion of the potatoes, and then offered it round to others.  No-one wanted any, including the guy who made it, and this was the point in which I just had enough, and got serious angry (inside).\n\nSo I made an excuse about having promised to call my Mum and picked up the remaining meal and  bowl of watery potatoes and left to another room where I called my Mum, and I poured it down the toilet and just ate bread until I was full.\n\nWife came in absolutely fuming telling me I'd hurt the guy's feelings, and that it was so rude to leave the dinner table. I laid my cards on the table, why have I not been thought of for every single meal, I'm never asked what I want, and its not hard to make things dairy free, or to buy some extra stuff etc etc. Wife says I should just suck it up, and that the guy made an effort.  I replied that he is not a kid, if I made something that atrocious I would not expect anyone to eat it like he was a child whose feelings I shouldn't hurt.  I'm now in the dog house, apparently no-one bought my needing to call my Mum story. AITA here?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention they all barely speak English, as we are in France, my wife is half French.  This goes some of the way perhaps to me not being involved in meal discussions.\n\nEDIT 2: It's not really possible for me to cook my own food in this situation, its hard to explain but MiL and that side of the family are the cooks, and we don't really get input, and we offer to help and are turned down.  \nEDIT 3: MiL has known me for 5 years, and knows about the intolerance.  She is just forgetting me, which is ok, it happens.  I basically got mad because they served me something basically inedible, and acted like nothing was wrong rather than just saying sorry and getting me bread.", "created_utc": 1703797265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t4f58/aita_for_excusing_myself_from_family_dinner_after/", "score": 441, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was coming to ask this)\n\nu/BrerCamel, can you take a pill?\n\n\n(For those who don\u2019t know: dairy intolerant is allergic to the sugars in dairy. They can usually take a pill for it.

I explained that the watery potatoes were made without my input!", "They say it's an allergy.\n\nI'm just intolerant, and that's bad enough! Have you ever cried on the toilet? I have! But dairy is *delicious*", "Ok - but In this situation I had no option of purchasing dairy free options, offering to help in the kitchen.  I could have just eat the bread later, but I also didnt want to offend the guy by not eating the watery potatoes, whence the leaving with the meal to have pretended to eat it.", "I didn't say leave the room. And an entire meal was served, not just mashed potatoes. You dumped an entire meal because you were upset that the potatoes were not to your standard.

My boyfriend\u2019s family lives far away enough that we prefer to stay there at least a couple of days. I absolutely had to bring my own food, there was no way I was putting that on my boyfriend\u2019s mom. I bought a travel cooler and premade all my meals to bring with me.

For an extended stay, there will be times when it might be challenging to plan a meal that works for everyone. In this case, the MIL is AH for giving two raclette dinners. I agree with that.

Which would be a perfectly suitable meal.", "That\u2019s their point. Even with extensive intolerances of their own and problem foods it\u2019s second nature to avoid, they find it easy to make mistakes with staple ingredients they\u2019re not as accustomed to navigating around. (Though to their credit, it also sounds like they probably catch the mistake and correct it.)\n\nWhich does make sense to me, to a degree. My only issue is that it\u2019s not something they seem to be trying to avoid or course correct *at all*. It\u2019s not as though they\u2019re starting the dish with butter and then saying \u201coh shit\u201d and starting over with oil; they\u2019re either serving components they know OP can\u2019t eat half of, or they\u2019re serving something that none of them is willing to even taste.\n\nAll of that said, NTA for me.

There was no meat and veg?  You sound exhausting and a terrible guest. YTA", "No I didn't dump the entire meal, and I didn't ask for or require anything expensive.  Simple boiled potatoes would have sufficed.  I would have gladly prepared them myself if asked, this was all done without me knowing!", "Sounds like he was pretending to eat the watery potatoes that he didn't want. It's harder to pretend to eat food when people are looking at you. Either way, it didn't work.", "Mash was the main carb.

You just sulked in your room like a toddler because the potatoes weren't up to your standards? I can die from eating sugar and yet my in-laws never serve diet drinks. Do you know what I do?
