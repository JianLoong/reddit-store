{"id": 33939, "submission_id": "18t4f58", "title": "AITA For excusing myself from family dinner after being served a visibly disgusting dairy free alternative", "selftext": "I (m39) am on a Christmas holiday with Wife's (f36) family.  I have a dairy allergy which means I can't eat butter, milk, yoghurt or cheese.  Everyone in the family knows this, especially my mother in law who is in charge of cooking.  First two nights for dinner we had raclette ( if you don't what that is, its basically you chop up your own vegetables and fry them on a little stand, then you add cheese which you then grill on the same stand).  - raclette is literally just fried chopped vegetables and potatoes unless you have the cheese, and further more it takes about an hour to grill enough to feel full.  Ok though, I made it through that, I just had extra nuts and chocolate, its christmas after all.\n\nSo on day 3 we were to have a more substantial meal with mash potato, except MiL forgot me and put butter and milk in, and instead of telling me and saying sorry assigned this guy (Wife's sister's partner) who is known as extremely unreliable, depressed, (who also happened to be very ill and not someone you'd want makng your food at all) to make a dairy free mash.  He boiled some potatoes and blended them, making a watery potato-only soup consistency broth, and this was served on the table in a saucepan with the rest of the meal that I could have.  I asked for a bowl and poured out a portion of the potatoes, and then offered it round to others.  No-one wanted any, including the guy who made it, and this was the point in which I just had enough, and got serious angry (inside).\n\nSo I made an excuse about having promised to call my Mum and picked up the remaining meal and  bowl of watery potatoes and left to another room where I called my Mum, and I poured it down the toilet and just ate bread until I was full.\n\nWife came in absolutely fuming telling me I'd hurt the guy's feelings, and that it was so rude to leave the dinner table. I laid my cards on the table, why have I not been thought of for every single meal, I'm never asked what I want, and its not hard to make things dairy free, or to buy some extra stuff etc etc. Wife says I should just suck it up, and that the guy made an effort.  I replied that he is not a kid, if I made something that atrocious I would not expect anyone to eat it like he was a child whose feelings I shouldn't hurt.  I'm now in the dog house, apparently no-one bought my needing to call my Mum story. AITA here?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention they all barely speak English, as we are in France, my wife is half French.  This goes some of the way perhaps to me not being involved in meal discussions.\n\nEDIT 2: It's not really possible for me to cook my own food in this situation, its hard to explain but MiL and that side of the family are the cooks, and we don't really get input, and we offer to help and are turned down.  \nEDIT 3: MiL has known me for 5 years, and knows about the intolerance.  She is just forgetting me, which is ok, it happens.  I basically got mad because they served me something basically inedible, and acted like nothing was wrong rather than just saying sorry and getting me bread.\n\nEDIT 4: A lot of people want to know what else there was. We had a portion of fried pork, and there was a saucepan of cabbage. No bread, so without the potatoes the meal was just pork and cabbage.\n\nEDIT 5: it\u2019s a cows milk intolerance meaning lactaid doesn\u2019t work. \n \nEDIT 6: Lots of people are still saying I should fix my own meals or go to the shops and get my own supplies. This is not really a polite thing in this situation otherwise I would 100pc do that. You have to trust me on this one that it was not an option and that more offense would be caused if I offered to do that.\n\nReading the balance it\u2019s quite a mixture. I think I handled the situation poorly, but I don\u2019t know what the correct plan of action would be without having to a) publicly reject eating it this offending MiL and the other guy or b) pretend to like it and potentially be forced to eat an entire pan of it. I would have taken b if potentially any of the others at the table had decided to try it, but it just felt humiliating as everyone could see how bad it was and it would be obvious that I was faking enjoyment.  I think if I had better social skills I could have maybe joked my way through perhaps\u2026 perhaps it wouldn\u2019t have been humiliating to fake enjoyment and I could have just raised my eyebrows at everyone to let them know I was just being polite.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1703797265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t4f58/aita_for_excusing_myself_from_family_dinner_after/", "score": 1579, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs a wakeup call to treat you with more care and respect.", "NTA. It\u2019s sheer laziness and disrespect. You can have mashed potatoes made with margarine or spread instead of butter.

Soy milk and vegan \"butter\" and you'd never know it wasn't the real deal.\n\nFor whatever reason, they're not willing to put the effort in to feed you. They might not believe in intolerances/allergies, or they might not case enough about you to go to any effort. Either way, there's no reason you should have to put up with it.\n\nYour wife should talk to her mother and find out what the core issue is - tell her it would be easier for you to be polite about it if you understood properly, and see if she can find out what's really going on. Then you can decide how you feel about their reasons, and decide whether they're people you're willing to spend time with.\n\nAs a side note, learning as much French as you can will help you immensely in your ongoing interactions with her family.

Most of the people I know who are only lactose intolerant also don't use lactaid pills because they are very unreliable.", "At least you can have pink ones! Pink peppercorns are cashews, not peppercorns, so you can eat them!\n\nI\u2019m really sorry about the pepper though. That sounds AWFUL, NGL. It must be impossible to eat out, because what kitchen is prepared for \u201cno pepper\u201d? And unusual enough that it\u2019s probably a struggle to convince people to take it seriously.

The more I read, the more it appears that it isn't a case where the meal wasn't cooked with them in mind. They just also made mashed potatoes, which OP can't eat, so scrambled to give an alternative. They say right in the post the bad alternative potatoes were served with other dishes they could eat. So why not just skip the potatoes?\n\nIf I had a problem with dairy and knew mac n cheese was my wife's favorite dish cooked by her mom I wouldn't freak out and say don't cook it. I would just eat the other stuff.

The classic, Swiss cheese fondue is the original, and perhaps the most well-known, but there's more kinds as well, all of which are called fondue; chocolate fondue, oil fondue, etc. Both cheese fondue and oil fondue (and probably more kinds) are Swiss, and the term \"fondue\" has been used as an umbrella term for all of them since the 50's. \n\nI've only had the oil kind, myself, and have always heard it referred to as just \"fondue\" - where little chunks of beef are dipped in hot oil.

Finding nothing.", "If he didnt think it was a woman\u2019s job, then he\u2019d be happy to help.", "\"the rest of the meal that I could have\" is where I got the idea there was other food.  He could have come back to the table with the bread as his main carb, or just sat and enjoyed the company of people at the table.  I've done that so, so many times, but then I'd be really embarrassed to learn my food issues had made anyone else uncomfortable on a social or family occasion.  It's my body and my problem and I handle it.  We also don't know if the others could hear him talking on the phone to his mom, and it sounds as though there's been lots of discussion of him wanting to take over MIL's kitchen during the holidays, which some people can't handle.  And given how he talks about other people, and that he's had five years to learn French and hasn't had the respect for his wife to do it, well, I kinda doubt that's the only reason his wife blew up, more like the straw that broke the camel's back.  And there were other meals besides the 2, or the 2 and 2/3 that he could eat, but anyway, enough.  I guess what upsets him and you wouldn't upset me and that, after all, is what makes Reddit run, right?  Hope you have lots of delicious holiday meals, and I'm not being sarcastic about it!", "I dunno.  Given the prissy and kinda mean way OP talks about his in-laws, I could believe it was done deliberately, because he's already on my nerves after 30 seconds of reading.  But since he says the cook is depressed, maybe it wasn't done deliberately.  Or then again, maybe he said all those mean things about the BIL to cover up the fact that OP has been such a mean little toddler for so long that BIL did it on purpose because OP got on his last nerve, too.  Eh, who knows?  It's Reddit.", "Why do you assume there was some dairy-free main apart from what she said? Where\u2019s your evidence for that?

I've never made anything fouler tasting.", "I think its the almond that caused it, theres a Chinese dessert sweet soup/drink, thats made with almond, and its usually served hot, and while it taste good, but the smell will make me lose my appetite, and sadly I made that mistake more than once...", "I have a friend who had to become vegan for medical reasons. I made her a lasagna exactly this way and she said it was amazing. I actually think unsweetened oat milk actually tastes better to me in the bechamel than real milk.", "Parmesan is not vegetarian, but it sounds delicious!", "Sets slightly better with fauxgurt instead of fauxmilk.  But if you store them in the freezer and eat them straight out the freezer, you a get a melty smoothness that is so oddly satisfying.", "I can assure you he doesn't get involved in his house either, only makes his wife meeting his standards.", "I have had friends with dairy allergies (hauled one to the ER once) and you may just not be able to trust that MIL won't make dairy-free food, especially if another culture and language barrier are involved. It's probably better if you bring your own food to eat or eat before going over to her house instead of trusting that she will remember/bother to try to make it safe for you so you can eat with everyone else. You need to take care of you, not trust that she will take care of you.", "Yeah I think people are being a little bit unrealistic about what this guy can maybe do here. His wife should be advocating much better for him - even if it is to advocate that he needs to be allowed in to the kitchen to prep his own portion of X alongside the main.

That would be a nightmare. \n\nIt\u2019s very likely MIL shops for all the food before they arrive and at any rate even if he did go shopping with them he wouldn\u2019t know what meal was being discussed anyway (yes ok he should learn French but he\u2019s going to be way off that level for a while). Plus MIL definitely will have decided upon these meals days if not weeks ago so that would have been the time to have input (I think he\u2019s British, if he had known about the raclette in advance he could have taken any one of the number of semi passable vegan cheeses with him) - but all of this is going to be going through his wife who seems much more concerned about not rocking the boat with her family than standing beside her husband. And as the person who is pretty often in that position with my in laws, and especially over something as important as food\u2026 it sucks!\n\nEdit: however ESH. You should have sucked it up and barely touched it as presumably it was just a side.
