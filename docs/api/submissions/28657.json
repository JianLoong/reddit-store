He workouts 5-7 days a week, and because of weightlifting, he has very big shoulders and arms. He works in sales and wears collared dress shirts to work. Every morning for months on end, he wants me to help him button his cuffs on his sleeves. His excuse originally for not being able to button them himself, was that he\u2019s too big to be able to do it. I called him out saying that I think that\u2019s just an excuse because when I haven\u2019t been home, he\u2019s able to button them by himself. Now he says it takes him way too long to button them himself so he wants me to do it because I am able to do it faster. \n\nMy issue with helping him button his cuffs are 1) I am not his mother and he\u2019s a grown man. And 2) I have a routine in the morning that I like to stick to. I drop off our son at school, then I go to the gym and then do grocery shopping or errands. He gets upset if I refuse to come home to help him button his cuffs after dropping off our son at school. The days that this is most frequently irritating to me are the days that I have off from work. I work 3-4 days a week, and I get 3 days off when our son is in school to focus on myself (going to the gym) and getting errands done. Having to drive all the way home after dropping off our son at school, cuts into some of my time that I can be getting other things done. \n\nAITA for refusing to help my husband button his cuffs on his dress shirt?

Does he have the fine motor control of a toddler?", "If you\u2019re able bodied and able to weight lift almost every day of the week to the point where your muscle mass is significant enough to cause some sort of hindrance in your life, then you have no excuses for finding things like this difficult.

That's a significant interruption which shows that he feels it's better she lose half an hour of her time (that's a conservative guess) so he doesn't \"have\" to deal with doing something difficult (dressing himself) for 2 minutes. \n\nIt shows a complete lack of respect for her.  She's not a body servant, she is a whole person with stuff to do as well.", "It's not the 5 seconds of help if she happens to be home. It's expecting her to *drive back home* to do something he *is* capable of doing, it just takes him longer, that is the weaponized incompetence.", "Hi! I sew clothing and that\u2019s not true if a tailor is telling you that then you do need to see a more experienced tailor.
