He workouts 5-7 days a week, and because of weightlifting, he has very big shoulders and arms. He works in sales and wears collared dress shirts to work. Every morning for months on end, he wants me to help him button his cuffs on his sleeves. His excuse originally for not being able to button them himself, was that he\u2019s too big to be able to do it. I called him out saying that I think that\u2019s just an excuse because when I haven\u2019t been home, he\u2019s able to button them by himself. Now he says it takes him way too long to button them himself so he wants me to do it because I am able to do it faster. \n\nMy issue with helping him button his cuffs are 1) I am not his mother and he\u2019s a grown man. And 2) I have a routine in the morning that I like to stick to. I drop off our son at school, then I go to the gym and then do grocery shopping or errands. He gets upset if I refuse to come home to help him button his cuffs after dropping off our son at school. The days that this is most frequently irritating to me are the days that I have off from work. I work 3-4 days a week, and I get 3 days off when our son is in school to focus on myself (going to the gym) and getting errands done. Having to drive all the way home after dropping off our son at school, cuts into some of my time that I can be getting other things done. \n\nAITA for refusing to help my husband button his cuffs on his dress shirt?

I'm sure if they both stopped fighting and instead considered it to be more of a couple's ritual, they could both adjust their schedules to make it doable. At the very least, they could work together to find a solution like magnetic buttons.", "Yah I thought they were dressing together and she wouldn\u2019t do it and I thought \u201cwell, kind of harsh but I guess I get it, sorta\u201d \u2026.. and then I find out she \u2026\u2026 would need to come home to button him up \ud83d\udc40\n\nIf u can\u2019t button up your shirt I guess it\u2019s turtleneck time.", "Not to mention he could leave early and drive to see her at her work place!\n\nNTA\n\nOP should buy him cufflinks for Christmas.", "Me too, I was like that is something I wouldn't mind doing if I was right there for my boo.  But imagine how much gas and driving time she has devoted to his buttons!  Crazy!", "Ever think it has nothing to do with buttons rather it is about an excuse to ask his wife for a little time before he goes to work? Maybe he has some bullshit he knows is going to ge unpleasant and a few minutes with his sweety is what he needs to get through the day", "Ask a co-worker, that's a nice touch.", "If the drive itself is no biggie, he could always drive to her!   I love the image of him pulling up to the gym and asking for help with his buttons lol!", "\"If you need any help with your buttons once you get to kindy, the teacher will help you.\" \n\nAnother option is that he gets dressed in time to drive the son to school on his way to work, so OP can button his cuffs for him, have another cup of tea, and then get an early start on her chores.", "The scream I scrumpt", "Hell, take his shirts to a seamstrss and have them sew on velcro patches to do the job the buttons usually do. And considering his manly girth, consider velcro closing fancy shoes for Christmas... so he doesn't have to bend over so long.", "Yeah, she can stuff it up his bum!", "My thoughts exactly. I was going \"wait, you can't stop what your doing to turn around for 2 seconds and help hubby before going back to making breakfast or whatever it is your doing.\" \n\nThen OP said that she isn't even in the house when he is getting dressed and I start thinking, \"ok yeah no, if he wants you to drop the kid off at school, come home and help him get dressed then go back out and run your errands, he either needs to stop.working out so much (and hopefully shrink his muscles a little), buy bigger shirts, get dressed before you leave or grow up and dress himself without complaint.\"\n\nOh, and just so we are clear, I'm team grow up and do ot yourself.", "Yes!!! I was  thinking the same thing; if you\u2019re getting ready together, it\u2019s an odd request for a grown able-bodied man, but if you\u2019re right next to him, it only takes a minute or two. Expecting her to drive home just to button is ridiculous! NTA", "But who will roll down the neck for him?", "This was what I first pictured too!", "i can't imagine being attracted to this man after this. not in a withholding sex way, just genuinely not attracted. like you need me to drive home just to dress you??? are you five??? am i your mom now??", "This is such a tiny request, and I wish  my husband was still here so I could button his cuffs anytime he asked.  It's always the little things we miss the most.  \ud83e\udd9c", "I don't think it's odd if they're both getting ready! It's like if I ask my husband to hook a bracelet for me. Yeah I can do it but it's a pain in the ass, he can get it done in 5 seconds.\n\nBut neither one of us would ever expect the other to come home for something like this! Lol", "I\u2019d be happy to. He should hop on the plane and take an Uber to my place.", "I agree the demands are the problem. Which is why the second paragraph was:\n\n>The problem is the demanding. And especially the demanding to come home while out doing errands for it. That's crazytownfrollicks.", "... yeah, we know, did you not bother to read the comment that you're replying to?", "It would be a tiny request if she was in the same zip code as him lmao", "Yeah the request for help isn't the issue here it's the fact that he is insisting on her having to come home JUST TO BUTTON UP HIS CUFFS then leave again and go do her errands. It's the needless return home that makes him an AH here.", "Yep, same here. Might be a pain if it\u2019s an every day thing, but I wouldn\u2019t mind if we\u2019re getting ready together. \n\nNope, not driving home to button for you, through. Love you, but not gonna happen. Lol"]}
