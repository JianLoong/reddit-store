As a victim of a drunk driver myself, and having had to deal with friends being victims of SA while drunk, I think it should be obvious to everyone that *you do not abandon a drunk person in a public restaurant* if you've made yourself their DD.

It's much too complex of an issue to go into in a single Reddit comment, but many states have imposed strict rules about teaching race in the classroom and important courses that could give more perspective are being banned or vetoed. The far right is claiming that schools are trying to indoctrinate children with a political agenda, blah, blah...but if you actually read the laws they have passed and read about the courses and books that have been banned, it's pretty clear this is an attempt to ban discussions of race in the classroom outside an unnuanced \"slavery was bad\" (but not that bad because making it sound too bad is Propaganda /s). \n\nThe mom's position about school education very much *is* actively promoting racism through the erasure of black literature and history in the classroom, as well the vetoing of courses focused on black studies.", "Wow, I had no idea that any of that was happening as I'm not American or in America.
