Does she think the animals being locked up in tiny cages in a mass production farm is more ethical? She eats meat. Does she think it's lab grown? I grew up with chickens. Yes, it sucked when they had to be sacrificed due to age or illness, or purely because they were aggressive to the flock or cannibalistic (chickens can be horrible) but I knew the chickens were eventually going to end up as that for x y or z reason. I hate people who consider it barbaric, infinite times more if they are hypocritical enough to consume animal produce.", "NTA. You told her not to get attached.", "Easy NTA.", "NTA You warned your gf she disregarded it. Does she eat chicken? If she does then she's just as \"barbaric\" as grandma is.

As cruel as it may seem, the hen can no longer lay eggs, and therefore is a burden if you live a rural lifestyle as you are providing for it, while getting nothing in return.\n\nThis is the way of life, that many people followed and continue to follow.

A bundle from a stork?", "I'm not sure this is the apocalypse partner for you. NTA. You can't love life of you don't respect death.

I also think she's the AH to tell you that your family is \"barbaric\". It's literally how nature works has she ever watched an animal documentary where a lion eats it's prey, it's the circle of life.

She should've listened to your advice on this one. \n\nShe needs to understand the reality of where her food comes from, assuming she's not vegan. It was definitely an AH move for her to accuse you and your family of barbarism. How in the hell does she think this happens?

To be honest a lot more people need to see this. The meat products we get in supermarkets and from butchers removes the whole killing aspect from eating meat. People need to be aware that what they are eating was once a living and breathing creature, and that it has lost its life for you to be able to eat. That's why a lot of cultures have traditions for giving thanks at a meal, not just to the cook who prepared it, but also to the sacrifices that were made to allow us to eat.\n\nIt's not unnatural either. Any predator has to kill to eat, and they know that. We just decided that it would be better if only a small portion of people actually dealt with it. Most of these animals are given full lives (as I can assume this older hen had) where they go through very few hardships.

Culling your animals is part of that job and lifestyle of homesteading, living off the land and such. I assume your grandma sees them as a food source, which is totally legit. Yes chickens can be very lovely pets that provide eggs and even emotional support, but your gf went into this KNOWING theyre not considered pets and that they will be culled to provide food. Your gf is TA for assuming that just because she likes a certain chicken (that isnt even hers to start with) would be excluded from the list of possible hens that would be killed to feed you and your family. And the hen that was picked makes even more sense because she was old and couldnt provide eggs anymore, which for me wouldnt be a problem as i love mine so much i will continue to provide for them until they die. But for those that have lived that life for so long it only makes sense to cull and make her into a nice roast dinner. This strikes me as typical city folk being shocked that farm life can be \"cruel\" by their standards.
