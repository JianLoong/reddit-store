Yes, it sucked when they had to be sacrificed due to age or illness, or purely because they were aggressive to the flock or cannibalistic (chickens can be horrible) but I knew the chickens were eventually going to end up as that for x y or z reason.

She\u2019s awful for calling your grandmother\u2019s life barbaric.", "NTA- You said in other comments that she also ate chicken before and then she has the audacity to call your grandmas lifestyle barbaric. She's definitely a hypocrite there.", "NTA\n\nGrew up with sustenance hunters & trappers and learned from a young age where my food came from.\n\nThe ignorant that are so far removed from reality have no idea what it\u2019s like to for some people to just live life.\n\nDitch her, she\u2019s not worth the drama", "Sounds like youre about to be single lol. As you should be with her disrespecting your gma. Leave her and dont look back", "Killing chickens is the most normal thing I can think of. And you warned her. Nta", "NTA - the way your grandma is raising livestock is quite literally more humane than the mass factories we have in most places. I\u2019ll always support local and buy local for this reason, plus those weren\u2019t your GF\u2019s chickens.\n\nAlso, upon further reflection this is exactly why food education is so important. I spent the first few years of my life on a farm. I know exactly why OP and his grandma is going \u201cwtf\u201d at this city girl who seems to assume meat pops up out of nowhere. Chickens are animals that could be pets, but they\u2019re also livestock. They deserve to be treated humanely while alive, but there is nothing immoral about eating them, tis\u2019 the natural cycle of life.", "Ooof. NTA. Your GF is being the AH in this case for being incredibly rude to you, your grandmother, and your culture. Also, you told her the chicken wasn't a pet and in treating it like one, she ignored your values and the chicken's purpose on the farm.", "Funny thing how the hen became \"hers\"", "NTA. I don\u2019t see how she can complain unless she is a vegan. The way your grandma raises chickens it\u2019s a lot more humane than industrial chicken factories; also much healthier.", "Ah I remember learning this hard lesson. Don\u2019t name the pigs. Well I named one of the pigs Isabel, shine on you crazy diamond. To be fair I was 7 at the time, and I did still eat Isabel once I stopped crying. If you can\u2019t stomach the fact your food died to feed you, I have some vegan recipes. She was warned. Barbaric culture haha like yours my Isabel was one of my grandmas pigs and in contrast to other farming methods she had a good life. I\u2019ve seen factory farming. Now that is barbaric. People think their rotisserie chickens are what? Materialised out of thin air. Obviously NTA", "NTA your girlfriend needs to calm down. Where does she think her chicken in the store comes from?", "NTA - I personally don't think I could kill a chicken because I am a softy but I respect the trade and enjoy eating meat. I think it was naive of your girlfriend to pick one as a \"pet\". It's not like she was taking it home and keeping it. It's a chicken on a farm and you warned her that this would happen. I also think she's the AH to tell you that your family is \"barbaric\". It's literally how nature works has she ever watched an animal documentary where a lion eats it's prey, it's the circle of life. It is alot less cruel to give them a good life and wait until there old then to just mass produce them in tiny cages for slaughter which is what she eats on the regular. Your girlfriend needs a reality check on how meat eating works. You don't call your food a \"pet\" and I blame her for getting attached thinking they were going to live happily ever after on the farm when they are ment for either laying eggs or eating.", "NTA. I personally could never slaughter an animal even though I eat meat. I think it's very noble that the birds are being used for their intended purpose and I think very respectfully of people who do this. \n\nYour girlfriend doesn't sound like she's ever had to deal with animals being slaughtered for food and it's probably shocked her, especially since she got kind of attached to one of the hens there. She should've listened to your advice on this one. \n\nShe needs to understand the reality of where her food comes from, assuming she's not vegan. It was definitely an AH move for her to accuse you and your family of barbarism. How in the hell does she think this happens? If she wants a real horror story, she should see what happens to animals in commercial farms and slaughter houses. At least the animals in your family farm get to enjoy their lives.", "NTA. You gave fair warning.", "NTA, the chicken was never \"her pet\" and she should leave to the city by herself, seeing she's such an hypocrite and rude to your grandma and your family.", "NTA. Why should grandma cull a bird that is still laying, to spare one that no longer is, especially if there is not going to be enough food to feed them all? It\u2019s not cruel or barbaric, its farm logic. Eat it while it still can be useful as food.", "YTA. \n\nDidn\u2019t think it was a good idea to warn her ahead of the killing?", "NTA. To be honest a lot more people need to see this. The meat products we get in supermarkets and from butchers removes the whole killing aspect from eating meat. People need to be aware that what they are eating was once a living and breathing creature, and that it has lost its life for you to be able to eat. That's why a lot of cultures have traditions for giving thanks at a meal, not just to the cook who prepared it, but also to the sacrifices that were made to allow us to eat.\n\nIt's not unnatural either. Any predator has to kill to eat, and they know that. We just decided that it would be better if only a small portion of people actually dealt with it. Most of these animals are given full lives (as I can assume this older hen had) where they go through very few hardships. At the end of it all, that's probably more morally pleasant than just hunting whatever you can find.", "NTA, your gf is pretty judgmental of your grandmas way of life.", "NTA", "ohhh totally NTA\nI have 5 actual pet chickens (love them to death), but i also plan on being a small poultry farmer with more. Culling your animals is part of that job and lifestyle of homesteading, living off the land and such. I assume your grandma sees them as a food source, which is totally legit. Yes chickens can be very lovely pets that provide eggs and even emotional support, but your gf went into this KNOWING theyre not considered pets and that they will be culled to provide food. Your gf is TA for assuming that just because she likes a certain chicken (that isnt even hers to start with) would be excluded from the list of possible hens that would be killed to feed you and your family. And the hen that was picked makes even more sense because she was old and couldnt provide eggs anymore, which for me wouldnt be a problem as i love mine so much i will continue to provide for them until they die. But for those that have lived that life for so long it only makes sense to cull and make her into a nice roast dinner. This strikes me as typical city folk being shocked that farm life can be \"cruel\" by their standards. Also ur gf is extra TA for calling it \"barbaric\", like welcome to what people did before cities were a big thing and food was readily available at groccery stores. Wait until she sees factory farms lmao", "She \"demanded\"... smh. OP I think it's time to end the relationship. As soon as your gf tries to demand something of you its time. That's what gets me more. NTA", "As much as I can see why she might be upset, you\u2019re NTA. You gave her fair warning, and her comments about the culture being barbaric were out of line.", "Yep, I absolutely agree GF is really out of line with that comment. I love chickens, have a few of my own for eggs and to be spoiled pets. While any chickens I own are never going to wind up as a meal, that\u2019s my particular choice. Honestly, I have a lot of respect for people that raise livestock for meat as the animals usually have a lot better quality of life than any meat you buy from a store. Also, if you eat meat, and it sounds like GF does, you really can\u2019t be outraged about that process. I expect this is going to be more than just a one time problem with OP and GF.", "Agreed.  She would be an asshole without that comment, but it was horrendous.", "My friend's kid raised pigs for 4H and named them \"Bacon\" and \"Chops\". Chops came in 3rd and let me tell you, he was *delicious*.", "We named a steer dinner. Dinner was delicious.", "Had a rabbit named christmas dinner once", "My sister has a chicken named Nugget.", "I was going to say is she a vegetarian or just a hypocrite. NTA", "I knew from a young age especially when our roosters were killed. When I was 7 or 8, I'd always ask my parents what food I was eating and what animal it came from. I always got steak and chicken mixed up though lol.", "That's subjective, but then again, I don't raise my chicken flocks for livestock. Mostly just feathered pets that poop breakfast.", "I'm sorry but the girlfriend isn't an asshole for insulting grandma and claiming ownership of an animal she had no rights to?\n\nThat AH territory to me.", "Bruh all this shit is fake. It's honestly way more fun when you realize it's all fake", "OP said the chickens would be gone soon. It's a farm. What did she think they were going to do? Give them up for adoption? If that was her first thought, I would really question her common sense.\n\nAlso, the animals there don't belong to her, they belong to OP's grandma.\n\nLastly, she insulted grandmas lifestyle by calling it barbaric. \n\nYou don't need any additional info to conclude that OP is NTA.", "Didn't see that thread, but turtles of all species are going through an ecological crisis. Very different from domestic livestock.", "I know you're probably being sarcastic but I immediately thought of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, which wasn't Dr Seuss but did cover the rest of your point lol", "The Circle of Life isn't just a song from The Lion King.\n\nNTA.", "And unless she's vegan, she's a hypocrite.", "She may look at her food differently now, and that's not a bad thing. We don't give nearly the amount of consideration to the life we are eating without seeing it the way she has now.  \nShe's been privileged and just saw a brief glimpse of reality.  Remind her that every chicken she's eaten, every burger she's had, every slice of bacon was a life like that.  \n\nI'm not saying to not eat meat, to be clear, just to understand and respect where it came from.", "does she eat chicken?", "I've already commented about getting upset when I visited my relatives in former Yugoslavia. The difference is that I was only 11. Your girlfriend needs to grow up.   \n\n\nWhen I went back at the age of 14 I was fine. My relatives were worried about me. I managed to explain that I'd just been a kid the time before.", "I mean \u2026 have they never seen a live lobster tank in a restaurant or a grocery store? How is that any different?", "I was on a conference when one participant wanted to start a controversial and though provoking conversation by asking the group: \"If you had to kill the animal yourself, would you still eat meat?\" He was taken aback when everyone said \"Yes.\" Nobody there had actually killed and prepped an animal for a meal (except maybe catching fish) but we all knew we could and would do it, because we knew that's what people did since the beginning of time. \n\nHe had expected everyone to be blown away by the concept of food as living creatures rather than packaged at the supermarket.", "I bet they'd be surprised and grossed out by how many people go hunting here in my area.\n\nEdit: Just reminds me of the last time I went fishing. It was awesome. Everyone but me got so sick and I caught abunch of fish.", "I've been in meat markets in China, Thailand, Vietnamese, Colombia, Peru, and Ecudaor. The most shocking thing is the smell honestly - the meat selection mught scare OPS girlfriend,  but in those areas,  using the whole animal makes sense. People have to get food somehow,  and some countries don't have the luxury of offsetting the food production into a factory or get to dispose of \"unwanted bits\". Most are slain quickly,  then butchered and sold locally at the market the same day.  I wonder how his girlfriend would feel about Cuay since guineas pigs are pets in the US (in American and had it in SA, it's actually really good)", "my sister had a steer, his name was sir loin, he was a very noble and tasty cow\neta: forgot she also had meeko (me cow) and tbone, my niece named those ones when she was like 3. also delicious", "Our buck was name Gumbo when we raised rabbits...", "Bonus question: Did she eat other chickens that had been slaughtered while she was there?", "Thanks for chiming in as a vegan! :) Those chickens do have the best lives they can get. Most people in the country side have a garden or some sort of free roam space with lots of plants and digging spots for foraging. Lots of bugs and other diverse things for them to eat. People who *depend* on their livestock won't abuse them. They cannot afford to.", "Some might view them as pets, but that\u2019s still up to the owner to decide. If GF wanted that hen as a pet so bad she should\u2019ve asked if she could\u2019ve adopted it", "It\u2019s like walking into a screening of Endgame and cutting the projector and screaming \u201cDON\u2019T BELIEVE THESE LIES!1!1\u201d, no one\u2019s going to appreciate it.", "Unless they keep them as pets which they don't.", "Plant lives matter too!! /s\n\nEdit:\n\nI'm a meat eater, but I accept and appreciate where the meat I eat comes from.\n\nThe harsh reality is there is no way to survive in this world without taking life.

Because they kept complaining about the same things when egg prices went up because egg/chicken farms were getting bird flu.", "There is no hope for this species", "Yup. Or gone out and gotten her own with the necessary supplies. I knew a guy that raises and slaughters his own chickens, I didn't really have a problem with it. Not my flock anyway. I would ask what breeds he had if he knew, mainly if any caught my interest so I could go get my own for my flock.", "What you mean it's all lies???", "I'm with you. My friends who are vegetarian or vegan for health reasons, NP. When I get the meat lecture, keeping in mind I try really hard to get my meat from family co-ops, I get pretty irritated.

Sorry folks.", "I just whispered to my broccoli to make a sound", "We get some of our eggs from our coworker (some of my siblings and I work at the same place) and she gets them from this farmer lady.\n\nEdit: Theyre bigger then eggs at the store.

I ended up trying vegetarian and vegan stuff I never would have before.  Weird how that happens.", "I am with you and I agree with you and I also eat meat. The vast majority of meat slaughtering and human rights abuses in the meat industry are also perpetrated against migrant laborers. It is not just the agriculture industry.", "True\n\nEdit: I bet they don't care that a lot of goods from some countries are made from child labor/forced labor too.", "Interesting take. I disagree, though I'm not in the US so maybe things are different, given that migrant exploitation isn't a huge issue here and finding locally grown produce is easy if you try. All vegetarians I've met, myself included, are very very aware of the environmental impacts of consuming different foods. Most vego/vegan people I meet are trying to reduce their impact, not eliminate it entirely. It's not like you stop eating plants if you eat meat so I've always struggled with that particular argument.\n\nThere are exceptions and I have been absolutely dragged across the coals by a few vegans for not doing better. It is irritating as hell. Do not get me started on almond milk.\n\nIf you're slaughtering the meat yourself, chances are you've provided that animal with a good life. Chicken doesn't know what's coming. I'll happily point out free range butchers to friends because that's 100% better than the $2 chook from the supermarket. We're not all militant. I guess my most controversial hot take is that if you wouldn't lop the head off a chook and butcher it *yourself*, you probably shouldn't be eating chicken.", "My mom hates roosters, she was attacked by the ones she's had as a kid. But she seems to love the ones I raise, along with her little Japanese rooster she got last year. I do admit they are costly and can take up space depending on how many you have/how big their coop and run are/your own property size, but if you're able to with reasonable space and funds, it's not too bad. My mom and I have recently bonded more now that her and I raise chickens together after I moved back in.", "Daww that\u2019s so sweet to hear you bonded w your mom over the chickens. I definitely don\u2019t have anywhere enough space right now, but I feel once I get older I might rediscover that farming stage tbh. Fingers crossed", "Best of luck to you! My mom and I are thinking of exploring other things like beekeeping as well. It works out for me because I want to make mead."]}
