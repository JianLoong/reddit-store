My grandma has a chicken coop, and she has been slaughtering one every two weeks because she is trying to downsize the coop. She has done this a few times in the past when the grain harvest she uses to feed the chickens isn\u2019t going well, so she gets rid of some of the chickens because there isn\u2019t enough food to support all of them.\n\nI explained this to my girlfriend beforehand and warned her to not get too attached to any of the chickens because they may be gone soon. However, she disregarded what I said and hung out around the coop a lot for the week we were there. She got really attached to the oldest hen and would try to sneak it more food and things like that.\n\nMy grandma sent me a week after to slaughter that hen because it was getting old and couldn\u2019t lay eggs anymore. I did so, and my girlfriend was outraged when she found out (my grandma was getting ready to cook the hen in the kitchen.) She called me a cruel asshole for killing her \u201cpet,\u201d and demanded that we leave my grandma\u2019s farm and go to the city for the rest of the trip so she can \u201cescape the barbaric culture\u201d of my grandma\u2019s rural lifestyle.

You warned her.", "NTA I mean...she was warned. It wasn't her pet at all. She didn't own it, she didn't pay for anything for it. She has no rights to it.", "Your girlfriend is an asshole for calling your grandmother's way of rural life \"barbaric.\" She's insulted you and your family. You are absolutely NTA", "NTA. Honestly, seems your girlfriend needs someone to explain her where a lot of her groceries and proteins come from.", "Wow she\u2019s clueless \ud83d\ude02\nNTA", "NTA\u2026 some people need to learn how and where their meat comes from. \nI have a few stories, but I\u2019ll just share one. \n\nMy dad met my mom in Vietnam during the war.  My grandfather bought a young Turkey (or something like a Turkey) and my dad became attached to it. Visit everyday, talked to him etc. \nwell it was American thanksgiving and my grandfather invited my dad and his friends over for a typical American thanksgiving\u2026 when my dad went to say hi to his \u201cfriend\u201d he couldn\u2019t find him/her.  So out comes dinner\u2026 let\u2019s just say Dad only ate sides that year.", "NTA.  Does your girlfriend know where her food even comes from?  You even warned her against doing exactly what she did.", "Unless your GF is vegan, it sounds like she needs to learn a lot more respect for where her food comes from.\n\nIf she wants a pet chicken she can buy one from the person who has invested resources to raise it and relies on it for food. \n\nUntil then she can stay entirely out of what someone else need to do with their livestock. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You did warn her about what was going to happen and what does happen to the chickens. And \u201cbarbaric?\u201d How does she think people survived back then? We didn\u2019t always have grocery stores.", "NTA- though the title was a bit misleading at first!\n\n\nWe were sitting down to a delicious roast at my grandmas property one day, and I couldn\u2019t understand why my mother only had vegetables and gravy\n\nI figured it out pretty quickly the next day when I went to visit the cows and Daisy was absent from the herd\n\nA few red flags- she knew what was coming, who gets that attached to a random chicken so quickly, and does she understand the difference between a \u2018pet\u2019 and \u2018food?\u2019\n\nIf you slaughtered old Rover or Mittens, absolutely a different story- not a chook that is unable to fulfill its duties", "NTA. She has been warned. And such is the circle of life. I assume she has had a chicken sandwich before or chicken nuggets. Somebody has to butcher those animals, but I guess to her it's out of sight, out of mind.", "NTA.  Where does she think the chicken she eats from the store comes from?  At least this chicken was raised and allowed to age and be fed well.  She sounds a bit childish.", "**NTA** \\- Your girlfriend is, on the other hand, an AH for trying to control how grandma managed *her* livestock.", "Probably the easiest NTA I have ever seen.\n\nDid your girlfriend go to school? Genuinely don\u2019t know how someone exists for 24 years not understanding even slightly where food comes from", "NTA, and unfortunately probably time to find a new girlfriend. That might be harsh of me to day, and I definitely don't know your gf and you, but if she's that upset over a chicken she spent a few days with, she'll probably never let it go and it'll end up being a dark cloud on y'alls relationship.", "NTA. Such is farm life.", "NTA. Where does she think meat comes from?", "NTA. You told her not to get attached to any of the chickens. She has to realize farming and killing animals for food has kept us alive as humans, and it's much healthier than buying grocery store meat. You should never, ever name your food! I'm sorry she got hurt, bit you did explain the situation and tried to warn her.", "NTA, and your girlfriend's attitude is frankly appalling. \"Barbaric,\" my ass.", "NTA. Somehow maybe I think your relationship is not going to make it. Good luck.", "NTA. Farm animals aren\u2019t pets.", "NTA- It wasn't your girlfriends pet, it was your grandmas Live stock.", "NTA-  this is why ours were named \u2018lunch\u2019 and \u2018dinner\u2019", "NTA. i get that it sucks but you did warn her, and she doesn\u2019t own the chicken. so it wasn\u2019t really her pet. i\u2019ll sound rude by saying this, but she\u2019s just gonna have to get over it and move on", "NTA. Besides all the great reasons given by everyone else, the chicken was not hers. It belonged to your grandmother, it was not your girlfriend's to claim as her \"pet.\" This is like going into someone else's house and claiming their dog or cat as your pet and then getting angry when they don't feed them the way you want, or trying to take them home with you.\n\nShe knew coming in that this was a working farm, you gave her plenty of warning, and she made the conscious decision to ignore you. She also was the one who wanted to come with you when you made your annual trip to be with your family. She needs to adapt to you, not the other way around.", "Massive NTA - ESPECIALLY because this discourse surrounding families who own livestock and sacrifice them being 'barbaric' pisses me off. Does she think the animals being locked up in tiny cages in a mass production farm is more ethical? She eats meat. Does she think it's lab grown? I grew up with chickens. Yes, it sucked when they had to be sacrificed due to age or illness, or purely because they were aggressive to the flock or cannibalistic (chickens can be horrible) but I knew the chickens were eventually going to end up as that for x y or z reason. I hate people who consider it barbaric, infinite times more if they are hypocritical enough to consume animal produce.", "NTA. You told her not to get attached.", "Easy NTA.", "NTA You warned your gf she disregarded it. Does she eat chicken? If she does then she's just as \"barbaric\" as grandma is. If she wants to go to the city tell her to go ahead. You're spending time with your grandma.", "NTA\n\nAnd I N F O: does she eat chicken?", "NTA since you warned her. She just not used to farm life.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of the story about the little boy who said to his parents \u201cisn\u2019t it funny that there\u2019s chicken the meat and chicken the animal?\u201d Sometimes people just don\u2019t join the dots.", "NTA. She knew what was going to happen, you told her not to get attached, she got attached anyways. That's on her.", "NTA. But the woman who called you, your grandma and your culture barbaric is T A. \nYou didn\u2019t get her a chicken as a pet and then conspired with your gran to murder it. It was a chicken at a FARM and you told her how things normally go/will go. What other ways of living your family has will be deemed as barbaric?", "NTA", "NTA: I eat meat but I don't wanna see where it comes from so I stay away. She should have taken your warning more seriously.", "NTA\n\nThe title should be \u201cAITA for ignoring my overly sensitive girlfriend and doing what my grandmother asked me to do with my grandmothers livestock?\u201d", "nta she knew the deal i mean where does she think the chicken she eats comes from? how does she think it\u2019s harvested? from the chicken tree?", "When it's time for them to go to \"freezer camp,\" it's time. It's the circle of life. Is she vegan,  or just finally had to face where her delicious chicken nuggies come from?", "NTA, but an unfortunate situation. A friend of mine grew up on a farm and his grandmother had a rule: *Don't name the food.*", "NTA. You warned her, and she grew attached to the hen anyway. Regardless, it's not your fault for slaughtering the chicken. As cruel as it may seem, the hen can no longer lay eggs, and therefore is a burden if you live a rural lifestyle as you are providing for it, while getting nothing in return.\n\nThis is the way of life, that many people followed and continue to follow. It's cruel, but it's necessary.", "NTA - Cluck cluck, good luck with her..", "NTA because that is how it works on a farm but you probably could have convinced grandma to not kill that one until you were gone", "Nta\n\nExactly where does she think meat comes from? A bundle from a stork?", "I'm not sure this is the apocalypse partner for you. NTA. You can't love life of you don't respect death. I'm sure you made quick work of your responsibility so that the hen didn't suffer needlessly. Meat from Chickens that lived well is going to be fantastic and it doesn't get any fresher.", "yawn an other fake", "NAH Sometimes you cant control how you feel about an animal, try to empathize with her and come to a mutual understanding.", "INFO: When you told her that you would \"get rid of some of the chickens,\" did you say that they would be slaughtered?", "You see animals as tools.

Thankfully this is nothing like that.", "NTA. Your girlfriend seems to have lived a very sheltered life, where does she think the food comes from? Calling rural farm life barbaric, is incredibly rude and reeks of entitlement. You warned her not to get attached to livestock, a child understands that concept. Slaughtering a hen that can no longer lay eggs, during a time when the feed for them is in short supply isn't cruelty, it's practicality and just a part of life. It would be more cruel to have the chickens go hungry due to the shortage of food, rather than just butchering a small number of them...", "NTA. But your gf absolutely is an ignorant one. You know you have to break up with her right? You two will never have a future; she disrespects who you are.", "NTA.

I choked, and woke my dog.", "Honestly the only reason I know where food comes from is from documentaries shown in school. There\u2019s one that\u2019s particularly graphic about mass food production that we watched. But I just assumed based on that that animals have to produce something to be worth keeping alive and hens produce eggs. If they can\u2019t produce eggs why keep them? Best to make them into food at that point.", "Seriously, it was amazing to me when we had that chicken shortage in the US at the beginning of the pandemic how many people at the grocery store were shocked that an issue with the animal leads to a shortage of the meat in stores. A lot of them thought that the deli could just make more chicken meat", "Honestly does your gf eat at all?  Even vegetables used to be alive", "Assumed so.

Guarantee your grandma farm is more human then the butcher or egg industry", "I feel like it's more cruel to the people that become attached, of which I am one.

Your girlfriend was warned, she should have stayed away.", "I don't think it's cruel per se. it's no more cruel than when my cat killed and ate a bug the other day (do we not feed you enough?!). Its how life is, and life can be cruel if you look at it from certain perspectives.", "But the city people don't actually see the cruelty 1st hand so it doesn't count/they don't have to think about it. /s\n\nEdited for grammar", "Not cruel. I\u2019ve had a farm. You name it sheep, chickens, goats, pigs etc. they live a good life and then, if done humanely, they are no more and feel nothing in the transition. It is life.

She was warned and still got attached.", "I kinda feel like her particular brand of tough farm lady would be personally bothered by some city girl wasting extra grain befriending an old hen, and would deliberately bump that one up the list. \n\nNTA. What did she expect? It\u2019s a farm.", "In that case, NTA. If she did not eat chicken, I would have voted NAH but since she eats chicken she\u2019s a hypocrite.
