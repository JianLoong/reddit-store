It\u2019s alright for the most part, and we stay out of each-others hair, except for recent events.\n\nMy parents regularly work night shifts and when they do so, I get a feel of having my own room by sleeping in their room instead. \nIt\u2019s very liberating and makes me excited to have my own room one day! \n\nHowever, my sister decided that as soon as I went to bed in my parents bedroom, she would change the layout of our bedroom.\n\nOur bedroom is basically two single beds on each hand-corner of the bedroom, creating a hallway-like space between each bed. \nWhilst I was asleep, in my parents room, my sister decided to push our beds right next to each-other. In doing so, she actually unscrewed all the drawers and cupboards under our bed that was facing the hallway, and re-attached them to face the outer walls. This has made it difficult for me to even attempt to move my bed back, as I will not have access to clothing and revision books if I try.\n\nBoth of our beds together are now merged to look like a double bed, and ever since I saw the room I have not slept in the bed, as this would have me unnecessarily close to her whilst I am sleeping.\n\nI asked her to move the beds back and fix everything in the room back to exactly how it was beforehand, as I did not agree to the arrangement, she simply did not reply. \nI voiced my concern to my parents on our family group-chat and she got told off, but no further action was taken.\n\nI have not slept in my own bedroom for two days now, but rather sleeping downstairs on the sofa. I attempted to separate our beds after my birthday dinner today, whilst she was in the toilet, and she returned to the room to scream in my face, and moved her bed right back up to the middle of the room. \n\nThe lack of distance between our beds makes me so uncomfortable - I ended up leaving the room in a rage. My father heard the commotion and shouted at me, asking why I was be so dramatic, and what all this drama was for. He has known of the situation for 2 days now, and had been assuring me he would tell my sister to return the room back to normal, but I guess he lied.\n\nGrowing up with parents that regularly tell me off, I\u2019ve learned to just be quiet and ignore them, in hopes they\u2019ll ignore me. However, the situation and my emotions got the better of me and I shouted back at him, saying I felt uncomfortable and that my parents shouldn\u2019t let her get away with such things. I feel so guilty for shouting back at my dad, as I am normally the calm sibling.\n\nI am now back downstairs, with fear I\u2019ll never be able to sleep in my own room again, whilst my sister has it all to herself. It seems to me it\u2019s my fault, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done? Is it wrong to want personal space?

How could you not be upset?\n\nI dont know if its possible but do you think you could just sit down with your sister and talk about why it is important for you. I think when you left her in this room alone, she felt the same as you did when you were in your parents room: Alone at last!\n\nAnd she was maybe engrossed by the feeling and wanted to make this room the way it would be if she was free of doing whatever she wanted. Was she greedy? yes.\n\nBut I think the both of you need the same: peace and a safe place to call home.\n\nYou can either:\n\n\\- discuss it and try to organise your common space so that it would feel both yours and hers. \n\n\\- malicious compliance: if she wants you right up in her own personal space by bringing the bed together, show her in a very loud and messy, chaotic way why she should have thought twice about it, and let's see how long she will stand it before begging to go back to the way you were before. \n\nYour parents are not parenting they are axxholing, I'm so sorry that you can not even rely on them when you're so young. The phrase \"I am normally the calm sibling.\" is so telling.\n\nYou have a right to voice your feelings as loudly and as messily as you need when you are unheard and invisbilized.
