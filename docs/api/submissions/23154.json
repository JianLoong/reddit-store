In doing so, she actually unscrewed all the drawers and cupboards under our bed that was facing the hallway, and re-attached them to face the outer walls. This has made it difficult for me to even attempt to move my bed back, as I will not have access to clothing and revision books if I try.\n\nBoth of our beds together are now merged to look like a double bed, and ever since I saw the room I have not slept in the bed, as this would have me unnecessarily close to her whilst I am sleeping.\n\nI asked her to move the beds back and fix everything in the room back to exactly how it was beforehand, as I did not agree to the arrangement, she simply did not reply. \nI voiced my concern to my parents on our family group-chat and she got told off, but no further action was taken.\n\nI have not slept in my own bedroom for two days now, but rather sleeping downstairs on the sofa. I attempted to separate our beds after my birthday dinner today, whilst she was in the toilet, and she returned to the room to scream in my face, and moved her bed right back up to the middle of the room. \n\nThe lack of distance between our beds makes me so uncomfortable - I ended up leaving the room in a rage. My father heard the commotion and shouted at me, asking why I was be so dramatic, and what all this drama was for. He has known of the situation for 2 days now, and had been assuring me he would tell my sister to return the room back to normal, but I guess he lied.\n\nGrowing up with parents that regularly tell me off, I\u2019ve learned to just be quiet and ignore them, in hopes they\u2019ll ignore me. However, the situation and my emotions got the better of me and I shouted back at him, saying I felt uncomfortable and that my parents shouldn\u2019t let her get away with such things. I feel so guilty for shouting back at my dad, as I am normally the calm sibling.\n\nI am now back downstairs, with fear I\u2019ll never be able to sleep in my own room again, whilst my sister has it all to herself.

You're totally NTA . If you guys have the option for a comfortable set up and she unilaterally changed it ,that's wrong .", "NTA. I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I absolutely understand the need for personal space - I (female) used to share a room with my brother for 18 years. It wasn't easy and I was so happy when one of us had a sleepover at our grandmother's home so the other one had a room for themselves", "ESH. Growing up, my family was in 3 different rental apartments/houses each one with only 2 bedrooms so I had to share a room with my little sister until I moved out when I was 18 because I was ready to start college and living with my longterm boyfriend. My sister and I are 4 years apart, so I was reading your post imagining my sister and I, when I was 15 and she was 11 so not too far off from your sister's 13. I did not mind sharing a room or occasionally a bed with my sister. Now that we are 23 and 19, I look back and wish I would've spent more time hanging out with her. But anyways back to the reply: if your sister moved the beds together when you are using your parent's bed, maybe she just felt it was unfair that you got to have a bigger bed to sleep in or maybe she saw that you preferred the bigger bed, not realizing that you were using it to have your own room, and tried recreating it in your shared room. Even when my sister and I shared a room but decided to split our bunk bed into 2 separate beds, we would still scoot them together to build forts and have \"sleepovers\", so maybe that's another reason she had for doing that, like just wanting to spend time together. She should have moved it back to the way it was after you asked her to nicely and not yelled at you, but you could've waited until she came back from the bathroom that night and talked about it again instead of taking it apart yourself without her knowing.\n\nTL,DR: Sister should have moved the bed back when asked nicely, but you shouldn't have taken it apart without her knowing. I don't get why you're uncomfortable sleeping close to your little sister.", "NTA.

Ofc it may not work for you but it's worth a try . Your sister seems to be trying to push you out and have the room to herself so assert dominance fast , eat on the bed , leave dirty clothes on it  ,keep it strewn with books , when yall go to bed keep your phone or laptop on so she's disturbed by the light.

You choose everyone ELSE to be happy... Not you... You're miserable. You're a person too, and deserve respect", "I think some malicious compliance is in order here. Start \u2018rolling over in your sleep\u2019 right on to her side. Occasionally fling an arm or leg in her direction, sleep mutter or snore loudly when her face is close to yours.
