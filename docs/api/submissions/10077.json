I am going to start by adding some much needed context. I (26f) met this coworker (24f) we will call Sarah in January when we were both hired at the same time. I do an hour and a half commute to work and back every day that includes picking up this coworker and her daughter, taking her daughter to daycare then heading to the office (I do the same on the way home). I listen to all kinds of different music and once before while listening to a song by Doris Day Sarah turned the song without asking and said \u201cWhy are you listening to this crap\u201d, not being sure how to act I laughed it off. \n\nYesterday morning Sarah got in my car then she started making faces when hearing The Ink Spots, knowing she didn\u2019t like it I went ahead and changed my whole playlist. I thought everything was fine but as soon as we dropped her daughter off at daycare Sarah started yelling at me calling me racist. I was extremely confused and just stared at her not knowing where this came from. The following conversation ensued while I was driving: \n\nSarah: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d shove your racism straight into mine and my daughters faces! You know all that shit (the music) was stolen from black people! \n\nMe: You of all people know I am the furthest thing from racist, not to mention the guys singing that song are actually black?\n\nSarah: You are totally racist and you fetishize black women! Those guys aren\u2019t even black, you\u2019re lying!\n\n(I have a history of dating black women but in no way have I ever \u201cfetishized\u201d them) \n\nMe: Don\u2019t believe me? Look them up.\n\nAfter Sarah looked them up she didn\u2019t say anything to me for the rest of the ride or day until it was time to leave. I calmly explained that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable driving her around anymore if she\u2019s going to accuse me of things. This didn\u2019t go over very well and she started screaming at me in the parking lot. A different coworker gave her a ride home. \n\nWhen I got to work this morning I was immediately called into HR. They explained to me that I\u2019ve had an anonymous complaint about making racist remarks towards coworkers AND CLIENTS. I explained the whole situation to HR and they said they would handle it, I haven\u2019t heard anything else yet. The entire day was really weird and one coworker caught me in the parking lot before I left. She told to me that Sarah has been telling everyone at work that I am extremely racist so now no one wants anything to do with me. \n\nI have NEVER in my life been accused of such a thing and now I am extremely worried that I am going to lose my job OR be so uncomfortable there that I will have to find a new job.\n\nEdit: Reddit wanted me to change the name\n\nEdit to add: Thank you to everyone who responded, I was extremely worried I\u2019d done something wrong. After reading all of the replies I will be having a meeting with HR in the morning, along with the coworker that told me about the things being said.", "created_utc": 1676503189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113bnfq/aita_for_playing_oldies_in_the_car_with_my/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My playlist is full of more modern artists (Diana Krall, Rod Stewart) singing those great standards.\n\nAlso, as an HR person, let me assure you that you need to go back to HR and tell them that Sarah is slandering you and that they need to put a stop to it.

It's bullying and workplace harassment.", "If the complaint is actually anonymous then they'd have to prove that you did what is alleged and as no clients or co-workers other than V would have anything bad to say about you I can't see you losing your job for this.\n\nIf they're just saying it's anonymous because they don't want to tell you it was V who made the complaint, then it's her word against yours.  Again I don't think you can lose your job because of hearsay.\n\nAs for an uncomfortable work environment, I doubt this will be the only time V will flip out over perceived racism so hopefully you co-workers will see who she is really is.", "NTA, but get that coworker that came to you to HR asap!
