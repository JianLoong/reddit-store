It pisses me off sooo much cause it wasn't a decision I made. I tell them time and time again that I'm not Catholic and they don't care what I say because\"in God's eyes you are\" no. I hate it. Stand your ground!! Your son will later thank you.", "NTA. You and your wife decided what was morally right for your family.

You could lie and say you did to appease him if you want an easy compromise.", "NTA. It's a little more than getting his hair wet, it's bringing him into an entire institution. And that institution is powerful enough to make your wife change her mind. You should definitely tell him no. This feels so incredibly manipulative of your FIL.", "NTA. Your decision what you do/do not want for your child. The fact he's dying doesn't mean he gets whatever he wants. If it was something small and reasonable, maybe a little wiggle room. But baptism is a big thing. In my faith, it's a commitment. I'm not Catholic, but I think they view it somewhat similarly. To make a commitment with no intent to follow through would be making a mockery of the commitment. I don't think FIL is thinking about that part. If he were asking for something like, would you please come to Mass or read the Bible with me, then maybe consider it. But not baptism.", "NTA.  The pair of you decided this before.", "You're not the AH, but you should also step back and look at what is happening. I was baptized but I ended up as an atheist. Being baptized was literally just being dunked in water. I was too young to remember and don't care that it happened. I think if it keeps the peace in the house, you should probably just let them do it, but if this is a really important conviction for you then you should have a serious talk with your wife about why you are so opposed to it. If you are very anti-religion then it makes sense that you are against it, but if you are neutral and don't care about it one way or the other, then your son being baptized won't impact you.", "NTA. I feel for your FIL and his condition, but being on your deathbed does not give you license to strong arm the people around you to do everything you want by calling it a \"dying wish.\" By doing so, your FIL is being manipulative towards you and your wife, knowing that his condition would put pressure on the two of you.\n\nReligious rituals like baptism (and religion itself) are deeply personal, and it is horribly wrong of someone to force someone else to participate in them.", "NTA.  For me (practicing Catholic, by the way) I wouldn\u2019t want to volunteer to be in a situation that makes me a public liar.  The actual rite asks you why are there and you reply to all that you want your child baptized and you later promise to raise the child in the faith.  You will need to find godparents who promise the same.  Some on here are saying who cares if his head gets wet because you don\u2019t believe in it but I wouldn\u2019t do it for your personal integrity and the priest might not allow it anyway.", "NTA. Your wife and you made the decision not to baptize your son, giving him the choice to make that decision himself when he is older. While  I get why you wife wants to do something for her father, if it wasn't an issue before, although this may sound harsh, I don't think he gets to call the shots just because he is now dying.

It can't be just one party changing their mind and deciding that absolutely that's what's going to happen. Talk to her, see what she expects.

If it's really that important then yeah hold your ground but this 2 year old is not going to remember getting dunked in water. If they grow up to be atheist then they shouldn't care because the ceremony holds no meaning, if they do grow up to be Christian then it is also naturally fine.

Nothing wrong with not wanting your child to be groomed and indoctrinated.", "As a Catholic I\u2019m saying NTA. He\u2019s asking you to make false promises to raise the child Catholic. If your wife isn\u2019t willing to really make that commitment than it\u2019s for show.", "NTA.  It\u2019s definitely the parents\u2019 decision.  It sounds like your in-laws are Catholic, and if that\u2019s the case, it would be difficult to impossible to find a priest or deacon to baptize against the express wishes of the parents.  Having a dying grandparent who wants to see a child baptized is not sufficient reason, as difficult and painful as that is.  \nIt\u2019s true that in times past (particularly in the last century) children would surreptitiously be baptized, but this practice really flouted the rules and intent of the sacrament.  Since then, the Catholic Church in the US has really cracked down on such.  I think some Catholics haven\u2019t quite caught up.  \nFrom a believer\u2019s perspective (like mine), baptizing a child whose parents are not believers or who have no intention of raising the child in the faith is actually dangerous.  Spiritually speaking, claiming a child for Christ and then abandoning them leaves that child spiritually vulnerable.  \nThe faith of the parents is paramount in this sacrament when it\u2019s a child being baptized.  \nI think you are generally on solid reasoning here, but for the sake of peace and love at this difficult time, I suggest staying away from flip references to your in-laws\u2019 faith (ie, getting his hair wet to appease a dying man).  You can acknowledge the depth and significance of what they\u2019re asking while still rightly rejecting it.", "NTA. Fuck no nobody gets to tell me what to do with my kid and religion. Tell your wife no means no.", "YTA, if you're an atheist then what does it matter? It's like a ceremony to make a loved one happy that means nothing to you", "Personally...I don't think you should.  The only reason you would be doing it is to appease a dying man's wish, so there would be no 'faith' behind the action.  A fib, a kind fib, but a fib nonetheless.  So just tell grandpa that you had little jimmy baptized.  It's still nothing more than the same fib just from a different angle.  Finally...being a recovering former Catholic myself, it's unlikely the church would baptize a child unless at least one of you was a practicing member of a given congregation.  I know you're just trying to lessen a dying man's burden...just tell him a white lie so he can pass quietly.", "If you decide to get your son baptized, you don't have to go through the Catholic Church to do so. Other churches have baptism ceremonies. My grandma was always upset that her great granddaughter wasn't baptized.\n\nSo, if it makes your wife happy to give her father some peace of mind before he dies, why not do it? At least it wouldn't hurt to look into it. I'm speaking as an atheist, for what it's worth.", "It\u2019s just a little water and people with weird customs. It\u2019s not going to harm the baby.

You\u2019re NTA but just do it", "I'm gonna say YTA because this isn't a hill to die on and giving in keeps the peace. Being baptized as a baby doesn't determine your son's religious beliefs. He's getting dunked in some water to make your wife's family happy and save her and you a bunch of drama. You think your inlaws will let you live it down if your FIL dies without seeing his grandson baptized? Your son can still choose what to believe when he gets older. I was baptized and now I'm an atheist. It affected nothing.", "It seems like a pretty small sacrifice to make your in-laws happy. I would probably just do the baptism.", "If Jesus isn\u2019t real, then what harm would come of having a man in a dress put some water on your kid\u2019s head. Do it for the old man.

Just the ones that think the baby will go to hell if it dies unbaptized. The church I grew up in required the person being baptized to be old enough to understand what it meant and consent to have it done. Same to become a member of the church. Same to take communion (which was open to all, not just members). No longer Christian at all, but I would never have agreed to baptism of a child too young to understand.", "Maybe NTA. I was baptized, did it make an impact in my life, I'd say no. Did I sell my soul to a higher power, I don't believe so. It is just water poured onto a baby's head, give it a bath, water falls. If you do not believe anyways in religion what is some water and prayers that will not do a thing hurt a person. Later on. Your child can decide. Again will the baptism change the baby's path, happiness, political view, thoughts, feelings. But if it is a hill you are willing to die on. Then it is definitely your choice.", "NTA - that is not his call to make, and death is not an opportunity to overstep your bounds in the lives of those you leave behind.\n\nYour wife should be more concerned about forcing you to agree to something for your child to please others. **Being a good parent should be her priority over being a good child.** Her parents have already done their parenting.", "NTA. Don\u2019t buy into this misogynist BS. \nI know it\u2019s just water on the head but when will attitudes change.

I used to live in the Philippines, where my daughter was born to my Filipina wife.  My daughter was baptized but then raised non-religious.  The baptism has never been an issue.  I\u2019m sure, at the time, it made some family members on both sides happy.  Didn\u2019t hurt nor influence the kid, now 22, one bit.", "I would explain to the grandfather you are not Catholic and want to wait until your son is old enough to make his own commitment to God. Offer for him to write a letter to your son explaining why baptism is so important to him and you\u2019ll pass it along when the time is right. You are not the AH but see if you can handle the situation with a little grace. I would not have him baptized just to appease his grandfather. It should be more meaning than that.", "NTA.

Your FiL is dying, I don\u2019t think you need to worry on his account as it soon won\u2019t matter to him.

My ex and I moved to the South and found a Church.  I was somewhat against going to Church, but my ex decided he really wanted to.  I finally gave in.  So we found one, and made some friends.  I'll admit I drank the Kool aid a bit, and the ex and I got baptized at that church.  I never told the Baptist church I was already baptized as a Catholic.

We lie to dying people all the time, why not a baptism you have no plans of following up on with actual education? \n\nI'm Christian so maybe my opinion is invalid, but when we had our babies baptized, it was less about the baby and more about us promising to raise the baby the way God wanted us to.

Baptism in each denomination can be very different.  \n\nA Catholic would not accept baptism in a different tradition, since they believe that baptism is an actual spiritual event, not a metaphor or symbol of faith.

That toddler is going straight to hell if he doesn\u2019t get that holy water on his head.", "The types of Christians that baptize aren't big into letting kids think for themselves. In fact my experience dictates the opposite: Most religious parents are desperate to force their kids to join the cult.", "Here\u2019s the thing. Parents can\u2019t \u201cnot influence\u201d the kids and \u201clet them decide when they\u2019re older\u201d because a lack of practice is practice in and of itself. I don\u2019t have kids and consider myself an agnostic, so I have no skin in the game but it is wildly naive to say that by not raising kids in any religion you\u2019re letting them decide. \n\nYou\u2019re indoctrinating your child into a lack of belief the same way people who practice a religion indoctrinate their child into a belief. \n\nNo matter how a kid is raised, the key is to let them explore faith when they\u2019re older and not punish them for having a different belief system.", "Oh boy I once got called a Devil worshipper by my paternal grandmother because I had my makeup done in traditional norse makeup by my brother\u2019s girlfriend who\u2019s a norse pagan on the first day of fall and well let\u2019s just say that was the first of many bad incidents in her last few months living with us and I\u2019m currently very low to no contact with her atm.", "That's why I say \"bless the hands that prepared the meal\". No arguments.", "You can't just say something rude and put \"no offense\" before it, then expect it not to be rude.", " True.  I'm not 100%.  I have baptist friends who go through late teenage baptism,  that's probably more what I should have said", "Maybe you live in a very different country, but in mine, everyone gets baptized when they are young because it's a tradition and a way to celebrate the child with everyone. Most people are not even that religious.\n\nMy parents and all the parents of my friends did not try to take away our individuality or our independence. That's why most of us became agnostic or atheist despite the baptism.", "I want my son to be baptized but I\u2019d be fine if he chose a different religion as he got older. There are way too many religions and people from different walks of life for any one to be right or absolute. But I don\u2019t see him being blessed by God in a ceremony with his loving family around to celebrate it as a bad thing \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I disagree. \nI was raised around the Catholic religion, but not baptized. I was the ONLY one in my family not baptized. When I was 16, I got baptized only because my boyfriends father at the time told me if I didn't get baptized I couldn't date his son. Little did he know.. after I was baptized we made out in the conservatory area. Wet white robe and all. \n\nMy husband is strictly anti religion. \n\nI have a faith I believe in - \nBe a good person and go to heaven. \nAppreciate the earth and all her precious gifts. \nIf you must pray, why not pray to all the God's and Goddesses.. they are listening. \nMade up you say? Well.. lol I may not have a book but my faith has kept me strong. \nI have faith in myself and my family - kids and husband's and my mother (RIP). I have faith in good people. Nature is my religion in more ways than one. \n\nWhen my kids asked about religion - growing up in the Bible belt. I told them to research it. Together, they and I learned about the different aspects of religion and I never gave my opinion. \n\nMy kids are young adults now. They both are not baptized. My oldest believes there is a higher power that watches over us and believes in miracles and faith. My youngest is not one way or another. They are just a good person living their best life. \n\nThey get to CHOOSE. Just like I did. Which is what my mother wanted. And I did. I am strong and I try my darndest to be a good person and to be true to what I believe.", "If you still want to get under her skin, just go full-nuclear and point out that transubstantiation of the communion elements is cannibalism...  But only if you want to go full nuclear."]}
