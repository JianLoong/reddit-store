It pisses me off sooo much cause it wasn't a decision I made. I tell them time and time again that I'm not Catholic and they don't care what I say because\"in God's eyes you are\" no. I hate it. Stand your ground!! Your son will later thank you.", "NTA. You and your wife decided what was morally right for your family.

You could lie and say you did to appease him if you want an easy compromise.", "NTA. It's a little more than getting his hair wet, it's bringing him into an entire institution. And that institution is powerful enough to make your wife change her mind. You should definitely tell him no. This feels so incredibly manipulative of your FIL.", "NTA. Your decision what you do/do not want for your child. The fact he's dying doesn't mean he gets whatever he wants. If it was something small and reasonable, maybe a little wiggle room. But baptism is a big thing. In my faith, it's a commitment. I'm not Catholic, but I think they view it somewhat similarly. To make a commitment with no intent to follow through would be making a mockery of the commitment. I don't think FIL is thinking about that part. If he were asking for something like, would you please come to Mass or read the Bible with me, then maybe consider it. But not baptism.", "NTA.  The pair of you decided this before.", "You're not the AH, but you should also step back and look at what is happening. I was baptized but I ended up as an atheist. Being baptized was literally just being dunked in water. I was too young to remember and don't care that it happened. I think if it keeps the peace in the house, you should probably just let them do it, but if this is a really important conviction for you then you should have a serious talk with your wife about why you are so opposed to it. If you are very anti-religion then it makes sense that you are against it, but if you are neutral and don't care about it one way or the other, then your son being baptized won't impact you.", "NTA. I feel for your FIL and his condition, but being on your deathbed does not give you license to strong arm the people around you to do everything you want by calling it a \"dying wish.\" By doing so, your FIL is being manipulative towards you and your wife, knowing that his condition would put pressure on the two of you.\n\nReligious rituals like baptism (and religion itself) are deeply personal, and it is horribly wrong of someone to force someone else to participate in them.", "NTA.  For me (practicing Catholic, by the way) I wouldn\u2019t want to volunteer to be in a situation that makes me a public liar.  The actual rite asks you why are there and you reply to all that you want your child baptized and you later promise to raise the child in the faith.  You will need to find godparents who promise the same.  Some on here are saying who cares if his head gets wet because you don\u2019t believe in it but I wouldn\u2019t do it for your personal integrity and the priest might not allow it anyway.", "NTA. Your wife and you made the decision not to baptize your son, giving him the choice to make that decision himself when he is older. While  I get why you wife wants to do something for her father, if it wasn't an issue before, although this may sound harsh, I don't think he gets to call the shots just because he is now dying.

It can't be just one party changing their mind and deciding that absolutely that's what's going to happen. Talk to her, see what she expects.

If it's really that important then yeah hold your ground but this 2 year old is not going to remember getting dunked in water. If they grow up to be atheist then they shouldn't care because the ceremony holds no meaning, if they do grow up to be Christian then it is also naturally fine.

Nothing wrong with not wanting your child to be groomed and indoctrinated.", "As a Catholic I\u2019m saying NTA. He\u2019s asking you to make false promises to raise the child Catholic. If your wife isn\u2019t willing to really make that commitment than it\u2019s for show.", "NTA.  It\u2019s definitely the parents\u2019 decision.  It sounds like your in-laws are Catholic, and if that\u2019s the case, it would be difficult to impossible to find a priest or deacon to baptize against the express wishes of the parents.  Having a dying grandparent who wants to see a child baptized is not sufficient reason, as difficult and painful as that is.  \nIt\u2019s true that in times past (particularly in the last century) children would surreptitiously be baptized, but this practice really flouted the rules and intent of the sacrament.  Since then, the Catholic Church in the US has really cracked down on such.  I think some Catholics haven\u2019t quite caught up.  \nFrom a believer\u2019s perspective (like mine), baptizing a child whose parents are not believers or who have no intention of raising the child in the faith is actually dangerous.  Spiritually speaking, claiming a child for Christ and then abandoning them leaves that child spiritually vulnerable.  \nThe faith of the parents is paramount in this sacrament when it\u2019s a child being baptized.  \nI think you are generally on solid reasoning here, but for the sake of peace and love at this difficult time, I suggest staying away from flip references to your in-laws\u2019 faith (ie, getting his hair wet to appease a dying man).  You can acknowledge the depth and significance of what they\u2019re asking while still rightly rejecting it.", "NTA. Fuck no nobody gets to tell me what to do with my kid and religion. Tell your wife no means no.", "YTA, if you're an atheist then what does it matter? It's like a ceremony to make a loved one happy that means nothing to you", "Personally...I don't think you should.  The only reason you would be doing it is to appease a dying man's wish, so there would be no 'faith' behind the action.  A fib, a kind fib, but a fib nonetheless.  So just tell grandpa that you had little jimmy baptized.  It's still nothing more than the same fib just from a different angle.  Finally...being a recovering former Catholic myself, it's unlikely the church would baptize a child unless at least one of you was a practicing member of a given congregation.  I know you're just trying to lessen a dying man's burden...just tell him a white lie so he can pass quietly.", "If you decide to get your son baptized, you don't have to go through the Catholic Church to do so. Other churches have baptism ceremonies. My grandma was always upset that her great granddaughter wasn't baptized.\n\nSo, if it makes your wife happy to give her father some peace of mind before he dies, why not do it? At least it wouldn't hurt to look into it. I'm speaking as an atheist, for what it's worth.", "It\u2019s just a little water and people with weird customs. It\u2019s not going to harm the baby.

You\u2019re NTA but just do it", "I'm gonna say YTA because this isn't a hill to die on and giving in keeps the peace. Being baptized as a baby doesn't determine your son's religious beliefs. He's getting dunked in some water to make your wife's family happy and save her and you a bunch of drama. You think your inlaws will let you live it down if your FIL dies without seeing his grandson baptized? Your son can still choose what to believe when he gets older. I was baptized and now I'm an atheist. It affected nothing.", "It seems like a pretty small sacrifice to make your in-laws happy. I would probably just do the baptism.", "If Jesus isn\u2019t real, then what harm would come of having a man in a dress put some water on your kid\u2019s head. Do it for the old man.

Just the ones that think the baby will go to hell if it dies unbaptized. The church I grew up in required the person being baptized to be old enough to understand what it meant and consent to have it done. Same to become a member of the church. Same to take communion (which was open to all, not just members). No longer Christian at all, but I would never have agreed to baptism of a child too young to understand.", "Maybe NTA. I was baptized, did it make an impact in my life, I'd say no. Did I sell my soul to a higher power, I don't believe so. It is just water poured onto a baby's head, give it a bath, water falls. If you do not believe anyways in religion what is some water and prayers that will not do a thing hurt a person. Later on. Your child can decide. Again will the baptism change the baby's path, happiness, political view, thoughts, feelings. But if it is a hill you are willing to die on. Then it is definitely your choice.", "NTA - that is not his call to make, and death is not an opportunity to overstep your bounds in the lives of those you leave behind.\n\nYour wife should be more concerned about forcing you to agree to something for your child to please others. **Being a good parent should be her priority over being a good child.** Her parents have already done their parenting.", "NTA. Don\u2019t buy into this misogynist BS. \nI know it\u2019s just water on the head but when will attitudes change.

I used to live in the Philippines, where my daughter was born to my Filipina wife.  My daughter was baptized but then raised non-religious.  The baptism has never been an issue.  I\u2019m sure, at the time, it made some family members on both sides happy.  Didn\u2019t hurt nor influence the kid, now 22, one bit.", "I would explain to the grandfather you are not Catholic and want to wait until your son is old enough to make his own commitment to God. Offer for him to write a letter to your son explaining why baptism is so important to him and you\u2019ll pass it along when the time is right. You are not the AH but see if you can handle the situation with a little grace. I would not have him baptized just to appease his grandfather. It should be more meaning than that.", "NTA.

Your FiL is dying, I don\u2019t think you need to worry on his account as it soon won\u2019t matter to him.

My ex and I moved to the South and found a Church.  I was somewhat against going to Church, but my ex decided he really wanted to.  I finally gave in.  So we found one, and made some friends.  I'll admit I drank the Kool aid a bit, and the ex and I got baptized at that church.  I never told the Baptist church I was already baptized as a Catholic.

We lie to dying people all the time, why not a baptism you have no plans of following up on with actual education? \n\nI'm Christian so maybe my opinion is invalid, but when we had our babies baptized, it was less about the baby and more about us promising to raise the baby the way God wanted us to.

Baptism in each denomination can be very different.  \n\nA Catholic would not accept baptism in a different tradition, since they believe that baptism is an actual spiritual event, not a metaphor or symbol of faith.

I have no wish to change anyone\u2019s mind, just sharing information because it can then become easier to talk to someone if you can understand why they saying what they are saying. \n\nMany Catholics say that a baptism the person being baptized is cleansed of \u201coriginal sin\u201d. What does that mean? In really basic concept is that we are born without holiness and justice, which humans lost as a birth right after the Adam and Eve fiasco. So being baptized gives us back this holiness.  \n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has \u201c7 Sacraments\u201d or ceremony including baptism.  The ones following baptism would be Reconciliation and Eucharist.   When a child is in the 2nd grade, they are allowed to have this. Reconciliation is the confession of all sins to a priest, so they are \u201cpure of sin\u201d when they take the Eucharist (which is the little bread like cracker they pass out to everyone during mass). Usually most Catholic Churches require the children to take a handful of classes like 3-5 that talks about the church and why we do this and what will happen if they are not already in Sunday school or a Catholic school. \n\nThe next Sacrament is Confirmation.  This typically happens in the 8th grade, but can be done earlier or later.  This is a right of initiation and serves to \"confirm\" a baptized person in their faith.  This is when a person decides if they truly believe in the faith of the Roman Catholic Church and chooses to believe and live in the faith.  Similar to a Bar Mitzvah\n\nSo a baptism just makes the baby holy, and most everyday Catholic believes that if a baby is baptized, but then later accidentally dies from SIDS or something else, they can go straight to heaven, whereas an unbaptised child is an un-holy being and therefore can not go to heaven.   So this is why most everyday Catholics put so much pressure on having babies baptized. And they believe it\u2019s not signing a baby up for the Roman Catholic religion, for that happens with the other sacraments.", "Not the AH but your kid won't give a shit if you dunk him water your wife and mil will feel guilty forever over it I say just do it you don't even have to tell your son it happened I don't see the big deal but I hope it works out", "NTA.

While the head wetting part is important, I think the gathering after the baptism is often more important. Baptisms are usually an opportunity for your community (i.e., family and friends) to gather together,  give you and your baby good wishes for a healthy and happy future, and tell you how cute your baby looks.  It's a time for hugs and smiles. The world could always use more hugs and smiles, right?", "If you don't believe in it... why not just do the baptism and let them choose later in life anyway.

The entire proposition is silly.", "I\u2019m an atheist (but raised atheist, so I don\u2019t have particularly strong feelings about it, unlike those who\u2019ve had to turn their back on a religion) and am raising my kids with the perspective of \u2018here\u2019s what I think, but I could be wrong\u2019. My kids get exposed to lots of different religions at school. So far, one says he\u2019s Buddhist, and the other is interested in Islam (possibly only *slightly* influenced by the fact that many of their friends got some time off school for Eid recently!). So we\u2019re reading more, and when they\u2019re old enough to engage fully and sit quietly, we\u2019ll be doing some visiting to local temples and mosques. As long as they both turn out to be decent adults behaving kindly and working to make the world a better place, then any belief system they land on will be the right one for them. I\u2019m very aware that I can\u2019t *not influence*! But I want to give them the freedom to explore and ask questions, with the foundation I provide of \u2018everyone is of value, work together to make our world better\u2019.", "Goalkeepers _hate_ crosses", "You can\u2019t ever formally defect from the Catholic Church but you can write your local bishop denouncing Catholicism if you\u2019d like a cathartic exercise to work on.", "I didn't mean it to be rude, but that line of thinking is very immature, why would you \"hate\" that as an infant you had a ceremony that you now find meaningless? It sounds very juvenile and judging from her family claiming that being baptized means you're forever a Catholic i can see where they get the immaturity from.", "Good chat mate", "What do you mean? (eta: not tryna be snarky or anything, I\u2019m genuinely wondering what you mean)", "Thanks!", "Na it's just stupid to baptize a baby and then bring it up when they're 24 and don't care about the church anymore", "There used to be an idea of \"limbo\" -- where unbaptized babies go.  It was never official Catholic doctrine, but the idea had been around for centuries. It became controversial in the 20th century, and was finally quietly eliminated from catechisms in the 1990s. In 2007, Pope Benedict officially called it a \"theory\" rather than an actual doctrine.", "No they decided that wasn\u2019t real anymore.", "Just a guess - you\u2019re in one of the Nordic countries?", "Yeah that is what I was thinking, it depends on the country where you live but there are many countries where the baptism is like a welcome to the world party for baby, more of a cultural thing (even though it is obviously associated with religion). \n\nLike there are national holidays for religious days, you get the day off work but that doesn\u00b4t mean everyone is forced to go to church that day or even knows the original story behind the holiday. People take the holiday as a traditional thing if they are not religious (and who doesn\u00b4t like a day off work anyway).", "Sounds like Germany. They have a confirmation party with gifts and a celebration.", "Because it's not his choice? If I had a kid I wouldn't want them to baptised or inducted into any religion as a child, but if they wanted to join one as they got older I would fully support and respect them and their choice. But that is the kicker, they are of an age where they would be able to understand the choice. As a kid they aren't, and may just go along with it to make their family happy.", "Atheism isn't a religion, but it is certainly a belief system and atheist or agnostic parents, no matter what they want to believe, do influence their children about religion heavily.", "You're welcome!", "Might be stupid, but did it actually affect you or will it this baby if their parents are not religious and want their baby to have autonomy? Didn't in my case and my parents did it more so to appease the family considering they weren't religious either, but both my parents family were. All in all, hurt no one as I feel my family thought it easier to do being only prayers and water. I was not made to do anything growing up I did not choose. I would never even know if I didn't ask or was told.", "South Europe!  Religion is a big deal for some. Most just  follow the traditions because even if they dont believe, they like to follow the customs and traditions of their culture.", "It\u2019s the very similar here where I live and I\u2019m from South America \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it\u2019s like getting your daughter\u2019s ears pierced as soon as she\u2019s born, just something you do. In my entire family the only person that even goes to church is my grandma but everyone is baptised lol.", "That's the way it is in Iceland, when we were Christianized as a country we were forced to go through the motions but they couldn't **make** us believe. It stayed like that for the most part and now we just do the rituals for shits and giggles", "As parents we make 100s of choices everyday for children that are not their own. I make the choice to do his hair everyday, he doesn\u2019t like getting it combed, there are ingredients in styling products that who knows? Could potentially end up be harmful to him one day as we\u2019ve found with other products through the years. He may not even like the style or having hair at all, but until he\u2019s at an age where he can reasonably voice what he wants I\u2019m the one that gets to make those choices. & like I said I\u2019m making choices like that that have the potential to be harmful. I don\u2019t see anything harmful in blessing a baby.", "No, it is not! Atheism is the lack of belief in dieties. This is not only not a belief system but also the default programming for all human beings. This argument is absurd. It's no different than saying that a parent is indoctrinating their child in drug culture by not partaking in or exposing their kid to drugs.", "Eastern Europe! Can confirm I got baptised and had my ears pierced pretty much as soon as I got evicted out my mum's belly.", "hey I am from India and we also pierce baby's ears in the first few months of their lives but its regardless of their gender.", "I get where you are coming from but I still disagree. The concept of being inducted into a religion before I could even understand it is extremely upsetting and in some ways offensive to me. But then again I am an atheist and find the idea of organised religion both an ancient relic of the past designed to impart an extra layer of control and to explain natural phenomenon that the people had zero understanding of at the time.", "I was baptized Catholic and forced to become confirmed. I want nothing to go with that religion now, but there is no was for me to formally leave the church on my own. I have not attended mass since I turned 18 and certainly have not given the church any money, but in their eyes (and record books) I am still a Catholic. \n\nDon\u2019t kid yourself that this is just a \u201charmless blessing\u201d."]}
