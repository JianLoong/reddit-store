This is a decision for parents - not grandparents.", "NTA, in my opinion your FIL is using guilt and manipulation to get what he wants. He has almost succeeded by making your wife feel guilty enough that she is prepared to ignore the decision you made as family.", "NTA \nAs a \"raised Catholic\" I HATE that I was baptized as my family says that because of being baptized, I am forever Catholic when I am not religious at all. It pisses me off sooo much cause it wasn't a decision I made. I tell them time and time again that I'm not Catholic and they don't care what I say because\"in God's eyes you are\" no. I hate it. Stand your ground!! Your son will later thank you.", "NTA. You and your wife decided what was morally right for your family. You are not obligated to have sacred religious rites performed on your child simply because a dying uncle is guilt tripping your wife. Stick to your guns.", "NTA. You could lie and say you did to appease him if you want an easy compromise.", "NTA. It's a little more than getting his hair wet, it's bringing him into an entire institution. And that institution is powerful enough to make your wife change her mind. You should definitely tell him no. This feels so incredibly manipulative of your FIL.", "NTA. Your decision what you do/do not want for your child. The fact he's dying doesn't mean he gets whatever he wants. If it was something small and reasonable, maybe a little wiggle room. But baptism is a big thing. In my faith, it's a commitment. I'm not Catholic, but I think they view it somewhat similarly. To make a commitment with no intent to follow through would be making a mockery of the commitment. I don't think FIL is thinking about that part. If he were asking for something like, would you please come to Mass or read the Bible with me, then maybe consider it. But not baptism.", "NTA.  The pair of you decided this before.", "You're not the AH, but you should also step back and look at what is happening. I was baptized but I ended up as an atheist. Being baptized was literally just being dunked in water. I was too young to remember and don't care that it happened. I think if it keeps the peace in the house, you should probably just let them do it, but if this is a really important conviction for you then you should have a serious talk with your wife about why you are so opposed to it. If you are very anti-religion then it makes sense that you are against it, but if you are neutral and don't care about it one way or the other, then your son being baptized won't impact you.", "NTA. I feel for your FIL and his condition, but being on your deathbed does not give you license to strong arm the people around you to do everything you want by calling it a \"dying wish.\" By doing so, your FIL is being manipulative towards you and your wife, knowing that his condition would put pressure on the two of you.\n\nReligious rituals like baptism (and religion itself) are deeply personal, and it is horribly wrong of someone to force someone else to participate in them.", "NTA.  For me (practicing Catholic, by the way) I wouldn\u2019t want to volunteer to be in a situation that makes me a public liar.  The actual rite asks you why are there and you reply to all that you want your child baptized and you later promise to raise the child in the faith.  You will need to find godparents who promise the same.  Some on here are saying who cares if his head gets wet because you don\u2019t believe in it but I wouldn\u2019t do it for your personal integrity and the priest might not allow it anyway.", "NTA. Your wife and you made the decision not to baptize your son, giving him the choice to make that decision himself when he is older. While  I get why you wife wants to do something for her father, if it wasn't an issue before, although this may sound harsh, I don't think he gets to call the shots just because he is now dying. Your wife would not be letting her father down, he should be respecting your wishes as the parents.", "NTA. It would only be right to baptize your son if you and your wife both plan to raise him as a Catholic. Otherwise, it would be a lie.", "NAH. You are N T A for not wanting your son to be baptized. Your wife is N T A for thinking it\u2019s just symbolic and meaningless and worth pleasing her dying father. \n\nWhat about some kind of symbolic baptism? A respected elder in her family (not a religious official) to do a baptism of sorts in the hospital room?  Might be enough to appease all sides.", "NTA, but I am in a similar situation to you and I baptized my kids. I\u2019m an atheist that thinks religion is stupid and causes problems, my wife grew up catholic, but doesn\u2019t go to church. it meant something to her and her parents to have our kids baptized and I was fine with it. I mean, honestly what is the difference? It\u2019s just some made up shit. You could dunk the kid is Diet Coke and say abracadabra and it would have the same impact. Why not keep the peace?", "You realize that any Catholic can baptize your child at any time and you would never know if they didn\u2019t tell you? Your wife could baptize your son with tap water\u2014that is a legitimate baptism\u2014anyone who has been baptized Catholic can baptize anyone else who has not yet been baptized. If you do not believe in God, what difference does it make if the child is baptized, especially if it would give peace to someone who is dying? Being baptized will not prevent him from changing religions when he gets older, nor from choosing not to practice any religion.", "YTA.  I know the snowflake\u2019s won\u2019t agree but it\u2019s such a small thing to ask.  You know it doesn\u2019t mean anything.  They put some water on his forehead and say some words and it\u2019s over. But if it gives your father in law some comfort in his last days, what\u2019s the harm.", "YTA not toward your FIL but toward your wife. It is a joint decision. While you were in agreement in the beginning, now you are not. Why should your view matter more than your wife\u2019s? You need to find joint solution", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not like my dad was a Catholic for any reason besides his parents and my mom wasn't even one. Sigh. Anyone know a good way to get excommunicated these days? NTA\n\nAlso like, I don't sit around disrespecting religious people's beliefs so why do they always seem to get to disrespect mine?", "NAH. *obligatory not religious in anyway*\nthe man is dying. Can\u2019t blame him for asking. Particularly as if his personal belief and in its own way is wanting to provide spiritual security for your child. But tbh, as a non religious person I don\u2019t think it matters. You\u2019re still going to support your child\u2019s right to decide as they get older. Perhaps they\u2019ll be happy they\u2019ll be baptized or perhaps they\u2019ll feel like you let a priest put water on their head. At the end of the day it seems like a small thing to bring a dying man peace IF he has a positive and significant relationship with your family.", "NTA.  In the US, you can't just have a baby baptized Catholic. You have to belong to a parish; you and your wife do not. Maybe you could skirt this issue using your in-laws church. Still, there are classes the parents must take at the parish. You'll be asked about your commitment to raising your child as a Catholic. What could you and your wife say? Seriously, her parents must know their daughter is not a practicing Catholic.", "NTA.\n\nIt won't stop her father from dying, so what's the point? (Being brutal about it.)", "NTA - your opinion here matters more than your FIL's. And now more than ever, after just watching [The Keepers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keepers), I'd never, ever let a child anywhere near any Catholic clergy. An organisation which has so much to enable, cover for, and protect child predators should never be trusted around children.", "NTA. This goes beyond just dunking your kid in some water. You and your wife made a parenting decision together, and if that changes it should be a decision you make together. It can't be just one party changing their mind and deciding that absolutely that's what's going to happen. Talk to her, see what she expects. Is it just the dunking and that's the end of it, or is she now having second thoughts about wanting to be a practising Catholic and expects your family to worship and go to church etc? If it's just the dunking, then it might not be such a big deal to let it happen if it makes her and her family happy and doesn't seem to bother you as you don't believe the ceremony has any tangible meaning for your family.", "And getting the baby baptised is not going to help him into heaven. If hes that devoutly Catholic,  he needs to worry more about his soul than the babies'.  \nBaptists believe in adult baptism for the very reason that the person knows what they are doing.", "Let's get excommunicated!", "Oh that argument grinds my gears. I was called a devil worshipper by my grandmother because I refused to say/lead grace at Thanksgiving one year because I'm pagan. But she insists that because I was baptized I'm catholic even though we're not churchgoing at all", "2nd this. If it's really that important then yeah hold your ground but this 2 year old is not going to remember getting dunked in water. If they grow up to be atheist then they shouldn't care because the ceremony holds no meaning, if they do grow up to be Christian then it is also naturally fine. He's not asking you to take him to Sunday school or get him circumcised or anything else with an impact, this is literally just dunking a baby in some water while an old guy says prayers.", "Also, you might be required to take a few classes so, depending on your father in law\u2019s health, you might run out of time.", "It would not have the same impact! The diet Coke would make the baby all sticky. \ud83d\ude02", "As someone who was baptized catholic as a baby and wished it never happened now that I'm in my 20s I say don't fucking do it.", ">Why should your view matter more than your wife\u2019s?

One yes one no is a no when it comes to serious decisions about children unless you have sole custody.", "This is a do it or don't do it situation. You cannot get half baptized. \n\nAlso, it sounds like the wife is being guilted into it. She is being coerced by a dying man. I think being supportive here means helping the wife understand that it is okay to hold onto her own beliefs and not be guilted into doing something she wouldn't do otherwise.", "What is a joint solution to this? Its either a yes or no. Unfortunately this situation doesn\u2019t have a third option. Unless you higher a fake priest", "Being excommunicated doesn\u2019t get you out of being Catholic though.", "Agreed, can't believe my protestant wh*re mother (joke) allowed it at all! The nerve! As an adult I appreciate kind of that my ex bff's fundamentalist church didn't do it until 7th grade but tbh by then they were all so indoctrinated it hardly mattered anyway.", "FILs opinion does not matter, wife's does", "Fake priest fake priest!"]}
