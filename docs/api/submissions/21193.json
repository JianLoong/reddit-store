It pisses me off sooo much cause it wasn't a decision I made. I tell them time and time again that I'm not Catholic and they don't care what I say because\"in God's eyes you are\" no. I hate it. Stand your ground!! Your son will later thank you.", "NTA. You and your wife decided what was morally right for your family. You are not obligated to have sacred religious rites performed on your child simply because a dying uncle is guilt tripping your wife. Stick to your guns.", "NTA. You could lie and say you did to appease him if you want an easy compromise.", "NTA. It's a little more than getting his hair wet, it's bringing him into an entire institution. And that institution is powerful enough to make your wife change her mind. You should definitely tell him no. This feels so incredibly manipulative of your FIL.", "NTA. Your decision what you do/do not want for your child. The fact he's dying doesn't mean he gets whatever he wants. If it was something small and reasonable, maybe a little wiggle room. But baptism is a big thing. In my faith, it's a commitment. I'm not Catholic, but I think they view it somewhat similarly. To make a commitment with no intent to follow through would be making a mockery of the commitment. I don't think FIL is thinking about that part. If he were asking for something like, would you please come to Mass or read the Bible with me, then maybe consider it. But not baptism.", "NTA.  The pair of you decided this before.", "You're not the AH, but you should also step back and look at what is happening. I was baptized but I ended up as an atheist. Being baptized was literally just being dunked in water. I was too young to remember and don't care that it happened. I think if it keeps the peace in the house, you should probably just let them do it, but if this is a really important conviction for you then you should have a serious talk with your wife about why you are so opposed to it. If you are very anti-religion then it makes sense that you are against it, but if you are neutral and don't care about it one way or the other, then your son being baptized won't impact you.", "NTA. I feel for your FIL and his condition, but being on your deathbed does not give you license to strong arm the people around you to do everything you want by calling it a \"dying wish.\" By doing so, your FIL is being manipulative towards you and your wife, knowing that his condition would put pressure on the two of you.\n\nReligious rituals like baptism (and religion itself) are deeply personal, and it is horribly wrong of someone to force someone else to participate in them.", "NTA.  For me (practicing Catholic, by the way) I wouldn\u2019t want to volunteer to be in a situation that makes me a public liar.  The actual rite asks you why are there and you reply to all that you want your child baptized and you later promise to raise the child in the faith.  You will need to find godparents who promise the same.  Some on here are saying who cares if his head gets wet because you don\u2019t believe in it but I wouldn\u2019t do it for your personal integrity and the priest might not allow it anyway.", "NTA. Your wife and you made the decision not to baptize your son, giving him the choice to make that decision himself when he is older. While  I get why you wife wants to do something for her father, if it wasn't an issue before, although this may sound harsh, I don't think he gets to call the shots just because he is now dying.

It can't be just one party changing their mind and deciding that absolutely that's what's going to happen. Talk to her, see what she expects.

If it's really that important then yeah hold your ground but this 2 year old is not going to remember getting dunked in water. If they grow up to be atheist then they shouldn't care because the ceremony holds no meaning, if they do grow up to be Christian then it is also naturally fine.

Nothing wrong with not wanting your child to be groomed and indoctrinated.", "As a Catholic I\u2019m saying NTA. He\u2019s asking you to make false promises to raise the child Catholic. If your wife isn\u2019t willing to really make that commitment than it\u2019s for show.", "NTA.  It\u2019s definitely the parents\u2019 decision.  It sounds like your in-laws are Catholic, and if that\u2019s the case, it would be difficult to impossible to find a priest or deacon to baptize against the express wishes of the parents.  Having a dying grandparent who wants to see a child baptized is not sufficient reason, as difficult and painful as that is.  \nIt\u2019s true that in times past (particularly in the last century) children would surreptitiously be baptized, but this practice really flouted the rules and intent of the sacrament.  Since then, the Catholic Church in the US has really cracked down on such.  I think some Catholics haven\u2019t quite caught up.  \nFrom a believer\u2019s perspective (like mine), baptizing a child whose parents are not believers or who have no intention of raising the child in the faith is actually dangerous.  Spiritually speaking, claiming a child for Christ and then abandoning them leaves that child spiritually vulnerable.  \nThe faith of the parents is paramount in this sacrament when it\u2019s a child being baptized.  \nI think you are generally on solid reasoning here, but for the sake of peace and love at this difficult time, I suggest staying away from flip references to your in-laws\u2019 faith (ie, getting his hair wet to appease a dying man).  You can acknowledge the depth and significance of what they\u2019re asking while still rightly rejecting it.", "NTA. Fuck no nobody gets to tell me what to do with my kid and religion. Tell your wife no means no.", "YTA, if you're an atheist then what does it matter? It's like a ceremony to make a loved one happy that means nothing to you", "Personally...I don't think you should.  The only reason you would be doing it is to appease a dying man's wish, so there would be no 'faith' behind the action.  A fib, a kind fib, but a fib nonetheless.  So just tell grandpa that you had little jimmy baptized.  It's still nothing more than the same fib just from a different angle.  Finally...being a recovering former Catholic myself, it's unlikely the church would baptize a child unless at least one of you was a practicing member of a given congregation.  I know you're just trying to lessen a dying man's burden...just tell him a white lie so he can pass quietly.", "If you decide to get your son baptized, you don't have to go through the Catholic Church to do so. Other churches have baptism ceremonies. My grandma was always upset that her great granddaughter wasn't baptized.\n\nSo, if it makes your wife happy to give her father some peace of mind before he dies, why not do it? At least it wouldn't hurt to look into it. I'm speaking as an atheist, for what it's worth.", "It\u2019s just a little water and people with weird customs. It\u2019s not going to harm the baby.

You\u2019re NTA but just do it", "I'm gonna say YTA because this isn't a hill to die on and giving in keeps the peace. Being baptized as a baby doesn't determine your son's religious beliefs. He's getting dunked in some water to make your wife's family happy and save her and you a bunch of drama. You think your inlaws will let you live it down if your FIL dies without seeing his grandson baptized? Your son can still choose what to believe when he gets older. I was baptized and now I'm an atheist. It affected nothing.", "It seems like a pretty small sacrifice to make your in-laws happy. I would probably just do the baptism.", "If Jesus isn\u2019t real, then what harm would come of having a man in a dress put some water on your kid\u2019s head. Do it for the old man.

Just the ones that think the baby will go to hell if it dies unbaptized. The church I grew up in required the person being baptized to be old enough to understand what it meant and consent to have it done. Same to become a member of the church. Same to take communion (which was open to all, not just members). No longer Christian at all, but I would never have agreed to baptism of a child too young to understand.", "Maybe NTA. I was baptized, did it make an impact in my life, I'd say no. Did I sell my soul to a higher power, I don't believe so. It is just water poured onto a baby's head, give it a bath, water falls. If you do not believe anyways in religion what is some water and prayers that will not do a thing hurt a person. Later on. Your child can decide. Again will the baptism change the baby's path, happiness, political view, thoughts, feelings. But if it is a hill you are willing to die on. Then it is definitely your choice.", "NTA - that is not his call to make, and death is not an opportunity to overstep your bounds in the lives of those you leave behind.\n\nYour wife should be more concerned about forcing you to agree to something for your child to please others. **Being a good parent should be her priority over being a good child.** Her parents have already done their parenting.", "NTA. Don\u2019t buy into this misogynist BS. \nI know it\u2019s just water on the head but when will attitudes change.

I used to live in the Philippines, where my daughter was born to my Filipina wife.  My daughter was baptized but then raised non-religious.  The baptism has never been an issue.  I\u2019m sure, at the time, it made some family members on both sides happy.  Didn\u2019t hurt nor influence the kid, now 22, one bit.", "I would explain to the grandfather you are not Catholic and want to wait until your son is old enough to make his own commitment to God. Offer for him to write a letter to your son explaining why baptism is so important to him and you\u2019ll pass it along when the time is right. You are not the AH but see if you can handle the situation with a little grace. I would not have him baptized just to appease his grandfather. It should be more meaning than that.", "NTA.

Your FiL is dying, I don\u2019t think you need to worry on his account as it soon won\u2019t matter to him.

My ex and I moved to the South and found a Church.  I was somewhat against going to Church, but my ex decided he really wanted to.  I finally gave in.  So we found one, and made some friends.  I'll admit I drank the Kool aid a bit, and the ex and I got baptized at that church.  I never told the Baptist church I was already baptized as a Catholic.

We lie to dying people all the time, why not a baptism you have no plans of following up on with actual education? \n\nI'm Christian so maybe my opinion is invalid, but when we had our babies baptized, it was less about the baby and more about us promising to raise the baby the way God wanted us to.

Baptism in each denomination can be very different.  \n\nA Catholic would not accept baptism in a different tradition, since they believe that baptism is an actual spiritual event, not a metaphor or symbol of faith.

I have no wish to change anyone\u2019s mind, just sharing information because it can then become easier to talk to someone if you can understand why they saying what they are saying. \n\nMany Catholics say that a baptism the person being baptized is cleansed of \u201coriginal sin\u201d. What does that mean? In really basic concept is that we are born without holiness and justice, which humans lost as a birth right after the Adam and Eve fiasco. So being baptized gives us back this holiness.  \n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has \u201c7 Sacraments\u201d or ceremony including baptism.  The ones following baptism would be Reconciliation and Eucharist.   When a child is in the 2nd grade, they are allowed to have this. Reconciliation is the confession of all sins to a priest, so they are \u201cpure of sin\u201d when they take the Eucharist (which is the little bread like cracker they pass out to everyone during mass). Usually most Catholic Churches require the children to take a handful of classes like 3-5 that talks about the church and why we do this and what will happen if they are not already in Sunday school or a Catholic school. \n\nThe next Sacrament is Confirmation.  This typically happens in the 8th grade, but can be done earlier or later.  This is a right of initiation and serves to \"confirm\" a baptized person in their faith.  This is when a person decides if they truly believe in the faith of the Roman Catholic Church and chooses to believe and live in the faith.  Similar to a Bar Mitzvah\n\nSo a baptism just makes the baby holy, and most everyday Catholic believes that if a baby is baptized, but then later accidentally dies from SIDS or something else, they can go straight to heaven, whereas an unbaptised child is an un-holy being and therefore can not go to heaven.   So this is why most everyday Catholics put so much pressure on having babies baptized. And they believe it\u2019s not signing a baby up for the Roman Catholic religion, for that happens with the other sacraments.", "Not the AH but your kid won't give a shit if you dunk him water your wife and mil will feel guilty forever over it I say just do it you don't even have to tell your son it happened I don't see the big deal but I hope it works out", "NTA.

While the head wetting part is important, I think the gathering after the baptism is often more important. Baptisms are usually an opportunity for your community (i.e., family and friends) to gather together,  give you and your baby good wishes for a healthy and happy future, and tell you how cute your baby looks.  It's a time for hugs and smiles. The world could always use more hugs and smiles, right?", "If you don't believe in it... why not just do the baptism and let them choose later in life anyway.

We\u2019re all in our 30s-40s now and figured out what our beliefs are having not been raised with any and we all ended up with different beliefs as a result.", "Depending on the country the church considers you a (lifelong) member and can ask money from the government based on membership numbers. You could have yourself excommunicated.", "I tried to compromise with that initially and she wanted a longer one so I refused", "Lol I love it", "That doesn\u2019t mean the FIL gets to make these decisions. Just because he is a religious nut who condemns children to hell doesn\u2019t mean people should just bend to his beliefs. Dying or not, he should mind his own business and worry about his supposed afterlife.", "They don't know I'm anti. Just less educated immigrants with traditional beliefs. \n\nAs I said in the end i realised I wasn't affected as much as they would be so made the choice to allow it and not cause my wife family trouble.", "Stillborn ones that the parents couldn't baptize, not toddlers that the parents wouldn't baptize", "It's still a way for the catholic church to manifest their existence. You can easily celebrate children without a priest involved.", "Yeah, and the Church will count that as a win. It will say the number of Catholics is this high when it's actually the number of baptised babies. I live in one of those countries too. My child's consent will be respected.", "Unless you live in a country with zero Jews, no, not everyone gets baptized.", "It's always interesting how long it takes for traditions with very specific meanings to become pro forma, and then to just have that meaning disappear or the tradition itself to go away.", "I know you mean well, but I am someone who was baptized as a Catholic as a baby. I grew up to be an atheist with pagan-influenced spiritual beliefs, and I see the baptism to be a bad thing which frequently inconveniences me. No matter how politely I express my religious beliefs, my \"loving family\" persistently counters by telling me I am being satanic because I was baptized by the Catholic church and everything I do is an affront to their teachings. They literally think it would be fine if I hadn't been baptized, because in that case I wouldn't be breaking my \"commitment\" to the church - but I had no choice to be baptized, and I never chose that commitment! I know you may not be Catholic so this may not apply to you, but in OP's case it sounds like they would be doing a Catholic baptism.\n\nI hope this perspective is helpful - it's not necessarily the baptism that's the problem, but the fact that different family members have different expectations of what being baptized means that can cause them to put pressure on your child, even if you personally are supportive.", "Christening and baptizing are, iirc, different things? I can't recall what the difference is, except that christening is specifically only for babies/children. At least, that's what I've been told.\n\nLike a friend of mine was christened because her dad was religious but her mom wasn't, so it was a way to prevent her from going to Purgatory or something, if she died before she could decide on her own faith, but not specifically dedicating her to a religion.\n\nI don't understand religion on basic principle (too autistic? Idk man, it never made sense to me, even as a kid) so I could be completely incorrect.", "I'm agnostic in the, \"You can't prove or disprove the existence of a God or Gods,\" sense, and have in the past claimed atheism as my own, and I have to say, Christian Atheists are the most annoying.\n\nAnd yes, they exist. We don't like acknowledging it but the US is heavily driven by a type of Christian cultural values and we are, culturally, a Christian nation. If you grew up in a household in the US, you likely have a lot of Christian shit kicking around in your head you haven't even realized. Yes, even if you are Jewish or Muslim or literally anything. It's societal socialization, your parents don't control it, society as a whole does.\n\nExamples of things that are US Christian values that are baked into our society as social mores (although these are not specific to ONLY US Christianity):\n\nThe concept of purity\nInspiration porn\nThe glorification of suffering\nRight vs wrong and not the shades of gray in between\nJustice codes that apply broadly to every situation regardless of how un-similar they are\nEquating one's value to one's ability to contribute (Jesus may have loved the poor, but the Bible sure seems to pity them in a very unkind way) \n\nSo yeah, we have Christian Atheists and they are *so fucking annoying*. And they *always* react like this when someone mentions atheism being a spiritual system.\n\nLike yes, technically, you're kinda correct, but that's splitting hairs in the most annoying fucking way possible. Being pedantic just makes you look like an asshole.\n\nTldr: religion, and the lack thereof, are still all considered religion because religion is how humans handle matters of spirituality - even if that's by refusing to engage.", "I was petty and brought a list of Christmas traditions that were stolen from the pagan traditions. I was left alone after that", "Because even if I don't believe in their god, those who do will still see me as part of their religion or w/e.\n\n- an \u00c1satr\u00faar who was christened/baptised as a baby", "That is... Incredibly cruel. This is likely a man who is legitimately scared for his grandchild. He's not condemning him, but he believes his God is. Whether that's true or not doesn't matter: he believes it is, and that makes it scary for him. He's dying and his thoughts are dwelling on where one goes when one dies. It's natural that he'd start to feel concerned for a kid with no protection (in his mind, anyway), should the worst happen. Like. Fuck. At least give a person you don't know in the slightest a shred of the benefit of the doubt before you immediately cast him as The Worst Person Ever for caring about his grandchild's \"immortal soul.\"\n\nI'm not religious but I have basic-ass *compassion*. Fucking hell.", "No. I took part in marriage just for show and they seem to think that's a big deal? I don't care. Marriage, and baptism, are ceremonies in tons of religions. They don't have like, a claim on it. Plus they engage in sham shit all the time. *gestures at the Vatican as a whole* \n\nIf it's real, the parents suffer in hell. That's kind of a them problem. If it's not real, no one loses and a man dies feeling like his grandson is saved.\n\nI'm trying to have compassion here because I don't like the idea of baptism as a concept, and especially for infants, but I cannot help but laugh at the idea of trying to keep catholic rites sacred. They used to sell indulgences, Sarah. One Pope had like eight children and a papal army he used to slaughter thousands. The current-day church is directly responsible for the previous and current AIDS crises. None of this is more or less sacred than anything else when it comes to religion, and the Catholic Church is probably the least of most.", "To be fair, the whole things isn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d. Religion as a whole has very little basis in reality.", "I was raised around the Catholic religion, but not baptized. I was the ONLY one in my family not baptized,", "I'm in Scotland and that was our experience too.", "Christening and baptizing are different words for the same thing. Just different churches might use one word more than the other.\n\nThe 'goal' is to perform the ceremony when they are babies to absolve them of original sin. It was to grant them access to heaven if they died young.\n\nYou can perform the baptism at any time though. In some churches, you only have to go through a baptism to enter into the faith. In the Catholic faith, you have like a few more ceremonies to perform. They usually combine them all together for any adults that were baptized later in life..", "Calling atheism a \"belief system\" is like calling good health \"a type of cancer\".", "Itt: instructions on how to offend the alleged Cool Pope, AND how to get kicked out of the Catholic Church!\n\nReally, though, just by stating that you are not Catholic means you're not Catholic and anyone who says otherwise should be told to read up on what apostate actually means. I reeeeeally pissed odd my grandmother by telling her that. Although my parents never had me christened or baptized or any of that, she thought they had, and I told her to look up the definition of apostasy and what the Church does about it.\n\nI was banned from her house for a year.", "At this point I'm just trying to figure out why do my grandparents want to drag my apostate heretic ass to church at Christmas.", "I\u2019m in seminary at an evangelical school in America, and in one of my classes they had a list of countries that needed more evangelization, aka, more missionaries. Italy was on the list. Italy. The most catholic country on earth, the seat of the pope, the country where you can\u2019t sneeze without hitting four churches and a cathedral. Realized that map was probably BS Protestant nonsense.", "Ugh they even do loud speakers telling them they will burn in hell for all their sins. They even export these lunatics to other countries.", "idk man, we had religion in school that counted into our total grade... the times are changing now, but imo should be the same to stop unnecessary baptizing. \n\nlike, i cannot even get myself out of church's grasp despite being pagan, because our church refuses any excommunication. and i for sure aint paying for their another car to change their minds.\n\npeople shouldn't be forced into a community they cannot easily just walk away from.", "Correct, it\u2019s more of a tradition than a religious thing.", "If he gets offended by the offer of a bj, then is he really the cool pope?", "Actually I don't think they're wrong haha, most people are baptized here because \"it's always been done like that\" but very few are actually religious, and for those who are, religion is something private. There are a lot of fanatics as well of course, but faith is usually not so explicit, which can be weird for Americans. Like, they probably were thinking that Italy needs to be a lot more serious about religion and try to get people to go to church, but it's not our style", "We had one in our small European town!

You are born an atheist the same way you were born not knowing how to speak English. Yes, cultures create religion and language, but these things are learned, not inherited.
