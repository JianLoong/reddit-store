However there is no guarantee she will ever be able to resume her work, at least outside her home. Thousands of dollar's down the drain.", "The ESA numbers are way out of control and far far too many people have pets that they simply *claim* are service animals.  Which makes a lot of people call bullshit and think most of these people are entitled self centered crapbags.", "NTA. And I resent people like this woman. Service animals are a noble concept. They help the patient without a doubt. But they also provide a sense of duty for the animal. Furthermore, it ensures that the animal is cared for. Obviously you still have to feed and provide for it. It ensures a certain quality of life for the dog. \n\nYet people have corrupted this noble concept and insist on taking it to extremes. You can now claim any dog is a service animal. Heck, you can buy rip off collars or harnesses all over the place.", "ESAs are pets with made up titles.

NTA", "NTA don\u2019t touch service dog.", "A tale of two dogs: the other day, at the cafe, a lady had a \u2018service-dog\u2019 but it was sniffing around and reacting to everything.

One is not like the other.", "NTA, he\u2019s fake service dog could have caused real damage to your real one. If your dog had been attacked it could have put him in a position where (s)he could no longer do his job (I have a friend who\u2019s dog had to be retired for this reason as he became dog reactive after a bad attack) and then you are down your medical equipment, whatever money you paid to have him trained, and the money to train a new one", "let me guess the breed - a pitbull ? irresponsible pitbull owners often say their \"cute widdle velvet hippos\" are ESA because landlords dont want these mauling machines in the house", "Story seems off to me.

And, apparently, she mainly calls her dog a service dog to try and keep the landlord from kicking her out. It\u2019s very possible she doesn\u2019t bother to take proper care of it either, poor dog.", "Nta - they are different. If they were the same they would be called the same thing.", "Why?\n\nThey go through training, too.\n\nIt's nice to know you think people who have severe emotional issues like PTSD for example, don't deserve an emotional support animal to make sure they don't have panic attacks and shit.\n\n\nOr people like me who are on the ASD spectrum who get triggered really quickly in loud and public places should not have trained dogs for emotional support so they can function.", "Here in the state of Texas, a dog growling at a person/animal is designated as a Level 1 Aggressive Dog and there are legal requirements for owning an aggressive dog.\n\nNot odd at all that the person with the service dog was upset at the ignorant azzhat with the aggressive ~~pet~~ ESA.\n\nFurther, ESAs are NOT legally allowed in grocery, restaurants, stores, or in classrooms.", "You want this person to mind their own business when someone\u2019s Emotional Support Animal is growling at their Service Dog?\n\nFirm no.\n\nI have a Service Dog. If our dogs growl at *anyone*, we can legally be denied access and we should be. At that point, our working dogs are posing a risk. That\u2019s not something to ignore. \n\nTo add to this, this woman tried to pet a Service Dog. That\u2019s a firm no on its own. No one should be approaching and trying to pet Service Dogs. That\u2019s a decision that could potentially put a handler\u2019s life at risk.", "A licenced psychiatrist knows nothing about dogs. She did mind her own business, the woman approached her and tried to pat her dog! And getting annoyed when a dog shows unprovoked aggression is totally reasonable. If your dog is poorly trained, that is on you. Plenty of people have trauma from dogs and don\u2019t want shittily behaved dogs approaching them and growling at them.", "In the US, ESAs have no public access rights at all. A letter from a doctor makes no difference - all it does is allow you to have your animal in a non-pet housing unit and to not have to pay a pet deposit or fees for that. Any website that tries to say anything to the contrary is either a scam selling certificates that have no validity whatsoever or very poorly informed about service dog and ESA laws.\n\nA service animal is VERY different from an ESA. They're specifically trained to do a task to mitigate a disability (that's why there are PSDs, or Psychiatric Service Dogs, as well as ESAs) and they have extensive training for public manners, as well. ESAs offer comfort and support by simply existing and being available for pets. Service dogs do specific things, like alerting to medical issues, retrieving objects for people with mobility problems, or DPT for psych issues, just to name a few.\n\nGrowling and showing teeth are signs of aggression that are NOT appropriate, regardless of whether the dog is a service dog or ESA. I completely understand OPs frustration, as I do more than a little inward eye-rolling over poorly trained dogs myself - sometimes it gets really hard not to say something, especially when someone tries to conflate their poorly trained, yapping Chihuahua that's riding in the basket with my dog that's had hours upon hours of expensive training and quite a bit of effort put into him.", "Dog trainer here. \n\nAn ESA requires 0 training, they also do not have the same rights as service dogs. Service dogs have to fit into a strict regulation to be able to safely provide a needed service for them. ESA do not. Any animal can be classed as a ESA with no training \n\nIn reality you have 0 legal right to take your dog into a supermarket and can be asked to leave. Whereas a service dog has the right to be inside all business.\n\nDon\u2019t pretend your ESA is a service dog. As their not. One is a pet, the other is a service animal which serves a huge purpose.", "They are absolutely not the same. All real service animals are highly trained, display appropriate behaviours and no aggression. You may \u2018deserve\u2019 a dog, you don\u2019t deserve for it to be treated like it\u2019s providing recognised medical/disability services with the proven behaviours to match.", "But if this person's ESA was properly trained, it would presumably not have snarled and growled at the other dog? I think that's the overall point. That this dog was clearly not trained, therefore not likely an actual support animal. Just a pet, with an owner trying to claim these 2 dogs were the same.", "Emotional support animal is just a fancy way to say pet. They don\u2019t require any training. If you need an animal to support you during panic attacks in public you need a *psychiatric service animal* who is trained to handle those types of situations. From one autistic to another, don\u2019t use your autism as a cop out.", "I have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and a Service Dog. The main distinguishing factor is that Service Dogs are taught really specific tasks to help with conditions like that.\n\nFor example, my own will implement a distraction protocol if he can tell I\u2019m going to have a flashback and, if I disassociate or begin to disassociate, he can guide me to my car or an applicable safe space. It\u2019s much more practical than just offering a layer of emotional support. \n\nFor me, the biggest difference would be the level of public access training Service Dogs receive versus that what Emotional Support Animals receive. Our dogs have to behave in very, very specific ways in public spaces. They have to ignore members of the public and pets, they have to remain by our side watching for any symptoms, they have to hold down stays for some significant periods of time\u2026to name a few areas. If there are any issues regarding reactivity of them not taking to the training, they\u2019re washed out or retired. \n\nIf a dog isn\u2019t trained to that level, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll cause problems in areas that aren\u2019t really dog friendly. The dog in this post, in particular, posed a risk. \n\nIf my Service Dog growled at *anything*, I would be legally denied access as he would be deemed out of control. That\u2019s a huge thing that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Dogs that are reactive in this way can\u2019t be working dogs in this type of environment.", "Actually, you're incorrect. ESAs do NOT go through any required training.  Some animals can't be trained and are only ESA because they're cute and fluffy - comforting to be held.", "Having a service animal for emotional needs \u2260 an emotional support animal. Service animals have specific training, ESAs do not and unfortunately are rarely trained to the same standards (see OPs example of the ESA growling). I'm guessing this is just a terminology mix up, people who need service animals for autism or PTSD as examples absolutely should be allowed them, and they are just as essential as service dogs for physical issues. /nm", "Dogs trained well enough to be reliable are serving their owner. Dogs who are just there to offer emotional comfort do not have the training to effectively prevent a medical emergency. I have autism and a meltdown isn't the same as understanding when someone is having arrhythmia, low blood sugar, or is about to have a seizure. The dogs who need to pay attention cannot be messed with by being petted, an emotional support dog can be comforting even if it's distracted, because your bond means they'll be concerned for you... but they're not the same thing.", "A psychiatric service dog that warns of panic attacks and does deep pressure therapy or other medically helpful services is not the same thing as an emotional support animal. Similarly, service dogs for people on the ASD spectrum are a great thing - not an untrained aggressive dog that \"supports\" just by being cute", "\u201cEmotional support animals\u201d are absolutely NOT formally trained for medical service except how their owners train them. They are NOT recognized by any of the laws that protect actual service animals. Because they are just Pets that a person says they need to have to feel better. \n\nYour comment where someone medically has a need for a service animal-  does have every right to have one. No one is saying that your example doesn\u2019t deserve a working  service animal - but you have to go actually get a real one! Not just pick any random dog you want and say \u201cthis is a service dog\u201d it is not.", "Your examples are both service dogs for neurodivergent issues. An ESA is different, and can receive the label with something like a letter from a therapist - effective if your apartment complex says you can't keep your dog, but not authorizing your dog to go to the grocery store or on an airplane. ESA dogs are not required to be trained to provide a service.", "No they dont, the dog being aggressive means no training. You can straight up buy an ESA certificate for like 50$. ESA are not as expensive as actual Service animals.", "https://www.ada.gov/topics/service-animals/\n\nAn emotional support dog is not inherently a service dog. A service dog is specifically trained to complete a set task under set circumstances, it is not there to just make you feel better by being a comfort to you.", "Sweetie, the psychiatrist, does mental health evaluations to see if an ESA is the right treatment for the patient.", "Correct me please if wrong but thought dogs for people with PTSD/panic attacks could be service dogs because they are trained to lie across people to offer greater support and trained to refocus attention from situation to them. Knew two veterans with them for that reason.\n\nAs compared to an emotional service dog which has no task (or usually advanced behaviourial) training but offers comfort by presence alone.", "Go look at my comment I posted earlier, please.", "Also ESA\u2019s can be any animal. But only dogs and miniature horses can be trained as service animals. At least in the USA. I think some European countries also allow cats as proper service animals but I\u2019m not sure.", "Yes, but an emotional support animal is NOT a service animal. A service animal is trained to do a TASK... like pick up a bottle of pills, alert me to a diabetic low or a knock on the door, provide stability if I fall and need help getting up.\n\nA mental health expert determines if an emotional support animal can be of benefit to the patient and then must write a letter stating as much.  The mental health expert does nothing beyond the letter/verification of the condition of the patient. It is up to the patient to determine what animal.  The animal (any animal can be an ESA but only dogs can be a Service Animal ETA: actually, miniature horses can be guides for the blind) can be a pre-existing pet and be untrained.  A service dog is trained... not just in its specific task, but also in being in public spaces and around people.\n\nAlso, NO animal is supposed to be in a grocery cart.\n\nSweetie.", "You\u2019re right! I have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and a Psychiatric Service Dog. \n\nHe\u2019s trained to do specific tasks that help to mitigate and manage my symptoms. For example, guiding me to a safe space or my car if I begin to disassociate from my surroundings. \n\nIt\u2019s a really practical level of support.", "You're correct. PSDs are service dogs no less than mobility dogs, guide dogs, or medical alert dogs. All of them are trained to do specific tasks that mitigate a disability that the handler has, like the DPT you mentioned.", "I did, it does not change my opinion.", "The ADA stopped allowing miniature horses as service animals a little more than ten years back, I believe.", "Just to add that anxiety reduction is also a task that a service dog can perform, but requires training for specifically that purpose. The dog is not considered a pet, but a working dog.", "Ok.", "[Nope, Still allowed for use as assistance animals, it\u2019s just a separate clause](https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-2010-requirements/)\nNot called service animals but basically legally protected as service animals still."]}
