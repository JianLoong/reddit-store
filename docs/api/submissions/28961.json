If our dogs growl at *anyone*, we can legally be denied access and we should be. At that point, our working dogs are posing a risk. That\u2019s not something to ignore. \n\nTo add to this, this woman tried to pet a Service Dog. That\u2019s a firm no on its own. No one should be approaching and trying to pet Service Dogs. That\u2019s a decision that could potentially put a handler\u2019s life at risk.", "A licenced psychiatrist knows nothing about dogs. She did mind her own business, the woman approached her and tried to pat her dog! And getting annoyed when a dog shows unprovoked aggression is totally reasonable. If your dog is poorly trained, that is on you. Plenty of people have trauma from dogs and don\u2019t want shittily behaved dogs approaching them and growling at them.", "In the US, ESAs have no public access rights at all. A letter from a doctor makes no difference - all it does is allow you to have your animal in a non-pet housing unit and to not have to pay a pet deposit or fees for that. Any website that tries to say anything to the contrary is either a scam selling certificates that have no validity whatsoever or very poorly informed about service dog and ESA laws.\n\nA service animal is VERY different from an ESA. They're specifically trained to do a task to mitigate a disability (that's why there are PSDs, or Psychiatric Service Dogs, as well as ESAs) and they have extensive training for public manners, as well. ESAs offer comfort and support by simply existing and being available for pets. Service dogs do specific things, like alerting to medical issues, retrieving objects for people with mobility problems, or DPT for psych issues, just to name a few.\n\nGrowling and showing teeth are signs of aggression that are NOT appropriate, regardless of whether the dog is a service dog or ESA. I completely understand OPs frustration, as I do more than a little inward eye-rolling over poorly trained dogs myself - sometimes it gets really hard not to say something, especially when someone tries to conflate their poorly trained, yapping Chihuahua that's riding in the basket with my dog that's had hours upon hours of expensive training and quite a bit of effort put into him.", "Dog trainer here. \n\nAn ESA requires 0 training, they also do not have the same rights as service dogs. Service dogs have to fit into a strict regulation to be able to safely provide a needed service for them. ESA do not. Any animal can be classed as a ESA with no training \n\nIn reality you have 0 legal right to take your dog into a supermarket and can be asked to leave. Whereas a service dog has the right to be inside all business.\n\nDon\u2019t pretend your ESA is a service dog. As their not. One is a pet, the other is a service animal which serves a huge purpose.", "They are absolutely not the same. All real service animals are highly trained, display appropriate behaviours and no aggression. You may \u2018deserve\u2019 a dog, you don\u2019t deserve for it to be treated like it\u2019s providing recognised medical/disability services with the proven behaviours to match.", "But if this person's ESA was properly trained, it would presumably not have snarled and growled at the other dog? I think that's the overall point. That this dog was clearly not trained, therefore not likely an actual support animal. Just a pet, with an owner trying to claim these 2 dogs were the same.", "Emotional support animal is just a fancy way to say pet. They don\u2019t require any training. If you need an animal to support you during panic attacks in public you need a *psychiatric service animal* who is trained to handle those types of situations. From one autistic to another, don\u2019t use your autism as a cop out.", "I have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and a Service Dog. The main distinguishing factor is that Service Dogs are taught really specific tasks to help with conditions like that.\n\nFor example, my own will implement a distraction protocol if he can tell I\u2019m going to have a flashback and, if I disassociate or begin to disassociate, he can guide me to my car or an applicable safe space. It\u2019s much more practical than just offering a layer of emotional support. \n\nFor me, the biggest difference would be the level of public access training Service Dogs receive versus that what Emotional Support Animals receive. Our dogs have to behave in very, very specific ways in public spaces. They have to ignore members of the public and pets, they have to remain by our side watching for any symptoms, they have to hold down stays for some significant periods of time\u2026to name a few areas. If there are any issues regarding reactivity of them not taking to the training, they\u2019re washed out or retired. \n\nIf a dog isn\u2019t trained to that level, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll cause problems in areas that aren\u2019t really dog friendly. The dog in this post, in particular, posed a risk. \n\nIf my Service Dog growled at *anything*, I would be legally denied access as he would be deemed out of control. That\u2019s a huge thing that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Dogs that are reactive in this way can\u2019t be working dogs in this type of environment.", "Actually, you're incorrect. ESAs do NOT go through any required training.  Some animals can't be trained and are only ESA because they're cute and fluffy - comforting to be held.", "Having a service animal for emotional needs \u2260 an emotional support animal. Service animals have specific training, ESAs do not and unfortunately are rarely trained to the same standards (see OPs example of the ESA growling). I'm guessing this is just a terminology mix up, people who need service animals for autism or PTSD as examples absolutely should be allowed them, and they are just as essential as service dogs for physical issues. /nm", "Dogs trained well enough to be reliable are serving their owner. Dogs who are just there to offer emotional comfort do not have the training to effectively prevent a medical emergency. I have autism and a meltdown isn't the same as understanding when someone is having arrhythmia, low blood sugar, or is about to have a seizure. The dogs who need to pay attention cannot be messed with by being petted, an emotional support dog can be comforting even if it's distracted, because your bond means they'll be concerned for you... but they're not the same thing.", "A psychiatric service dog that warns of panic attacks and does deep pressure therapy or other medically helpful services is not the same thing as an emotional support animal. Similarly, service dogs for people on the ASD spectrum are a great thing - not an untrained aggressive dog that \"supports\" just by being cute", "\u201cEmotional support animals\u201d are absolutely NOT formally trained for medical service except how their owners train them. They are NOT recognized by any of the laws that protect actual service animals. Because they are just Pets that a person says they need to have to feel better. \n\nYour comment where someone medically has a need for a service animal-  does have every right to have one.

An ESA is different, and can receive the label with something like a letter from a therapist - effective if your apartment complex says you can't keep your dog, but not authorizing your dog to go to the grocery store or on an airplane. ESA dogs are not required to be trained to provide a service.", "No they dont, the dog being aggressive means no training. You can straight up buy an ESA certificate for like 50$. ESA are not as expensive as actual Service animals.", "https://www.ada.gov/topics/service-animals/\n\nAn emotional support dog is not inherently a service dog. A service dog is specifically trained to complete a set task under set circumstances, it is not there to just make you feel better by being a comfort to you.", "Sweetie, the psychiatrist, does mental health evaluations to see if an ESA is the right treatment for the patient.", "Correct me please if wrong but thought dogs for people with PTSD/panic attacks could be service dogs because they are trained to lie across people to offer greater support and trained to refocus attention from situation to them. Knew two veterans with them for that reason.\n\nAs compared to an emotional service dog which has no task (or usually advanced behaviourial) training but offers comfort by presence alone.", "Go look at my comment I posted earlier, please.", "Also ESA\u2019s can be any animal. But only dogs and miniature horses can be trained as service animals. At least in the USA. I think some European countries also allow cats as proper service animals but I\u2019m not sure.", "Yes, but an emotional support animal is NOT a service animal. A service animal is trained to do a TASK... like pick up a bottle of pills, alert me to a diabetic low or a knock on the door, provide stability if I fall and need help getting up.\n\nA mental health expert determines if an emotional support animal can be of benefit to the patient and then must write a letter stating as much.  The mental health expert does nothing beyond the letter/verification of the condition of the patient. It is up to the patient to determine what animal.  The animal (any animal can be an ESA but only dogs can be a Service Animal ETA: actually, miniature horses can be guides for the blind) can be a pre-existing pet and be untrained.  A service dog is trained... not just in its specific task, but also in being in public spaces and around people.\n\nAlso, NO animal is supposed to be in a grocery cart.\n\nSweetie.", "You\u2019re right!

PSDs are service dogs no less than mobility dogs, guide dogs, or medical alert dogs.

That\u2019s a service but it doesn\u2019t make her a service dog. I absolutely never take her into stores besides Petsmart and I sure as shit don\u2019t act like her existence entitles me to pet actual service dogs. NTA, keep it up. I cannot stand these ESA assholes who end up making life harder for people with legit service animals.", "NTA, people claiming ponies, monkeys , peacocks, and more as ESA is an excuse to game the system.", "The biggest difference between a service dog and an ESA- and the reason a service dog is treated as medical equipment with access most places you go and an ESA isn\u2019t- is tasks. A service dog performs tasks to help mitigate your disability and an ESA doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s part of the reason the two questions a business or other entity is allowed to ask are \u201cis it a service dog\u201d and \u201cwhat tasks does it perform for you\u201d. \n\nYour dog functions as medical equipment and hers doesn\u2019t. The fact that she had it in a cart is one big sign that it was more of an accessory to her than a helper. And she deserved to be chewed out! Honestly, I would have lectured her the first moment she tried to touch my dog- I have a seizure response dog. And I would have alerted management that she had a dog that did not have legal access to a supermarket when she went in. \n\nUgh.

I have emotional support animals for my anxiety, and RULE NUMBER ONE is that they are not the same as a service animal!!! There's a *reason* ESAs do not get the same privileges as service animals. One can certainly get a service animal and train it to deal with mental health response, but you were (reasonably) upset because her dog was not acting trained and might've been distracting your dog from it's job (big yikes, big liability to you and all involved.) She should really get schooled on what an ESA is actually for, because it's not for taking your pets in public.", "NTA My kitties are wonderful for my autistic children however this does not, and should not give us any special rights. All pets fulfil a need in us, or we wouldn't have them. It annoys me that some people use animals to fulfil their needs with no consideration for the animals needs or other people. Examples would be taking animals on flights.", "No training is required for an ESA, but many do have it. My ESA does not qualify as a service animal because of his species. So, I cannot take him out in public. But, he is trained to perform tasks that can literally save my life. But, he\u2019s a cat, so he doesn\u2019t get access to most public places. This does make it so I have issues accessing public spaces alone. Just Friday I had an anxiety attack at the grocery store because it was too loud and crowded for me. Husband was at work and kid was at school. I had no choice but to go alone. Needed stuff for dinner and to pick up kid\u2019s meds. It fucking sucked. \n\nBut, I know my cat would have hated being in public (he is barely tolerating my husband now and that has taken 5 years), he doesn\u2019t like people except my family. It does give me access to not having to pay \u201cpet rent\u201d and other fees. He is trained, just not for public service. And I get that.\n\nI hate when people bring clearly untrained or non-dog animals in public. It makes everyone who has legitimate ESAs look bad. My mom tried for awhile to claim her dog was a service animal because she uses it as an ESA (her doctor did prescribe an ESA, but my mom never did anything to train the dog. Now she has two. My mother has never helped train any dog my family has owned in my 46 years of life. Grr). That thing jumps on people, and generally behaves like a wild animal. I hate it. It puts a negative light on everyone and is one day going to get people with legitimate issues and needs their access taken away. \n\nOP- NTA \n\nPeople need to stop abusing the system so it doesn\u2019t get taken away.\n\nAnd for anyone wondering, yes we have considered a PSD for me so there would be less issues like the other day, but it is costly and my husband and I aren\u2019t really dog people.

And entitled behavior like that is how people with legitimate service animals get turned away. \n\nWhether or not a person has a prescription from a licensed psychiatrist, they have no business bringing an unsocialized, aggressive animal in public.", "Nobody messes with me when I'm out with my emotional support honey badger...", "I actually read earlier today. Somebody was looking at a ball python for emotional support animal. Excuse me?", "I\u2019m on the ASD spectrum and really can\u2019t handle shops at all without headphones - maybe you should look into those. I\u2019d love nothing more than an emotional support cat, but I\u2019d *never* take it with me to a shop or another place I know they aren\u2019t supposed to be. \n\nThe reasons for why the ban on pets is exempt for service dogs and not emotional support dogs are: \n\n1) People may be allergic with severities ranging from the sniffles/mild rash to *anaphylaxis* - that\u2019s right, a *deadly* reaction in which the airways tighten to the point that the individual could die if not given an Epi pen or taken to a hospital. So your dog/cat/whatever is increasing the risk to these people, regardless of their presence in the store at that same moment or not, because your pet\u2019s fur could end up on all manner of merchandise, which is especially bad in food aisles like the fruits and veggies, where it could get directly onto them and be ingested or breathed in. It\u2019s not just people in your immediate vicinity who your pet affects. The less unnecessary animal fur is exposed in these surroundings, the better. \n\n2) untrained dogs are specifically not good to have inside stores, especially when service dogs are around. Look, emotional support animals are important, just not *as* important as service dogs - you aren\u2019t going to risk dropping down dead if you leave your support dog outside for like 10-20 minutes while you grab some bread and milk. Someone with diabetes or seizures, however, *do* run that risk. That risk also occurs when untrained dogs like the one in this post distract service dogs from their tasks, or when dumb humans, like the one in the post, likewise distract the dog by trying to pet them. Not to mention, some people are literally blind without their service dogs and rely on them for visual or hearing aid, and a person or dog distracting them could cause their human to be in danger. Not to mention, if your support dog acts aggressively or constantly troubles others, you are ruining the image not for emotional support dogs, but *all* service dogs, which only further causes harm to service dogs and their owners in terms of acceptance and understanding by the public. \n\n3) Dogs are unhygienic. No matter how often you wash your dog, they\u2019re walking germ machines. They sneeze, cough, and dribble just like humans. And just like humans, these bodily actions expel germs and bits of bodily fluid or waste while it happens. Again, the less products are exposed to unnecessary animal germs and the dirt they drag in on their bodies and fur, the better. \n\nYour support animal is *not* a medical necessity. It\u2019s a *support*, a *support* with which *billions* of people who need mental *support* go without every single time they enter a shop. \n\nA *service* dog is classed as *medical equipment*, because they can literally be keeping their owners alive by guiding them away from certain things, or alerting to low or high blood sugars, or oncoming seizures. \n\nYour support animal is unnecessary in every way that affects those around you. It\u2019s presence is a risk to genuine service animals, their humans, and the general health of others - the same as any other animal, which is why they aren\u2019t allowed in stores or many public buildings. \n\nA service dog is also a risk, *but* because the owner has a better quality of life (bordering on reliance for survival) with this animal present, a compromise is made where the risk is deemed minimal enough. \n\nIf support animals were allowed in, everyone and their mother would just bring their dirty animals into the shops.", "If the dog was trained properly, it wouldn't have growled", "Idk about everywhere, but where I live, animals need zero training to be ESA. You just need a letter from a mental health or medical professional to show your landlord, so they have to let you have it regardless of no-pet rules. \n\nMy ex-bf's best friend had a trained service animal, and the difference in the dog's behavior when he had his harness on was wild. He went from a normal (well behaved) pet to \"I have a job to do and that is all I care about\" instantly. \n\nI have mental health issues, and I absolutely believe animals can be emotional support. But ESA and actual service animals are wildly different.", "There's ESA, which do NOT require specific training and are really only for rental accomodations (can not be turned away for having a pet whose existence does improve quality of life, typically by being cute and/or very bonded to the individual)\n\nThen, there's legitimate service animals. They are highly trained in a very specific way to (1) assist the handler with specific tasks, (2) in many cases, know when to ask for assistence when the handler cannot be assisted with their training and (3) ignore any distractions in public. No growling at other animals, no chasing down cars, and avoid as best as possible any other distraction while working for the handler. \n\nI understand it may not be clear, but the reality is that there are service dogs for mental and neurological disorders, but they still have to be skilled and composed in such a way as compared to an ESA. An ESA may pick up deep pressure therapy as a way they can assist their human, but they will still not have the same temperment in public as a trained service dog.", "A psychiatric service dog is *not* an emotional support animal. ESA are pets that you have a prescription for.", "ESAs don't have to go through training. My daughter (at her doctors recommendation) can have her cat designated as an ESA so she can continue to have her for emotional support. My daughter has thus far refused, but in our state all ESA designation allows is for your animal to live in your home with no added fees and you can't be denied your esa in no pet housing (Except dorms). She would not be allowed to take her esa into any business that doesn't allow pets. An ESA is basically a prescribed pet. An SA is task-trained and a necessary piece of medical equipment. PTSD, autism, etc can absolutely require an SA, but an ESA is not the same.", "The biggest difference between the two is tasks. A service dog performs specific tasks to mitigate a person\u2019s disability, like deep pressure therapies or alerting to behaviors that show a panic attack is oncoming. An emotional support dog doesn\u2019t have a task. They support by existing.", "If properly trained to the right public access standards, a dog to help with PTSD or autism would be considered a service/assistance dog, not an ESA.

There are trained SAs for mental health disabilities too.\n\nHere\u2019s the real question: did your ESA cost 20k and require multiple years of intense training to be non-reactive in most situations? No? Then it\u2019s not a SA. \n\nFor the record, some ESAs have been known to harm SAs.

What you're describing is a psychiatric service dog, not an ESA.", "That\u2019s not an emotional support animal that\u2019s actual a psychiatric service animal that provides a task for the person with a psychiatric disorder, ergo a full service animal.  You are mistaking the two, they are wholly different.", "There are true service dogs for PTSD and ASD, not ESAs. These dogs go through specific training.\n\nAs someone with an ESA, I can confirm that she has ZERO training and is fully accepted as an ESA. Here\u2019s the process I went through to get her marked an ESA. I talked with my counselor about getting an ESA letter for my cat. She has seen how my cat interacts due to our visits having shifted to virtual since the pandemic. She told me I had to be able to articulate specific ways my cat helps my anxiety and depression. Fortunately she had also seen the way my cat helps calm my anxiety, the way she responds if I cry or get visibly anxious. So then she wrote an official letter I could present to my landlord. Thus my cat is an ESA, no training involved. Personally, I don\u2019t like bringing them into a non-pet friendly space so I still went looking for a pet friendly property, thus the only benefit I get is they can\u2019t charge me pet rent. But it still was nice to have that reassurance she is protected because she does do a lot for my anxiety.", "I think you are confusing an emotional support animal and a psychiatric support animal, which is an actual service animal.", "If someone has a mental disability they can get a service dog for that. If you just want to bring your dog to the produce section you say you have an ESA.
