It drives me insane, if he puts the vibrator on his side. It's loud and does absolutely nothing for relaxation. It's a cheap add-on and reminds me of the hotel beds you used to be able to put change in to make them vibrate. Absolutely, useless. I feel for you. NTA. Hopefully, your parents will get bored of this little \"feature\" soon. My husband did. (Maybe, because I told him I couldn't go to work, if I couldn't get my sleep.) The only thing I can suggest, is maybe you let them know you can't go to school, if you're too sleepy.", "NTA, maybe suggest they lie in your room while it's on. Also, look at gorilla mats on amazon - they are designed for home exercise to soften the sound for neighbours below. Maybe something like this would be a good solution. Or maybe they will get bored on it soon enough.", "NTA.\nBut is there a compromise available? Like yoga mats under their bed frame to absorb the vibrations? Moving your bed a bit farther from the wall to prevent vibration travel?", "NTA.  The vibrate feature on those adjustable beds are fucking horrible & loud. Being in the room underneath would make it so much worse. \n\nIs there another bedroom to move to? I feel for ya.", "NTA\n\nMy responses to this at your age would have been either \n\n1. Come up with some noise that you CAN sleep with but will annoy them.\n\n2. Let myself bomb some tests in school and be upfront with anyone that asks about the fact that I can't sleep.\n\nI actually did end up getting a worse grade on an end of semester final one year because my mother thought it was a good idea to wake me up at 3 am for a water leak that I couldn't even actually help her with.\n\n\nIf you haven't already, try a white noise app on your phone and if that helps, force them to buy you a white noise machine.\n\nPersonally I use a loud box fan to help me sleep.", "Nta , offer to let them try out your experience and see if you are being  dramatic.", "It seems to me that the vibrations of the bed are traveling thru the structure of the house. I know sounds weird but I'm studying structural engineering and have had to take several courses on acoustics. To help with the sound you can do a few things:\n1) make sure the bed isn't touching the wall or base boards. Pull it out at least an inch.\n2) assuming they don't have carpet in their bedroom get a rug to put under the bed. Large area rugs are expensive so if your parents don't want to spend that kind of money they could buy a cheap area rug and cut out pieces to put under the legs and any part of the bed that touches the floor, big beds sometimes have post in the middle to give the mattress extra support. \n\nBut you will eventually get used to the noise, it just takes time.", "NTA, take a look if their bed is touching the wall or any furniture also. \n\nThen also ask them if they can get some rubber sound dampening pads on the base of the bed.\n\nAlso if they are kind enough to no use it all night or after like 11pm.\n\nAnd get them in your room while their bed is on so they can hear it too, on a quiet day.", "NAH. Ask them to switch beds one night and blast the vibration on high. There is potential a return guarantee too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As someone who is a light sleeper I feel you. However your parents do have the right to use their bed and the features they paid for. However there may be a compromise. \n\nOptions: \n\n1) There are two brands of earplugs that I use that are very effective:\n\n[happy ears](https://www.happyearsearplugs.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjww4-hBhCtARIsAC9gR3ZBagv48s0Z9nFlDVO5LH6sJPkyeUD9RAUC8G2duPtdW0VfCCFf8isaAlJJEALw_wcB)\n\n[ear secret](https://a.co/d/cb6cwJr)\n\n\n2) quiet hours. Maybe they just don\u2019t use it late into the night? Or just on weekends?\n\n3) swap rooms with someone else?\n\n\n\nYou will want to approach the subject calmly and without accusations. \n\n\nAlso you may get used to the sounds. I have gotten used to a lot of sounds that I did not think I would be okay with at first.", "My dear interlocutor, in this delicate matter, one must consider the needs and desires of all parties involved. As such, I am inclined to declare this situation as ESH. Your parents, having invested a considerable sum in their luxurious new sleeping apparatus, are understandably eager to avail themselves of its various features. However, it is equally essential that they remain cognizant of the impact their nocturnal activities may have upon their offspring, particularly with regard to your need for a restful night's slumber.\n\nAt the same time, it is incumbent upon you to exhibit a measure of adaptability and understanding as you navigate this novel predicament. Your parents' offer to provide earplugs represents a commendable attempt at compromise, and it may behoove you to explore additional solutions, such as rearranging the layout of your sleeping quarters or employing white noise machines to mitigate the disturbances. In so doing, you and your parents may yet arrive at a harmonious resolution, ensuring the satisfaction and well-being of all parties involved.", "YTA. Parents get to have sex too", "They make noise bumpers for dryers in apartment buildings like [this](https://URMAXCrystalClearAntiVibrationBumperPadsWashingMachineAntiVibrasionAnti-WalkPadWasherFootPadsStabilizerShockAbsorberNoiseDampeningShockProofNonSlipFootGripPadsSetof4https://a.co/d/2jSuO9P) and [this](https://a.co/d/7xI6FET)", "[removed]", "Even if they do have carpet, wouldn't a large rug help?", "Doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s a sex thing - just a bed feature thing", "They left the noisemaker brrrrrrrrrrrr on all night.\n\nThey definitely weren\u2019t having sex all night.\n\nIf they want to play with bed vibes they should turn them off when they sleep.\n\nThose damn vibrational frequencies travel right through floors and are obnoxious.  I have a silent ceiling fan in a living room that sounds like a buzzing thousand watt light fluorescent in the bedroom above when it runs.", "Well, that\u2019s one way to ensure your kids speak to you as little as possible once adult.  Total inflexibility.\n\nIt\u2019s silly.  Parents just need to turn off the growling behemoth when they go to sleep/are not playing.  Or put it on a timer.  It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a needed or desired function while they\u2019re unconscious.  It\u2019s just burning out the machinery faster.\n\nEven the woo-science people who claim it\u2019s therapeutic for a variety of conditions and age only recommend 15-30 minutes daily.", "I don't really think it matters. I'm assuming that the parents work. They bought a better bed so they could enjoy and sleep better. Sucks for OP, but that's too bad. Some advice for OP. Study hard, find a job, save up, graduate high school, go to college, study hard there, graduate college, get a job, and finally, get your own house. Then you can regulate it all you want. Maybe by the time OP is their parents' age, they'll understand why the parents bought that bed.", "I\u2019m sorry, but the implication that the OP has no right to a good night\u2019s rest every night because it isn\u2019t her house is ridiculous. Her parents have a right to relax too but their are other ways to relax that don\u2019t involve depriving your daughter of sleep.", "Yeah children, study hard whilst being unable to get adequate night's sleep. Work hard when because of a lack of sleep you can barely stay awake during work hours.\n\nBloody idiot.", "NTA. At 15, I would have had a mental breakdown if I couldn't sleep more than an hour in a night because my parents decided to get something like that.\n\nBetween the pressures of school/peers and the hormones of growing up, sleep is absolutely essential for maintaining a semblance of sanity.\n\nI hope your parents can understand that.", "well, it\u2019s been one night. maybe you\u2019ll get used to it? maybe they should get you the same bed so you can do the same? maybe start sleeping on the living room couch if possible? maybe they\u2019ll just stop using it? i\u2019ve never had a feature like this, but personally, knowing how the hum of a car makes me tired, i bet i\u2019d like it to be able to fall asleep. maybe there is a timer option on it they could use, they just chose not to the first night or didn\u2019t know it existed? this is a tough one. i mean, aside from those suggestions, just letting them know it had made it hard for you to sleep is all you can really do. it doesn\u2019t make you an AH, the way your parents reacted was kind of AH-ish, but maybe it\u2019ll sink in more and they\u2019ll think it through and come to a reasonable compromise or something."]}
