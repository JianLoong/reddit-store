He provided a lesser replacement and how did he act?  Like a petulant child.\n\nYou deserve a direct replacement.", "NTA, in my opinion. He should replace the item he broke with the exact same item. \n\nAlso, what adult throws a controller when they lose, anyway? Like come on, you don't get to act like a literal baby AND be cheap.", "NTA. He broke your Pikachu controllers, and owes you a Pikachu controller. Not a cheaper one. If we wanted to buy a generic one, he should've thrown and broken a generic controller. Dude is a sore loser and an AH.", "NTA. He should replace exactly what he broke.\n\nPersonally I think the real AH here is the company charging $130 for controllers. Yeesh.", "NTA. He broke your controller in a fit of rage because he lost a game, it is absolutely his responsibility to replace exactly what he broke. Even if he accidentally broke it, he'd still he obligated to replace it. If he didn't want to spend the money, he should have better coping mechanisms when it comes to losing.", "NTA, half of what makes the switch special are the unique controllers. He broke them he needs to replace them, that goes with anything.", "NTA. He should replace what he broke, and red and blue joycons weren't it. \n\nINFO: Did the joycon controllers break or just the joycon controller shells?", "NTA\n\nAnd you shouldn't stay with a guy who smashes your belongings when he gets angry. This is a very serious warning sign.", "I get his point too, but he should go use his own of the colours he wants next time he is a sore loser and breaks them. And replace yours correctly of course.\n\nNta", "NTA...it'd be different if he broke them in a more accidental way but nah he threw them!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not surprisingly it broke. He should replace it with the same item he broke. \nNow if it were an accident a little flexibility might be in order. But he's old enough to be not living at home, he's old enough to know not to throw stuff, especially if it does t belong to him.", "NTA  \nThere is clearly a difference,  and it mattered to you enough to pay the difference. He should replace the item he broke, not the cheapest similar alternative.", "Tell him to get better at the game and maybe next time he won\u2019t rage and throw someone else\u2019s shit in anger\nSide note, stop playing smash on joy cons lol", "Nope. If you want to be an immature Neanderthal and throw controllers during a tantrum then be prepared to pay the price. \n\nOP you are not in the wrong here, Mr 2 year old needs to be getting you the correct controllers.", "You have a choice now, colours or friendship. You\u2019ll probably loose both though.  He won\u2019t buy the more expensive ones, your choice to forgive or move on, he\u2019ll break them too next time", "Idk it\u2019s not really friendship to be honest. We don\u2019t do anything outside of the occasional Smash Bros or some conversations when both of us are bored in the apartment", "Nta tell him you'll take him to court that you told him you want specific ones he broke your thing on purpose no sympathy for him", "NTA! As everyone has said when you break something you replace it with the exact same thing .", "NTA. He owes you exactly what he broke.", "NTA replace what he broke. If he ruined your signed book he wouldn't replace it with one from Barne's and Noble.", "NTA. You can go to small claims court over this and then he will be legally expected to pay you back.", "YTA simply because they are joycons. It's pretty straightforward to replace the shells on joycons and it doesn't sound like you were collecting them if they were being played on which means they had an expiration date on them. Just make him replace the shells.", "If he was apologetic afterwards and then asked nicely if he could replace them with a cheaper color, I probably wouldn\u2019t have cared (if I was in your situation). The fact that he destroyed the expensive one and just assumed he could replace it with a different one and tried to play if off would irk me and then I would make him get the actual replacement. NTA", "NTA, absolutely, especially because he broke them intentionally (a mantrum counts as intentional to me). For me personally, if a friend broke them ACCIDENTALLY and I knew they were short on cash, I would be fine with them just giving me the money for the base controllers and I'd make up the difference for the premium style. Even if it was a complete accident, you'd be within your rights to expect an exact replacement, but I think there can be different views on that.\n\nI think that when we share or host, there's an element of risk involved and my friends or guests aren't responsible for my expensive tastes in cases of accidents. In cases of intentional abuse or destruction, though, you better replace exactly what you broke.", "NTA does he not understand you break someone's shit you buy it? Not you break it you buy a similar replacement.", "NTA, but send them to Nintendo! They fix them! They might charge you, but you can ask him to pay. I\u2019ve done it. It\u2019s fast.", "Never play with him again.

OP likely got them off eBay by someone who marked them up because of how rare they are.", "NTA. I might feel a little different if it were accidental breakage but not for an act of rage.", "Where did you buy controllers for 130 bucks. You got scammed for sure bud. Also, exclusive controllers aren't readily available if at all. So you are SOL about finding those controllers again.", "Agreed, a lesser replacement doesn\u2019t make whole. \n\nIf someone hits your car and totals it they have to replace your car. They can argue that a used Toyota is a perfectly fine car and will do everything you need a car to do but if your car was a Ferrari that Toyota isn\u2019t going to cut it as a replacement.\n\nHold the line OP. Don\u2019t open that box, make him return it and get your proper replacement.", "> Also, exclusive controllers aren't readily available if at all. \n\nThat's probably why they're more expensive than the plain ones.", "If he didn't want to spend 50 extra dollars, he shouldn't have childishly purposefully broken something that costs 50 extra dollars. Pay up and grow up.\n\nNTA", "Eh, that is a bad example. Unfortunately they only have to pay for the current value of your car. Even if that is only 1500 and literally cannot even pay for another car at all, even though you had a working car and now you have to make up the thousands of dollar difference in order to buy a similar one", "Nta OP. Tell him\nTo use his own controllers when playing since he can\u2019t respect yours", "NTA. Your roommate is an doubly entitled AH for breaking your joycon and not paying for an exact replacement. Actions have consequences. He\u2019s acting like a 12 year old", "NTA at all! You break it, you buy it, man. Why wouldn't you want an exact replacement?", "NTA\n\nYou want him to replace what he broke (in a fit of childish rage, no less). He brought you something different. He needs to replace the actual item lost", " Stop supporting Nintendo's greed by buying way overpriced garbage controllers.", "INFO: what exactly can the pikachu controllers do that the standard controllers cant?", "$140 on eBay. But I was able to find them no problem.", "if someone totals your car and replaces it with the exact same make and model, same condition it was in prior to the accident, would you complain because the replacement is red when your old car is yellow? there are actual hardware differences between a ferrari and a toyota. the only difference between the controllers is the color (and the price tag). frankly, op got scammed into paying more by nintendo.", "Or in the case of my mom where her truck got totaled but she was paying a note so the car company got their money and she\u2019s left with no car and no money", "NTA. He should be replacing the same one that he broke, regardless of the price", "NTA at all. He\u2019s not replacing what he broke by buying a different color even if it performs the same tasks. They\u2019re not like the ones he destroyed.", "NTA - you paid the extra money for something he destroyed, he pays the extra money to replace it. Also, maybe don't ever play video games with this person again.", "If I paid extra for a color, or a custom paint job, yes, I\u2019d be disappointed.  Your insurance contract has statements about that, however.\n\nAnd someone paying extra for a color they like isn\u2019t being scammed: it\u2019s paying for what makes you happy.", "it absolutely is a scam when you can buy paint and paint your controller whatever color you want instead of paying 50 extra dollars for literally nothing"]}
