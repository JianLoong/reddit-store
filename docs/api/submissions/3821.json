He provided a lesser replacement and how did he act?  Like a petulant child.\n\nYou deserve a direct replacement.", "NTA, in my opinion. He should replace the item he broke with the exact same item. \n\nAlso, what adult throws a controller when they lose, anyway? Like come on, you don't get to act like a literal baby AND be cheap.", "NTA. He broke your Pikachu controllers, and owes you a Pikachu controller. Not a cheaper one. If we wanted to buy a generic one, he should've thrown and broken a generic controller. Dude is a sore loser and an AH.", "NTA. He should replace exactly what he broke.\n\nPersonally I think the real AH here is the company charging $130 for controllers. Yeesh.", "NTA. He broke your controller in a fit of rage because he lost a game, it is absolutely his responsibility to replace exactly what he broke. Even if he accidentally broke it, he'd still he obligated to replace it. If he didn't want to spend the money, he should have better coping mechanisms when it comes to losing.", "NTA, half of what makes the switch special are the unique controllers. He broke them he needs to replace them, that goes with anything.", "NTA. He should replace what he broke, and red and blue joycons weren't it. \n\nINFO: Did the joycon controllers break or just the joycon controller shells?", "NTA\n\nAnd you shouldn't stay with a guy who smashes your belongings when he gets angry. This is a very serious warning sign.", "I get his point too, but he should go use his own of the colours he wants next time he is a sore loser and breaks them. And replace yours correctly of course.\n\nNta", "NTA...it'd be different if he broke them in a more accidental way but nah he threw them!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not surprisingly it broke. He should replace it with the same item he broke. \nNow if it were an accident a little flexibility might be in order.

If you want to be an immature Neanderthal and throw controllers during a tantrum then be prepared to pay the price. \n\nOP you are not in the wrong here, Mr 2 year old needs to be getting you the correct controllers.", "You have a choice now, colours or friendship. You\u2019ll probably loose both though.
