It sounds pretty toxic to me. Good for you for doing what\u2019s necessary to manage your mental health.", "NTA. You have to do whats right for you; you can't rely on this family that is so absorbed in the toxic environment they're creating that they don't even notice or care how uncomfortable it makes you. You used the word 'trigger', so I'm guessing it's a LOT of discomfort that this environment causes. \n\nFamily can suck. Adults can be very selfish and immature and demanding. Don't feel guilty for not bending.", "NTA. This isn't on you or your anxiety. No one wants to be forced to listen to other people fight like that.

No one would want to be stuck in a situation with four toxic people screaming at one another, let alone a 16-year-old with anxiety. Take care of yourself. You don't have to be in a sick environment like that.", "NTA. Your dad should be prepared you see you outside his new home.

He's not looking after your mental health, so until he does I'd say you plan to meet for lunch or coffee until that time.", "NTA, it sounds like his house has descended into chaos.
