It tends to be a formal event with family and friends, often akin to a small wedding in terms of invites and presentation. Obviously everyone does not do this, but based on the details in the post, I think this is larger than just a family get together to celebrate.", "seriously - are these parents royalty or something?  are there VIP guests?  who would be embarassed - the parents?  so what if she isn't great - she is their daughter - if I had a kid who was a mediocre pianist and they wanted to play at my anniversary dinner, I would let them - OP doesn't sound like she thinks she has a music career or anything........its a family dinner - I honestly can't see what the big deal is - even if she got up there and played a scale in c major it shouldn't matter........", "The person being told \"we don't want you\" you ignorant turnip.  How dare this person have feelings.", "OP should continue to pursue piano if that\u2019s really her passion, but she cannot demand to put that on display at someone else\u2019s event. Her parents only had to turn her down because she offered. People are free to decline when someone offers something they don\u2019t want.", "yeah, OP hates her sister for something that isn't Ava's fault. just like Ava said. \n\nThis has less to do with the piano and more to do with OP wanting to be better than Ava.", "I'm definitely imagining a dinner party at a house. \nBut even still, that doesn't change the context for me.\n\nThese are her parents friends and family.  They presumably are already aware of the context. \n\nIs OP going to knock it out of the park? No.  But neither are most amateurs.  \n\nAt the end of the day this was a gift OP really wanted to give her parents and was told she wasn't good enough.\n\nThat fucking blows.\n\nThat especially blows when it's wrapped up in your trauma from your car accident.  Trauma your family is presumably all aware of but still in no way tried to support you.\n\nThe family isn't wrong.  OP isn't wrong.  No one here is wrong.\n\nBut man no one in this story seems to give a fuck about how any other human being feels.", "Where I am a 25th anniversary is usually a formal event on the scale of a small wedding. Definitely not a place for your kid to show off their  \u201cokay\u201d piano skills.", "She\u2019s also 23\u2026", "Not being overly sensitive is ignorant now? Jesus. I\u2019m Gen Z we\u2019re suppose to be the sensitive ones not y\u2019all. Grow up.", "They shouldn't have let her plan the event and then ask for live music then pretend they're surprised she would want to play. That feigned stupidity on their part is just childish. If they want the benefit of OP's party planning they shouldn't expect her to gracefully accept their opinion that her playing is trash and they're ashamed of it.", "> At the end of the day this was a gift OP really wanted to give her parents and was told she wasn't good enough.\n\nOP is going to have to accept that her skills were apparently already no match for those of her sister, and after the accident even less so. Trying to hijack someone\u2019s party and then browbeat them into letting you play is not the way to handle this situation, no matter how upset you are about the crappy hand you\u2019ve been dealt. If OP is as passionate about playing piano as she says, she should stick with it, but foisting herself off at what could potentially be a formal event is not the way to go.\n\nIn fact, I think had both of them played that there would have been even more resentment. If OP\u2019s sister blew everyone away or even just enough for people to enjoy, and then OP comes in with the ability of perhaps a children\u2019s recital, don\u2019t you think that would be more awkward and embarrassing for OP? Even if everyone is polite and claps, the disparity would exist, and OP would know it. It honestly seems better that she didn\u2019t play for that reason alone because she doesn\u2019t seem to be at a place in her recovery that she has fully dealt with the acceptance stage of her grief.", "I don't give a fuck about what you think.", "Planning the party and playing piano are two different things. It\u2019s pretty normal for family members to help plan a major anniversary party like this if they aren\u2019t hiring an event planner; it does not mean the person pitching in gets carte blanche to perform. OP didn\u2019t have to plan the party at all, but to try to force them into it by demanding they let her play or she will walk is unbelievably immature and boorish. It\u2019s like a toddler throwing a tantrum because they didn\u2019t get their way. \n\nAnyways, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to change your mind and vice versa, so I guess agree to disagree.", "Maybe they thought she was now aware how bad she sucked before and after the accident. She's always been jealous of her sister because she had natural talent and their teacher pointed that out the entire time. What I see in all of this is that OP has always been at best a mediocre player who practiced a lot to be able to be nearly as good as her sister but never could and that's why she resented her sister.\nMy sister is better than me in so many things and I do wish I was more like her in some directions at time but never resent her.\nAnd it's their parents anniversary event. They decide what goes. Clearly showing disrespect to them while her sister was playing the piano is why I almost know for sure OP is a mediocre piano player and bad sister: she can't even stand her sister being complimented for her skills.\nYTA", "I think everything you said is absolutely true.\n\nOur divide is that I don't think OP's sister is going to blow everyone away.  This is family.  Presumably everyone's been hearing her play for 18 odd years.\n\nThis isn't trying to impress the neighbors.   This is family.\n\nAnd ultimately, being told \"you're not good enough for family but your sister is\" fucking blows.\n\nThat also doesn't excuse that all the sister probably heard this whole time is \"I don't want you to play for our parents.  You're not allowed to have this.\" Which makes her blow up very reasonable.\n\nI think that everyone did their best in a messy situation, everyone stepped on everyone's feelings, but ultimately everyone knows that and so everyone just needs to say sorry.", "This is a lot of comments for someone who doesn\u2019t care what I have to say :) I hope you have a better evening and stop taking life so seriously", "obviously you do. and the angry reaction? yeah you care a lot buddy.", "She doesn't have to blow everyone away. OP will be listening to Ava play, and resenting her. \n\nAt this point, I think OP just resents Ava for existing.", "YTA. Just how petty are you??  You're 23 years old but you behaved like a sulky toddler. This was supposed to be a celebration for your parents but you made it all about you.  And being resentful of your sister because she's better at something than you is unfair and seems rather toxic.", "YTA\n\nYou need to grow up.\n\nI know them not wanting you to play was hurtful, but the bitterness you have for your sister rolls off the page.\n\nShe's never lashed out at you in the past? What does that mean? That she's had reason to lash out, but has just put up with your attitude? \n\nWhat did you expect from her?\n\n\"I told them they knew my feelings about her\"\n\nWhile she was there? \n\nLOLWOW", "I feel for you and I\u2019m sorry about your accident but you need to get over yourself. This is about your parents, they wanted Ava to play for whatever reason, it\u2019s their choice. You need to get over resenting your younger sister over something that she has nothing to do with or her natural talent, it just makes you look like a big ugly green monster of jealousy.", "NTA and maybe reevaluate your relationships. Your family do not have your back.", "She might have got more empathy from her sister if she didn't say things like \"they know how I feel about her\" in front of her.", "She offered to split the music and they refused.

Who gives a crap if OP plays a couple of not so perfect songs while Ava plays the most.\n\nOP, YTA and seem resentful and jealous, but the whole family dynamic feels very dysfunctional so maybe more of an ESH.", "How is that her sisters fault? Meanwhile, OP has no drama's reminded her parents how she feels about her sister. While her sister is there.\n\nOP is shocked because her sister had never lashed out before. How many times has her sister just bit her tongue because OP is being bitter and resentful.", "She was organizing the dinner, she literally does get a say. This is not some coronation but a celebration of the memories the parents have shared which should include both children.

Out loud, if it helps. \n\nAva finally snapped because OP was being rude about her, while she was there.", "Doesn\u2019t matter, being jealous of your younger sister is weird and childish.", "Then Ava should not get mad when sister walks out.", "Nah, Ava hates the piano and was forced to play. She knows her sister loves the piano, it doesn't matter who is better at piano because it's not professional but a personal setting where OP asked to play. Ava is lording it up over her injured sister so she has to accept Ava will play... when Ava doesn't like the piano. So from what OP says at least, Ava is largely doing this to spite OP.\n\nAva could have just as easily said lets both play, instead everyone is being shitty about it.", "Also if you have two kids that have played piano their entire lives, id bet money you have a lot of friends that are musicians as well.  People that would clearly know the difference between an ok piano player and a good piano player", "Is Ava just supposed to sit down and shut up, even after OP has said \"they know how I feel about her\"? \n\nSure.", "Or maybe she clearly doesn't hate playing the piano as much as her sister says she does.  She is 22 years old, she isn't forced to play piano anymore.", "It's their parents anniversary not a coronation for a king. She was the organizing the event, she didn't hijack a thing. Being 23 does not negate her feelings.", "ESH. Your feelings about recovering from the accident are of course valid. Your behavior - and your sister's behavior - at the celebration of your parents was silly and embarrassing. If you needed to separate yourself from the situation to take care of yourself once she began playing, I have no judgment about that. Everything leading up to that, however, conveys a need to work on yourself to resolve your resentments. It's understandable to feel party guests were being unkind by insisting on your sister; it was nevertheless a poor choice to double down and make it about you. Your sister's comments were hateful, particularly when it was already evident the situation was emotionally charged for you. Swift healing to you with all of this.", "ESH your parents were insensitive by saying they would rather hear your sister play instead of just saying \"sorry we already asked your sister\" and you are AH by saying you wouldn't attend because of who played piano and your sister was a AH for saying that", "Ignore their words; you\u2019re not the issue. Clearly, your parents don\u2019t show concern, so cease seeking their validation. Allow them to fade away. If you concentrate on yourself, you\u2019ll find improved self-esteem. Begin a small business, play piano for strangers, and embark on solo trips. Your current circle breeds depression and resentment; it\u2019s time to break free from this cycle of misery.", "NTA I don\u2019t fully understand the Y T A votes. Yes this event was for your parents, but that doesn\u2019t mean they should forget to be parents.
