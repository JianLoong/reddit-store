No need to talk to Mary, just throw the shit away and move on.", "YTA. \n\nYou sound like a deeply insecure person. Instead of going around spreading gossip, you could have asked Mary directly.

I would feel like Mary thought I couldn't feed my kid or buy him toys. It was extremely condescending and insulting.", "This is what I thought as well. Misunderstanding all the way around, complicated by not talking to the actual party involved. I absolutely thought of the phone game the minute OP mentioned talking to a parent from school. Parent groups at school are full of cliques and gossip, it can be worse than the kids in school.", "[deleted]", "That doesn\u2019t make sense at all..,just because OP is a nurse doesn\u2019t mean she can handle donations intended for the hospital and especially without Mary communicating her intent.", "It was shelf-stable foods. And while nothing was expired there was some stuff with seasonal branding or relatively close expiration dates making me think she'd probably had it for a while. None of them were foods/brands my son often eats/likes, which I say not to sound ungrateful, but to say that she didn't just say \"Hey sweetie pick out what you want.\" She had selected these items and put them in a bag. He didn't even know what was in there.\n\nVery different than if she'd sent home cookies they'd made, veggies from their garden, or even leftovers.", "That's a valid point.", "Yes.  In my family whenever there is a get-together, everyone leaves with leftovers, either something they brought or something else, depends on who wants what.  Especially if it was a whole turkey or a whole pan of baked salmon that was cooked 'in case everyone wants seconds' (which never happens but you never know) or a big cake or several pies - everyone is asked to take some home with them!   But canned goods would be insulting with one exception - if that's something they get that they don't eat and they know that you do.  Kind of 'regifting' to avoid wasting if you happen to be there vs. having to make a special trip to take it to a collection site.  I still remember the excelled canned beef I got from a cousin of my Dad's, I tried to buy the same and it's apparently some kind of army surplus deal where you have to order 5000 cans at a time (it would take me the rest of my life to eat that!).  She got several cans as part of some elderly nutrition program in her town and gave us a couple cans knowing we like to use it in a specific dish and it's easier to use canned vs. first having to stew it from scratch which takes hours...", "That's nasty. Literally and figuratively.", "You don\u2019t get your donations home with a kid without checking with the parent first.", "She could have asked co-workers, relatives, friends outside the school...she instead decided to start gossip and drama with school moms.", "Don't sense check if you have friends like OP. If anything, have a better taste when it comes to friends, because OPs ones are just gossipy and full of drama.", "And what did Mary say when you asked her why she sent the things home with your son?", "But you had to know that talking to another parent at the school would absolutely spread the gossip. It is like a game of telephone. Each person tells \"just one other person\"  and then all of a sudden everyone knows and the story has become something other than the truth.\n\nYou could have had a sanity check with someone at work, friends outside of the parent group, family. \n\nWhat did Mary say when you asked her about the things she sent home?", "Next time, do the sanity check with some friend or family member who is not connected to the school.\n\nIt is not clear what caused Mary to do what she did-a strange thing to do. However, I would not jump to a conclusion to her motivations without talking to her FIRST.\n\nAlso, we have moved a few times and it is really f*ng difficult to get myself to be part of such \u201ctight knit\u201d parent groups and difficult to get my kid to get friends and play dates when everyone already knows each other. So shame on you for making it more difficult for Mary and in particular to the kid.\nYTA", "YTA. You have no idea why she gave you those items. For all you know she thought your son (her son\u2019s new BFF) might enjoy them. You don\u2019t know that she was setting them aside for Goodwill (really ritzy people often don\u2019t even bother with things like that), and you have no idea that it was meant as a slight towards you.", "Mary was wrong, 100%, and OP had every right to talk to her about it. I also think there's an issue with OP knowing that Mary AND her son are being ostracized and not wanting to do anything. It makes it seem like the school vibe itself is very elitist and mean girls-esque. Isolating a woman AND, in turn, her child, for this? Her child is going to suffer more than Mary. This poor kid is never going to be invited places. Yes, it's partially on Mary for being elitist herself. It's also on OP and the rest of the involved parents for engaging in such childish actions.\n\nEveryone sucks here, for me, including OP.", "The above comment didn\u2019t suggest contacting the school.\n\nThey suggested contacting someone not connected with the school, like a sister or a work friend, or someone else out of the circle", "Arh there you go making assumptions as well.  She went straight to the phone to bitch about this woman and surprise Pikachu face gossiping about this woman didn't end well. \nop should have rang the mum thanked her or clarified  why and then taken them to a charity shop without trying to run down this woman without even speaking to her first. That trumps whatever weirdness she felt. He sanity check was just an excuse gossip about this mum.\nMafia mums bring down other mums and they isolated them. She doesn't seem like she is going to apologise anytime soon.", "\\- and just to add onto this, the mother of one of my daughter's friends clearly has a very strong love language of giving gifts.  She not only takes the kids out to eat and sends my daughter home with leftovers, she often will also order a dessert or something to send home to me.  She also shows up with small gifts for me when we have met for lunch or whatever. We are definitely on even footing financially, she just loves to feed people and give little gifts.", "You don't know that's what happened. As another poster said Mary could've said, Hey, you want this? and the kid, feeling awkward, could've said yes so he could get back to being with his friend. There are a hellalot of assumptions being made here.", "Or.. She just went to other people closer to the situation?\n\nI do think you're reading into this waaaaaay too much.\n\nLike my friends who have kids don't talk to me about school stuff usually. They talk to their \"parent friends\" they met at schools or groups and stuff. Or I'll talk to someone who might be more familiar with the people involved.", "Gossipy yes! Drama, not so much?\n\nI mean if I heard that someone was a bit of a snobby elitist I wouldn't want to hangout with her either. That's not a drama. Thats me being an adult deciding I've got better things to do than be friends with another adult.\n\nHonestly feel like everyone here is analysing this like a high school cafeteria scene.\n\nMost people aren't malicious. Odds are op talked to a friend without thinking about the consequences. That friend then went and told her friend without thinking. And we got a whole chain of events.\n\nThis isn't op being catty wanting ruin other mum's rep mean girl style.", "Apologies responded to the wrong comment by accident", "She knew what she was doing."]}
