I have a 14 week old and I would never consider changing her nappy in the middle of a flight not in the bathroom. Firstly, it\u2019s unsafe to do so, what if there is turbulence.

Also, as someone who has been present for plane deep cleaning between flights, I use alcohol wipes to wipe my seat, tray table, seat belt. These things get wiped if noticeably dirty, but mostly just vacuumed. My wife once saw a baby accidentally poop on the tray table, and the parents wiped it with a napkin and put the table up.
