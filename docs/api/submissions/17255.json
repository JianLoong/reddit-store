You were asking something reasonable and for all that travelling with an infant is stressful, the parents know this when booking the ticket!\n\nThe only point of sympathy I would have for the parents is that the changing facilities in most airplanes are barely fit for purpose.

I\u2019ve always wondered what to do in that situation - no way both kids fit in the bathroom with you.

I take them to the loo with me and use liberally. And, because I have manners, I give my seat area another go-over as we approach for landing. \n\nThose travel packs of anti-bac wipes are great.
