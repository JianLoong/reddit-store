We were concerned it would hurt his ears. We had read that giving him something to drink would help equalize pressure so we brought 2 8oz and 1 4 oz bottles of apple juice. When we pulled out on the taxi way we gave him a bottle and he sucked it right down.  We didn't take off.  A few minutes later we started moving again and we gave him another bottle. Kid loved apple juice and slammed it down. Finally I waited until I felt the wheels actually leave the ground and gave him the last 4 oz bottle.  It seemed to work. No crying or fussing and things were looking good.  They were just serving the meal, which was pretty good; steak with a choice of wines or some chicken entree when the detonation happened.

Many stories to tell.", "Yeah, like with a mixture of bleach, ammonia, vinegar and fire. Why would anyone think that is ok? NTA.", "I'm not doubting you on it being a healthy occurrence, I am just saying that from experience breastfeeding is unfortunately no guarantee of a lighter poop change schedule lol!", "I forgot my mask when I took the streetcar the other day and was not impressed with myself. I've gotten a bit lax about wearing one, but still (almost) always wear it on transit. Pre-covid, I caught so many colds and the subway was likely the source of most of them. I haven't had a cold since 2019 now.", "[deleted]", "Who pissed in your cornflakes?", "I love especially love the pilot for shaming the parents over the PA.", "How helpful is it to wipe down the cart handle if we're going to touch a bunch of grocery items that have been touched by who knows how many people before us?", "One bout of norovirus, whether he contracts it on a plane or not and he'll be all about the wipes", "Love the vicks. I'm in the hospital right now w a broken kneecap and fractured femur. I asked the nurse if they have on Vicks as that helps pain. Well..I just gave u 10 mg of percocet.

While it can be normal to have infrequent stools, it's pretty clear that it's saying that it's normal to have one or the other. It literally starts off with \"The amount and frequency of a breastfed baby\u2019s wet diapers and bowel movements can be valuable indicators of his well-being\" \n\nThe frequency of stool for babies can vary, but not for the baby itself. If you have a steady diet then aside from the changes based on age, the frequency should remain the same. Not be multiple in a day, then none for days, then multiple in a day again. Either they have multiple in a day, or they go for days without. \n\nI haven't had a baby, no. I've just had multiple years of Med school training. Regular changes in frequency of bowel movements, that are not linked to changes in diet, or reaching age milestones are something that should be checked out.", "When bowel movements are less frequent, they should be soft, easy to pass, and more profuse in volume.

You are NOT any pediatrician, let alone MY child\u2019s pediatrician, and what you are doing is not only irresponsible but unethical.", "I don't think you're grasping what I'm saying. A baby that has infrequent bowel movements is not alarming. What is alarming is changes in frequency of bowel movements which are not linked to changes in diet or age milestones", "I said that you should go to a doctor, that's not medical advice, that's saying you should get medical advice. That's like saying it's unethical to tell you to got see a doctor after you've said that you have abdominal pain.\n\nI didn't tell you to give your baby some sort of medication, I didn't give you health advice. I said that if you see changing frequency of stools that aren't related to changes in diet that perhaps you should go to a doctor, because that can be a concerning thing"]}
