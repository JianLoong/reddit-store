My daughter lives with her mom but she spends most weekends at mine (unless she already has plans for that weekend). Her spending the weekend at mine usually means doing something \"fun\" during the day on Saturday, she then spends the whole evening and night in her room on her phone (like all teenagers) and then going out for lunch on Sunday before I drop her off back at her moms. But this Saturday it was about 5/6pm and my daughter asked me if we could watch something together. Which was extremely out of the ordinary but I agreed obviously. We ended up binging Breaking Bad and eating ice cream in bed. But around 10pm my gf texted me asking when she could come over and I realised that I completely forgot that I said she could come over on Saturday. So I just texted her saying if we could meet up tomorrow (Sunday) instead. But then she called me and she was angry that I changed plans in the last second and I didn't even tell her. I tried to explain the whole situation and that I simply forgot but she just hang up and then she texted me saying that if I don't care about our plans she's not coming over on Sunday. And she didn't. In fact we haven't seen each other since last week.

So for about 5 hours you knew you were going to hang out with your daughter instead but she didn't even cross your mind until she texted you. I feel like throwing in the daughter thing was intentional to get sympathy and skew the results. If you said you were watching TV with a friend and forgot to tell your GF you'd probably get different answers. YTA for not bothering to communicate and making your girlfriend feel like an afterthought.", "INFO- So is your gf treated like a booty call on the weekends? She was to come over at 10pm and the kid hasn\u2019t spent any time with her? How long have y\u2019all been together? \n\nIs it possible she is just tired of sneaking in at night? And then being forgotten about was the final straw?", "I'm going with YTA slightly. Prioritizing your daughter is good but you do own your GF a proper apology because cancelling plans last minute is not cool.\n\nAlso make sure to explain that your daughter wanting to hang out with you in the evening almost never happens and that you got lost in the moment. Still make sure to say you're sorry and apologize.", "N-T-A for spending time with your daughter. Your daughter should go before your girlfriend. \n\nBut Y-T-A for not informing your girlfriend about the change of plans until last second, and also completely forgetting that you even had plans with your girlfriend. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards soft YTA just because it is okay to change plans, especially when it\u2019s something to do with your own kid, but when you decide to change plans, you need to inform the person/people you originally had plans with. It is annoying to be told very last minute that there has been a change of plans.", "YTA, it's all cool you prioritize your daughter, as you should, but completely forgetting about plans with your gf? And when SHE texted to know what's going on you just went: don't really have time for you now, let's reschedule? No sorry, no nothing? Well, you seem like a good dad but a lousy boyfriend...", "YTA-you did everything right except informing your GF in a timely and respectful manor. Find a way and explain what happened. A note for you: By spending time with your daughter doesn\u2019t make you a super hero. This is the bare minimum and not an excuse for your poor behavior.  Grow up and manage your affairs.", "INFO: Have you cancelled plans last minute before? When and how often do you generally spend time with your gf (e.g., mostly weekdays, only once on weekends, multiple times per week)? What was the plan exactly that you had with your gf that Saturday?", "YTA - changing plans is ok. Forgetting your gf not.", "YTA - all the daughter stuff is somewhat irrelevant. It\u2019s great that it happened and you prioritized correctly, but really the message you gave your girlfriend is \u201cI needed to change plans, had every way and opportunity of communicating that, and completely ignored/abandoned/forgot you. My needs are more important than yours.\u201d", "YTA. Not for prioritizing your daughter, that is in fact to be commended! But you need to respect other's people time and you did not. You owe your gf a big apology.", "YTA\n\nThe issue isn't with your daughter being there - That's fine, that's a-okay, good job on putting your daughter above all else.  The issue is that you had plans with your girlfriend and blew them off at the very last second - and by last second, I mean you FORGOT entirely.\n\n  \nQuestion (just out of curiosity u/throw-aitaaakwv ):  How old is your daughter?

Change of plans and forgetting to inform  your girlfriend- it happens, and it's absolutely understandable. And forgivable.\n\nBut see the other side- she prepared, had a shower, shaved her legs and intended to visit you (maybe declined some other invitations too), and you did not even apologize for forgetting to inform her. Not good.\n\nIt's OK to prioritize a kid, but it doesn't mean that you don't owe an apology.", "YTA - you could\u2019ve shot her a text, but you forgot. Ok, well that\u2019s also a miscommunication on your end that you sprung on her in the moment.\n\nPlans change, and those changes need to be communicated.\n\nYour daughter is and should always be first to you, but since your partner is not obligated to that same #1 status, you cannot simply make last min changes as you wish on plan you previously made. Especially if you don\u2019t communicate it.", "The way I see it is a very light YTA. I fully get you want to spend time with your daughter and she unexpectedly wanted to come and watch TV with you which is nice, but you should've let your gf know, although I feel her reaction may have been over the top. Imo the fact you forgot about your gf so easily makes me wonder how much you want to spend time with her? All said and done, we all make mistakes but you definitely should've apologised, very light YTA.", "YTA for forgetting. I know it happens but you made plans and let her down. It\u2019s wonderful that you had a bonding experience with your daughter but completely forgetting that you had made plans with your girlfriend is hurtful to her. She has a right to rethink the relationship since seeing she\u2019s not a big priority to you.", "Changes of plans need to be communicated\n\nYta\n\nYour gf deserves basic courtesy\nHeck, why should she be absent when your daughter is there?\nI mean, as long as you do make boundaries clear and she does not try to order your daughter around, no problem.\n\nDaughter and gf can treat one another as guests.", "Yta- not because you prioritized your daughter (that's way cool btw).\n\nIt's bc you left your girlfriend hanging. \n\nMy partner always has good intentions, but this happened to us enough that I almost broke it off with him. He'd make plans with me and forget. Then he'd make plans with someone else.\n\nI didn't usually care if he hung out with others. I cared that he didn't find me important enough to communicate with about what's happening.\n\nI bet if you'd have talked to your gf about hanging out with your daughter BEFORE she had to chase you down she would have been cool. Maybe disappointed, but most likely cool.\n\nNow you've disrespected her and you'll have to work very hard to ensure you don't make it a habit because she'll just keep feeling more disrespected and angry each time it happens.", "INFO\n\nDoes your gf know of your custody routine with your daughter, i.e. she is over on a weekend unless she has something else on?", "A very soft YTA- you did the right thing, but should have texted your gf to let her know that your plans had changed.", "Light YTA for not telling the girlfriend, but I also think she overreacted. Like yeah, it's upsetting but you were spending time with your kid. Your girlfriend reacted with childishness and more anger than the situation warranted. She sounds jealous which is kind of gross.", "Reading the comments you would think a crime was taking place. I can totally related because I am able to forget everything at any time really, so daughter or friend or whatever, this could have happened to me just as well. On the other hand, I am totally not mad if I amforgotten because I always have a lack of time, never a lack of things to do. So if I am told can we do something tomorrow instead, I am more likley to say: great, yes, no problem (which then is also likely to cause problems in relationship because lack of disappointment\u2026). So NTA and you learned something about your girlfriend. If she is punishing you with silent treatment and NC, it\u2018s the right moment to reflect on your compatibility.", "If he had let her come over and your daughter was the one mad at you, everyone would be ripping you apart because you would be the worst dad in the world. If your girlfriend can't accept a last min change because of an honest mistake, then there's a serious talk to be had. NTA", "YTA. the issue isn\u2019t that you had to change plans, the issue is that you failed entirely to communicate this fact. i would be pissed. it\u2019s not about you wanting to spend time with your daughter, it\u2019s about you disrespecting your girlfriend\u2019s time and following that up with a completely dismissive attitude when she gets rightfully frustrated with you.", "YTA. You canceled plans for pretty much no reason and didn\u2019t even bother telling her. Is there a reason your gf can\u2019t watch TV with you guys?", "ESH. \n\nI'm sorry, but I think you are both overreacting. Forgetting an appointment can happen. When you forget, you apologise and suggest a new plan of action. Your gf reaction was also over the top for a forgotten appointment. \n\nSo either you do this a lot, make plans and don't stick with them or you are both overreacting. \n\nAnd btw, you did forget, so apologising should have been the first thing you did.", "YTA. not for spending time with your daughter, kids should always be the priority so good job putting her first. but forgetting your gf? Not letting her know that you needed some time with your kid so the plan was changing? I would be pissed too. Imagine if she did that to you.  I bet she feels unimportant and an afterthought rather than someone who matters to you.  Her reaction is a bit strong if thos is a one off situation, so I'm wondering if this is something that has happend more than once?", "Your gf has a right to be angry a bit as you forgot your commitment, but having a kid will commonly take precedence over other relationships. For people without kids or not in tune with that it takes some learning and understanding. \n\nYou did all the right things. Super cool on the dad front. \n\nIt's learning for you as well, dating with a child.", "YTA. Mostly because your gf is a whole person that deserves to be considered and you seemed to have forgotten she existed until she texted. There's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to spend time with your daughter, but you know 4-5 hours before she texted that your plans had changed when you crawled in to cuddle and watch tv. You could have texted her then. You didn't. She could be extra pissy because it's likely that on a Saturday night, she had the potential for plans elsewhere and turned them down to spend time with you- her boyfriend. And you ditched her. That's pretty crappy. I don't think anyone thinks you should ditch your kid, but you should definitely think of someone you're dating before she has to call to ask what's up.", "Mistakes happen, but I can also understand her feeling annoyed, because it is. And she has the right to feel that way, although I do think she could have been a little more understanding. You should just apologize and promise to try and not let it happen again. Even if it was a mistake we still have to take accountability and learn from it.", "This is one of those \u201cNot enough information to answer.\u201d However, unless I\u2019ve read something wrong, my immediate reaction is NTA.\n\nWhen did OP tell the girlfriend she could come over on Saturday? If he mentioned it in passing on Monday and it was never addressed again, that\u2019s not a fleshed-out plan. If she said \u201cWill I see you this weekend?\u201d And he replied \u201cYea, we should do something on Saturday,\u201d and it never went further than that, why didn\u2019t she follow up when he didn\u2019t? Maybe he said \u201cYou should come over Saturday night after daughter and I have the day together,\u201d why did she wait until 10:00 PM to reach out?\n\nI\u2019m the GF of six months to a highly distracted single EOW father with a 14F child, so I get his predicament. Granted, in my case, they\u2019re always watching something together and we live together, but I can see this playing out very easily. Maybe he had every intention of calling the girlfriend by 8:30. But they\u2019ve gotten into this show and he\u2019s basking in the quality time and they\u2019re eating their ice cream, boom - it\u2019s 10:00. I can\u2019t fault someone for being fully present with their child. If I were in the GF\u2019s position, plans would be confirmed (although not expected on a custody weekend) and I would\u2019ve reached out at some point during the day and then again as it got later. What I absolutely wouldn\u2019t do, even if it bothered me enough to pout, is hang up on him and go NC. Tell me you\u2019re going to expect to be the priority without telling me, y\u2019know\u2026? \n\nNTA", "YTA\n\n You should have called her instead of making her wait all evening. She'll be better without you anyway", "NTA - mistakes happen. Spending quality time with your teenage daughter at her request would probably throw me for a loop, too. I'm sure you were excited she asked to spend the time with you as it probably doesn't happen all that often on her dime. Your girlfriend will get over it. Try your best to make it up to her, but firmly hold true - this opportunity presented itself, and it was important you took it.", "NTA for choosing to spend time with your daughter but YTA for forgetting about your girlfriend. She could have made other plans instead of sitting around waiting for you until 10pm when she texted you herself.", "ESH a little bit. It\u2019s great that you prioritize your child. You did nothing wrong by spending a great evening with your daughter. Kudos to you on that and it\u2019s wonderful that you had such a great time. I don\u2019t even think YA for forgetting about your plans. Things happen, we\u2019re all human, we all forget things. BUT, when your GF texted you, you should have stepped out to call her and explain the situation and to apologize. You\u2019re wonderful for prioritizing your daughter, and it sounds like, in the moment, you were so thrilled about this activity because she usually prefers to do teenager things, that you kind of lost your head. \n\nYour GF also sucks because, while it is legit for her to be hurt, she\u2019s a grown up and she needs to understand that your daughter is a priority. She should have expressed to that she was hurt and given you the chance to apologize. Also, this doesn\u2019t seem like something worth holding a grudge about, unless this is a common occurrence. \n\nI will add to this, because it\u2019s not clear and I see in a comment that your daughter has met your GF and does not want to spend time with her, that your daughter does not control who you date. You\u2019ve only been dating your GF for 6 months. That\u2019s not very long in the grand scheme of things and may have been early for you to introduce her to your daughter depending on how serious your relationship is (so you may want to wait longer before pushing this), but once you have a very serious relationship (think talking about moving in together), it is important that you make it clear to your daughter that while she comes first, your GF/relationship is also a priority. I wonder a bit if your GF\u2019s reaction was because she feels like your daughter doesn\u2019t like her and that she did this intentionally to prevent you from spending time with her. I\u2019m not saying your daughter did, but your GF may be aware that your daughter is indifferent to her and it sounds like you haven\u2019t pushed them to spend time together (which is good right now, 6 months in), but it may send mix messages to your GF that you introduced her, but she doesn\u2019t really spend any time with your daughter. Which means she was either important enough to introduce, but not to have your daughter get to know, or perhaps it was an impulse that wasn\u2019t really thought through. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nIf I\u2019m wrong thinking this but spending time with your daughter seems more important at that moment and I could see how you could get lost in the moment.  \n\nIf your girlfriend is behaving like this, what\u2019s her behavior around your daughter?  Like it don\u2019t sound like you push your girlfriend to the side all the time, do you?", "You should have let your GF know you had to bail on your plans. Not doing that sent the message that she\u2019s an afterthought. \n\nThe fact that you had a good reason to bail (spending time with your child) is better than if you didn\u2019t, but it still shows that you didn\u2019t think of her. \n\nI think this lack of consideration is bad, but it\u2019s not a malicious action. I\u2019m assuming you forgot, rather than actively choosing not to let her know. There\u2019s different schools of thought there. If you think intentions matter more than actions, then NAH. If you think actions matter more than intentions, YTA for failing to show basic respect to your GF.", "YTA. The only things you did wrong was forgetting to inform your gf and how you responded, you basically cancelled your plans at the last minute. Idk how is the relationship between your gf and your daughter but maybe you could have proposed her to join you.", "NTA. Yes I\u2019d be bummed if I was the gf that plans were cancelled last minute but it was for a damned good reason.

My daughter lives with her mom but she spends most weekends at mine (unless she already has plans for that weekend). Her spending the weekend at mine usually means doing something \"fun\" during the day on Saturday, she then spends the whole evening and night in her room on her phone (like all teenagers) and then going out for lunch on Sunday before I drop her off back at her moms. But this Saturday it was about 5/6pm and my daughter asked me if we could watch something together. Which was extremely out of the ordinary but I agreed obviously. We ended up binging Breaking Bad and eating ice cream in bed. But around 10pm my gf texted me asking when she could come over and I realised that I completely forgot that I said she could come over on Saturday. So I just texted her saying if we could meet up tomorrow (Sunday) instead. But then she called me and she was angry that I changed plans in the last second and I didn't even tell her. I tried to explain the whole situation and that I simply forgot but she just hang up and then she texted me saying that if I don't care about our plans she's not coming over on Sunday. And she didn't. In fact we haven't seen each other since last week.

My two cents and only throwing out there because its been asked\u2026 maybe don\u2019t date??? I myself am a single parent. I\u2019ve dated men who have their own kids. I\u2019ve always felt that single dads who \u201cmake an effort \u201c to spend time with their kids are put on a pedestal. Women on the other hand usually have the kids most of the time\u2026 aren\u2019t usually weekend parents but aren\u2019t being held to the same regards. When going into a relationship as a single parent you are making a choice to also give your time to someone else. This other person is expecting a partner. If you aren\u2019t willing to do that and give them the respect than maybe don\u2019t date. Everyone on here saying good job you prioritized your child over your girlfriend but no you made your girlfriend feel like shit by letting her know that she doesn\u2019t have a space in your life. Just like childless men are told not to date single women, I think childless women shouldn\u2019t date single dads. Single parents if you aren\u2019t willing to give as much to your partner and use the excuse of well my kids this and that then don\u2019t date. My kids are my priority which is why I am choosing not to date cause I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to give fully to another person. Until I feel I can then I know I\u2019ll need to compromise. Also I\u2019ve been on that side where I dated single dads and I myself had kids and for whatever reason as weekend parents they felt their time with their children was more valuable than my time with my children and all because he\u2019s a dad and he was doing the bare minimum. Disagree or agree\u2026 again my two cents and it\u2019s a bit of both YTA and NTA. Just don\u2019t date.

I\u2019m gonna go with an NTA I think, because my fianc\u00e9 has teenagers, and 6 months of relationship can be quite new to be introducing them into the crazy world of teens, and going somewhere as a three would probably be more appropriate than bring gf over to watch Netflix, daughter might be more responsive to meeting gf if it means she gets to go somewhere really fun whilst doing so.", "Good on you respecting your daughters boundaries here and not forcing a relationship between them", "Mate, easily NTA. Yeah, you should've told your GF, but everyone makes mistakes (very understandable while you were enjoying quality time with your daughter), and an apology would be appropriate.  \n\n\nWhat I'd be more concerned about is your GF's behaviour. You tried to re-schedule and she threw it back in your face, and hung up. It also sounds like she is now withholding affection and time, I suspect so that you adequately \"make it up to her\". In my experience this is a common tactic used by women that don't have children of their own. At least part of her wants to be your priority over your child (whether she admits it or not).  \n\n\nYou'd be wise to talk to her about this and firmly set her expectations straight. I've been very direct in the past with \"My daughter is my primary priority, you are secondary. I understand that this may be difficult for you and will respect if this relationship is not for you\". If you let her walk over this boundry, she'll increasingly do so, your daughter will figure it out and, most likely, distance herself from you and it'll do serious damage to your relationship.  \n\n\nEither your GF will be understanding and it'll be a good outcome for everyone, with a clear path forward; or she'll get upset you've called her bluff. Even in in the \"worst case\" scenario, if she breaks it off, that's still a good outcome for you and your daughter.  \n\n\nIn regards to your daughter not wanting to meet your GF, there's not a lot of information to go on, there could be many reasons (all relevant and reasonable from your daughters perspective). But I'm sure your daughter would love to hear that she is your number 1 person, that you will always do your best to be the best dad you can and to always put her interests above anyone else including your GF.  \n\n\nIf your daughter knows and feels she is loved and is valued over your GF, she is much more likely to talk to you about any thoughts or issues she is having, and by extension, more likely open to meeting your GF (but it's ultimately her choice).\n\nTreasure all the time you can spend with your daughter, you've got limited time with her & there'll always be women around.

It\u2019s absurd to say that a parent can\u2019t step out for 5 minutes. Hell, he could have also gone and gotten some more snacks from the kitchen or a glass of water or something. This was an all night activity and not something like watching a single episode of a show, where I agree, it could have waited. They were watching many episodes. It was a binge.

He isn't", "And then you apologize", "I agree with you, my fianc\u00e9 has teenagers, and shit comes up. It would be a completely different scenario if he\u2019d gone out with his friends and stood her up. But we\u2019re talking about an out the blue situation with his teenage daughter. There\u2019s a lot worse things he could be doing on a Saturday night that\u2019s for sure.", "Again, the issue isn\u2019t prioritizing his kid. It\u2019s not bothering to tell her he wouldn\u2019t make their plans until she contacted him at 10pm at night. That deserves, at minimum, a two second \u201csorry for completely forgetting you.\u201d", "I am explaining something that you aren't addressing.\n\nIt's okay that he changes the plans it's not okay he didn't contact his girlfriend to let her know because it is disrespectful to stand someone up", "Because you talk like you\u2019re 15 years old. \nMy bad tho, you\u2019re built different \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You\u2019re in love with yourself and probably haven\u2019t had a committed relationship with anyone, that\u2019s why your responses are simply, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care\u201d or \u201cso\u201d. This involves respect and being in love with another person. I don\u2019t think that OP is in love with his gf, or he wouldn\u2019t have forgotten about their plans or put her on the back burner. OP should consider not dating and just being a single dad. He\u2019s having difficulties with sculpting out time for each dimension of his life.", "Yes agreed. Wish u all the best \u263a\ufe0f", "He didn\u2019t cancel. He forgot to cancel and thereby stood her up. And maybe she hung up on him because he wouldn\u2019t apologize. As he has given no indication of doing so. \n\nYou\u2019re assuming he would have, because you recognize he did an AH move by standing her up. If he did everything right why would he need to apologize?", "OP never said he apologized. Why would he leave that part out?", "Exactly if he was doing something else besides this I would be posted but this is family and if I want to be in that family I need to understand that the kids come first. They stay kids for so long.", "Hahaha some people are ridiculous, 10pm is still early she can do something else. She must have no friends if she\u2019s butt hurt about it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "To you it\u2019s not ok, but to me it\u2019s fine. Shit happens and I can happily do something else and won\u2019t need an apology", "He was with his kid who he only sees on weekends, and so he forgot about the plans and gf. It happens especially if you\u2019re focused on you\u2019re kids and spending time together", "You try defending your personal opinion over and over it gets annoying.", "You should jump off OP\u2019s dick and jump on one yourself honey \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd42", "You too girl it was fun chatting", "I'm assuming he would have because he didn't get a chance to say anything........", "Exactly this! But also when you get into a relationship with someone with kids, it isn\u2019t some kind of pecking order for the parent that goes, child, then partner. As the partner, that kid has to come first to both of you, when you get into a relationship you become a team, so you both put the kid first wether that kid likes you or not, so with that in mind the gf is being super petty by giving the silent treatment for a week", "Ahhh I see. You\u2019re not like other girls.", "Ok, so you don't think people should respect each other's time. That doesn't mean other are insecure like you are insinuating though.", "That doesn't mean he shouldn't have apologized for standing hi GF up.", "As a dad with a daughter, the ladies in this thread are perfect. 10/10", "He got a chance in this post to say everything. And he didn\u2019t say he was going to try to apologize. \n\nAnd why would he need to? Because he was an AH."]}
