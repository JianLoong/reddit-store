My daughter lives with her mom but she spends most weekends at mine (unless she already has plans for that weekend). Her spending the weekend at mine usually means doing something \"fun\" during the day on Saturday, she then spends the whole evening and night in her room on her phone (like all teenagers) and then going out for lunch on Sunday before I drop her off back at her moms. But this Saturday it was about 5/6pm and my daughter asked me if we could watch something together. Which was extremely out of the ordinary but I agreed obviously. We ended up binging Breaking Bad and eating ice cream in bed. But around 10pm my gf texted me asking when she could come over and I realised that I completely forgot that I said she could come over on Saturday. So I just texted her saying if we could meet up tomorrow (Sunday) instead. But then she called me and she was angry that I changed plans in the last second and I didn't even tell her. I tried to explain the whole situation and that I simply forgot but she just hang up and then she texted me saying that if I don't care about our plans she's not coming over on Sunday. And she didn't. In fact we haven't seen each other since last week.

So for about 5 hours you knew you were going to hang out with your daughter instead but she didn't even cross your mind until she texted you. I feel like throwing in the daughter thing was intentional to get sympathy and skew the results. If you said you were watching TV with a friend and forgot to tell your GF you'd probably get different answers. YTA for not bothering to communicate and making your girlfriend feel like an afterthought.", "INFO- So is your gf treated like a booty call on the weekends? She was to come over at 10pm and the kid hasn\u2019t spent any time with her? How long have y\u2019all been together? \n\nIs it possible she is just tired of sneaking in at night? And then being forgotten about was the final straw?", "I'm going with YTA slightly. Prioritizing your daughter is good but you do own your GF a proper apology because cancelling plans last minute is not cool.\n\nAlso make sure to explain that your daughter wanting to hang out with you in the evening almost never happens and that you got lost in the moment. Still make sure to say you're sorry and apologize.", "N-T-A for spending time with your daughter. Your daughter should go before your girlfriend. \n\nBut Y-T-A for not informing your girlfriend about the change of plans until last second, and also completely forgetting that you even had plans with your girlfriend. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards soft YTA just because it is okay to change plans, especially when it\u2019s something to do with your own kid, but when you decide to change plans, you need to inform the person/people you originally had plans with. It is annoying to be told very last minute that there has been a change of plans.", "YTA, it's all cool you prioritize your daughter, as you should, but completely forgetting about plans with your gf? And when SHE texted to know what's going on you just went: don't really have time for you now, let's reschedule? No sorry, no nothing? Well, you seem like a good dad but a lousy boyfriend...", "YTA-you did everything right except informing your GF in a timely and respectful manor. Find a way and explain what happened. A note for you: By spending time with your daughter doesn\u2019t make you a super hero. This is the bare minimum and not an excuse for your poor behavior.  Grow up and manage your affairs.", "INFO: Have you cancelled plans last minute before? When and how often do you generally spend time with your gf (e.g., mostly weekdays, only once on weekends, multiple times per week)? What was the plan exactly that you had with your gf that Saturday?", "YTA - changing plans is ok. Forgetting your gf not.", "YTA - all the daughter stuff is somewhat irrelevant. It\u2019s great that it happened and you prioritized correctly, but really the message you gave your girlfriend is \u201cI needed to change plans, had every way and opportunity of communicating that, and completely ignored/abandoned/forgot you. My needs are more important than yours.\u201d", "YTA. Not for prioritizing your daughter, that is in fact to be commended! But you need to respect other's people time and you did not. You owe your gf a big apology.", "YTA\n\nThe issue isn't with your daughter being there - That's fine, that's a-okay, good job on putting your daughter above all else.  The issue is that you had plans with your girlfriend and blew them off at the very last second - and by last second, I mean you FORGOT entirely.\n\n  \nQuestion (just out of curiosity u/throw-aitaaakwv ):  How old is your daughter?

Change of plans and forgetting to inform  your girlfriend- it happens, and it's absolutely understandable. And forgivable.\n\nBut see the other side- she prepared, had a shower, shaved her legs and intended to visit you (maybe declined some other invitations too), and you did not even apologize for forgetting to inform her. Not good.\n\nIt's OK to prioritize a kid, but it doesn't mean that you don't owe an apology.", "YTA - you could\u2019ve shot her a text, but you forgot. Ok, well that\u2019s also a miscommunication on your end that you sprung on her in the moment.\n\nPlans change, and those changes need to be communicated.\n\nYour daughter is and should always be first to you, but since your partner is not obligated to that same #1 status, you cannot simply make last min changes as you wish on plan you previously made. Especially if you don\u2019t communicate it.", "The way I see it is a very light YTA. I fully get you want to spend time with your daughter and she unexpectedly wanted to come and watch TV with you which is nice, but you should've let your gf know, although I feel her reaction may have been over the top. Imo the fact you forgot about your gf so easily makes me wonder how much you want to spend time with her? All said and done, we all make mistakes but you definitely should've apologised, very light YTA.", "YTA for forgetting. I know it happens but you made plans and let her down. It\u2019s wonderful that you had a bonding experience with your daughter but completely forgetting that you had made plans with your girlfriend is hurtful to her. She has a right to rethink the relationship since seeing she\u2019s not a big priority to you.", "Changes of plans need to be communicated\n\nYta\n\nYour gf deserves basic courtesy\nHeck, why should she be absent when your daughter is there?\nI mean, as long as you do make boundaries clear and she does not try to order your daughter around, no problem.\n\nDaughter and gf can treat one another as guests.", "Yta- not because you prioritized your daughter (that's way cool btw).\n\nIt's bc you left your girlfriend hanging. \n\nMy partner always has good intentions, but this happened to us enough that I almost broke it off with him. He'd make plans with me and forget. Then he'd make plans with someone else.\n\nI didn't usually care if he hung out with others. I cared that he didn't find me important enough to communicate with about what's happening.\n\nI bet if you'd have talked to your gf about hanging out with your daughter BEFORE she had to chase you down she would have been cool. Maybe disappointed, but most likely cool.\n\nNow you've disrespected her and you'll have to work very hard to ensure you don't make it a habit because she'll just keep feeling more disrespected and angry each time it happens.", "INFO\n\nDoes your gf know of your custody routine with your daughter, i.e. she is over on a weekend unless she has something else on?", "A very soft YTA- you did the right thing, but should have texted your gf to let her know that your plans had changed.", "Light YTA for not telling the girlfriend, but I also think she overreacted. Like yeah, it's upsetting but you were spending time with your kid. Your girlfriend reacted with childishness and more anger than the situation warranted. She sounds jealous which is kind of gross.", "Reading the comments you would think a crime was taking place. I can totally related because I am able to forget everything at any time really, so daughter or friend or whatever, this could have happened to me just as well. On the other hand, I am totally not mad if I amforgotten because I always have a lack of time, never a lack of things to do. So if I am told can we do something tomorrow instead, I am more likley to say: great, yes, no problem (which then is also likely to cause problems in relationship because lack of disappointment\u2026). So NTA and you learned something about your girlfriend. If she is punishing you with silent treatment and NC, it\u2018s the right moment to reflect on your compatibility.", "If he had let her come over and your daughter was the one mad at you, everyone would be ripping you apart because you would be the worst dad in the world. If your girlfriend can't accept a last min change because of an honest mistake, then there's a serious talk to be had. NTA", "YTA. the issue isn\u2019t that you had to change plans, the issue is that you failed entirely to communicate this fact. i would be pissed. it\u2019s not about you wanting to spend time with your daughter, it\u2019s about you disrespecting your girlfriend\u2019s time and following that up with a completely dismissive attitude when she gets rightfully frustrated with you.", "YTA. You canceled plans for pretty much no reason and didn\u2019t even bother telling her. Is there a reason your gf can\u2019t watch TV with you guys?", "ESH. \n\nI'm sorry, but I think you are both overreacting. Forgetting an appointment can happen. When you forget, you apologise and suggest a new plan of action. Your gf reaction was also over the top for a forgotten appointment. \n\nSo either you do this a lot, make plans and don't stick with them or you are both overreacting. \n\nAnd btw, you did forget, so apologising should have been the first thing you did.", "YTA. not for spending time with your daughter, kids should always be the priority so good job putting her first. but forgetting your gf? Not letting her know that you needed some time with your kid so the plan was changing? I would be pissed too. Imagine if she did that to you.  I bet she feels unimportant and an afterthought rather than someone who matters to you.  Her reaction is a bit strong if thos is a one off situation, so I'm wondering if this is something that has happend more than once?", "Your gf has a right to be angry a bit as you forgot your commitment, but having a kid will commonly take precedence over other relationships. For people without kids or not in tune with that it takes some learning and understanding. \n\nYou did all the right things. Super cool on the dad front. \n\nIt's learning for you as well, dating with a child.", "YTA. Mostly because your gf is a whole person that deserves to be considered and you seemed to have forgotten she existed until she texted. There's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to spend time with your daughter, but you know 4-5 hours before she texted that your plans had changed when you crawled in to cuddle and watch tv. You could have texted her then. You didn't. She could be extra pissy because it's likely that on a Saturday night, she had the potential for plans elsewhere and turned them down to spend time with you- her boyfriend. And you ditched her. That's pretty crappy. I don't think anyone thinks you should ditch your kid, but you should definitely think of someone you're dating before she has to call to ask what's up.", "Mistakes happen, but I can also understand her feeling annoyed, because it is. And she has the right to feel that way, although I do think she could have been a little more understanding. You should just apologize and promise to try and not let it happen again. Even if it was a mistake we still have to take accountability and learn from it.", "This is one of those \u201cNot enough information to answer.\u201d However, unless I\u2019ve read something wrong, my immediate reaction is NTA.\n\nWhen did OP tell the girlfriend she could come over on Saturday? If he mentioned it in passing on Monday and it was never addressed again, that\u2019s not a fleshed-out plan. If she said \u201cWill I see you this weekend?\u201d And he replied \u201cYea, we should do something on Saturday,\u201d and it never went further than that, why didn\u2019t she follow up when he didn\u2019t? Maybe he said \u201cYou should come over Saturday night after daughter and I have the day together,\u201d why did she wait until 10:00 PM to reach out?\n\nI\u2019m the GF of six months to a highly distracted single EOW father with a 14F child, so I get his predicament. Granted, in my case, they\u2019re always watching something together and we live together, but I can see this playing out very easily. Maybe he had every intention of calling the girlfriend by 8:30. But they\u2019ve gotten into this show and he\u2019s basking in the quality time and they\u2019re eating their ice cream, boom - it\u2019s 10:00. I can\u2019t fault someone for being fully present with their child. If I were in the GF\u2019s position, plans would be confirmed (although not expected on a custody weekend) and I would\u2019ve reached out at some point during the day and then again as it got later. What I absolutely wouldn\u2019t do, even if it bothered me enough to pout, is hang up on him and go NC. Tell me you\u2019re going to expect to be the priority without telling me, y\u2019know\u2026? \n\nNTA", "YTA\n\n You should have called her instead of making her wait all evening. She'll be better without you anyway", "NTA - mistakes happen. Spending quality time with your teenage daughter at her request would probably throw me for a loop, too. I'm sure you were excited she asked to spend the time with you as it probably doesn't happen all that often on her dime. Your girlfriend will get over it. Try your best to make it up to her, but firmly hold true - this opportunity presented itself, and it was important you took it.", "NTA for choosing to spend time with your daughter but YTA for forgetting about your girlfriend. She could have made other plans instead of sitting around waiting for you until 10pm when she texted you herself.", "ESH a little bit. It\u2019s great that you prioritize your child. You did nothing wrong by spending a great evening with your daughter. Kudos to you on that and it\u2019s wonderful that you had such a great time. I don\u2019t even think YA for forgetting about your plans. Things happen, we\u2019re all human, we all forget things. BUT, when your GF texted you, you should have stepped out to call her and explain the situation and to apologize. You\u2019re wonderful for prioritizing your daughter, and it sounds like, in the moment, you were so thrilled about this activity because she usually prefers to do teenager things, that you kind of lost your head. \n\nYour GF also sucks because, while it is legit for her to be hurt, she\u2019s a grown up and she needs to understand that your daughter is a priority. She should have expressed to that she was hurt and given you the chance to apologize. Also, this doesn\u2019t seem like something worth holding a grudge about, unless this is a common occurrence. \n\nI will add to this, because it\u2019s not clear and I see in a comment that your daughter has met your GF and does not want to spend time with her, that your daughter does not control who you date. You\u2019ve only been dating your GF for 6 months. That\u2019s not very long in the grand scheme of things and may have been early for you to introduce her to your daughter depending on how serious your relationship is (so you may want to wait longer before pushing this), but once you have a very serious relationship (think talking about moving in together), it is important that you make it clear to your daughter that while she comes first, your GF/relationship is also a priority. I wonder a bit if your GF\u2019s reaction was because she feels like your daughter doesn\u2019t like her and that she did this intentionally to prevent you from spending time with her. I\u2019m not saying your daughter did, but your GF may be aware that your daughter is indifferent to her and it sounds like you haven\u2019t pushed them to spend time together (which is good right now, 6 months in), but it may send mix messages to your GF that you introduced her, but she doesn\u2019t really spend any time with your daughter. Which means she was either important enough to introduce, but not to have your daughter get to know, or perhaps it was an impulse that wasn\u2019t really thought through. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nIf I\u2019m wrong thinking this but spending time with your daughter seems more important at that moment and I could see how you could get lost in the moment.  \n\nIf your girlfriend is behaving like this, what\u2019s her behavior around your daughter?  Like it don\u2019t sound like you push your girlfriend to the side all the time, do you?", "You should have let your GF know you had to bail on your plans. Not doing that sent the message that she\u2019s an afterthought. \n\nThe fact that you had a good reason to bail (spending time with your child) is better than if you didn\u2019t, but it still shows that you didn\u2019t think of her. \n\nI think this lack of consideration is bad, but it\u2019s not a malicious action. I\u2019m assuming you forgot, rather than actively choosing not to let her know. There\u2019s different schools of thought there. If you think intentions matter more than actions, then NAH. If you think actions matter more than intentions, YTA for failing to show basic respect to your GF.", "YTA. The only things you did wrong was forgetting to inform your gf and how you responded, you basically cancelled your plans at the last minute. Idk how is the relationship between your gf and your daughter but maybe you could have proposed her to join you.", "NTA. Yes I\u2019d be bummed if I was the gf that plans were cancelled last minute but it was for a damned good reason.

My daughter lives with her mom but she spends most weekends at mine (unless she already has plans for that weekend). Her spending the weekend at mine usually means doing something \"fun\" during the day on Saturday, she then spends the whole evening and night in her room on her phone (like all teenagers) and then going out for lunch on Sunday before I drop her off back at her moms. But this Saturday it was about 5/6pm and my daughter asked me if we could watch something together. Which was extremely out of the ordinary but I agreed obviously. We ended up binging Breaking Bad and eating ice cream in bed. But around 10pm my gf texted me asking when she could come over and I realised that I completely forgot that I said she could come over on Saturday. So I just texted her saying if we could meet up tomorrow (Sunday) instead. But then she called me and she was angry that I changed plans in the last second and I didn't even tell her. I tried to explain the whole situation and that I simply forgot but she just hang up and then she texted me saying that if I don't care about our plans she's not coming over on Sunday. And she didn't. In fact we haven't seen each other since last week.

My two cents and only throwing out there because its been asked\u2026 maybe don\u2019t date??? I myself am a single parent. I\u2019ve dated men who have their own kids. I\u2019ve always felt that single dads who \u201cmake an effort \u201c to spend time with their kids are put on a pedestal. Women on the other hand usually have the kids most of the time\u2026 aren\u2019t usually weekend parents but aren\u2019t being held to the same regards. When going into a relationship as a single parent you are making a choice to also give your time to someone else. This other person is expecting a partner. If you aren\u2019t willing to do that and give them the respect than maybe don\u2019t date. Everyone on here saying good job you prioritized your child over your girlfriend but no you made your girlfriend feel like shit by letting her know that she doesn\u2019t have a space in your life. Just like childless men are told not to date single women, I think childless women shouldn\u2019t date single dads. Single parents if you aren\u2019t willing to give as much to your partner and use the excuse of well my kids this and that then don\u2019t date. My kids are my priority which is why I am choosing not to date cause I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to give fully to another person. Until I feel I can then I know I\u2019ll need to compromise. Also I\u2019ve been on that side where I dated single dads and I myself had kids and for whatever reason as weekend parents they felt their time with their children was more valuable than my time with my children and all because he\u2019s a dad and he was doing the bare minimum. Disagree or agree\u2026 again my two cents and it\u2019s a bit of both YTA and NTA. Just don\u2019t date.

I\u2019m gonna go with an NTA I think, because my fianc\u00e9 has teenagers, and 6 months of relationship can be quite new to be introducing them into the crazy world of teens, and going somewhere as a three would probably be more appropriate than bring gf over to watch Netflix, daughter might be more responsive to meeting gf if it means she gets to go somewhere really fun whilst doing so.", "Good on you respecting your daughters boundaries here and not forcing a relationship between them", "Mate, easily NTA. Yeah, you should've told your GF, but everyone makes mistakes (very understandable while you were enjoying quality time with your daughter), and an apology would be appropriate.  \n\n\nWhat I'd be more concerned about is your GF's behaviour. You tried to re-schedule and she threw it back in your face, and hung up. It also sounds like she is now withholding affection and time, I suspect so that you adequately \"make it up to her\". In my experience this is a common tactic used by women that don't have children of their own. At least part of her wants to be your priority over your child (whether she admits it or not).  \n\n\nYou'd be wise to talk to her about this and firmly set her expectations straight. I've been very direct in the past with \"My daughter is my primary priority, you are secondary. I understand that this may be difficult for you and will respect if this relationship is not for you\". If you let her walk over this boundry, she'll increasingly do so, your daughter will figure it out and, most likely, distance herself from you and it'll do serious damage to your relationship.  \n\n\nEither your GF will be understanding and it'll be a good outcome for everyone, with a clear path forward; or she'll get upset you've called her bluff. Even in in the \"worst case\" scenario, if she breaks it off, that's still a good outcome for you and your daughter.  \n\n\nIn regards to your daughter not wanting to meet your GF, there's not a lot of information to go on, there could be many reasons (all relevant and reasonable from your daughters perspective). But I'm sure your daughter would love to hear that she is your number 1 person, that you will always do your best to be the best dad you can and to always put her interests above anyone else including your GF.  \n\n\nIf your daughter knows and feels she is loved and is valued over your GF, she is much more likely to talk to you about any thoughts or issues she is having, and by extension, more likely open to meeting your GF (but it's ultimately her choice).\n\nTreasure all the time you can spend with your daughter, you've got limited time with her & there'll always be women around.

It\u2019s absurd to say that a parent can\u2019t step out for 5 minutes. Hell, he could have also gone and gotten some more snacks from the kitchen or a glass of water or something. This was an all night activity and not something like watching a single episode of a show, where I agree, it could have waited. They were watching many episodes. It was a binge.

I know I am 4th on my boyfriends list of priorities. His kids (9, 6, and 4) come before me and honestly, they come before him in my life as well. We both put them above ourselves because they are children who need to be cared for the best they can be. If he didn\u2019t put them above me, I would consider that a red flag and probably consider ending things. But he would never ever make me FEEL fourth in his life. Everything we do for his kids we also talk about how it affects me since I\u2019m kind of the outsider of their dynamic. If I\u2019m not comfortable with something, we find other options that work for everyone. It has been difficult and frustrating to navigate but his compassion for my position is clear as day to me. \n\nHis kids should and do come first, but that doesn\u2019t put me last. Ever. It probably helps that his kids took to me really well the very first time I met them. The two younger ones are in a battle to see who can be held and sit in my lap the most hahaha. The older one is definitely more independent but he\u2019s so sweet and loves telling me about science whenever he has a chance to. I love them so much.", "On the flip side, if you are going to date someone with kids, you have to understand that you will naturally come second to a lot of things becuase with kids, plans change unexpectedly. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Unfortunately, most of the time is not always the case. A lot of partners think they should be the priority over the their partner's kid. That's why we have so many stories of evil stepparents and kids cutting relationship with their parents because they were put to the side.\n\nOp is an asshole for forgetting and not apologizing properly, he's not for spending some time alone with his daughter.", "He also stated that he had forgotten all about the fact that she was supposed to come over. So the fact that he actually responded isn't exactly an indication that hes a great boyfriend. If she hadn't texted him 1st he would have never gotten in touch with her and she would have been left to wonder what the fuck was going on.", "EXACTLY", "One of the reasons I stop inviting my dad to the movies, was because he would always brought his wife. I have nothing against her, but sometimes I wanna hang out just with my dad. There's no sin in that.", "I didn\u2019t catch that. Yes, he does need to break it off then. Save gf the time, so she can find someone worthy of her then. He really needs to be waiting until his daughter is grown then, before dating. He is being unfair to any woman, who he would date then.", "THANK YOU. The amount of people saying that he should just invite his GF to hang out with them, it's awful. I have no respect for parents that force their kids to hangout with their new partners.", "\u201cSet her expectations straight\u201d that he has so little respect for her that he won\u2019t even bother texting her to let her know that they\u2019re plans are off? Who the fuck would put up with that?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s \u201cwithholding time and affection\u201d so much as she\u2019s just done with OP\u2019s bullshit.", "ur so dramatic", "Yeah OP is a slight AH for forgetting but it's a mistake that can happen to anyone. I'd probably be upset but let it slide if it was a one time thing and there was a sincere apology. If it happens on a regular basis, then I would rethink things.", "Especially since it seems to be pattern of him forgetting and he only posting this particular incident because he  finally suffering consequences of his forgetfulness towards her, who seems to put him on timeout or dumped him without telling him. Which seems fitting that his gf did that to him because he doesn't bother tell her change of plans at - so why should tell him it's over? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nHe a great father that remembers his daughter, but when it comes to girlfriend- he lousy....", "weaponized incompetence is not endearing lol", "We\u2019ll just have to agree to disagree", "Exactly, the OP clearly didn\u2019t have bad intentions and just wanted to reschedule. I think it\u2019s fair to assume he apologised instead of just assuming he was cold hearted and didnt. Not everyone is a bad guy.", "Yes, a few paragraphs are not sufficient to capture all the complexity of human social interactions and emotions. \n\nThat's why we have to build context ourselves in the comments. For example, you see folks asking ages on posts involving kids simply so they can import entire philosophies around what should be expected at that stage of development. That is the only way this works.\n\nIn this case, I even explained that the assumption of no \"sorry\" was based on the lack of contrition in the rest of the post. You can disagree, sure. But, why did you then choose to assume the \"negative assumption\" of me (that I was bending things against OP unfairly)?", ">Maybe you haven't been here long enough to know but trust me, the amount of negative assumptions is really bad!\n\n[Indeed](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pvxif/aita_for_not_letting_my_gf_come_over_because_i/j6msagc?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)", "For sure. He's definitely the YTA of this situation, more for not apologizing properly than forgetting because that can happen. \nBut people on the comments are acting like he ditched his GF to hang out with his buddies.", "I love this comment.", "Beautifully put.", "Absolutely, I tried to make that clear. It's not the coming second, it's the being completely disregarded as important at all that is not ok. And there are times when your partner's needs will need come before your kids' wants. \n\nDating a parent doesn't mean you have to be a disrespected doormat.", "It's not that the plans changed,it's that OP completely forgot he had plans w/ gf. He did not communicate a change in plans, instead he left gf hanging until she couldn't even make new plans. Not to mention, when you make plans and then don't respond, most people worry. \n\nUnless it is an emergency, you should never be just blowing a partner off without any notice.\n\nEven then, once in a while fine to change plans for something like a spontaneously movie night. But again, communicate that as plans change. And don't constantly change plans because partners do deserve some respect here. Kids come first, but if you can't have time for your partner, you don't have time for a relationship", "True--kids get sick, childcare falls through... HOWEVER they were binge watching Breaking Bad and eating ice cream.", "Not only that but it was after 10pm at this point when she texted, meaning she waited around all afternoon just to know when she could come by and spend time with him", "Didn't say he was a great boyfriend. I just corrected you because he DID send the exact text you described, only *late*.\n\n***Also, have you asked yourself if this fellow has ADD by chance?*** If you've ever dealt with ADD or somebody with ADD, this is a common occurance.  Forgetfulness, even and especially about things that are important enough to impact your life, is an extremely common challenge faced by persons with ADD.  The overall prevalence of current adult ADHD is 4.4%.  I'd like to know if he's diagnosed.", "I agree with these. And I will add why did Op had plans with his gf when it was his custody time with his daughter? Teens can change their mind about what they want to do and they are determined to be able to do that activity. Also didn\u2019t they have these conversations over the phone or text?", ">That\u2019s  \n my question. He\u2019s obviously not in love with his gf, to forget about   \nhaving plans with her like that. He needs to stop dating until he can   \nfree up enough time to have a gf.\n\nI also like to makeup scenarios in my head", "They have been together for 6 months!! We don\u2019t know how many 6 month relationship dad had. Or how much time he actually spends with his kid. He says every weekend but they says when she doesn\u2019t have plans.. and then says he didn\u2019t expect her that weekend. I think it\u2019s once is a blue moon and he makes time for daughter and gf when it suits him. So both are just waiting around till he can be bothered.", "I\u2019m a parent too but that doesn\u2019t mean I think it\u2019s ok to forget about plans and then not apologize.  So you think parents don\u2019t need to have basic common courtesy?", "That's what I assume. I felt like when trying to reschedule, there would have been some kind of \"oops I forgot, I'm so sorry, are you free tomorrow?\" Type of thing. English isn't his first language. Maybe OP didn't know how apparently very important it was that he put exactly what he said to his girlfriend rather than a synopsis, especially because reddit.", "I wasn't talking about you, I was talking about people in this sub in general. There's a lot of negative assumptions here that people don't question, so I found it weird that now where the assumption is positive for once we suddenly have to go with what we have. Because people never say that when the assumptions are negative.", "I definitely don\u2019t want to paint it like it hasn\u2019t been difficult at times. We all, his kids too, have our own traumas to process from life. There have been bumps in the road to find our balance. But at the end of the day, he wants me in his life and I want him in mine so we work through it together. They are my family and he treats me like I\u2019m truly theirs too.", "Unless its a constant issue (which if the kid rarely wants to hang out it doesnt sound like it is) then...people forget things. I have 100% forgot I had plans with someone until they were like \"Hey, is ____ time still good?\" Humans forget things from time to time. 1 missed set of plans if a drop in the bucket.\n\nShe didnt have time to make new plans, becuase she didnt check until BootyCall Oclock herself. Its not like she messaged him at 6 and he ignored her all night until it was too late.", "Or flip side she could have been busy all day and she forgot too which is why she didn't text him until 10pm. \nWhy was she waiting until 10 to reach out if they had evening plans? \n\nTo me, it sounds more like a routine of this is what we typically do so there probably is no set time. Which means OP saying no tonight is no good can we reschedule for tomorrow is fine.", "I have ADHD. It\u2019s not an excuse to be a bad partner.", "He\u2019s trying to base his time with his gf, around his teen daughter\u2019s unpredictable schedule. He has an open door to his teen\u2019s comings and goings every weekend. If she\u2019s 15, she can understand that her dad is allowed to have a dating life. She\u2019s even old enough to where she can share her dad for a couple of hours, every so often, on a Saturday night. I\u2019m wondering why the gf is doing this to herself, by putting up with this booty call arrangement, that flows by OP\u2019s teen daughter\u2019s schedule?", "A family man that forgets they exist.", "I totally agree with both of you.", "I didn't say it was!  I'm saying there are a lot of factor and dynamics in a relationship.  I expect you appreciate it when people are understanding of your challenges.", "Amen to that one! OP playing that good dad card to excuse his poor manners. My God! This is a 15 year old we are talking about here! She\u2019s old enough to understand that dad has a life too. He hesitated in texting his gf, because he thought her teen self would get bored and wander back to her room, to start gaming again, then he forgets gf, has been waiting five hours. What would have been so wrong with inviting gf to come over and join them? They\u2019ve been seeing each other for six months. Or even, \u201cLet\u2019s do that next weekend. I have plans this evening with \u201cCynthia\u201d. Too much of this allegiance to the kid thing is creating these self-absorbed young people, who have never had to share their world with anyone. OP might even choose to hold off on this dating thing until his daughter leaves the nest.", "She says this makes her and other women who feel this way: \"That\u2019s why we\u2019re wifey material...\"\n\nI guess women who are not okay with this aren't wifey material. Good God.\n\n\nJFC", "I think the gf should move on. The problem is he didn\u2019t think enough of her to text her that his plans changed. He made her text him after five hours. So, OP doesn\u2019t sound like good hubby material either.", "The emoji alone and your reaction to an arguement does not show maturity either", "Lol I think I see where you're coming from. You casually blow people off often. Nbd they're your friends and they're cool, so they can adjust and make other plans easily (insert eye roll here). He's old enough to have a 15 year old daughter. Assuming his gf is of similar age (approx 35-45) 10pm is not the time to begin making new plans. He basically stood her up and his first reaction wasn't an apology, it was to justify himself. YTA moves for sure."]}
