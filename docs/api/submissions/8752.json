We ended up binging Breaking Bad and eating ice cream in bed. But around 10pm my gf texted me asking when she could come over and I realised that I completely forgot that I said she could come over on Saturday. So I just texted her saying if we could meet up tomorrow (Sunday) instead. But then she called me and she was angry that I changed plans in the last second and I didn't even tell her. I tried to explain the whole situation and that I simply forgot but she just hang up and then she texted me saying that if I don't care about our plans she's not coming over on Sunday.

So for about 5 hours you knew you were going to hang out with your daughter instead but she didn't even cross your mind until she texted you.

On the other hand, I am totally not mad if I amforgotten because I always have a lack of time, never a lack of things to do. So if I am told can we do something tomorrow instead, I am more likley to say: great, yes, no problem (which then is also likely to cause problems in relationship because lack of disappointment\u2026). So NTA and you learned something about your girlfriend.

You canceled plans for pretty much no reason and didn\u2019t even bother telling her. Is there a reason your gf can\u2019t watch TV with you guys?", "ESH. \n\nI'm sorry, but I think you are both overreacting. Forgetting an appointment can happen. When you forget, you apologise and suggest a new plan of action. Your gf reaction was also over the top for a forgotten appointment. \n\nSo either you do this a lot, make plans and don't stick with them or you are both overreacting. \n\nAnd btw, you did forget, so apologising should have been the first thing you did.", "YTA. not for spending time with your daughter, kids should always be the priority so good job putting her first. but forgetting your gf? Not letting her know that you needed some time with your kid so the plan was changing? I would be pissed too. Imagine if she did that to you.  I bet she feels unimportant and an afterthought rather than someone who matters to you.  Her reaction is a bit strong if thos is a one off situation, so I'm wondering if this is something that has happend more than once?", "Your gf has a right to be angry a bit as you forgot your commitment, but having a kid will commonly take precedence over other relationships. For people without kids or not in tune with that it takes some learning and understanding. \n\nYou did all the right things. Super cool on the dad front. \n\nIt's learning for you as well, dating with a child.", "YTA. Mostly because your gf is a whole person that deserves to be considered and you seemed to have forgotten she existed until she texted. There's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to spend time with your daughter, but you know 4-5 hours before she texted that your plans had changed when you crawled in to cuddle and watch tv. You could have texted her then. You didn't. She could be extra pissy because it's likely that on a Saturday night, she had the potential for plans elsewhere and turned them down to spend time with you- her boyfriend. And you ditched her. That's pretty crappy. I don't think anyone thinks you should ditch your kid, but you should definitely think of someone you're dating before she has to call to ask what's up.", "Mistakes happen, but I can also understand her feeling annoyed, because it is. And she has the right to feel that way, although I do think she could have been a little more understanding. You should just apologize and promise to try and not let it happen again.

If he mentioned it in passing on Monday and it was never addressed again, that\u2019s not a fleshed-out plan. If she said \u201cWill I see you this weekend?\u201d And he replied \u201cYea, we should do something on Saturday,\u201d and it never went further than that, why didn\u2019t she follow up when he didn\u2019t? Maybe he said \u201cYou should come over Saturday night after daughter and I have the day together,\u201d why did she wait until 10:00 PM to reach out?\n\nI\u2019m the GF of six months to a highly distracted single EOW father with a 14F child, so I get his predicament. Granted, in my case, they\u2019re always watching something together and we live together, but I can see this playing out very easily. Maybe he had every intention of calling the girlfriend by 8:30. But they\u2019ve gotten into this show and he\u2019s basking in the quality time and they\u2019re eating their ice cream, boom - it\u2019s 10:00. I can\u2019t fault someone for being fully present with their child. If I were in the GF\u2019s position, plans would be confirmed (although not expected on a custody weekend) and I would\u2019ve reached out at some point during the day and then again as it got later. What I absolutely wouldn\u2019t do, even if it bothered me enough to pout, is hang up on him and go NC. Tell me you\u2019re going to expect to be the priority without telling me, y\u2019know\u2026? \n\nNTA", "YTA\n\n You should have called her instead of making her wait all evening. She'll be better without you anyway", "NTA - mistakes happen. Spending quality time with your teenage daughter at her request would probably throw me for a loop, too. I'm sure you were excited she asked to spend the time with you as it probably doesn't happen all that often on her dime. Your girlfriend will get over it. Try your best to make it up to her, but firmly hold true - this opportunity presented itself, and it was important you took it.", "NTA for choosing to spend time with your daughter but YTA for forgetting about your girlfriend. She could have made other plans instead of sitting around waiting for you until 10pm when she texted you herself.", "ESH a little bit. It\u2019s great that you prioritize your child. You did nothing wrong by spending a great evening with your daughter. Kudos to you on that and it\u2019s wonderful that you had such a great time. I don\u2019t even think YA for forgetting about your plans. Things happen, we\u2019re all human, we all forget things. BUT, when your GF texted you, you should have stepped out to call her and explain the situation and to apologize. You\u2019re wonderful for prioritizing your daughter, and it sounds like, in the moment, you were so thrilled about this activity because she usually prefers to do teenager things, that you kind of lost your head. \n\nYour GF also sucks because, while it is legit for her to be hurt, she\u2019s a grown up and she needs to understand that your daughter is a priority. She should have expressed to that she was hurt and given you the chance to apologize. Also, this doesn\u2019t seem like something worth holding a grudge about, unless this is a common occurrence. \n\nI will add to this, because it\u2019s not clear and I see in a comment that your daughter has met your GF and does not want to spend time with her, that your daughter does not control who you date. You\u2019ve only been dating your GF for 6 months. That\u2019s not very long in the grand scheme of things and may have been early for you to introduce her to your daughter depending on how serious your relationship is (so you may want to wait longer before pushing this), but once you have a very serious relationship (think talking about moving in together), it is important that you make it clear to your daughter that while she comes first, your GF/relationship is also a priority. I wonder a bit if your GF\u2019s reaction was because she feels like your daughter doesn\u2019t like her and that she did this intentionally to prevent you from spending time with her. I\u2019m not saying your daughter did, but your GF may be aware that your daughter is indifferent to her and it sounds like you haven\u2019t pushed them to spend time together (which is good right now, 6 months in), but it may send mix messages to your GF that you introduced her, but she doesn\u2019t really spend any time with your daughter. Which means she was either important enough to introduce, but not to have your daughter get to know, or perhaps it was an impulse that wasn\u2019t really thought through. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nIf I\u2019m wrong thinking this but spending time with your daughter seems more important at that moment and I could see how you could get lost in the moment.  \n\nIf your girlfriend is behaving like this, what\u2019s her behavior around your daughter?  Like it don\u2019t sound like you push your girlfriend to the side all the time, do you?", "You should have let your GF know you had to bail on your plans. Not doing that sent the message that she\u2019s an afterthought. \n\nThe fact that you had a good reason to bail (spending time with your child) is better than if you didn\u2019t, but it still shows that you didn\u2019t think of her. \n\nI think this lack of consideration is bad, but it\u2019s not a malicious action. I\u2019m assuming you forgot, rather than actively choosing not to let her know. There\u2019s different schools of thought there. If you think intentions matter more than actions, then NAH. If you think actions matter more than intentions, YTA for failing to show basic respect to your GF.", "YTA.

My daughter lives with her mom but she spends most weekends at mine (unless she already has plans for that weekend). Her spending the weekend at mine usually means doing something \"fun\" during the day on Saturday, she then spends the whole evening and night in her room on her phone (like all teenagers) and then going out for lunch on Sunday before I drop her off back at her moms. But this Saturday it was about 5/6pm and my daughter asked me if we could watch something together. Which was extremely out of the ordinary but I agreed obviously. We ended up binging Breaking Bad and eating ice cream in bed. But around 10pm my gf texted me asking when she could come over and I realised that I completely forgot that I said she could come over on Saturday.

My two cents and only throwing out there because its been asked\u2026 maybe don\u2019t date??? I myself am a single parent. I\u2019ve dated men who have their own kids. I\u2019ve always felt that single dads who \u201cmake an effort \u201c to spend time with their kids are put on a pedestal. Women on the other hand usually have the kids most of the time\u2026 aren\u2019t usually weekend parents but aren\u2019t being held to the same regards. When going into a relationship as a single parent you are making a choice to also give your time to someone else. This other person is expecting a partner. If you aren\u2019t willing to do that and give them the respect than maybe don\u2019t date. Everyone on here saying good job you prioritized your child over your girlfriend but no you made your girlfriend feel like shit by letting her know that she doesn\u2019t have a space in your life. Just like childless men are told not to date single women, I think childless women shouldn\u2019t date single dads. Single parents if you aren\u2019t willing to give as much to your partner and use the excuse of well my kids this and that then don\u2019t date. My kids are my priority which is why I am choosing not to date cause I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to give fully to another person. Until I feel I can then I know I\u2019ll need to compromise. Also I\u2019ve been on that side where I dated single dads and I myself had kids and for whatever reason as weekend parents they felt their time with their children was more valuable than my time with my children and all because he\u2019s a dad and he was doing the bare minimum. Disagree or agree\u2026 again my two cents and it\u2019s a bit of both YTA and NTA. Just don\u2019t date.

I\u2019m gonna go with an NTA I think, because my fianc\u00e9 has teenagers, and 6 months of relationship can be quite new to be introducing them into the crazy world of teens, and going somewhere as a three would probably be more appropriate than bring gf over to watch Netflix, daughter might be more responsive to meeting gf if it means she gets to go somewhere really fun whilst doing so.", "Good on you respecting your daughters boundaries here and not forcing a relationship between them", "Mate, easily NTA. Yeah, you should've told your GF, but everyone makes mistakes (very understandable while you were enjoying quality time with your daughter), and an apology would be appropriate.  \n\n\nWhat I'd be more concerned about is your GF's behaviour. You tried to re-schedule and she threw it back in your face, and hung up. It also sounds like she is now withholding affection and time, I suspect so that you adequately \"make it up to her\". In my experience this is a common tactic used by women that don't have children of their own. At least part of her wants to be your priority over your child (whether she admits it or not).  \n\n\nYou'd be wise to talk to her about this and firmly set her expectations straight. I've been very direct in the past with \"My daughter is my primary priority, you are secondary. I understand that this may be difficult for you and will respect if this relationship is not for you\". If you let her walk over this boundry, she'll increasingly do so, your daughter will figure it out and, most likely, distance herself from you and it'll do serious damage to your relationship.  \n\n\nEither your GF will be understanding and it'll be a good outcome for everyone, with a clear path forward; or she'll get upset you've called her bluff. Even in in the \"worst case\" scenario, if she breaks it off, that's still a good outcome for you and your daughter.  \n\n\nIn regards to your daughter not wanting to meet your GF, there's not a lot of information to go on, there could be many reasons (all relevant and reasonable from your daughters perspective). But I'm sure your daughter would love to hear that she is your number 1 person, that you will always do your best to be the best dad you can and to always put her interests above anyone else including your GF.  \n\n\nIf your daughter knows and feels she is loved and is valued over your GF, she is much more likely to talk to you about any thoughts or issues she is having, and by extension, more likely open to meeting your GF (but it's ultimately her choice).\n\nTreasure all the time you can spend with your daughter, you've got limited time with her & there'll always be women around.

It\u2019s absurd to say that a parent can\u2019t step out for 5 minutes. Hell, he could have also gone and gotten some more snacks from the kitchen or a glass of water or something. This was an all night activity and not something like watching a single episode of a show, where I agree, it could have waited. They were watching many episodes. It was a binge.

I've had relationships where I consistently bent over backwards to please somebody, but they'd still go nuclear the first time they didn't get their way.", "When you're inconsiderate, neglectful, or otherwise a jerk to someone, going \"I didn't do it on purpose (I just don't care enough to treat you with baseline courtesy)\" won't cut it.\n\nIf you want someone to date you, man or woman, gay or straight, you have to put in a bare minimum of effort, respect and courtesy.  Otherwise, why should anyone date you?  What are you bringing to the table?  Simply not being intentionally malicious isn't enough.", "I dunno. He didnt leave here waiting a resturant alone. She was just coming over to hang. Ive had friends fall alseep while I was waiting for them to come over. Ive had friends get caught up with their kids and forget we had plans. Ive forgotten plans in the past. Hell, my HUSBAND has forgoten we had plans. There is a massive difference to me, in repeat behavior, and a one off. If I get \"stood up\" once becuase someone got distracted with their kid, Im gonna rib them about it, but Im not giving them the silent treatment for a week. The complete lack of being willing to communicate like an adult is far more deserving of a YTA then forgetting to cancel plans. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Clearly, Im in the minority though.", "You are such a wonderful stepmom and person. We need more people in the world like you.", "I think it was genuine forgetfulness. He's at fault, but being blindsided and forgetting is different than being a straight up AH.", "I definitely don't see this man as an asshole either. I would have prioritized the daughter too. Especially since she's at that age where she only wants to be in her room playing on her phone. She reached out to him to spend time with her. You have to! They're gone so soon. I think she's a bad girlfriend for not seeing that. If you're dating someone seriously, and planning on making a commitment to them, you would want to see if they're a good parent. Right?? Unfortunately, Some women would rather than men choose them over everyone, including their children.", "I agree - adult life does have accidents and forgetfulness in it. And couples have to be forgiving to make it through. I don't understand the down votes?", "His GF was absolutely stood up - forgetting about her and their plans is the definition of stoodup.\n\nRescheduling after huge apoligies and mea culpas was called for.", "Exactly! I fortunately got really lucky and met the man of my dreams who the first words he said to me after I told him he would have to be the #2 man in my life because my son will always be #1 was good because if it were any other way I wouldn\u2019t want to be with you.  My son is now 16 and he loves that man more than his own father.  \n\nEvery man that had an attitude with me having to cancel or reschedule was dropped like a hot potato immediately.  They weren\u2019t worth my time and they weren\u2019t worth being in my son\u2019s life.  \n\nPersonally, I agree the GF is being immature and selfish.", "Exactly! Everyone is like totally just celebrating the bonding with his daughter.. and thats great... but he did stand her up on accident and she does deserve an apology!", "His comments show he didn't offer an apology until the call the next day. \n\nGood partners, like good parents, make sure the people for whom they care always feel valued, respected, and important no matter the circumtances. He not only forgot her, he also didn't give her the respect of taking responsibility and apologizing right away when it was brought to his attention. *That's* why it's YTA.", "Thinking that someone else's time is so worthless you neither need to communicate to them nor apologize for forgetting plans with them is still an AH thing though."]}
