{"id": 6641, "submission_id": "104uiiv", "title": "AITA for telling my mother she hasn't been a mother to me?", "selftext": "When I (23f) was 11 years old, my parents divorced. There was no cheating or scandal involved, they just weren\u2019t a good match (my mother being very emotional and sensitive and my father being a rather rational and cold person). My father moved out and me and my little sister stayed with our mother, who fell into depression after the divorce. She stopped doing the household and just laid in her bed for hours after work. So at a fairly young age, I started to care for the house. I cooked, I cleaned, I did laundry, I made sure my sister did her homework. Since my mother didn\u2019t want to lose her face in public, she acted as if everything was normal. Nobody knew about her depression. On the outside she put on a happy face, but at home she would just cry and lay around. Since I was always occupied with housework or caring for my little sister, I didn\u2019t have much time or energy to make any friends. I became a social outcast at school and experienced some brutal bullying. I never told anybody about it.\n\nThings got better when I was 15 and my mother met my stepfather. He is an amazing person and helped her get back on her feet and took over the majority of the house work. With this I was finally able to have some free time and make friends. At this point, I was already functioning independently and as my mother was getting better, she wanted to actually parent me, which obviously didn\u2019t work. We fought a lot I chose to go live with my father. Even though my father isn\u2019t the most loving person, he always made sure I had what I needed and he respected me. I\u2019ve lived there for 3 more years and got my own apartment when I turned 18. During that time I would visit my mother once or twice a month and we stayed friendly, but never got close. I resented her for what she put me through.\n\nNow that my sister has also moved out, my mother and stepfather want to move abroad to a tropical country on the other side of the world. They have planned everything for over a year, sold almost all their stuff and are leaving next month. I am genuinely happy for them. \n\nTwo weeks ago, I found out that I got pregnant by my long term boyfriend and we are really excited. I told my mother and she started crying because she won\u2019t see the baby when it\u2019s born or be a proper grandmother because she doesn\u2019t want to return to the \u201cplace that made her depressed\u201d and I don\u2019t want to fly around the globe with a baby. This is where I might be the AH. I told her it\u2019s her decision to move to the other side of the world and I didn\u2019t expect her to want to be a grandmother. She asked why and I said because you haven\u2019t even been a mother. She tried to defend herself and said she was depressed and couldn\u2019t do any better during that time, which is hard, but she could\u2019ve asked for help and not expect an 11 year old to do everything. She then called me a heartless B and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.

I understand your mom was going through a hard time but to have your 11 be doing all the house work and caring for your other child, and then acting in public as if that isn't the case. Unacceptable. \n\nIf I were you I'd honestly go NC with your mom. She seems selfish and like she only cares about herself.", "NTA, she should have put on a happy face in front of her children and gotten help for her depression instead of worrying about her social image. \n\nActions have consequences and hers are that she will never have a connection to her daughter or grand children.", "NTA She was old enough to understand what she was going thru and could have got help. What she did to you was parentification. Her grandmother expectations are ridiculous. She chose to leave and does not want to come back. This is her choice and her actions have consequences. This is no different than anyone who moves away from family and then complains about a lack of family time. Tell your mom that she can watch her grandchildren grow up on FB (set up a separate account and keep it private if necessary)", "Congratulations with your pregnancy! \n\nNTA - You told her the hard truth, but it is the truth. Also, what mother calls their child a B?", "NTA. Parentification is a form of abuse which she inflicted on you because she valued her reputation more highly than your wellbeing. She doesn't have the right to deny the truth just because it makes her uncomfortable. In that way she hasn't changed at all.", "NTA, but your mom is the AH for valuing her social image and reputation over the well-being of her own kids", "You did nothing wrong.  Your feelings are valid.  Curious to know what your sister thinks about this.\n\nNTA", "NTA - you told her the truth. She doesn't like it and thinks that makes you cold, but that's not correct, *it makes you honest*.\n\nYou were left to take care of things and parent your sister. She provided a house, awesome, but that's NOT all it takes to parent. Good for you for putting it out there.", "NTA. When you have children, you should protect them from everything, including your own depression. \n\nHaving dealt with this myself, you should always tell someone you need help. \n\nAt 11, you should not have had to deal with what you did, and regardless of what was going on with her, she needs to acknowledge that.", "I\u2019m kind of torn between N T A and N A H though I\u2019m leaning more toward NAH with soft N T A   \n  \nYou\u2019re not the asshole because you\u2019re entitled to your feelings. She had a job to do and didn\u2019t do it. And it fell on your shoulders. It would take a lot of shadow work and therapy for you to *not* have resentments toward her.   \n  \nThat being said, as someone diagnosed with depression, I can tell you from experience that it can absolutely immobilize you and mess with your executive function. And as with other mental illnesses, you usually can\u2019t see how it\u2019s impacting others around you.   \n  \nMy main concern, however, is that it doesn\u2019t sound like your mother has truly healed from her depression, between blaming it on a place and her reaction to your very valid feelings. If she was truly doing the work, she would be able to recognize the validity of your feelings and looking to work with those feelings to try to rebuild your relationship rather than throwing a temper tantrum. My guess is that she\u2019s still quite depressed, using your stepdad as a distraction, and thinks running from it to some tropical place halfway round the world will be the magic \u201ccure\u201d that won\u2019t require her to put in the hard work. Until she\u2019s there and still depressed, then what? Blaming it on not being able to see her grandchild? She definitely could benefit from therapy.   \n  \nBut so could you, if for nothing more than for help processing your feelings.", "Overcoming depression must have taken a lot from everybody. But clearly, she hasn't yet accepted, what effect she had on the people surrounding her or as one might say it \"what she did while being sick\". This is another step and admitting so / asking for forgiveness yet another step.   \n\nBut all that ain't your problem, let her move and figure it out by herself. No need to apologize, you don't need to enable her distorted version of the past.   \n\nNTA", "I'm going to go with NAH here, and I'll tell you why: because I've seen things from both perspectives, and they're all bloody horrible.\n\nI was also parentified at 11, when my dad had a complete breakdown and turned into an abusive monster. My mother didn't know how to cope and just shut down, which left me in charge of housework, cooking, and care for my younger siblings (one of whom is developmentally disabled). I hated and resented my mother for the hell she put me through, and cut her out of my life completely in my 20s.\n\nNow, in my 40s, one of my closest friends is going through something similar to what your mother experienced. Her marriage broke down, she's a single mum to two kids (one with ADHD, one with autism), and she is barely functional. She's in therapy, on meds, with some government respite assistance, but she hates her life and cries herself to sleep most nights.\n\nMost of all, she hates herself: for not being the mother she wishes she could be, for her perceived \"weakness\", her emotional instability, etc. She's terrified that her kids will grow up to despise her because of how broken she is, but she has literally nothing left to give, and few options to get out of the hole she's in.\n\nYou were honest with your mother about how she was never a parent to you, and that's fair. You needed to express that to her, and she needed to understand why you've never been close. That said, it's also important to remember that our parents are/were people too, and since we weren't in their brainpans at the time, we really don't have complete firsthand awareness of the darkness they were battling.\n\nThat doesn't mean you need to forgive her. I'll never speak to my mother either, because I know I can never forgive her for a lot of the stuff she did, nor do I want her in my life. But maybe this awareness can help everyone involved shift perspective a bit if and when we ever find ourselves repeating patterns or being in similar circumstances.\n\n<3\n\n\\*edited typo", "NAH. You both dealt with a lot and you both needed help you didn't get.", " NAH\n\nSomeone's feings are hurt.\n\nAnnouncement is made.\n\nNow you have a person who doesn't live anywhere remotely close to where the action is and they feel excluded, hurt, sad, etc. All the typical emotions for this type of situation. This person doesn't have the self awareness to see the way they are acting and will blame others for every issue they have.\n\nThink about situations throughout your life that were not ideal and total up how many times this person blamed the issues on everyone else.\n\nYou are fine OP. Live your life, don't let someone else decide your life for you.", "YNA. You're mom is being unreasonable. You will be a mother of a new born which is as you know a more than full time job. She will be a retiree in some tropical paradise. If she wants to see the kid its on HER to come back to you. Don't let her guilt you! And best wishes for the coming child.", "NTA", "YTA. Your mother had an ILLNESS. Depression is a health problem, and just because she didn't have blue spots all over her face, doesn't mean she wasn't SICK. You just don't see it that way. You were a child, you had it really hard because she wasn't functional; and that has tainted your relationship/perspective of her. She lost out too: she lost years of her life, she lost out on a great relationship with her children. If she had a choice - don't you think she would rather have been out getting mani-pedis and having ice cream with her girls, over being in a dark mental headspace, paralyzed in bed for so many years? She was SICK, this is not something she could just change her mind about or fix by herself. You say she should have 'asked' for help: No she couldn't, that's part of how depression works, she was trapped in her own darkness/headspace. Society had/has a victim-blaming problem with Depression/Alcoholism/Obesity and many other mental/physical health issues. Which is what you are doing.
