They live in my house,  in an apartment downstairs.  They are a family member to my spouse. In the first place, I told them I didn't want anyone living in our apartment.  They begged saying they would be homeless or have to \"live in the ghetto.\" (Their words, not mine!) As they were getting their house worked on and can't live in it while it's being done. My spouse caved and said ok. We have 3 under age kids. Also my daughter 21 and her bf 22 all living upstairs with us. The youngest is 7. I told them from the start that it's LOUD in the apartment. There is no insulation between floors. That the kids run and play, we have pets that also run and play . They said it was fine and they had kids before and it wouldn't bother them a bit. They've made underhanded comments about the kids and noise before. But today the text said that they have been woken up 5 times today by the kids. That it isn't just walking, it's running, bouncing,  playing above their heads. Now to clarify some things. It's 4pm on a Saturday . They do not work on weekends.  Only 1 of them works during the day through the week. The 1 person has some health issues they have been fighting for a bit, but honestly,  they are one of those people who ALWAYS have something healthwise going on. They never have a healthy moment and most times, it's a pretty sketchy story about their health. In privacy of the home they are perfectly fine, but exiting the house, it's a show of limping, acting in pain, etc .  I have not sent a text back , it's been hours. My first reaction is to say very ugly things to them. I didn't. I've just been simmering on it. My MIL told me to tell them that maybe it's time to find another place to live, since their health situation has changed, and us upstairs being a family of 7, has not. I also want to tell them that it's absolutely ridiculous to expect children in their own home to be quiet at 4 pm on a Saturday afternoon!! Would I be the A$$h0l\u20ac if I told them that it's time to move along?", "created_utc": 1700957769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183xng2/wibta_for_telling_my_neighbor_she_should_just_move/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My spouse is easy going and something like this would just roll off their back.

They need to either deal with it or find somewhere else to live.", "NTA. Sounds like you have a classic case of choosey beggars. You explicitly told them you didn\u2019t want anyone occupying the downstairs of your house, they insisted and assured you it wouldn\u2019t be an issue, then complained because there were expected noises coming from the upstairs that is occupied by SEVEN people. They can deal with you and your family living in your own home, or move. They\u2019re not owed anything from you.", "NTA I would reply that it\u2019s only going to get much louder with the holidays and school vacation and that you will not be quiet. It may be best they find another living arrangement more suitable for them. Then break out of the pots and pans and start banging on them like Animal from the muppets.", "NTA your MIL is correct. And I'm also really happy for you that your MIL actually has your back lol", "NTA - tell them to move.", "You don't have to tell them to move (although for the life of me I can't understand why you ever let them move in), but I would let them know in no uncertain terms that they knew what they signed up for, and that you would not be adjusting your or your children's behavior one tiny bit. They can deal with it, or find other accommodations.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - keep to the high road, just tell them sorry it didn't work out for them. And since they're family, you won't worry about standard things like 30 day notice, etc. They can just let you know when their last day will be and you'll be happy to help them clean up their space after their things are removed.", "NTA, but hate to break it to you, if they have been living there a while vs. just staying a week or two they almost certainly have tenant rights.  If they don't want to 'just move along\" you will have to evict them, which can be a lengthy process. Especially going into winter, where some States do not allow evictions for families with children or those with disabilities during winter months. Do you have any lease/signed agreement with them? How long have they been living there? You may need to consult an attorney about your rights and standing.", "NTA\n\nYou do realize that you also have a SPOUSE problem.  You did not want those people there and your spouse unilaterally told them they could come.  \n\nOnce you get them out (if you ever do), make it clear to your spouse that there will be no future unilateral decisions.", "I'd respond to their note with one of my own. \"I'm so sorry you're finding it too noisy living here. I was afraid that this would be the case. Well be sorry to see you go but I imagine you'll want to find a place that is more quiet and better suited to your lifestyles. It's been nice having you.\"", "ESH -- you because of the ableism \"there always seems to be something wrong with them\" and implying that they're faking because you don't like their attitude... And them because their attitude sucks. Don't get me wrong they're obnoxious but it's shitty of you to act like they're faking their illness because you don't like their behavior. And they are assholes way way more than you could ever possibly be for complaining about your family knowing both the size of it and knowing your extreme generosity in letting them live there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We have multiple rental properties so we absolutely can do an eviction if need be. We've done it multiple times. They do not have children, nor a disability.  They keep trying to apply for disability for multiple reasons each time and get denied. There is a contract,  because it is through a company who is paying their rent for them and fixing their house. In the rental agreement it says we can cancel the agreement at any time but we have to give them 60 days to move and find a new place.", "Ty and yes Absolutely! Hit the nail on the head. I love my spouse. But they are a pushover and definitely doesn't like to tell anyone no. It's probably the only fights we ever have. They think things are no big deal and just let's things go when theres a problem. But I feel like if I let people walk all over me , they'll continue to do so forever.", "My fault I didn't go into details. My spouse is disabled. So I 100% didn't mean to come off as heartless . Doctors have told this person that there is nothing wrong with them. Multiple times. They have filed for disability for over 8 years.  Each time, with a new ailment. Every time,  been denied, they come up with something else wrong with them that has nothing to do with the last ailment. Several family members have privately called them out for it. Tried to get them help, as it seems to be a mental illness more than a physical. Especially when a few have gone to doctor appointments with them and been confirmed there is nothing wrong with them. CAT scans, MRI's , x-rays, blood tests. Everything has come back negative. The point of bringing it up, is that because of the recent ailment, they said they have been sleeping all day and my kids needed to stop being loud. While the ailment did not affect them this whole week during fun festivities,  until today. The first day my children were home having fun. I get people with disabilities mental and physical have good days and bad, it isn't my children's responsibility nor mine to stay silent to appease them. Especially when no one is sure what will be going on with them next.", "They knew it would be noisy but they didn't understand what \"family of 7\" noisy meant.", "Dance parties in the kitchen!

Look up your city/state/county noise ordinance, forward it to them and let them know in no uncertain terms that you already abide by it.
