Mental illness is too far to leap when he doesn't know if she has a sleep disorder that gave her a hyperrealistic dream to create this scenario.

At one point I had an alien abduction - hint it was not real but the experience felt very real. I am of sound mind also.

No cars, but a pair of red and white lights were following him (he reckoned they were 50 feet behind him) so he freaked out. He sped up, they followed. He slowed down, they slowed down. He started driving like a nutter and they kept pace. On tight corners he felt they accelerated to be so close that he could see them through tight bends, never wavering from the chase. He said he\u2019d asked god for help etc etc but, nope, they chased. He figured the gig was up and decided he\u2019d have to stop at the pub so that, maybe, he\u2019d be safe. Maybe other people in the pub would help fight off the aliens that wanted him?\n\nAnyway, he bursts through the doors, terrified. We calmed him down, heard the story of his 20 mile car v spaceship chase and, because I\u2019m sciencey, I asked him if he had a parcel shelf in his boot (trunk) and any reflective stuff in there. He was carrying a mirror and he had no parcel shelf. It was his rear lights reflecting onto the mirror and up onto the rear window.\n\nPoint is, there\u2019s normally a perfectly logical explanation.

I think a lot of these stories start when something difficult is going on in these people\u2019s lives, big or small, and then they begin to notice \u201cweird\u201d things. \n\nThe human brain is incredibly good at creating stories and piecing together sensory data to support those stories even if nothing in the \u201creal world\u201d can support that interpretation.

It might also be some kind of defense mechanism that hopes unstoppable aliens messing with you will make the real world problems seem more manageable, I don\u2019t know. The point of this rant is that what seems to cause people to claim alien abductions is complicated and variable, and can often fall between an intentional lie and clinical mental illness. OP\u2019s wife most likely wants it to be true on some level and something caused her to start accepting most likely innocuous things as evidence she\u2019s being abducted. \n\nWhether she\u2019s having or is heading towards a full on mental break isn\u2019t something I can determine, but whatever is happening it\u2019s apparent her connection to the reality typically accepted by other people has come apart in places and it\u2019ll probably be hard if not impossible to help her put it back together. Not that it\u2019s not worth trying, but when the problem is a deep belief like this, generally someone isn\u2019t going to reassess that just because others are telling them to.
