Sooner or later, that attention won't be enough and she'll simply manufacture something else.  \n\n\nBarring medical intervention, your happy marriage as you knew it is over.  Hopefully you can find a solution that doesn't destroy your own credibility as well.", "NTA. Unless someone is having some kind of mental heath break these are usually chalked up to sleep paralysis. \n\nHer adamance about this is alarming and if she refuses to stop and get help she\u2019s giving you no choice but to do what\u2019s best for yourself.", "It seems like this is not going to get better, especially with her attending local meetings with other UFO enthusiasts, she will be influenced more and more and these new people will validate her truth/ideas/perceived reality more and more. They will hold much more sway with her than you will. It sounds like she may not be able to believe a therapist either since she's just so into it all.", "NTA.  But since it sound\u2019s like your wife may be struggling with a mental illness, I don\u2019t think your own reputation should be your primary concern in this situation.", "If this is real.. \n\n- Your wife\u2019s beliefs have been there before the relationship, and you knew this\n- She now fully believes that she\u2019d been abducted, while you were in bed next to her\n- She\u2019s not the first or the last to believe this, and she\u2019s not the first or last to share publicly\n- I don\u2019t think her beliefs have been \u201cin good fun\u201d all this time, and I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s been a joke all this time either. These are her true beliefs\n- You have full rights to be concerned for your work reputation, especially since you are in the scientific field \n- Edit: Took out the part where your colleagues don\u2019t understand mental illness well because a commenter pointed out that believing in ETs is similar to a religion. And there actually are a few or more religions out there that surround extraterrestrials. \n- I\u2019m not sure if any explanation, facts, scientific logic will help your wife, cause these beliefs are ingrained just like your science is concrete to you \n\n\n\nOP, I don\u2019t see how this can end well? She\u2019s a firm believer of other beings in outer space, and you\u2019re a man of science.

I mean you could, but aside from possibly being an asshole, that\u2019s not going to have the outcome you\u2019re hoping for.

Internet sleuthing would have be believe it was probably an alien abduction. I'm not really someone who would believe in that, but I truly can't say it wasn't because it was that.... unexplainable of an occurrence. It only happened once, and I don't experience anything like sleep paralysis, delusions, etc. So I mean... who's to say what happened to her...\n\nAlthough I haven't, and wouldn't, tell anyone about it but my husband.

Your wife needs help. Find a good counselor ASAP.", "NTA. I truly hope that you\u2019re able to get your wife to agree to seek some help. I don\u2019t think that you fighting her on what she believes is the best course of action to help persuade her, however. If she truly believes this (and she may well), it could be a tumor. She could be having a break with reality. Any number of things, physical, mental, environmental, could be a contributing factor. Is it possible that you\u2019re able to get her into seeing, bare minimum, her physician?  While HIPAA prevents her medical providers from telling you anything, without her permission, you\u2019re quite free to bring up your concerns, privately. Regardless, YOU should seek a therapist of your own, to help you navigate the best course of action for your own mental wellbeing.

Delusions can\u2019t be reasoned with. Her mind literally cannot question the reality of the delusion and it can\u2019t fight being fixated on it. I think you should take her to a psych ER and apologize profusely for acting like a condescending jerk instead of being concerned.", "Your wife needs serious mental help. I don\u2019t say that sarcastically. She seems ill, if she truly believes she was abducted by aliens. YTA for not getting her help before now.", "No YNTA\u2026 she\u2019d be angry at you for it obviously, but getting her help is a good idea. Things could escalate, she could become so obsessed that it ruins your relationship.\n\nI obviously don\u2019t know whether or not aliens exist, but vivid hallucinations, delusions, and \u2018false\u2019 memories, can be signs of mental illness, or neurological problems.\n\nYou definitely need to get her professional help, if she continues down this road, it could become much worse, and it can ruin you marriage. But she will hate you for it, even if it\u2019s for her own good.\n\nI\u2019m saying all this off my own knowledge, I know a fair bit about psychology, but I know nothing about science, so maybe aliens do exist?

Would you advise someone whose spouse is deeply religious that the s/he has a mental illness because of they believe everything that happens is God's will? Most people will not call that mental illness. Point: No one should judge that way because the world cannot say  deity, or extraterrestrial life, are false. Do you see what I mean? Both can be real. Mental illness is too far to leap when he doesn't know if she has a sleep disorder that gave her a hyperrealistic dream to create this scenario. I have had sleep paralysis and had one dream that was so real I had to use every bit of thought I could muster to know what it really was --- and I read about these things constantly so knew what really happened. His reputation should be his concern as well as her well-being.", "I saw an alien ship when I was 7 or 8 years old. Next morning, I definitely told my entire family. At that age, I was too young to understand the complexity that would have to go into creating a lie like that. Describing the ship, where it was, how big it was, how it moved while stationary. The light that circled four houses, coming from a point I couldn\u2019t see from my vantage point on the third floor. I ducked the light a few times, when it came close. But\u2026.eventually, I didn\u2019t. Then I don\u2019t remember anything, except waking up in the morning. It was just too detailed for a child that young. Too many parts to fit together. Of course, they dismissed it. \n\n30 years later, I had another dream of trying to swat brilliant lights out of the way, while I was lying in a table. Either a repressed memory, or they came back. I feel like it was the latter.", "Yeah I had something happen- not alone- that I really have no explanation for. I believe aliens could be real cuz the universe is huge, but I\u2019ve never been someone who believed they are capable of or give a shit about visiting or studying earth so never bought UFOs and such.\n\nBut I have one event that if I experienced it alone I would probably have gotten a ride to a hospital out of fear something was wrong mentally. Idk if I wanna go full \u201cit was alien abduction\u201d but it weirdly fits how some dumb shows and movies do the topic funny enough lol. Whatever it was, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something currently explainable.", "Prove it's a delusion right after you prove that the six billion people on earth that believe in deity all are right. See? Aliens: nope! Deity: yep! What? Logic 101. None of it has been unequivocally proven so maybe aliens are just as real as religion.", "Let's look at this logically.\nAliens with the intelligence to travel potentially lightyears across the galaxy or from somewhere much closer - either way more intelligent than you me or your hamster.\n\nComing here they think:\n\n\"Oh I know let's abduct some human to poke and prod and examine.\"\nAlien B: \"Let's pick up that homeless person there on that street.

Why is that accepted without scientific proof when aliens are not? It's all the same. Something more powerful than us can fix or break us, scare or love us, blah blah. Yes, you're right, maybe she was!", "Yes, well, there is no God so when someone believes they lived through a severe illness because they prayed, they should be taken to a psych ward, too. No I'm not being obtusely contradictive. I'm just making a point that to many, religion is just as preposterous as alien abduction. Stop judging unless you want to say people who believe in Bigfoot or worship deity are mentally ill. I don't believe in alien abductions, but I don't believe in Odin, either.
