Mental illness is too far to leap when he doesn't know if she has a sleep disorder that gave her a hyperrealistic dream to create this scenario.

At one point I had an alien abduction - hint it was not real but the experience felt very real. I am of sound mind also.

That\u2019s cold hard statistics my dude. Though I imagine if those aliens ever showed up to investigate us they took one look and peaced the fuck out. \n\nAs far as the existence of a god\u2026 well that\u2019s your own personal matter of belief to figure out. I\u2019ve never seen any evidence of the existence of a god, and what I\u2019ve seen has convinced me that if they exist, they\u2019re total dicks.", "Probably because if they actually shared their experiences, they'd be facing thousands of \"faker u liar u tHiNk iM dUmB?/!1!??!\"", "Because they haven't thought of it yet.", "Englando is not my first language :( in my language it is actually spelled Ockham.  Seems his name is reported in both variations but thanks for the input.", "I\u2019ll copy the same thing I said to the OG commenter\n\nBut the comment (they) made about ppl believing in \u2018abstract aliens\u2019 not making up story\u2019s is disingenuous to imply that is the same king of alien belief as the \u2018ufo/visitors\u2019 kind are the same kind of belief in aliens, when they\u2019re not.\n\nAn analogy would be a person who believes in a god but isn\u2019t very religious becoming more religious later, even though they have taken it further than when you met, you already knew they were a god believer.\n\nIt\u2019s not like the conspiracy theory and ufo belief came out of nowhere one day, OP knew about it before, even if she has taken it further now", "But the comment you made about ppl believing in \u2018abstract aliens\u2019 not making up story\u2019s is disingenuous to imply that is the same king of alien belief as the \u2018ufo/visitors\u2019 kind are the same kind of belief in aliens, when they\u2019re not.\n\nAn analogy would be a person who believes in a god but isn\u2019t very religious becoming more religious later, even though they have taken it further than when you met, you already knew they were a god believer.", "I think aliens kidnapping this woman is more likely than god, if I'm being honest.", "what a day to have eyes.", "I would be interested to see this analysis. Do you have a link to the study or the numbers?", "According to my very wise imaginary friend, the probability of unicorns existing is 24,6589%.", "Complete and utter nonsense. You should feel shame for believing this.", "No, and you don\u2019t know that I\u2019m not an alien either. For all, you know, I could actually be one I\u2019ll be trying to tell you something. But that\u2019s the whole point, nobody knows. And until it is completely disproven scientist can\u2019t Baggett because they\u2019ve got no evidence to prove otherwise.\nSomething I was taught specifically by my statistics teacher. When I was at university was that scientists and statisticians should only deal with things that they can actually measure and proof. If they can\u2019t do that, they should stay out of that particular area. Hence why no one has done a study to prove if there is a God because there\u2019s no way to measure it. Just like there\u2019s no way to measure if there are only in abductions apart from the fact that there are thousands of people who have clean so.", "Which language? I can't seem to find any where it's spelled that way.", "When I say believe in aliens, I don't mean the idea that the universe is so big that there must be life somewhere. I mean people who believe that they are visiting and flying around and shit. I've met plenty of people who believe that and I don't know anyone who has claimed to be abducted. There are plenty of people who believe in that specific thing, who just watch alien abduction documentaries and stuff. I don't think it's foolish to not expect it to escalate to harmful levels when it doesn't for most people. You're the one who takes \"into ETs and UFOs\" and \"all in good fun\" and decides to represent that as \"active conspiracy theorist\". It would be more like someone who goes to a regular church, who respects her husband's atheism, suddenly thinking that God had spoken to her personally. Yes she believed in God and the Bible and God spoke to people in the bible, so she believes that, but most religious people don't make that leap where they claim to have experienced his voice in their heads.", "Based on what? The feeling in your pinky?", "Ok. Let's say that aliens come to earth is inevitable to happen at this point in history. First' let's establish the following (nearly impossible) assumptions.\n\n1. Other life exists in the universe. (low probability)\n2. This other life somehow manages to develop just like us and get even more developed technology than us (one in tens of millions chance)\n3. Alliens, out of all the galaxy everywhere, come to our planet specifically.\n4. They come at specifically this time in the billions of years of history. I don't want to even get into how low probability that is.\n5. They abduct, out of the billions of available people, specifically this woman, who happens also to be an UFO conspiracy theorist. (What a coincidence!). This is only a one in billions chance. \n6. Then, they return her after one day, because...?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, I'm going with god on this one.", "Are you shocked by my factual statements?", "Sure, hang on. I'll go ask my buddy for the link to his indie podcast where he covers all of it, in between advertisements for Super Male Vitality and bigfoot sightings.", "It\u2019s not possible to prove a negative.

She said she was experimented on that does leave marks. As others have actually client before and have gone to hospital and have actually had incisions in them.", "The village in Surrey (England) that I understand William to have come from is called Ockham.
