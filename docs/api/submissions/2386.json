I was scrolling through Instagram but after the first two cuts I noticed there was a massive amount of hair on the floor. I asked her why there was so much hair on the floor and she said my hair was really damaged.\n\nI got up and looked in the mirror and she had cut it at basically my shoulders (for context, my hair is basically to my ass). I asked her what the fuck she was thinking and she just repeated that it was damaged like some sort of malfunctioning spam call program.\n\nI looked at a few chunks of undamaged hair in the mirror and there was 1, maybe 2 at most inches of split ends. I asked her why in the everliving fuck she had basically cut off 2 feet of hair for no reason and she now said \u201cI accidentally cut off a bit too much\u201d.\n\nI pretty much had to let her finish because there was already too much gone to do anything else about it, so she kept cutting and then claimed she had \u201cmade it uneven by mistake\u201d so she took even more off.\n\nIn the end, I was left with basically a bob cut at my chin. I was pissed as hell so I grabbed my school shit and a few clothes and drove over to my dad\u2019s house. About an hour later, my mom came over to pick me up and take \u201cher\u201d car (my parents split the payments with me 50/50, so she doesn\u2019t own it) and told my dad \u201cit\u2019s her custody week and she\u2019s just being a typical upset teenager\u201d.

Cutting off 2 feet of hair is no accident. It was deliberate.", "NTA at all. I truly don\u2019t understand how someone can accidentally turn a dead-ends trim into cutting off 2 feet of hair. And then she\u2019s just going to stand by her actions? While saying she wouldn\u2019t want the same thing done to her hair? I hate to say it but this seems intentional. Your mom needs help.\n\nNinja edit: FURTHERMORE you said you noticed the large amount of hair on the floor after 2 cuts? So in the first 2 cuts she took it up to your shoulders. There is no way this wasn\u2019t on purpose. I\u2019m so angry for you.", "NTA, it wasn't a mistake she cut that much off. Never let a parent cut your hair unless you want a buzz cut or they're a stylist/barber.", "You asking her to butcher her own hair like your own is the most inspiring thing I have read today! NTA! I am so sorry for the loss of years of hair growth! That's traumatizing.", "NTA, cutting someone's hair without their permission is considered assault in some places. It's different with a parent and a child I think, but the same concept still follows. She violated what you wanted and she said she would do, and it's not a small mistake either, it will take you years to grow back what she cut off. The fact that she even tried to be upset at you over it is astounding, even if we ignore the fact that she literally went to her ex husband's house and tried to take your car.", "Sounds like you're entitled to be annoyed with your mother, and she's just trampled all over your boundaries without so much as a by-your-leave.\n\nShe really didn't \"try to do something nice for you\" if she cut off two feet of your hair when you were expecting her to trim the ends.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Unfortunately this seems like jealousy and some other unresolved issues. Your hair is an extension of yourself and she took it upon herself to literally chop up your trust in her by cutting off all your hair and worse being unapologetic about and petty. Glad your dad is there for you and in the mean time they make amazing extensions for affordable prices now if you need some camouflage, I had a bad haircut from a salon and had to do this.", "First off, you, the child, cannot \u201cviolate\u201d the custody agreement. It is between her and your father. In fact, based on your age, you likely have the power to adjust it to your liking, at this point, were it ever to be addressed in court.\n\nSecond, find out in whose name the car is, because I have a feeling this will not be the last time she declares it \u201chers\u201d and tries to manipulate you with it. See if it can be in your father\u2019s name only.\n\nThird, let this be a lesson to you as you enter adulthood. Adults make mistakes, and the mature ones own up to them and apologize. Mature adults also respect autonomy. You would have lived with split ends for a few more days. You will live now, and your hair will grow back, but the point is she didn\u2019t need to \u201csolve the problem\u201d then and there. She should have stopped when she realized she was out of her depth and let you get evened out by a stylist/barber.", "Sounds like she didn't like your hair being that long and took the opportunity when it presented itself.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If I had fucked up my daughter's hair and hurt her feelings I would feel so guilty I'd be sick. I would be apologizing and offering to get a matching cut immediately. It makes me feel like crying even thinking of doing something like that. I don't know what your mother is thinking, or what she may be going through, or what your relationship is like, but I can tell you nothing you could have done would deserve this. I'm so sorry, I hope you come to love your new cut and that you get the apology you deserve.", "NTA. You asked to cut of some ends, not 2 whole feet. As someone with long hair I could not imagine losing all of it from my ass to my shoulders.", "NTA\n\nFirst off, fuck the custody agreement. She sounds like the type who would be thrilled if you left your dads house early if he ever some way violated your trust or privacy. Best part here is when you offered her a taste of her own medicine and she was like \u201cWhat, no why would I want my hair to look like yours?\u201d", "I'm a hairstylist and I would never do this to my kids! They have asked but I refuse. Now color yes. She did it on purpose. NTA. I would ask your dad to talk to his lawyer about it.", "NTA.

She did it intentionally", "NTA\n\nStay with your dad. \n\nThe car complicates the situation with your mom. The name on the title determines ownership, not who makes the payments. If your moms name is on the title, legally she can take that from you.\n\nIf you trust your dad, this could be a good time to get the title of the car sorted out so that he passes it to you when you turn 18. \n\nYou may need to get the courts involved now to show that you are staying with your dad and to force her to put the title in your dad's name.", "NTA, and I like your potential resolution of your mother getting a similar cut; it's telling that she refused.

First of all I want to say I'm so sorry this happened to you even when you plan to cut off a lot of hair it can be so traumatizing but what your mom did is just downright cruel. My father did this to me when I was young because he didn't like the color of my hair took me to the hairdresser told me we were getting it trimmed I end up walking out of there with just a couple of inches of hair like a pixie cut I think I cried for a week! I can't believe she did this to you and it unfortunately seems intentional I don't blame you for going to your father's at all but for what it's worth I'm sure you look great either way and I saw someone mention extensions which really can look real and help with your confidence while your hair grows. Good luck and sorry your mom sucks the fact that she refused to cut her hair the same way speaks volumes Mom is the only ah here.", "INFO: had she mentioned any complaints about your hair pre cut? Were you both in any conflict beforehand?", "ESH.\n\nI can definitely understand your frustration because our hair is part of what defines us and makes us feel beautiful.  Losing your gorgeous locks is a sudden change that you were just not ready for and your mom was out of line in cutting that much off.  She should have known you wanted just a trim, and perhaps an in depth conversation beforehand would have helped.  Every mother around the world has made this horrible decision to cut the hair of their child, and most of the time it is a horrible idea!  Mine used tape to mark a \"straight line\" and used old scissors from a dirty junk drawer that were NOT sharp, but hey...it grew back!  \nCool off a bit and hang with dad and then look at some photos online on some style ideas.  You might be pleasantly surprised at how sexy shorter hair can be and how fun and easy it can be to manage!  It brings out some lovely features!  Make that appointment at the salon to fix it up a bit into a style that suits your pretty face and go pick up some mousse and hairspray and have some fun!", "ESH. Lot of judgment calls on all sides. But maybe she did a mistake with your hair. As a not professional in the hair cutting business i can only say it is hard to do evenly and right. Also your dad threaten to call the cops is an interesting move. You are understandably not happy but your mother tried. Also you demanding her to let a professional cut her hair short isn't really the best move and makes a bad impression on me. If you really KNOW she did this with intent you should have written it that way, but it seems to me like an amateur cuttin hair and doing a bad job.", "Maybe MAYBE if she had cut 1-2 inches off, realized it was crooked, and then tried to fix it by cutting off 1-2 more, that might've been a genuine mistake.  But going from her butt to her shoulders was clearly deliberate.", ">Never let a parent cut your hair unless you want a buzz cut or they're a stylist/barber.\n\nOr even if they are. My mom used the opportunity of cutting my hair to engage in experimentation, so a lot of times at the end I just shaved it all off.", "This. A friend of mine\u2019s father forced him to get a buzz cut as a child, and even 40 years later you could see the pain it caused him when he talked about it. My nephew had long hair all the way through elementary and middle school. His mom said as long as he kept it clean, he could wear it however he wanted.", "That was not an accident", "She's 17 so leave the word sexy out point blank. And no,no decent mother would butcher their child's hair like that, it's not just hair to alot of people,the mother did that on purpose to hurt her child, ops NTA the mother is a huge one.", "Hair clear down to her waist to a bob under her chin is a HUGE \"mistake\" to make.  If she's THAT bad with scissors, she should never have had them in her hands at all for fear she'd cut off her own fingers.", "\\*shrugs\\* as an amateur i can only say it is hard. Also threatening with the \"call the police\" and hatin each other seems so much better in the long run...", "Cutting one or two inches, realizing it was crooked and then cutting one or two inches off is much different than chopping it clear to her shoulders on the first couple cuts.  And I say that as an amateur that has cut my family's hair before.  You can always take more off, you can't put it back on."]}
