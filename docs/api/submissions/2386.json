And then she\u2019s just going to stand by her actions? While saying she wouldn\u2019t want the same thing done to her hair? I hate to say it but this seems intentional. Your mom needs help.\n\nNinja edit: FURTHERMORE you said you noticed the large amount of hair on the floor after 2 cuts? So in the first 2 cuts she took it up to your shoulders. There is no way this wasn\u2019t on purpose. I\u2019m so angry for you.", "NTA, it wasn't a mistake she cut that much off.

I am so sorry for the loss of years of hair growth! That's traumatizing.", "NTA, cutting someone's hair without their permission is considered assault in some places. It's different with a parent and a child I think, but the same concept still follows. She violated what you wanted and she said she would do, and it's not a small mistake either, it will take you years to grow back what she cut off. The fact that she even tried to be upset at you over it is astounding, even if we ignore the fact that she literally went to her ex husband's house and tried to take your car.", "Sounds like you're entitled to be annoyed with your mother, and she's just trampled all over your boundaries without so much as a by-your-leave.\n\nShe really didn't \"try to do something nice for you\" if she cut off two feet of your hair when you were expecting her to trim the ends.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Unfortunately this seems like jealousy and some other unresolved issues. Your hair is an extension of yourself and she took it upon herself to literally chop up your trust in her by cutting off all your hair and worse being unapologetic about and petty. Glad your dad is there for you and in the mean time they make amazing extensions for affordable prices now if you need some camouflage, I had a bad haircut from a salon and had to do this.", "First off, you, the child, cannot \u201cviolate\u201d the custody agreement. It is between her and your father. In fact, based on your age, you likely have the power to adjust it to your liking, at this point, were it ever to be addressed in court.\n\nSecond, find out in whose name the car is, because I have a feeling this will not be the last time she declares it \u201chers\u201d and tries to manipulate you with it. See if it can be in your father\u2019s name only.\n\nThird, let this be a lesson to you as you enter adulthood. Adults make mistakes, and the mature ones own up to them and apologize. Mature adults also respect autonomy. You would have lived with split ends for a few more days. You will live now, and your hair will grow back, but the point is she didn\u2019t need to \u201csolve the problem\u201d then and there.

If I had fucked up my daughter's hair and hurt her feelings I would feel so guilty I'd be sick. I would be apologizing and offering to get a matching cut immediately. It makes me feel like crying even thinking of doing something like that. I don't know what your mother is thinking, or what she may be going through, or what your relationship is like, but I can tell you nothing you could have done would deserve this. I'm so sorry, I hope you come to love your new cut and that you get the apology you deserve.", "NTA. You asked to cut of some ends, not 2 whole feet.

First of all I want to say I'm so sorry this happened to you even when you plan to cut off a lot of hair it can be so traumatizing but what your mom did is just downright cruel. My father did this to me when I was young because he didn't like the color of my hair took me to the hairdresser told me we were getting it trimmed I end up walking out of there with just a couple of inches of hair like a pixie cut I think I cried for a week! I can't believe she did this to you and it unfortunately seems intentional I don't blame you for going to your father's at all but for what it's worth I'm sure you look great either way and I saw someone mention extensions which really can look real and help with your confidence while your hair grows. Good luck and sorry your mom sucks the fact that she refused to cut her hair the same way speaks volumes Mom is the only ah here.", "INFO: had she mentioned any complaints about your hair pre cut? Were you both in any conflict beforehand?", "ESH.\n\nI can definitely understand your frustration because our hair is part of what defines us and makes us feel beautiful.  Losing your gorgeous locks is a sudden change that you were just not ready for and your mom was out of line in cutting that much off.  She should have known you wanted just a trim, and perhaps an in depth conversation beforehand would have helped.  Every mother around the world has made this horrible decision to cut the hair of their child, and most of the time it is a horrible idea!  Mine used tape to mark a \"straight line\" and used old scissors from a dirty junk drawer that were NOT sharp, but hey...it grew back!  \nCool off a bit and hang with dad and then look at some photos online on some style ideas.  You might be pleasantly surprised at how sexy shorter hair can be and how fun and easy it can be to manage!  It brings out some lovely features!  Make that appointment at the salon to fix it up a bit into a style that suits your pretty face and go pick up some mousse and hairspray and have some fun!", "ESH. Lot of judgment calls on all sides. But maybe she did a mistake with your hair. As a not professional in the hair cutting business i can only say it is hard to do evenly and right. Also your dad threaten to call the cops is an interesting move. You are understandably not happy but your mother tried. Also you demanding her to let a professional cut her hair short isn't really the best move and makes a bad impression on me. If you really KNOW she did this with intent you should have written it that way, but it seems to me like an amateur cuttin hair and doing a bad job.", "Maybe MAYBE if she had cut 1-2 inches off, realized it was crooked, and then tried to fix it by cutting off 1-2 more, that might've been a genuine mistake.  But going from her butt to her shoulders was clearly deliberate.", ">Never let a parent cut your hair unless you want a buzz cut or they're a stylist/barber.\n\nOr even if they are. My mom used the opportunity of cutting my hair to engage in experimentation, so a lot of times at the end I just shaved it all off.", "This. A friend of mine\u2019s father forced him to get a buzz cut as a child, and even 40 years later you could see the pain it caused him when he talked about it. My nephew had long hair all the way through elementary and middle school. His mom said as long as he kept it clean, he could wear it however he wanted.", "That was not an accident", "She's 17 so leave the word sexy out point blank. And no,no decent mother would butcher their child's hair like that, it's not just hair to alot of people,the mother did that on purpose to hurt her child, ops NTA the mother is a huge one.", "Hair clear down to her waist to a bob under her chin is a HUGE \"mistake\" to make.  If she's THAT bad with scissors, she should never have had them in her hands at all for fear she'd cut off her own fingers.", "\\*shrugs\\* as an amateur i can only say it is hard. Also threatening with the \"call the police\" and hatin each other seems so much better in the long run...", "Cutting one or two inches, realizing it was crooked and then cutting one or two inches off is much different than chopping it clear to her shoulders on the first couple cuts.  And I say that as an amateur that has cut my family's hair before.  You can always take more off, you can't put it back on.", "NTA your mom sounds jealous of your hair to me. You and your dad can go to court and get custody change your old enough now to choose.", "NTA - There was a post similar to this yesterday. I have no idea why parents think just because they can pick up a pair of scissors that they can cut hair properly. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.", "NTA Wow!  That was deliberate and such a shitty thing to do.  Then she demands \"her\" car back.  Your mom needs professional help.", "NTA but honestly ask your dad if he would be willing to go to court to change custody plan, your old enough to have this be your choice, and hay she did was traumatic and deliberately done,", "Is she jealous of you by any chance? This is not an accident. NTA.", "There is no other salon near you so your mom had to do this? She manipulated you for some reason.

I didn't speak to her for 3 weeks and wore a cap or a hat for months, everytime I was out of my room. She never touched my hair again (I was 15, now 40)\n\nIn your case, I would not have contact with my mom until my hair has grown back to what it was before the cut. Thrust has been broken and it is not something that is easily repaired.\n\nBut like I said, I'm petty AND stubborn. Feel free to do what's best for you.", "NTA.  Taking off a couple of inches would have been all that was necessary.  Even if she cut off 4-5 inches, it wouldn't have been too bad (considering how long her hair was), but to take off 2 feet wasn't an accident.  This was done on purpose.  No wonder OP doesn't want to be with her mother at this point.\n\nThe mother was clearly in the wrong here and owes OP a huge apology.", "NTA at all. I'm so petty I'd tell her I'd see her again when my hair had grown out and then just stopped talking to her", "NTA your mother is a massive asshole. There is no way that was an accident. I don't know if she is one of those disgusting people who get jealous of their children but it sure sounds like something like that. She sounds completely unhinged. I'd be worried for your safety if you stay in that woman's house. I would permanently stay with your father from now on and try not to let her be a part of anything including paying part of your car. Do not let that insane asshole have any kind of control over you. This is so off I wouldn't even meet her outside of a public well populated area.", "I  would go back and cut her hair off in her sleep, then move in with my dad full time.", "My spacial awareness and physical coordination are poor. I think I could easily cut 6 inches off in error. For this reason I would never go near anyone's head, and especially not my own child's, with scissors. \n\n2 foot in someone is, I agree, no accident.", "OP pointed out that mother dearest also has really long hair. I bet this was a jealousy issue.", "In the UK cutting someone's hair like this is criminal assault.", "My mother did this to me when I was in college. Talked me into a small trim and then cut my hair to the top of my shoulders. She kept laughing like a hyena and saying \"Whoops\". My hair was so long it used to get caught in my car door all the time. I got so many compliments on it I guess she couldn't stand it. The only thing I could do was act like I didn't even care. She was a mean girl mother.", "If it were truly an accident she would have apologized. That to me she biggest indicator of deliberate action. The complete lack of remorse.", "This. \n\nDuring the first Lockdown I asked my mom to cut my angled bob (she'd done it before with better results than the salon) and she had a brainfart and cut the angles upwards from the back instead of having the back as the highpoint of the cut. Mistakes happen. \n\nBut a whole two foot of hair isn't a mistake. And if it were, she'd have been apologetic from the moment she noticed she was going wrong.", "Should\u2019ve told OP then. Not continued to cut off an excess amount without her consent", "I\u2019m mad FOR the OP. Not a stylist, but I cut my husband, dad, and son\u2019s hair. But I ALWAYS make sure it\u2019s what they want. And if my sister wanted her hair cut, you can bet I\u2019d be YouTubing the heck out of it first. What is wrong with people?", "Hair can be sexy and yes...parents do dumb crap.  My point was not to stay angry, but to make the best out of a super crappy situation.  \n\nI don't know their relationship in general so I can't say if the mother is spiteful and did it on purpose or if she really did think the hair was dead...or if she was jealous of her hair!   Who knows...we don't know much more than what is written here.  I do know that the best way to move forward is to try to make it work...and watch mom with scissors in the future!", "While your advice is practical, the tone suggests the OP \"get over it\" while she takes steps to make the situation tenable. This \"we all make mistakes, let's forgive each other\" mindset only works when the person in the wrong understands and regrets the harm they've caused. OP is feeling angry, hurt, and betrayed by her own mother. The very least a mother would offer is a heartfelt apology, surely?", "Oh come off it, this wasn't an \"oh it's crooked\" issue, it's cutting off **two whole feet**."]}
