Your mom needs help.\n\nNinja edit: FURTHERMORE you said you noticed the large amount of hair on the floor after 2 cuts? So in the first 2 cuts she took it up to your shoulders.

It's different with a parent and a child I think, but the same concept still follows. She violated what you wanted and she said she would do, and it's not a small mistake either, it will take you years to grow back what she cut off. The fact that she even tried to be upset at you over it is astounding, even if we ignore the fact that she literally went to her ex husband's house and tried to take your car.", "Sounds like you're entitled to be annoyed with your mother, and she's just trampled all over your boundaries without so much as a by-your-leave.\n\nShe really didn't \"try to do something nice for you\" if she cut off two feet of your hair when you were expecting her to trim the ends.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Unfortunately this seems like jealousy and some other unresolved issues. Your hair is an extension of yourself and she took it upon herself to literally chop up your trust in her by cutting off all your hair and worse being unapologetic about and petty.

See if it can be in your father\u2019s name only.\n\nThird, let this be a lesson to you as you enter adulthood. Adults make mistakes, and the mature ones own up to them and apologize. Mature adults also respect autonomy. You would have lived with split ends for a few more days. You will live now, and your hair will grow back, but the point is she didn\u2019t need to \u201csolve the problem\u201d then and there.

Were you both in any conflict beforehand?", "&#x200B;\n\nI can definitely understand your frustration because our hair is part of what defines us and makes us feel beautiful.  Losing your gorgeous locks is a sudden change that you were just not ready for and your mom was out of line in cutting that much off.  She should have known you wanted just a trim, and perhaps an in depth conversation beforehand would have helped.  Every mother around the world has made this horrible decision to cut the hair of their child, and most of the time it is a horrible idea!  Mine used tape to mark a \"straight line\" and used old scissors from a dirty junk drawer that were NOT sharp, but hey...it grew back!Cool off a bit and hang with dad and then look at some photos online on some style ideas.  You might be pleasantly surprised at how sexy shorter hair can be and how fun and easy it can be to manage!  It brings out some lovely features!  Make that appointment at the salon to fix it up a bit into a style that suits your pretty face and go pick up some mousse and hairspray and have some fun!", "ESH. Lot of judgment calls on all sides. But maybe she did a mistake with your hair. As a not professional in the hair cutting business i can only say it is hard to do evenly and right. Also your dad threaten to call the cops is an interesting move. You are understandably not happy but your mother tried. Also you demanding her to let a professional cut her hair short isn't really the best move and makes a bad impression on me. If you really KNOW she did this with intent you should have written it that way, but it seems to me like an amateur cuttin hair and doing a bad job.", "Maybe MAYBE if she had cut 1-2 inches off, realized it was crooked, and then tried to fix it by cutting off 1-2 more, that might've been a genuine mistake.  But going from her butt to her shoulders was clearly deliberate.", ">Never let a parent cut your hair unless you want a buzz cut or they're a stylist/barber.\n\nOr even if they are.

Also threatening with the \"call the police\" and hatin each other seems so much better in the long run...", "Cutting one or two inches, realizing it was crooked and then cutting one or two inches off is much different than chopping it clear to her shoulders on the first couple cuts.

I do know that the best way to move forward is to try to make it work...and watch mom with scissors in the future!", "While your advice is practical, the tone suggests the OP \"get over it\" while she takes steps to make the situation tenable. This \"we all make mistakes, let's forgive each other\" mindset only works when the person in the wrong understands and regrets the harm they've caused.

Maybe I'm just a spiteful person, but in my minds eye, I see Momma waking up from a nap with much shorter hair.", "My mum did the same to me, she would cut all of our hair when we were kids and the last time I ever let her touch my hair was when I was about 11 or 12. Normally she\u2019d measure it out and do the proper precise cuts but this time she\u2019d been trying to get me to cut it quite short and I\u2019d said no (she wanted it just below my ears - it was down to my mid back and I wanted to keep it long and just take a few inches off). So she pretended to agree, but when she went to cut it she pulled all my hair into a bunch behind my back and then did one big snip and was like \u2018all done!\u2019. Even as a kid I could tell straight away that it was wrong, it would be all uneven! At the front my hair was now the length I\u2019d wanted but it was waaayy shorter at the back!

I\u2019ll have to even it out now.\u2019 So she gave me the haircut she wanted and I had to just deal with it, I couldn\u2019t even call her out on what she did. I hated the look, it took me ages to grow it back out, it was too short to stay in a ponytail which was annoying because I played a lot of sports. I lost a lot of trust in my mum because of that, she completely disregarded what I\u2019d told her I wanted for my body and did whatever she wanted and then lied about it.
