Rob was complaining to us about his relationship troubles with his recently wed wife, Kayla (F35).\n\nRob and Kayla have a complicated past, but I'll do my best to summarize. They met and started dating about a bit more than a decade ago. After about two years of dating, Kayla dumped Rob, as she thought they weren't a good match. Rob was devastated so he didn't really pursue any relationships after that point aside from a few short flings.\n\nRob and Kayla met again earlier this year after Kayla divorced her husband. After chatting with Rob for a few months, they got married, and she along with her two kids (M7 and F5) moved in with Rob. Trust me, this all seemed rushed to me and my other friends, but Rob wasn't having any of it, as according to him, Kayla the kids are his pride and joy and he loves them more than anything.\n\nNow, after being married for a few months, Rob seems a little disillusioned with the relationship. He says he loves Kayla and the kids with all his heart, but working full-time, being a husband, and father exhausts him. This reached a boiling point. He told us about how the day before yesterday, he and Kayla had an argument. She thought he didn't do enough around the house. He argued that he was exhausted from work, playing with the kids and helping them with their homework, etc. They argued but long story short, it ended with him getting sentenced to the couch.\n\nRob was fuming, but my other friends and I told him that the only way to get off the couch was by apologizing and admitting fault. My other friends agreed with me since we've all been there. He said that he wanted to wait and see if Kayla would attempt to communicate first, but I told him that was futile. When he insisted he'd wait, I laughed and told him it was useless. Rob seemed offended and said I was an asshole for \"making light of his situation.\" Despite all this, Rob was somewhat happy since he was \"relieved\" that Kayla felt comfortable enough with dishing out the sentence. But nonetheless, he was pissed with it.\n\nThe night ended shortly afterward. When I got home, my wife wasn't impressed that I laughed at him being sent to the couch. She said it was different for Rob compared to myself and my other friends since he and Kayla's relationship is more \"complex\". She said that it was rude, but I honestly don't see it considering how Rob got himself into this mess and can easily get himself out of it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703970338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18upqx7/aita_for_laughing_at_my_friend_after_his_wife/", "score": 322, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Men use more lethal methods in their suicides.\n\nCDC data demonstrates that men account for over 76% of suicide deaths in the United States each year. The CDC also found that there are 3.3 male suicide deaths for every female suicide death. In contrast, in research studies, women are two to three times more likely to discuss thoughts of suicide than men, and there are approximately three female suicide attempts per every one male suicide attempt.\n\nhttps://cams-care.com/resources/educational-content/the-gender-paradox-of-suicide/\n\nIf you\u2019re interested.", "She's tired of doing the things she needs to do for HER kids, after six months of living with her new husband and working part time a few hours a day?
