Rob was complaining to us about his relationship troubles with his recently wed wife, Kayla (F35).\n\nRob and Kayla have a complicated past, but I'll do my best to summarize. They met and started dating about a bit more than a decade ago. After about two years of dating, Kayla dumped Rob, as she thought they weren't a good match. Rob was devastated so he didn't really pursue any relationships after that point aside from a few short flings.\n\nRob and Kayla met again earlier this year after Kayla divorced her husband. After chatting with Rob for a few months, they got married, and she along with her two kids (M7 and F5) moved in with Rob. Trust me, this all seemed rushed to me and my other friends, but Rob wasn't having any of it, as according to him, Kayla the kids are his pride and joy and he loves them more than anything.\n\nNow, after being married for a few months, Rob seems a little disillusioned with the relationship. He says he loves Kayla and the kids with all his heart, but working full-time, being a husband, and father exhausts him. This reached a boiling point. He told us about how the day before yesterday, he and Kayla had an argument. She thought he didn't do enough around the house. He argued that he was exhausted from work, playing with the kids and helping them with their homework, etc. They argued but long story short, it ended with him getting sentenced to the couch.\n\nRob was fuming, but my other friends and I told him that the only way to get off the couch was by apologizing and admitting fault. My other friends agreed with me since we've all been there. He said that he wanted to wait and see if Kayla would attempt to communicate first, but I told him that was futile. When he insisted he'd wait, I laughed and told him it was useless. Rob seemed offended and said I was an asshole for \"making light of his situation.\" Despite all this, Rob was somewhat happy since he was \"relieved\" that Kayla felt comfortable enough with dishing out the sentence. But nonetheless, he was pissed with it.\n\nThe night ended shortly afterward. When I got home, my wife wasn't impressed that I laughed at him being sent to the couch. She said it was different for Rob compared to myself and my other friends since he and Kayla's relationship is more \"complex\". She said that it was rude, but I honestly don't see it considering how Rob got himself into this mess and can easily get himself out of it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703970338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18upqx7/aita_for_laughing_at_my_friend_after_his_wife/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Men use more lethal methods in their suicides.\n\nCDC data demonstrates that men account for over 76% of suicide deaths in the United States each year. The CDC also found that there are 3.3 male suicide deaths for every female suicide death. In contrast, in research studies, women are two to three times more likely to discuss thoughts of suicide than men, and there are approximately three female suicide attempts per every one male suicide attempt.\n\nhttps://cams-care.com/resources/educational-content/the-gender-paradox-of-suicide/\n\nIf you\u2019re interested.", "She's tired of doing the things she needs to do for HER kids, after six months of living with her new husband and working part time a few hours a day? Sounds like she didn't get the sugar daddy she hoped for.", ">I suspect she's more frustrated about cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, getting the kids washed up / in bed / dressed for school, managing appointments, etc\n\nYup, you hit the nail right on the head. Its these sorts of tasks that she brought up to him", "I don't think, I'm victim-blaming rather my friend is being stubborn and proud. In situations like this, it is often easiest to apologize, and then restart the conversation in good faith.\n\nAlso, as the guy literally tells us, his favourite time of day is at night when he's massaging this woman's feet while she tells him about all her problems and stresses. Doesn't exactly strike me as an abusive relationship", "Yes, I can agree abusive. Maybe OP would feel better if it was described as \"manipulative.\"", "I hope they don't get divorced since overall he seems very happy. That being said, I told him to get a prenup but he refused as it would be insulting to her in his view", "Thank you for this correction.", "You seem to be in the \"happy wife, happy life\" mindset in that everything he has to do has to placate her and treat her like a princess. What is he getting out of the relationship?", "> In situations like this, it is often easiest to apologize, and then restart the conversation in good faith.\n\nThis is true when both parties are acting in good faith. You're applying what would work in your own marriage and it doesn't apply here.\n\nBut also, abusive relationships have ups and downs. It's not like they're always bad. If they were, nobody would stay in them. It's that when the abuser gets their way, it's 'good', and when they don't, it's not good. \n\nBesides, what he's saying is his favorite part of the day is something that is literally him existing for her benefit. That's like a woman in an abusive relationship saying that her favorite part of the relationship is giving him blowjobs. Like, there's nothing wrong with enjoying that, but if that's the highlight then the relationship might be hella one-sided.", "Does anyone listen to his problems? Doesn\u2019t sound like she does and you sure don\u2019t either.", "Here's a thought: What happens if your friend ignores his wife's pronouncement and simply lies down in his bed?\n\nHer reaction to that would say a lot.", "So he spends all day working, helps the kids with homework, massages his wife\u2019s feet while she vents about whatever her issues are, she still yells at him and won\u2019t let him sleep in his bed, and you don\u2019t think he\u2019s being abused by his wife? Or at least being taken advantage of? We\u2019re saying she\u2019s abusive towards him, not the other way around.", "Who's in denial now?", "I think having a happy wife is part of having a happy life, that being said. I completely disagree with the viewpoint that making your wife happy will automatically make your life happy, that's simply impossible", "It could also be the fact that he spent more than a decade wishing they never broke up", "I've got no idea how she'd react. That being said, my friend has expressed that despite circumstances he is happy that \"she feels comfortable enough\" sending him to the couch", "I won't jump to the conclusion that there's abuse here, but the way you present your friend's behavior definitely raises concerns. It seems to be an one-sided relationship and your friend is stuck. \n\nWhat's more, nobody has the right to kick you out of your bed. When my husband and I have arguments, we still sleep in our bed, and once when our fight was too intense, I was the one who decided for myself to sleep on the couch. Adults don't kick their spouses from their beds if they truly respect them.\n\nBe a better listener for your friend and make sure he knows he has a strong support system in you.", "yeah that's not evidence at all. Abusive relationships in general are literally addictive, they hijack the brain's reward pathways in the same exact way that drugs and gambling do, partly due to the unpredictable nature of when the affection is going to come. The positive feelings associated with affection are much more intense when you don't know if it's gonna be a good interaction or a bad one.\n\nThere are plenty of stories of women who are happily married, have kids and are with wonderful spouses, and then they randomly go back to the ex who beat the shit out of her because they feel unfulfilled in the healthy relationship because the feelings are less intense.\n\nHim pining after her for a decade is not evidence that it *is* abusive, but it's definitely not evidence against either.", "And she\u2019s only too happy to use that against him.", "That's doesn't matter. Both my cousin and sister have been in relationships where their exes legit almost unalived them, but they missed them when they left and they got back with them. Your friends' marriage sounds emotionally and mentally abusive from the small nit you gave us about her. Or at the very least, she's taking advantage of him. Maybe talk to him more about their dynamic.", ">Him pining after her for a decade is not evidence that it is abusive, but it's definitely not evidence against either.\n\nAbsolutely crazy that you had to say this."]}
