I video myself opening the advent calendar each day whilst giving my verdict. At the end of December, I compile a report and the videos and send it off to the company for that very important consumer feedback. As Hugo is in my life this year, I managed to get him on board with the review. I have small team, myself and my best friend usually doing it but it seemed even better that Hugo would now participate.\n\nAnyway, a lot has happened in the build up to Christmas; The daily grind of work, getting my 10,000 steps in and battling a cycle of colds. This has meant I was delayed in sending Hugo his advent calendar to review. He did not actually receive it until the 16th of December. My request to him was that he still filmed himself opening it whilst staging that it was different days to try and keep the review as holistic as possible. We wouldn\u2019t want the company knowing the first of his 16 days were all done in the space of 6 hours right? \n\nHugo was distressed by this thought, he was completely unreasonable and making such a scene saying he did not have time to film all of this. I advised him he\u2019d made a commitment to this and couldn\u2019t back out just because it got hard.
