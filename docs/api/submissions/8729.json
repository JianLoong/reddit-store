Nothing came up, he has just shown a habit of not caring and not showing your plans are important to him. Some people are like that but it isn\u2019t complimentary to people like us that are on time. It is frustrating because you can\u2019t count on anything he says. That feeling of plans meaning nothing sucks. Don\u2019t make plans if you can\u2019t do them. Sounds like he isn\u2019t self aware or doesn\u2019t care.  That\u2019s fine, everyone is different, but my tolerance level for that is just really low.

How much effort would he put into getting you interested in him again?\n\nHe doesn't make an effort because he doesn't have to. Is this the relationship you want? Because it sounds like it's all you're going to get from him.", "NTA. If he can\u2019t value your time, why should you value his. You gave him ample warning that you had a definite timetable for leaving. He didn\u2019t respect it, or you. \n\nIt feels like he is doing the bare minimum to maintain a relationship with you.", "NTA.  Do you really want to continue with this? He has no consideration for your time, and his cleanliness is not going to change.  If you go forward with this relationship, be prepared to be the one doing everything.", "NTA. This is a one sided relationship. Dump him.", "Nta, this is a bad relationship. He is not dependable and clearly doesn't prioritize your time together. Move on from him", "NTA. He doesn't sound very interested in you or spending time with you. SOunds like he's trying to get you to break up with him actually.", "Nta. You should not feel bad, he didn't even care about the hike. Is it possible he is depressed? He seems apathetic, he is even living in a mess", "Based off what you\u2019ve said it could be one of two thing in my opinion either he doesn\u2019t care as much like others say or he might have adhd and not know that he does. I didn\u2019t know that I had it till last year and I\u2019m 29. I had so many issues with timing and motivation to do thing even though in my head I\u2019m screaming get up and do it I couldn\u2019t. And then I would get random bursts of energy and motivation and would clean or rearrange my room. It also had me kinda isolated without realizing it because I wouldn\u2019t want to leave the house sometimes and would back out of plans. So before writing him off completely ask him to get evaluated or At least look into it himself because I would do that like my mom would be wanting me to as a teen to clean and do chores and I would say I\u2019ll do it when I get home from school and then by the time I got home it just wasn\u2019t done and I couldn\u2019t explain why just that I kinda forgot which I did but I didn\u2019t know it was a thing with adhd at the time. I always felt like I was stupid and lazy because I couldn\u2019t do things like normal people. Maybe he is the same and he\u2019s just not been diagnosed or he just doesn\u2019t care it\u2019s hard to tell as I do not know him. But from the way you described the pasta night thing that\u2019s what made me think maybe he has adhd. \nNow I want to say this is all just based off the couple paragraphs you\u2019ve written I do not know him personally or if I am correct I am not a doctor in any capacity so please take this with a grain of salt. I could be very wrong and maybe he\u2019s just a lazy ass there are a lot of those in the world", "Is it possible that he is struggling with some mental health issues you may not know about? Maybe he does mean to do the things he says and acts excited about but doesn\u2019t find himself up for it when the time comes so he makes excuses or just doesn\u2019t get up. He might not even be aware what he\u2019s doing. Either way you deserve better than that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If so, there are medications, apps and life coaches that can help him. He has to want to get the help and do the work, that's on him. He may be depressed, he may be disorganized and lazy. He may also have a neurological basis for his behavior. If you want to, you can have a sit down with him to discuss how you feel when he behaves in this way. Use I statements \" when you don't set alarms to get up in time to go on a hike that you agreed to, I feel that I am not a priority\". Ask if he has ever been evaluated for ADHD. There are online symptom quizzes that can help him determine if he has an executive function disorder. ( Some kids your age never got evaluated because their parents didn't want them labelled/ didn't want them medicated). If he does, he can choose to do the work to overcome this, and you then can decide if you want to give him some time and support to work on this. You don't have to, there is no requirement for you to participate in him working on himself, but this may give you a different perspective and a reason to be willing to give him a chance to change.

I definitely think this might be a mental issue", "You're not a hole, you can't cause or cure anybody's depression. He needs professional help", "Ya it\u2019s a very complicated and not very fun mental disorder and a lot of people treat it as like everyone has a bit of it or whatever but that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s hard to explain to people that like in my head I\u2019m beating myself up over not doing my chores and getting extremely depressed because of it. It\u2019s like your frozen physically in your spot but your not. Then it doesn\u2019t help that with adhd come emotion regulation issues. So when you added that he has been depressed in the past that made me think maybe he does have it because a lot of people with adhd have sand anxiety as well because we can become overwhelmed and overstimulated and sometimes  understimulated. A lot of people think it means that your always hyperactive when that\u2019s not really the case and they tend to think that\u2019s like one of the only symptoms but in reality yes most men show outward signs while most women show more internal symptoms like quietness and things like that but women are seen as people who should be more quiet and dainty. But just like with everything else men can have more internal symptoms and less outward ones. \nOne of the issues I have is my brain goes like a million miles a min and so sometimes I\u2019m already onto like the next topic in my head but the conversation hasn\u2019t gotten there yet and then I start talking where my Brian is and the other person is like wait how did you get there and then I\u2019m like oh sorry and then explain myself. I also tend to over explain things cause I feel like I have to for some reason. I also can interrupt people and it\u2019s never on purpose or to be rude it\u2019s because I usually need to say something before I completely forget it and half the time I don\u2019t even notice I\u2019m doing it. \nThe reason I gave these examples is because if he does anything similar then maybe he really does have it and should get checked out and if he doesn\u2019t that\u2019s doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he doesn\u2019t have it just maybe he has a different form or he\u2019s learned to mask his symptoms and everything in a different way then I did growing up. Either way I don\u2019t think you were an asshole but I do think before dumping him find this out because for me personally now that I\u2019m on meds (still learning which ones work for me) I\u2019m better than I was so he can change as well. Also again I could be very wrong as well and maybe he is just not as invested in the relationship as you are or just an ass or whatever else people are commenting on here saying he is", "You are NTA in any way. You are not asking for too much from him.   Another thing!! If you two talk and he does end up sharing some details about his mental health that maybe explain why he acts how he does, do not feel like you have to stay in a relationship you are not happy in due to guilt. It can be tricky in a situation where one person is struggling and taking the other person along with them but always do pay attention to your feelings and don\u2019t hurt yourself just to save them.", "Ahhh makes sense. I don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been with them but I think that when you\u2019re in a relationship with someone mental health becomes something that effects not only them but you as well so it kind of does become your business, at least to some extent. You should feel comfortable enough to talk about these things with your boyfriend. If you ask him about it and he doesn\u2019t take it well that is probably a clear sign that person is not meant for you or willing to fully commit themselves to being with you. Communication is essential", "My hike was pretty good! And your comment is making me think hard because I do feel the anxiety that comes with emotional abuse.", "Maybe that's all it is. Something to stroke his ego", "And you still had to call to wake him up. \ud83e\udd10", "Well the guy is a trucker so he can get up early just chose not to", "Ok no more chance!", "Thanks for sharing your story, I really will just focus on myself now and if he's not interested it won't matter", "Nobody is saying she can cure his depression.
