I'm ready and I'll go at 11am as planned.\"  I had been running around doing some chores and packing for the hike to make  sure I'd be ready on time, and it hurt me that he didn't care as much.\nHe just replied \"oh ok\"\n\nI just got back from the hike and now I feel like the AH for not giving him a chance to get ready.", "created_utc": 1675117212, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pfy4i/aita_if_i_didnt_reschedule_an_activity_i_had/", "score": 410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing came up, he has just shown a habit of not caring and not showing your plans are important to him. Some people are like that but it isn\u2019t complimentary to people like us that are on time. It is frustrating because you can\u2019t count on anything he says. That feeling of plans meaning nothing sucks. Don\u2019t make plans if you can\u2019t do them. Sounds like he isn\u2019t self aware or doesn\u2019t care.  That\u2019s fine, everyone is different, but my tolerance level for that is just really low.

You gave him ample warning that you had a definite timetable for leaving. He didn\u2019t respect it, or you. \n\nIt feels like he is doing the bare minimum to maintain a relationship with you.", "NTA.  Do you really want to continue with this? He has no consideration for your time, and his cleanliness is not going to change.  If you go forward with this relationship, be prepared to be the one doing everything.", "NTA. This is a one sided relationship. Dump him.", "Nta, this is a bad relationship. He is not dependable and clearly doesn't prioritize your time together. Move on from him", "NTA. He doesn't sound very interested in you or spending time with you. SOunds like he's trying to get you to break up with him actually.", "Nta. You should not feel bad, he didn't even care about the hike. Is it possible he is depressed? He seems apathetic, he is even living in a mess", "Based off what you\u2019ve said it could be one of two thing in my opinion either he doesn\u2019t care as much like others say or he might have adhd and not know that he does. I didn\u2019t know that I had it till last year and I\u2019m 29. I had so many issues with timing and motivation to do thing even though in my head I\u2019m screaming get up and do it I couldn\u2019t. And then I would get random bursts of energy and motivation and would clean or rearrange my room. It also had me kinda isolated without realizing it because I wouldn\u2019t want to leave the house sometimes and would back out of plans. So before writing him off completely ask him to get evaluated or At least look into it himself because I would do that like my mom would be wanting me to as a teen to clean and do chores and I would say I\u2019ll do it when I get home from school and then by the time I got home it just wasn\u2019t done and I couldn\u2019t explain why just that I kinda forgot which I did but I didn\u2019t know it was a thing with adhd at the time. I always felt like I was stupid and lazy because I couldn\u2019t do things like normal people. Maybe he is the same and he\u2019s just not been diagnosed or he just doesn\u2019t care it\u2019s hard to tell as I do not know him. But from the way you described the pasta night thing that\u2019s what made me think maybe he has adhd. \nNow I want to say this is all just based off the couple paragraphs you\u2019ve written I do not know him personally or if I am correct I am not a doctor in any capacity so please take this with a grain of salt. I could be very wrong and maybe he\u2019s just a lazy ass there are a lot of those in the world", "Is it possible that he is struggling with some mental health issues you may not know about? Maybe he does mean to do the things he says and acts excited about but doesn\u2019t find himself up for it when the time comes so he makes excuses or just doesn\u2019t get up. He might not even be aware what he\u2019s doing. Either way you deserve better than that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If so, there are medications, apps and life coaches that can help him. He has to want to get the help and do the work, that's on him. He may be depressed, he may be disorganized and lazy. He may also have a neurological basis for his behavior. If you want to, you can have a sit down with him to discuss how you feel when he behaves in this way. Use I statements \" when you don't set alarms to get up in time to go on a hike that you agreed to, I feel that I am not a priority\". Ask if he has ever been evaluated for ADHD. There are online symptom quizzes that can help him determine if he has an executive function disorder. ( Some kids your age never got evaluated because their parents didn't want them labelled/ didn't want them medicated). If he does, he can choose to do the work to overcome this, and you then can decide if you want to give him some time and support to work on this. You don't have to, there is no requirement for you to participate in him working on himself, but this may give you a different perspective and a reason to be willing to give him a chance to change.

I definitely think this might be a mental issue", "You're not a hole, you can't cause or cure anybody's depression. He needs professional help", "Ya it\u2019s a very complicated and not very fun mental disorder and a lot of people treat it as like everyone has a bit of it or whatever but that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s hard to explain to people that like in my head I\u2019m beating myself up over not doing my chores and getting extremely depressed because of it. It\u2019s like your frozen physically in your spot but your not. Then it doesn\u2019t help that with adhd come emotion regulation issues. So when you added that he has been depressed in the past that made me think maybe he does have it because a lot of people with adhd have sand anxiety as well because we can become overwhelmed and overstimulated and sometimes  understimulated. A lot of people think it means that your always hyperactive when that\u2019s not really the case and they tend to think that\u2019s like one of the only symptoms but in reality yes most men show outward signs while most women show more internal symptoms like quietness and things like that but women are seen as people who should be more quiet and dainty. But just like with everything else men can have more internal symptoms and less outward ones. \nOne of the issues I have is my brain goes like a million miles a min and so sometimes I\u2019m already onto like the next topic in my head but the conversation hasn\u2019t gotten there yet and then I start talking where my Brian is and the other person is like wait how did you get there and then I\u2019m like oh sorry and then explain myself. I also tend to over explain things cause I feel like I have to for some reason. I also can interrupt people and it\u2019s never on purpose or to be rude it\u2019s because I usually need to say something before I completely forget it and half the time I don\u2019t even notice I\u2019m doing it. \nThe reason I gave these examples is because if he does anything similar then maybe he really does have it and should get checked out and if he doesn\u2019t that\u2019s doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he doesn\u2019t have it just maybe he has a different form or he\u2019s learned to mask his symptoms and everything in a different way then I did growing up. Either way I don\u2019t think you were an asshole but I do think before dumping him find this out because for me personally now that I\u2019m on meds (still learning which ones work for me) I\u2019m better than I was so he can change as well. Also again I could be very wrong as well and maybe he is just not as invested in the relationship as you are or just an ass or whatever else people are commenting on here saying he is", "You are NTA in any way. You are not asking for too much from him.   Another thing!! If you two talk and he does end up sharing some details about his mental health that maybe explain why he acts how he does, do not feel like you have to stay in a relationship you are not happy in due to guilt. It can be tricky in a situation where one person is struggling and taking the other person along with them but always do pay attention to your feelings and don\u2019t hurt yourself just to save them.", "Ahhh makes sense. I don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been with them but I think that when you\u2019re in a relationship with someone mental health becomes something that effects not only them but you as well so it kind of does become your business, at least to some extent. You should feel comfortable enough to talk about these things with your boyfriend. If you ask him about it and he doesn\u2019t take it well that is probably a clear sign that person is not meant for you or willing to fully commit themselves to being with you. Communication is essential", "My hike was pretty good! And your comment is making me think hard because I do feel the anxiety that comes with emotional abuse.", "Maybe that's all it is.

Stuff happens, now and again, and that's ok, but it sounds like he's got a consistent pattern of letting you down, and if that's not ok, fundamentally, for you, that's ok too. Better to figure that out early on.", "NAH but just because there might be a chance he has a very bad case of undiagnosed ADHD. That comes with terrible time awareness, forgetfulness unless you're drowning in alarms and a high tendency to procrastinate because of the aforementioned issues. Not to mention the squirrel brain where you get distracted easy and fail to realize you're failing at the goals you set yourself to. \n\nThe fact he enjoys spending time together but it's consistently bad at keeping engagements makes it a realistic possibility. He isn't angry or making excuses, he just... goes with the flow. \n\nIf you want to give the relationship a shot, get him to a neuropsychologist to verify if he indeed has it and what tools and mechanisms he can adopt to curb the issues it causes. That said, you're not obligated to give him that shot and not everyone can handle working around that sort of executive deficiency and it's not a bad thing. It's just incompatible lifestyles.", "I was in a relationship like this. I was way forgiving of the behavior because he worked nights (and 12 hour shifts) but even on his nights off he would just sleep or break plans to stay home and play video games. I eventually sat down with him and said, \u201cYou say you love me but your actions say otherwise. If this relationship is going to continue, your actions need to match your words. I need to feel that you love me because right now I don\u2019t. I feel that I\u2019m only your girlfriend when it\u2019s convenient for you and that\u2019s not fair to me and you know it.\u201d", "Agree with this.  Keep on hiking away from him.  He has shown you how little he cares.", "He is just selfish. He may have ADHD but if he isn\u2019t trying to get better this relationship should have. Every time he says you two are going to do something together he is lying. Why would you want to be with someone like that.", "https://www.thestranger.com/savage-love/2018/02/20/25837088/savage-love-letter-of-the-day-dtmfa-dtmfa-dtmfa", "Nah this isn't adhd. Adhd is \"shit shit right we are HIKING let me get out the door as fast as I can I'm coming I swear\". It's often associated with being 5-15min late, not hours late. I've definitely had to answer the door in a robe and plead for 5min to get dressed, but not like this.\n\nThere is also a lot of panic associated with it. We KNOW we're fuckign up and we hate it. This dude just doesn't care.", "ADHD is like the worst named disease ever. \n\nCrippling executive deficiency disorder that makes you get paralyzed because you don't have the impulse to do things while wanting to do all the things at once. I know. Let's call it the can't stand still disorder... \n\nIt's exactly as you described. You keep telling yourself \"I have to do this\" but you don't. Because you tell yourself just one more tiktok, one more post, one more episode. And then the entire day is just... gone and you did fuck all and you feel a huge amount of self loathing. And the depression because you're letting people around you down because you just can't do normal expected things. And then there is the overclocked brain where slow things are uninteresting (I saw a tiktok saying how wonderful it would be if we could put people on 1.5x speed and I related so damn hard), which is specially bad when having conversations because you try to guess what people are saying and talk over them because you are either trying to get to the point or engaged in the topic and overexcited and of course that's super rude and obnoxious behavior. So then you start to try to not talk but you physically can't stop yourself from doing it again because it's like a pressure in your brain.\n\nAnd then all the halfway done projects. Because you get up to grab water, then stop to put a dish in the dishwasher, realize you didn't empty it, so you empty it but then forget you were gonna put the dirty dish in so it stays on the counter. Then you go to the bathroom and return to the bedroom only to remember you forgot the bottle of water you were going to pick up in the first place. And this happens constantly. In everything.", "While I doubt it\u2019s intentional abuse, he\u2019s still saying you\u2019re not important. He just may not be emotionally mature enough yet for a relationship!", "Exactly I think the should change the name of it cause it doesn\u2019t really describe it correctly. I can\u2019t remember the name but a tik tok person made a video about this and said we should call it Dave and it stood for something but I can\u2019t remember the words it stood for. And I think that\u2019s funny cause then I can just say dammit Dave struck again when adhd things happen. I think it would be funny.", "Of course I had to Google it because ya know how it goes. So it stands for Dopamine Attention Variability Executive-Dysfunction. Which is... very very accurate. \n\nI dig it. Specially with the whole damnit Dave thing lol. Thank you for this!", "I think, unfortunately, at this point you know what\u2019s best for you. Good luck and know you deserve the best!", "Ya it\u2019s awesome and I feel like really describes it better than adhd", "Really? Really. No red flags in your line of sight...", "Is he at all upset that you went on the hike without him? If not, there is no reason for you to feel like the AH for not giving him a chance to get ready. It sounds like he didn't care at all. NTA. Let it go, and maybe let him go, too.", "You feel like an AH... When you should be feeling around for a new boyfriend. This one is defective. Unless you consider inability to keep his word a desirable trait in a man.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t sound upset about it. Why are you thinking you\u2019re an asshole here? He blows off your plans all the time. \n\nBut - either talk to him that he\u2019s hurt your feelings and you\u2019d appreciate if you had a real date or if you made plans if he\u2019d stick to them and follow through or whatever and then give him a chance to win at it. OR break up. It\u2019s your choice, but you\u2019re not teaching anyone a lesson by hiking alone though you are doing what you should be doing which is prioritizing your own time and energy.", "NTA. Based just on what you said about these two events, he is an inconsiderate child AH. He has no respect for you or your time or interests and is only concerned with himself. \n\nIt will not get better and you will honestly be better off single than dealing with him. Repeated disappointment and his failure to make the slightest effort for you. Even with binge watching whatever, he couldn't figure out to boil water for pasta between shows? Or use the pause button for two minutes? And set his alarm to get up to go hiking with you instead of you waking him up with your text?", "NTA. Your bf sounds like a loser. You should just break up with him.", "NTA, but jeez, dump the guy. You know why.", "NTA\n\nHe sucks. If he can't make a 11 o clock hiking trip with his GIRLFRIEND, he's not going to get better.", "NTA \n\nPlease keep doing things you plan on time!\n\nIf he can\u2019t be on time. Then just ditch him!", "NTA. Three strikes your out. You have given this guy way too many swings. Time to call it what is. Your out! \nNow, wipe yourself off. Go back out there and hit the big one kid.", "Psycho here! I even love just walking the dog at 6am on sundays- before all the hikers are around.", "I don't even know you, but I know you deserve better.  He's lazy and selfish, and doesn't feel like this relationship is worth any effort.  Make your needs known and find someone who cares.", "Girl, listen to them and leave. \n\nMy ex would constantly do this bs and one time I had called off one day WEEKS in advance so we could watch a movie on release date and I had prepaid for snacks AND tickets\n\nAnd the day of? 30 minutes before we leave? He says he forgot a basketball game was on and he wanted to watch that instead \ud83d\ude44 (it was in January so idk if that was important) \n\nAnd there have been times where I planned for things where he\u2019d respond w \u2018yeah if you want\u2019 and then he\u2019d just not follow thru either\n\nThe way your \u2018boyfriend\u2019 is responding to these plans is depressing, get yourself someone who responds w enthusiasm! \u2018Okay bet! I got the pasta boiling so it\u2019s fresh when you get here!\u2026 you want to get lunch after the hike? I got a disposable camera to take pics w too!\u2019 \n\nIt\u2019s not that hard and you deserve the best", "The second you start feeling that way is the second you end it. You deserve so much better. We all do!", "Lynx River?!", "Does he buy you flowers or snacks or take you out if he messes up? As a way to apologize?\n\nOr talk a lot about doing better? Because that\u2019s just the boy trying to paint himself better cause they think you won\u2019t leave for better", "Oh, sometimes he makes an effort! Why, how very exciting for you. What a sound basis for a FT relationship.", "So, why are you sticking around? Clearly he doesn't want to and doesn't care what you want.", "BUT YOU CANNOT SAVE HIM. Don't waste one more hour of your wild and precious life on him.", "This.. NTA OP... and read this again hun!!!\n\nListen, I allowed the bar to get so low that now starting out in a new and healthy relationship I cry over the most basic kindness from my new man. When he first moved in with me, I was upset and cried over something silly, wasn't something he did either, but I used to get yelled at for crying and being \"too sensitive\" so my reaction was fear. You know what my man did? He wrapped me in a hug, let me know its OK, he is here and I'm safe. That my feelings were valid and it's OK to cry. \n\nPart of me is so angry I allowed myself to be so \"conditioned,\" then I remember.. this is how it happens. It's slow, we don't see the red flags. That 10% seem so big after so much bad... don't let yourself get there OP.. look hard at the situation.  Make sure your ok now, and set boundaries.  Put yourself and your mental, emotional and physical wellbeing FIRST. ITS OK AND YOU'RE WORTH IT!!\u2661", "Even if that's the case, ask yourself if you are willing to sign up for this shit. Being with someone with mental issues is a fucking nightmare when you don't have any. They have to be a hell of a lot worth it to put up with the downsides. Like he has to fucking worship the ground you walk on. Is he? No, he can't even bother to keep a stupid pasta promise to you. Dump. His. Ass. Depression or not. You only have one life, don't.waste any of it on some asshole just because he is 'depressed'.", "NTA. You gave him a chance to get ready. That's why you gave him a timeframe. It's on him to be prepared by 11 am. And he wasn't.", "NTA. He doesn't care. He got used to you being a pushover and not holding him accountable.\n\nI doubt you're gonna change over night and learn to expect respect in your relationship, so dump him and go for men who won't be disrespectful in the first place and work on your boundary setting meanwhile.", "INFO\n\nDoes he have ADHD?", "NTA \n\nHow long will you keep letting him take you for granted? Because he doesn't give a shit about you. His actions plainly show it", "NTA\n\nConsistency is key and this man is not it. Promising things and then backing out last minute is not someone that cares enough. I'm sorry but you're not a priority of his and this is going to keep happening. Ask yourself if this is worth all the effort you make. Because it wouldn't be for me.", "YTA ESH", "Right? I'm genuinely curious how someone like this even makes it from dating to the boyfriend stage.", "Being a lazy selfish asshole does not necessarily mean he has depression \ud83d\ude44", "He invites you for dinner, so you arrive hungry and he decides he\u2019s just going to watch TV instead of cooking you some food? Sounds like he doesn\u2019t care at all", "I spent 5 years with someone I constantly tried to get to go hiking with me, he always had excuses and I kept telling myself he\u2019d change. The few times we did go he was such a miserable pouty brat.  I finally had a wake up call one day (thank you Zoloft!) and left him. I  found someone that likes to hike and do all the same outdoorsy shit I do. Trust me, don\u2019t waste time with people who don\u2019t wanna hike with you!", "It\u2019s so easy to binge watch a show and clean and/or cook at the same time. He\u2019s just a lazy ass", "just imagine how many dope hikes and amazing meals you\u2019ll get to experience on your own. that energy will attract the people on your level and i stg being on your own is so awesome. NTA even a little. seriously who cares if he was happy with your visit? were YOU? that is what matters. find ur happiness all of reddit is rooting for you!", "Don't just break up with him because a stranger told you to. Think about your wider relationship, think about him, (Is this a recent change in behaviour? Could anything else be going on with him?), think about what you want & talk to him - then decide.", "Hon, when the response is unpredictable, human nature is to keep trying in hopes of getting the result you want. Look at gamblers in casinos: wins are unpredictable, so they keep putting down more money. Don't gamble with yourself; let this AH go and find someone who won't play games with you, but will prioritize you the way you will him.", "adhd goes hand in hand with anxiety disorders. this man doesnt give a single shit whether he will be on time for plans and people with adhd stress the whole morning to get ready and usually are 5 to 15 min late in the end while even maybe getting up early because they do NOT want to be late.\ni dont know what this man has and blaming a neurological disorder is an easy way out obviously, but not caring about a relationship isn't the same as adhd.", "have adhd, can confirm. we are always so sorry.", "This. This this this."]}
