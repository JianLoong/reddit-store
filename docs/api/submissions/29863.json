My MIL is PISSED saying \"How dare you assume they can't afford this child! How stupid do you think they are!?\" I tell her, I'm sorry, but when people plan to have a second (third???) Child together, typically they make sure they can afford it.

Win win! You get some money for Christmas gifts and they get items for their baby. You aren\u2019t obligated to fund their child. NTA", "NTA- you are struggling. It is none of her business what you do with your extras. Tell her since she is seeing that the couple is struggling you would be happy to let them know that MIL is planning on getting them the items they need by taking them shopping. And if they aren't struggling tell her to butt out. She has no say in what you do. Can your SO get his mom in check?", "Nta it's your stuff, do what you want", "NTA. She can purchase it if she wants. You're trying to make some extra money, not run a charity.", "NTA \n\nYou are struggling and in need of things for your child as well (even if they are Christmas and/or birthday gifts).  \n\nIt sucks if they are also struggling but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to just hand them all of your baby\u2019s things when you are trying to sell\nThem to buy her current needs.", "NTA. Your stuff, you can do whatever you want with it. Tell MIL to stay in her lane.", "NTA Next time you can mark \u201chide from friends\u201d when you list on marketplace to avoid any awkwardness.", "NTA\n\nIf you aren\u2019t close enough to know if this is the first, second or possibly third child, you aren\u2019t close enough to HAVE to give her stuff", "MIL wants to get brownie points from the relatives for arranging these \"gifts\".", "Your mother in law is an asshole. I\u2019m sorry you are related to her \ud83e\udd72", "NTA. They belong to you, you get to decide what you are doing with them.", "Mil needs to get her nose out of your business. End of story", "People with few years gap between the kids, or accidental pregnancies often don't have any leftovers from the first child, just to clear up you sound very condescending somehow. \n\nThat being said you are NTA to decide what you are going to do with your own stuff; if you do need money it is absolutely logical to sell stuff you don't need. \n\nNow what made me laugh is our mother reacted in the absolute opposite way to yours. We decided to hand over any small clothes and other items to our friend who had a baby about 1yr after us, and the mother was absolutely furious yelling why we did not sell the stuff instead since we struggled a bit financially with one-income momentarily - nothing existential to be clear, but sure we had to make some cuts in our usual budget.  Point is, you can do with your own stuff whatever you choose to do. And you can't please everyone.", "Eh, you are selling stuff for extra money for Xmas and judging someone else on having a third child you have no idea if they \"can afford\" or not. It seems a bit pot/ kettle. As you can see, sometimes things just don't go how we expect them financially. Best laid plans and all. \n\nIn my fam, giving things to friends/relatives is just what we do because it's family/friends and a kind thing do to. Whether or not they are in need or no, we offer. I could see MIL taking it as a slight in the sense that you are rejecting helping family, regardless of said family's need for the things or your ability to give things away vs sell.  I also recognize that might not be the reason she's upset about it. \n\nNTA for wanting/needing to earn money for your things, though, especially if you need it.", "NTA, but you're wrong for generalizing to \"people having a second child don't need anything.\"  Depending on the age gap between kids, they may have already donated all their original gear.", "NTA. MIL is out of line and needs to mind her own business.", "NTA it\u2019s your stuff and you can do with it as you please. But keep in mind you\u2019re a little na\u00efve regarding having more kids down the line. \ud83d\ude06 let us know how that works out for you.", "NTA, on your stuff your decision.  Since mom wants the family to have the bundle, let her buy it from you.\n\nBut YTA on your reasoning about second/third child. You're judging them unfairly without knowing facts. \n\nIt doesn't matter if it's a second or third child if the closest child in age to the new baby is 5+ years older.   A second or third child could be an \"oops.\" My brothers were 14 and 12 when I came along, obviously unplanned by my 40 YO mother. It happens.", "I don't understand why you feel so superior considering you are selling gifts for cash. Tbh if I gave you gifts I would expect you to gift it if you didn't end up using it not sell for profit. I would never give you a gift again.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re talking shit about them not affording their kid and they shouldn\u2019t get anything for a third child. They didn\u2019t ask you for anything. You have no stated reason to think they even know that your MIL asked for the stuff. You\u2019re attacking people who didn\u2019t put themselves in the situation. \n\nMIL can get over herself.
