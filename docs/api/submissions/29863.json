So, AITA?\n\nEdit; OK, I'm getting mixed responses here saying I'm TA about my attitude towards having second children. In my opinion, if you can't afford kids, you should not have them. So many women/families can/are living off of welfare with 6+ kids being neglected. Also *huge disclaimer* I'm not just giving away gifts from the baby shower.

If you can't afford to get things your kid will need and afford an occasional 'luxury', like a toy or a nice outfit or something so your kid isn't just living off the bare-bones basics - you probably shouldn't have kids. I live in a low-income area, I see people with six or more kids who can't afford to take care of  a single one all the time, they get more assistance for the more kids they have and just blow it on booze or up their nose and brag about how much money they get for groceries and selling their food stamp card for makeup and tattoos and shit, while their kids are running in the street, causing property damage and not going to school.  \n\n\nI've even been told before, when asking if there's any way for me to get more food assistance (I'm disabled, and while I've been job searching for ages I haven't heard back from ANYONE I've applied to) that I should have a baby so I get more assistance. I'm just like...no?? I don't want kids, I'm not in a financial position to have kids and getting like, twenty more dollars a month wouldn't be anywhere near enough to comfortably raise a child and give them the opportunities they deserve?!

Welfare wasn\u2019t meant to be a lifelong grift or a generational practice, which it has become. If  some of the money spent on these welfare cases were put toward other uses, this country would be in a better spot. Honestly, I\u2019d rather care for the needy elderly, the truly disabled, and veterans over people who are lazy and see all forMs of welfare programs as something they\u2019re \u201centitled\u201c to rather than working to provide for themselves.\n\nlastly, if is this couple\u2019s second kid, was the first also a girl?

I have never seen so many distraught people over having a baby shower for the second or third or fourth child until Reddit. There are so many things that get over used by 1 child that you have to throw them out. Oneies and diapers are not always cheap. A baby shower is about celebrating a new life. You give what the child or mother may need. Weather its diapers or the neatest recovering mommy thing. Which by the way for the second 3rd and 4th child are great. You give at a baby shower because parents need a break not because of financial needs. But hey that helps so much. But having that new diaper size when needed saves so much stress too.

I won't bother with that part of the situation. \n\nMIL feels entitled to donate your possessions regardless of your decisions. If she really wants to gift this bundle to the family, then she can buy it and donate it. Tell her that granddaughter will be so happy with the new birthday/Christmas gifts you will be able to afford because of MIL's generosity to that family. \n\nWant to bet she wants to donate your money, not hers? I think its so nice how generous people are with other people's time/possessions. NTA", "ESH\n\nIt\u2019s your stuff so you can sell it. That\u2019s the bottom line. BUT it is interesting that you are so adamant that you are right about judging people for having children that they can\u2019t afford when you literally can\u2019t afford to give a kid Christmas unless you sell some of your stuff. The only point being that financial hardship happens, and most of the time it\u2019s unexpected so you were stand on the financial ability to care for a second kid or a third kid is nonsensical to me. People plan pregnancies and still encounter situations like yours where you have a medical issue that causes financial instability. Also, plenty of people have kids unintentionally for whatever reason. \nAs far as your MIL, it\u2019s really none of her business. The fact that she is making such an issue out of it, kind of paints her as a very stereotypical clich\u00e9 MIL. Sorry you have to endure a lifetime of that petty meddling drama. \n\nIf nothing else, I would say that you are bucking societal norms with your decision. A lot of people do hand me down, especially with things that were gifted to them. Most people regift things that they don\u2019t want or use, especially in situations regarding babies. That\u2019s pretty normal. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s their first kid or their kid, most people give away, hand me downs, and excess children\u2019s stuff instead of trying to cash in on it. You said you expect to get $70 for what you\u2019re selling and that you want to use that money for Christmas presents for your kid. It\u2019s not gonna get you very far right now.

One of my friends got pregnant while reliably taking her pill, was only when she was second trimester that she realised it was a fetus not stomach troubles (It worked out well for her, and she's happy but it was deffo a surprise and she was luckily in a position that she could deal with a surprise pregnancy)", "Ohhhhhhh, so good jewelry, gold jewelry, designer clothes okay to do that so you can exchange what doesn\u2019t work/fit so you can get same thing. But baby items, no, cuz to help family, not like traditional gift. Do I have it all right now?", "Thing is I do not even know these people. I have never met them. Don't even know the baby's gender, that is, until she gave birth like 4 days ago!", "No, it's not.", "Yes. I have never met them. I'm going offer everything boyfriend tells me about them.", "Sorry I offended you. I did not want to.\nI just tried to explain, what I think is the common feeling on this bc you were asking.", "Ok so in some families it's completely normal to send gifts to new babies regardless of how many the family have had or how close you are. MIL seems to have expected that from you and your partner.\n\nYou clearly don't gift give like that, also perfectly normal and within your right to say 'oh i don't know them/can't afford gifts right now' or let your partner handle it since it's his family. \n\nWhat is honestly fucking weird is you suddenly jumping to whether this family that you do not know can or can't afford this kid. Imagine if your MIL had said \"oh it's uncle gregs birthday, you should send him that thing you're selling\" and instead of saying \"i don't know uncle greg\" you said \"isn't uncle greg like 45? Why does he need birthday presents, can't he afford his own stuff?\" No wonder your MIL got annoyed, it's a really weird response to being asked to give a gift to a family member. \n\nYou're \"people should only have children if they can definitely afford them (but it's totally ok that i only got by because of baby shower gifts because my circumstances changed but i refuse to acknowledge that could happen to others)\" screed seems totally irrelevant. You seem to have made it about finances when no one else did.", "Your MIL needs to stfu and stop being so rude. Is she always that entitled? You can block friends from your fb marketplace, block her", "Your bf thinks they are on welfare?", "Ohhh gosh, no, I\u2019m not offended. Sorry you got that impression. I\u2019m just trying to understand what to do with gift (like gold jewelry or designer jacket, or shoes for that matter) how to exchange it for what will work (like sell it to someone, add money to make up loss, meaning difference in price, in order to go to store to get same thing in right size, color, etc). Know that\u2019s okay. Didn\u2019t realize baby items aren\u2019t okay and it\u2019s different. I didn\u2019t realize that. I was just so very confused. My apologies if I seemed offended. I wasn\u2019t at all. Just trying to understand. Thank you kindly..,,", "No.", "\u2764\ufe0f im sorry to. You are a good one.\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f", "Then what is your problem?\n\nYou won't give one of your 100 outfits to someone bc they *might* be on welfare? \n\nI mean you obvi aren't required to, it's your stuff, and if they don't know you, they're probably not expecting anything from you \n\nso really it is odd that your MIL wants you to give them something.  She likely reaches to add her name to the card\n\nBut this whole \"people who plan multiple kids shouldn't expect gifts\" is really an odd thing, especially when you throw in \"they're probably losers on welfare\" attitude \n\nAlso your baby shower sounds like you invited 100. Plus people", "OMGOSH you do not have to apologize. Sweet of you though. Same back \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f"]}
