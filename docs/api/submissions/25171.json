I own my home and understand I am fortunate, but I also worked hard for it. Any money I received or earned while working part-time till graduation went into my savings account.\n\nMost people on my street are social housing tenants; I'm still determining what that is, but they've explained that you're eligible for the scheme if you're on a low income. It's more secure than the private sector as you mostly get assured tenancy's even though there are different tenancy types.\n\nFor a while, I got on well with my next-door neighbours \"Emily\" and \"Ben\" they also have three kids (13M, 9F, 4F), but soon I started experiencing a lot of problems from next door. I work from home often, and I could hear shouting next door constantly; Ben is 5\"11, 145kg and quite loud and intimidating, and I could hear their kids screaming and crying. I had to ask them to lower their voices daily, and I even explained that I work from home. \n\nThe next set of problems revolved around the 13-year-old son. I spotted their son climbing over a wall to get into my garden to get his football back which at first I ignored it. Then after it happened ten times, I finally decided to speak with his parents, and I can't remember what I said entirely. Still, it was something like, \"Hey, I just wanted to have a word as I have seen your son, <insert name here>, trespass 11 times to get his ball from my garden. I would appreciate it if you could get him to stop as he is trespassing, and if he just came round to the front and knocked on my front door and asked for his ball back I would happily collect it for him.\" The neighbours apologised and said they would make sure their son doesn't do it and knock. \n\nA few days later, their son did it again while I was in my lounge. I walked into my garden, which made him jump and spoke with him. I told him I'd seen him trespass to collect his ball on various occasions. I told him I had talked with his parents and that trespassing is a crime, and I would appreciate it if he could just come to the front and knock in the future. He didn't say anything and just went back into his garden. I informed his parents, and they apologised, but it continued.\n\nI got fed up with it and decided to invest in CCTV finally. I wrote a letter to residents on my road to give them a week's notice that CCTV is being insulted at my address, and it will cover my entire garden and it will also cover my doorway. I also wrote that I'm getting a ring doorbell camera. After installing CCTV, I thought it would stop the kids from trespassing. It continued. I saved the footage, filed a police report against the son for trespassing, and sent all my evidence to the police. I knew there was a strong chance that nothing was going to happen but I just wanted the son to have some responsibility.\n\nWhen my neighbours found out they were mad AF with me and since then our relationship soured.
