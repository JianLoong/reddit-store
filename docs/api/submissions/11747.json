We always meet 30mins before dinner to allow time for a drink, chat, and look over the menu.\n\nThe organiser said 630pm meet for 7pm dinner, table booked, but this was bad timing for a couple of us so I requested 530pm meet and the other family member mentioned that would be better for her also. We received no response.\n\nThe dinner was in a different town 30 minutes drive away. I have a newborn breast-fed baby, husband is away working, the venue was outdoors, and the weather was cold. I had suggested an earlier time mainly because by 630-7pm the baby is getting grumpy, bathed fed and put to bed.\n\nHowever with no response I still reluctantly packed the baby bag and made the drive as per the organisers time and even arrived 10 minutes early at 6:20pm.\n\nI arrived to find the group (about 15 people) had been at the venue since 5-5.30pm, and had already ordered their food without me before I arrived. Their food started being served about 5 minutes after I got there. They all live close to each other so communicated with themselves and didnt inform the group chat.\n\nI wished mom a happy birthday but was so obviously annoyed I was not informed, and now had to order/eat alone and separate from the group. So annoyed that I did not order any food at all out of spite. The group felt bad and were trying to give me leftover food from their plates, I declined.\n\nOnce they finished eating I kissed my mother goodbye and left angry. Picking up a dominos pizza on the way home and dealing with a grumpy out of sync baby the rest of the night.\n\nNow they are saying I overreacted and was being dramatic.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nINFO: The organiser booked the table for a 630pm meet 7pm dinner.

Did anyone confirm with her?', didn't say boo, and then wondered why she was mad she made the trip with a baby to a dinner that everyone else was already eating pretty much by the time she sat down. \n\nYes, OP could have just ordered late and eaten, but I don't see how anyone would expect her not to be mad.\n\nNTA", "NTA - out of 15 people, no one decided to verify the time change? Even if they assumed you knew and have some grace if they thought you were running late - no one reached out by like 6pm?", "NTA. They were rude.", "NTA can grown ass adults really be so dense? Not only did they leave you on read, no one texted \u201chey you on your way? Can we order something for you?\u201d When they got there at 5/5:30?", "NTA. This is absolutely ridiculous and inconsiderate of them. I\u2019m mad for you.", "NTA. You have a new baby. They fail to communicate in a coherent manner and made the dinner pointless for you.  Stick to your guns.", "NTA. How hard is it to alert you that dinner had officially changed to 5:30? FFS. \n\nPlus the whole \"Take our disgusting picked over food!\" EW. Shut it down. Dealbreaker. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA - If they're communicating about this, they need to make sure everyone is included. That's on them.\n\nYou weren't rude, or obnoxious about it, you have every right to be annoyed.\n\nIf there's a discussion in a group chat, it needs to be finished in a group chat.\n\nDoesn't matter if they felt bad, there was multiple of them, they should have realized", "NTA - on top of the mental load of caring for a new born you still made it on \u2018time\u2019 to a party despite wanting a different time. You wanted to be there for your mother but wanted some consideration if your own circumstances too. It was very inconsiderate of them to not only meet earlier at the time YOU proposed but to not even inform you! I\u2019m sorry for you.", "NTA - The organizer not confirming the new time was 5:30 and everyone showing up early seems like a simple miscommunication honestly, but what makes everyone else TA's here is that not a single one of them thought once to call or text you asking where you were when you didn't show up. It's not as though you were just 5-15 minutes late from the new time either, you were late enough to where any normal person would start to wonder if something's wrong. The fact that no one in your family thought to try and see where you were at sends the message they don't care about your presence there and that hurts, regardless if it was a simple mistake or not. I would probably have acted similarly if I had been in your position and I hope they apologize to you.\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA that is so rude and thoughtless in normal circumstances but to do it to someone who has a young baby is even worse. I think staying as long as you did and leaving quietly was actually very gracious.", "NTA. Event start times are not decided by auction. Someone should have thought to let you know they were accepting your new proposed time. \n\nNot ordering food for yourself wasn't spiteful. The timing didn't work well for you in the first place and since everyone else was about finished eating already, there was even less reason to try to accommodate it. Why spend an extra hour awkwardly eating alone in the cold with a cranky baby to make these people feel better when they couldn't take 30 seconds to confirm the plan with you?", "NTA all anybody had to do was text or call instead they said nothing to you, one of the two people who asked. They don\u2019t respect your time and that was apparent.", "NTA pure ignorance not to let you know they'd changed the time. Trying to organise things with babies is a nightmare, you didn't make demands and still went even though it was a difficult time of the evening, only to find they'd changed to the time that suited you, but just didn't tell you. I'd be irritated and annoyed too.", "I hope you learned to just not go the next time it is a time frame that will f you over by messing up baby's schedule.  Who organizes a bday dinner the day of anyway... Everyone knew her bday was today so this could have been pre-planned weeks ago.\n\nNTA", "NTA. They are inconsiderate jerks. Now they are acting all butt hurt bc you didn't stick around and take their crap.", "NTA Why would they move the time to 500 or 530 and not inform you? And now they're calling you an AH?\nThey're the AHs.", "NTA - they arrived early and ordered their food without you?  You didn't overreact, you under reacted.   And good on you for only being annoyed, my feelings would have been really hurt.", "INFO: When did you ask if 5:30 would be okay? I'm wondering why no one confirmed the time.\n\nThis should really be on the organizer. However, if there was no response I think you'd have been justified in asking?", "NTA-they were though.", "NTA. Though I would have probably texted again when no one replied to you.  Just a quick \u201cso we\u2019re still doing 6:30 then?\u201d But they suck for not telling you", "NTA", "NTA.", "NAH. Imagine how'd you respond if you didn't have to pack up a newborn, in the cold, and drive 30 min away to sit in the cold, with the new born and I'd wager you probably had to do a feeding either right before or right after this journey. And I'm guessing you are going through some sleep deprivation right now. \n\nMy point is, babies ae great love love love but its really really hard on parents, everything is more difficult and you become more triggered, for lack of better word, about anything out of place. Its natural. Give your self some grace. Did you overreact? Maybe but who cares. Feel free to decline any and all social interactions till kiddo is atleast on a steady sleep cycle and you can find normalcy.", "I feel badly for your mom.\n\nETA: Does nobody else think this is sad?! Crazy!  The organizer is inconsiderate to two family members who request a change; nobody tells them when they DO change it; a new mom with tiny LO struggles to get there then leaves in tears\u2026 how could this family think it fair to OP and how in the world could they ruin her mom\u2019s birthday with such immaturity? Just honestly curious about the downvotes because I think it is awful.", "ESH\n\nYou were being dramatic. Why not just leave the moment you got there and realized they'd started dinner an hour early? They clearly didn't care if you were there or not, as nobody bothered to ping you when you were \"late\" (compared to them)? \n\nYou've only played yourself. You wasted your own time, after they wasted your commute, when you could've just left and gone and had a decent dinner on your own instead if sitting around like a hangry brat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Surely your mother doesn't think you overreacted? With a newborn, I probably would have left immediately. You gave them the courteousy of staying a while and wishing your mother happy birthday.", "NTA It\u2019s incredibly rude to schedule a time, change it,  and then tell everybody about one person about the change. None of them called or texted you, not even to say hey we all got here early do you want us to order something for you? What else are you supposed to do, stay out all night when you have a baby at home?", "INFO: so it sounds like the thread ended with two people saying 5:30 would be best, and everyone but you interpreted this as 5:30 was the new time? That\u2019s an unfortunate misunderstanding but YTA for blaming everyone and acting spiteful. Really, anyone could have followed up to confirm the final time including you.", ">The group felt bad\n\nYTA. So this was all miscommunication. Or are you suggesting they purposely did this, **why would that even be?** If you didn't get a response on the group text, why didn't you follow up and ask hey what was decided here?\n\nThis was your Mom's birthday, not some random dinner.", "YTA. You didn't get to order with them. And you made a big deal out of it. You killed the vibe. \n\nI wonder if you envy them because they have so much more freedom in their schedule and you are stuck in the newborn drudgery. Maybe you even have post-partum depression. You might be mourning your old life where you were spontaneous like them.\n\nYou should apologize and join some new mom groups and tell your doctor you are acting dramatic and having tantrums.", "INFO: Why didn't you call them after a while?", "I was wondering this too. She asked for the time change, and was driving there alone with a baby. No one thought to check on her? When she was almost an hour late?", "I asked about 10mins after I saw the message in the group chat. Could the the organiser has seen the message but she did not respond.", "If you read the post, they all communicated with each other outside of the group chat and decided on a new time. They didn't all stop talking after those messages and just show up at 5:30.", "How many times do you think she should ask them?", "What a weird fucking comment. Insinuating she has PPD because she was upset no one told her the dinner time changed? \n\nPlease seek help. This comment is literally unhinged.", "Lmfao no.. she\u2019s NTA.. your comment is unhinged", "Obviously you don\u2019t have kids lol or had to deal with a newborn.", "OP can clarify, but it sounded to me like because they live close, they arranged rides together and thought the time was 5:30, not that they all made secret text threads to somehow exclude OP.", "It sounds like after two people said \u20185:30 would be better for me\u2019 everyone but OP understood the new time to be 5:30. The organizer should have confirmed for sure but it was an honest miscommunication.", "She clearly says in her post that they communicated on the side in their own personal messages and arranged for the new time to be 530 and didn\u2019t include that discussion for agreement in the group text", "But does she mean like, they arranged rides together? Or did they all make a different chat?", "\u201cThey live near each other so communicated with themselves\u201d\n\nMy understanding is that they live close to each other so they commonly directly and individually message each other and that\u2019s how they arranged and confirm the new time without including the entire group chat", "Grumpy.\n\nI think best case scenario if this happened to me would be grumpy.\n\nMost likely, pissed.\n\nNTA.\n\n\"Sure\", thats all anyone needed to post in the group chat.", "I would have been livid. And i would have said something VERY tacky.", "You drove 30 minutes away with a baby...NTA\n\nThe LEAST they could have done was inform you of the time change instead of wasting your time. Especially since EVERYONE has a cellphone on hand to send a quick reply.  \n\nI wouldn't have stayed and I would have made a big fuss that out of 15 guests none of them hand any manners to notify you.", "NTA but I really wouldn\u2019t have stuck around out of spite. I would\u2019ve just gone right the fuck back home and maybe salvaged some of my baby\u2019s time.", "I\u2019d be irritated too. NTA", "NTA. You made the effort, they dropped the ball. Under the circumstances of their rudeness, you have the right to be dramatic if you want to. You went out of your way to be accommodating to the others in the group, and they treated you callously . Then had the nerve to talk about you behind your back after you left. I hope your mom set them straight.", "NTA how fucking rude to do that! I hope the pizza.was good and that you didn't have to choke down food from the assholes who didn't even response or check in with you. What's your mother's deal? If everyone else knew but didn't bother telling you, I'd presume it was on purpose. If that's the case, don't bother making that 30 minute drive again.

And you don\u2019t just eff around with a baby\u2019s schedule or there will be hell to pay.", "NTA", "Not sure how leaving early causes a scene unless you were mouthing?

Maybe YOU should take some time to review reading comprehension?", "NTA. I've been there. Just too angry to even eat. It's not like you blew up on them and called them out for being rude. And NOONE thought to call you after being an HOUR late? That's insane!", "NTA", "You were mor polite than i would have been. \nNTA\nI would have walked in \nHappy birthday mom. Your all assholes. Go to hell.\n\nThen i would have walked out", "Honestly I am a little less annoyed at the group chat now. Not trying to downplay what they did but my family puts everything on group chat so sometimes I get annoyed when my phone keeps going off but that is better then getting left out of the overall conversation. Especially with younger kids.", "NTA.  I would have wished mom a happy birthday when the food arrive and left.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s your moms birthday, my mom would be furious if any of her children were not fully informed of plans for her birthday and excluded, and even slightly. It would ruin her birthday and break her heart.\n\nAlso she would want to be able to spend a birthday dinner with her new grandchild. I can only assume your mom would feel the same, as would most moms.\n\nBeing frustrated makes sense. You\u2019re a new mom and trying to accommodate family and friends for your mothers birthday and find out plans were changed without your knowledge (why was it necessary to finish planning OUTSIDE the group chat?! That makes no sense), not only throwing off your child\u2019s schedule but yours as well.\n\nIt may seem dramatic to some, but as someone with no children but a big family that\u2019s hard to plan things with, you are NTA at all. You had every right to be frustrated.", "ESH (as in OP & Organizer)\n\nThere is no reason why the guests who did not organize it would know OP hadn't been informed.\n\nSo Organizer is the BIG A-H.  But OP threw a tantrum here.  The guests tried to help/appease her and she failed to be appeased.", "[deleted]", "YTA. It's not about you! Not everything runs around your baby's schedule I don't understand why you even included that.", "YTA - you made this about yourself and not about your mother.", "Yeah that\u2019s annoying as f*ck", "Sigh. \n\nYes, grown ass adults CAN be this dense. I\u2019m anticipating right now the arrival of adult family who have barely shared any plans with me about their actual day of arrival beyond the date. \n\nCommunication is challenging, y\u2019all!!", "Ummmmmmmmmmmm", "OP said in the post that they talked and figured it out in person because everyone else lives closer together, and they did not send any messages in the chat about a time change.", "Eh, if after offering a new time as a possibility and noone said anything I would have assumed that the answer was a no and just went according to the old time. They really should have said something after the op didn't show up after thirty minutes.", "Newborn drudgery? Wtf?", "Exactly.  If this happened to a friend, I would be calling to make sure they are okay and didn't get into an accident.", "That was disgusting by the way. Oh? You're hungry? Here's my left overs. you know, eat it like a dog. That's just disgusting. NTA"]}
