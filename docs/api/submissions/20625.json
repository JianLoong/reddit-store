I also have a symptom diary for my health and well-being+I never eat outside  since high school.

The problem is,he lives a really laid back lifestyle. He is still a party animal (I went to a party once or twice in my life and I hate big gatherings and crowded places),he likes to come home tipsy,him and my cousin are always having their friends over and I can't do anything but lock the door because my parents are letting them do that.

It is a very unhealthy outlook to equate inpatient care to insanity. You could learn a lot of skills and coping mechanisms that would greatly improve your anxiety.", "Some inpatient treatment might do you good. It seems that you're a little too stuck in your routines, you need to interact with people, gain some life experience, and then you'll get a better perspective of what is a dangerous situation and what is just a drunk guy sleeping.\n\nIn patient treatment, actually any mental health treatment does not mean someone is insane. Please stop with the nasty stigmatising. It doesn't help anyone.", "If you were genuinely worried about this guy, you\u2019re NTA, even if your reaction was extreme. But, and I say this with all love, it does seem like you\u2019d benefit from something more effective than the therapy you\u2019re currently receiving. The obsessive attitudes you\u2019ve described sound exhausting.", "YTA. Ambulances aren\u2019t to be wasted on drunk people, can you imagine if everyone called for every drunk person? You are projecting your own fears you clearly do need some form of help your anxieties are not normal.", "YTA\n\nDid anyone ask you to call his parents? He's TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. He was drunk and passed out.... It's one thing to call an ambulance (which they should have woken him up and asked if he wanted to go to the hospital) and have them check on him. \n\nYour issues are YOUR issues. You don't call another adult's parents cause they're drunk.", "YTA. Dude was just fuckin' drunk and sleeping it off lol. This sub has some weird Puritanical thinking when it comes to alcohol tho", "NTA for being worried about him, but if I were you I would focus on myself. these obsessions are not good and are affecting not only your mental health but ability to live. please consider new/more therapy", "You were worried about him, you grossly overreacted though. I\u2019m not going to judge AH because this is not the post for that, this is me as a healthcare professional telling you you need psychiatric help. You are bordering obsessive compulsions and body dysmorphia. Being THIS OBSESSED to the point you don\u2019t vacation, you don\u2019t eat out, and when you\u2019re stressed all you do is work out? Seriously listen to your psychiatrist.", "ESH. I get that you were concerned and they don't seem like a good housemate but you over reacted big time.", "YTA and startlingly naive. He was simply drunk and sleeping. You way overreacted. He's 25 years old. Calling his parents? To say what? Their son was asleep on the couch? Get out of here.", "NAH.  You are not insane and some inpatient treatment might do you well for your anxiety and other related issues (maybe OCD?) It's not a big deal, but \\*do not\\* think treatment = insane. There are meds that can ease your suffering, because you are suffering. Also, your relatives need to calm down.", "YTA, dont lie, you did this out of spite.", "YTA", "nta, imagine the regret you would have if he had actually had alcohol poisoning. although i do think you would benefit from extra help based on what you described, not based on the situation", "hate to break it to your cousin, NTA.\n\n\nbetter safe than sorry,, and now you know what being drunk looks like so no need to over react next time.", "NTA and kudos for keeping an eye out for your cousin. Next time just roll him onto his side so he doesn\u2019t choke on his own vomit and you\u2019re good.", "NTA for calling the ambulance and letting his parents know, it's better to be safe than sorry.", "YTA but this probably your way of convincing everyone you don't want a roommate.", "NTA. Unlike all the commenters voting y.ta, I will say you do not have the life experience to tell the difference between a passed out drunk who will wake up with a hangover and a passed out drunk who has alcohol poisoning and will die without medical treatment.  You do have an unusual life style but you\u2019re not hurting anybody. May I suggest you get yourself a good lawyer to be on call if your parents try to exercise inappropriate control over you.", "NTA, you seem to be genuinely concerned for him! although it may have been overly extreme, you did what you thought was right! like everyone said, better to be safe then sorry what if something actually happened ??? your family would then be grateful.. I personally don\u2019t think you should have \u201cinpatient time\u201d, however you could definitely benefit from more support such as counselling and therapy :))", "NTA. He could've ODed, you don't know. You were looking out for him.\n\nYour need for routine and anxiety when it gets interrupted resonates with me. As someone else said, sell the house to get out of the situation and then live alone. I feel your parents are purposely pushing you for no good reason, maybe thinking you'll change to be more 'normal' but it'll just make the anxiety worse.\n\nYour routine isn't self destructive or harmful to others, I think you'll feel much better living alone being able to maintain the routine. Keep going to your therapist as normal to improve your anxiety, but you're not 'at risk' and don't need to be admitted.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou did the right thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and they called my psychiatrist about it. Right now he is also recommending me inpatient time,\" .. STOP LETTING THEM ABUSE YOU. Force a sale of the house - or let your parents buy you out at MARKET VALUE. And live somewhere else. Have a lot less contact with ALL of these AHs, INCLUDING your parents. Or go no contact. YOur life will be much better without these AHs in your life.", "Nta, you can also die of alcohol poisoning, but try not to overstep and project your health scares onto him. Go out more, get distracted, one day your cousin will realize that this Lifestyle has its consequences, but you are not the one who has to control that.", "NTA...if he wasn't responding then calling ambulance is correct. Unless your harming someone or yourself, no need for inpatient psych. \nJust because your routines are positive working out, eating healthy doesn't mean they are not doing bad things.", "YTA, why on earth would you call an ambulance for someone having a drunken sleep in their own house, you're wasting those paramedics time. \n\nCalling his parents was even more unhinged, he's an adult.\n\n\nThe whole op honestly reads as kind of unhinged and like you think you're better than this guy because you make healthy food, get a new therapist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
