The conflict that led to them not speaking to each others for a long time is because they told her ex fiancee about a pre-existing medical condition she had. This ruined the relationship and Jane went low to no contact.\n\nShe met her now husband and their wedding took place 2 weeks ago. The problem was that she did not invite our parents although she reconciled with them but she said it's her wish. Our parents reacted negatively and there was sk much arguing to the point where Jane told them to either drop it or she'd cut them off. This grieved our parents a lot. As well as other relatives but none of them wanted to tell them where the wedding is except me. I did it after my parents cried and said that they didn't wanna miss a once in a life opportunity to see Jane get married. I gave them the address and thought that Jane's heart might soften when she saw them. But instead, she went nuts and there was a blow up at the wedding. Although our parents were nice they were still kicked out of the place.\n\nLater Jane chewed me out for what I did and claimed I ruined her wedding. Her new husband told me to leave which I thought an overreaction because mainly, our parents really cared enough to come and didn't wanna miss the chance.\n\nSince then, Jane hasn't been answering my calls and her new husband keeps saying that I messed up and potentially ruined our relationship.", "created_utc": 1678721976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qd14i/aita_for_giving_my_parents_the_address_of_my/", "score": 210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This ruined the relationship and Jane went low to no contact.\n\nShe met her now husband and their wedding took place 2 weeks ago. The problem was that she did not invite our parents although she reconciled with them but she said it's her wish. Our parents reacted negatively and there was sk much arguing to the point where Jane told them to either drop it or she'd cut them off. This grieved our parents a lot. As well as other relatives but none of them wanted to tell them where the wedding is except me. I did it after my parents cried and said that they didn't wanna miss a once in a life opportunity to see Jane get married. I gave them the address and thought that Jane's heart might soften when she saw them. But instead, she went nuts and there was a blow up at the wedding. Although our parents were nice they were still kicked out of the place.\n\nLater Jane chewed me out for what I did and claimed I ruined her wedding. Her new husband told me to leave which I thought an overreaction because mainly, our parents really cared enough to come and didn't wanna miss the chance.\n\nSince then, Jane hasn't been answering my calls and her new husband keeps saying that I messed up and potentially ruined our relationship.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was a \"deal-breaking\" medical condition she willfully hid from someone she was ENGANGED TO.  If she hadn't told him (whatever it was) by that point, she wasn't going to.  She is an AH for that.\n\nHowever that doesn't give the parents the right to butt in (unless she was, say, HIV positive or something), and OP was wrong to go against her wishes about this.\n\nSo sister sucks too, but for this isolated part of the story, it's a YTA.\n\nWhat I really want to know is - does now-husband know whatever this secret is???", "Agreed, I don't see anyone other than possibly Jane's current and ex as being a non-asshole.", "Considering it's Jane's health, she absolutely has the right to share what she wants with WHO she wants, fiance or otherwise. We don't know what the condition is and it may not be as serious as OP is making it sound so that Jane seems more like an a-hole than she actually is (in his eyes, anyway). \n\nAs for the wedding, you don't have to invite anyone you don't want at your wedding. Parents aren't entitled to a invitation to your wedding just because they're your parents, especially if they aren't paying for it. If they wanted unfettered access to Jane's life, maybe they should have treated her better. I honestly can't imagine telling someone they have to include someone they don't like/have contact with in a major milestone in their life just the make the person *they don't have contact with* happy. That's absurd.", "You\u2019re allowed to think whatever you want about Janes choices and behavior. But you don\u2019t get to have a \u201cdecision\u201d. You don\u2019t get to decide if they\u2019re there. Jane does. She said no, and you said \u201cfuck that I know better\u201d", "As far as you are concerned, they did nothing wrong, to Jane they did something that warranted her keeping well away from them. It was entirely her business to start off with, not yours, not your parents. YTA for only thinking of yourself and what you want.", "So, what you\u2019re saying is that disregarding people\u2019s boundries and meddling in things that don\u2019t concern you whatsoever is something you inherited from your parents.", "I'll take \"decisions that were never yours to make and how dare you presume to make them anyway\" for $500.", "Sounds like you are just as oblivious as your parents. In both cases it wasn\u2019t your place to invite your parents when she specifically didn\u2019t want them there and it wasn\u2019t their place to share her medical information with anyone. Both were huge violations of trust. I hope she continues goes no contact with you as well as you show no remorse.\nYTA", "The fight before doesn't matter. What matters is, that Jane did not want them at their wedding. You broke her trust, just like her parents did back then.", "Please don't be surprised if your sister cuts you out of her life permanently. You had no right to disclose that info. Maybe you will finally learn to mind your own business.", "So, you don't understand. You were just on your parents side all along. you PRETENDED to be on your sisters side. LURED her into believing she can trust you. Only to stab her in the back in the most horrible possible way. I hope she never speaks to you again.\n\nAnd nobody cares if YOU believe, her going no contact is invalid. This is HER decision to make, not yours.\n\nYTA", "It was not THEIR PLACE to tell her ex about something personal.\n\nJust like it's not YOUR PLACE to ruin her wedding by inviting guests she specifically didn't want there.\n\nI'd have kicked you out of my wedding for it too. It sounds like you and your parents need some SERIOUS work on respect and boundaries. Yikes.", "You don't get to make that decision. You and your parents are unbelievable!", "Your family (including you) really love to stick your noses into where it doesn\u2019t belong and make decisions on behalf of others.\n\nGood riddance that your sister see you for who you are and can go low contact with you too\n\nYTA", "Well you and your parents opinion being more important than the boundaries your sister lays out is exactly why you and your parents now have ruined relationships with your sister.\n\n**Congratulations!** You got to be right! Just like your parents feel they are, and now none of you have access to your sister and likely never will. \n\nSo being right and proving your opinion is most important cost you your relationship.", "No means no. YTA", "That wasn't your call to make.   Jane had decided that at *her* wedding she didn't want your parents.    That was her choice.   You overrode it.   From now on, let Jane manage her own relationship with your parents.\n\n> my parents did nothing wrong but simply be honest with Jane's ex.\n\nLet me rephrase that.  \"My parents disclosed medical information about my sister that she wasn't ready to share.\"   Again, they overrode her choice.\n\nBeware.  This can happen to you, too.", "It\u2019s not your parents business to involve themselves in her relationship, and it\u2019s especially not your business to invite them to an event where they were not wanted. All of you have crossed huge boundaries and wonder why your sister wants nothing to do with any of you.", "How is sharing private medical information \"nothing wrong\". If it was nothing wrong Hipaa wouldnt be a thing", "EVEN IF they were right, that still leaves her with full rights to refrain from inviting them. an action, however just someone is in taking it, can still hurt or make you dislike a person. \n\nIDC who was in the wrong or right, it is Jane's absolute right to invite whoever the hell she wants to to her wedding. she clearly is still in the rocks with her parents, so she doesnt want them to come. her desicion should be respected, no matter the cause, because its HER goddamn wedding, not yours or your parents. \n\nIt does not matter whether the sharing of medical info was right, it made her feel bad, so she didnt want her parents there. so they shouldnt fucking be there. it is not their event. neither is it yours. so none of you have anything to do with it. \n\nit also comes of as absolutely delusional that you thought she would be happy to she them there. \n\nYTA", "Do you think your sister should have avoided telling you the address if she didn't want your parents there?\n\nYes or no. Evasive answer means yes.", "It wasn\u2019t your decision to make because it wasn\u2019t your wedding. You chose your parents over your sister and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to forget that. You\u2019re a major AH.", "Ok, your whole family seem incapable of understanding boundaries. Your parents divulged personal information without consent and then you did the same. \n\nYou can have opinions but you have no right to override Jane\u2019s decisions. I hope you enjoyed your relationship with her because it\u2019s likely over and probably a good thing for Jane. \n\nYTA", "it was not your decision to make. YTA", "It doesn't matter if you feel like it was something they should know. Jane set a boundary and your parents crossed it betraying her trust and disrespecting her. Now she set a boundary of not having them at her wedding and you betrayed her trust and disrespected her. Not only that but you've ruined her special day.", "I mean, you're allowed to feel some kind of way about Jane hiding her medical condition from her ex fiance. And if you wanted to go LC or NC with her because of that, that would also be your choice and within your rights to do. What is not okay, however, is you thinking you have any right to make decisions regarding who is invited to her wedding or her relationship with your parents. That is a huge breach of trust.  You were completely in the wrong to do what you did and I would not be at all surprised if Jane stops having any kind of contact with you.", "\"I understand, but\" means you think you know better. Grow up and respect other people's choices. Your sister is an adult capable of making her own decisions. She made it clear that she didn't want them there and you knew that. Congratulations, you just ruined your relationship with your sister and any remotely potential chance your parents may have had for reconciliation. You are still saying they did nothing wrong by divulging her PERSONAL MEDICAL history. WOW, just WOW", "It's none of your business, and you make no decisions about other people's wedding.\n\nHopefully she never speaks to you again since you're too selfish to respect boundaries.\n\nYTA", "Info: what did they tell the ex?", "This sort of logic/reasoning is exactly what I mean by your parents will get to her through you.", "Then invite your parents to YOUR wedding. You don't get to decide for your sister, especially since she didn't want them there!", "Info: what was the medical issue?", "Maybe one day when you are more mature you\u2019ll understand what a terrible thing you did to her.", "Look it wasn\u2019t your call to make. It was your sisters wedding if she made the decision to not have your parents there then that\u2019s her right. You fucked up big time here. YTA.", "YTA \n\nWow so you want your sister to go NC with everyone in her immediate family, huh?", "I'm sorry your parents chose this event to prove to you how manipulative they are, but yeah - regardless of why, YTA. She has boundaries in place for her life & you guys disregarded them. Period.", "But still. You\u2019re entire argument is about what your parents want, not Jane.\n\nIt\u2019s her life, wedding, decision.  \n\nYTA", "You don\u2019t understand because if you did you wouldn\u2019t have given your parents the address. YTA.", "\u201cYour\u201d decision? It wasn\u2019t your decision to make. Huge YTA.", "INFO was your parents getting kicked out of their daughter\u2019s wedding better than missing it?", "It\u2019s not your decision though! Who cares if they did something we understand and agree with or not. You\u2019re just as bad for going against your sisters wishes. Your opinion does NOT matter. You\u2019re an AH. Don\u2019t be surprised when your sis doesn\u2019t talk to you or your parents ever again. Second chances happen, but a third not so much.", "It was still HER relationship to communicate about. They took her providence away and for that goodbye. Now it\u2019s your turn.", "Stop. Just stop judging your sister. And stop letting your parents manipulate you. No wonder your sister is upset. You just keep throwing her under the bus.", "Hope it was worth it.", "She said no. Respect her no. No means no.", "The only people who are NTA are Jane and her husband. You are a disloyal AH and your parents are manipulative AHs.", "There\u2019s way more to this you\u2019re leaving out. You say they have always not gotten along. Sounds like the issue with her ex was just the last straw.", "You prioritized your parents\u2019 feelings over Jane\u2019s VERY EXPRESS wishes ON HER WEDDING DAY and you want to know if you\u2019re the asshole? Yes. You are.", "You clearly got your emotional intelligence from your parents.", "INFO: what was (is) the medical condition?", "None of you have any respect for your sister. Your parents didn't respect her medical privacy or her decision to not have them at her wedding and these are the only incidents you've told us about. You clearly have no respect for her, mirroring your parents. Why would she want to be around any of you?", "Still not your place or business. \n\nYou can have your opinion on what happened, but reasonable actions stemming from an opinion are confined to anything that affects you, and you alone. Telling your parents widened the effects of your opinion negatively on your sister. That was unreasonable behaviour from you.  \n\nNow, Jane has had to go no contact with you as well as your parents, and you know whose fault that is? Yours. YTA.", "OP wouldn't be the one sending a thank you card as it was the sister getting married, not them. So, I think you may have meant they wouldn't be receiving one.", "Classic golden child", "for real", "I mean, I obviously suspect fertility issues. It would be completely fucked to be engaged to a person and not tell them.", "Marrying someone deceiving you about that sort of issue can be grounds for an annulment. I know I\u2019ve seen a post around here about someone debating on whether to tell their BIL - who was hoping and trying for a child with his wife - that their sister was infertile and had known so for years before their wedding."]}
