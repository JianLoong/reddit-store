We delayed our public announcement until 17 weeks, aware of our sister-in-law's recent miscarriage. Despite her knowledge and our efforts to be considerate, she expressed anger and sadness after we shared our news. While I believe in supporting each other, I'm questioning if we did something wrong. Am I the asshole in this situation?*\n\nMe and my wife have been trying for children for 3 years with 3 miscarriages and multiple years of infertility. We started IVF almost 6 months ago from the initial consultation and got amazingly lucky - our first IVF implant was a success. We have been waiting for the 16-week mark before making a public announcement in fear of losing another baby all this time. (Most people announce around 12 in the UK)\n\nOur sister-in-law is fully aware of all our troubles over the last 3 years and that we are now pregnant from IVF already, she knew since the first test showed positive. She had said she didn't want kids for another 3 or so years when talking but then she and her husband decided to start trying and got pregnant in their 2nd month\n\nSadly they lost their baby 2 weeks before we had our planned public announcement on social media to share our story, including the lows and what we have been through to get there. Think sort of a here's the journey we had to go on and we want to share so people know there's hope.\n\nMy wife messaged her and has been there for her and let her know we will be posting soon plus we delayed it an extra week for them to 17 weeks. SIL didn't acknowledge any message or ask us not to. The day after we posted she bombarded my wife with \"How could you do this...\", \"You should know how it feels\", and \"Why couldn't you wait longer\" messages.\n\nI'm trying to stay out of it but I feel like she's making us out to be the Asshole here I was sure that we did everything right and even delayed our happy announcement longer just in case it upset them. Now I'm wondering AITA?  \n\n\nEdit - Acknowledging i have my wifes back but shes asked me to not get involved and let her talk to her sister, trust me i want to get involved but it will cause more harm than good.

Did she expect you to announce it when the baby was graduated? \n\n NTA, it\u2019s sad she miscarried but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t share anything about your pregnancy.", "NTA and congrarulations on your happy news!\n\nImo you took every precaution possible - postponing, warning her in advance. \n\nBut please consider that SIL is grieving and cannot think straight - which is completely understandable. \n\nI'd ignore her remarks and focus on you and your family. She will probably realise at some point that her reaction was over the top. Just don't close any doors on your side, give her some leniency and focus on your little bubble of joy.", "NTA.. By 17 weeks it must be getting pretty obvious to others that your wife is pregnant. Does she expect your wife to just hide from everyone?", "NTA. You and your wife showed respect and empathy by waiting the extra week or two.  The SIL needs to be respectful of your situation also and the happiness and joy you and the wife are sharing and have been waiting for over three years for.  \n\nIt is horrendously sad for the SIL, but as someone else said earlier, life moves forward and she can\u2019t expect it stop forever. \n\nIt\u2019s probs not your place to say it as it will perhaps cause more animosity, but she may need to seek a therapist to help her move forward.  Your wife may be the best person to have that convo alone with her sister, but even then it could go wrong. \n\nCongrats to you and the wife on the great news and all the prayers for all of you.", "NTA. It might sound harsh, but the world doesn\u2019t stand still when you suffer a loss. \n\nYou and your wife were respectful enough to try and contact her ahead of time, and you even pushed back the date you\u2019d originally planned on. \n\nYou had news to be excited about. It\u2019s not fair to you for someone to expect you to put your own happiness on the back burner to cater to them.", "NTA at all. The SIL is misdirecting her grief.

It sucks but life goes on. You guys did IVF, which means this baby was prayed for, desperately wanted and welcome. You should be able to share that joy without it being co-opted by someone's grief.", "NTA if anything you know what your SIL has been through, she knows the journey you have been on and you reached out to her and got no response. Expecting you not to celebrate your pregnancy is selfish and ridiculous of her. I guess you\u2019re just going to have to ignore her negativity as your wife progresses throughout and has the baby.

She\u2019s grieving, but she\u2019s wrong. \n\nYes it feels like everyone else announcing healthy pregnancies is doing it to hurt you, but part of struggling with infertility is wrestling with the fact that life goes on despite your pain. \n\nIn fact, the estimate is as many as 1 in 3 women who has tried to have children have had a miscarriage. The pain is acute, but not unique. The world can\u2019t stop each time.\n\nWhen my father died in my mid-twenties, I didn\u2019t forbid other people from sharing about their dad\u2019s birthdays, or seeing dad at Christmas, or skip any wedding where someone\u2019s dad walked them down the aisle. I did discretely step out during a few Father-daughter dances, as it was acutely painful to see something I\u2019d never have. But that was me, managing my own pain, not expecting others to manage it for me. \n\nGive SIL space. She may never admit she\u2019s wrong, but if she\u2019s making angry lashing out statements like that, she\u2019s not going to accept anything but an apology\u2026 That you don\u2019t owe her.", "NTA if your sister in law can't be happy for you that's her problem not yours.

We do completely understand how you feel, because we have gone through this multiple times. We delayed our announcement in respect to your great loss. Unfortunately, we could not delay our announcement much longer because soon (if not already) my wife will be showing. As you know, we have waited a long time for this. It was either we announce or lose that opportunity because people were bound to notice soon. This was not at all directed at you. Some things that helped my wife and I were ________.

The answer is likely no time soon, if ever. \n\nLife goes on after tragedy. \n\nYou were kind and considerate to SIL to delay your announcement and to let her know you would be announcing soon.  \n\nEnjoy your pregnancy experience and share it how you like !  You worked hard for it. \n\nSIL, who is currently grieving and likely very hormonal\u2026will hopefully eventually come around  but meanwhile \u2026\n\nLife goes on.  \n\nCongratulations on your News !", "NTA. First congrats, I am also doing IVF and it sucks, so it\u2019s great when it works out. Second, you did approach this respectfully and you even informed her separately before the big announcement to prepare her. There isn\u2019t anything else you could have done and I think you and your wife are very thoughtful, SIL is just hurting and it\u2019s going to be difficult for her to be happy for anyone else right now. \n\nI would suggest inviting her to things like baby showers etc, privately and with the understanding she may not attend because it\u2019s too difficult for her. You\u2019re doing it as gently as you can now, and you are also naturally empathetic to her situation as you\u2019ve gone through it - but everyone grieves and handles pain differently.", "NTA. First of all - congratulations!\n\nYou did everything you could to be considerate to your SIL and her situation. And she had time to respond to you and make any requests. However, life goes on - you cannot go on pretending that your wife\u2019s pregnancy doesn\u2019t exist just because your SIL is hurting. And your SIL will need to accept that her tragedy is just that - her tragedy. I can only hope that this happened because her emotions are running high and she won\u2019t continue like this. \n\nUnfortunately, \u201cwhy couldn\u2019t you wait longer\u201d requests always seem to pile up and go longer and longer. And then you will be asked to not have a baby shower because it will remind her of her miscarriage.

You beed to make clear you have your wife's back.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nMaybe it's her first miscarriage and that's why she's lashing out.

You have no reason to feel guilty or like you did something wrong. Your SIL's grief is valid but she doesn't get to determine when and how other people announce their pregnancy. And what were you supposed to do? At 17 weeks your wife will either already show or start showing soon and then it's just a technicality as everyone can see.\n\nCongrats on your wife's pregnancy after all this time! And all the best for her pregnancy and the baby's development. I hope all goes well because clearly, you've been waiting and hoping for this for a long time!", "NTA you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, it\u2019s hard for the SIL sure but what, nobody can have a baby, or if you do it\u2019s a secret ? No I don\u2019t think so", "NTA. You gave her advance notice and even pushed back your announcement an extra week out of respect for her loss.\n\nYour wife has experienced multiple losses herself. Did SIL give HER the respect she is now demanding ? Did she give HER notice she was pregnant before announcing ? \n\nSounds like your wife, having suffered multiple losses, took her feelings of grief aside and celebrated SIL\u2019s pregnancy news anyway. Now that SIL is standing in her shoes, she\u2019s expecting the world to stop for her one loss when she likely didn\u2019t pause for any of yours.", "NTA - You waited until you were out of the first term. And then even an extra month.  People were going to know she is pregnant soon. You gave them time.\n\nShe's also grieving and is speaking out of grief and deserves a little empathy.  but not a change in how you handle your pregnancy.", "NTA.  You and your wife have gone through the pain of loss and fertility treatments.  That SIL is making this about her is reprehensible, especially after you have suffered 3 miscarriages yourselves.  It's probably pretty hard for you to not put her firmly in her place for causing stress to your wife!  If SIL doesn't back off very quickly and, if not offer support to her sister, at least keep her thoughts to herself, I hope your wife blocks her for awhile to keep this out of your lives for now.", "NTA. It would have been one thing if you blindsided her with a public announcement, but she knew. Perhaps it might have been courteous to let her know it was coming, but you can\u2019t revolve around her grief. Also, she is still processing her grief and likely still has hormones out of wack, which is making this feel harder for her than it is. Perhaps a nice note or text acknowledging her struggles without apologizing for how you handled things?", "NTA. They are two separate events, that have nothing to do with each other. \n\nShe knew your wife was pregnant, the announcement was going to need to happen at some point. \n\nI celebrated my sterilization on social media when I had the surgery and I had an old coworker who I don't speak with anymore message me and say it was insensitive for me to celebrate this while she has fertility issues. I knew she had them, but she hadn't worked with me in a couple of years and we weren't close anymore. I told her I failed to see how her fertility issues had anything to do with my choice to become sterilized.", "NTA. Congratulations! I have suffered 2 miscarriages, 2 failed rounds of IVF, and then a miracle baby that is my son. A friend that lost her pregnancy 4 years before my successful pregnancy was supportive of me until I was successful (basically while I was struggling). I haven\u2019t seen her in 5 years\u2026not for lack of trying. All this to say, no matter when you announce, SIL would have had a negative comment.", "NTA and congrats.  I went through 2 years of IUI, IVF, FET and never was able to get pregnant so I love stories like this.  As someone who has witnessed many friends and family get pregnant while trying it is really hard to witness.  You feel like an outsider and damaged etc.  However, I would never begrudge anyone their happiness and I think her sister will come around at some point.  People who get pregnant easily and don\u2019t experience infertility have no concept of how hard it is.  And that\u2019s not their fault it is just facts.  I had a friend miscarry 4 times and I can\u2019t imagine the pain of that because I haven\u2019t lived it.  \n\nThere is no monopoly on pain and grieve, we all feel it at times.  You can be happy and feel pain for her, hopefully at some point she will understand.  Have compassion and sympathy but you have to live your live and happiness as well.   Give her time and don\u2019t let this come between your families.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your wife have been through multiple miscarriages. You have a perspective that your SIL, who recent had what is presumably her first and only miscarriage, do not.\n\nSIL is grieving, and is new to the experience. Her complaints of \"you should know how it feels\" can be met either with grace and empathy or with anger.\n\nYou said SIL is bombarding your wife with accusations. Did she similarly bombard your wife with love after every miscarriage? If not, the one thing I suggest you do is tell SIL to back off. Simply put, you know far better than SIL does the pain of miscarriage after miscarriage. And SIL has only a tiny glimpse of what you and your wife have been through.\n\nAsk SIL why she thinks she's the only member of the family whose feelings and emotions matter. Tell her to leave you both alone until she finishes processing her grief, because you've lived through much more of that than SIL has. And you've learned that life goes on. SIL can resume speaking with you and your wife after she comes to that realization.", "Your sister could have avoided social media for a few weeks also, knowing you were going to announce. She could have muted you for 30 days. She was not without agency in this.", "My first daughter was stillborn at 8 months. I was devasted and very upset when I saw others with their new babies and bumps however I accepted that they were entitled to their happiness. Their joy did not diminish my loss.

We(humanity) have collectively decided to stop making new babies until your sil says it\u2019s ok to start again.

You could have told family & friends the news in person.\n\nYou warned your SIL about it and she had the option to ignore the social media posts.\n\nDifficult to call anybody of you an AH. SIL has enough reasons to grieve, you have enough reasons to be happy. So congratulations and I wish you all the best.", "NAH - She\u2019s in pain and it\u2019s natural for her to react.

It's not a news item, the entire world doesn't need to see it.", "NAH. Although the fanfare of announcing the pregnancy over SM could be construed as being a little tone deaf.\n\nIt's understandable you would want to publicize and share your news and there's nothing stopping you from doing this. However, your SIL is still raw and grieving over her miscarriage so her feelings are just as valid as your joy.", "Why are you \u201cstaying out of this\u201d when you seem to have been part of the planning and announcement? Why are you allowing your wife to take all this abuse and not stepping in?", "MTA. You asked she didn\u2019t answer. You also waited but you both she get to be excited about you baby.", "NTA although I feel so bad for your SIL. It's really painful to see pregnancy announcements right after a pregnancy loss, or during infertility struggles, etc. \n\nBUT that's not your problem. This is why when I work with patients who have had pregnancy losses, I talk through how they are going to handle announcements and we work on how, if possible, to reduce exposure to social media or other triggering situations. You can't avoid them completely, but also don't torture yourself. For example, if your friend is having a baby shower and you just lost a pregnancy and don't feel up to going, you don't have to go. But you can't be mad at your friend for having a shower. It's horribly painful but at the end of the day everyone deserves to celebrate their pregnancies and no one should have to hide or bend over backwards--it's incumbent on the person who lost the pregnancy to engage in their own self-care. Sounds harsh, but it's fact.", "NTA My condolences for your losses & congratulations on the baby!\n\n>Our sister-in-law is fully aware of all our troubles over the last 3 years and that we are now pregnant from IVF already, she knew since the first test showed positive. She had said she didn't want kids for another 3 or so years when talking but then she and her husband decided to start trying and got pregnant in their 2nd month\n\nWhy am I thinking that she got pregnant to steal your thunder & she's really mad because your birth announcement is going to take away attention from her. I think if the roles were reversed she would have announced it as soon as possible.\n\n\nI feel bad for people who struggle with fertility issues and pregnancy loss. People have the right so feel sad and angry **but** the world doesn't stop because they're struggling. She could  have stayed off line or something but she seems to like to create drama. She **knew** you and your wife were struggling. She knows about your multiple losses and she has the gall to act the way she does!", "I personally don\u2019t make social media announcements but to each their own. I call people individually to tell them if they\u2019re important enough to me to know something like that. Or else let it travel through the grape vine organically. Or else when I run into someone they\u2019re very surprised and we have a lot to catch up on, which is also fun. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a secret, but it\u2019s also privileged medical information that\u2019s still very early and I\u2019m a bit cautious about over sharing. \n\nIt\u2019s very common for the first pregnancy to end in miscarriage, your SIL might be 1/4 that has that experience. I did too. Or she maybe on a journey that is more similar to your wife/her sister. Only time will tell. She might be freaking herself out over having been witness to your experience. \n\nI\u2019m on the fence because I think NAH. Obviously you\u2019re within your right to handle your announcement whatever way you want. Though I understand why SIL is so sensitive atm, having been there myself, and I think her sister/your wife might be the best person to understand her\u2026 I think texting/messaging about stuff is a little impersonal, and also can lead to miscommunication. Especially such serious matters. Anyways, it\u2019s always good to give grace and maybe see that there were alternatives so it\u2019s not so bad to feel humble to someone\u2019s grief.", "There would never have been a good time to announce it if it were up to her.

Are you expected to wait until delivery?", "NAH\n\nThis is a tough one. Your SIL is grieving and lashing out. And I do feel bad for her.\n\nIt us a crappy situation really it is.

But you should focus on your own pregnancy and get to celebrate it.\n\nCongratulations!", "Messaged? MESSAGED??! \n\nThis definitely required at least a phone call and a compassionate conversation before posting on social media. \n\nYTA. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s been TWO WEEKS since her miscarriage, she might not have been checking her messages, hence the silence. \n\nWhat you guys did was willfully ignorant. You should have called her", "NTA but I still do not understand the need to announce things on social media. Why is it necessary? Those close to you can find out personally. The rest will find out eventually. Pregnancies can be risky till the end.\n\nI had 2 miscarriages before I could carry a pregnancy to term successfully. We never said anything on social media. Family and close friends found out when I was well into my fourth month (I was also high risk). Even photos of me at 6 months didn't really show so nobody really realised. When our daughter was born, we sent a photo of her to those we wanted to announce it. And that's it.", "YTA for staying out of it and not defending your pregnant wife. Your SIL already knew your were expecting and must have known you'd have to announce before it became obvious - your wife must have a bump by now.", "NTA.\n\nGet your wife out of that ball of shit asap. Your SIL is going through a hell right now and she's letting it go on your wife as a way to deal with her pain because it's easy to be mad at your wife than to be sad for her loss. Do not allow that. Your wife didn't do anything wrong, your SIL is being a prick and your wife needs stability and peace of mind, not that kind of drama in her life.", "100% NTA!", "NTA. Similar to SIL I was lucky enough to get pregnant very soon after we started trying but unfortunately lost the baby toward the end of my first trimester. It turns out a lot of people were also conceiving around the same time because in the weeks after we miscarried at least half a dozen close friends and family members announced their pregnancies for the same month that we were due. You know what I did? Cried like a baby for a while (in private) and then congratulated them like a mature adult. Miscarriages are awful but you can\u2019t expect other people to stop living their lives because of them. SIL is grieving but she needs to learn to cope with the fact that others are still going to get pregnant and have babies. If she\u2019s lucky, hopefully she will conceive again shortly like I did and go on to have a healthy pregnancy and baby.", "nta", "NTA. She\u2019s just struggling and putting it on your wife. It\u2019s sucks and is not fair or rational, so trying to understand it as a rational reaction won\u2019t work. I think all you can be is compassionate. Acknowledge her feelings while reminding her of how much it took for you guys to get here and that you are allowed to tell people because it\u2019s happening one way or another.\u201d", "NTA. You\u2019ve been through an exhausting and heartbreaking journey to get to this successful pregnancy. You guys should be able to share your exciting news and celebrate your baby. You were respectful to your SIL in waiting to announce and telling her beforehand rather than surprising her. She\u2019s grieving and reacting in a way that is hopefully not how she would normally act. Give her some time and space and enjoy your good news! Hopefully she\u2019ll realize she\u2019s in the wrong and be supportive eventually.", "NTA; you have the right to post your news,especially after your long route to this point. Maybe edit your audience in the future so they don't see your posts. Congrats on the baby!", "NTA and congrats!", "NTA.\n\nIt's sad that your SIL had a miscarriage, but if your wife announcing her pregnancy was going to bother her, she should have responded to your wife when she contacted SIL to check to make sure she'd be ok with it! Your SIL is now creating drama and making your pregnancy announcement all about her.", "NTA.  You are free to announce your news whenever you want.  You SIL regardless of her situation has no control or any say in what you do.  Her circumstances do not stop the rest of the world from carrying on as normal.", "NTA\n\nThere will never be the right time\nAnd at 17 week you are so far a long that it really is time to say something\n\nIt\u2019s like my friend who got pregnant and her sister cut her off brcause she couldn\u2019t have more children. \nLife goes on and sometimes it hurts", "Your SIL\u2019s loss is tragic but you and your wife have a right to be able to enjoy the experience and excitement of bringing pregnant at last.   Congratulations!   NTA", "NTA. You did everything you could to be sensitive. At this point just give her space. Congrats on the baby, also had all my kids through IVF.", "SIL needs to learn that not everything is about her. Other people have lives and struggles and happiness. She needs to grow up", "NTA. Congratulations!!! Life is meant to be celebrated especially a wanted pregnancy. Your SIL is hurting but she must understand that this has nothing to do with her.", "How long did your SIL wait to announce her pregnancy, so that she wouldn't upset you and your wife, who had so struggled to have a child?\n\nNTA.", "You all waited even longer than is fairly typical, after 12 weeks, to share your news. You did everything to be considerate to SIL and her feelings. Sometimes people are just not going to react very well no matter what, and this is one of those times. Don\u2019t be upset over it, I think SIL will come around. Her feelings are still very raw right now.", "NTA, and congratulations!!", "NTA\n\nYou delayed it but apparently no amount of time would be enough. They are lashing out and it\u2019s due to grief. You did nothing wrong.\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy. Best of luck!", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why some people think that no one else is entitled to experience joy and want to share it, unless they themselves also experience it. You did nothing wrong! Why do you need to stop yourselves being happy because of SIL own difficulties? You can be sad and there to support her whilst also enjoying your own pregnancy. Congratulations guys I\u2019m very happy for you and so glad after so long trying you\u2019ve been blessed with a baby.", "Yea, NTA. SiL needs to seek some therapy. Did she want you to wait until the baby is born to announce? Geez. Some people just live in their own bubble.", "NTA\n\nCongrats on the pregnancy! \n\nYou and your wife were respectful enough and did everything you could to be mindful of them but now the are the ones that have to realize that the world doesn\u2019t stand still and that other peoples lives can\u2019t be changed or stopped because they went through something hard and sad.\n\n\nThey don\u2019t have the right to dictate when,how and where you announce your pregnancy and its milestones. Ask them if they would be as mindful if it was you in their situation, cause most of the time the people that act this way are the first one that wouldn\u2019t have the same consideration for others and would be complaining about it being unfair that they can\u2019t share their pregnancy experiences because they\u2019ve struggled a lot with them.", "NTA..you will only be parents for the first time ONCE:.. go all in ...outerwise you will regret it forever", "NTA", "NTA- something similar happened to us. We were aware it was coming, warned the couple that we wish them congratulations privately but that\u2019s all we could do at that point. They were completely understanding and let us have our space. I don\u2019t know what else you could have done to make it better for them. At 17 weeks it\u2019s about to be obvious to everyone so you gotta do what you gotta do at that point.", "Nta.", "NTA.\nYour SIL knew you were pregnant, so it\u2019s not like she was blindsided by the news.

You waited some extra time out of empathy for her loss, but you also deserve to announce your journey. \n\nYou have no expectations for her to be over the moon - you respect her loss and needing time to grieve. \n\nBut your life shouldn\u2019t be on pause. Nothing you did was going to blindside her. You did not steal anyone else\u2019s event.\n\nYou announced your happy news and that is allowed. \n\nCongratulations on your successful IVF journey!!!", "If it was on the day, a week after or maybe even two after, at a push.. I would say you were a bit insensitive... But pregnancy moves fast and people are going to start guessing, three weeks is enough tome. So NTA.\n\nCongratulations to you both and I'm sorry for the loss in your family.", "NTA.\n\nI think the most important thing here is, SIL knew from the positive test result that your wife is pregnant. She wasn't blindsided with the news of the pregnancy. Even then, you gave her advance notice that you could soon be sharing your good news. \n\nBut your SIL is probably right about one thing in her messages to your wife, when she says your wife should know how it feels. Because I can't imagine, with the losses you and your wife have experienced, that she has not seen/heard announcements from friends, co-workers and perhaps even family in that time. And I doubt your SIL even understands yet how long would be long enough. \n\nUnless your wife was expected to act like actresses in tv shows, hiding their pregnancy on tv by hiding behind oversized handbags, vases full of flowers, etc, what was she expected to do? \n\nI would also note another thing: Your SIL had prior warning. She could have turned off her own SM for a period to avoid seeing it. The fact she didn't suggests either she didn't think it through or she didn't realise how much the announcement would affect her.", "I understand she\u2019s grieving, but these are the kind of selfish people that differentiate themselves from those who understand that good things happening for the ones they love should still be celebrated. Regardless of whatever shit I was going through, if I found out my sibling was finally on their way to a successful pregnancy after years of trying, I would never make them feel bad about it or demand they prioritize my own emotions over their happiness. If anything, I would use that happiness to help lift me up. I\u2019d get to be an aunt! It\u2019s about perspective and not about me, me, me.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife is going to start to show sometime soon, and you do want family and friends to know about this very exciting time for your family. You did everything you could do to cushion things for your SIL - told her privately in advance, etc. - and there is a point where there just is not more you can do.\n\nOne of the hard things about fertility issues is that other people's lives continue even while yours feels stuck. You and your wife certainly have plenty of experience of that. IMO, you just have to live your life, make reasonable efforts at compassion, and let people feel what they feel.", "1. Sorry for everyone's losses \n2. Congratulations \nAnd 3. NTA you gave her a heads up while also comforting her in a time of need. She decided to not acknowledge anything so there rlly was no confirmation that she was or wasn't okay with the already pre-planned announcement thay was already delayed in consideration of her and her husband. But now you have to take this situation in a cautious territory as she's lashing out with pain and maybe even jealousy. However, if later down the road she continues this act I suggest going LC as the stress she projects isn't worth your wife picking up on while pregnant herself.", "NTA. We\u2019ve been trying for two years and I (the wife) have been STRUGGLING. But I never expect people to not live their lives and celebrate their successes because of the unfairness of my situation. Do I know that some people treat me delicately? Do I know some friends purposely do NOT have conversations about kids and pregnancy around me? Do I have people that check in on me when I \u201clike\u201d someone else\u2019s pregnancy or birth announcement on social media? Yes. Do I expect them to? No. \n  \nYour wife is under no obligation to treat your SIL with kid gloves. Plus you say that she already KNEW. She just wanted everything to be about her.", "As someone who lost their baby a week ago at 25 weeks, I feel if my sister had to make this announcement, the way you noted in your post that you and your wife forewarned her, is the correct way. If your SIL had an issue, the correct time would have been when your wife reached out and delayed by a week. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou were at 17 weeks. How long can you really wait before you tell people? Oh btw I\u2019m in the hospital having a baby. Sorry we couldn\u2019t tell you before because sister would be upset.", "NTA. Waiting another week or two wouldn\u2019t have made the sister feel any better. The sister also already knew so you telling others doesn\u2019t crazily affect her. Most women start to show at about 20weeks so your wife probably couldn\u2019t hide it much longer anyway. The sad fact is there are lots of miscarriages before 12 weeks. You and your wife have experienced some. Your sister was maybe 8 weeks along. It\u2019s terrible, but it happens. Life has to go on.", "NTA, she already knew your wife was pregnant, so she wasn't surprised by the news. You also put it off a few weeks to be considerate. How long did she expect you to wait? She's still going to be recovering emotionally from her miscarriage in 2 more weeks,  and 2 weeks after that, and 2 weeks after that, and on and on. No time would have been a \"good\" time for her. You guys went through a lot to get pregnant,  so you do know what she's going through as far as hearing announcements and the pain that can come with that. But eventually, it has to be acceptable to announce a pregnancy.", "NTA, but cut your SIL some grace. She may still be rebounding hormonally. (As someone who has had multiple miscarriages, I know what this is like.) Couple that with the emotional distress, and of course she's not going to be her best self in any situation. I think you waited as long as you could. Your wife must be beginning to show; you can't hide it forever. It sounds like you tried to connect with SIL about it, but likely she's too overwhelmed to have responded. Please, don't be angry with her. Be as sympathetic as you can be, but just keep carrying on as you need to. Decorate a nursery, have a shower, get regular checkups, all of it. Maybe be a bit careful about what you post in social media. I understand the excitement of wanting to share it all, after so much difficulty in arriving where you are. Or maybe gently ask her if she'd prefer you block her on social media for a while so that she's not bombarded with these kinds of posts. Just do your best to talk to her in the most sympathetic way you can. She's NTA either. The situation is so complicated. And I don't want to forget to add: Congratulations!!", "NTA, honestly for these situations typically there isnt a best time to announce it and the person with a miscarriage always gets upset no matter how much time has passed", "NTA\n\nI was in the exact situation of your SIL. It never occurred to me to be anything but utterly delighted that my sister at long last could welcome a baby of her own. \n\nCongratulations! I hope you find being parents as wonderful as us. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA- it\u2019s crazy how entitled people feel these days. Also, social media doesn\u2019t help. She should be happy for you guys. Her hormones might still be off, who knows. From an outside perspective, I don\u2019t think you guys have anything to be sorry about at all.", "NTA.  There's nothing you can do about the timing.  She's pregnant.  That's a fact. The baby will arrive, that's a fact.  You can't delay this, and you can't hid it.\n\nGive your SIL some grace.  She (hopefully) knows deep down inside she's being unreasonable, but her grief is causing her to lash out.  Don't engage with her, let your wife handle her own sister, and just keep an understanding, but unwavering stance.  You did nothing wrong, but your SIL is in a tough state of mine.  Know you did the right thing, and don't take your SILs comments personally or get upset.", "NTA. Congratulations! I\u2019m so happy for you guys that you were able to fall pregnant after so long! Enjoy this time in your life.", "She should be happy for you.", "NTA.  The world does not stop turning for everyone else when tragedy strikes you.  They are not doing something to just make you hurt more, they are just living their life.", "Nta! She already knew you were pregnant and that you would be announcing soon, so it\u2019s not that it came across as a surprise to her. It\u2019s sad for her loss, but it sounds as though you have been both supportive and sensitive. That\u2019s really all you can do. Don\u2019t go to war over this. Let her run out of steam, because she will. If you value that relationship, step back while she grieves, just be kind and supportive.", "17 weeks I was already showing (I'm short AF and little so there was nowhere for baby to go but out). I gained 16 pounds in the first 3 months and never gained another pound the entire pregnancy due to morning sickness. But my belly got huge. By 17 weeks I couldn't have not announced my pregnancy if I tried. My chest is small too so I couldn't just wear baggy clothes to cover the bump since I don't have big enough boobs to keep the stomach part lose. When breastfeeding I got to a C max. \n\nNTA- OP/wife were running out of time to announce it anyway most likely! Sure, plenty of women don't show THAT much at 17 weeks, but you can definitely start to tell they are pregnant by then. And you don't get to shut down everyone else's happiness and life events b/c u are having a hard time. How long were they expected to be quiet? If rolls were reversed how much you wanna bet the sister wouldn't have waited at all to announce it.  Not only that, how is an announcement, SHE ALREADY KNEW ABOUT, hurting her in anyway?

This baby deserves to be celebrated. And you shouldn\u2019t have to sneak around and hide it. \n\nThese are really two separate events, but unfortunately for your SIL she cannot see past her own grief to be happy for her sister.", "NTA. \n\nOfc she's hurt and angry - she just went through (is still going through) a miscarriage. Her feelings are completely understandable. You're celebrating finally getting pregnant. Y'all's feelings are completely understandable. Y'all did nothing wrong. \n\nShe shouldn't take it out on your wife. But I'm sure your wife understands and will give her some grace. \n\nHopefully, SIL won't take it too far. Give it time and space. Don't get involved unless wife asks. Forgive.", "NAH unfortunately it might be awhile before SIL has processed her grief enough to see the other side of this. Sounds like did things right in waiting a bit longer and giving her a warning. After so many losses it\u2019s natural to want to share and pregnancy can\u2019t necessarily be hidden forever. Your wife is right requesting you stay out of it for the time being.", "NTA, but your wife is right. Let her handle her sister.\n\nThe unfortunate fact of the matter is that there was probably never going to be a right time where her sister wouldn\u2019t get upset about it. And if you put yourself on her timetable, there was entirely the possibility that you would be making a birth announcement instead of a pregnancy one. You went about it in the right way. You waited a couple of weeks and you let her know ahead of time that you were going to be posting so that she could stay off of social media if she felt like she needed to to protect herself. Let your wife handle it from here.", "NTA and congratulations \ud83c\udf7e you can\u2019t stop your life because of the misfortune of others.

Your SIL is offense trolling you. She sounds manipulative and selfish at best. You did nothing wrong, whatsoever. Maybe you should discretely limit how often you're around her, and observe her around your future child- her jealousy and ugly personality may harm your child's self esteem in subtle ways-- down playing the child's achievments and being passive aggressive. This can really hurt a kid.  At celebrations like baby showers, and your child's birthdays, she may do something to garner attention and sympathy from others, and ruin the occasion.  She's already doing that and your child isn't even born. Don't let her  BS ruin your happiness or that of your child.", "NTA.\nI think it is so sad that people make their loved ones feel they have to walk on egg shells constantly and have to hide very exciting and happy news, just to protect their feelings.

I would ignore SIL and see if she apologizes later. Having had a miscarriage myself I empathize with the pain. It\u2019s not an excuse for being an asshole, but I would give them space because because people aren\u2019t robots. We make mistakes when we are struggling.

There is no actual path to satisfy people who are in the \"nobody else is allowed to be happy while I'm miserable\" mindset. You just have to tune them out and not engage until they get over it.", "Exactly. I\u2019m in a similar position to the OP. Struggling for 8 years to have a baby. Finally thought we were there, but had a second trimester miscarriage just over a year ago. My sister has struggled too, but for less time. She had a miscarriage before I got my positive. I told her about my success first. Then she told me about her next pregnancy first, which was after my miscarriage. She miscarried that one. I\u2019ve had 3 more transfers since my miscarriage, none of which were successful. She told me about her 3rd pregnancy before the rest of the family recently. I knew for several weeks before they did. So we both handled all of these life events with care and consideration of each other. It sounds like they did the same thing. They told SIL, reached out, told her about the upcoming announcement. There were no public surprises. \n\nBUT, she\u2019s hurting. And she will be for a while. When I found out I lost my baby, I had to wait 6 days for the surgery to remove her. Both of those dates weigh heavy on my mind. My sister happened to have a positive ultrasound between the first anniversary of those two things. When I had that ultrasound last year, I found out things were not right, but baby was still there with a heartbeat. She was sharing how excited she was in the family chat and how everything was good. I couldn\u2019t help but feel sad. Why was she doing this to me? Logical me knows she wasn\u2019t doing anything TO me. She did nothing wrong. But I was hurting. I had the good sense to mute that convo for a while and not participate. But things can be so hard for so long.", "it is!!", "This. We experienced something similar. My SIL had been trying to have a baby for years when my husband and I got married and then immediately conceived our son. It didn\u2019t help that I had just turned 39.

The day we found out she was pregnant I cried from the relief. She has two beautiful children now and we\u2019ve become close and talked through that difficult time.", "This!

I didn't expect them to not celebrate bc of my sadness.  It feels so wrong to me to demand that others can't enjoy the happy moments in their lives bc other people feel entitled to dictate when happiness is allowed.  \n\nIdk. It's just sad all around. Now there's grief and unnecessary tension and anger.", "to be clear i have her back :) shes requested me to stay out ill update the post", "Some people like to share parts of their lives, particularly happy parts of their lives, over social media. Some people don\u2019t. Both are ok. \n\nOP and his wife are experiencing something very exciting after a lot of pain and heartbreak. Wanting to share that excitement is not abnormal. \n\nPlus, they didn\u2019t just share that they\u2019re pregnant, they shared the story of their whole journey with infertility. People going through infertility often feel alone because no one talks about it. When I was dealing with multiple miscarriages, I appreciated posts like OP\u2019s because it reminded me that I wasn\u2019t the only person struggling and gave me hope that things might work out. I talked about my miscarriages openly on social media and had a lot of friends and acquaintances reach out to me because they were going through the same thing and they appreciated knowing that they weren\u2019t alone.", "As many years of marriage and knowing them plus my wife has directly asked me to not get involved. Trust me I very much want to pickup the phone but it's adding \"fuel to the fire\".", "If the SIL is her side of the family, she should handle it.  If it's his, he should step in.  Always handle your side of the family so they don't blame the inlaw.", "Message wasnt clear - my wife actually:  \n\n\nsaw her twice  \nhad several phone calls  \nand text messages", "I 100% understand your POV, but trust me if you met them you would know why I'm staying out of it and letting them resolve it. :D", "I am so sorry for your loss.", "Can I add:\n\nNo, you don't have to give up your paid for, pre selected airline seat.\nNo, you don't have to go to a child free wedding.", "*** with the caveat that you absolutely can tell people not to wear white on your wedding day.", "\u201c couldn\u2019t you just bind your tummy, you\u2019re triggering me\u201d", "\u201c couldn\u2019t you just bind your tummy, you\u2019re triggering me\u201d", "I agree with your first paragraph and am glad someone said this. You put it so well: time has stopped for them.\n\nThey may not feel embarrassed later. It depends on how long the pain lasts. I've never had a miscarriage, but I did have fertility issues before my first pregnancy, and there's just no way NOT to hurt when someone announces a pregnancy or gives birth. My good friend had a beautiful baby girl, and I visited her in the hospital with a baby gift and a smile on my face, then went home and cried my eyes out. I WAS happy for her. It was hard anyway. \n\nSometimes you just have to brace yourself for thie wave of pain you know is coming. The OP's SIL was going to hurt regardless of when or how the announcement was made. She shouldn't have said anything. I'd assume it was the pain talking in disguise and let it go.", "They are grieving, yes. But that doesn't excuse the lashing out. \n\nOP's wife delayed their announcement out of respect, and she shared her plans for when they would move the announcement to. That was her sister's cue to say \"Actually, that's too soon and I can't cope with it\" or \"Fine, but I'm going to mute your feed for a week because everybody's excitement is going to hurt\", or literally any other kind of feedback.", "I don't see how they were being a dick?", "She knew they were pregnant and knew when they planned to announce. It isn't reasonable to expect someone to delay even further. SIL needs to take some responsibility for her own triggers and stay off social media for a while if the announcement of a known pregnancy is going to send her over the edge.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an insensitive take at all. It\u2019s true. The world keeps turning even when something shitty happens to you.  My best friend and I were pregnant at the same time and I had a miscarriage right before she was going to announce. I\u2019d never expect her to stop whatever plans she had for announcing just bc I had a miscarriage.", "I mean, in the most respectful way possible, SIL can go through absolutely any sort of side effects, but OPs pregnancy is completely unrelated. OP is 17 weeks along, almost half way. They gave it 3 weeks, but it's not coming out of the blue AT ALL.", "It's really not, with the number of miscarriages that happen in my family no one would be able to announce their pregnancy until the baby is born. I have had miscarriages and I understand that the world doesn't revolve around me and that other people have their own lives to live regardless of what's happening in my own", "I hope so too, it would be a shame if her grief causes her to destroy her relationships with her family and miss out on getting to know her nibling. \n\nI hope she gets some grief counseling.", "It might be a good idea for your wife to mute SIL for a few weeks. Let the messages come through, don\u2019t look at them, let your parents in-law know the situation and let them handle it. \n\nAnyway, NTA and congrats!", "17 weeks is still pretty new considering the troubles you\u2019ve had. Extending grace to your SIL is the right thing to do, especially since nothing in life is certain and you might appreciate others\u2019 grace in the future.", "This. As someone who has struggled with infertility and is in the IVF community, the way in some spaces the anger and jealousy is validated in those spaces as okay (as opposed to being something to actively address and work through) is wild. Like why are you so deserving and a baby and celebration but someone who has it when you don't should just shut up and sit down to not make you feel bad?", "I'm going to stay out of it, but put a post on Reddit.\n\nYou are not wondering at all if you ATAH - you are probably just angry that your wife asked you to stay out of it so you couldn't vent directly to SIL.", "No, you don\u2019t have to go along with a brides ridiculous costume demands as the guests at the wedding i.e. Only wear Violet leather and your date must wear chaps, etc.", "And you don't have to let people watch you give birth.", "You forgot to add no, you don't need to go to destination wedding.", "Now it's 60%", "May I add No you don't have to go to the wedding of a HS friend's child that you haven't seen in ten years when it's two states away and you weren't offered a plus one?", "And you don\u2019t get to bring your kids to a child free wedding either.", "And you don\u2019t have to tell people what\u2019s in your will.", "I think it would be cool to have everybody ELSE where white, and the bride would wear a royal purple or something with the groom in black (or whatever he chose).", "I had a late term still birth, a week after the baby shower.  About 4 years later there was a baby shower at work and I went in the stairwell and broke down.  The person who the baby shower was for found me there and offered comfort. I really liked this person and held them in high regards, I am mildly embarrassed that on a day about them I couldn\u2019t hold it together.  I now know to call out sick or plan a day off when there is a baby shower.", "When I got \"accidentally\" pregnant with my son, my sister had gone through THREE miscarriages by that point and had just given up on having another baby. Meanwhile, I had drank way too much on New Year's Eve that year, blacked out, and slept with a friend of mine, didn't even realize it until I found out I was pregnant (I'd been celibate for a few years so wasn't on birth control). It was traumatic and felt so unfair that I ended up with the baby so immediately when my sister had been trying so hard and kept having to go through losses. \n\nThankfully, my sister is the most gracious person ever. She didn't show any upset or frustration toward me, never treated me any differently, and was happy to have a new nephew on the way, but I always feel pain when I think about it because the timing absolutely sucked and it had to have hurt her. But she never showed me that it did (albeit I was having a very rough time with the whole thing too, but my son is absolutely one of the lights of my life so I'm glad it happened). \n\nMan, this topic is rough for a lot of people.", "Of course.  Grief makes people kind of crazy for a little bit.  Sometimes, grieving people do shitty things.  Sometimes they just scream or cry.  I've seen grieving parents rip chunks of their own hair and scalp out.  Grieving people do lots of things they would've recognize as their own behavior just a few days or weeks later.\n\nThe SIL is still the asshole.  I'm just saying that she might not permanently be an asshole.  She may come around soon. She may never be able to apologize for being really shitty, but this is unlikely to be a reflection of how she behaves on a daily basis.", "This commenter compared the miscarriage to being upset about someone else having your haircut. \n\nComparing the two is remarkably insensitive. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t think the announcement should not have been postponed, etc. but comparing the two is just flat out wrong. \n\nThat\u2019s what this comment is about-reading comprehension is fundamental.", "Exactly. Your pain is there no matter what.", "That\u2019s you and your position on grief. \n\nI\u2019ve had 5 miscarriages and have never had a living child. I don\u2019t expect people to stop living but to compare it to being upset about a haircut like this commentor did is just flat out insensitive.", "This commenter compared the miscarriage to being upset about someone else having your haircut. \n\nComparing the two is remarkably insensitive.

They do for others.", "Absolutely. Like it\u2019s okay to not participate if it\u2019s too hard, but shutting someone down is unfair. We had a couple in our friend group that opted out for a bit while they were struggling with infertility. Seeing all the babies being born was too hard for them. They still congratulated friends who conceived, but avoided baby showers and generally went a bit quiet for a while until their miracle happened. I think that was healthy for them. Being peripheral to our happiness was all they could do. But they never made anyone feel bad or made their fertility struggles our problem.  They just politely declined invitations that made them uncomfortable. Of course we all threw them a huge party when it finally happened for them!", "You worded it so nicely. I also hate how these feelings are validated sometimes.", "I honestly need to see the wedding pictures from a violet leather & chaps marriage.", "This is a huge one. I've seen so many MILs get mad over this because they feel *entitled* to be there. It is NOT the pregnant mom's problem that the MIL wants to be in the room. Mom's comfort while giving birth is *more important than anyone else's feelings.* Yep. That means if mom doesn't want dad in there (especially in situations where they aren't together), he doesn't get to be in there either.", "For real! Where I'm from, the only people allowed to see you give birth are your birth partner/husband/wife and the medical professionals. That's it.\n\nBirth is not a fucking spectator sport.", "I've always wandered how you find 300+ people to invite to a wedding.", "When I was young (decades ago. LOL!), I attended several all-white weddings as they were very fashionable for a while. However, traditionally, at a wedding, ONLY THE BRIDE WEARS WHITE. For anyone else to do so is a dreadful faux pas and grounds for being removed from the wedding celebration.", "There was a great story on the wedding subreddits a while back about a MIL insisting on wearing a white dress for her sons wedding. There was no reasoning with crazy so the bride instead had her bridesmaids and mother wear white and she ordered her wedding gown in pink. Crazy mother in law was kept in the dark and showed up thinking she had won and instead spent the whole day scowling about having been outmaneuvered.", "That the guest of honour found you to comfort you? I'd let your embarrassment go. She obviously held no hard feelings, just understanding and kindness. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. I\u2019d say you handled yourself with dignity. Nothing to be embarrassed about. You excused yourself rather than making a scene. I definitely understand the embarrassment, but from where I sit, I see no need for it.", "No she didnt, she made a comment about the ridiculous request some people in the these posts have made, asking a family to postpone their announcement because of your personal issues is unreasonable, as are all the other examples in the comment. They did not say they are the same they said no one has the right to makes this request regardless of the reason. like you said reading comprehension is fundamental but if you dont understand their comment I dont expect you to understand mine. Have a day hun", "Your reading comprehension seems to have been misplaced. The comment you're mentioning is about the ridiculous demands people make on others, and mentioned how no one owns a specific hairstyle. I'm sorry for your losses, I have had multiple and it's not in any way easy however our grief is our responsibility to process not anyone else's to cater to."]}
