What exactly did your brother do that was so terrible?\n\nYou say \"my father didn't deserve the treatment.\" What treatment? You say your brother lived near your parents, helped them when needed, and gave them financial support. Then it sounds like he cut contact because of how your \\*mother\\* treated his wife. Since it sounds like you didn't like your mother (calling your brother a \"mama's boy,\" which shows a dislike of your brother and mother), I'd have thought you'd be on your brother's side, if your mum was bad to his wife.", "INFO\n\nSo did your mother ever apologize to your brother for the way she treated his wife?", "YTA.

That takes a *lot* of emotional abuse. \n\nYour brother going no-contact was a natural consequence of that abuse. It\u2019s great your dad changed and all, but it was too little too late.
