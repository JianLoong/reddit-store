Make your family with your boyfriend and go NC with the AHs in your family.", "NTA, but your parents certainly are. Your boyfriend lost his SISTER, and they expect him to be over it a MONTH later??? I lost my 70 year old brother in January and am still grieving - if I'd lost him when I was your boyfriend's age, I would have gone completely to pieces. What this sounds like to me is an expression of your parents' homophobia - as in \"you know how Those Gays are, always SOOOOOO dramatic.\" I can almost guarantee they wouldn't be acting this way if it was a girlfriend. Time to go low contact with your family until they can accept you for who you are.", "NTA.

But also, grief has no timetable and people respond to it in different ways. Make sure you have good support around you for both you and your boyfriend. Bereavement counselling can be helpful for some people though not usually in the first few weeks. \n\nThe thing I now know about grief that I didn\u2019t before my partner was bereaved is that some people get awful brain fog with it. Like, as bad as Long Covid brain fog. Forgetting simple things, not being able to do words, etc. And at the same time there\u2019s usually tons of admin to do. A perfect storm. Doesn\u2019t happen to everyone but happens enough that it\u2019s worth giving you a heads-up.", "Family doesn't mean blood. It means love, acceptance, and solidarity. Have you ever seen thick water? Yeah, it's a thing. So remember, sometimes water is way thicker than blood baby. Good luck, and I'm glad they have you to help them heal. Be strong.", "NTA. Fuck your family.

Toxic is toxic. Cut them out even if they are blood.", "Would your parents break up if either of them lost a sibling and felt miserable about it for longer than a month?\n\nI think not.

There are no time limits on processing grief and a month is a drop in the bucket. \n\nGood on you for not allowing your family to find fault over nothing because they need an avenue to not be supportive of your relationship.", "Agree with the vote but the logic needs to be much harsher.\n\nThere is a massive difference between \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cblood relatives\u201d.  Your family is your boyfriend, not the despicable idiots you\u2019re related to by blood.  They don\u2019t give a flying f*** about you.  Your boyfriend does.

I learned to live and move on, but I still get sad around her birthday and the date she died.\n\nOne month is not nearly enough time to mourn the lifetime you wish you could have had with them.", "NTA obviously. My intuition is that they have baaaaaarely come round on tolerating the fact that you're gay, and loving him through grief and vulnerability is bringing up how much they haven't actually accepted things. Seeing you guys as a unit, for better or for worse, when you're up or down, when things don't look peachy and get messy and complicated is seeing you guys loving each other as a verb and not just dealing with it as an idea or in the abstract. If they can't see why it's wonderful that you've found yourself love like you have, that's their problem. You're doing exactly the right thing for you.", "They are just grasping it as an excuse for you to break up and meet a nice girl instead. \n\nThey are even less accepting of you being gay than you think they are.", "NTA: It doesn't even compare to losing a pet. Just be there for him. It is going to take years to find a new normal for him. Months before he is out of brain fog. Trust me, I've lost 2 brothers. My husband has been through it all with me. It's like a part of your soul gone forever."]}
