Just my 2 cents. \n\nDefinitely NTA. In fact I think you have the right idea. If your dad gets mad, just tell him to see a therapist and get the courage to quit being a victim.", "NTA - it's your call to make. But you do know that you don't have to have anyone walk you down the isle. You can do it all by yourself.

It sounds like he really wants to be there for you he's just afraid, don't take what he said too personally as (you probably know) leaving an abuser is extremely difficult. People keep saying that he should just leave but it's not easy and unfortunately people who are in the older generations sometimes feel like they have no choice but to stay because it's been drilled in their heads that they have to stay and try to fix things. Even harder for men to leave because people don't like to believe that men can be victims of abuse.

No one needs to walk you down the aisle. It's an antiquated system linked to ownership of daughters handing off ownership to husbands. It's no longer needed.\n2. However, if you like the tradition of it (I had my brother walk me down the aisle), you can ask FIL to walk you down the aisle regardless if your father shows. FIL has shown you love since the beginning.\n3. If you REALLY want your dad to walk you down the aisle and he actually shows, there's nothing to say that both men can't walk you down the aisle.

He's trying to find a way to go to the wedding and risking abuse so he can be there for his child. We don't know their past and if he tried to protect his daughters against their mother. Abuse isn't easy, and it's different too for men because many people assume they can't be abused. Divorce court is also super messy it's not as simple as just leaving. And if he tried to divorce her when his children were younger he risked losing custody of his kids and not being able to protect them at all. \n\nIn the end we don't know what kind of man he is, only OP can determine if he deserves to walk her down the aisle if he is able to show up", "I beg to differ. If the kids are getting married, they are adults. Divorcing now, or just moving out is not a big risk. Having been in an abusive situation, I chose to protect the kids by leaving and ensuring they were protected. As an adult, I can choose not to fight against those who abuse me. As a parent, I must stand by my kids, especially when they are young. That doesn't make him evil, certainly. However if financial considerations or cowardice come before your kids, I'm positive you don't really deserve to walk them down the aisle.", "Have you been in an abusive relationship?", "OP isn't married to her mother. As soon as she turned 18 she was free to go wherever legally. It's not as easy as packing his bag and leaving, he has to legally divorce her which can be super messy and potentially leave him with nothing. Because he's a man, people are less willing to believe he can be a victim of abuse and that bias makes it harder for men to fight their case in divorce court.", "again, i know it's not easy, but you're asking  his daughter, who was also abused by her to be able to run in and save him. that's a big ask.", "YTA. If your dad finds a way to escape his hell hole to walk you down the aisle, let him. The FIL can be backup.", "Just a thought.  If you have your FIL dressed in a tux the same as the groomsmen and your father shows up, he escorts your MIL to her seat and looks great doing so.

Perhaps he considered leaving, but knew he would then be leaving the kids ALONE with her.\n\nChose to stay to try and take some of the abuse/protect the kids.\n\nWe're all glad that YOU had no issues leaving; however, I beg to differ that everyone can just do that.\n\nNOTE: I'm not saying \"dad\" was perfect/right/wrong/etc., but we DO NOT have a complete story and shouldn't make 'matter of fact' judgements.", "I have, and pippi2424 is 100% correct.", "100% correct for THEIR situation.  You have no clue what potential extenuating circumstances existed & it is ignorant to assume that you know.", "NTA", "NTA If my dad ever said anything like that to me I would've shut him out completely and when he called and said he would try to make it I would've hung up on him instantly honestly i would've been a fly swatter at that moment and he was a fly I would've made him drop dead.
