If you want him to come as a guest make sure he understands that he has no role in the wedding.  It sounds like asking your future FIL would be a perfect fit.", "NTA. That line he uttered is a cutting one. You don't elaborate on this but, if your mother was abusive and your father didn't protect you he doesn't deserve to walk you down the aisle anyways.", "NTA. I am so sorry for your situation and am glad you found a more supportive family. \n\nInfo: Does your mom abuse your dad too? Is that what he meant by the consequences of going? If so then NAH and I would let them both walk you together. But if not then I think you're totally in your right to just ask your FIL.", "NTA. Your father will always choose his wife over you. Being complicit of the abuse happening in front of you when you\u2019ve got the power to stop it  makes you just as guilty in my view", "NTA. Walking down the aisle and giving away the bride is a leftover from when women were property who were literally handed over by their fathers to their husbands.", "If you want your dad to walk you down the aisle. Fine. Make that plan A. There is nothing stopping you for talking to your FIL and saying \u201cmy dad isn\u2019t sure he will make it to the wedding with everything to do with my mom.  If he doesn\u2019t make it, could you walk me down?\u201d    Done. You hopefully get your dad. But in either case your FIL knows how much you appreciate him.", "NTA. It is your wedding and you can have the person of your choosing walk you down the aisle.  There is no right or wrong here. \n\nHowever you may have to deal with the consequences of your choice. If your dad is sensitive he may be upset--particularly if he has made some sacrifices with regards to his relationship with your mother to attend your wedding. Still that is not on you. Pick the one you want and have a great wedding.", "NTA...Your father has made is clear that his attendance is not guaranteed.  He's already made his choice.  You're free to make your own.", "NTA. You deserve to be walked down the aisle by the person who makes you feel safe and supported. Nothing else matters. Congrats on your upcoming wedding <3", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell dad you are just covering the risk of him not being able to come. And if your dad fails you, you have a dad to walk you down.", "If someone can't promise to be there for reasons other than health or true emergencies then having them walk you down the isle seems hallow to me. Just my 2 cents. \n\nDefinitely NTA. In fact I think you have the right idea. If your dad gets mad, just tell him to see a therapist and get the courage to quit being a victim.", "NTA - it's your call to make. But you do know that you don't have to have anyone walk you down the isle. You can do it all by yourself. That whole part of the ceremony is there because back in the day, the father was actually giving his daughter away and needed formally give his permission. You are no one's property and don't need to have anyone walk you down the isle if you don't want to.", "Your dad initially declined because he was afraid of what your mom would do if she found out. Dont take what he said personally. It isn't about you, it's about your mother.\n\nAsk your fianc\u00e9's dad if he will walk you down the isle if your dad can't make it. BUT make it clear to him that if your dad does show, then your dad will be the one to walk you down the isle.\n\nOR, you can have both of then walk you down the isle. There is no rule that says that you can't be walked down the isle by two people.", "NTA. Your dad sounds unreliable.  You shouldn't be spending the time leading up to your wedding making up lies to smooth over family issues.  Have someone else walk you down the aisle, or walk yourself.", "NTA at all, but is your mom abusive towards your dad too? Your mom is the AH for sure. But if your dad is being abused by your mom, I can't really call him one", "This is the way!", "I'll do it!", "Walk down with your maid of honor!", "Your Dad WANTS to walk you but is being ABUSED by your Mother.... \n\n\nYTA if you let that slide....", "You can have both walk you down. If he doesn't show up, FIL was already ready to do it. If he does show up, now you have two people to walk you down.", "Getting married at 21 is CRAZY. You won\u2019t last long with him tbh. Also, nta", "NTA, you're not a priority so he doesn't get the right to walk you down. The fact that he has to lie to be there says something.", "NTA - I walked myself down.  I didn't want my Dad and didn't want another person to step in. IF you end up asking your future father in law - I would at least give your Dad a heads up.", "Nta", "best solution! amen", "Exactly this! I don't understand why this is so hard to figure out.", "I know my mom definitely abuses my dad and yes that is what he meant by 'consequences' when he went to my sister's wedding my mom made his life a living hell for months after", "Exactly, I would tell Dad if he can make it you\u2019re so happy to have him as guest. But since he\u2019s not sure if he can because he\u2019s essentially refusing to prioritize her, he won\u2019t have a role in the ceremony. \n\nIMO, it\u2019s kinda rude to ask FIL to stand by in case dad (the guy who stayed with OP\u2019s abusive mother) doesn\u2019t show up\n\nNTA", "what's she supposed to do though? she's an adult, her dad is an adult. if he's unhappy, he should leave his abusive wife. is she supposed to go over there and fight with her mom, i'm afraid not.", "She mentioned in another comment that she is abusing her dad too", "This is the way", "I'm so so sorry OP, this is heartbreaking and must be so difficult as you plan what is supposed to be a fun day :(\n\nI think you should have both your dad and FIL walk you. Alternatively I think if you talk to your FIL about the situation he will understand and be happy to walk you if your dad isn't able to come. Personally I would give your father the option to walk you if he can make it, but I don't think you're an AH either way.", "Does your Dad not want out of this situation? It sounds like a living hell.", "There you go OP, MattTheCrow will walk you down the isle! LOL", "Yes! She should call out her Mum!", "I'm pretty sure that has probably already happened multiple times, which is why they're no longer on speaking terms. However, her Dad is a grown-ass man who should speak up for himself.", "Have you ever met an abused person?\n\nIf you reverse the genders would you say the same???", "yes i would say the same. OP has been abused by her mother too, yet you want her to run in with guns blazing. she has already extricated herself from the situation. why are you expecting one abused person to be able to do something that you don't think the other one will? if dad was saying he was trying to leave her but couldn't for whatever reason, yes OP should step in and help him pack his bags and get out, but he's not asking for assistance to leave, obviously.", "If he's unhappy he should just leave.....\n\n\n\nSay that again and imagine you're the abused spouse.....\n\n\nLeaving an abusive relationship ISN'T easy!\n\n\nHe's trying to be there for his daughter whilst also trying to stay alive.....", "NTA\n\nI'm gonna echo what other people have said, explain to your FIL the situation and ask if he can be prepared to walk you down if your dad doesn't show up, or walk down with both if he does.\n\nI saw you mentioned your mom also abuses your dad. It sounds like he really wants to be there for you he's just afraid, don't take what he said too personally as (you probably know) leaving an abuser is extremely difficult. People keep saying that he should just leave but it's not easy and unfortunately people who are in the older generations sometimes feel like they have no choice but to stay because it's been drilled in their heads that they have to stay and try to fix things. Even harder for men to leave because people don't like to believe that men can be victims of abuse. Divorce court is super messy and people need to understand that it isn't as simple as just packing up your bags and leaving.", "You can whoever you want, or NOBODY, walk you down the aisle!", "NTA - But here are some options.\n\n1. No one needs to walk you down the aisle. It's an antiquated system linked to ownership of daughters handing off ownership to husbands. It's no longer needed.\n2. However, if you like the tradition of it (I had my brother walk me down the aisle), you can ask FIL to walk you down the aisle regardless if your father shows. FIL has shown you love since the beginning.\n3. If you REALLY want your dad to walk you down the aisle and he actually shows, there's nothing to say that both men can't walk you down the aisle. Many of my friends had both of their parents walk them down the aisle. \n\nThere are no rules about who can walk you down the aisle or just walking in by yourself.", "NTA. Your wedding, your day.", "Plan to have them both walk you. You know you have one dad you can count on, and if he walks you solo, then so be it.", "This. OP, if your dad is willing to take a risk against an abuser, I'd pray he makes it, but have a plan b.", "She NTA, but it's the dad who is getting abused.", "OP mentioned in another comment that her mother abused her father for attending her sister's wedding so he is also a victim. \n\nI understand where you're coming from but also try and see his perspective. He's trying to find a way to go to the wedding and risking abuse so he can be there for his child. We don't know their past and if he tried to protect his daughters against their mother. Abuse isn't easy, and it's different too for men because many people assume they can't be abused. Divorce court is also super messy it's not as simple as just leaving. And if he tried to divorce her when his children were younger he risked losing custody of his kids and not being able to protect them at all. \n\nIn the end we don't know what kind of man he is, only OP can determine if he deserves to walk her down the aisle if he is able to show up", "I beg to differ. If the kids are getting married, they are adults. Divorcing now, or just moving out is not a big risk. Having been in an abusive situation, I chose to protect the kids by leaving and ensuring they were protected. As an adult, I can choose not to fight against those who abuse me. As a parent, I must stand by my kids, especially when they are young. That doesn't make him evil, certainly. However if financial considerations or cowardice come before your kids, I'm positive you don't really deserve to walk them down the aisle.", "Have you been in an abusive relationship?", "OP isn't married to her mother. As soon as she turned 18 she was free to go wherever legally. It's not as easy as packing his bag and leaving, he has to legally divorce her which can be super messy and potentially leave him with nothing. Because he's a man, people are less willing to believe he can be a victim of abuse and that bias makes it harder for men to fight their case in divorce court.", "again, i know it's not easy, but you're asking  his daughter, who was also abused by her to be able to run in and save him. that's a big ask."]}
