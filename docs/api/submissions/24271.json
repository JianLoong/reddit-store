This wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9. Not your dad.", "You would not be the AH.  Tell him thanks but that you have it covered.  If you want him to come as a guest make sure he understands that he has no role in the wedding.  It sounds like asking your future FIL would be a perfect fit.", "NTA. That line he uttered is a cutting one. You don't elaborate on this but, if your mother was abusive and your father didn't protect you he doesn't deserve to walk you down the aisle anyways.", "NTA. I am so sorry for your situation and am glad you found a more supportive family. \n\nInfo: Does your mom abuse your dad too? Is that what he meant by the consequences of going? If so then NAH and I would let them both walk you together. But if not then I think you're totally in your right to just ask your FIL.", "NTA. Your father will always choose his wife over you. Being complicit of the abuse happening in front of you when you\u2019ve got the power to stop it  makes you just as guilty in my view", "NTA. Walking down the aisle and giving away the bride is a leftover from when women were property who were literally handed over by their fathers to their husbands.", "If you want your dad to walk you down the aisle. Fine. Make that plan A. There is nothing stopping you for talking to your FIL and saying \u201cmy dad isn\u2019t sure he will make it to the wedding with everything to do with my mom.  If he doesn\u2019t make it, could you walk me down?\u201d    Done. You hopefully get your dad. But in either case your FIL knows how much you appreciate him.", "NTA. It is your wedding and you can have the person of your choosing walk you down the aisle.  There is no right or wrong here. \n\nHowever you may have to deal with the consequences of your choice. If your dad is sensitive he may be upset--particularly if he has made some sacrifices with regards to his relationship with your mother to attend your wedding. Still that is not on you. Pick the one you want and have a great wedding.", "NTA...Your father has made is clear that his attendance is not guaranteed.  He's already made his choice.  You're free to make your own.", "NTA. You deserve to be walked down the aisle by the person who makes you feel safe and supported. Nothing else matters. Congrats on your upcoming wedding <3", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell dad you are just covering the risk of him not being able to come. And if your dad fails you, you have a dad to walk you down.", "If someone can't promise to be there for reasons other than health or true emergencies then having them walk you down the isle seems hallow to me. Just my 2 cents. \n\nDefinitely NTA. In fact I think you have the right idea. If your dad gets mad, just tell him to see a therapist and get the courage to quit being a victim.", "NTA - it's your call to make. But you do know that you don't have to have anyone walk you down the isle. You can do it all by yourself. That whole part of the ceremony is there because back in the day, the father was actually giving his daughter away and needed formally give his permission. You are no one's property and don't need to have anyone walk you down the isle if you don't want to.", "Your dad initially declined because he was afraid of what your mom would do if she found out. Dont take what he said personally. It isn't about you, it's about your mother.\n\nAsk your fianc\u00e9's dad if he will walk you down the isle if your dad can't make it. BUT make it clear to him that if your dad does show, then your dad will be the one to walk you down the isle.\n\nOR, you can have both of then walk you down the isle. There is no rule that says that you can't be walked down the isle by two people.", "NTA. Your dad sounds unreliable.  You shouldn't be spending the time leading up to your wedding making up lies to smooth over family issues.  Have someone else walk you down the aisle, or walk yourself.", "NTA at all, but is your mom abusive towards your dad too? Your mom is the AH for sure. But if your dad is being abused by your mom, I can't really call him one", "This is the way!", "I'll do it!", "Walk down with your maid of honor!"]}
