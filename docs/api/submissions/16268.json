After the whole argument I pressured my mom into leaving the house because of how agitated she was so me and her went to her sisters house and stayed there for a little while until I went back to my dads house.

So if he's living in your house, I will not darken your door. But I'll meet you alone, at the coffee shop or wherever you designate: your call. Please know that I'm here for you Mom, I love, you, and you don't deserve to be treated like garbage.\"*\n\nIf Brutus is as abusive and horrible as he sounds, their relationship will tank again. And your mother will, unfortunately, need your help to pick up the pieces.\n\nBut if you totally cut contact with your Mom instead, Brutus will have succeeded at one of the things coercive controllers love to do: they ISOLATE THEIR VICTIMS. So please stay in your mom's life as best you can, while being totally up front and crystal clear about your position.\n\nNTA not to go to that house while the BF is present", "Nta, check up on your mom to make sure she\u2018s safe tho", "Obviously NTA for deciding you won't put yourself in the same space as an abusive person. Always, always prioritise your own safety. That includes emotional safety. I do hope you will find other ways to see your Mum, as long as she treats you well, you are safe and no one abusive is present.\n\nIf you are a child or teenager please tell an adult about your concerns. Your not responsible for supporting your Mum with her relationship problems and should not try to be involved in that.", "NTA\n\nIf you\u2019re an adult, make it clear to your mom that you are a safe space she can come to when she decides to leave.\n\nHe was comfortable doing that *while you were there*. Imagine how much worse it gets when they\u2019re alone.\n\nDo not be around him. Do not support the relationship. But support your mom. Meet away from him, not in their house. Or just make it clear you still love her. Reiterate that she deserves better, that how he treats her is *not* okay.\n\nDon\u2019t let him isolate her from you.", "NTA as that is your choice not to be around someone with anger issues who has spoken to your mom like that. But call or FT your mom often, keep a check on her and maybe you could meet somewhere else, set up lunch dates. Or visit her when you know he won't be there. And although your mom is the adult and it isn't your responsibility to keep tabs on her, please make sure you do at least a weekly check in. And even ask how Bf is doing, if he's gone to therapy, how is he managing his anger etc. Show an interest on his wellbeing but let her know you just aren't comfortable being around him where he could snap at any minute.  You mom should understand. Make sure she knows you aren't asking her to choose between you and him, but that as of now you just aren't comfortable around him.", "I would say your not entirely wrong but you should still see your mom cause leaving her alone with an abuser isn't the best thing. maybe he's changed but don't believe it till you've seen proof", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
