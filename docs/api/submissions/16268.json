So if he's living in your house, I will not darken your door. But I'll meet you alone, at the coffee shop or wherever you designate: your call. Please know that I'm here for you Mom, I love, you, and you don't deserve to be treated like garbage.\"*\n\nIf Brutus is as abusive and horrible as he sounds, their relationship will tank again. And your mother will, unfortunately, need your help to pick up the pieces.\n\nBut if you totally cut contact with your Mom instead, Brutus will have succeeded at one of the things coercive controllers love to do: they ISOLATE THEIR VICTIMS. So please stay in your mom's life as best you can, while being totally up front and crystal clear about your position.\n\nNTA not to go to that house while the BF is present", "Nta, check up on your mom to make sure she\u2018s safe tho", "Obviously NTA for deciding you won't put yourself in the same space as an abusive person. Always, always prioritise your own safety. That includes emotional safety. I do hope you will find other ways to see your Mum, as long as she treats you well, you are safe and no one abusive is present.\n\nIf you are a child or teenager please tell an adult about your concerns. Your not responsible for supporting your Mum with her relationship problems and should not try to be involved in that.", "NTA\n\nIf you\u2019re an adult, make it clear to your mom that you are a safe space she can come to when she decides to leave.\n\nHe was comfortable doing that *while you were there*. Imagine how much worse it gets when they\u2019re alone.\n\nDo not be around him. Do not support the relationship. But support your mom. Meet away from him, not in their house. Or just make it clear you still love her. Reiterate that she deserves better, that how he treats her is *not* okay.\n\nDon\u2019t let him isolate her from you.", "NTA as that is your choice not to be around someone with anger issues who has spoken to your mom like that. But call or FT your mom often, keep a check on her and maybe you could meet somewhere else, set up lunch dates. Or visit her when you know he won't be there. And although your mom is the adult and it isn't your responsibility to keep tabs on her, please make sure you do at least a weekly check in. And even ask how Bf is doing, if he's gone to therapy, how is he managing his anger etc. Show an interest on his wellbeing but let her know you just aren't comfortable being around him where he could snap at any minute.  You mom should understand. Make sure she knows you aren't asking her to choose between you and him, but that as of now you just aren't comfortable around him.", "I would say your not entirely wrong but you should still see your mom cause leaving her alone with an abuser isn't the best thing. maybe he's changed but don't believe it till you've seen proof", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Avoiding an abuser is the textbook definition of good boundaries.", "I always call her and text her as much as I can but going back there and possibly being in the middle of another argument doesn\u2019t seem fair especially when it was my moms choice to give him another chance. And I\u2019m going through enough shit already smh", "If OP is under 18 I disagree. I see a lot of posts with similar advice.\n\nOP should talk to an adult like her Mums sister and they can take on the responsibility of making sure Mum is ok. This isn't something that the OP should have to manage themselves or worry about.\n\nOP can just be friendly to their Mum and set a boundary that they dont want to be around her boyfriend. That's more than enough responsiblity.", "True, i didnt even consider that OP could be a minor", "NTA\n\nShe has normalised his behaviour in her head. If you just continued being around him too, that would be a big confirmation bias for her of him not being that bad. She now has to confront why you won't ve around him every time she wants to see you, and it's good that she must, because then maybe she'll open her eyes.", "Look\u2026 this guy is abusive. Abusers have an element of control over their victims. You need to help your mom get out of that situation\u2026. Not throw her away\u2026. That will only drive her closer to him\u2026. And push you further away. Yes, it\u2019s harder, but don\u2019t give up\u2026. She is being manipulated and abused\u2026. She needs your help.\n\nSoft YTA. You have a reason to be upset, but handle it differently", "NTA\nHe has unresolved issues. His temper makes him dangerous and abusive.\n\nYou have a right to not want to be around that.\n\nI had to deal with similar. My mom was aware she could come over and visit any time (she never did), so ling as he wasn't with her and if he showed up, police would be called on him for trespassing. She chose her toxic boyfriend, however he never managed to isolate her the way he wanted to.", "NTA if your mother wants to be abused, you don't have to watch.", "NTA. Your mom needs to understand her boyfriend\u2019s behavior is not okay & you find her acceptance difficult to understand.", "I agree with this approach.   \n\nIts definitely not a teenager or childs responsibility to be making sure her mother is safe in this situation, definitely talk to her aunt about this", "NTA. He sounds dangerous and awful.  Tell her one on one visits only.", "Jesus dude. Sounds like your mom needs you more then ever. Also YWBTA for giving this man exactly what he wants by just cutting her off. You mother isolated and without support.", "best answer", "I agree OP is NTA, but just pointing out that nobody wants to be abused. Your phrasing is victim-blaming.", "Yesss!!! 1000000% yes! Dude as someone who was in charge of their mums mental health from birth till 12 years old (i checked out cause seeing her miserable feels better than sacrificing myself to see her happy) and that sucked so much still does now tht im in charge of making sure thw adults in my fam get the punishments they deserve instead of oh ure ok u didnt mean to tell ure 7 year old u'd be happier if he was gone >:( . Op it is not our fault or our responsibility wat parents do thats their parents job all u can and SHOULD do is be civil with ure mum when she is and let he appropriate adults know like her sister otherwise not ure body not ure relationship not ure problem.", "NTA.  Your mom is in an abusive relationship.  It's time for her to re-evaluate this man.  Who could blame you for not wanting to be around him?", "nta", "Nope, NTA.  She's exposing you to this at her home?   Not good."]}
