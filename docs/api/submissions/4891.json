The apartment my SO and I used to live in, our downstairs neighbors woke me up (my SO worked overnights at the time) multiple times in the middle of the night either screaming at each other at the top of their lungs or vacuuming. One time I was woken out of a sound sleep at around 1 in the morning because of the vacuuming. Best of luck with your neighbors.", "It is right? I made a post in another sub and people were saying \"this is just apartment living, did you ever think maybe they work nights??\" And I feel like that's totally irrelevant, 3AM is an insane time for *anybody* to be doing vacuuming, and you need to have the self-awareness to realize that you have neighbors below you.", "Oh believe me I will be moving out as soon as possible. I'm only in this condo now because I went to law school and it's a great way for the GF and I to lock in our low monthly payments. Once we can afford it, we're out.", "Yeah major life lesson here. Living underneath loud people sucks so much ass.\n\nI lived in two first-floor apartments before. Neither presented this big of an issue. The neighbors were more self-aware, and the floors were more soundproof. But this apartment has been brutal.", "I'm on the fence of either reporting to management or leaving a note/knocking on their door. Honestly, I'm a little hesitant to confront them because to me, vacuuming at 2/3 AM is straight up drug-addict behavior. But I know they rent, so their landlord would be the one to get the noise complaint, and he may just sit on it.", "They're not 3rd shifters. I hear them around almost all the time during the day. They WFH.", "Once it was *this bad*. They\u2019re annoying a lot and we shake it off. They run on a treadmill indoors, have a dog that drops a loud ass plastic bone, stomp around after 11 all day, have loud sex that we can hear late at night. \n\nBut yes, this is the first time they\u2019ve vacuumed.", "No, this is far, far too reasonable. Much better to assume the neighbors are unhinged psychos than assume that maybe someone broke a glass getting a late night drink of water or something.", "What would you propose as an alternative? I'm not going to go to the police (because of the same reasons).\n\nI also really don't want to directly confront them. In no small part because vacuuming at this hour seems like insane, unhinged behavior to me.", "that's stupid...", "\u2026 dude. It\u2019s a civil infraction at most. Nobody\u2019s a criminal.

If you have issues with it you can leave", "It's possible that something insane came up that required vacuuming and furniture moving in the middle of the night. I think to go to the HOA about it after one isolated incident would be a dick move.", "Right, because not wanting to knock on someone\u2019s door at 3 am is milquetoast. That\u2019s the issue here. \n\nAlso, I posted this situation in another sub and got a lot of \u201cthis is living in an apartment, maybe they work nights, they did nothing wrong\u201d type answers.

That\u2019s the issue here.\n\nIt very much is. When I still lived in my loft apartment and had noise issues late at night (which are 100% part of apartment living lmao), I did this crazy thing where I (gasp) spoke to my neighbors while the problem was occurring! It was incredible in how it solved the issue moving forward. So sorry that such a conversation is beyond you to imagine.", "I think one of your chips is broken", "What do you mean I have deleted posts?

It is abundantly clear that vacuuming at those hours is extremely rude and unacceptable.\n\n>They could be 3rd shifters and decided they finally needed to clean up\n\nDoesn't make it ok", "As someone who works nights, yeah it sucks to not be able to clean during your usual active cycle but thems the breaks. I always worry about my normal less loud activities bothering other people. Luckily I'm on the bottom floor.", "Just the one, we were both at the end of the building. I\u2019m not a sadist, but I am petty.", "The solution to that does not involve vacuuming at 3 am if there are strangers living below you.", "Right? I don't get why the limit is \"oh, first time is fine, wait until they disturb your sleep for the 5th time.\" I think it's extremely rude and unacceptable as well, even the 1st time. If there *absolutely* is some reason why you *must* vacuum at 3AM, fine. But then don't fucking stomp around for another hour and a half and then stomp on the floors when your downstairs neighbor knock on your ceiling trying to tell you to stfu.", "Seriously. I'm honestly shocked the amount of people acting like vacuuming at 3AM is *at all* normal.\n\nAlso, the \"broken glass\" theories are ridiculous because we didn't hear any broken glass. They just decided to vacuum.\n\nBut even if I did break glass at 3AM, I would be super careful to be quiet about it. I do not understand how people lack the self-awareness to think this is OK.", "(1) they don't work nights. I hear them WFH during the day. They're at home all the time during the day, evening, and night.\n\n(2) If they did work nights, why the hell are they up at 2AM?", "It'd be one thing if it was like 10pm, right on the border. I'd probably let that go on a first offense. But 2am? No way.", "You went to a sub that specifically exists to complain about HOAs exercising their authority and were surprised that the audience didn't want to encourage an HOA to exercise their authority.", "Well first of all no need to be a dick, I was agreeing with you. And people who work nights have days off, you know? I keep the same sleep/wake schedule on my days off because my body would be destroyed otherwise.", "If it was just the vacuuming, yeah. But they were walking around and moving furniture and shit *for over an hour and a half*. If I spill something and need to vacuum, I'm going to do it quickly and then feel god awful about it if it's 3AM. Actually, I would use a broom first before a vacuum, and only vacuum if absolutely necessary.", "Agreed. I would let it go if it was all the way up until midnight honestly. I think  10PM is somewhat arbitrary. I'm not sitting here with a fucking stopwatch like some commenters seem to think I am, waiting for when the clock strikes 10:01 so I can screw them for tiptoeing to the bathroom.

My GF wants to full blown go to the HOA. And I get it. She has trouble sleeping all the time as is, and had to take a bunch of Xanax to be able to fall asleep again only to wake up at 6 AM and drive to a hospital for work in the snow. I had to wake up and take an exam. It seems incredibly lenient to give them a pass for whatever reason.\n\nThere is another twist that I forgot to add. We think the guy who lives there has a new GF. The old wife we haven't seen in like 6 months. The new girl we see around now. Maybe the actual tenant was out of town, the GF comes back late and decides to clean up before the guy gets back, and she doesn't know how noisy the building is/the rules and doesn't care because fuck it, it's not her place. Just a theory, but we're literally so confused how anyone would think this is acceptable. \n\nOr as you say, manic episode unfortunately.", "He did, right? He started commenting on my posts in the other thread too. I didn't get to see what he said here, but he's being weirdly antagonistic for what seems like 0 reason. It's honestly making me think he himself is an annoying upstairs neighbor."]}
