The apartment my SO and I used to live in, our downstairs neighbors woke me up (my SO worked overnights at the time) multiple times in the middle of the night either screaming at each other at the top of their lungs or vacuuming. One time I was woken out of a sound sleep at around 1 in the morning because of the vacuuming. Best of luck with your neighbors.", "It is right? I made a post in another sub and people were saying \"this is just apartment living, did you ever think maybe they work nights??\" And I feel like that's totally irrelevant, 3AM is an insane time for *anybody* to be doing vacuuming, and you need to have the self-awareness to realize that you have neighbors below you.", "Oh believe me I will be moving out as soon as possible. I'm only in this condo now because I went to law school and it's a great way for the GF and I to lock in our low monthly payments. Once we can afford it, we're out.", "Yeah major life lesson here. Living underneath loud people sucks so much ass.\n\nI lived in two first-floor apartments before. Neither presented this big of an issue. The neighbors were more self-aware, and the floors were more soundproof. But this apartment has been brutal.", "I'm on the fence of either reporting to management or leaving a note/knocking on their door. Honestly, I'm a little hesitant to confront them because to me, vacuuming at 2/3 AM is straight up drug-addict behavior. But I know they rent, so their landlord would be the one to get the noise complaint, and he may just sit on it.", "They're not 3rd shifters. I hear them around almost all the time during the day. They WFH.", "Once it was *this bad*. They\u2019re annoying a lot and we shake it off. They run on a treadmill indoors, have a dog that drops a loud ass plastic bone, stomp around after 11 all day, have loud sex that we can hear late at night. \n\nBut yes, this is the first time they\u2019ve vacuumed.", "No, this is far, far too reasonable. Much better to assume the neighbors are unhinged psychos than assume that maybe someone broke a glass getting a late night drink of water or something.", "What would you propose as an alternative? I'm not going to go to the police (because of the same reasons).\n\nI also really don't want to directly confront them. In no small part because vacuuming at this hour seems like insane, unhinged behavior to me.", "that's stupid...", "\u2026 dude. It\u2019s a civil infraction at most. Nobody\u2019s a criminal. But I get it, you\u2019re trying to be Extra. Have fun with that.", "Unless everyone in the building works nights, the night shift people need to work with the majority of the tenants, not the other way around.", "If you work nights and you live in a shared building like this, you wait for a day off to do your vacuuming. The other sub are just wrong.", "There\u2019s a lot of people who think if you live in an apartment, you have to put up with anything", "good stuff man, me and my Fianc\u00e9 thankfully have been blessed enough to avoid going to an apartment as i live in one now and absolutely hate it. getting married next year and cant wait for some peace!", "Complain to HOA.

It seems insane and selfish to do this.", "Not really. This is the entire existence of this sub. If you have issues with it you can leave", "It's possible that something insane came up that required vacuuming and furniture moving in the middle of the night. I think to go to the HOA about it after one isolated incident would be a dick move.", "Right, because not wanting to knock on someone\u2019s door at 3 am is milquetoast. That\u2019s the issue here. \n\nAlso, I posted this situation in another sub and got a lot of \u201cthis is living in an apartment, maybe they work nights, they did nothing wrong\u201d type answers. So clearly there\u2019s nuance here.", "Have fun with that.", "No, I said it was milquetoast to be such a coward that you wouldn't confront your neighbors. In addition to being too dumb to confront the problem directly, you also seem too dumb to read comments properly. No wonder you have so many deleted posts asking internet strangers to adjudicate every conflict in your life lmao", ">  So clearly there\u2019s nuance here.\n\nAn ironic comment from someone who assumes his neighbors are \"unhinged\" rather than accidentally making a mess at night time.\n\n>Right, because not wanting to knock on someone\u2019s door at 3 am is milquetoast. That\u2019s the issue here.\n\nIt very much is. When I still lived in my loft apartment and had noise issues late at night (which are 100% part of apartment living lmao), I did this crazy thing where I (gasp) spoke to my neighbors while the problem was occurring! It was incredible in how it solved the issue moving forward. So sorry that such a conversation is beyond you to imagine.", "I think one of your chips is broken", "What do you mean I have deleted posts?
