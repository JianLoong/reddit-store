No matter the cost doesn't mean she gets a $2.5 million dollar Cartier necklace, Taylor Swift to perform at the reception, or that it can be on Mars.  Your daughter should know that. You raised a child of privilege; she's going to need to figure it out.", "You agreed to pay for a wedding, not multiple sets of travel expenses.", "Info: Does \u201cimplicit\u201d mean, \u201cobvious to me, even though I never said it to anyone?\u201d", "NTA -I know I will be downvoted for this, but your entitled daughter is taking an advantage of your promise. She is pushing the boundary. You committed to paying for her wedding but not spending an outrageous sum of money.  \n\nYour first 2 children were reasonable adults, but your youngest is being a ridiculous brat. And you are helping pay for her honeymoon\u2026double brat.", "NTA because her siblings got weddings paid that were reasonably affordable. It\u2019s also kinda unfair towards the siblings and might create even more drama (\u201eIf she got that expensive wedding in Europe paid, I want a bigger cut of your inheritance!\u201c etc etc). \n\nBut, maybe some unsolicited advice: Why not contribute the cost that it would take to have the wedding near your place and the couple pays the rest?", "INFO:  Other than the location being a logistical challenge, are Ava's plans for the actual wedding and reception significantly more expensive than her siblings'?  Because it seems to me that you agreed to pay for the \\*wedding\\*, not anyone's transportation costs.  You should keep your promise, and her guests can decide for themselves if they want to spend the time, money, and effort to attend.  At the very least, you should chip in the larger of the two amounts you spent on your other children.\n\nAlso, I question your assertion that her plans \"would require most everyone to take a transatlantic flight, just to take another one back the day after.\"  Because who tf goes to a destination wedding and only stays for the one day?  My brother is getting married on a tropical island next year, and I don't know anyone invited who's planning to stay less than four days.  Heck, I'm probably going to spend more time there than the bride and groom to do some diving with friends.  If I got invited to a wedding in Europe, I'd use it as an excuse to take at least a week to see the country.", "NTA.  \n\nYou mentioned \"long ago\".  I'm assuming that is, 10-12+ years ago?\n\nI can 100% understand how - you never would have added this condition.  The whole idea of destination weddings - has really come about in the last 10-15 years.  \n\nThat said, saying \"whatever the cost\" seems a bit silly.  You could spend millions on a wedding if you wanted.", "NTA.  Even though you said no matter the cost, Ava is taking it a little too far. And now that you set reasonable terms, she is acting like an entitled drama queen to get her way. If she was this ultra expensive wedding in Europe, tell her you pay 50% or nothing. Even with that you are being very generous. There is no way she would consider a European wedding if she were paying for it.", "NTA. It basically like saying \u201cI\u2019ll pay for lunch.\u201d And then instead of going the places they usually do or ordering what they normally order, they decide to go to a Michelin star restaurant and ordering the most expensive looking thing on the menu because \u2018hey you didn\u2019t set limits\u2019. It\u2019s not about spoken limits, it\u2019s about common courtesy and social educate.", "NTA.\n\nYes, you did say \"no matter the cost\", but FFS, Eva should have understood that even in a promise, common sense should apply and \"no matter the cost\" still needs to be within reason. \n\nOrganizing wedding across the ocean is far beyond reason.", "Info: how *did* you imply this condition of where the wedding takes place?

You did not have conditions attached to the offer. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to be like \u201cpaying for an overseas wedding is more than I can afford, but here is what I paid towards your sibling\u2019s wedding and you can use that money how you like.\u201d", "Holy shit.  You promised a wedding.  You didn't promise transportation and a vacation.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou stipulated the conditions, she choose to go outside them. I know dad's often overlook their daughters behaviour, but she went directly against the stipulations and specifically chose one of the most expensive options she could. You aren't responsible for her trying to take advantage of you and it'd would frankly be hypocritical for you to do it for her AFTER the other's weddings. This actually sounds like it's the perfect setup for a lesson about entitlement for Ava and from what you said, she certainly needs it.   \nStop feeling guilty for not allowing yourself to be taken advantage of.", "NTA, you did not reneg you are still willing to pay for her wedding withing a certain rational limit. Picking something that cost 10x more then your siblings put together is just insane. You clearly have a lot of money but Ava should realize every one has their limits.\n\nMaybe as a compromise/fairness pay for the stupid things but let her know the surpluss cost will come out of her side of the inheritance. For the sake of fareness.\n\nBtw if the whole thing falls through and you need a good son in law let me know, I got decent Reddit Karma XD", "NTA. Offer to give her whatever the higher cost of the other two weddings was, adjusted for inflation,  and they can pay any difference.  You can't get fairer than that.\n\nI think she chose this only because you are paying, and she's trying to milk you for as much as she can.  It's amazing how people's \"must haves\" change when it's their dime.\n\nAnd if they still choose Europe, let them know that her gifts will be far fewer and cheaper.  Nothing drops the price of a gift than when you have to spend $5000 just to attend.  That's not a factor when you're not trying to include the cost of the gifts to offset wedding costs.", "NTA your daughter is", "ESH.   This is the problem: \"And while I didn't explicitly state it, the one implicit condition I had was that the wedding be organized close to our city, where we all live. For no particular reason other than logistics.\"  If you did not verbalize it, you expect your kids to be mind readers.  I do agree that what she wants would make it more difficult, but you can offer a compromise: the money for everyone to fly over and stay there will detract from what you would be a part of the wedding and the amount will be limited to what was spent on the others (look at how much you spent on the other two).  Just because you think it is ridiculous, doesn't mean everyone does.  Have you thought that maybe she is trying to get everyone to go somewhere fun and have a real experience in another country, not just go to a boring wedding?", "Let's see you paid for 2 of the 3 and set an unspoken condition on you paying, no wonder she's mad at you.

Why didn't you say I'll pay for your wedding.  Also how old was she when you made this promise?  You should have known better as an adult to make such a promise with zero conditions.\n\nNevertheless, why not agree to pay for the wedding only and not the travel arrangements?  It should be about the same cost shouldn't it?  It will most likely be a smaller wedding to as most people can't attend a destination wedding", "Your wife meant well, no doubt- but this was not a fair ask unless you are exceptionally well-off. She was not thinking of the likelihood of one of your children taking advantage of this promise- because clearly there were more pressing things going on at the time. Your wife wanted to be able to know her babies were going to be taken care of in this way. \n\nInstead of paying for the wedding in full- could you give her a budget that is in line with what you paid for the other two weddings? You would be paying for the wedding but the couple can pay for the airfare and accommodations? \n\nI\u2019m going to go with NAH.", "You aren't reneging. You set terms. They aren't terms Ava wishes to comply with. She pays for her own wedding because she doesn't like your terms. No biggie IMO.

You didn't give them any conditions to work within and an \"unspoken agreement\" usually means one person made up a rule and the other person has no idea. \n\nYou made up an unknown rule. If you don't want to pay for all of that, it's your money and you don't have to... But this doesn't look great for you. You may have to find a compromise on this one where you pay for venue and arrangements and everything... But maybe not fly everyone over. Or only cover a few people, but not all of them. You both just gotta figure it out.", "> I made my children a promise: That I would pay for their wedding no matter the cost.\n\n> I told Ava I am not willing to pay for such an expensive wedding\n\n> I can afford it\n\nYTA\n\nit\u2019s pretty black and white in your own words", "Your only stipulation was location, she can't change the terms of the agreement and except full payment. Maybe compromise, as a wedding that far away will be extremely expensive unless she limits guests or gets them to pay for their own travel there. \n\nIf she has it closer she can have everyone she wants and the wedding she wants. \n\nI'd say I'll contribute if it's in Europe and Pay for it all if its closer to home", "Dude, we know the golden children. I don't know if you're an asshole or not. You better figure something out or you may end up being the father of just 2. I don't know you or anything about your family so can't make a determination but get this fixed.", "NTA- There might be a simple solution. You said you would \u201cpay for the wedding\u201d. Her interpretation is crazy. What if you do the same, but opposite? Ask her how much does the church with priest/whomever cost, and her dress, hair & makeup for herself (only). Write her a check for that. A wedding is the ceremony. Everything else is fluff. You said wedding, not \u201cparty\u201d right? There you go! Might put things in perspective.", "NTA. Your daughter is naive and self-centered if she can't see the difference between the cost of a wedding in your home region and one in Europe.

Even when you promised a wedding no matter the costs and she didn\u2019t grasp that it had to be local, asking to pay for a wedding abroad is very entitled and unreasonable.", "Can you just give her what you spent on the other weddings and tell her she is on the hook for anything over that amount? \n\nNTA - she sounds spoiled and trying to squeeze anything out of you. Plus more than half the people invited probably wouldnt go either. You make promises but they always have some kind of stipulation not straight up I want this so I get this because you promised. Hold your ground dad.", "NTA. Offer to give her the same amount you gave for the other two wedding and she can pay the difference if she wants to get married in Europe.", "NTA match the amount you gave to your other children & let her work out the details.

Okay no matter how not implied it was, the cheek of asking for a destination wedding be paid for. It\u2019s like if someone offers to pay for supper, the proper thing is to not go to an out of budget restaurant and order expensive food. The best thing would be to calculate costs of the other weddings and offer her the highest amount of the two.", "NTA, but why not pay if you can afford it? Even talking to them about paying what would be normal for a \u201ccloser\u201d wedding could be an option, and for them to pay the rest. Your problem seems to be with her desire to have a wedding overseas rather than with the money itself.", "YTA - your promise was a promise. Nowhere did you state that the wedding had to follow stipulations. I was considering E S H but to be honest, your daughter had no reason to think you wouldn\u2019t pay for it. She\u2019s right, you are going back on your word. You did say no matter the cost, and you didn\u2019t outline any rules for her.

That said, even with added conditions, it\u2019s still a very generous offer, and she\u2019s being a bit unreasonable over a free wedding.", "YTA for making a ridiculous promise (no matter the cost!)\n\nBut, is it really going to be that much more than her siblings? People pay their own expenses to attend a destination wedding.   If you\u2019re paying for the actual event, whether it\u2019s in your city or one in Italy, is it comparable enough? Assuming you\u2019re physically able to travel and attend, I\u2019d go for it and enjoy a lovely event in Europe.  It\u2019ll likely be significantly smaller as not as many people will travel, but it could end up being a beautiful intimate event.\n\nAnd anyone who chooses to attend will make the travel arrangements that work for them - probably extending their trip and not just turning around to fly home.", "INFO: Is she expecting you to pay for the flights of everyone to get to the wedding, or just for the wedding itself, with the guests still paying for their own flights?\n\nIf it's the latter then I can \\*sort of\\* get it - in that case I imagine that the cost wouldn't be too different for you, since a wedding is a wedding regardless of the location. If the cost was in the same ballpark to the other's weddings, and you're refusing because of the logistics (and cost to everyone else), then it could come across as you setting conditions on how they plan the wedding.\n\nIf they are expecting you to pay for the cost of everyone's transatlantic flights then it's definitely ridiculous. Perhaps you could have been clearer in your original promise, set a specific budget or something, but those sort of promises should be taken with gratitude and care to put the money to good use, rather than a challenge to have the most expensive wedding possible.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think destination weddings are a ridiculous idea regardless, and if they (well, you) aren't covering everyone's flight/travel costs then it's incredibly selfish to put that expectation on guests. But I guess that is besides the point, and is the sort of thing that might be an unfair condition to put on paying for the wedding based on your preference, if the cost is similar.", "YTA It's your money, do whatever you want but don't pretend there were hidden conditions.", "YTA.

Telling them out loud beforehand doesn't really serve much purpose in my opinion. \n\nThat said, your daughter clearly knows she's taking the mickey.

That is more than fair.\n\nESH.", "The wife had nothing to do with it. OP made the promise to his kids *after* his wife died.", "Reneging = renegotiating.

If I tell my friend I'll buy them dinner, I am not the asshole for refusing to buy them three steaks and five desserts. Common sense and decency is a thing. I can see ESH, although I think it's NTA, but YTA? Unless OP is a multi millionaire and hasn't told us, he can't afford such an expensive wedding. Just like it wouldn't make him an asshole to not pay for a dress or wedding jewelry that's 50k itself. Common sense.", "Yeah. The title pretty much says it all. These three lines cement the truth.", "Oh just realised you said you didn't state it. YTA pay for the wedding maybe not all the guests getting there", "Within reason is an unspoken statement always\n\nIf she wanted to hire mariah carey to sing it would be equally outrageous a demand", "He said close to the city he lives in. Europe must be far, far away?", "But had 1 term to adhere to.", "Is that the purpose of the offer? He gets to control the guest list? What if the daughter doesn\u2019t like Aunt Milly and wouldn\u2019t want her there.  What if she didn\u2019t want to invite any extended family at all.  \n\nIf I were the daughter I\u2019d have assumed the offer was genuine as stated - he\u2019d pay for the wedding.  Period.  If the couple can plan what they want in the same price range as the siblings, I think OP should let them go for it.", "Hi there OP, my name is Paul and I\u2019m an American/Dutch destination wedding planner in Italy. I agree with u/Kingsdaughter613. Ava could pay for the flights and hotels herself. However, a lot of couples let guests pay for the transport and accommodation themselves. A destination wedding in Europa doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be more expensive than one close by (in terms of direct wedding costs).", "If he paid for 300 people in a city venue, that very well could be more\n$$$ than 30 people for an evening in Italy.  People pay their own expenses to destination weddings.  Even paying for his own travel, he could very well come out ahead.", "I guess without more info I\u2019m not sure that Europe is that much more expensive (or even more expensive at all!) OP doesn\u2019t have to pay travel expenses.  If he\u2019s paying for a small intimate wedding in Europe with the group that wants to attend the destination wedding, that could be cheaper than 3x as many people locally.\n\nOP says it\u2019s rIdiculous to have to fly to Europe for his daughters wedding, implying his issue is personally traveling.", "Reneging does not mean renegotiating.  Those are two different words.\n\nReneging means going back on / failing to keep a promise.", "1 term that according to OP was never explicitly mentioned", "But he didn't actually tell his kids that when he made his promise...", ">People pay their own expenses to destination weddings.\n\nThat depends on the people hosting. A fair amount of people I know have had destination weddings with the majority of the travel expenses being the responsibility of those hosting.", "Usually destination weddings are greater cost, and that's implied here.  Otherwise why do you think he doesn't want to pay for it and made this post?", "Right you are, thanks for educating me.", "Yeah, I just realised that I read that wrong.", "True, you could pay. But it\u2019s not required.  And OP could easily tell her that.  He\u2019ll pay for the event but not anyone\u2019s travel.  He likely didn\u2019t pay for everyone to get to the Ranch or for anyone not local to get to their city.", "It\u2019s not too clear what his issue is.  He says it\u2019s ridiculous to have to fly to Europe to see his daughters wedding, implying his issue may be personally traveling. He says he doesn\u2019t want guests to have to take a transatlantic flight - but that would be their choice when they decided if they wanted to attend or not.  \n\nOr maybe he\u2019s considering the cost of paying for everyone\u2019s travel.  Which would be crazy.  But if he didn\u2019t do that? And just paid for an actual event? Might be very doable.\n\nWho knows.  Maybe his daughter wants to spend 5x what her siblings did and lost her mind when he pushed back.  Or maybe he\u2019s just salty about getting on a plane.  \n\nSeems like too many things are \u201cimplied\u201d and he needs to have more explicit communication with everyone in his life!\n\nEta:  I\u2019ve been to destination weddings that were amazing and fun! And much much cheaper than my local 300 person wedding.  Because it was 30-40 people and we all paid for our own travel."]}
