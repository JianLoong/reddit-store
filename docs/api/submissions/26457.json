Your presence is the gift- it's not unheard of to ask people to pay for their own travel expenses but there is usually an unwritten agreement that due to the extra expenses, the married couple doesn't get a wedding gift.\n2. The married couple can't expect to have as many people attend. Sometimes, this is intentional to shorten the guest list.
