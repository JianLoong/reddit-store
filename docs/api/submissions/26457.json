Your presence is the gift- it's not unheard of to ask people to pay for their own travel expenses but there is usually an unwritten agreement that due to the extra expenses, the married couple doesn't get a wedding gift.\n2. The married couple can't expect to have as many people attend. Sometimes, this is intentional to shorten the guest list.

So we\u2019ll have the wedding where we are now, but i\u2019ve sadly had to accept that many many people from my side (even my parents maybe) will not be able to attend! And it sucks, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s selfish of me to want my family there! Id never berate them for it though!", "No, don't chalk it up to that. I hate that excuse, it's BS and makes people think it's ok to be ridiculous, \"bEcAuSe iM gEtTiNg MaRrIeD.\" It's *not* normal, we just hear more of those stories because nobody takes to the internet to say, \"I went to a wedding and the couple were totally normal rational people\" because *that's* what is expected.", "You forgot the \"/s\"", ">You are a total AH. How much could it possibly set you back?\n\n\nSpeaking as Op's wallet, are we? \n\n>In the scheme of things it would have little to no impact on your savings for a down payment. \n\n\nAgain, you know Op's financial situation??? \n\n\n>Just do it and appreciate the vacation.\n\n\nOp cannot afford it. Just help her? Please, just do it", "Agree. My husband and I did manage to do a combo wedding / vacation last year, thanks to the sensible bride and groom 1) picking a good spot during decent weather, and 2) not overdoing it with the wedding activities (which were all in the evenings). We were at Lake Powell so visited Antelope Canyon, some other cool sites in and around the Navajo Nation, and drove to the Grand Canyon on our way back to the airport (Las Vegas). \n\nNo one ever, ever suggested to us that we were under any obligation to attend!", "Hence my putting it in quotations. I'm not one of those people who enjoys tropical destinations for vacations so there's no way I'd agree to go to one of these for anyone except my closest friends and family. And even then I'm not blowing my savings for it, I'd only go if it was affordable.", "Plus, lots of people do not wish for their vacation to be with their whole extended family", "Not really. Unless you are in the wedding and have to go to the rehearsal, your only obligation is to show up to the wedding itself. I moved to Colorado after college but most of my friends remained in EST. We\u2019ve turned every wedding we\u2019ve gone to into a mini-vacation. We used the weddings as an excuse to tack on a vacation. \n\nIt\u2019s sort of like how my wife bought tickets to a Taylor Swift concert in Europe next summer. The only obligation we have to be at that venue for the show. After that, we can go wherever we want. Weddings are the same way and you can easily make it a vacation.", "Most times I have had maybe 2 days dedicated to the wedding and the rest of the week was my own.", "Some people seem to think having a destination wedding gives them the right to spend other people's money. Yeah, big nope.", "FYI, paying for everything still does not obligate anyone to come", "You don't know what you are talking about. I have never had the bridal party pay for a destination wedding travel or accommodations. It is looked at as the guests pay for whatever they would if the took a vacation, it is the proper way. You can google it if you don't believe me instead of making things up.", "Same. We made our wedding all about a giant beach house with room for everyone because a lot of family bought plane tickets and used their PTO to come out. So we were trying to get people to come without a big financial burden and throw in a little vacation at the same time. The actual wedding was pretty chill; we just wanted everyone together. We wouldn't have been chuffed about anyone declining. It boils down to expectations and communication.", "And that regardless of the reason it's not something you can blame them for (unless perhaps they said they could go before you booked everything). \n\nSometimes it's money, sometimes it's availability. Sometimes you have sick family you want to be around for in case the worst happens. Sometimes you just don't want your vacation days going to something you barely want to go to in the first place. The point is you need no excuse, and anyone hosting such a wedding has to understand that.", "You basically end up paying to be bored. At least that was my experience. \n\nIf I\u2019m going to have to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars and give up at least a weekend, it\u2019s going to be for an event and destination of my choosing.\n\nFor my husband and my wedding (second for each of us) we ended up with three friends and my kid at the courthouse, and a picnic and water balloon fight in the park after. Between two sets of divorced parents who were out of state or international, and couldn\u2019t be around each other, we just decided not to stress on wedding planning, or subject others to a destination thing.", "It probably depends on the family. In our culture, the parents usually pay for the wedding so it would not be expected for us to have paid for them. In fact, my dad was super relieved when I told him I didn't want a traditional wedding and just wanted to elope / have a destination wedding. It ended up being much cheaper and easier on him than any of my cousins weddings LOL!", "That is the best response as far as what to say to the people texting bs based on sister\u2019s lies.", "I am happy enough to make myself look stupid and throw in a \u201cAww, so nice of you to say you want me to be there. Thank you for your contribution. What? You are not offering to pay? But Auntie Bess did. Yes, she did. And cousin Pete called too. Well, of course. Why would they call if not to offer help? I am glad you offer to help to. Oh, you don\u2019t? Then why are you calling? What? I don\u2019t understand. What? What? I am confused. Well, I\u2019ll hang up now, you are giving me a headache\u201d. \u201cOh, hi, aunt Bessy. Yes, you did offer to pay. Oh, you\u2019re not? Oh, well, thanks for trying. I understand it is too expensive. Bye\u201d", "Pay thousands of dollars for a party that might last 12 hours or so (with all the stress that accompanies traveling plus sister\u2019s attitude) or pay for a long term investment that is also a place to live? \n\nI don\u2019t know how OP will ever choose, this one\u2019s pretty tough /s", "This right here. A one night event vs. the future. I know which one I\u2019d do.", "Then the invites go out to the B list, the C list, until any random old friend gets to be invited", "Yes, I've seen some of the destination wedding packages where it said \"Book X number of guests accomodations through us (at full price) and the Basic Wedding Package is free\".", "Oh I didn\u2019t even think of that\u2026 if the bride tries that nonsense then she\u2019s the biggest asshole I\u2019ve seen in a long time.", "My son is getting married next week and his fiancee (both late 20s) is a darling.  They are having the ceremony in the town where they grew up, even though they live across the country now, so they have to travel but family (including handicapped relatives) don\u2019t.  They are paying for it themselves; their venue is a city park; they are getting cake and flowers from Sam\u2019s; they are treating it as a happy occasion for us to celebrate their marriage; we have no bizarre clothes rules.  I would be appalled if they pulled crazy stunts like I keep seeing now.  (BTW, I\u2019m not going to wear a white wedding dress like the JustnoMIL mothers of grooms seem to do.  So everyone should be happy.)", "Maybe you could set up a live stream so those that can't afford to attend can still watch and support remotely, and then celebrate with them when you go back to visit", "so, you would think, \" why would someone voluntarily create this situation ?\"", "Agreed but in either scenario, it was wild OP expected those costs to be covered. That was more my point.", "No, it isn\u2019t. If my sister was planning her wedding and it was a destination one, I\u2019d figure out a way to pay for myself to get there because 1. I love her so much 2. I am capable of working over time, getting a 2nd job for awhile, or sell shit I don\u2019t need anymore online. Maybe don\u2019t suck and invest some money that you can collect interest on to pay for the trip. All the people hating on my comments, do not understand how to correctly invest their money and how to save properly.", "Sure, if I can come too. \n\nThink about it dude.", "Compound that with babysitting needs if there are children involved and it is child free, as many destination weddings are.", "Same!! I\u2019m not a sit around on the beach all day type of person.", "All of my friends that do destination weddings do them because they DON'T want a lot of people. It's almost more of an elopement. They only want parents (and maybe siblings). Having a destination wedding where you expect everyone (aunts, uncles, cousins... on both bride and grooms side) to travel just seems so strange to me.", "I mean, nothing is perfect. I had our wedding locally but it meant 90% of my extended family couldn\u2019t come because of the distance and cost involved. We streamed the ceremony and it was such a hit and it made me so happy to go back and see the comments and emails later\u2026still a tiny sore spot in my heart that I couldn\u2019t win the lottery and have the whole family together for the first time in over a decade. Maybe I\u2019ll win eventually and we can do a big reunion then!", "I didn\u2019t have a destinaron wedding, more like I was marrying my wife across the Country in her home Town, what we did was make a smaller \"gonna wed\" party in my Town a month before for the people that wanted to be but couldnt, that was a blast, one friend lending her cabin as venue, a couple of music friends bringing their equipment and playing some music, people bringing different dishes and the usual festive drinker with a box full of beer to share, we were expecting to make a small party chipping in the honeymoon money a little, and ended with a free medium party with more food than necesary and lots of smiles every where", "I had a destination wedding, domestic US. We had a 50% acceptance rate, and there were some who didn't come that we wanted to see, and some who surprised us and attended. Lookong back nesrly a decade later, I would not do it differently. We had a blast and it was a memorable event for everyone who joined us.", "Exactly. Was I bummed that my brothers didn't come to my wedding abroad (not destination, just an immigrant), even though I would pay for everything? Yeah. But I understand why they didn't want to fly overseas with babies under 2 years old!", ">You don't know what you are talking about. I have never had the bridal party pay for a destination wedding travel or accommodations.\n\nYou are completely missing the point.  Literally no one said the brid~~g~~e and groom have to pay.  But not everyone wants to spend $1,000s to go to someone else's wedding in another country they may not even want to visit.  The POINT is that the bride and groom don't get to bitch when people opt out - ***especially*** if they expect everyone else to foot the bill.", "Then the bridal party can\u2019t be upset because someone isn\u2019t coming. If there is no money available then she can cry me a river but the money is just not there. Definitely NTA.", "It doesn\u2019t matter what google says. I would jump on that bandwagon for a new rule as well because most of these destination weddings are above normal people\u2019s means.", "However, since there is a bigger outlay of expenses, bride and groom should consider that it could be a financial hardship for some people and understand when they decline.", "LOL, my family would definitely be like that to me if I hadn't set the precedent early on that any of that toxic BS coming my way was going to result in a swift cutting off from me, and then I followed through on every single boundary I ever set. I have very little family left that I speak to but I am a thousand times happier than the lot of them combined so it doesn't bother me in the slightest!", "Maybe it\u2019s actually a real thing, but I often start to think a post is fake when I see \u201cextended family has been blowing up my phone\u201d because it\u2019s such a common trope and seems so unlike real people behavior.", "Yes, I am always surprised and how many people poke their noses into someone else's decision and give unsolicited advice.", "Seriously.

Buh-bye, sis!", "I just like to answer \u201cokay\u201d when people get like that. It doesn\u2019t confirm or deny anything. It just acknowledges that they said something.", "HAHAHAHAHA too bad that wouldn't actually work....", "oh right, how dare someone move away to chase their dreams!? is that not allowed anymore? \nI wanted to go to college to pursue a path I couldn\u2019t have pursued in my home country, and I was deeply unhappy there, and I happened to then meet my boyfriend, and we\u2019re together now and for the the foreseeable future.

But even if it is somewhere in the Caribbean, depending on where the bride chose, it could be incredibly expensive.", "Is it regulated in the US I think 5 weeks is the minimum legal requirement in the UK so 25days if you work 5 days a week or equivalent number of hours if you work odd length days plus bank holidays often (so my basic was 33 days but 8 of them are holidays Christmas etc, when I went down to part time I get all monday holidays back to use but only after they occur). Then I get up to 10days extra for long service, I'm currently at 6 additional days. I mean I still go through them but my husband always had to take 3 weeks off in the last quarter to use them up!", "Same, plus I don't drink or eat meat so most resorts are worse than home.", "What an awesome idea!!!!  Streaming it is perfect!!!", "Streaming is a kindly thought and would work IF OP's sister  was having a hissy fit because OP won't be there for her \"special day.\" I'll lay you long odds that it isn't that. She's having a hissy fit because the wedding resort requires X many people to stay there for a discount. Perhaps even a \"free\" wedding. X-1 means everything is full price. That's what she means about OP \"not paying their share.\"", "Man do I ever feel this! I was a COVID bride. The first guests we cut were those who would have significant travel. We ended up only being allowed 10 guests and streamed it to everyone else. At some point we plan to build a home and invite everyone out for a housewarming/vow renewal.", "I was thinking this\u2026.maybe OP should offer to host a streaming party to ensure sister knows she wants to be involved but actually can\u2019t be there.

My friend threw a huge party the next time they visited her so that all the people who couldn't make it because of distance were introduced to the new husband.

This was 20 some years ago so streaming wasn't possible, but they did the wedding in their currentstate and and then small lovely parties in both of their home states.", "Occasionally my extended family will stir up drama and I just decline to get involved. My mom isn't nearly as prone to drama as her family but every now and then I have to firmly pull her back and remind her nobody wins in these things, and point out that her family members are being jerks. On the rare occasion I get brought into these dramas, I just don't reply to calls or texts until they move on. I'm sorry Aunt Nosypants doesn't like tattoos and I got another one but I'm not going to be lectured about it by my own parents, let alone her.", "True true.

And my goodness the drama her family can create out of the thinnest of air.", "Same", "In the US, PTO is often pathetic or non-existent. I get 12 days per year and work full time. We also only have the major holidays off and don't follow the federal holiday calendar.
