He's crazed from grief. If he tries to take you to court just show when your car got chipped. NTA", "Even if it was his cat, it doesn't matter, it is now yours. He didn't chip it and he owned it for less than a year, you owned it for 4. It is now yours.", "I don't know how things work where you live, but here when cats first get vaccinated the vet gives us a small notebook/card thingy where all the vaccinations are recorded with the date, the vet office's stamp and the vet's autograph. \n\nAlso with the microchip, you can see the date when you registered it with your info.\n\nIf anything else fails, you have pictures of your cat from four years ago. \n\nOf course you're NTA for not giving your cat to some rando.", "NTA. Sometimes people deal with grief in weird ways.", "NTA. I took in a kitten from my mom's neighbor and didn't look back. They didn't come looking for her for months. She was my little Buddy and I made sure she had a great life. She passed after 8 years together from cancer, but oh, those 8 years were full of love, treats, and good memories. Wouldn't trade that for anything", "You are NTA.\n\nStop feeling bad.", "One of my friends has two tuxedo cats that used to be identical - until one put on weight (yes, they're making sure she's healthy) while the other stayed slender. They even have identical markings on their chins. Now I can tell them apart!", "Thank God I am not the only one thinking about this. Someone you do not know, that could be on heavy drugs or have some kind of crazy mind sickness, bangs on  your door and the first thing you do in open the door?  He could have robe you, rape you, kill you, and a dozen more things I can imagine. Has it ever crossed your mind HE WAS CRAZY AND HAD NO SISTER AND MISSED NO CAT AT ALL???  What on earth were you thinking?", "Has it ever crossed your mind HE WAS CRAZY AND HAD NO SISTER AND NO LOST CAT AT ALL??? What on earth were you thinking? He could have robe you, rape you, kill you, and a dozen more things I can imagine. Allways call the cops !!!!!!!!!", "NTA it's not the same cat while you empathize for him you don't need to give up your cat to please him. The man can attempt court and yes your vet records would definitely be kept so it probably wouldn't even make it. If your stressed about it call the vet and get the records to have on hand to ease your mind. Go on about life.", "NTA...\n\nMy concern is that this is a scam. See cat in window, throw sob story out, victim somehow gets roped into paying for their own cat saying something like \"maybe I'll feel better if I sold it to you instead of you stealing it\" once the pet owner is clearly so overwhelmed by the encounter that they'll likely agree to anything to end the experience... Preying on fear and confusion. \n\nI also lived in a city where people throwing themselves against NON MOVING busses was a regular thing... So... Yeah. I don't trust this kind of thing", "ESH. This man is clearly unstable, but the ESH is for even considering giving your cat to an unstable temperamental man, just because it looks like his sister\u2019s cat. The time doesn\u2019t even match up. He doesn\u2019t care about the cat at all, can\u2019t even see that they\u2019re different. I\u2019ve had more than one Orange cat and black cat. You can easily tell your own cat apart.", "How dare you", "Why would you you feel guilty? It's your cat and he's obviously wrong.", "Nta\u2026. I hope you cat is microchipped you did everything you were legally required to (in my country) you took cat to vets no microchip you posted posters etc if no one claims the cat within 7 working days then the cat is abandoned and legally a stray and you are allowed to keep it plus you\u2019ve had the cat 4 years not two it\u2019s not the same cat", "NTA - This is your fur baby, and this person is wrong, either mistakenly or maliciously.", "NTA.  Mistaken identity happens.  If you chipped the cat in the first year then I assume the chip has a date on it and that will make it easy.  Rather than going to court, maybe ask your vet to print something up with all the cat's check ups whatever and have it on-hand in case he comes back.", "NTA - anybody with any dealings with cats knows NOBODY OWNS A CAT.\n\nCats choose where they will or will not live.  This cat found better digs", "Nta. You had it before he claimed it went missing\u2026 2 whole years before", "So you\u2019re not going to give your cat to a random stranger who happened to lose a completely different cat? I think that\u2019s a pretty straightforward NTA", "The op must not let her cat outside because she\u2019s in danger of being stolen."]}
