It sucks for the guy, but he is projecting his unhealed grief wound onto someone else in a kind of paranoid/delusional way. You aren't ever going to be able to control what someone else is thinking, so while it's very sweet that you have sympathy for him, not giving into his delusions does not make you an AH.", "NTA. It's not the same cat. That's all there is to it.", "NTA - You put up posters and checked if the cat was chipped.  Plus his dates don't even remotely line up.  4 vs 2 years!!  I'd call the cops is he shows up again and make sure you don't let that cat outside.  Vets for sure have records to back you up.", "I hope you're not really worried about this, OP, but just in case, no, you're NTA for not giving YOUR cat to someone who clearly isn't well, and believes that your cat is a different cat.  If you're telling us the whole story, there is literally no way this man's missing cat could be the cat you have, based on timeline alone.  Markings, photos, etc don't matter.", "NTA. Tuxedo cats are extremely common. I read this while sitting with mine napping in my lap.", "N even remotely TA. He's clearly wrong, possibly mentally ill, and you did what you could to find the owner anyway. The vet would certainly have records, of the chipping if nothing else.", "NTA\n\npoor man is obviously upset but you will have the implant date showing on your microchip paperwork to prove she has been with you 4 years.", "Okay, so I wanna make this clear.\nYou found the cat four years ago, and two days ago when this person had marched over to your house and claimed that \"their\" pet had gone missing *two years* after you had adopted said cat as if they were slow and realized that \"their\" pet was missing a long time after you took the cat with you. You could tell the person was trying to unjustly take your pet right away from the incorrect times of events, although he had photos that matched your cat, it's likely a coincidence. You're NTA here, the pissed-off person is.\n\n\n\n\nThis is my first Reddit comment, so I hope I did well with it.", "NTA! And vets do keep records. Hell, the chip company has the record of when you had the cat chipped. \n\nDo not, under any circumstance, give your cat away!", "First and foremost.  This is not someone else's cat.  Most Tuxedos look the same at some point in their lives.  It's your cat.  So protect yourself and your pet.\n\nStep 1) take your cat to the vet immediately and have it microchipped\n\nStep 2) take the cat to a friends house or a family member's house and leave it there for a little while\n\nStep 3) install motion activated security cameras all around your home and inside your home.  That way if this person breaks in, you can show the footage to the police \n\nStep 4) file a complaint with the police.  You are just starting a paper trail. Tell them a man confronted you angrily...beating on your door and accusing you of stealing his cat 2 years ago when you have had your cat for 4 years.  Let them know you have cameras now and you will give them any video if he returns, but you want to start the paper trail now\n\nStep 5) Get pepper spray and never go out without it.  If the crazy guy comes back, spray the shit out of him and then call the police\n\nNTA", "NTA. You found a kitten, made attempts to find its owners, and took care of it for years. Then, when this person arrived in your lives, you heard him out and tried to reason with him. From the timelines you describe, it seems like the cat he lost is a different one. I would think you've done everything a decent person would do until now. \n\nI'm hoping this person was overwhelmed and in grief  and doesn't truly mean to take you to court. Good luck!", "NTA.  Too bad for the guy, but it's not his cat.", "NTA.  Even if the cat can be proven to be the same cat they lost, it has been years.  Not days, years.  And, you did your due diligence of checking that it was no one else's kitten.  As for legally, they would have to prove that it was their cat. \n\nFor feeling bad, how do you think the cat would feel?  You have had them since they were a kitten and suddenly you give them to a total stranger?  And you don't know this guy.  He could be some mentally unstable person who likes to torture animals.  So you would be willing to give a cat, that you raised from a kitten, to someone who may torture it?", "NTA. it\u2019s not the same cat and I hope you don\u2019t need to go through the courts to prove it.", "NTA\n\nUnless he has physical evidence, such as receipts/ documentation, that he purchased/adopted this cat, there's no way it will go to court. Do not worry about it, and definitely DO NOT give him YOUR cat. I'm willing to bet this is a scam, and he's using threats and a sob story to take your animal. If, strangely, it does go to court, you have more than enough evidence to prove he's full of shit.", "NTA. I wouldn't worry about this: on the off chance he actually *does* take you to court a few of the pictures you have pre-dating the loss of his cat along with a print out from your vet showing all of your cat's appointments (they'll be able to provide you with this easily) will be all that is needed to get it thrown at. \n\nI know many jurisdictions treat cats as different from \"normal\" personal property due to their independent nature: the will of the cat moving on to a new owner supersedes the original \"owners\" claim.", "I'm sure you and the vets have records to prove everything. You must have pictures on your phone with timestamps, credit card statements, etc. It's going to be fine.\n\nYour cat loves you. Of course you shouldn't rehome him just to satisfy some sad man.", "NTA, obviously. \n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty, OP. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong or bad. Although this guy may be in some emotional anguish, he has mistakenly pointed that ire towards you and is unwilling to listen to rhyme or reason. I highly doubt he\u2019s taking you to court. \n\nIf he returns, and you\u2019re feeling *kind and nice enough to put his mind at ease*, maybe you could show him paperwork from the vet visits all those years ago. However, don\u2019t feel inclined to. This is a stranger and even if his behavior is *somewhat* explainable in your eyes, you don\u2019t owe him anything. You already tried to be cordial and explain the facts to him once.", "the vet records will be all that court will care about, if it gets to that. NTA.", "NTA- if you microchipped the cat, then that date will be in their database.  That is all the proof you need. And yes call your vet and ask for copies of when your cat was chipped. (they should have that in their system).  Also any photos you have is fine too.", "NTA There is a cat running around my neighborhood that looks exactly like my indoor cat. So many times I have been startled thinking she got out of the house somehow. Cats look alike, it's just how it is.", "Get the vet records. YNTA and he might be not dealing well with his grief. Be careful, and fight for YOUR kitterkat.", "NTA\n\nBy no means give up your cat", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
