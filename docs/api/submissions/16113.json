Blame game is not going to help either of you, trying to tell her how she\u2019s wrong will only distance her from you.\n\nShe also seems to have unhealthy ideas about partnership, so I would try to focus on that.

If she can't do chores like before he is \"helping\", they both work and he even has a side business.\n\nShe's being rude, negative, and nasty to him. There's no reason to ever be abusive to your partner. I'm not an expert but I've heard you get more sensitive to smells and other stimuli while pregnant. So what she smells, he might not, it might not be that he's ignoring things it's just that he doesn't notice like she does.\n\nYou don't make demands of someone you love the way she is doing nor do you talk down to them.", "uh shes only three months she can get off her lazy ass and clean the toilet if it smells. it\u2019s called \u2728adulting\u2728", "She's 3 months pregnant,  not handicapped jfc!", "She said she regrets marrying him because he\u2019s western so isn\u2019t willing to put up with being treated like shit (her words, not mine, according to OP). But it\u2019s thisnurselovesblood who is trashy for suggesting this kind of attitude isn\u2019t conducive to a healthy relationship? Pregnancy or not no one should be forced to remain in an abusive relationship and that comments is pretty suggestive to me of her mentality towards this guy", "Would you not be rethinking it if your spouse was like this?", "Is it more or less trashy than treating your spouse like crap?", "So what, you just be abused because she happens to be pregnant? Pregnancy isn\u2019t some magical plot armor that should protect you from the consequences of your behavior", "What's trashy is this pregnant woman justifying her toxic behaviour towards her husband as a culture thing. She literally belittle him and constantly tells him he's not enough as OP says in his post. Is that acceptable? Or her being pregnant enough to treat her husband like shit all the time?", "Yes, this is a fixable thing. It\u2019s a communication issue and an unlearning of toxic behaviour. This is not one of those times where we should reach to divorce IMO.", "Uh right someone saying they regret marrying their partner because they want to be able to abuse them without pushback is just normal pregnancy hormones", "She literally said she regrets marrying him because he's Western.  He'll be Western even when she's not pregnant.", "This is how I react to that comment lmao", "No I would have said the same regardless of race", "But didn't you know that once a woman becomes pregnant, she's severely disabled? /S.", "At the start of pregnancy, especially if you're sick, smells can be unbearable. She is an adult, but so is he. It would be much much easier for him to clean the toilet, and it's not really \"helping\" to clean the toilet in your own house.\n\nShe sounds like she's being rude and unpleasant, but he sounds a bit clueless tbh and probably pretty frustrating to live with.", "It\u2019s also quite racist towards Asian people", "he says he cleans. i\u2019m taking him at his word."]}
