Where would I put this clock?\n\nI just check my first aid kit when I need something only to find out it's missing, like nature intended.", "Mine also has a hidden keyhole when needed no power required.", "That doesn't help. The lock is powered by the keypad.\n\nI have one. I think about that, too. One day it will die and I'll be stranded.", "Um....you wanna elaborate on that?", "I kind of feel that if someone broke in through the garage door, they are now pretty committed and will probably break in through the door to the house?", "I guess it depends on your neighborhood AND on your garage door opener. Most garage doors LOCK and you canNOT raise it without an opener. \n\nGood grief, do none of you have actual locked garage doors that require an opener to get in?", "> OP is right to be confused their wife won\u2019t carry a house key. \n\nParticularly when she's *already carrying car keys*. It doesn't functionally change anything to have 1-3 more keys on your keychain.", "It's almost as if those rings are designed specifically for keys. They should be called 'keyrings'.", "Don\u2019t look at me, I have my front door, back door, (ext) garage door key, my mum\u2019s spare key, and two padlock keys on my keyring. But OP seems opposed to keys, and the only way it makes sense at all is if she doesn\u2019t otherwise have to deal with keys.", "Lucky you! Our house belonged to the district of City Center, so not exactly middle of nowhere.\n\nHow it all ended? Well, a coworker of my Dad entered as He knew where to go and found his dead body. No reasoning when he was alive.", "That sounds very responsible to check on, if one knew where the manual was or what brand it is. Probably have it die at an inconvenient time and end up having to call someone with keys and realize I really should've put that spare key on my car key months ago.", "We were always good about locking the doors even before the break ins but after the second one mom installed a heavy duty padlock set on the basement door and our kitchen table spent every night in front of the basement door, because it was wide enough to keep anyone from opening the door from the basement. \n\nA few years back I looked up the home and it had recently sold. The lock set mom installed was still on that door, and there were iron bars on the basement windows... and you could faintly see the dents where the door had slammed into the table and the table had slammed into the wall. \n\nBrought back a lot of memories. \ud83d\ude43\n\nAdd in a stalker in my 30s who stood outside my bedroom window waiting for me to sleep so he could break in and do god knows what and I am rightfully concerned about home safety.", "You don\u2019t know if they store anything in the garage.", "Nice work infantilising this woman by suggesting she is too incompetent to carry a key.", "Do me a favor and point to the escalation, because the only thing OP posted was \"Went for a walk, locked door as is habit, wife was locked out as a result.\"\n\nUnless you mean he's escalating because he's not just acquiescing to her being mad at him, which is unfair.", "Agreed. It\u2019s a bizarre stance to have. I don\u2019t even have kids and I still like to know my adult loved ones are relatively safe inside, keys be damned.", "Please get an analog clock", "As someone who has Not Great time management skills and can be easily distracted, I keep a clock in my living room and bathroom. That way if I\u2019m crafting, reading, doing my makeup, etc., and not paying attention to my phone, I don\u2019t stay up too late or run (too) late.", "I think they might be referring to changing the clocks for daylight savings time, so twice a year changing the batteries on smoke alarms, keypads, etc. Most ovens and microwaves clocks I've seen don't yet adjust to DST automatically.", "No.", "External doors can be an absolute pain to break through. They\u2019re a buffer allowing people inside the home time to call the police, grab a self defense tool, or exit through a different door. \nLocked should be the default on external doors. That also includes balcony doors.", "Breaking in through the garage is preferred due to it being less visible to the outside. I heard a safety talk from a former thief who was working with the police. He said that he would always try to choose a house with a garage entry to the house for this reason. \n\nIf OP's wife doesn't want to carry a key, then a keyless entry sounds like a good compromise imo.", "Depends on your neighborhood? What the hell does that mean?\n\nYou can break garage doors. I don't know what to tell you, but garage doors are not super secure. It is worth locking your inside door.\n\nEdit to add that it's about as secure as your car. They can pry the switch with a coat hanger. \n\nMost people wouldn't be that surprised if their car was broken into even while locked.", "You do know that locks can be broken, right? Garage openers aren't foolproof. If someone wants in & has the right gear, they *will* get in. Locking your door doesn't hurt even if you do believe they'll never get through since it's another layer of safety. But you do you. \n\nAlso, the neighborhood doesn't matter. *Anyone* can be robbed no matter where they live.", "Ouch!  I\u2019m sorry to hear that!!!  That is a most terrible thing to have happen!", "I\u2019d suggest googling the model number or something but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s installed in such a way as to cover anything like that up. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Maybe Google Image Search will be of assistance.", "They say escalating when they run out of things to make up to shit on the man", "I am a Millennial. We kill things. It's what we do.\n\nAnalog clocks will join napkins, diamonds, cable TV, fabric softener, Applebees, postcards, bar soap and American cheese and whatever else Boomers said we have destroyed.", "I just live my chaotic ADHD life.\n\nNot great time management is basically my life story at this point. I embrace chaos.", "Lol", "Well ok then.", "I've had to force a garage door open because I was locked out and once it got to a certain point, the safety on the door kicked in and the door went up on it's own. This was 20 odd years ago, but still. Beyond breaking them, some will open with enough force.", "You're not wrong, but as a millennial who watched that show Revolution where the electricity goes off one day.. I make sure to have some analog stuff packed away just in case!", "I love watching millennials destroy things", "Yeah it's the safety mechanism that takes away some of the security, I think. You don't have to get it up very far to trick the sensor into trying not to drop on something. Idk if that made sense but yeah. Lol"]}
