Um no! What you are doing is protecting yourself, your partner and your child from potentially being stalked again by a very unhinged individual. You have every right to put up boundaries and stand your ground. What your grandmother did was betray you and risked your safety by divulging very private details of your life with a family member of your ex. You are most definitely not the asshole, not even a little. If anything you are badass for not putting up with that crap and protecting your family. Also, I am so sorry that happened to you and that you aren\u2019t getting the support you need from your family.", "NTA it's a simple boundary that only includes keeping her mouth shut and she can't even do that.", "Let me just say that I'm a big fan of family drama, and this juicy post gave me life. So, grab your popcorn, and let's dive into this thrilling tale of grandmas, exes, and first teeth. I've got my witty hat on, so buckle up!\n\nFirst off, congratulations on the 7-month-old! I'm sure he's just as cute as your grandma thinks he is. Your grandma is obviously smitten with the little guy, and as we all know, love makes people do crazy things. Or, in this case, share a little too much information. Now, let's unravel this fascinating yarn.\n\nYour grandma lives with your parents, and you've got a nice, cozy house nearby. Your ex was abusive, and thankfully, you managed to escape that situation. Your grandma and your ex's aunt are coworkers, and your grandma just loves to gossip with her. And that, my friend, is where the trouble begins.\n\nYou've got a perfectly valid concern about your ex finding out where you live. After all, he's had a history of stalking you, and it's only been a year and a half since he's moved away. You'd think that your grandma would understand that, right? But alas, she seems to be caught up in her own little world where everyone shares everything, and all is well. Bless her heart.\n\nI can imagine the frustration you felt when you tried to talk to her about it, and she dismissed your concerns. And then she mentioned telling your ex's aunt about your baby's first tooth? That's like throwing fuel on the fire! You took the reasonable course of action and left, deciding to limit your grandma's access to your baby.\n\nYour mom thinks you're overreacting, but let's dissect that for a moment. You've got an ex with a history of stalking you. Your grandma spills the beans about your life to his aunt. You're worried about your safety and your baby's safety. Overreacting? I think not.\n\nSo, to answer your burning question: You are NTA.", "NTA you have very valid reasons, and you\u2019ve warned your grandma. You gave her the option, she made her decision. To her it was more important to go babbling to your ex-aunt and not respecting your wishes.", "NTA - Wtf is wrong with your grandma ?", "NTA\n\nYour ex has shown stalkerish tendencies.\n\nYou have asked grandma nicely NOT to share details about your life with others, especially his aunt.  She persists & advertises it to you.\n\nThe road runs both ways - your parents can come to your house to visit the baby, unless you want to take baby over when gma isn't home.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA. You have every right to protect yourself and your child from this woman running her mouth off at every opportunity. She was warned and she continued to do it. Game over.", "You're grandmother is still able to work, but unable to keep shut about private information...\n\nKeep your distance, and stay your course. NTA.", "NTA. It's an important situation and she doesn't seem to be grasping the importance of it.\n\nBut damn, I thought I was so lucky that my first child got to meet his great grandmother for a few months before she passed at the age of 85.

Until she realizes that, she needs to be handled differently", "NTA. Does grandma not know that most violence and murders against women are by men that knew them intimately?", "NTA\n\nYour grandma is ignoring your very simple requests and your mom is making excuses for her.

Your parents are only giving you shit because it\u2019s negatively affecting them and inconveniencing them not because you actually over reacted to the situation.

I am willing to do anything to protect my baby, and that includes keeping him away from those who would even bring ex into the outskirts of our lives. I love you all, but you are adults with choices. However baby is not. It up to me and dad to do that, and we have chosen that anyone giving info to ex cannot be around baby.
