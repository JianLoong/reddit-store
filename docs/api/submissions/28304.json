Prior to knowing him (I'll call him Matt for the story), I had a past fianc\u00e9 - I'll call her Amy. \n\nAmy and I were high school sweethearts, our parents were the closest of friends (still are), both our families supported our relationship despite living in a pretty conservative area, and by the time we were 19 we got engaged. Before we could get married, though, Amy was struck and killed by a drunk driver that year. Her parents and I helped each other through what was the darkest year of our lives that year, and I still think of Amy's parents like a second set of parents to this day. They've helped me so much throughout my life before AND after Amy's death, and they were nothing but happy for me to finally get a second chance at love. I want them at my wedding, and they'd love to be there.\n\nMatt's never been overly thrilled about the subject of Amy. I think deep down he's a little insecure and compares himself to her, even though I seldom talk about her and have always made it abundantly clear that it is HIM I love and want to spend the rest of my life with. \n\nWhen I brought up the idea of having Amy's parents, who are like godparents to me, at our wedding, Matt was very unhappy. He thinks it's weird to have my ex's parents present at my wedding to him, even though they've always been supportive of our relationship, and it's not exactly like my ex is in the picture anymore. Matt also thinks it's going to invite trouble from certain members of his side of the family who are...let's just say...rather biased against \"non-traditional\" relationships. I told him that if it's his family members he's worried about, we shouldn't let the bigotry of a few people hold us back from inviting the people we love most to our special day. I owe so much of who I am and what I have to Amy's parents, who have always looked out for me, given me advice, and even helped me out financially so I could get my first house. I insisted to Matt that they be present at my wedding. \n\nHe continues to argue with me about this to this day. Matt still thinks it's weird that I'm inviting them because I was engaged to their daughter, and that it reveals to his more conservative family members that I'm not straight. He feels like I'm not validating his needs enough. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696535935, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170ro31/aita_for_insisting_on_allowing_my_exs_parents_to/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(They should be the ones not invited)\n2 - He can\u2019t deal with the fact that Amy is not your Ex Fianc\u00e9 but is, in fact, your Late Fianc\u00e9. That means there will always be a place in your heart for her and for her family.\nI don\u2019t understand why people this insecure choose to date people that have previously lost a partner. He just doesn\u2019t have the emotional maturity for it. \nWhen my friend lost her husband, she remained a welcome and active part of his family. When she married a few years later, her new husband joined her late husband\u2019s family as well.", "NTA.

You know, the same reason you would invite other guests. \n\nMatt's insecurity and discomfort with a same-sex relationship is showing, and it's a really bad look for someone you think you want to spend your life with.

If Amy's parents are alright with being there (while I'm sure they're happy to see you living life to the fullest, watching you marry someone else might hit too close too home for them), I don't see an issue with it.

He is also seriously lacking maturity if he is insecure over a dead person. \n\nYou don't need to validate his fragile feelings when they involve bigotry and homophobia. You need to accept the reality that he is a bigot too. That means there is a crucial part of you that he does not approve of and is embarrassed by.\n\nIf you insist that he is ok with your sexuality and it's just his family, then the big problem is that he needs to grow a spine and support you. Otherwise if you do marry him be prepared to hide your bisexuality deep in the closet.\n\nAlso, she isn't an EX. She died.

Your fianc\u00e9 is jealous of a ghost and the fact that he doesn\u2019t want Amy\u2019s parents there shows me that he doesn\u2019t take your grief seriously. \n\nSo what, his conservative disapprove? It\u2019s his job as your fianc\u00e9 to defend you.", "NTA. I think your partner is homophobic/biphobic. He reads like someone who thinks you're straight now because you're with him now.", "NTA. He's definitely the asshole and probably biphobic. Not just for putting the comfort of bigoted family members above yours at your own goddamn wedding, but his general discomfort around the subject of Amy is also suspect. It sounds like she and her family were instrumental you becoming the person you are, he cant love that person without accepting that past.

What a ridiculous little person to make a problem out of this. My ex husbands parents were at my wedding, I even did my father daughter dance with my ex husbands father, as my father could not be there. My husband didn\u2019t bat an eyelash at this, because he\u2019s a whole grown up who doesn\u2019t expect the world to cater to his insecurities, and doesn\u2019t try to erase family members of mine (they\u2019re still my family, it\u2019s not their fault their son sucks as a human and partner).", "NTA.

You didn't break up. She's your past fiance. \n\nb) if your current partner is still insecure about the fact that you have your history, you should not be getting married. Do you really think that a wedding will magically make his insecurities go away?\n\nc) Using \"my bigoted relatives might have a problem\" is...well problematic. He's literally taking the stance that he'd prefer to placate his homophobic relatives over your wishes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would REALLY consider at the very least if now is the right time to be marrying this guy, and potentially whether you should be marrying at all. 4 years...damn, I'd be questioning whether he'll ever get over this. So should you.", "I'm", "NTA\n\nYou have a beautiful friendship with a couple who have supported you through many stages of your life.  They want to celebrate your marriage just as you also want them present.  Matt needs to stop being insecure about a past relationship.  There is no competition between him and someone who is dead.  I don\u2019t even understand worrying about homophobia from other wedding guests.  It\u2019s not like you introduce everyone, announcing their exact relationship to the bride & groom.  Wouldn\u2019t they just be viewed as long time family friends?  If you have a seating chart at the reception I\u2019m sure they would be seated with other guests from your friends & family group.  The other guests is a non-issue to me.  Who you OR Matt used to have a relationship with isn\u2019t relevant to your wedding day.", "NTA\n\nYour fiance needs to be uninvited from this wedding for that last comment alone.", "NTA", "NTA I lost my significant other too and I've been thru something similar with my fiance. He believed for so long that he was \"fighting a ghost\" bc I was sad on my first so's birthday or the anniversary of their death. It took him a while before he realized that it's normal to have those feelings. I'm not saying your Matt is in the right, at all. Just giving a reason why he may not feel comfortable. Please have Amy's parents there, they seem like a great set of people.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA and I hope he isn't actually referring to Amy as your ex, since that really is inaccurate and minimises your relationship with her.\n\nAmy is your late fiancee. She passes away whilst you two were engaged. Saying she's your ex sort of implies you two broke up/no longer wanted to be together (which is not the case at all). \n\n\nHe sounds jealous and insecure, and a little homophobic as well. If he wants to hide parts of you at the wedding, he's going to want to get rid of any reminders of Amy once you're married so his family doesn't find out if they visit.", "Well, it\u2019s his wedding too, and if he\u2019s against it I wouldn\u2019t spoil his day with it. Not because of the orientation, more because I am thinking that if my husband wanted his ex- wife\u2019s parents there it would be a reminder to me that my husband was previously engaged to someone else and is being reminded of that on my wedding day. Not something like a birthday, but my wedding. I wouldn\u2019t do it OP.", "Amy is not an \"ex.\" Amy is a \"former.\" Huge difference. You didn't break up.\n\nWeddings should be celebrated with people you love. That includes your former in-laws-to-be.  NTA.", "NTA and your fianc\u00e9 is homophobic and will always hold your past relationship against you.", "NTA.  I think Matt should not come to the wedding either since he is so ashamed you had a life before him.", "NTA", "Don\u2019t call his family bigots?", "NTA.\n\nHe needs to get past his insecurities. And the idea that his relatives need to be somehow sheltered from your bisexuality is kind of contemptible.\n\nIn no universe is it better to coddle the sensibilities of a few bigots than to have your beloved second parents at your wedding.", "NTA. You need to think about if marrying him is the right decision", "How would Matt's family even know who Amy's parents are?  And if they do,so what? Are you really comfortable with marrying into a bigoted,homophobic family? Or, having one as a husband?", "A partner who died is not an ex.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like Amy\u2019s parents are going to go up to people and say \u201cHi, we\u2019re OPs almost in-laws. She was engaged to our daughter before she died. Nice to meet you.\u201d His reasoning is stupid. Unless Amy\u2019s parents actually introduced themselves that way how would they \u201cout\u201d you so to speak?", "NTA. Be careful. You might be marrying a bigot.", "I am so tired of people who are jealous of the dead even though their partner gives them no reason to be.\n\nI am so tired of people who refuse to accept that their partner\u02bbs past is a part of them and part of what made their partner into the person that they love.\n\nThis is one of my favorite quotes on the subject. It\u02bbs from the television show Designing Women\n\n>He said, \"Julia Sugarbaker..\" -- he's an attorney, very theatrical, but anyway -- \"Julia Sugarbaker, you just keep all the memories and pictures of Hayden McIlroy that you want to, because, quite frankly, I don't think I'd want to be with a woman who tried to stop loving her husband just because he died.\" You see, I'd been thinking that it was an either/or proposition. I wasn't thinking that it could be all three of us.\n\nGive me someone wise enough, mature enough and secure enough to say that.\n\nNTA", "Honestly. And if Matt has a problem with it, he can't come either.", "And how will his family even know who they are? I mean, are they going to have introductions where they will stand up and say, \" Our daughter Amy used to be engaged to OP?\"  Will table name cards have the info for all to see? Chances of anyone from his side knowing who they are in detail is minimal unless he goes into detail. And if asked and he is hung up on it, he could answer close family friends, which is true. \n\nSounds like he has the hangup more than anything, and if that is the case, is he the right guy to be marrying?", "That is what I was thinking\u2026 it might be him who\u2019s homophobic", "And what if they have kids, and they aren't cis/het?", "Exactly.  All the weddings I've been to, I couldn't tell  you how the guests knew the groom (if I was bride side,)", "This should be at the top! Sounds like Matt is using the ol\u2019 conservative relative excuse to hide his own homophobia.", "I didn\u2019t want to say that\u2026 but - yeah. I think she should take a step back and think about this\u2026", "This. It makes no sense to refer to Amy as an \u201cex\u201d and it makes no sense for new fianc\u00e9 to think of her that way. Amy was OPs first fianc\u00e9, who died. There\u2019s no bad blood in a situation like that, and no reason for OPs relationship with those parents to end.", "I agree with you that, in most circumstances, it would be weird to invite an exes parents to a wedding. And also that all guests should be agreed on by both the bride and groom. That being said, I do think this situation would be an exception to the first rule. The relationship with Amy is obviously over and there's no way that is going to change. Amy's parents are very important in OP's life and they are supportive of the relationship and wedding. To exclude them would be kind of a slap in the face to the parents and also, it really doesn't address the underlying issue, which is the fiance's insecurities: both regarding OP's previous relationship and how their family might react to the fact that OP is not straight. Hiding this information for the wedding is going to reinforce both the fiance's insecurity about the previous relationship and the idea that there is something wrong with OP having been engaged to a woman. Neither of which are great foundations to a long lasting relationship. \n\nI think they need to get really clear around how they want this relationship to look in the future and how this one conflict will shape that future one way or the other. Does the fiance expect OP to disintegrate the relationship with Amy's parents after the wedding? Or does he just want to maintain that that part of her life is to be kept a secret from his family? And does he feel secure enough in the relationship so as to accept Amy's parents as important figures in OP's life, maybe even developing a relationship with them himself? Or will he always have that gnawing feeling that he was the runner up to Amy? I'd say NAH, but they definitely have some things to work out.", "But given that ex's parent are part of who she is now and who he loves supposedly, he should be more understanding. These same people accepted their relationship. As for his homophobic relatives, they can jump in a lake. It doesn't sound like he has really accepted her past after all.", "Some people are attracted to both?", "Right? It\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to show up in shirts that say \u201cparent of the girl the bride almost married.\u201d", "That was going to be my suggestion too, but it\u2019s usually my answer to these!", "My thoughts exactly", "Ding ding ding.!\nMatt's Homophobic relatives. \"Who are those people\" \nMatt \"close family friends of OP.\n\nIs a non issue...\nMatt's got the problem.", "Exactly what I was wondering", "But I still find it kind of wierd. I come from a background where this has never happened. Like if you want girls stay with them and if you want boys stay with them. This bisexual part is really wierd to me.", "Yes, that's why he's taking it out on her by being in a 4 year relationship and marrying her! It's all part of his dastardly plan! You've sussed it out, good job.", "If he doesn't have a problem, then why is he making an issue out inviting two people who obviously mean a lot to OP? He doesn't need to advertise her previous relationship to everyone who attends.", "You'd be surprised how many homophobic people there are who \"overlook their partner's past indiscretions\". All that matters is that their partner \"is straight now\" (they aren't, who you're with doesn't change your sexuality) and that they can hide it from everyone else.", "Normally I appreciate sarcasm but I think you are totally off here. You act like that never happens... yet it does, sadly more often than we would like to admit. \n\nThis is like when a racist marries someone outside of their race. Maybe their skin color is light/dark enough for the racist to look past it, so they don't come across racist to their partner, but make comments about others of that race, which is horrible to have to be subjected to. Or the outright racist who marry and outright abuse their partner, as if punishing them for their race.\n\nWe aren't talking about race in this instance, but it's bigotry, either way. It sounds like OP's fianc\u00e9 falls into the first type of situation I mentioned... he sees his fianc\u00e9 as het because she is a cis female and marrying him, a cis male. He knows that she was in a queer relationship in the past, but he tries to block that out. That's why he gets irritated anytime the late fianc\u00e9 is mentioned. \n\nI'm sorry, but I think he shares some of the \"bias against non-traditional relationships.\"  If it was just about the family members, why would they matter? And don't get me wrong... I get why family matters... we see it often that people turn a blind eye to troubling beliefs of family members because we love our families, flaws and all. But why would you be worried about family finding out anything about your spouses past relationships from guests at your wedding? I don't think anyone at my wedding asked who someone else was and wasn't satisfied with \"oh they are old family friends,\" and weren't satisfied. And it's not a lie. The parents have been friends for years. So I think fianc\u00e9s objection is based more on his feelings than his concern for what people might think."]}
