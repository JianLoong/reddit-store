Prior to knowing him (I'll call him Matt for the story), I had a past fianc\u00e9 - I'll call her Amy. \n\nAmy and I were high school sweethearts, our parents were the closest of friends (still are), both our families supported our relationship despite living in a pretty conservative area, and by the time we were 19 we got engaged. Before we could get married, though, Amy was struck and killed by a drunk driver that year. Her parents and I helped each other through what was the darkest year of our lives that year, and I still think of Amy's parents like a second set of parents to this day. They've helped me so much throughout my life before AND after Amy's death, and they were nothing but happy for me to finally get a second chance at love. I want them at my wedding, and they'd love to be there.\n\nMatt's never been overly thrilled about the subject of Amy. I think deep down he's a little insecure and compares himself to her, even though I seldom talk about her and have always made it abundantly clear that it is HIM I love and want to spend the rest of my life with. \n\nWhen I brought up the idea of having Amy's parents, who are like godparents to me, at our wedding, Matt was very unhappy. He thinks it's weird to have my ex's parents present at my wedding to him, even though they've always been supportive of our relationship, and it's not exactly like my ex is in the picture anymore. Matt also thinks it's going to invite trouble from certain members of his side of the family who are...let's just say...rather biased against \"non-traditional\" relationships. I told him that if it's his family members he's worried about, we shouldn't let the bigotry of a few people hold us back from inviting the people we love most to our special day. I owe so much of who I am and what I have to Amy's parents, who have always looked out for me, given me advice, and even helped me out financially so I could get my first house. I insisted to Matt that they be present at my wedding. \n\nHe continues to argue with me about this to this day. Matt still thinks it's weird that I'm inviting them because I was engaged to their daughter, and that it reveals to his more conservative family members that I'm not straight. He feels like I'm not validating his needs enough. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696535935, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170ro31/aita_for_insisting_on_allowing_my_exs_parents_to/", "score": 555, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(They should be the ones not invited)\n2 - He can\u2019t deal with the fact that Amy is not your Ex Fianc\u00e9 but is, in fact, your Late Fianc\u00e9. That means there will always be a place in your heart for her and for her family.\nI don\u2019t understand why people this insecure choose to date people that have previously lost a partner. He just doesn\u2019t have the emotional maturity for it. \nWhen my friend lost her husband, she remained a welcome and active part of his family. When she married a few years later, her new husband joined her late husband\u2019s family as well.", "NTA.

You're not inviting them because you were \"engaged to their daughter.\" You are inviting them because you are close with them and value their friendship. You know, the same reason you would invite other guests. \n\nMatt's insecurity and discomfort with a same-sex relationship is showing, and it's a really bad look for someone you think you want to spend your life with.

If Amy's parents are alright with being there (while I'm sure they're happy to see you living life to the fullest, watching you marry someone else might hit too close too home for them), I don't see an issue with it.

He is also seriously lacking maturity if he is insecure over a dead person. \n\nYou don't need to validate his fragile feelings when they involve bigotry and homophobia. You need to accept the reality that he is a bigot too. That means there is a crucial part of you that he does not approve of and is embarrassed by.\n\nIf you insist that he is ok with your sexuality and it's just his family, then the big problem is that he needs to grow a spine and support you. Otherwise if you do marry him be prepared to hide your bisexuality deep in the closet.\n\nAlso, she isn't an EX. She died.

Your fianc\u00e9 is jealous of a ghost and the fact that he doesn\u2019t want Amy\u2019s parents there shows me that he doesn\u2019t take your grief seriously. \n\nSo what, his conservative disapprove? It\u2019s his job as your fianc\u00e9 to defend you.", "NTA. I think your partner is homophobic/biphobic. He reads like someone who thinks you're straight now because you're with him now.", "NTA. He's definitely the asshole and probably biphobic. Not just for putting the comfort of bigoted family members above yours at your own goddamn wedding, but his general discomfort around the subject of Amy is also suspect. It sounds like she and her family were instrumental you becoming the person you are, he cant love that person without accepting that past. If hes insecure get him therapy, you shouldn't have to hide people who are important to you and have been there for you because hes jealous of a dead women or wants to pretend she was never important to you.", "He might think you aren't validating his needs, but he isn't validating your sexuality and is actively trying to hide it.

What a ridiculous little person to make a problem out of this. My ex husbands parents were at my wedding, I even did my father daughter dance with my ex husbands father, as my father could not be there. My husband didn\u2019t bat an eyelash at this, because he\u2019s a whole grown up who doesn\u2019t expect the world to cater to his insecurities, and doesn\u2019t try to erase family members of mine (they\u2019re still my family, it\u2019s not their fault their son sucks as a human and partner).", "NTA.

Hiding this information for the wedding is going to reinforce both the fiance's insecurity about the previous relationship and the idea that there is something wrong with OP having been engaged to a woman. Neither of which are great foundations to a long lasting relationship. \n\nI think they need to get really clear around how they want this relationship to look in the future and how this one conflict will shape that future one way or the other.

Or the outright racist who marry and outright abuse their partner, as if punishing them for their race.\n\nWe aren't talking about race in this instance, but it's bigotry, either way.

Tough tits, indeed.", "Or think twice about marrying someone like him, there are plenty others that would embrace the whole you and accept your all of your family regardless if blood family or not, family is family even the FAMILY YOU CHOOSE.

In that case he should not marry a bisexual. OP please, ask Matt what would he do if your future child was queer and ask him NOW when you have still time to cancel the wedding if he shows you his true colors.", "Imagine if their future children are queer...", "This part.
