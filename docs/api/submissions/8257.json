He has a strained relationship with his family so I had been checking up on him over text most of the evening.\n\nWell when he was at the train station I got a text from him that he needed me, and also what platform he was on.

She was also trying to stop me from getting to him, saying that I would scare him more.\n\nI was able to get past her and calmed him down, she tried to get close again and I turned to her and snapped, telling her something along the lines of you\u2019re not helping, just go away. I don\u2019t remember exactly, I was too focused on my bf.\n\nOnce he was calm I got him on his train and told him to text or call me if anything else happened. I went to leave the station and the lady was there talking to a worker, she then came up to me and said I was an asshole and she was just trying to help. I have a half assed apology and told her that anyone could see she was stressing him out more and she needed to let go of her saviour complex and let someone who actually knew what to do help. \n\nShe there some insults towards me and I just left, now that I\u2019ve calmed down I do worry that I was TA.

Not sure how she thought trying to grab someone who was panicking would help anything.", "NTA. She was prioritizing her own desire to be helpful over his wellbeing and ignoring the signs that her behavior was making it worse, she needed to be told to back off. I would have been more likely to give her the benefit of the doubt if she hadn't been trying to touch him without his consent and trying to stop you from getting to him. Good intentions or not, her behavior sucked and she is the AH for getting upset at you for calling that out.", "NTA. She made a mistake, which can happen, and since you were in a stressful situation you went overboard, which is understandable. She should have apologized the moment she saw you knew what you were doing, or at the very least inquired about your bf. Don't feel bad, sometimes people snap, that doesn't magically turn them into bad people.", "NTA. You knew what you were doing and you could tell she was making the situation worse even though her intentions were pure.

No. And while its not your responsibility, this could have been a learning moment. \n\nAt the end of the day, you did right by your boyfriend and that is the most crucial thing.", "NTA, meaning well doesn't excuse her behavior, she needed a reality check.", "NTA\n\nShe might have think that she was doing good, but if it wasn't for you your boyfriend could get worse.

Which is a pretty normal thing to do when witnessing someone having a serious meltdown.

She wouldn't have known the extent of your bf's situation. She saw a fellow human being having a panic attack and wanted to help.\n\nYour response wasn't nice, but it came from your own frustration and worry at that point. \n\nIf everything had been left there, then neither of you would have been AHs. Her coming up to you after wasn't a great idea. You telling her she had a saviour complex wasn't a good idea. Exchanging insults was a dick move on both sides.", "NAH.\n\nYou were both trying to help.  It's OK that you were short with her in order to be helpful to him. \n\nI don't know if you made it clear to her that you were this person's friend, but if you did then she should have backed off.", "soft YTA - you could have been more patient with the lady, who was just trying to help and probably didn't understand the situation completely. But it's entirely forgivable and understandable that you reacted to her the way you did given how stressed you were.", "Going against all this. YTA. A woman sees a person having what you describe as a meltdown. She does what most compassionate ppl would do, goes over and tries to calm him down (not knowing he\u2019s autistic and may not like to be touched). Sure we should all have physical boundaries, but this panic attack sounds pretty bad and may have been scary to this woman herself. Here comes this stranger blowing in and telling you to back off they got it. Who are you? Let\u2019s change it up. A young woman is having a panic attack and a meltdown and a woman tries to help. Exactly the same way. Here comes a man rushing in and says back off I got this. Who is he? Is this person actually gonna be safe with this stranger? I would hate to leave and something happens. She wasn\u2019t necessarily trying to butt in and takeover, etc. Had it taken you longer to get there, you should be glad someone stopped to at least try to help him so he wasn\u2019t all alone on the platform. Way too big of a reaction to this woman whether she was likable or not she was there when you weren\u2019t. All you had to say was thanks, we\u2019re together, really appreciate you waiting with him for me to get here, thanks for helping him. You rightfully came with high energy afraid for your bf, but took that our on a stranger who was just trying to help.", "Yes. Yta.

Further, she still made an issue of it after you called him down, even calling security.  That's not how you \"help\" someone and she should have backed off when she noticed that your BF was responding well to you.  Also, I would have to imagine that her sticking around for a minute or so she would have observed that you two knew each other, making her behavior worse.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't owe her any more than the half assed apology that you gave her.

NTA", ">She may have had good intention but she wasn't being helpful.\n\nSince she was being awfully insistent and entitled and turned extremely hostile, it makes me wonder if bf was targeted and she had a Church van around the corner.

I don't know exactly what the OP's bf's meltdown entailed, but there's a real possibility that the woman on the scene might have been concerned about a possible suicide attempt. I've been in that situation myself years ago. I positioned myself between the person and the tracks whilst someone else went for help. Every time they moved, I moved in response to make sure I was always blocking them, and if they would've tried to get past me towards the tracks I absolutely would've grabbed them.", "That's quite a leap from \"strained relationship\"", "Oops, so sorry about that I\u2019ll edit", "I said friend because it doesn't matter if she was girlfriend, friend, or partner.
