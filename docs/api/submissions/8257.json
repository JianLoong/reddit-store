Even if it wasn't next to tracks, he was clearly in distress and in need of help. She was exercising kindness to try to assist someone in a (maybe) dangerous position. While you say \"anyone can see you're stressing him out,\" I don't believe that is true, depending on what his episode actually looked like. Just because you, his partner, could see that her attempts to help were stressing him out, doesn't mean everyone can. For all she knew (and hell for all you knew) his stress was completely independent of her help the entire time. You've said in some comments that you don't know exactly what triggered this episode.\n\nBut why you're TA in my book is that nowhere in your account did you communicate that you're this person's partner and have a high chance to be able to help and even speak on his behalf. For all she knew you were a rando who also 'had a savior complex' and you'd make the situation worse too. Don't forget, she had been there experiencing his difficulty being communicated to by a stranger and you never said why your help is any different. A simple \"He's my boyfriend\" would have explained everything in three words.\n\nYou're not seeing this from her perspective at all and judged her poorly as a result. She was trying to help your bf, and you lashed out at her when she had no reason to hand the situation over to you. \n\nWhile understandable that people are jerks in times of crisis, you came here to reflect on whether or not you handled this well. \n\nYour bf is okay, and that's the #1 thing. But YTA", "I get this so much, like you and  very_busy_ newt, I have panic attacks and people always think crowding around and touching is the best way to help and I try very hard to tell people no. Maybe sometimes, but very specific people like my sister. If she sees me in the middle of a panic attacks, she remains calm, asks if I wanna be alone or have company. She sits next to me until I say if touching is allowed or not. Hugs or just a presence nearby from someone who I consider safe goes a long way, but sometimes being alone is better. \nWhoever is having a panic attacks will somehow give you clues to what they want by body language like he was above.
