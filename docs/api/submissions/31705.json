AT 12PM. One hour is plenty of time to fry. If they were on 20 minutes later at \\~12:20 pm, then they were over forty minutes early, and they were expecting their son and postpartum DIL to accommodate that time shift, and when it turned out that son and DIL couldn't, they canceled instead of waiting for the original, agreed upon time.  \n\nAlso, with a wife so badly affected by PPD/PPA, why was her husband making her cook by herself for three hours (cook since 9am... still boiling (around 12pm)) without saying anything? Their baby is only 4 months old!   \n\n\nI would say OP is NTA.", "NAH\n\nDepression is caused by an imbalance in hormones, and pregnancy/postpartum are the worst on hormones.

Good luck :)", "NTA\u2026 I agree with your thoughts and feeling entirely BUT I don\u2019t think your husband is wrong either. These types of miscommunications happen, especially with elderly parents trying to use technology. Reconnecting in 20 minutes could have been too much for them and when your husband asked and they got that scared, confused look on their faces I completely understand him trying to reassure them by saying they can just meet tomorrow.

He didn't mess up.", "She\u2019s cooking and stated she performs daily chores and has a young child if he was helping her she wouldn\u2019t have been this overwhelmed.

Good luck!", "No, I mean, why would you go for someone who's so much older than you? \n\nYou're bound to have different expectations and desires for life. I'm surprised no one else pointed that out.

But this isn\u2019t even the point, the biggest problem is that she wasn\u2019t consulted by the husband, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s upset, he decided to cancel the call on his own and there is no reason given he couldn\u2019t have consulted her first, she even said she hates when he does that, why isn\u2019t he getting the memo?", "I would agree about the age gap and how dangerous it may be if that difference is , in general, when one of the parts is a teen or early 20s .

You took a risk they wouldn't be ready for a while. If they showed up 25 minutes later, no problem, but they showed up 3 minutes later, so you should have set the fries aside or turned off the oven and finished baking them later.\n\nIt was no one else's fault but yours that you decided to start cooking the fries while you were already waiting for his parents. You should have been mature and said \"oops, this is my fault, I'll put the fried on hold and attend the call that we were already waiting for.\" Instead, you insisted everyone wait longer for *you* and got upset when your husband didn't want to make his 80+ yo and very tech-averse parents wait on a zoom call.", "It\u2019s just a video call, why couldn\u2019t you just cook the fries during the call? He could have spoke to the parents while you were finishing up and then left them to cool down a bit and joined the conversation. Is it formal? I\u2019ve eaten during calls and it was never a problem. You could have just explained to the parents you guys were hungry and asked if it was alright to eat in front of them and if not just eat after the call. Why delay it for 20 minutes?", "You could have just pulled them out of the pan instead of finishing cooking them. They would have been fine re-dropping them.", "She doesn't say that she had to that conversation with him before . She says that she had told him they were important to her ( but not more important than fries , apparently ), and that she explained this time that she gets \" furious \" when he cancels without checking with her .  If he did it again after this outburst then yeah , he is disrespecting her wishes .  I have every sympathy with OP not feeling well at present , but knowing that you are waiting for elderly people to come on a call ( who she says need someone else to set it up for them ) is not the time to make food that you need to eat immediately, and then kick off because everyone does not want to wait for you to eat fries.  \n \nBut I am more concerned about furious. This is a minor irritation at best , it should not be the kind of situation that generates fury.  It's hardly a big deal .", "Because eating , attending the conversation (in another language) and taking care of a 4 month old, all together  , is a little bit ...impossible. \n\nIndeed should have told him to start without me and just make mew fries later.", "Sure, she didn\u2019t outright say she conveyed to him her wishes beforehand, and if OP comes here and confirms she didn\u2019t say a peep, then she wouldn\u2019t be right to be upset at him, right, but I\u2019m inclined to believe she did say something because the likelihood of her not expressing dislike over the other times he cancelled the meeting without her, something that she \u201chates\u201d, are more unlikely than likely. About cooking the food, cleary she thought she had the time, she didn\u2019t think it was \u201cany minute now\u201d, and frankly she was allowed to, because they got late on her, if somebody makes you wait, you have the right to make them wait back", "And they have the right to say that they are not prepared to wait.

Reasonable even . \" Husband , going forward can you consult me about changing plans like this \"  \" yes , that's fine \". End of convo . Being furious and causing a huge argument is my issue here .

He caused the argument", "NAH, you have PP and are struggling but your husband is also likely struggling as he has no idea what really happens in a woman\u2019s head while goin through that.

I say that, not to ne dismissive, but because you seem to be really upset over a very minor issue.  Also, you are already aware you're having some postpartum depression and are on a new medication.  All that could easily explain your reaction.  Go easy on yourself and your guy.  You're both stretched thin and exhausted right now.", "Oh sha, you need to give yourself some grace.

It's also the fact that he rescheduled YALLS call without even consulting you. I don't think it's anyone's fault per say but I do think you could do better to communicate when you're feeling extra excited for the call and your husband could be more supportive and logical about how he handles these things.

You just need to understand that yes, you are wrong in this case. I know your emotions feel hard to ignore, and no one should ask you to, but you need to understand that being a mother and caring for a baby does not make you the center of everyone's world and does not mean you get to dictate the schedule as you see fit. I'm not trying to be harsh, but a lot of new mothers have trouble with this because all of the hormones tell you that your baby is the most important thing ever and the PPD makes it hard to sympathize with anyone else. You may be the AH in this case, but you'll get through it. Maybe think about therapy? That helped my wife tremendously.

Small inconveniences can feel huge when you have PPD. Don't get me wrong, I apologised profusely to my partner when I finally got out the other side of PPD, because I thought of all the incidences I had had a ridiculous reaction to something, and how difficult I had been. But my partner always told me that it was ok because he understood I was going through a really difficult time, and he understood more afterwards because I was able to articulate better what I was going through. Be kind to yourself and to your husband, I know it's really hard right now.

It doesn't make her an AH to have a bad time processing her emotions right now.\n\nHusband is also not TA because he did what he thought was best for everyone.

You thankfully was given medication for the PPD and has made a difference in how you feel. Great I love to hear this. You cleaned up got ready took time to make yourself look nice for the call.

You saying he doesnt care that you took the time to get ready is not the case. \n\nOk so the call didnt happen exactly when it was suppose to thats life it happens.

Times are not matching etc etc. It sounds like you are being childish about the entire situation but dont want to be accountable because you have PPD. No ma'am that is not the way it works. PPD has finally been taken serious after years of doctors saying its just the baby blues and you will be just fine. So for you to use this condition to try to get people to feel sorry for you doesnt cut it in my book. Especially after watching the hell my daughter went through with PPD and PPP. \n\nSounds to me like you are just acting childish  and didnt like your husbands response to your act. So you run to social media hoping people will feel for you and take your side because you are dealing with a mental condition.

I think a good chunk of what's bothering you is based on your personal biases and preferences (common thing with autistic people, but here it could well be the PPD stressing you out and getting you centrally focused). You want the call today, husband and in-laws would prefer to delay. I don't see this as cancelling, and they're not cancelling on you. It's frustrating for you as you're having good days and bad days and I can see being worried about the reschedule being on a bad day. But it's a video call, so I think you can reign in somewhat your need to get ready. Lessen the pressure on yourself - if these people are good folk they know someone who just had a baby is gonna be frazzled at times. \n\nI feel like it would be advantageous for you to reach out to parenting groups just so you're not as alone and have some people of your own age to talk to and socialise with.

He knew why I was wanting the hug and he would talk to me and either explain (if he was the source of the problem) or reassure me.
