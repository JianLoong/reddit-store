The parents bear some blame for not being online on time, but you knew they needed help.  More to the point, they were willing to be OK with cancelling since the schedule got messed up.

And even then You could just eat fries and let Your husband talk alone with his parents for 10-15mins. But again- no. And it is not Your husband who cancelled it. IT WAS YOU. You weren't ready because You wanted fires. You said they have to wait for You, but they could just start without You. So if You are not ready, they can't talk without You because...

You should have just let him start the call and left them as soon as you safely could. He also overdid it by canceling though he probably thought it was rude to make them just sit and wait for 20 minutes.", "Okay, so you two have a 15 year age difference, and English is \"not even your second language\", and you don't have any family or anyone else to talk to about your struggles with postpartum or your joys of having a baby? \n\nI really don't think this is about him canceling meetings without telling you. \n\nAnd she said in a comment that the call was scheduled for 1pm, and she started frying at NOON. AT 12PM. One hour is plenty of time to fry. If they were on 20 minutes later at \\~12:20 pm, then they were over forty minutes early, and they were expecting their son and postpartum DIL to accommodate that time shift, and when it turned out that son and DIL couldn't, they canceled instead of waiting for the original, agreed upon time.  \n\nAlso, with a wife so badly affected by PPD/PPA, why was her husband making her cook by herself for three hours (cook since 9am... still boiling (around 12pm)) without saying anything? Their baby is only 4 months old!   \n\n\nI would say OP is NTA.", "NAH\n\nDepression is caused by an imbalance in hormones, and pregnancy/postpartum are the worst on hormones. Your emotions are going to be all over the place, and when you have a good day, it's hard when things don't go exactly right because it feels a little like you're slipping. \n\nI don't think this was an intentional slight on his end. The timing just didn't work out. You said his parents aren't very good with Skype and need his brother's help. Maybe his brother wasn't going to be available in 20 minutes. \n\nKeep having a wonderful day, and let's hope things go well tomorrow. Stew sounds amazing and you are amazing for getting up and getting it going.", "NTA\nIt sounds like your struggling with all the chores and responsibilities which in turn is making you lash out. Your older husband should help you out and divide these tasks so you don\u2019t feel so overwhelmed. I hope you can give yourself some downtime to relax as it sounds like your only source of happiness is speaking to his parents and that being tampered with is affecting how you feel. I hear you and see you, give yourself some grace and ask for help that way you won\u2019t resent your husband!. Good luck :)", "NTA\u2026 I agree with your thoughts and feeling entirely BUT I don\u2019t think your husband is wrong either. These types of miscommunications happen, especially with elderly parents trying to use technology. Reconnecting in 20 minutes could have been too much for them and when your husband asked and they got that scared, confused look on their faces I completely understand him trying to reassure them by saying they can just meet tomorrow. You should both have grace for each other and understand that sometimes situations don\u2019t work out without fault.", "NTA, I think people aren\u2019t taking into account that she thought she would have time, so it\u2019s understandable that she would cook beforehand, and the parents were the ones running late, I understand that they are elderly, but since we are basing on who\u2019s respecting who\u2019s time, technically they were the ones running late, so I can\u2019t see why the husband just couldn\u2019t keep the call open and mute the mic while they eat if it would be complicated for the parents to resume call after 20 minutes, or why he couldn\u2019t at least consult her before deciding on cancelling it, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s upset, because she wasn\u2019t consulted and these video calls are important to her. He messed up, it\u2019s not your fault OP, both learn from this experience", "NTA. Fries taste horrible when reheated.", "YTA.

Should have just delayed that or chose something else to cook that day that would allow you to be more flexible with timing. Just a suggestion for the next time.", "You need to apologise to your husband.", "It's a complete over reaction . The elderly people who cannot set up were late , instead of waiting she decided to go and make food that apparently could not just be kept warm . So she wanted them to what ... Just hang on the call for 20 minutes waiting , or did you want these people to go through having to set up again ?", "She is the one expecting too much to revolve around her.  He didn't mess up.", "She\u2019s cooking and stated she performs daily chores and has a young child if he was helping her she wouldn\u2019t have been this overwhelmed. Tired of users seeing everything as black and white and responding to someone who has clearly mentioned they are going through mental strife with YTA you did this you did that instead of looking at the bigger picture and empathising.", "I mean, I think this was a learning experience for you both, now you are more smart about contingencies, and your husband (hopefully) now knows you want to be consulted first if possible, not a big ask. Good luck!", "No, I mean, why would you go for someone who's so much older than you? \n\nYou're bound to have different expectations and desires for life. I'm surprised no one else pointed that out. It's usually one of the first things people say in AITA posts.", "Agreed,  just the stupid potatoes were already on the pan and didn't want to throw them away . Next time, indeed , we'll ask for takeout .", "You say the parents shouldn\u2019t wait but for some reason she should? They can keep the call open if it\u2019s complicated to resume afterwards, and it\u2019s not like they need to stare at the screen for 20 minutes lol, they can do other stuff, and when OP and husband are ready they call for them. But this isn\u2019t even the point, the biggest problem is that she wasn\u2019t consulted by the husband, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s upset, he decided to cancel the call on his own and there is no reason given he couldn\u2019t have consulted her first, she even said she hates when he does that, why isn\u2019t he getting the memo?", "I would agree about the age gap and how dangerous it may be if that difference is , in general, when one of the parts is a teen or early 20s . AKA = not fully matured.\n\nWe met when I was 18 , didn't start a relationship after 8 years of knowing each other.  Even if I posted this AITA situation,  I love him tons and I know he does love me back.", "The problem is you knew you were waiting for someone and you decided to start a process that takes 20 minutes. You took a risk they wouldn't be ready for a while. If they showed up 25 minutes later, no problem, but they showed up 3 minutes later, so you should have set the fries aside or turned off the oven and finished baking them later.\n\nIt was no one else's fault but yours that you decided to start cooking the fries while you were already waiting for his parents. You should have been mature and said \"oops, this is my fault, I'll put the fried on hold and attend the call that we were already waiting for.\" Instead, you insisted everyone wait longer for *you* and got upset when your husband didn't want to make his 80+ yo and very tech-averse parents wait on a zoom call.", "It\u2019s just a video call, why couldn\u2019t you just cook the fries during the call? He could have spoke to the parents while you were finishing up and then left them to cool down a bit and joined the conversation. Is it formal? I\u2019ve eaten during calls and it was never a problem. You could have just explained to the parents you guys were hungry and asked if it was alright to eat in front of them and if not just eat after the call. Why delay it for 20 minutes?", "You could have just pulled them out of the pan instead of finishing cooking them. They would have been fine re-dropping them.", "She doesn't say that she had to that conversation with him before . She says that she had told him they were important to her ( but not more important than fries , apparently ), and that she explained this time that she gets \" furious \" when he cancels without checking with her .  If he did it again after this outburst then yeah , he is disrespecting her wishes .  I have every sympathy with OP not feeling well at present , but knowing that you are waiting for elderly people to come on a call ( who she says need someone else to set it up for them ) is not the time to make food that you need to eat immediately, and then kick off because everyone does not want to wait for you to eat fries.  \n \nBut I am more concerned about furious. This is a minor irritation at best , it should not be the kind of situation that generates fury.  It's hardly a big deal .", "Because eating , attending the conversation (in another language) and taking care of a 4 month old, all together  , is a little bit ...impossible. \n\nIndeed should have told him to start without me and just make mew fries later.", "Sure, she didn\u2019t outright say she conveyed to him her wishes beforehand, and if OP comes here and confirms she didn\u2019t say a peep, then she wouldn\u2019t be right to be upset at him, right, but I\u2019m inclined to believe she did say something because the likelihood of her not expressing dislike over the other times he cancelled the meeting without her, something that she \u201chates\u201d, are more unlikely than likely. About cooking the food, cleary she thought she had the time, she didn\u2019t think it was \u201cany minute now\u201d, and frankly she was allowed to, because they got late on her, if somebody makes you wait, you have the right to make them wait back", "And they have the right to say that they are not prepared to wait. It's been rearranged for the next day , it's such a non issue to be getting furious about.", "They do, but the husband didn\u2019t convey that to her, and that\u2019s the issue, it doesn\u2019t matter that for you, opinionsarelikeahs, it\u2019s not a problem, she wants to be consulted if possible, and I don\u2019t understand why you think that\u2019s an unreasonable ask\nEdit: oh, providing the reason the call was cancelled was because the parents decided on that, for all we know the husband could have made that decision all by himself too", "And that's fine . Reasonable even . \" Husband , going forward can you consult me about changing plans like this \"  \" yes , that's fine \". End of convo . Being furious and causing a huge argument is my issue here . I cannot imagine living with someone who gets to the point of fury over such a minor thing.", "If only it was the first time, since she likely expressed her wish beforehand, so not only did he not listen to her request, he didn\u2019t listen to her this time either, because she said she tried explaining to him how she hates when he does that and his response was \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be upset about it\u201d and didn\u2019t take her seriously. He caused the argument"]}
