Prior to the visit, his wife texted in the group thread informing me that their oldest son had a biopsy and came back positive for an autoimmune skin disease.\n\nFast forward to the middle of our visit, they had to go to my grandson\u2019s follow-up appointment. When they came home, my daughter-in-law updated me what the dermatologist said. I commented, \u201cMaybe he just had a reaction to dogs.\u201d She suddenly grew quiet, reiterated what she sent on text before our arrival that my grandson\u2019s skin issues have \u201cno known cause or cure but can be managed by topical steroids,\u201d and definitely not caused by a reaction to dogs, then she changed the topic. My son and his family do not have dogs but the previous homeowners had two large canine pets.\n\nWhen my husband and I got back to our own home, I noticed that my daughter-in-law stopped responding to group texts regardless of who initiates the messages. She doesn\u2019t pick up my calls either. I asked my son how she\u2019s doing and why she\u2019s ignoring messages and he admitted that she blocked me because of my \u201creaction to dogs\u201d comment. \n\nMy son said that his wife felt insulted. She told him something like, \u201cYour mom implied that our son is sick because of the house we chose to buy and that we moved in without cleaning it.\u201d\n\nOf course that wasn\u2019t what I meant about my \u201creaction to dogs\u201d comment. Now, I greatly believe my daughter-in-law is overreacting and me voicing out my theory didn\u2019t warrant being blocked by her.

It was likely based in your own bias against dogs. It was not asked for, nor needed by anyone\u2026.especially the parents. \n\n3) You downplayed the diagnosis. And completely ignored the information your grandson\u2019s mother provided. Information that she did not have to give you. Information you are not entitled too, in any way. An autoimmune disorder can be serious, especially one that the cause hasn\u2019t been discovered. It can escalate in severity and lead to hospitalization, or worse, especially with an unknown cause. Instead of offering concern, sympathy, or understanding, you offer up \u2018it\u2019s caused by dogs,\u2019 instead. \n\n4) You implied that the house is not clean enough for your standards.\n\n5) Missing reasons in post. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first time your daughter in law has had to ignore passive aggressive insults from you.

OP, do you realize that the child has already been to a doctor, has already been subjected to multiple tests, likely already went to a specialist who confirmed the diagnosis and is now in specific treatment? I'll break it down this way, an autoimmune disease is in it's  simplest terms basically your body suddenly becoming \"allergic,\" or thinking it was \"allergic\" to something else naturally in your own body.

When they came home, my daughter-in-law updated me what the dermatologist said.

My son and his family do not have dogs but the previous homeowners had two large canine pets.\n\nWhen my husband and I got back to our own home, I noticed that my daughter-in-law stopped responding to group texts regardless of who initiates the messages. She doesn\u2019t pick up my calls either. I asked my son how she\u2019s doing and why she\u2019s ignoring messages and he admitted that she blocked me because of my \u201creaction to dogs\u201d comment. \n\nMy son said that his wife felt insulted.

Do really think a doctor went straight to a biopsy on a child before checking for the most common allergens? \n\nThe process is usually: a complete and thorough history, with the onset of disease and any unique circumstances surrounding onset. Blood work and/or a skin patch test for common allergens, then blood work and skin patch tests for LESS common allergens. At this point they'll usually also run serology tests to look for auto immune markers, like anti nuclear antibody tests. Presence of this antibody means there is an auto immune disorder, but it's not specific to what type of auto immune disorder. It is not present in allergic reaction, period. Shocker of all shocks, there's also tests for chronic allergic reaction. Tryptase is released by mast cells in allergic reactions and elevated serum tryptase levels indicate allergic reaction.\n\nFrom here, if the allergen testing is negative and the serology testing is positive for ANA, they have to nail down which disorder. Most auto immune disorders of the skin have characteristics that help narrow it down, but they can rule some out with bloodwork.
