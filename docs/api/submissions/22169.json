Prior to the visit, his wife texted in the group thread informing me that their oldest son had a biopsy and came back positive for an autoimmune skin disease.\n\nFast forward to the middle of our visit, they had to go to my grandson\u2019s follow-up appointment. When they came home, my daughter-in-law updated me what the dermatologist said. I commented, \u201cMaybe he just had a reaction to dogs.\u201d She suddenly grew quiet, reiterated what she sent on text before our arrival that my grandson\u2019s skin issues have \u201cno known cause or cure but can be managed by topical steroids,\u201d and definitely not caused by a reaction to dogs, then she changed the topic. My son and his family do not have dogs but the previous homeowners had two large canine pets.\n\nWhen my husband and I got back to our own home, I noticed that my daughter-in-law stopped responding to group texts regardless of who initiates the messages. She doesn\u2019t pick up my calls either. I asked my son how she\u2019s doing and why she\u2019s ignoring messages and he admitted that she blocked me because of my \u201creaction to dogs\u201d comment. \n\nMy son said that his wife felt insulted. She told him something like, \u201cYour mom implied that our son is sick because of the house we chose to buy and that we moved in without cleaning it.\u201d\n\nOf course that wasn\u2019t what I meant about my \u201creaction to dogs\u201d comment. Now, I greatly believe my daughter-in-law is overreacting and me voicing out my theory didn\u2019t warrant being blocked by her.

It was likely based in your own bias against dogs. It was not asked for, nor needed by anyone\u2026.especially the parents. \n\n3) You downplayed the diagnosis. And completely ignored the information your grandson\u2019s mother provided. Information that she did not have to give you. Information you are not entitled too, in any way. An autoimmune disorder can be serious, especially one that the cause hasn\u2019t been discovered. It can escalate in severity and lead to hospitalization, or worse, especially with an unknown cause. Instead of offering concern, sympathy, or understanding, you offer up \u2018it\u2019s caused by dogs,\u2019 instead. \n\n4) You implied that the house is not clean enough for your standards.\n\n5) Missing reasons in post. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first time your daughter in law has had to ignore passive aggressive insults from you.

OP, do you realize that the child has already been to a doctor, has already been subjected to multiple tests, likely already went to a specialist who confirmed the diagnosis and is now in specific treatment? I'll break it down this way, an autoimmune disease is in it's  simplest terms basically your body suddenly becoming \"allergic,\" or thinking it was \"allergic\" to something else naturally in your own body.

When they came home, my daughter-in-law updated me what the dermatologist said.

My son and his family do not have dogs but the previous homeowners had two large canine pets.\n\nWhen my husband and I got back to our own home, I noticed that my daughter-in-law stopped responding to group texts regardless of who initiates the messages. She doesn\u2019t pick up my calls either. I asked my son how she\u2019s doing and why she\u2019s ignoring messages and he admitted that she blocked me because of my \u201creaction to dogs\u201d comment. \n\nMy son said that his wife felt insulted.

It took three more months of weekly professional cleanings and 5 of me having to take prescribed medicine and regular visits to my allergist and the dermatologist before I was able to get \u201cbetter\u201d.

We live in a different state and every time I spoke to her on the phone, the first two things she\u2019d say were.. \u201cis he talking yet?\u201d, and, \u201cis he trained?\u201d  (Meaning; is he toilet trained). He wasn\u2019t talking last we spoke two weeks ago, and no, he\u2019s not magically developed language since then. \n\nHugs to you xx", "TF is \u201ccluey?\u201d", "I\u2019ve also come to realise that maybe older family members sometimes take it personally when there\u2019s an illness in the family. It\u2019s weird, but it\u2019s like they see it as a reflection on themselves. My husband and both his sisters have type 2 diabetes. They likely have a genetic predisposition combined with lifestyle factors. MIL flat out doesn\u2019t believe they have it.", "Why dogs? Because dogs used to live in this house with the previous owners. And OP believes that it\u2019s a shitty house to begin with, so it must be connected! \n\nWhat a nightmare of a MIL", "Can\u2019t forget Calamine lotion.", "My own grandmother did what OP is doing to her family to me about the deadly food allergies I have. Telling a ten year old who has nearly died in the past that they should try a bit and see what happens is never a popular move. My mother and I don\u2019t talk to her anymore, and haven\u2019t for a long time. OP has hit a raw nerve, and she might not like the reaction she gets", "Probably. Know-it-all-MILs are notorious for \u201cmissing missing reasons.\u201d", "There is a lot more. Read OP\u2019s post history", "Thank you, have added it now", "Same same!  One of my dearest friends is my almost MIL.  Her son and I (still a good friend) have been broken up for 20 years now, and she and I are still super close.\n\nMy mom is just the best also.  She and dad are so funny (they're no longer together but are good friends), whenever my sister and I say what great parents they are they always say stuff like \"oooh no...we made so many mistakes!\"\n\nI'm so blessed, and it just reminds me when I read stories like this.  One of my darling coworkers has an MIL like this, it just sounds miserable.\n\nLike...let people live their lives!  \n\n\nEDIT: evil apostrophe appeared from nowhere!", "I hope your son is doing ok with his medical condition if that is your MIL", "Yep. We voted pizza is the best food ever. OP is the worst.", "Exactly. It could be a condition like psoriasis, which can cause a lot of mental distress for patients but hopefully won't be too limiting. But equally, could be a manifestation of a really serious systemic immune disorder such as lupus, IBD, or coeliac, or arhritis or something. I would be so angry if my kid got diagnosed with a potentially life changing or limiting AI condition and a relative put it down to dog allergies.\n\nJust to clarify my above explanation as well, not all autoimmune conditions are necessarily caused by autoantibodies, they can be caused by non antibody mediated inflammation too, but the main thing about AI conditions is that they destroy/harm your own tissues.", "I have some questions similar to what I went through... Do you mind if I DM you?", "Oh Lordy are we in the same family? My sister has PCOS and infertility, and our mother is still convinced that it must be something in her diet/lifestyle/etc that caused her to not be able to sustain a pregnancy because how could she possibly have made a daughter that is \u201cbroken.\u201d  She gets so offended. \ud83d\ude44", "Ya you're probably right. My grandma RIP, who was super sweet, literally didn't tell anyone for YEARS she had cancer. Because she grew up in a hyper religious family (probably normal for the time) and believed that she somehow must've done something bad/evil to get cancer. My theory? She was 95 and unfortunately something's gonna get you.", "And for \u201cjust saying\u201d innocent things, offending someone and then going all shocked pikachu face when told to piss off", "That explains everything.  DIL is right, OP is as wrong as wrong can be.  Grrrrr", "Read it...odds are she still won't think she did anything wrong even after all this", "Oh dear. My mom just does the opposite. Every thing someone has, has to be related to family. The good things from her side, the bad things like illnesses from dads side. \nYeah mam, you\u2019re a dna-expert, you\u2019ll know. \n\nNot. I think it all has to do with our moms wanting to make sure that we understand it\u2019s not their fault. Or to blame someone they don\u2019t like, as op does. \n\nAnyway. Yta. You really thought 5 years of watching greys anatomy would make you solve health cases quicker? And throw in a hidden \u2018you are not clean\u2019 message?", "100% it\u2019s the missing missing reasons all over again. \nBut I didn\u2019t say anything bad! I just shared my opinion!!! - the classic story"]}
