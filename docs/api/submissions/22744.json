There\u2019s no bad blood which is great so why not make an effort to have a relationship? Doesn\u2019t hurt and they probably felt hurt bc they considered you family even though you\u2019re not close.

I tried to stay in contact with both of them when they first moved to college but they stopped responding over time. I was still a kid in elementary school and I didn\u2019t have my own phone or anything, I\u2019d mail letters and they visited for the few springs breaks. I kept trying for a while when I got my own phone but the were both busy and never seemed to really care if we connected.

To be honest, when you\u2019re young and in school, you\u2019re thinking mostly of yourself. I\u2019m sure they appreciated your effort but was just wrapped up in their own lives as young adults, etc. Their reactions when they weren\u2019t invited to the wedding makes it apparent that they do consider you family and do care to be there for you on your special day. This is totally up to you and your call but for me, I would invite them to the wedding anyway. You are going out of your way to show that you want them in your life (yay for taking the high road and being the bigger man in a way) and when you\u2019re older, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel better that they were there.

Not the engagement party, bridal shower, Bachelorette or anything else.\n\nIt sounds like none of you have made an effort as adults so I'm not sure why they'd assume they were invited to your wedding.", "NTA They are not really part of your life so why would you invite them to your wedding? You made an overture to your half brother when you invited him to the engagement party but he rebuffed it.", "They\u2019re actually pretty close with my mom now as adults.
