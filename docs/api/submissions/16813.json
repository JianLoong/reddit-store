This lady just wants to stay on your mind; she has given up on doing so in a good way, so now she's willing to just be a thorn in your side. \n\nIt's absolutely ludicrous that she is griping about you using something that is now a literal permanent addition to your home.

Many trans guys use prosthetics, which can range something like $1k to $3k. Designed to be very much like cis genitals and that\u2019s so personal. Some don\u2019t change that out between partners because other guys don\u2019t change out their dick. Some lgbt+ couples will just get a new \u201cdick\u201d each time a new partner comes into their life. That\u2019s the advantage of being a trans guy. So the idea that I would ever keep her sex toys, especially after she broke consent and cheated, is gross. The first thing I did was get tested and thoroughly cleaned most of my home. The gross part of cheating isn\u2019t actually the sex or bodies or even STDs, but the breaking of consent. That\u2019s why it isn\u2019t the same as sharing sex toys or opening up a relationship. It isn\u2019t consensual. This might be TMI, but I figured I\u2019d take the opportunity to educate.", "Was just thinking the same thing, but I am petty at times.", "Okay just came here to say that I got honestly surprised by the amount of awareness, as a trans guy from a very tiny place I'm not used to it.

I think the thing that I wondered the most was if it was just sex or if she really loved him. I think why also came up a lot. I felt used. We were seemingly happy. People usually see me as a very emotionally present partner, so I recognized oddities early on but she made me feel crazy or paranoid or jealous for that. She kept saying it was just me being jealous of cis men. And since I do take responsibility, I regret how much time I wasted looking within on how I could make myself better. \n\nI felt foolish. We put our story as becoming parents on SM. As a trans person, it meant a lot to me that someone finally saw I could be a good dad.

I felt used that I was going to be used for the financial and emotional aspects of parenthood and this guy would not be seen as responsible for something he was clearly old enough to make. \n\nI don\u2019t know how easy I am to get over but I do know that made me feel dumb, cheap, and like a pawn in ways I hope I don\u2019t experience ever again.

I had an ex that did a lot of gaslighting very much like your ex (saying I was jealous of other women, that it was all in my head). And like you, I had quickly picked up on things that were out of the norm, but my ex would just say it was my autism and I was just insecure. Well, turns out he was cheating on me with not one but two other women. And I felt dumb and used just like you. I closed myself off from dating at that point and it took me YEARS to move past it. But during that time, I realized it wasn't me. HE was the worthless piece of trash, not me. I realized I deserved better. And so do you. I honestly never thought I'd find my person...I'm sure as a trans person you understand how hard that is too. But you know what? I did. I'm now engaged to the man of my dreams, who accepts me for me and thinks I'll make a great wife. And I'll bet dollars to donuts you will find someone who really will think you'll be a great dad.
