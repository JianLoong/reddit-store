It means absolutely nothing besides using what\u2019s available. It\u2019s not like the items got contaminated by the ex\u2019s lying and manipulation.", "NTA unless it bothers your new partner. Your ex is trash, everyone else probably knows this. She\u2019s just desperately trying to find some way to make you the bad guy. Who cares what she thinks.\n\nIf it bothers your new partner that you\u2019re using your ex\u2019s fire pit, sell it and get another one. Otherwise, enjoy some s\u2019mores.", "Unless you are using her old vibrator on your new girlfriend I don\u2019t know what the problem is. There was a washer and dryer in our house when bought it. Should we have put it to the curb and bought new ones?", "She left it. It\u2019s not hers anymore, it\u2019s yours. \n\nIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re dressing up new girls in her old lingerie she left in the closet lol. \n\nNTA", "NTA. As my mom always told me, consider the source.", "NTA The audacity of a cheater to call you a fuckboi for using a damned firepit.\n\nIt seems wild that she demands loyalty from her abandoned dryer after giving every Tom, Dick, and Harry a free spin cycle.", "Definitely NTA. If she left it, it is yours. Enjoying it will be the best revenge for her shitty behaviour.", "NTA. Your ex is bitter, petty, and immature.", "NTA. You are talking about appliances and furniture, not personal items like clothing, jewelry or sex toys. There's no reason to refurnish your house and yard just because she's the one who purchased stuff. \n\nShe sounds bitter because you are moving on with a happy life.", "NTA. Her attempt at a flex is not a thing. You're just falling for her shit-stirring.", "NTA\n\nDefinitely not your job to make her happy.  If it's not one thing, she just find something else to bad mouth you about if you are happy.", "NTA! She chose to leave those things! She is just running her mouth out of jealousy. Ignore her, sounds like you got out of that relationship with more than enough reasons!", "NTA but a this point what do you care she\u2019s saying to her friends? You\u2019ve presumably moved on so let her rant and Dave and don\u2019t give her your attention?\n\nI also think there\u2019s a big difference between household items and something more personal, like clothes. Like, if your GF was wearing her old dresses, that would be weird. But a dryer and a fire pit? Screw that, she abandoned it, it became yours to do with as you choose.", "NTA - that is honestly such an insane question to me, you mean like literally throwing everything in the garbage and then buying all the same stuff new? You would be ta if you did anything half as wasteful as that.", "Use it all bud its yours", "NTA. The ex didn't want the stuff. It was never used, and it was free for you. Consider it payment from the ex for killing the relationship and dump the new girl cause she is toxic.", "Info: does whoever is throwing a fit about this (your ex right? Not current gf I hope) secretly own a dryer company?", "NTA", "NTA. Not only is it now your property since it was abandoned for more than 60 days after being notified it was left, these are items bought for the house. They can be construed as gifts, and since it\u2019s been long enough that they were left behind, they\u2019re yours now. \n\nMaybe she shouldn\u2019t get so bent out of shape about a fire pit she gave up cause she got knocked up by her affair partner.", "NTA, she doesn't get to judge when she was the one mattress surfing during your relationship", "Lmfao I laughed at the frog dicks comment. Thank you for that.", "Yeah - I might think twice if they were sentimental relationship things (gifted jewelry being regifted to a new girlfriend).  But a perfectly good washing machine?  There is nothing relationshipy or sentimental about a washing machine or other small appliances.  It would be wasteful NOT to use them.", "Frog ducks and I spit my water on my keyboard \ud83e\udd23, and OP NTA", "Right? I think that\u2019s ultimately my question should there be a differentiation between items from ex\u2019s? For me there is. Sentimental items sure, but a dryer? That\u2019s not small and they are usually expensive. Of course I would keep and use that.", "Right. I left a whole house full of furniture when I left my ex. I was moving across country and didn't want to move it. I also didn't want to leave him with a three story house with nothing but a twin bed and a side table. I rightfully could have, but leaving it behind was mutually beneficial. It was all old (but still nice) shit from my parents downgrading their house anyways. I hope to God he kept and used all of it, cause tossing it is just wasteful.", "The timing of it was such that I didn\u2019t know she was pregnant and it was his. Even when she proposed, she knew she was pregnant and that I wasn\u2019t the father. So when getting her stuff, I think she left a lot of it because she felt guilty. Then has gone back on that guilt now that he doesn\u2019t make as much as me, so she probably can\u2019t have the life style she had when we were splitting finances. That\u2019s my guess though. I don\u2019t know for sure. \n\nFriends suggested burning some of it. I just threw away sentimental things when I was ready, went through the nursery when I was ready and stored that stuff, then donated/garage saled whatever I didn\u2019t want to use. That was much more therapeutic than burning it.", "She has at this point. It\u2019s been a couple months over a year.", "That\u2019s how I approached it too. I also wasn\u2019t the one that cheated. So my relationship is new and there was quite some months between. I think time has a lot to do with it as well. \n\nBut I was the one buying things like sheets, etc. and enough time has passed that a lot of that has been replaced anyways. But big purchase items? Why would I get rid of a perfectly nice firepit? And why would I go around my own house and say what I bought versus an ex bought? That\u2019s weird.", "Shit stirrers. \u201cOmg Beth he\u2019s still using your firepit! I can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t drag it out of the yard and bring it to the dump and then go buy a new one and install that instead. Oh and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the same dryer y\u2019all had!\u201d  \nMaybe they\u2019re all the type to burn everything an ex touched after a breakup.", "OP needs to weed those people out of their life. They're not true friends.", "Oh shoot, I read that wrong. I thought it was a new woman and not the ex that had a problem. \n\nI still stand on the NTA. If she wanted her stuff back I would probably give it to her, but her being mad that you are using stuff that she left is just odd", "No. We are all a part of \u201cthe LGBT+\u201c community in a small town. And every year, I have a Christmas dinner for community. People talk. So mutuals went to that and must\u2019ve relayed it because my partner was there. I don\u2019t think my partner was ever friends with her.", "I\u2019m sorry you went through that. It\u2019s rough. And people normalize it but the betrayal trauma from it is real. And I cognitively know cheating is 100% about the other person, but I haven\u2019t met someone who doesn\u2019t internalize cheating as their own fault.", "I answered this elsewhere. But it\u2019s a small lgbt+ community, I am somewhat of a known advocate. People knew about the cheating even though I didn\u2019t tell because she was pregnant, new guy was around, and I\u2019m trans (AFAB) so people knew eventually it wasn\u2019t mine. It became hot gossip. Because it isn\u2019t common and it just sounds like something in a soap opera. So even the people I\u2019ve parsed down in my friend group who come over for events at my house, talk. I kept away as practically a shut in for months but apparently that wasn\u2019t long enough.", "Yeah I feel like there is categories of things? I only have two ex\u2019s but I keep things like photographs in an album in the closet. Things I can\u2019t bring myself to throw away. Small stuff from her got donated or thrown away or sold. I couldn\u2019t stand to really look at it. But if it\u2019s something expensive like a dryer? Why not? And a built in fireplace? Am I supposed to just re-do a whole back patio? Of course I have parties there and dates there.", "My pleasure. Glad I could make you laugh. \ud83d\ude01", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t concern myself with the opinion of someone that not only cheated on me, but got pregnant with the person who she was cheating on me with\u2026 her moral point of view is\u2026 not good LOL\n\nShe sounds\u2026 salty. That\u2019s the irony of life sometimes. People that create a lot of hurt and pain, somehow find ways to twist the narratives to make the other person at fault of something, anything. Salty lady.. wants to be the victim one way or another. You would think she\u2019d be happy getting to live her life freely with her bd fool", " If she wanted it, she could have picked it up. So she's lazy too.", "It sounds like she\u2019ll talk shit anyway. And in the meantime, it\u2019s shockingly wasteful to replace perfectly good things.", "This is exactly my thought. Sentimental items would be tacky or weird to keep using. But notice she left behind the cumbersome appliances -- washers are a bitch to move, and I don't even know *how* to move a fire pit. If she has money, she probably mentally wrote off their cost as a convenience fee for not having to deal with them. She's just being petty and starting shit because she can. If she still really cares, it's because life with Baby Daddy isn't all that grand.", "It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a dildo. It\u2019s a dryer. For gods sake it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a super personal item.", "Reusing Underwear and Sex toys is inappropriate.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA fire pit is a fire pit. Regardless of who did owe it at one point. - Consider it that way: Anything you would have taken over from a previous house owner too is fine.", "I don't think the value really matters since she didn't bother to take them with her. I agree with other posters, using sentimental items would be in bad taste, but using practical household items like the firepit and dryer is just sensible.", "Soooooo she cheated, got pregnant, hid the pregnancy then tried to get back together with you and convince you to marry her so you would have to raise a child that wasn't yours....  And *she's* the one questioning your ethics?  Lol", "Well it's not like you didn't try to burn the fire pit", "I think the real question is why do you care what she thinks? She clearly didn\u2019t care what you thought when she went and rode some other guy.", "She doesn't care about the stuff, only shit-talking you. Idk why she would care after what she did to you, but I'd just ignore her and the gossip.", "\"Sorry who are you?\" \"i'm your ex\" \"the one who cheated right?\"", "Tbh it sounds like she left that there so you'd have to contact her to pick it up \n\nShe's isn't mad you're using it, she's mad you moved on and are living a good life instead of chasing after her (even if only to return an item)", "I feel like there\u2019s a joke to be made here with anyone who would repeat her nonsense to you. \u201cHey she tried to trick me into taking care of a baby that wasn\u2019t mine, I\u2019m perfectly happy to take care of a drier that isn\u2019t mine instead.\u201d\n\nNTA. Obviously.", "At the end of the day, she was a garbage person. Don't listen to garbage.\n\nEnjoy the firepit and the dryer and anything else you may have inherited. They're your items. How you got them is irrelevant in the grand scheme.", "Don't give her another thought. NTA. \n\n \"This got back to her with mutuals and she is going around saying I\u2019m a f\\*ck boy who reuses one woman\u2019s stuff for another.\"\n\nShe's 31yo, and acting like a high-schooler. She's making a fool of herself. Anyone that hears her call you a f\\*ckboy for using an appliance she left behind is rolling their eyes at her.", "I think the fire pit is sorta like an outdoor grill\u2026 and if I had a lovely functional grill at my property that someone left behind of COURSE I would use it\u2026 it\u2019s not like a grill (or fire pit) are specific to a gender, or a romance.. they\u2019re just cool household large gear. You are totally NTA (and the ex is totally TA).", "Thanks. It's tough because I know it isn't my fault, obviously, but there's that nagging thought that maybe I could've done things differently and it never would've happened\n\nWe have a child together too, which makes things way more complicated. She left our toddler with me, so I've had to figure out how to be a single dad. I can't just cut her off because of the kid, too. She always asks for pictures and everything, but the guy she moved in with was 10 hours away so she's only seen her child once in that time.\n\nIt's crazy!", "You can think of it as an apology gift from her for her infidelity.", "You are correct.", "How come you were doing a nursery if you didn't know she was pregnant? I'm confused.", "A lot of couples will start working on a nursery when they are ready or are getting close to being ready to start trying for kids. It's easier that way and less to spend at once because you get a couple things here and there and have it all ready when it's time instead of buying everything all at once."]}
