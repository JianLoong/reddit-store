I would think she would have better things to do since she now has a baby.", "Completely agree.", "I\u2019m not sure completely, but sentimental shared items she threw a tantrum and as she packed she said she was keeping this that or something else. I just shrugged. I didn\u2019t want to look at it at that time. Looking back, I should\u2019ve known it was happening. I keep remembering a day I came home from work and she said \u201cwe have too many photos of our times together on the wall, don\u2019t you think?\u201d And photos of us she took down, and put up photos of her and her dog. And a photo that made it seem like we were friends or cousins. That\u2019s when I should\u2019ve known. So stuff like that, she kept. And made note to me that she kept it. But I wasn\u2019t really interested in the sentimental stuff because it was all a joke.", "It\u2019s built into the patio area. I would have to get the patio completely re-done.", "lol", "No worries, I got that message loud and clear. She seemed surprised I broke up with her and wasn\u2019t willing to take her back. She even said as a trans person I wasn\u2019t going to be able to do better. I think people like that cheat as a power trip, and won\u2019t ever really be capable of deep, honest, mutual relationships. But when someone starts to smear me, and it matters to mutual community, in a moment where lots of people are cancelled then yeah, I start to care about that.", "No. She hasn\u2019t actually talked to me through any of this. After I asked for answers over a year ago, she ignored that, I never reached out again. Then she just\u2026 deleted our relationship on SM like it never happened. Then the sonogram was posted. She has yet to talk to me about any of it.", "Hilarious how you make it sound like you're using your ex's dildos. I hope not!", "You can, if both of you agree. Separately, or all at once.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave fun.", "I don\u2019t know what BD\u2019s deal is or what narrative she has told him. He would\u2019ve known it was my house and also my bedroom the affair at least once took place in. I left for the weekend to go camping the day she and BD moved her stuff. The new housemates I got said he talked trash about my PhD. Talked trash about my house, etc. so I\u2019m sure he is told some lies about what kind of guy I am to internally justify knowing he was the other guy. I also just don\u2019t get people like that, because if you are the other person who is to say she won\u2019t turn around and do the same to him?", "The above but would Add.. I gave ex several months to get her stuff after she cheated and got pregnant, she took what she wanted...", "People in our small LGBT+ community have met the guy and have laughed at how much of a \u201cdowngrade\u201d he is. I don\u2019t think about people in terms of levels but I\u2019m guessing by her own shallow means she does. She is getting it from gossip. Someone told her I\u2019m dating someone new. As I\u2019ve commented elsewhere, I do a lot in community and knew it was only a matter of time that got out.", "If you want to be petty and make a point, you could play her game. Make comments that she's going around reusing one man\u2019s stuff for another. Tell other people some other man is using your items.\n\nPoint out the hypocrisy that she's keeping your items and still using them and see how quickly she'll shut up.", "She's just upset about the you going out on dates part and not the stuff.", "That makes her more ridiculous than I previously thought she was.", "That's even worse than I thought. I was thinking it was a stand-alone type. If she really wants it, she can pay you IN ADVANCE for the cost of redoing the patio.", "That means it\u2019s not really about ethics. It\u2019s a tantrum. It\u2019s one thing she can tug on to make you feel bad. Don\u2019t give her the power.", "Ohhhhh mate that is awful. I\u2019m glad for you that you are well and truly done with that relationship", "Gasp she is horrible and I\u2019m soooo glad you\u2019ve moved on from her.  Just keep on enjoying your best life and let her wallow in her fucked up life.   I hope you and your new partner enjoy nice cozy warm pajamas and perfectly cooked smores.", "God she is horrible. It sounds like she is doing whatever she can to avoid taking responsibility for how badly she fucked up.\n\n1. She tried to marry you to hide her infidelity\n2. She asks you to let it go without ever actually apologizing\n3. She blames you for breaking up with her, rather than herself, by imagining that she is good enough for you even though she cheated\n4. You dating other people proves that you can do better than her, so she tries to come up with a new way to degrade you.", "NTA, but is someone who used your bed to bang their affair partner really talking shit about you using the dryer they chose to leave behind like that makes *you* a fuckboy? I can think of so many not so nice responses to that.", "I\u2019m AFAB and we were doing IVF. Which required lots of planning, counseling, tests, etc. I caught them having sex two weeks before our IVF date.", "My best guess (and it\u2019s only a guess)..once he found out about the cheating, she told him she was pregnant and it was his to try to keep him from leaving her, full well knowing it was likely not his. OP either finds out or figures out it\u2019s not his and makes the clean break.", "Lotta folks start building a nursery when the couple decides to actively work toward starting a family. It's very common, and has been for literally hundreds of years.\n\nI always found it a bad idea, as it only rubs salt in the wound if infertility or a miscarriage happens. But it is 100% a thing in a lot of places and cultures.", "Yup, we are at the probably gonna try for a kid soon stage and have a spare room we use for storage\u2026 it will have to be the nursery so even though I\u2019m still on Bc and we aren\u2019t actively trying yet it\u2019s easier to plan organizing the house without that storage in mind.", "Nope. She kept the pregnancy from me. I\u2019m AFAB and I would\u2019ve known if she was pregnant that I wasn\u2019t the father. But I would\u2019ve been the legal father if she got married to me. So I think her attempt at the proposal was to cover up who was the father, since she did it via affair and not actual sperm donation/IVF. I wasn\u2019t supposed to find out about the affair. I still think about her saying once \u201cI\u2019m angry you found out about the sex and came home early that day, I wish you never found out\u201d and she never actually apologized for the affair. She just wished I never caught her. At first I was like\u2026 what a weird thing to say? Then months later she posted her sonogram and at that point everyone knew what happened.", "This is so fcked up! Sorry OP! NTA those are your stuff, don\u2019t waste your thoughts on her further abuses.", "I am just *so sorry* you had to go through this forreal. Wow.", "I\u2019m okay. I didn\u2019t want to get into that part because I didn\u2019t want it to seem like I was adding unnecessary details because I think regardless of what happened. It\u2019s okay to use appliances an ex got. But I actually feel pretty lucky now. I realize as time progresses how much of a bullet I dodged and when it feels like she never got her karma for it\u2014I have to remind myself to focus on myself.", "I\u2019m glad you are ok, and that you take care of yourself! You definitely dodged that bullet, she can\u2019t be that happy if her mind is still on you. I wish you better luck next time and enjoy your home with the fireplace:)"]}
