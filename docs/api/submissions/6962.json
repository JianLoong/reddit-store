My dad wanted to help make our anniversary special and secretly texted my husband to see if he\u2019d be okay making a special dinner for me as an anniversary present. He lives out of state so drive up specifically to give us this gift and then leave for work. I usually make steak because bison is tricky and has to be cooked at a lower temperature, and is considered well done quicker than non-grass fed beef. I also really enjoy making it. My husband knows cooking is a way I de-stress. \n\nWhen my dad came over with 3 t-bone bison steaks I was really excited but super tired and told everyone we could eat after my nap. My husband and mother in law insisted they would make the steak for us and .. well I started crying hysterically. I told them it wouldn\u2019t be right since they don\u2019t know how to prepare it and it\u2019s expensive. I was afraid they would overcook without help since neither of them really knew what to do. After some prodding I went to bed but kept crying.  \n\nI came out 30 minutes later and I was pretty nervous. I couldn\u2019t sleep just thinking about it. My husband put down the t-bone steak that had been cooked to 170 degrees (well, well over what a grass fed bison should be cooked and well done) and my mother in law put ketchup mixed with worcestershire sauce front of me and told me to eat up. \n\nI started crying hysterically and couldn\u2019t eat at all. It was like chewing leather and the ketchup mixture was just the final straw. They were only trying to be helpful and sweet, but I was so hormonal and sleep deprived that I didn\u2019t handle it the best. I told my husband they ruined very expensive steaks and he and my mother in law said they were perfect and ate them instead. \n\nTo this day my husband brings up how I didn\u2019t eat the steak and I tell him I was hormonal and upset by the inedible steak. \n\nAITA for crying over the steak?", "created_utc": 1673329074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1081t1w/aita_for_crying_over_my_surprise_anniversary_steak/", "score": 441, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On the other hand your husband and mother in law were trying to do something nice for you and it didn\u2019t go the way they planned it or the way you wanted it but i think the gesture was still good of them, it\u2019s just unfortunate that they overcooked the steak.

Then laugh and hold up your pinky finger.", "NTA. In my books you get massive leeway around childbirth due to hormones, the physical pain/stress/exertion, lack of sleep - anyone expecting you to be entirely calm and reasonable in that time is being unreasonable. Emotions were high and I can absolutely see how it would have felt like an extra task you had to do to do it right, and then when they did it wrong it was just all too much.\n\nThey tried to do something nice and thoughtful but realistically it needed effort from you to be done just right, which you completely understandably weren't able to give.", "NTA I would have cried too.

And in terms of hubby and MIL, remember that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\n\nWouldn't it be great if this could become a funny family story that you totally own? How the badly cooked steak totally threw you and you started bawling, and your MIL who thought it could be fixed with ketchup mixed with Worcestershire sauce, I mean WTF? LMAO! Of course this would send you into a tailspin in the state you were in.\n\nI can be really pathetic and teary over small stuff when I'm sick, the first time my children witnessed it they were pretty surprised, but now it's like \"the time mom cried over her TV show not being on\", and we all laugh about it.", "YTA\n\nI hate calling you you TA because you had a pretty good reason for being TA but you pretty much answered your own question - \"They were only trying to be helpful and sweet, but I was so hormonal and sleep deprived that I didn\u2019t handle it the best\"\n\nYou can justify plenty of reasons to be an asshole in life situations but that doesn't mean you weren't an asshole.", "Poor you.

When I decided to switch to exclusive pumping after a few months he was the one who supported me and started feeding the baby every 2 hours with me while I pumped. \nHe brings this up because I don\u2019t think he fully understands the power of postpartum hormones and I think the whole situation honestly hurts his feelings since he was stressed as well.

This smacks a bit of DARVO to me \u2014 by insisting that she apologize he\u2019s trying to get out of acknowledging that he acted badly here.

To me this at minimum needs family counseling and maybe personal counseling for him to work on how he manages feedback.", "I think he used a probe. The thermometer has this guide on it and it says a well done steak is 165, so I think he was cooking to that. For a normal steak that you want cooked well done he\u2019s absolutely right.

He does really well with a recipe in front of him and for my birthday, for example, he goes all out. \n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever cooked me a steak before this time that I can remember, but he knows a typical steak is 165 for well done.

He decided to cook your dad's gift to his and MILs preference and didn't even check how you want yours :( \n\nHusband is ah for that, and he definitely has no right to keep bringing it up and hoping for an apology.", "The key here is that he didn\u2019t know. If you don\u2019t know how to do something you ASK. Or at minimum if he knew that you liked it medium rare he should Google what temp that would be for a bison steak. To cook it himself without being damned sure that it will make you happy is an AH move.", "NTA.

Hell, I'd be pissed at *any* time if someone did that to me with a good steak, let alone when I was in your condition.
