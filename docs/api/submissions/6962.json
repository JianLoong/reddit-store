He lives out of state so drive up specifically to give us this gift and then leave for work. I usually make steak because bison is tricky and has to be cooked at a lower temperature, and is considered well done quicker than non-grass fed beef. I also really enjoy making it. My husband knows cooking is a way I de-stress. \n\nWhen my dad came over with 3 t-bone bison steaks I was really excited but super tired and told everyone we could eat after my nap. My husband and mother in law insisted they would make the steak for us and .. well I started crying hysterically. I told them it wouldn\u2019t be right since they don\u2019t know how to prepare it and it\u2019s expensive. I was afraid they would overcook without help since neither of them really knew what to do. After some prodding I went to bed but kept crying.  \n\nI came out 30 minutes later and I was pretty nervous. I couldn\u2019t sleep just thinking about it. My husband put down the t-bone steak that had been cooked to 170 degrees (well, well over what a grass fed bison should be cooked and well done) and my mother in law put ketchup mixed with worcestershire sauce front of me and told me to eat up. \n\nI started crying hysterically and couldn\u2019t eat at all. It was like chewing leather and the ketchup mixture was just the final straw. They were only trying to be helpful and sweet, but I was so hormonal and sleep deprived that I didn\u2019t handle it the best. I told my husband they ruined very expensive steaks and he and my mother in law said they were perfect and ate them instead. \n\nTo this day my husband brings up how I didn\u2019t eat the steak and I tell him I was hormonal and upset by the inedible steak. \n\nAITA for crying over the steak?", "created_utc": 1673329074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1081t1w/aita_for_crying_over_my_surprise_anniversary_steak/", "score": 206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On the other hand your husband and mother in law were trying to do something nice for you and it didn\u2019t go the way they planned it or the way you wanted it but i think the gesture was still good of them, it\u2019s just unfortunate that they overcooked the steak.

Then laugh and hold up your pinky finger.", "NTA. In my books you get massive leeway around childbirth due to hormones, the physical pain/stress/exertion, lack of sleep - anyone expecting you to be entirely calm and reasonable in that time is being unreasonable. Emotions were high and I can absolutely see how it would have felt like an extra task you had to do to do it right, and then when they did it wrong it was just all too much.\n\nThey tried to do something nice and thoughtful but realistically it needed effort from you to be done just right, which you completely understandably weren't able to give.", "NTA I would have cried too.

And in terms of hubby and MIL, remember that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\n\nWouldn't it be great if this could become a funny family story that you totally own? How the badly cooked steak totally threw you and you started bawling, and your MIL who thought it could be fixed with ketchup mixed with Worcestershire sauce, I mean WTF? LMAO! Of course this would send you into a tailspin in the state you were in.\n\nI can be really pathetic and teary over small stuff when I'm sick, the first time my children witnessed it they were pretty surprised, but now it's like \"the time mom cried over her TV show not being on\", and we all laugh about it.", "YTA\n\nI hate calling you you TA because you had a pretty good reason for being TA but you pretty much answered your own question - \"They were only trying to be helpful and sweet, but I was so hormonal and sleep deprived that I didn\u2019t handle it the best\"\n\nYou can justify plenty of reasons to be an asshole in life situations but that doesn't mean you weren't an asshole.", "Poor you.

When I decided to switch to exclusive pumping after a few months he was the one who supported me and started feeding the baby every 2 hours with me while I pumped. \nHe brings this up because I don\u2019t think he fully understands the power of postpartum hormones and I think the whole situation honestly hurts his feelings since he was stressed as well.

This smacks a bit of DARVO to me \u2014 by insisting that she apologize he\u2019s trying to get out of acknowledging that he acted badly here.

To me this at minimum needs family counseling and maybe personal counseling for him to work on how he manages feedback.", "I think he used a probe. The thermometer has this guide on it and it says a well done steak is 165, so I think he was cooking to that. For a normal steak that you want cooked well done he\u2019s absolutely right.

He decided to cook your dad's gift to his and MILs preference and didn't even check how you want yours :( \n\nHusband is ah for that, and he definitely has no right to keep bringing it up and hoping for an apology.", "The key here is that he didn\u2019t know. If you don\u2019t know how to do something you ASK. Or at minimum if he knew that you liked it medium rare he should Google what temp that would be for a bison steak. To cook it himself without being damned sure that it will make you happy is an AH move.", "NTA.

Hell, I'd be pissed at *any* time if someone did that to me with a good steak, let alone when I was in your condition.

From my point of view I was hormonal, exhausted, and you had just disregarded my stated wishes and ruined a special gift from my father that I was really looking forward to. Since you keep bringing this up, it sounds like you do not respect my understanding of what happened. That's OK. We don't need to agree on everything. But out of respect for me and our marriage, can you please agree to not bring this up again and we can move on?\"", "NTA \n\nIt was expensive food that they didn\u2019t know how to prepare and you told them you would handle it, and while I appreciate that they tried, they didn\u2019t even look up how to properly cook it.\n\nThey sound like know it all, who tried to gaslight you into thinking you overreacted.", "NTA \u2018I asked you not to do something and you did it anyway. That is not a favor to me that is disrespecting my wishes, even if your intentions were good. All I asked was for a nap first and I wasn\u2019t granted that. I was exhausted and physically and mentally recovering and again despite intentions that made it worse. Please just listen to what I have asked in the future.\u2019", "NTA. Also next time he brings this up look him in the eyes and go \"I will no longer be entertaining this conversation.\" And talk about literally anything else. The weather, movies, anything. If he keeps coming back just repeat the statement and refuse to engage", "NTA. They didn\u2019t just go against your wishes and ruin your expensive steak, they also shat all over the effort your Dad put in to make your day special. You didn\u2019t even need to be hormonal to be upset by that. It was shitty of them and it\u2019s doubly disrespectful that it keeps getting brought up. \n\nI hope you show your husband these replies and he finally shuts the hell up about it.", "NTA Wait. You cried at the mere mention of them cooking the steak\u2026 so they sent you to bed and cooked it anyway???? And now they bring it up a year later to tell you that YOU were wrong???\n\nBasically I read this as you saying that you cared about something and them devaluing your feelings. They probably wanted to prove you wrong, which was arrogant. That type of behaviour is nothing they should be bragging about. They were not being \u201csweet\u201d whatsoever.", "NTA \n\nIf he doesn't stop briniit up, you need to start bringing up, \"the steak he ruined\". One a week, every week. \"Remember that time my dad got us steak and I really wanted it well cooked? Remember how you ruined it and broke my heart?\"\n\nTrust me, a few months of this and he'll get the message. \n\nEither that or show him this post.", "NTA\n\nWhen a person has really specific wants/desires about a certain thing, the kind thing to do is let them control the situation. Of course there are exceptions to that, but for the most part it's a pretty decent rule of thumb. \n\nYou know that saying \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\"? I always say the road to bitterness in marriage is paved with good intentions. So often partners get caught in the trap of thinking they know what you need better than you do because it makes them feel useful and it feels productive. Good intentions don't trump good communication!", "ESH \"hysterically crying\" twice over steak is over the top. Sleep deprivation does crazy things to us but damn, this is taking it another step.", "So no thank you for the thought,  the buying the steak etc, just a huge tanty [tantrum] ?? \n\nYTA, I can't believe you are like a dog with a bison bone you just won't let it go.", "If someone says don't do this for me I think the best I can do is actually not do it for them against their wishes", "Next time he brings it up, tell him he still hasn\u2019t apologised for destroying your special steak, and until he does you never want to hear about it again. Stop apologising for something HE did, and go on the attack.\n\nNTA and your husband isn\u2019t\u2018fantastic in every other way\u2019. By my count he dismissed your request to leave the cooking for 30 minutes, ruined a meal you had been looking forward to - that your father had driven hours specifically to bring you - harassed you for not eating the garbage he cooked, and has bullied you about it for a year. That\u2019s plenty of ways that he\u2019s not fantastic to start with.", "I am happy life is good in general for you! NTA completely.\n\n1. Crying may have been because of hormones, but the rest was just you asking your husband and MIL to respect how you wanted to handle those steaks. The heart of this isn't about a hormonal reaction; it's about simply wanting your wishes for this gift from your dad to be respected!\n2. Your husband and MIL were in what I call \"transmit mode.\" They had a notion that they would do what they thought would be kind to you. But they absolutely refused to hear or see or consider the information that you were clearly conveying - what they wanted to do was the exact opposite of what you wanted. It's like that joke about the boy scout who insists on helping the elderly woman across the street and won't take no for an answer... only the woman never wanted to cross the street.\n3. Your husband is butt-hurt that this 'kindness' he thinks he did wasn't appreciated by you. He is still refusing to see that what he did was not a kindness; it was willful, blindness to how he was actually being unkind to you. And sadly, he remains willfully blind a year later.\n4. It happened. It's minor in the grand scheme of things. It would be nice if he could actually see that he was in the wrong. But even if he doesn't, he can at least agree to disagree on your perspectives and drop the topic. Certainly, stop acting like you owe him some apology or he was wronged somehow.", "Sorry, no he isn't fantastic. He's being a jerk.", "Have him look up \u2018baby blues.\u2019 It\u2019s very common for women in the first two weeks postpartum to be erratic and weepy. I\u2019m not a crier but when I had my youngest son, I cried a stupid amount in those first two weeks.", "Jeez I hate when someone upsets you but expects you to apologise to them. It\u2019s very reasonable for you to graciously say that you appreciated the thought. Your husband could try appreciating your position more.", "I have never been pregnant, but I would 100% cry if my partner ruined a special and expensive meal I was excited for, for no reason at all. Topped with telling me it's perfect and then eating my anniversary meal with their mother would send me over the edge", "OP, why is it a silly thing for you to cry over but (ostensibly, according to him) not a silly thing for him to bring up repeatedly, a year later?\n\nThe baby blues hormone dump after pregnancy is completely unreal. But that aside, I don\u2019t understand why you weren\u2019t allowed to feel upset regardless when your wishes were ignored, on a special day, during a momentous time. \n\nI take umbrage with people sort of waving away women\u2019s \u201chysterics,\u201d so to speak. It was your anniversary, it was allegedly a nice thing for you. But they did it their way despite you articulating what you actually wanted. To repeatedly make you feel bad or silly for being upset is really shitty.", "While I don't  want to start a fight I would  also focus his attention on the fact that despite  you being  tired and hormonal and warning them  they still have  gone ahead  and fucked up the anniversary =this isn't  something  they should  be proud  of  despite  the good intentions  and it's better left in the past. Nta", "Jesus DARVO is the new gaslight these days. So overused and incorrectly so. I agree many posts on this sub are stories of abusive behavior, including DARVO, but this is not one of them. OP said this has been the only thing they\u2019ve argued over in the past year, and it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s asking her to apologize - more like it\u2019s a story he remembers and brings up from time to time. I think OP just needs to be honest and tell him that she\u2019s annoyed that he still talks about this, and to please stop bringing it up if that\u2019s how she feels. This is not anywhere near abuse\u2026"]}
