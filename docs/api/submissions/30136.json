My daughter is 6, I know she would be so scared being home alone for who knows how long. Not even adding that she would be trying to take care of a 2yo. In my opinion, kids come first.

Kids that age can get hurt in a split second when they ARE being watched.\n\nShame on you. You let your hatred for your sister take priority over two children\u2019s safety.

You did such a good job holding reasonable boundaries with her that I suspect you have support to recover from her abuse throughout your childhood.

Refuse to explain yourself any more than you want to with your parents. \u201cHer behavior is hurtful to me, and I cannot be around it. My wellbeing is affected. I am sorry that my need to protect myself makes it impossible for me to do favors for her, but it does.
