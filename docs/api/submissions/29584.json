My costume also is a matching costume with my girlfriend so we both don't want to change our costume since we have already purchased everything.  Am I the asshole?\n\nUpdate: the friend group does know about the situation now but nobody is willing to stand up to her/tell her she is being ridiculous bc they don\u2019t want to cause more drama and don\u2019t want to \u201cchoose sides\u201d", "created_utc": 1698164125, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fgkag/aita_for_not_wanting_to_change_my_halloween/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
