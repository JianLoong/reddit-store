Heck, my own parents made me feel like my home (2 doors down from them) was just an extension of their home. I felt like I was back living in my childhood bedroom, despite having to pay a mortgage. I moved away.\n\nHowever, I suggest you talk to your SiL about this before you jump straight to anger. If she was out with a friend and remembered that she needed to feed the pets, she may have thought it would be rude to make them sit in the car. It may have been an innocent faux pas and not her willfully disrespecting you.

It would be different if she asked if it was okay to bring a friend or two along since your husband asking her seemed kinda last minute (based on the knowledge provided), but she didn't. I'd recommend changing the password and having your husband talk to his sister about the situation/appropriate boundaries for your home.", "NTAH, I understand why you are mad, and I would change all locks and passwords .
