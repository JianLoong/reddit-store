I went to my sister's house for Christmas because, for every event holiday or family event (sometimes even our birthday), I have to drive to them. They won't come to me.  So I drive 45 minutes to an hour to see them on holidays and events. Since I am single I don't have much of an excuse to not go. Before we get to the main part let me give you a little background quickly.\n\nMy sister and I have a rocky relationship. She thinks she is perfect and never wants to change or acknowledge she is ever wrong. She has lost friends and gotten into fights with our entire family, to the point where she didn't talk to family members for a year. Another long story. When I had my second brain surgery to remove a tumor, I almost went blind in my right eye due to sharp stabbing pains in my eye and I asked for someone to call my doctors to find out what to do, as I was in too much pain and couldn't look down. She insisted that she was the one who called since she is a nurse and then argued with my mom, uncle, and aunt for 3 hours that I needed to be nicer to her and get PT. Then refused the call and stormed out.  So in the end I was in pain for 3 hours and my mom ended up calling. We went to the ER the next day and she refused to turn her ringer off as it kept going off and was causing a headache for me, as I just had brian surgery and was in a lot of eye pain less than 2 weeks before. So that led to an argument and I was the asshole since It was her work hospital and my doctors might call. Why her? I still don't know. So that was just once of many incidents that has made me not want to spend time with her.\n\nBack to Christmas, She acts like a child if you don't get her a gift, doesn't matter if you are unemployed and have no money or not.  So even though right now I am hurting for money I got her and my mom a gift. I show up and the first she says to me is why I didn't buy her dog a gift.  She brought up like 5 times throughout the 4 1/2 hours I was there. My mom gave me a Christmas card and it said I need to be nicer to my sister that she is a kind Jewel and caring.  The rest of the evening was fine, my mom's friend came with her son and brought gifts for my mom and sister. Not me or the dog and my sister said nothing.  I don't care that she didn't, just wanted to see if my sister says it to everyone. Then as I am getting up to leave, My mom, her friend's son gets up and my sister just sits there. So I say bye and Merry Christmas. Give them all hugs and then pat my sister on the back as she sits there and says bye and  Merry Christmas. Her response was \"You can give me a hug\". I said you can stand up, it is polite when someone is leaving. Then my mom started to yell at me that I should remember the card and be nice to her. I repeated that she could get up. Eventually, she got up and hugged her goodbye, and to the elevator, my mom told me to be nice to my sister. Then Have a safe drive.

I'd be done with her, putting her pettiness over your emergency! Heck, would have told someone. Your mom is also an AH for what she said on the gift card. Heck, no! Or is she just trying to avoid a sister meltdown?", "NTA.  She\u2019s obviously the golden child in this family.  Who expects gifts for their pets?", "Quick clarification, I don't care if my mom's friend or anyone for that matter didn't get me a gift. I just wanted to point out that she only gives me a hard time for not getting her or her dog a gift, but doesn't give anyone else a hard time if they don't bring a gift.", "NTA, but it's clear that in your mother's eyes, your sister is the golden child. Your sister's behavior is petty and childish, and your mother allows it. Even after your surgery, she couldn't act sensibly!!\n\nIt might be necessary for you to move forward and limit contact with your sister and mother. Surround yourself with friends who value and care for you.", "NTA. You're recovering with brain surgery which is more important than coddling your sister", "NTA\nSister is obviously the golden child", "NTA. You're already 41 years old. Don't you think you want to spend the rest of your life in the company of people you actually like?", "NTA. I hope you have considered moving farther away from your family and making new friends to spend holidays with. A brain tumor is a very good excuse to avoid this kind of stress and hostility.", "ESH\n\nSis is an AH -- obvious. And your attitude is also AHly -- insisting she has to stand for a hug? It'd be polite but why argue?  That's juvenile stuff (just like her, also.) Why do you care that mom's friend's didn't gift you? You didn't gift her. \n\nYour mom is keeping the real world away -- but the family is dysfunctional, so..\n\nAs for the dog's present -- that's kind of funny (though family members often do bring presents for family pets.) \n\n\nYou're 41. Accept that you have a dysfunctional family, work on gaining maturity, and move forward.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry your mum and especially your sister suck so damn much. Good on ya for starting to limit contact with them! Hope you\u2019re all healed up from your tumour and surgeries and that 2024 is your best year yet!", "She never tells my sister anything because my sister doesn't listen. Then it falls to me to fix it all. So I think it is to avoid a meltdown as they depend on each other. Also, I almost went blind when we went to the doctor who did my surgery two days after the ER visit he said if I didn't get my eye stitched that day, I would go permanently blind in my right eye, the ER doctors after 12 hours didn't find anything wrong. Even though the anesthesia didn't work and I felt every stitch as they stitched my eye shut. It was pure torture. When we got back home, as I was staying with my mom, my sister didn't ask if I was ok or apologized. She just went about her usual self.  I have so many stories from the last 3 years (when I had 7-8 surgeries)  that make me know that my sister is not a nice and caring person.", "Thank you for the response", "Lol my family does get gifts for my pets but I'd never expect it", "What\u2019s this resentment of you all about?  She\u2019s clearly targeting you for her ire.", "thank you for your response. Yes, I have started to do exactly what you are suggesting. I have a very close circle of friends I spend most of my time with. I used to spend the night at my mom's place for Christmas and Thanksgiving. Now I only spend 3 to 4 hours there and it will be even less next year.", "Thank you for your comment.", "Yup, I do, which is why I don't spend the night at their place and more and only see them for a short amount of time. They want to spend more time with me, I been spending less and less time with them. And eventually, it will be no time.", "I had a brain tumor removed around Christmas in 2003, and we used it as an excuse to not go to our boring family gathering.  \ud83d\ude02", "I didn't care that my mom's friend didn't get me a gift. I was just seeing if my sister who gives me a hard time about not getting her dog a present or her a present when I am broke and can't afford rent. I wanted to know if it was just me or if she did that to everyone. It was just me.  That was why I mentioned it, but Reddit has a character limit.  Yes, it is funny to ask but to treat someone like an asshole and keep repeating that it is only two dollars isn't funny. But thank you for your comment. I appreciate it.", "I have no issue with getting a pet a gift. But I personally would not give someone a hard time if they didn't get my pet if I had one, a gift. Nor if they didn't get me one.", "That is a sweet thing to do, but she sounds really entitled.", "Agreed!", "Omg just shut up.. your ick.. I hoped I sounded like a child because of that\u2019s what you gave.", "The golden child often does this, to her you are an easy target, time for LC/NC with her and your mum."]}
