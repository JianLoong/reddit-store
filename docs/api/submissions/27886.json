Let\u2019s call him Ali (25 male). This happened about 2-3 years ago. From the beginning I was uncomfortable talking about her new relationship with her. I didn\u2019t think that she was headed in the right direction with this marriage. Even though I didn\u2019t agree I knew she is an adult and I have to be okay with the decisions that she makes. However, after a period of time talking her relationship caused a lot of arguments and disagreements between the two of us. I had to set a boundary early on. If she wanted us to have a good relationship we couldn\u2019t discuss her relationship anymore. I\u2019ve done pretty well at keeping my distance from her situation. Although I have received second hand information from my mom as my mom is still willing to entertain her issues. I see a lot of red flags from what my sister has shared with me in the past about him and how he treats her. She\u2019s shown my text messages and voicemails where he berates her and just plainly cusses her out. Cut to yesterday, I receive a frantic phone call from her. She is bawling her eyes out explaining that her husband\u2019s paperwork was approved but that she needed a cosponsor because her income doesn\u2019t meet the requirement. She asked if I could cosponsor him. She was beside herself stating she had no support and just playing the victim card. I told her I had to think about this. But I did say to her that I did not appreciate the position she is putting me in. She knows I don\u2019t want to be involved but she feels I\u2019m the only one who could and would be willing to help since that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done all my life. I\u2019ve always put everybody else before me. I love my siblings and I do anything for them. I know I don\u2019t want to do it but I\u2019m afraid of what will happen after I say no. I\u2019m afraid of losing what little relationship I have with Minerva. I\u2019m afraid of the heavy feeling I\u2019ll carry around thinking I\u2019m the reason she couldn\u2019t fulfill her happiness. I\u2019m thinking about all the weird family get togethers. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: added Ali\u2019s age: 25 versus Minerva\u2019s 44\n\nEdit: I appreciate everyone\u2019s responses. I\u2019ve learned a lot from what you guys have shared. I can only hope for the best.\n\nUpdate: I am going to talk to her tomorrow. See what happens. She texted me today asking for my thoughts on the topic.

You will be financially responsible for him until he works for 10 full years, becomes a citizen, or leaves the country. They are both asking too much of you. Frankly, I think getting to the US was his end game, and your sister was just a means of making it happen.", "NTA Absolutely not! That puts YOU on the hook for years as his financial sponsor.  Even if they get divorced. You are his sponsor. Do you want this?", "NO WAY!!! For context my parents wouldn't sponsor my late-grandfather's caretaker from Jamaica for a Green Card. We absolutely loved her and she was a saint, so as a 14-year old (this was 20+ years ago) it seemed strange to me. But then my parents told me they sponsoring her meant they would be on the hook for any government assistance she required while she's here. Then I understood it. Note, we knew her for over a decade and STILL didn't sponsor her because who knows how good of a citizen she would be. Thinking about it still makes me conflicted, since we all knew and loved her very well and I don't think she would have made us regret it. But you never know.\n\nOn to your situation, do you want to be on the hook for this guy's government assistance if he bails on your sister? If not then you absolutely CANNOT do this. You are not being a bad person. Say that to yourself 3 times every time you feel bad for saying \"no\" to possibly letting this guy screw your life up.\n\nGoogle \u201cgreen card\u201d and \u201caffidavit of support.\u201d That\u2019s what you\u2019d have to sign as this man\u2019s co-sponsor.", "NTA.  You should not make the decision to sponsor someone that you don't want to!\n\nThe fact that what you know about him you don't like makes it even more questionable.  You don't want your sister married to him, how can you possibly sponsor him?\n\nThey are going to have to find another gullible American citizen to do that for him.\n\nWould it be an option for your sister to move to Pakistan to be with him?  If it isn't, then could we call this true love?  If she suggests that, will he want out of the marriage?  I don't know the situation, but immigrating to the US should not be a windfal lottery win for marrying an American.  (Besides everyone thinks it's going to solve all their problems and we all know it won't.)\n\nEdit: I speak as an immigrant myself who sponsored her husband - I am glad I did that.  But I was thoroughly willing to live in his country with him.  Later on, other people have asked me to sponsor them, and I did not because I know exactly what it entails.  Sponsorship is only for people you truly love and trust.", "It is a big responsibility to cosponsor someone's VISA... you would basically be taking responsibility for anything they did wrong while they were here because you ultimately vogued for them. You are NTA for not wanting to take on this big of a responsibility for someone you do not really know/trust.   \n\n\nIf you're worried about flat out saying no, I would figure out if there is ANY way you'd be comfortable doing this (requirements, discussions with him, etc.) to give it a chance, and use your judgement after this discussion about moving forward. You're allowed to say no, though.", "Nta . You don't want to be on the financial hook for this guy for YEARS.  Don't let your sister manipulate you.", "NTA. Please, for the love of everything that is dear to you, inform yourself what would be your end of this deal. I am by no means expert on US immigration laws, but co-sponsoring your sister's husband would lead you to become obligated for ten years (=40 qualifying quarters of work), or however long it takes him to complete that or become an US citizen.\n\nCo-sponsoring, also called an affidavit of support or form I-864, is legally enforceable and means you are financially responsible under the Social Security Act for him and any dependents of his. If he and/or any possible children end on social assistance, the state is going to reach into your pocket for reimbursement.\n\nDon't even consider that. You have the right to say NO, and you are right to do that.", "YTA for even entertaining the idea. He was very abusive over text message, imagine how he would treat her in real life. This could possibly cost her her life.", "NTA.  Please stay as far away from this as you can as you don't want to be financially responsible for this guy for years to come.  As someone already pointed out, this may just be his way of getting to the US.  If this worsens your relationship with your sister, it's on her for putting you in this position.  Sounds like she made a poor choice  but it has nothing to do with you.", "NTA. You are not obligated to co-sponsor. You are not obligated to blindly support an adult sibling. That being said, don't be surprised when your relationship with your sister worsens. \n\nShe is an adult who can choose a spouse and live with the consequences. She should have done more research on the process of international marriage and the details of co-sponsoring. \n\nYou are an adult who can refuse to co-sponsor and live with the consequences. \n\nIn a moment of vulnerability, she reached out to you for help and you said no. You have a right to say no. You have a right to be uneasy given the red flags that you've noticed. Despite that, this situation will shape your relationship going forward.", "and if Ali decides he no longer wants to be married in two years you are still responsible for paying for his needs for the next eight. If he God forbid abuses your sister then you are still responsible for him which puts your sister in the terrible position of not wanting to leave because you will have to still support her ex if he uses benefits. If you want to protect yourself talk to an attorney. They will tell you that you should not cosponsor for the protection of your family.", "Tell her you looked into it but can\u2019t afford the ten year sponsorship required. You are very sorry, but it just doesn\u2019t work money wise. Maybe she can get a second job to qualify. Perhaps she can find and approach someone in the Pakistani community to commit to this. Maybe in return for a work contract from him? Give her a list of Pakistani organisations near her and wish her luck. This way it\u2019s based on money, as anything else might help her dig in her heels and increase her possible anger and frustration over your saying no.", "NTA\n\nBut stand STRONG on this.  \n\nYou are putting yourself at risk by cosigning for him.  \n\nWhile I understand you love your sister and don't want to lose that relationship, this is really too big ask.  It also sounds SO suspect.  \n\nDo you really think he will follow through on what is expected and stay with his sister.  Given the age disparity, his treatment of her, and all the other red flags.  This appears to be a green card game and your sister and you, if you do this, are just going to be made fools of.\n\nYour sister may be upset, but see how he treats her/behaves when his coming to the US is delayed.  It may open her eyes.", "NTA.", "This could turn into a trap for you for the next 10 years", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to be scammed, she can be. But it is outrageous of her to rope you into that for the next *decade*. Tell her no and block her for a few weeks. She's only going to bombard with abuse and manipulation to get what she wants.", "NTA. I sponsored my husband to come to the US. Don't ever do it unless you really trust them. Also, this has huge red flags for the relationship. \n\nAlso, the income requirements for a green card through marriage aren't that high. It's 125% of FPL for your family size. If your sister's income isn't that high she's got bigger problems.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not a good situation, don't get involved. Your sister can move to Pakistan if they're really in love.", "NTA, please don't cosponser the man. Not only will you be put at risk having to be responsible for him, but I feel like he might treat her worse once they actually live together.", "I want to go with NTA but am curious as to what your legal responsibilities would be as a co-sponsor anyway?  It might be a graceful way to present your \"no\" if it puts you in a legal/financial position that you can't accept.", "Pakistani.   There is a chance that he could be involved in unsavory regarding acts against America.

Let her know you will be there to support her when she wakes up & realizes what an abusive relationship she is in, but under no circumstances are you willing to financially support a misogynist AH for 10 years.", "NTA.  I think you have made your decision, but I hope it is to not sponsor.  The legal implications for you are tremendous, and they are not something to undertake lightly.  Especially for somebody that not only do you not know, your sister barely knows (meaning, even her vouching for him is suspect). \n\nAnd given your stance to not get involved, this is absolutely going the other way. You will be tied to him for 10 years, and who knows what could happen in that time. It is fine for your sister to take that risk, but I honestly think it is too much to ask anybody else. I would never ask that of my siblings, and even if I did, I would understand if they said no. As much as you are afraid of losing that sibling relationship, she didn\u2019t think twice about taking advantage of it, so don\u2019t feel bad about saying no.\n\nWhen you do turn her down, just let her know that no matter what happens, she will always be your sister and you will always love her. She may balk at it, but I say it because it sounds like her marriage is not great and not sure how Ali will take her telling him she was not able to get a co-sponsor.

For that alone, you can refuse.", "You've worked hard, but has she worked at your relationship as well?\n\nI don't think she understands the full scope of what she's asking of you, and given your misgivings about Ali, I think you're right to step back and refuse. This is not a situation you want to get involved in.", "If she cared about your relationship she wouldn\u2019t put you in this position. You\u2019ll be financially responsible for him for 10 years. He\u2019s already shown he treats her like dirt so why would you help an asshole? NTA", "After reading the sponsor form that u/steve_french07 posted below, I would seriously think about letting Customs and Immigration know that you are not going to sponsor him (if that's your decision).  I don't know how desperate your sister is, but I have family who would think nothing of falsifying one of these forms with my information and signing \"on my behalf\".  It's why we're low contact/no contact.", "You really should be. You should tell her that.  If she has no one, its because of choices she made.  Don't make yourself responsible for her mistakes.", "Maybe your relationship with her needs to change.\n\nYou've always done anything she's asked, but has she reciprocated?  \n\nShe's a sister to you, but it sounds like you're a \"favor ATM\" to her.\n\nShe asked you because she feels entitled to you doing anything she asks--without the least consideration for how this might affect you when Ali shows his true colors.", "And for 10 years!", "125% of federal poverty level. \n\nFor a family of 2 he income requirement is around $25k/year (a few thousand more in Alaska and Hawaii).", "and if he does something illegal you are screwed will be on an FBI watchlist. Please don\u2019t take a step that\u2019s going to mess up your life. Just to maintain a relationship with a sister who hasn\u2019t been good to you. \nAnd make sure she doesn\u2019t bully mom into doing it .", "Yeah that wold be a no from me ;)", "This is a great point.", "Good looking out! I appreciate this perspective.", "Holy cow!  That was an interesting read.  Thank you for posting the link.  At one point I had thought about sponsoring a refugee, but didn't.  I'd never heard of this form or of the obligations a sponsor has.  This has made me very glad I never sponsored anyone.", "Blame it on the Aaaaa-auto-correct \ud83d\ude09", "NTA currently. \n\nBut please, for the love of God and everything that is holy, do NOT sponsor this dude. Trust your intuition and stick to your boundaries. Doing so would make you T A l.", "Honestly, even if he seemed like a great guy, you'd be crazy to sponsor him.", "I refused to sponsor my own husband until he made some financial changes that would allow me access to savings in the event something happened to his income in the first 10 years.  It took more than three years of marriage, a kid, and $100 to make it happen.  Don\u2019t sponsor someone else, especially someone who you don\u2019t know. NTA.", "NTA. Too many red flags. I\u2019ve seen a number of people suggest paying for your sister to live there. I don\u2019t think that is a good option, simply because of the abusive language mentioned.\n\nGood luck, and I\u2019m sorry you face this dilemma.", "NTA- \n\nWhen you sponsor someone you legally agree to provide that person an income at 125% above the federal poverty line... (about 25k a year)... and if you fail to do so that person can legally sue you to receive that same money....\n\nAre you willing to pay your Sister and your Sister's husband 25k a year? No? Then don't sign these papers.... and the fact that your sisters income does not total 25k for two people....but she's attempting to sponsor him... tells me you will be asked to step up and support them both for the next 10-20 years while residency, permanent residency, and/or eventual citizenship are established... and if they divorce... it still wouldn't free you from the obligation to support him at the very least.", "You would be making yourself financially responsible for at least 5 yrs. If adyer 5 yrs he's solvent you'd be off the hook until such time he was no longer solvent. I wouldn't do it; if your sister's finances aren't hood enough to bring her husband here you're potentially on the hook forever. This is too big of an ask when you think it's a questionable relationship", "NTA. Protect yourself. Sooooo sketchy", "My cousin just went through a divorce less than a year after signing one of these affidavits of support.  You DO NOT WANT anything to do with them.  They are extremely financially detrimental to you.  You assume full responsibility.  I know other users have stated this but I cannot stress it enough.  His lawyer said his hands were completely tied.", "It's like co-signing a mortgage. You'd be on the hook for the full amount if the primary signer defaults.", "Offer to pay for her to move back and leave if he\u2019s abusive, I would not sponsor someone though especially someone who has no respect for my sister and if OP is a woman good luck getting him to listen if he\u2019s not fulfilling his part of the responsibility or coming to the US", "She can\u2019t sponsor him because her income is too low, by adding OP as a co-sponsor their combined income would be enough.  It\u2019s not unusual.  But, I think it would be a bad idea for OP to take that risk.", "Good call .I had to \u2014or tried to -work with some Mid-Eastern men who refused to even acknowledge my existence .Despite the fact that they needed my rec.to access some much needed resources.If this guy is belittling your sister why would you think he would respect you ? NTA OP."]}
