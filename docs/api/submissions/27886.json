Let\u2019s call him Ali (25 male). This happened about 2-3 years ago. From the beginning I was uncomfortable talking about her new relationship with her. I didn\u2019t think that she was headed in the right direction with this marriage. Even though I didn\u2019t agree I knew she is an adult and I have to be okay with the decisions that she makes. However, after a period of time talking her relationship caused a lot of arguments and disagreements between the two of us. I had to set a boundary early on. If she wanted us to have a good relationship we couldn\u2019t discuss her relationship anymore. I\u2019ve done pretty well at keeping my distance from her situation. Although I have received second hand information from my mom as my mom is still willing to entertain her issues. I see a lot of red flags from what my sister has shared with me in the past about him and how he treats her. She\u2019s shown my text messages and voicemails where he berates her and just plainly cusses her out. Cut to yesterday, I receive a frantic phone call from her. She is bawling her eyes out explaining that her husband\u2019s paperwork was approved but that she needed a cosponsor because her income doesn\u2019t meet the requirement. She asked if I could cosponsor him. She was beside herself stating she had no support and just playing the victim card. I told her I had to think about this. But I did say to her that I did not appreciate the position she is putting me in. She knows I don\u2019t want to be involved but she feels I\u2019m the only one who could and would be willing to help since that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done all my life. I\u2019ve always put everybody else before me. I love my siblings and I do anything for them. I know I don\u2019t want to do it but I\u2019m afraid of what will happen after I say no. I\u2019m afraid of losing what little relationship I have with Minerva. I\u2019m afraid of the heavy feeling I\u2019ll carry around thinking I\u2019m the reason she couldn\u2019t fulfill her happiness. I\u2019m thinking about all the weird family get togethers. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: added Ali\u2019s age: 25 versus Minerva\u2019s 44\n\nEdit: I appreciate everyone\u2019s responses. I\u2019ve learned a lot from what you guys have shared.

You will be financially responsible for him until he works for 10 full years, becomes a citizen, or leaves the country. They are both asking too much of you. Frankly, I think getting to the US was his end game, and your sister was just a means of making it happen.", "NTA Absolutely not! That puts YOU on the hook for years as his financial sponsor.  Even if they get divorced. You are his sponsor. Do you want this?", "NO WAY!!! For context my parents wouldn't sponsor my late-grandfather's caretaker from Jamaica for a Green Card. We absolutely loved her and she was a saint, so as a 14-year old (this was 20+ years ago) it seemed strange to me. But then my parents told me they sponsoring her meant they would be on the hook for any government assistance she required while she's here. Then I understood it. Note, we knew her for over a decade and STILL didn't sponsor her because who knows how good of a citizen she would be. Thinking about it still makes me conflicted, since we all knew and loved her very well and I don't think she would have made us regret it. But you never know.\n\nOn to your situation, do you want to be on the hook for this guy's government assistance if he bails on your sister? If not then you absolutely CANNOT do this. You are not being a bad person. Say that to yourself 3 times every time you feel bad for saying \"no\" to possibly letting this guy screw your life up.\n\nGoogle \u201cgreen card\u201d and \u201caffidavit of support.\u201d That\u2019s what you\u2019d have to sign as this man\u2019s co-sponsor.", "NTA.  You should not make the decision to sponsor someone that you don't want to!\n\nThe fact that what you know about him you don't like makes it even more questionable.  You don't want your sister married to him, how can you possibly sponsor him?\n\nThey are going to have to find another gullible American citizen to do that for him.\n\nWould it be an option for your sister to move to Pakistan to be with him?  If it isn't, then could we call this true love?  If she suggests that, will he want out of the marriage?  I don't know the situation, but immigrating to the US should not be a windfal lottery win for marrying an American.  (Besides everyone thinks it's going to solve all their problems and we all know it won't.)\n\nEdit: I speak as an immigrant myself who sponsored her husband - I am glad I did that.  But I was thoroughly willing to live in his country with him.  Later on, other people have asked me to sponsor them, and I did not because I know exactly what it entails.  Sponsorship is only for people you truly love and trust.", "It is a big responsibility to cosponsor someone's VISA... you would basically be taking responsibility for anything they did wrong while they were here because you ultimately vogued for them. You are NTA for not wanting to take on this big of a responsibility for someone you do not really know/trust.   \n\n\nIf you're worried about flat out saying no, I would figure out if there is ANY way you'd be comfortable doing this (requirements, discussions with him, etc.) to give it a chance, and use your judgement after this discussion about moving forward. You're allowed to say no, though.", "Nta . You don't want to be on the financial hook for this guy for YEARS.  Don't let your sister manipulate you.", "NTA. Please, for the love of everything that is dear to you, inform yourself what would be your end of this deal. I am by no means expert on US immigration laws, but co-sponsoring your sister's husband would lead you to become obligated for ten years (=40 qualifying quarters of work), or however long it takes him to complete that or become an US citizen.\n\nCo-sponsoring, also called an affidavit of support or form I-864, is legally enforceable and means you are financially responsible under the Social Security Act for him and any dependents of his. If he and/or any possible children end on social assistance, the state is going to reach into your pocket for reimbursement.\n\nDon't even consider that. You have the right to say NO, and you are right to do that.", "YTA for even entertaining the idea. He was very abusive over text message, imagine how he would treat her in real life. This could possibly cost her her life.", "NTA.  Please stay as far away from this as you can as you don't want to be financially responsible for this guy for years to come.  As someone already pointed out, this may just be his way of getting to the US.  If this worsens your relationship with your sister, it's on her for putting you in this position.  Sounds like she made a poor choice  but it has nothing to do with you.", "NTA. You are not obligated to co-sponsor. You are not obligated to blindly support an adult sibling. That being said, don't be surprised when your relationship with your sister worsens. \n\nShe is an adult who can choose a spouse and live with the consequences. She should have done more research on the process of international marriage and the details of co-sponsoring. \n\nYou are an adult who can refuse to co-sponsor and live with the consequences. \n\nIn a moment of vulnerability, she reached out to you for help and you said no. You have a right to say no. You have a right to be uneasy given the red flags that you've noticed. Despite that, this situation will shape your relationship going forward.", "and if Ali decides he no longer wants to be married in two years you are still responsible for paying for his needs for the next eight. If he God forbid abuses your sister then you are still responsible for him which puts your sister in the terrible position of not wanting to leave because you will have to still support her ex if he uses benefits. If you want to protect yourself talk to an attorney. They will tell you that you should not cosponsor for the protection of your family.", "Tell her you looked into it but can\u2019t afford the ten year sponsorship required. You are very sorry, but it just doesn\u2019t work money wise. Maybe she can get a second job to qualify. Perhaps she can find and approach someone in the Pakistani community to commit to this. Maybe in return for a work contract from him? Give her a list of Pakistani organisations near her and wish her luck. This way it\u2019s based on money, as anything else might help her dig in her heels and increase her possible anger and frustration over your saying no.", "NTA\n\nBut stand STRONG on this.  \n\nYou are putting yourself at risk by cosigning for him.  \n\nWhile I understand you love your sister and don't want to lose that relationship, this is really too big ask.  It also sounds SO suspect.  \n\nDo you really think he will follow through on what is expected and stay with his sister.  Given the age disparity, his treatment of her, and all the other red flags.  This appears to be a green card game and your sister and you, if you do this, are just going to be made fools of.\n\nYour sister may be upset, but see how he treats her/behaves when his coming to the US is delayed.  It may open her eyes.", "NTA.", "This could turn into a trap for you for the next 10 years", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to be scammed, she can be. But it is outrageous of her to rope you into that for the next *decade*. Tell her no and block her for a few weeks. She's only going to bombard with abuse and manipulation to get what she wants.", "NTA. I sponsored my husband to come to the US. Don't ever do it unless you really trust them. Also, this has huge red flags for the relationship. \n\nAlso, the income requirements for a green card through marriage aren't that high. It's 125% of FPL for your family size. If your sister's income isn't that high she's got bigger problems.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This should be one of those moments where you say \"You're my sister, I love you. But I'm not doing this\".", "NTA and assuming you are in the US do not sponsor someone you are questionable about. You are responsible for that person and it can whip back on you.", "NTA. Co-sponsoring him will drag you into her mess.

No thank you.", "You don't owe your sister your support (even just on paper,) to promote this abuse cycle.\n\nNTA. \"You want me to sign off on how he mistreats you? Do you think its appropriate to seek that from me? How am I to continue respecting myself if I enable additional abuses of you?\"", "NTA.\n\nSponsoring someone is HUGE. You are not only financially responsible for whoever you sponsor, but *legally*. If they fuck up in the eyes of the law, *you* can be on the hook for it. You can be made to pay reparations for anything they do. **Don't do it**. Don't let *her* do it. This has red flags all over it.", "Grow a spine and say no", "NTA. Not a good situation, don't get involved. Your sister can move to Pakistan if they're really in love.", "NTA, please don't cosponser the man. Not only will you be put at risk having to be responsible for him, but I feel like he might treat her worse once they actually live together.", "I want to go with NTA but am curious as to what your legal responsibilities would be as a co-sponsor anyway?  It might be a graceful way to present your \"no\" if it puts you in a legal/financial position that you can't accept.", "Pakistani.   There is a chance that he could be involved in unsavory regarding acts against America.  If this were to be true the case, you could be in for a world of shit with our government.", "INFO: What are your legal responsibilities co-sponsoring this person? This will better inform the sub to reach a judgement.", "NTA. Do not sponsor him!!! He's only in the marriage for the green card and you would be on the hook for any government assistance he requested, even if he divorced your sister.", "Absolutely NTA. Let her know you will be there to support her when she wakes up & realizes what an abusive relationship she is in, but under no circumstances are you willing to financially support a misogynist AH for 10 years.", "NTA.  I think you have made your decision, but I hope it is to not sponsor.  The legal implications for you are tremendous, and they are not something to undertake lightly.  Especially for somebody that not only do you not know, your sister barely knows (meaning, even her vouching for him is suspect). \n\nAnd given your stance to not get involved, this is absolutely going the other way. You will be tied to him for 10 years, and who knows what could happen in that time. It is fine for your sister to take that risk, but I honestly think it is too much to ask anybody else. I would never ask that of my siblings, and even if I did, I would understand if they said no. As much as you are afraid of losing that sibling relationship, she didn\u2019t think twice about taking advantage of it, so don\u2019t feel bad about saying no.\n\nWhen you do turn her down, just let her know that no matter what happens, she will always be your sister and you will always love her. She may balk at it, but I say it because it sounds like her marriage is not great and not sure how Ali will take her telling him she was not able to get a co-sponsor. And she will need some support if things end up not so great.", "Say 'No.'  Practice if you need to, but do not do this.  If you sponsor him, you become responsible for him.

He treats you like crap and I'm supposed to join him in that circle?\"", "Given he is already verbally abusing her by text, my guess is he dumps the sister the instant he has a visa and her money.", "You\u2019d think he\u2019d be nicer to her until he actually gets in though\u2026what a jerk", "Ya think?", "I love this, thank you.", "There is NO way the responsibility can be changed because the paperwork you sign for sponsoring are between you and the federal government. Whatever you discuss with the person who gets the sponsorship is absolutely useless.\n\nIf the sponsored person needs health care, sponsor has to pay for it, food stamps? the government sues you to reimburse, you name it? if the government pays for it, sponsor is the one on the hook. \n\nIt has to be taken EXTREMELY seriously because there is no way out until the sponsoree fulfils the government's conditions.", "Vouched.

It's completely reasonable to say no and that doesn't make you the bad guy. She's asking too much.", "I think she's selling you a bill of goods. Her would not get approved if she needs a co-sponsor.
