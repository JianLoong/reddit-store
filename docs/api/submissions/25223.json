Juliet is amazing. She's kind, smart, respectful, ambitious, and beautiful but she has a sister, Olivia (30) that is a pain in the ass. \n\nOlivia has been raising Juliet for the past 10 years. She and Juliet are very close and, while she is nice to my son and claims to like him, I feel that she is very hard on him. Back when he and Juliet were kids, they went out and he was speeding. Life 360 keeps track of your speed when you're driving and apparently she was watching them on the app because before they even got to their date, she called Juliet, had Juliet put her on speaker, and yelled at my son to take Juliet home. She only let Juliet see him at their house for a few months after that then when she was allowed to go out on dates again, Olivia was the one driving. She just started letting my son drive Juliet a couple months ago. \n\nMy son's dad is getting remarried in Mexico. My son will be taking Juliet. They leave this Wednesday. Olivia has already had my son over to interrogate him about the trip but she texted him today that she needs the flight and hotel info before Wednesday and that they need to check in with her before they leave the resort. She also gave them crazy rules like no drinking (it's legal in Mexico) and says that the room needs to have 2 beds in case Juliet isn't comfortable sharing. \n\nMy son showed me the texts and I told him that she's being ridiculous and that he doesn't have to listen to her. Now Juliet is texting him saying he needs to confirm the flight and hotel info and say that they won't drink or else Olivia won't let her go. My son wants to cave in but I told him Olivia doesn't have the right to keep Juliet at home and if Juliet chooses her sister over him, that's her loss.

You really want to see Juliet pick her sister over your son? She\u2019s only 18 and leaving the country is a big deal. Giving your family members info on where you\u2019re going to be is vital. YTA", "I think YTA. Sounds like Olivia is slowly trusting your son and you're going to just undo all the work he's done. Juliet is going to choose her sister. And when she does, your son is going to blame you. Let him make his decision.", "YTA would you acting this way if it was olivia's mom or dad saying all this and not her sister who is her default parent.", "YTA- these are not unreasonable requests. Flight number and name of the resort? Why wouldn\u2019t she share that information? She also didn\u2019t demand they stay in separate beds, just that the room had two just in case Juliet feels uncomfortable. Would you rather she feel uncomfortable if the teenagers (yes, 18 is teenager) get in a fight? Even though drinking is legal, if they don\u2019t usually drink Mexico isn\u2019t the place to start. How long does it take to text itinerary to your parent (that\u2019s what her sister is)?", "YTA - you seem hung up on the fact that Olivia is her sister, but in reality she\u2019s much more like a parent. And you don\u2019t have the right to override another parent\u2019s decisions for their children just because you don\u2019t agree.", "YTA - It sounds like Olivia has been under incredible pressure, raising her child-sister as a young adult is a lot. Also, it sounds like Juliet still lives with and/or is financially dependent on Olivia - is that right?\n\nUntil Juliet moves into her own home, I think Olivia is entitled to put rules on her about not being in the car with a reckless driver of sharing her travel itinerary. If Juliet gets sick of those rules, it's HER job (not yours or your son's) to decide when and how to push back on her sister's parenting", "YTA 100%", "Yta the hotel and flight requests are reasonable. Also if your son and her sister are not used to drinking, the no drinking request is reasonable as well. You are sending two young people to a foreign country albeit a resort with a wedding where one can assume with minimal supervision.  While they are both 18 and can do what they like the girlfriend has asked for the information. Please provide it.", "YTA. Why are you actively encouraging your son to dismiss Olivia\u2019s concerns and disregard basic safety when traveling? You seem very chill about your son driving recklessly with someone else\u2019s child in the car. Not drinking in a foreign country when they\u2019re barely legal adults (and not legal drinkers in their home country), far from home, and not used to drinking, is not a \u201ccrazy rule\u201d - that\u2019s a reasonable guideline. Juliet is a young woman in a foreign country who barely knows anyone - it\u2019s smart for her to stay sober. And her bf is the only person she knows in Mexico - if he\u2019s drunk, he won\u2019t be alert to assist if she needs any help. Yes she should have the option to sleep in her own bed. Having your loved ones\u2019 flight info in case of emergencies is common and helpful. These are all common sense.\n\nOlivia is doing her best to keep her sister safe, and I imagine she is scared and has a lot of pressure on her shoulders being a step-in parent for her sibling. Yes she seems overbearing in her approach, and you obviously don\u2019t have to have the same rules for your family, but you should at minimum have empathy and respect for what she\u2019s dealing with. \n\nMy only criticism towards Olivia is that she should be directing her requests to Juliet, not your son. And Juliet is 18 now and should be transitioning to self governance - instead of making demands, Olivia should be informing/educating and trusting Juliet to do the right thing. But no those safety guidelines are not \u201ccrazy\u201d - and you framing this as \u201cJuliet needing to choose her sister or your son\u201d instead of looking for middle ground here, doesn\u2019t help anyone. If something were to happen to Juliet in Mexico there is nothing you could do or say that could ever reverse that. As a parent, maybe try empathy.\n\nEdit: Read more of OP\u2019s comments and changed my verdict from ESH to YTA, bc OP\u2019s AH-ness is really eclipsing everything else here\u2026", "YTA. Stop interfering in your son's relationship. His girlfriend is asking him for this information, and it sounds like he wants to give it. You're stirring up trouble where there doesn't need to be any. It's normal to share hotel and flight information with your family. It's not unreasonable to ask an 18 year old not to drink. Juliet is not your child.", "YTA. Olivia is not making unreasonable requests. Hotel and flight information is stuff you would share with family members when leaving the country. Asking them not to drink isn't overstepping either. Do you really want your son and his hg to get wasted in a foreign country?", "If your son\u2019s girlfriend is asking him to respect her sister\u2019s rules, then he should. That\u2019s all that matters there. \n\nYou\u2019re encouraging him to ignore his girlfriend\u2019s wishes and safety precautions while framing the issue as \u201cchoosing [the most important person in her life] over him.\u201d There\u2019s no reason two healthy relationships should force a person to make that kind of choice in order to take a vacation. YTA, by far.", "Yta. I\u2019m 38 and still give my dad my flight and hotel info \ud83e\udd23 I don\u2019t live with him but want him to have peace of mind that he knows where I should be if something goes wrong. \n\nYes Juliet is an adult, so she/your son doesn\u2019t have to listen to her sister, but are you prepared to take Juliet in when/if her sister kicks her out for not following her rules based on your advise ?

I wouldn't be comfortable with any of my dependents leaving the country without knowing they are least knew flight and accommodation details", "YTA - You are right that Olivia is out of bounds with those conditions. But, those aren't only Olivia's conditions, they are also Juliet's. Those are the conditions (flight information and a promise of no drinking) that Juliet is asking your son before she, Juliet, goes on the trip. \n\nYour son gains nothing by defying Juiliet, I don't understand why you are so intent on getting your son (and Juliet) to disobey Olivia.\n\nIf Juliet is buying into Olivia's conditions, they become Juliet's conditions. Its up to your son if he want to meet those conditions, not you.", "YTA. Unless you are stepping up to support juliet through college, you need to butt out.", "Info: how old are you and your son?", "YTA and pushing your nose in. You should always give flight and accommodation details to those you are living with.", "YTA - All of my nieces and nephews give me their travel details when they go away (all their mums died and I helped raise them).  \nI\u2019m in my 40s when I travel I give my parents a detailed list of where I will be and the flights I\u2019ll be on for the entire holiday (they are slightly over protective because they already lost 2 daughters) \nWithholding the info is just being petty.  \nShe\u2019s only looking out for the sister she raised.", "YTA\nHis girlfriend's GUARDIAN is making a reasonable request to ensure safety.\n\nYou are acting inappropriately. You are being belligerent to those telling you that you are indeed the AH. You are defending your indefensible actions. Are you sure you're the adult? You can't be... no sane adult would deny these very normal,  reasonable requests\n\nYou are definitely \"in the wrong.\"", "YTA. Olivia has been raising her sister since before she could legally drink. She is her mother for all intents and purposes, of course she's protective. It's a big deal for an 18yo girl to be traveling overseas with her boyfriend and without her own family. Don't cause problems with your son and Juliet just because Olivia is being responsible. \n\nBtw, I'm almost 30 and I still give my family itinerary and hotel info when I travel because why *wouldn't* I want my loved ones to feel at ease?", "Do you know, I actually like Olivia\u2019s idea of two beds, and the reasoning. Good on Olivia.\n\nAs for your son speeding, I bet he stills speeds. \n\nThe no drinking rules, I don\u2019t agree with, but perhaps that\u2019s because of how I was raised, and everyone I know. \n\nThink of Olivia as Juliet\u2019s mother. If Olivia is not used to Juliet being away with a boyfriend, like this, I can understand her concerns.", "YTA. honestly Olivia is great. she is balancing being a mom and a sister while figuring her own life out too. we don\u2019t know what all happened for her to end up in this position, so maybe there\u2019s an underlying reason she is this protective. i think instead of judging, maybe admire how much she loves Juliet, and that if this progresses further how caring your son\u2019s (mother/sister) in law would be\n\nedited to fix a typo", "I can understand why you think this but for Olivia she became a \u201cmom\u201d at 20. Of course she is making mistakes but Juliet doesn\u2019t see anything wrong. Your son needs to realize that her sister will be strict because she is so worried that something will gap to her only family. \n\nSome people are very strict and will not change and once someone makes a mistake (speeding) they have a hard time letting things go. In your eye she is being ridiculous but her she is making sure her sister is safe and doesn\u2019t know anything else. Olivia will\nNot change.\n\nYour son will need to accept this or move on to someone else. If he pushes the rules then he might not be able to see Juliet anymore. Yes, you will\nNeed to talk with your son and see where his head is and also have his father talk with him to give a man perspective. It need to be his choice but both parents need to guide your son so he isn\u2019t pushed to far and understands when to leave.", "ESH\n\nYou suck for complaining about Olivia being cautious about the speed at which your reckless son was driving her ward when they were children.\n\nOlivia sucks for not recognizing that Juliet is now a legal adult, and should be able to manage her own life to an extent.\n\nYour son sucks for not confirming the flight details.
