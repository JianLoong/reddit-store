I did that for a while when I was young (20-21ish), but then I realized I was getting screwed over; it wasn't just driving her somewhere --it was also waiting around for her to be done with whatever she was doing, or else having to come back to pick her up at some unknown time, limiting what I could do. She also wasn't necessarily paying me what she would pay for a taxi/Uber/bus, nor was she covering my gas.  Also, more often than not, she would say things like, well, now that I don't have to pay for a taxi/Uber/bus, I can take you out to dinner/pay this bill/use the money for this. What pissed me off the most was the assumption that I would drive her someplace. I would hear her talking on the phone, saying that her child would drive her, even though she hadn't asked me. I finally wised up and told her that her travel plans needed to be made without me as her driver. She was pissed about it, but I didn't want the stress.

Would love it OP answered. I feel bad for the kids", "Then go. Your own children don't need to see that kind of toxic behavior. The longer you stay around it, the more you teach them 1.

How could mom make the rules? If he has overnights ordered. Why wouldn\u2019t he just take the overnights on his time? Although, since he can\u2019t even seem to manage an evening of parenting.
