Admittedly, he has a strained coparenting relationship with the mom. \n\nShe is five and I picked her up to visit this morning. SO doesn\u2019t drive. \n\nWe had a great day together and had plans to go for dinner. He called the mother and said we had reservations at 6 and she could pick her up after. We had some very mild snow in the area today, and the mother asked my SO if he could bring her home instead because she wasn\u2019t comfortable driving. He told her yes, without even asking me. \n\nI too, am uncomfortable driving when the weather is less than desirable and not to mention, I had already driven half an hour there and half an hour back to pick her up this morning. Plus, driven us all around the city in the afternoon having fun with the kids. \n\nSo he tells me that I\u2019m now driving her home to which I say uhh no? Why can\u2019t her mother pick her up? And he says she doesn\u2019t want to drive in the snow. So I say, well what about me? You know I don\u2019t like driving in this either plus I already picked her up and you didn\u2019t even ask me. \n\nSO blows a head gasket in front of the kids, and starts losing his mind on me telling me I\u2019m being irrational and that I\u2019m ruining everything. He also had some colourful word choices for me. \n\nI packed up both kids in the car, and drove my step daughter home on that moment because I didn\u2019t want her to be involved in seeing her father treating me that way. She was upset and scared and told her mother she doesn\u2019t want to ever come back to my house. The mom isn\u2019t upset with me, but my SO is now accusing me of making his access to his child even more strained. I told him he needs to be considerate of other people and stop making plans for others when he doesn\u2019t have a license and that he should be asking me to do things instead of just assuming I\u2019ll play taxi driver. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nUPDATE: SO\u2019s parents think I\u2019m a total AH. They said I should have just kept quiet and dealt with it the following day instead of standing my ground and that I should have \u201ccut SO some slack\u201d.\n\nUPDATE #2: I have read everyone\u2019s comments, so thank you for everyone who took the time. I just wanted to clarify those who are insinuating I\u2019m exposing my child for TEN YEARS to this behaviour and teaching her certain behaviours. SO and I have not been together or lived together since 2014. We have only recently (in the last few months) reconciled due to what I perceived as changed behaviour. While my daughter has witnessed her dad being a TA many times over the years, it is not a home she\u2019s ever had to come home to and worry about as I have been a single parent for the majority of her life. We have had many discussions about boundaries and how we treat people when we don\u2019t get our own way and toxic behaviours that are not acceptable. Additionally, she does work with a therapist occasionally as a precaution more than anything.", "created_utc": 1668295939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytlscu/aita_for_refusing_to_drive_my_step_daughter_home/", "score": 6233, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She also wasn't necessarily paying me what she would pay for a taxi/Uber/bus, nor was she covering my gas.  Also, more often than not, she would say things like, well, now that I don't have to pay for a taxi/Uber/bus, I can take you out to dinner/pay this bill/use the money for this. What pissed me off the most was the assumption that I would drive her someplace. I would hear her talking on the phone, saying that her child would drive her, even though she hadn't asked me. I finally wised up and told her that her travel plans needed to be made without me as her driver. She was pissed about it, but I didn't want the stress.

I was picturing a 40 something guy furiously pedaling away on a BMX bike in a snowstorm.", "Right? Like since the Obama admin?!", "I am grateful for this phrase. It\u2019s way easier to use than explaining why I spent 8 years on and off a relationship.", "That poor kid.", "Lol, that would be his just desserts. That or walking through it.", "All driving lessons are one on one aren\u2019t they?", "So you are nervous driving in snow but you don't want him spending $100 to send his kid home safely with a more confident driver. Well, at least we know what you value more. A hundred bucks is nothing to get your kid home safe.", "OP needs to ditch the guy for the sake of herself and the daughter. Then hopefully make friends with the ex so the daughters can have a relationship!", "OP mentioned he makes a lot of money.\n\nThat is the reason why he treated her that way (so are the parents) and why she keeps going back to him.", "Thanks for clarifying. In the states, it different from state to state.", "Yes, it's known to be difficult to get away, and that is why there are shelters for victims of domestic abuse!", "OP stated in comments he has a DUI. So SUPER cool dude.", "Oh, freaking God.  So he\u2019s an alcoholic who screams at his SO if he doesn\u2019t get his way.  How attractive.", "I'm so sorry you had to live trough that. No child should ever experience violence like that. And I understand that you blame your mother; from a child's perspective that makes perfect sense. She should have protected you, but she couldn't. Again, I'm really sorry that happened to you.", "She\u2019s not new. It seems OP was with this guy first. They have a 10 year old. I think the ex likes her. She obv trusts her. OP and this guy have been on again off again", "No she could have. She choose not to. Dont get those confused. She is single now. Woman arent rotally helpless there are groups to help. My aunt and uncle would take her when they would fight and she would run back to him. My own dads oarentd even took her a few times despite them being her own exs parents. She loved him so she was willing to overlook the abuse even when it meant I was part of that equation.", "Wait! What? Omg you\u2019re right! This is a cluster f*ck. \nOP you need to end this for good. Why are you so willing to take his crap? You need to get away and find your self worth. If not for you then for your child. They need to see a strong mama.", "I used to be so bad about resurrecting zombies, then I read this somewhere, maybe even on Reddit, and it finally clicked: Stop going back to toxic relationships because you are lonely. That's like drinking bleach because you are thirsty. \n\nNTA, OP, for not wanting to drive in the snow. But if you don't get out of this toxic relationship now and get your kid out now, you are the AH. Believe who people tell you they are THE FIRST TIME.", "Same", "The one I saw on Reddit that sticks with me is: \u201cLove is like a fart. If you have to try this hard, it\u2019s probably shit.\u201d \n\n15 years of off again / on again trying? And an SO who screams at you in front of your kids? Definitely shit. Time to flush.", "First term, even!"]}
