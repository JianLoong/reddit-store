Why doesn\u2019t your SO have a license? Since he does not have a license he should be respecting your time and energy that you are using to help him with his parenting time.

Has he had multiple ones then?", "No. We are in Ontario. First offence is a minimum one year to a max of 3.", "NTA\n\nYou've already gotten plenty of advice to break up with this guy.  And that's good advice.\n\nBut if you stay with him, stop doing your SO any \"favors\".  For instance, his transportation issues are his to solve.  Don't go pick up his daughter for visits.  \n\nAlso, if you're paying for anything for him, stop.  Don't have joint finances and use your money for yourself and your kid.", "Wow. You have low self-esteem. Is there some reason why you don't value yourself? He scared his daughter into not wanting to come back. You only wanted no witnesses to his abuse.  Ridiculous.", "NTA. Notice stepdaughter\u2019s mom didn\u2019t blame you because she KNOWS what your SO is. She probably feels sorry for you. Your SO scared his daughter to the point that she doesn\u2019t want to go back. That\u2019s your life now. Do you want your own children to feel that way? This is more than driving in the snow. He  needs anger management. Don\u2019t allow him to behave that way to you alone or in front of the kids. If he is always abusive, you need to take the kids and leave. He didn\u2019t mind you risking everybody in the car in the snow and seemingly didn\u2019t ride with you. And does he not drive because he can\u2019t or is it because he lost his license?", "OP, you are aware of the situation you\u2019re in and know the right thing to do. You\u2019re jusy trying to convince yourself otherwise because you have a child with him. NTA but you will be if you stay with him.", "So, let's see:\n\n1.) SO lost his license for a DUI, got a 3 year suspension (even though a first offense is usually a year, which you didn't seem to find odd) and makes you drive him everywhere.\n\n2.) SO got a girl pregnant while you were on a break/broken up, and for some reason you got back together and are now taking care of this child on his days.\n\n3.) SO, without asking you, agrees for YOU to drive HIS child back to the mother in inclement weather.\n\n4.) When you object, SO \"blows a head gasket\" and starts screaming at you IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN using what I'm guessing would be swear words, which frightens the 5-year-old so badly that she tells her mother that she never wants to back to your house.\n\nYou've not mentioned anything about this, but is this guy employed? If so, are you expected to shuttle him back and forth to work as well? What exactly is he bringing into this relationship besides more work for you and verbal abuse?\n\nNTA for this but Y T A big time for keeping this guy around.", "Nta but you did the correct measures by taking the kids out. But really you have to admit that your SO does have anger issues and also it's not your responsibility to do pickups and drop offs for your stepdaughter  and by right it shouldn't be the bio moms responsibility either since your husband gotten a DUI. He needs to figure out a way to handle his responsibility.", "NTA. I think it's time to tell your SO and his ex that you're no longer doing pick-up/drop off. They need to figure out an arrangement that's not dependent on you. You don't care how it's done so long as you're not the one doing the driving. If SO has to beg for a ride from a relative or buddy, so be it.", "NTA, you know he doesn't drive, leave his ass.\n\nHe is not treating you like an equal and he is scaring the kids. He should no longer be around", "NTA but you would be if you stayed with him.", "NTA \n\nWait, so you still drove her home??? You need to ditch this guy and stop wasting your time being his chauffeur. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t he have a car? Or a license?", "NTA Your Husband is beyond inconsiderate, and seems to be putting the other moms needs before yours. I wouldn't want to be considered less important than her either.", "NTA- DUMP THAT GUY! He sounds like a Grade A loser! Your comments - The on and off again, with kids in-between, losing his license to a DUI (meaning he probably had multiple), scaring his children like that, and talking to you like trash. Why are you with him?! Time to move on, the signs couldn\u2019t be clearer.", "YTA for being with him and doing what he says.", "NTA I read a comment you made about being on and off with him since 2008, be off again and keep it that way! He doesn\u2019t take your feelings into consideration, then when you get upset he verbally abuses you in front of the kids?! Is this the life you want your child to grow up in?

He knew he could bully you into doing it, and he didn't care how you felt about it.", "He just keeps getting more impressive.", "Cool, now make this time an off because you're 10 year old deserves better.", "INFO: Wait your kid with your current partner is older than the kid your partner has with an ex?", "Why does he not have a driver's license?", "So you and the 10 year old went back home to that after dropping off the step daughter? You know your 10 year old is internalizing all this, right? Normalizing it every day that they live in it.  You cared enough to get your stepdaughter out, now do the same for you and your kid.", "Why are you okay with raising a child witnessing such an unhealthy relationship?\n\nESH you guys need to get it together. You definitely should not be a couple.", "Yes.", "This is what I want to know. AITA is filled with people who don't drive and expect others to not only cover the cost of vehicle, registration, insurance and gas...they want others to give up their free time and drive them around.\n\nHow do they justify this?", "He was not here when I got home and I don\u2019t foresee him returning anytime soon.", "The sex can't possibly be good enough to justify this relationship.", "My mother, who has anxiety about driving, used to justify it by saying she was going to spend the money on a taxi/Uber/bus anyway, but if I drive her, she'd just give it to me. I did that for a while when I was young (20-21ish), but then I realized I was getting screwed over; it wasn't just driving her somewhere --it was also waiting around for her to be done with whatever she was doing, or else having to come back to pick her up at some unknown time, limiting what I could do. She also wasn't necessarily paying me what she would pay for a taxi/Uber/bus, nor was she covering my gas.  Also, more often than not, she would say things like, well, now that I don't have to pay for a taxi/Uber/bus, I can take you out to dinner/pay this bill/use the money for this. What pissed me off the most was the assumption that I would drive her someplace. I would hear her talking on the phone, saying that her child would drive her, even though she hadn't asked me. I finally wised up and told her that her travel plans needed to be made without me as her driver. She was pissed about it, but I didn't want the stress. Now, years later, she has my in-laws drive her everywhere. I don't know if she offers them gas money or not.", "Well thank god for small favors.  I recommend a change the locks party while he\u2019s out.", "Why on Earth is this guy still around your kid? You should be doing like what his other ex is done and is fighting to keep this guy away.", "Why are you lying for him?\n\nYou are mistreating your child by staying with this man. He is a drinker, he has drunk and drive before he only just got caught that one time. He's still drinks. He's a drinker", "He got classed as an alcoholic because he sounds like a dry drunk. Why would you be with someone who treats you like this? You deserve so much better.", "> I\u2019m not sure how he got classified as an alcoholic here.\n\nProbably the uncontrollable rage in front of the children combined with his DUI", "His actions scream alcoholic. He doesn\u2019t need to be drinking to exhibit the behaviors."]}
