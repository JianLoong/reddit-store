Admittedly, he has a strained coparenting relationship with the mom. \n\nShe is five and I picked her up to visit this morning. SO doesn\u2019t drive. \n\nWe had a great day together and had plans to go for dinner. He called the mother and said we had reservations at 6 and she could pick her up after. We had some very mild snow in the area today, and the mother asked my SO if he could bring her home instead because she wasn\u2019t comfortable driving. He told her yes, without even asking me. \n\nI too, am uncomfortable driving when the weather is less than desirable and not to mention, I had already driven half an hour there and half an hour back to pick her up this morning. Plus, driven us all around the city in the afternoon having fun with the kids. \n\nSo he tells me that I\u2019m now driving her home to which I say uhh no? Why can\u2019t her mother pick her up? And he says she doesn\u2019t want to drive in the snow. So I say, well what about me? You know I don\u2019t like driving in this either plus I already picked her up and you didn\u2019t even ask me. \n\nSO blows a head gasket in front of the kids, and starts losing his mind on me telling me I\u2019m being irrational and that I\u2019m ruining everything. He also had some colourful word choices for me. \n\nI packed up both kids in the car, and drove my step daughter home on that moment because I didn\u2019t want her to be involved in seeing her father treating me that way. She was upset and scared and told her mother she doesn\u2019t want to ever come back to my house. The mom isn\u2019t upset with me, but my SO is now accusing me of making his access to his child even more strained. I told him he needs to be considerate of other people and stop making plans for others when he doesn\u2019t have a license and that he should be asking me to do things instead of just assuming I\u2019ll play taxi driver. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1668295939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytlscu/aita_for_refusing_to_drive_my_step_daughter_home/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He could have called back and asked if the daughter could stay the night, or said that you couldn't drive her back after all, so what now? \n\nTheory- if his custody relationship is very strained, maybe he was afraid to refuse the mother's request? It's not an excuse for yelling, though.", "NTA. He should have asked you first. And speaking to you like that in-front of the children makes him double the AH.", "NTA. Although I think the more pressing matter here is how he treated you and spoke to you when you said no.", "NTA but your SO definitely is for having that kind of confrontation in front of the kiddos.", "NTA. Why doesn\u2019t your SO have a license? Since he does not have a license he should be respecting your time and energy that you are using to help him with his parenting time. He needs to own his behavior in terms of his daughter not wanting to come. He is the one that was yelling. Good on you for sticking up for yourself. He shouldn\u2019t be offering without", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like he one) doesn't consider your feelings and two) took his frustration out on you and I imagine that probably isn't the first time. His daughter doesn't want to come back because he scared her, I would suggest you emphasize that and tell him his reaction and general behavior isn't acceptable. Also, he can work towards getting a license or finding alternative transportation methods.", "NTA but you really need to mmtalk about this not just with him but to his ex as well", "Info: does he not know how to drive and doesn\u2019t have a license or is he not allowed to drive and doesn\u2019t have a license because it was taken away?", "Of course you're NTA.  Maybe we're missing info, but he sounds pretty immature.", "Nope NTA. He made it harder for him to see his daughter. He scared her. He doesn't drive. You don't commit other people to running your errands.", "NTA. Ditch the bum.", "NTA your significant other is a significant AH.

In less than desirable conditions that you don't like? I choose to render no verdict", "It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s all on him for not getting a license like what If there was an emergency and you weren\u2019t there?
