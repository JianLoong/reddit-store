I did go a few times w my brother who taught me quite a bit. I am skinny w/ super long limbs. I was using a machine the same way I use it each week, and a super jacked guy was looking at me funny, more like staring. He came and corrected what I was doing and said isn't it supposed to be this way? I said ok noted thnx, I am trying to hit my back with it to help with my physio goals, and put my earphones back in. I kept on w/ my workout, self conscious now hes staring to see if Im doing it right. I got uncomfortable & just packed up. As im leaving he says \"I was TRYING to let you know its like this \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" I said Ok. And walked away.\n\nI find it rude to correct someone when everyones body is different. This has happened more than once with another guy, so perhaps I am not doing everything right, and of course ppl know more than me. I didn't get the vibe they were trying to hit on me but genuinely they seemed annoyed and like they know it all so they can't stand to watch me. But if I am already not receptive to talking about it the first time, why can't ppl just mind their own business? I am not hurting myself or anyone else and what I have been doing has been helping with my back issues. Was he rude or was I rude by dismissing him? Men approach me a fair amount, I just have an approachable looking face I guess. So I may be extra annoyed for always having to be nice when I don't really feel like talking to people. I find women mind their own business more, at least at my gym.\n\nIt upsets me/was embarrassing and makes me not want to go to the gym. Im not the most coordinated but I don't want to be stared at. As I left he also did not look happy..he looked upset. So now I feel like I offended him as well and it was just a really negative interaction since I was not very friendly. As a super slim woman, I find people already stare at me like I look like I don't belong there as most people there are of shorter and super muscular body types. I think some exercises might look different for me as I am hypermobile as well.\n\nTldr; Guy who knows more about fitness at the gym stopped me to tell me im doing it wrong more than once. I was really dismissive to his advice and didn't feel like talking.

You can easily learn from watching a video on YouTube. Just look up proper technique for lateral pulldown. \n\nI really injured my rotator cuff doing them incorrectly over 2 decades ago.

He backed off after you told him you didn't care and didn't interrupt you again. The only person you're going to hurt is yourself.

Like if you\u2019re in the gym and not experienced and someone offers advice you should listen. As someone who is a college athlete I still listen to  advice from the local powerlifters. Sure it may seem like they are ego tripping but most of the time they genuinely want what\u2019s best for you. Yes some dudes are asses but you just being an ass when someone looks out for you is kinda corny. \nAlso the fact this isn\u2019t the first time it\u2019s happened tells me that you probably don\u2019t have good form at all which is how you get injured. Just because until now you\u2019ve done something wrong and it hasn\u2019t caused injuries doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t. I trained an event wrong for months and eventually it caught up to me causing me to need physical rehabs for half a year. So please actually listen when someone gives advice before you do get hurt even if it hurts your pride.\n\nEdit: I also just noticed your different bodies comment and that\u2019s also silly my mother who is 56 who has a completely different build than me TRAINS IN THE SAME FORM AS ME. So please don\u2019t act like you know what you don\u2019t know I\u2019m begging of you.
