She won't die. course this is an unhealthy way to go about things.\n\nI think you two should communicate. Instead of having them in 2 seperate areas, how about you both agree on one spot to put them, whether both in the room you frequent or both in the living room?\n\nBut, I am partial. I love taxidermy and oddities. My mother and father are against it, but we agreed that instead of all over, I can keep it all in my room and only in my room. Sure, they dislike it, but since it's my space, they know it's my choice on how to decorate. Since this compromise worked for me, I think it could work for you two since she dislikes it and you like it (and even have a great story for the pieces too that bring you joy from the sounds of it!).

I think people should be able to eat meat without being shamed for not wanting to sleep with a dead animals' head looking at them. Also, its the wife's house? She's already compromising with the deer being in the house 365 days every other year even tho she doesn't like it. I would say its a small ask.", "[removed]", "It\u2019s his wife\u2019s house as well and she doesn\u2019t like the heads around, why is OPs comfort the only one that matters?", "His wife hates it too. The room doubles as a guest room, and wife wants it taken down.\n\nOp basically said he'd still use the room daily while it is in use as a guest room.", "I mean maybe or maybe he didn't think it relevant since he had said it was a great memory but I am curious if you're right or not lol", "She literally doesn't go in the room to even change the sheets on the bed.  I think that's more than \"doesn't like it\".  It would be one thing if both partners enjoyed it and it was in a common area of the house, but it's in the literal guest room.  A room intended for guests.  I don't think it's unreasonable to remove something that would make your guest uncomfortable from the room they will be occupying for the duration of their stay.  \n\nAlso, there is no reason to call that woman a nag.  It's sexist and dismissive language.  She is allowed to not enjoy what you enjoy in your home.  I personally don't care either way about taxidermy, but I do think that both partners should get a say about what their home looks like and contains and that they should both be comfortable.  I don't think you should decorate with deer heads if your partner doesn't like them, any more than I think you should decorate with neon floral wallpaper if your partner doesn't like it.", "The sister didn't ask tho, the wife who lives there did. He's not doing it for the sister he would be doing it for his wife. The sister might have a phobia of once living animals being near her, we dk. Maybe the wife REALLY wants the sister to come and stay and also be comfy. But it is why I said I think he is both NTA and YTA because one hand it is his house on the other it's also the wife and it may not be the sisters idea first place", "Maybe compromise and find something to cover the heads while the sister is around personally if I was him I'd buy a man cave and dare my wife to say anything (I mean if I was her spouse that's what I would do I am a woman married to a man so it doesn't work here lol)", "Yes, weirdly, a lot of people do in fact struggle to sleep with the severed head of something over their bed.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

And she doesn\u2019t like his taxidermied deer heads. As soon as she hounds him in to moving them for SIL, she will nag until he agrees to not rehang them.\n\nI despise trophy hunters. It\u2019s a disgusting gutless practice to me because the animal goes to waste, the Hunter only cares about his head trophy.\n\nBut\u2026 it\u2019s still his house where he hung his hunting trophies, and that is his right. Why should his SIL walk into his home and tell him how to decorate it? If she doesn\u2019t like his decorations in his house then she can stay in a hotel. They don\u2019t have deer heads hanging in holiday inn rooms.", "If he works out every day then yes he would still be using the room, even with a guest there. The guest room is also his workout room.", "Its the classy way of doing it, yes. But some less dedicated decorators lower themselves to just a clown nose.", "A lot of people that didnt grow up around hunting/farm culture.", "All hunters I know take the head to the taxidermist and have the rest of the animal processed into meat for eating. I\u2019d assume that scenario before saying the \u201canimal goes to waste.\u201d  Most hunters have a code to eat what they kill. The food does not go to waste.", "But why has he forced them on the wall in the first place and keeps ignoring his wife's discomfort, seems like he refuses to even properly communicate about it. This is all just going his way now, instead of them finding a compromise like deers stay in spaces that are just used by him like workout room, and if a guest uses the room aka he won't go there to see it anyhow, it might be moved if the guests are uncomfortable with it too. This way he gets to enjoy his carcasses but without bothering others.", ">it\u2019s a disgusting gutless practice to me because the animal goes to waste\n\nHow are you defining trophy hunting? Because if you mean \u201cjust kill it for the antlers and waste everything,\u201d then it\u2019s very doubtful OP meets that definition, because very few people do. Wasting the carcass is illegal in basically any society with any hunting regulations. In my state even leaving too much meat on the bones qualifies as wanton waste, and the minimum punishment is a week in jail and a fine if $2500. They can (and will) seize all equipment you used to go hunting with too. That means your gun, vehicle, boat or plane even if you used one. Hell, you can be charged just for packing the antlers out first, even if you fully intended to go back for the carcass. If a trooper catches you with the head back at your vehicle without the entire carcass as well, you\u2019re having a bad day. \n\nSo if your definition of trophy hunting inherently requires wanton waste, it\u2019s not legal and you\u2019re just describing people committing crimes. If you\u2019re talking about people legally hunting and selecting the biggest animal then that means they\u2019re not wasting the carcass.", "I grew up around hunting culture. I still hate the head mounts. Gave me nightmares as a kid. They have a full cougar in their basement living room now that doesn't bother me but my bro had a friend staying for the holidays that booked a hotel room because it bothered him so much.", "I grew up in hunting culture, I own rifles and guns and I still get freaked the hell out at night by mounts in the wall. They absolutely scare me at night and the way minimal light hits their unblinking staring eyes. Day? No issues. Night? Demon creatures.", "\u201cMost hunters have a code to eat what they kill.\u201d\n\nKey word there is \u201cmost\u201d. Not \u201cAll.\u201d\n\nNot all hunters eat there kill. Some really are in it only for the trophy. \n\nSince OP doesn\u2019t specify I allowed my own disdain for hunting to cloud the context of the previous reply.", "And if he was only allowed to put his deer heads in his workout/guest room and there was a guest in the house, where would you propose he move the heads then?\n\nAt some point they both need to figure it out so that the heads are left where they are and both are happy with the outcome."]}
