She won't die. course this is an unhealthy way to go about things.\n\nI think you two should communicate. Instead of having them in 2 seperate areas, how about you both agree on one spot to put them, whether both in the room you frequent or both in the living room?\n\nBut, I am partial. I love taxidermy and oddities. My mother and father are against it, but we agreed that instead of all over, I can keep it all in my room and only in my room. Sure, they dislike it, but since it's my space, they know it's my choice on how to decorate. Since this compromise worked for me, I think it could work for you two since she dislikes it and you like it (and even have a great story for the pieces too that bring you joy from the sounds of it!).
