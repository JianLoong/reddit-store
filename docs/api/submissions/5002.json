She won't die. course this is an unhealthy way to go about things.\n\nI think you two should communicate. Instead of having them in 2 seperate areas, how about you both agree on one spot to put them, whether both in the room you frequent or both in the living room?\n\nBut, I am partial. I love taxidermy and oddities. My mother and father are against it, but we agreed that instead of all over, I can keep it all in my room and only in my room. Sure, they dislike it, but since it's my space, they know it's my choice on how to decorate. Since this compromise worked for me, I think it could work for you two since she dislikes it and you like it (and even have a great story for the pieces too that bring you joy from the sounds of it!).

I don't think it's unreasonable to remove something that would make your guest uncomfortable from the room they will be occupying for the duration of their stay.  \n\nAlso, there is no reason to call that woman a nag.  It's sexist and dismissive language.  She is allowed to not enjoy what you enjoy in your home.  I personally don't care either way about taxidermy, but I do think that both partners should get a say about what their home looks like and contains and that they should both be comfortable.

This way he gets to enjoy his carcasses but without bothering others.", ">it\u2019s a disgusting gutless practice to me because the animal goes to waste\n\nHow are you defining trophy hunting? Because if you mean \u201cjust kill it for the antlers and waste everything,\u201d then it\u2019s very doubtful OP meets that definition, because very few people do. Wasting the carcass is illegal in basically any society with any hunting regulations. In my state even leaving too much meat on the bones qualifies as wanton waste, and the minimum punishment is a week in jail and a fine if $2500. They can (and will) seize all equipment you used to go hunting with too. That means your gun, vehicle, boat or plane even if you used one. Hell, you can be charged just for packing the antlers out first, even if you fully intended to go back for the carcass. If a trooper catches you with the head back at your vehicle without the entire carcass as well, you\u2019re having a bad day. \n\nSo if your definition of trophy hunting inherently requires wanton waste, it\u2019s not legal and you\u2019re just describing people committing crimes.
