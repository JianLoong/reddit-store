Instead of having them in 2 seperate areas, how about you both agree on one spot to put them, whether both in the room you frequent or both in the living room?\n\nBut, I am partial. I love taxidermy and oddities. My mother and father are against it, but we agreed that instead of all over, I can keep it all in my room and only in my room. Sure, they dislike it, but since it's my space, they know it's my choice on how to decorate.

I don't think it's unreasonable to remove something that would make your guest uncomfortable from the room they will be occupying for the duration of their stay.  \n\nAlso, there is no reason to call that woman a nag.  It's sexist and dismissive language.  She is allowed to not enjoy what you enjoy in your home.  I personally don't care either way about taxidermy, but I do think that both partners should get a say about what their home looks like and contains and that they should both be comfortable.

This way he gets to enjoy his carcasses but without bothering others.", ">it\u2019s a disgusting gutless practice to me because the animal goes to waste\n\nHow are you defining trophy hunting? Because if you mean \u201cjust kill it for the antlers and waste everything,\u201d then it\u2019s very doubtful OP meets that definition, because very few people do. Wasting the carcass is illegal in basically any society with any hunting regulations. In my state even leaving too much meat on the bones qualifies as wanton waste, and the minimum punishment is a week in jail and a fine if $2500. They can (and will) seize all equipment you used to go hunting with too. That means your gun, vehicle, boat or plane even if you used one. Hell, you can be charged just for packing the antlers out first, even if you fully intended to go back for the carcass. If a trooper catches you with the head back at your vehicle without the entire carcass as well, you\u2019re having a bad day. \n\nSo if your definition of trophy hunting inherently requires wanton waste, it\u2019s not legal and you\u2019re just describing people committing crimes.

YTA", "YTA for this, & more. Why is your pleasure of seeing your taxidermy on the walls, including the living room, more important than your wife\u2019s discomfort/dislike of the items? You are telling your wife every day, that her feelings don\u2019t matter, that you don\u2019t care that she dislikes seeing them. You need to learn compromise & compassion.", "YTA. Dude. It's a couple days, take the deer head down. \n\nSo far in this relationship you've basically said \"f you\" to your wife. She's said outright that she's uncomfortable with animal carcasses hanging from the walls and your compromise was to hang them up anyway. That's pretty selfish. Your wife lives in that house too and you purposely make it uncomfortable for her. She's not asking you to throw it away. Just take it down for a bit while her sister is here. It's not like you'll be using that room while your SIL is in it anyway. \n\nI say all that as someone who's not anti-hunting and thinks deer heads and the ilk are fine if done right.", "So you plan to go into the guest room every day to work out while your sister in law is your guest there? That\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to take down the head for the duration of your sister in law\u2019s trip? Because you plan to go in there every day anyway and you want the first thing you remember as you violate the privacy of your guest to be how you killed that deer?

Just temporarily take it down ffs, it doesn't harm you. You're just being difficult. YTA", "It\u2019s just weird to say you want to be reminded of it every day. Something an ass hole would say when refusing to make a small compromise for the comfort of others for a few days. Which is why YTA.

Not the time to have Rudolph and Blitzen hanging off your wall. Just think how excited you\u2019ll be, to hang them up again.

You'll understand when you grow up.", "I wanna say NTA cuz it's your house she's a guest she's staying with you, but at the same time your wife lives there too why doesn't she have a say and really I don't know why it's such a big deal to take it down for a few weeks I understand it holds memories for you , that memory won't die because he's not up there momentarily you'll have him forever and it's not like you can't put it in an area where you can admire it while she's staying with you ...she's family ... Here's an idea take a picture of it now and use it as your phone lock screen until she leaves", "As someone who lived with a hunter as a child, we had a hallway filled with deer heads... I hated being in that house, my sleep was horrible... and while I can understand it brings out fond memories for you, you need to compromise with you wife since she has a say about home decor aswell, and the comfort for your guest is also important. Isnt there another spot you can move it to?\n\nSo to me a soft YTA, but compromise this isnt the hill to die on.\n\n(Not an english speaker, so typos are there)", "YTA, but not because you have the taxidermy, just because you won't take it down for a short visit. It can go back up the other 360 days in the year, just suck it up for a bit. You won't be physically harmed by having them taken down... pending a taking down accident ahahah", "YTA. It\u2019s really creepy. Your wife\u2019s not asking you to get rid of them, just to temporarily remove them so they don\u2019t creep out guests. Who demands that guests be comfortable with dead animals on the walls, or else they can go elsewhere?", "Yta - also if she is staying in the guest room I would hope you\u2019d be giving her privacy and not going in there during her stay.", "You know you're not going to be using the room while she's in it, right? Like you can't just decide to have a workout on Christmas when your SIL is asleep in the guest room. \n\nTake it down.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nBut I get it. You're reacting like this because of your wife's general opposition to your hobby. This probably feels like a ploy to get rid of the deer heads to you. I would take it down just for the visit and throw it back up there after she leaves. Put it somewhere safe. After the visit, talk with your wife about how much it means to you to have them up and see if you can come to a compromise about the heads since you said she brings it up a lot.", "YTA.  Ok so disregard what it actually is, you are hosting a family member. Your wife and SIL aren\u2019t being demanding, they are asking for something simple. What if you were going to stay at SIL\u2019s house and she had a huge painting of a naked man in the room you were to sleep in? If it made you uncomfortable it would be more than reasonable for her to remove it for your visit.", "Yta firstly it\u2019s only for a few days so why can\u2019t you accommodate them? Secondly why would you be going in there daily if SIL is in there? That\u2019s weird and creepy.", "YTA. \n\nThink of your guests comfort first. You can always put it back once they leave.\n\nListen dude\u2014 I get it. Where I have not (successfully) hunted myself because I didn\u2019t like it when I was a child, my father had two mounted heads (one Elk, one Buck) and when I see them I think of fond memories  of my father. My father passed away. \n\nHowever. \n\nI don\u2019t think my fianc\u00e9 is much of a hunter, and I realized he seemed hesitant when I was talking about bringing one back home with us when I inherited them. (My brother inherited one but he never liked them)\n\nInstead I took his feelings into account and now the heads are hanging in my uncle\u2019s restaurant. I think it\u2019s the best thing as now everyone can enjoy them. \n\nI\u2019d maybe try to compromise with your wife, but that\u2019s not what the thread is about. You can legit put them back when the sister leaves though dude.", "NAH, but I think it would be the better choice to take the head down for a few days for your SIL\u2019s comfort and to keep the peace with your wife.", "YTA Simply because this kind of stuff shouldn't be kept in common spaces such ad the living room. You can keep It in your workout room if you're the only One that uses It but since it's going to be used as a guest room for a bit you should momentarily take It down.", "YTA just comprise for this one short occasion. This way you avoid tension with your SPOUSE", "YTA. You can't take the deer head down for a few days? Honestly...", "YTA this is such a small ask grow up", "YTA. It\u2019s no different than taking down a painting that may make someone uncomfortable for a few short days. It\u2019s called accommodating your guest in the easiest, most simple way.", "YTA. Unless you used a screwdriver to physically bolt the head into the wall (I only see these used for Moose or really large game), it should be relatively easy to tuck a Mount into a storage space for like, a week. You won't be going into that room while SIL is around (I sincerely hope you wouldn't), so just doing a couple simple things to make her more comfortable is just good hosting. You can put it back up when she leaves.\n\nPeople seem very upset by mounted animals here which I do not really get. I'm from the North and it is absolutely normal to have them around here, but I do appreciate some cultures really don't like it. I have a lot of art pieces that have nudity, so I take them down when religious family visits as while they don't say it makes them uncomfortable, I can see that it does.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to be using the workout room every day while your SIL is sleeping in there as a guest.\n\nThe fact your wife also hates the taxidermy means you should be taking the one down from the living room permanently. It\u2019s a shared space.", "YTA if she doesn\u2019t like dead animals as decor then you need to compromise where they are mounted. Also, do you think you\u2019re using the room everyday when her sister visits? That would make me very uncomfortable\n\nAlso, you should show respect for the creatures you kill. Not hang them like a wall plaque", "YTA and this sounds like it's more about you and your wife than your wife's sister.\n\nObviously this is a sticking point for you and you're being stubborn and pretty rude about it. It's not like she's asking you to take it down permanently, why can't you be reasonable?", "YTA. Your wife tolerates it because she loves you. Your SIL doesn\u2019t have any reason to tolerate it.", "Yta", "YTA. Are you going to continue to use that room every day while your wife's sister is staying there? Because that alone makes you the AH in my book.", "INFO, why are you ok with making your wife uncomfortable in her own home?

I actually like taxidermy to a certain degree and even I would find waking up to it exceptionally creepy. Get a grip asshole.", "Here is a similar situation, dumbed down to show the pettiness:\n\n\u2018My wife doesn\u2019t like mushrooms on her pizza. I like mushrooms on my pizza.

It was a struggle when I put my mounted quail up on a shelf because I thought my bird dog was going to get the somehow(he was VERY interested). \nI would still take the one down in the guest room for the time my SIL was there because it\u2019s not difficult and you can just hang it back up when she leaves.", "I didn't catch that.

But it\u2019s all mementoes or what I think of \u201cnature\u2019s art\u201d, not meant as boasting. I think antlers & horns are an absolutely gorgeous feat of evolution and I put them up everywhere. From talking with hunters I know at least some of them are coming from that \u201cnature\u2019s art\u201d perspective; like, thinking antlers are just plain beautiful.

My mom had a painting that had a clown in it that hung in our lower entry way.  It was special to her because of who gave it to her and the story behind it.   In college, one of my friends came to stay and I mentioned to mom that friend didn\u2019t like clowns.

In psychology, there\u2019s a phrase (can\u2019t remember it\u2019s been years since that class), where people are most likely to repeat the last thing they heard (ex. in politics, in a conversation where someone doesn\u2019t know much about the topic they\u2019ll say the last thing they heard on it, whether or not that\u2019s what they actually believe). So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s totally out of the realm of normality for someone to mention it or have that as the default if they\u2019ve never heard much anything different.

I guess her guests were uncomfortable with it so she moved it to the back hallway of the condo building. Same kinda thing, just show some sensitivity to your guests. It was just a little 3 unit condo and she was on the 2nd floor & I was in the 3rd. Only issue was, the laundry\u2019s in the basement, accessed by that back hallway. So every time I or my roomie did laundry, we\u2019d walk down that hallway and confront this gigantic penis, which happened to be placed right around this narrow corner, exactly at eye level, right under a light, so it would kinda leap out at you when you came around the corner lugging your laundry.
