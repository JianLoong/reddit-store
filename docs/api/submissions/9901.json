If other friends saw you two having dinner, it would be logical to note you are celebrating an intimate valentine\u2019s with other another since you are married.", "Do you hate your wife or why do you want a divorce? Because that\u2019s going to happen if you go out with your female friend who has probably feelings for your otherwise she wouldn\u2019t ask you to go to dinner ON VALENTINES DAY behind your wife\u2019s back. Just divorce her instead of doing crap like that.", "Then go a different day, not the one \u201ccouples\u201d holiday that is specifically for taking your romantic partner out on a romantic dinner date.  \nAnd Lmao I scrolled to see if there was more relevant info before I posted, and boy what info it was. So you had an argument, leading to a Valentine\u2019s Day date being cancelled with your WIFE, and you get a harebrained idea that taking another woman and not telling her will somehow be just fine?  \nYou can say \u201coh but we\u2019re just friends, it\u2019s not like that\u201d or whatever all you want, but call up a friend and say \u201cdo you think it would be a problem if I took another woman to dinner on Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d and see if they don\u2019t immediately say \u201clol wtf?\u201d", "Going out to eat in a restaurant, alone, with another woman, on Valentine's Day is by default, \"romantic.\"", "You don't have a reservation that you'll be losing, so why go out tomorrow night?

If you don't think she's likely enough to say yes that you're comfortable asking her, then you'd be an AH to do it.", "What a load of bologna. If it\u2019s no big deal, tell your wife! Or I don\u2019t know maybe make it up to your wife and spend Valentine\u2019s Day with her instead of secretly going on a date with another woman!!\n\nI mean why the hell would this \u201cfriend\u201d offer to spend time with you ***on Valentine\u2019s Day*** unless she had romantic feelings for you. Instead of trying to give you advice of how to smooth things over with the Mrs, she offers to be your substitute Valentine.

I don't believe it's an accident in the least.\n\nAlso - what's up with this \"friend\" who quickly 'volunteers' to go out for this romantic dinner with OP?? She's clearly not married or dating. \n\nIf it were me, I'd be trying to give OP suggestions of how to make it a nice evening at home, for when wife could come home from work.", "Yeah, either he\u2019s looking for the OK to cheat or is just really, really stupid. Neither is a good look.", "I think it\u2019s just telling their character to leave it out.", "Oh, absolutely. A couple of the people who responded forgot completely that tomorrow is Valentine's Day and that's exactly what he intended. He's trying to get authorization to do something he knows is wrong, and deliberately slanting the facts to do it.", "Then this is a very bad idea, she is already mad at you. Don\u2019t make it worse dude.", "OMG then yea if u want a divorce then  go to a Valentine's day dinner with another woman. \n\nDo u even like your wife?  If u do suck it up and spend Valentine's trying to work/argue it out, if not, take the easy way out go to dinner with your gf and get a divorce.\n\nAlso as a side note if I had friend (male or female) who said that to me I wld NOT suggest going to dinner, bc I respect my friends relationships, ur friend does not respect your relationship. \n\nYTA", "Omg that\u2019s even worse to take someone else on her Valentines date after an argument.

That's why he doesn't want to tell his wife", "Totally agree OP needs to be focusing on his relationship with his wife. Hope he reads this and does so.", "He said they had an argument that\u2019s why the wife canceled. So instead of trying to fix things with his wife. He\u2019ll take someone else out on her date. Prob wants to hurt her.", "This! It\u2019s absolutely one of the worst things he could ever do after an argument with the wife is take another woman out on valentines.", "Friend is definitely in this to stir shit. There is no way a woman doesn\u2019t understand the implications of taking a female friend to dinner on Valentine\u2019s after a fight with his wife.\n\nThis woman, OP, is no friend.", "Good question! Or maybe this is fiction.", "Ding ding ding", "Yeah, I noticed that too. The friend is up to no good.", "Yeah, like they did it on purpose.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to avoid. It\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to tell her and make an argument even worse.", "What on earth qualifies to an AH for you then?", "I mean to not do anything special for your significant other on Valentines day but going on plans with someone else.

I just don't see why an opportunity to 1. go out to dinner, 2. with a woman, 3. on that particular day, is needed. Okay, it opens one up... and so? He has lots of other opportunities to go to dinner with his friends on normal occasions. \n\nYou're making sense.
