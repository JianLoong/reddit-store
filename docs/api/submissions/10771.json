Wtf?", "\u201cI know I just sat there and listened to you get sexually harassed by a creepy, grossly perverted stranger for several long minutes just because I wanted to be petty but I\u2019m sorry and heres some candy because that\u2019ll definitely make you trust me again and get rid of any trama\u201d\n\nAre you serious ? OP is TA", "\u201cJust got her to be tortured a bit\u201d touch grass nimrod", "you sound like somebody i would like to avoid as a friend at all costs", "Looking at your profile, you ask kinda lot of questions \"for a friend\" or \"for an exam\". I guess it's pure coincidence that your question \"bc studying for an exam\" is about legally raping women while on a specific medication\nBut that aside, I don't think you see women as equal humans, so does OP, so you both are just massive AHs", "This must be some kind of bait post you can't be serious though man.", "Charlotte did not deserve it but why did she not act on this creep's behavior?", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Right, because it always goes smoothly when a woman rejects a creep hahahaha\n\nEdit: if he was in a position to help a friend, why shouldn't he? because of a stupid argument? petty af, awful friend", "How dare a woman have agency! \n\nYou\u2019re reading my comment all wrong jackass", "an asshole would leave the table completely not looking back. \n\nHe stayed there, made sure this creep did not do anything to her. he just was a petty jerk for getting her tortured, but not that big an asshole", "n asshole would leave the table completely not looking back.\r  \n\r  \nHe stayed there, made sure this creep did not do anything to her. he just was a petty jerk for getting her tortured, but not that big an asshole to me. \n\nA petty jerk is not the same as an asshole in my book.", "I\u2019m going to assume this question was asked in good faith and answer\u2026\n\n1) Fight or flight is actually a misnomer. There\u2019s a third response to terror and danger which is called freeze. It is an involuntary biological response coded into our DNA in that tiny part of our brain left over from ancient days.\n\n2) Often, when women speak up or fight back with someone bold enough to be this creepy, it leads to a more dangerous situation. It\u2019s why many women travel with friends if they go to bars or clubs\u2026 yknow- like Charlotte did\u2026. Because there\u2019s safety in numbers and you know your friends have your back. \n\n3) This is a very victim-blamey question\u2026 She didn\u2019t deserve it BUT (anything follow implies she did). I\u2019m not a racist BUT (usually what follows os racism). If you have to insert a but in the sentence it typically means you are being one in these contexts.", "Because women have been murdered for rejecting creeps like that. Every horrific possibility was probably flying through her head at the same time as she\u2019s being verbally harassed and watching her \u201cfriend\u201d do nothing to help her when she was clearly vulnerable. \u201cJust say no\u201d only works if the creep actually respects \u201cno\u201d", "Possible but a lot of guys who are like this don't recognize a woman's \"no\" and only quit if a guy steps in. Sort of like when a guy is hitting on a woman in a relationship then apologizes *to the guy*, not the girl.", "Did you the post? Where OP said she was \"frozen\" because she was so scared? Sometimes as a woman you literally freeze when men are being incredibly inappropriate! YTA along with OP!", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Right because all men should have to speak for women right?", "He is a huge asshole, she was on the verge of tears and terrified. No argument would ever cause me to just sit there and basically watch my friend get harassed by some creepy pervert who said terrible things just because I wanted to be petty.", "An asshole would leave their friends all alone, not looking back. \n\nAn even bigger, cruel asshole would look their friends in the eyes knowing they want help, do nothing and actually feel good about them getting *tortured* (in your own words), all over a small argument. \n\nIf you think sexual harassment is funny you've got issues and need serious help.", "Yup. As a young single lesbian I told more than one creepy man I was married to get away without getting harmed - including a group of them following a friend & me home one night, harassing us - because they tend to respect even nonexistent men\u2019s ownership over women more than they do women\u2019s right to say no.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "God no, that is not what I said at all \n\nLet's recap: \n\nThey're friends. He could tell that she was uncomfortable and wanted him to step in - he said so himself. He chose not to, because he was being childish.\n\nRegardless of what I think of him as a man, he's a shitty friend. \n\nIf your friend is in a pinch, shouldn't you help them out?", "Yes, good job, that\u2019s exactly what the comment said.\n\nHow about this: if your friend (gender neutral) is being harassed in front of you (gender neutral) and they freeze in fear, you should do something because they\u2019re clearly not okay.", "Hold up. I thought the standard misogynistic counterpoint was Not All Men. So, which is it? \n\nBecause it seems to me that OP recognized *exactly* how inappropriate the creepy dude\u2019s behavior was, and made the conscious decision to allow it. To be petty over a petty argument. Just because he could. \n\nOP weaponized that s**t to punish his friend.", "first of all, the guy was probably drunk, and slurred his speech saying how pretty she was. you and I were not there, I am sure it is being blown out of proportion than what really happened. I highly doubt the guy was like you're pretty let me smell your hair or let me lick you.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Now I don't totally disagree with that however i don't see him as poorly as everyone else here. Was he a dick sure but he didn't abandon her or put her in a dangerous situation. He refused to speak for her at the time out of anger but still stuck around to make sure she was safe. Im going with ESH. Him for waiting so long to speak and her for expecting him to be her white knight without speaking up for herself knowing everyone was already pissed.", "OP says\n> \u201c\u2014when this really creepy guy walked up between us and started saying some awful, perverse things to her\u201d\n> \u201che said the creepiest stuff so I couldn\u2019t help but look at her\u201d\n\nSo I HIGHLY doubt it was just \u201cyou\u2019re really pretty\u201d comments that were being made.

Sounds to me like you haven\u2019t ever been a young woman in a bar.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Look, I think it's important for everyone to be able to speak up for themselves. I certainly have. However, not everyone is capable of doing so (regardless of gender, perhaps they're shy, socially anxious or people pleasers).\n\nAlso, there are certain people that just creeps us out and we're afraid to take action (again, regardless of gender). \n\nSo, no, I don't think it was wrong of her to expect her friend to help her out. I have a guy friend that is 2m/6'5 tall and is often uncomfortable in social situations, so I help him out. I've also had a female friend help me out. \n\nAnd as I've said before, speaking out against some people can just cause a bigger issue. There are lots of men that simply won't accept no, it's a fact. Do you know what they usually do accept? \"I have a boyfriend\", because they won't respect the woman, but will the man. So it is an unfortunate fact that women can be more vulnerable against men in these settings.  (I'm now speaking about my personal exp as a straight woman, so if straight men have had this problem with women and want to speak out, that's perfectly fine)", "[removed]", "I respect your views even if I don't necessarily agree with everything.
