I also noticed that my sisters lunch had already been made and her breakfast things had been washed up.\n\nMy mum asked if i wanted her to make my lunch, but i said no thanks and id make myself a sandwich. A minute later, i go to the kitchen to get my phone and to make my sandwich and i see my mum microwaving some soup for me.\n\nI told her that i wouldnt be able to eat that as I\u2019d lost the container for it, and it would melt any of our other containers. She then proceeds to yell at ME because \u201cwhy would you ask me to make this for you then?!\u201d\n\nI didnt ask her to make it. We argued for a while before she left for work and to take my sister to school.

You may get a little heavier, you may get stretch marks etc. That's normal, fine, and healthy.\n\nYour mom doesn't need to comment on your body. Especially if it makes you feel bad.", "NTA\n\nShe took away your prep time by making you walk with her, tried to make it up to you by making you lunch, got mad because you didn't have a container to bring it in, and tried to make this your fault. At that moment, she probably processed this as you rejecting her attempts to rope you into her healthier lifestyle.\n\nThis is not a discussion to have early in the morning when everyone is rushing to get somewhere, but I hope you're able to resolve this later in the day.", "What exactly are you the asshole about? For not taking any form of lunch to school. Struggling to understand the issue here. Apart from the issues you and your mum are having.", "So she set you up to not be able to have a lunch? Did you not get to eat lunch that day? No, you don't need to be going on walks when you are supposed to be finishing getting ready for school. Your mom needs to not start drama in the morning. Next time, just ignore her. If this becomes a pattern, start making your lunch the night before. Do you have another parent? \n\nDon't get involved in this with her. NTA.", "NTA. What's going on with your mother that she imagined you asked her to prepare soup for you? She needs to see a doctor. You did nothing wrong. You sound more responsible than your mother. Isn't she aware of what time you have to get on the bus? It almost sounds like she is an alcoholic, mentally ill, or may have an issue with her brain. In any event, your mother, needs to see a doctor to find out what's going on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
