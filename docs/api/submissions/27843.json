She also sometimes blames my family for asking me to come home and help with various tasks and responsibilities.\nTo accommodate her wishes, I've already prioritized her over other friend groups, but it's becoming quite exhausting for me. For instance, just yesterday, we went out for breakfast and spent around 4 hours together at a local fair.

She suggested alternatives like my brother taking a cab or calling another sibling for help, and she still asked if I was bored of her when I told her that it is not possible.\n\nAdditionally, whenever I visit her, I stay for slightly over two hours.

Just be honest and say that you have more obligations than she does and it takes up a lot of her schedule, that you physically CANNOT prioritize her any more than you're already doing. Even though sometimes people see the things around then, they may not actually *realize* it until its pointed out to them.\n\nMaybe suggest her trying to find a nearby club she can participate it, or doing classes or something. (My small city has clubs of all sort, theres a pigeon club, a minature-making club, and god knows how many cooking and sewing classes there are.) Id be careful to word this in a way that isn't \"go out and meet people\" and try to frame it as \"Heres some things to do when I'm not around,\" because then in *her* mind its 1) keeping busy until she can hang out with you next 2) she meets people as a result of going to these places.\n\nIf she reacts poorly to saying you have other obligations, though, it may be best to rethink the friendship.", "NTA\n\nThere is something here; the way she tried to guilt you, to be territorial, to take all your time.\n\nThat is controlling.\n\nYou seemed to be a good friend, why are you so afraid that she would misunderstand?\n\nYou dont have to justify yourself or feel guilty.\n\nStay strong.", "YTA if you prescribe a cure (e.g., \"go make more friends\"). NTA if you just state your boundaries with a focus on your limits without telling your friend to basically go get a life.\n\nIMHO if you really care and are that close you should be able to directly figure out the root of the issue here. Does she have some kind of unhealthy emotional attachment to you, etc.", "Blaming family is not ok. Doesn't sound like a healthy friendship at all. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou need to sit her down and tell her the whole truth. Your life doesn't (and should never) revolve around her. You have work, family and other friend commitments the equal or exceed your commitment to her. You have tried to prioritize her requirements to your own detriment. Let her know you cannot go on like this, and she needs to broaden her social life and not rely totally on you for her social life", "NTA! I don't think there is any amount of time that you can spend with a person like this that would make her happy. She is being so wildly clingy and unreasonable that I would really consider whether in fact you should take a proper break from hanging out with her. \n\nAt the very least, start picking up your other friendships and make arrangements to spend time with your friends and family. Be less available to her. If she asks why, say, bluntly that you felt she was being unreasonably possessive of your time and it's annoying you and making you need a break from her.", "NTA. She sounds exhausting and very needy. Just set your boundaries and stick to them. Don\u2019t let her guilt trip you.", "Jfc you sound robotic. Goddamn", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just tell her you have a full time job and you try your best to see her as much as you can. Tell her you value your friendship but she shouldn\u2019t push so much. You need time for yourself too.", "YWBTA if you phrase it that way. \n\nIt would be more appropriate to be clear about what YOU are prepared to do in terms of time commitment and leave it at that. She can sort out her own way to respond and to live her life.", "Nope. You're NTA. \n\nI'm an introvert and this is exhausting just to read. I would have faked my own death and left the country if I were you but ya know....", "NTA. Don't word it that way but definitely sit her down and set some boundaries. She will fix her issues when she wants to and when she is ready; you can't do that for her. You need to tell her what you've outlined here, that you have other priorities and obligations and she can't be the center of your world. Then enforce those boundaries. You can't make yourself responsible for her health.", "You wouldn\u2019t be the asshole, but if you are pushing her to make new friends/attachments, I would recommend helping her. I understand your friend\u2019s POV, I bet she just needs a push in the right direction.", "She goes to stuff like these every while but nothing holds her interest long enough, she tried cooking classes she went once got bored and stopped, she went to soap making work shops, cookies and baking ... etc but never continued, she is constant with art classes though.\n\nBut what I am worried about is the fact that she didn't make any relationships with anyone from these activities, so I'm worried that in her opinion I'm enough and the only friend that she needs.", "Actually there is a situation that happened a while back which is the reason why I worry about her misunderstanding, justify my self and feel guilty.\n\nA while back she called me and sent me texts multiple times, it was during work hours so it took a while for me to answer, and when I opened the texts later I found out that she had a melt down and assumed that I was purposefully ignoring her and that I don't like her anymore and such, and because I know that I'm the only friend she has in the country (she left since she was a child and came back after finishing University) I worry about our relationship a lot.", "She left the country when she was a child and came back after college, she couldn't get a job so I'm basically the only friend she has had for the past couple of years.", "Yes, this. Had a hard lesson myself on this recently.", "The blaming family thing seriously angered me, might even say it was the reason behind me thinking more about our relationship.", "Your friend needs therapy. The way she is emotionaly dependant is not safe for her and is taking a toll on you.\n\nShe managed to guilt-trap you with this meltdown.\n\nI know you are a good friend and a caring person. Just ask yourself how will she react the day you get married?", "Why is she so clingy? Why doesn't she have other friends? Does she not speak the language in your country?", "It sounds really sad but you can't save them all. You need to have The Conversation where the message needs to be very clear that \"if you ask for more, then you will get less. If after that you keep asking for even more, then you will get nothing\".\n\nSet clear boundaries. This kind of attachment is incredibly unhealthy for both parties if allowed to progress unchecked. Most likely she will not be able to control herself and to preserve your own mental health you will have to cut her out of your life completely. Sad but true.", "To tell the truth I did think about that, I'm almost carefree now and if I get married I will have a household  and a husband that I will have responsibilities towards.\nAnd I have no idea how can I bring up therapy without sounding offensive especially that she once shared a story where she seems to have been physically bullied in a past job and I have no idea what else she might have gone through.", "I have no idea for the first two but maybe it is a comfort zone thing? And for the language barrier no she is fluent in the spoken language in the country and I actually know multiple foreigners who had no issues making friends in the country because English is will spoken in the erea.", "I know you care about her but you indulge in her behaviour in a way.\n\n>\"therapy without sounding offensive especially that she once shared a story where she seems to have been physically bullied in a past job and I have no idea what else she might have gone through\"\n\nDo you realize you are already blocking yourself this solution?", "I didn't notice... I should find a way to talk to her about it then"]}
