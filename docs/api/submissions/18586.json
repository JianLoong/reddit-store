Day-long hikes, wineries, kayaking trips down large rivers; you get the idea. Plus my SIL doesn't seem that interested in kids. She never helps or offers to help keep an eye on the kids during family gatherings. She isn't rude when I turn down the invites. She just says she understands and hopes I can join them next time.\n\nWe had a Barbeque a couple weeks ago at my parents house.

She nodded and said she understood. \n\nIt was then I mentioned it would be great if she and her friends did stuff the kids could do once in a while.

You are a mom, they aren\u2019t and while it\u2019s sucks, no one wants to hang around kids when they don\u2019t have them. Heck, I\u2019m a mom and I don\u2019t want to hang around other people\u2019s kids. You\u2019d be better off looking for friends with kids and make peace with the fact that your SIL and her friends won\u2019t want to do kid-centric stuff until they have kids, if they ever do.", "YTA, are you serious?  \"She never helps or offers to help keep an eye on the kids during family gatherings.\"  Why would she?  They're YOUR kids.  I don't have kids or want them, and it blows my mind to think that if I were at a family gathering anyone would be under the assumption that it would even cross my mind to take care or/watch their kids.  Why don't you offer to invite HER to do something with you?  Get a babysitter and just grab dinner, or bring the fam to the beach or something.", "I'm kinda siding with your brother on this. She's trying to include you, but she can't change the whole dynamic for you given your the only one with kids. It sucks but there's nothing stopping you arranging 1:1 get together with her and the kids rather than her friends", "I think you are being a little short sighted in this one.  It is a little egocentric to expect a group of people to do things that only appeal to you, and it's unrealistic to expect her to coerce her childless friends to do the child friendly activities you want when it clearly isn't their thing. She is offering to include you with ***her*** friends.  Many parents occasionally spend time away from their children as a little adult time.  Don't be surprised if she no longer does.\n\n I also think you are being a little entitled expecting your family to baby sit.  You had children, not them.  You can't expect them to babysit just because you want it nor get mad when they don't offer.  YTA.", "Gently, YTA. This is an existing friend group and it's really not on them to plan kid-friendly activities when none have kids of their own. Perhaps your brother can take them so you can go on one of the outings? Honestly though, finding a mom group sounds like your best plan of action. I think your SIL is being very nice for inviting you if there is a chance you can come.", "They are inviting *you* to these adult outings. Not you and your children. \n\nIf you can\u2019t or  won\u2019t get a babysitter and go with the grownups , well, *fine*, but don\u2019t expect these childless people to accommodate your children. YTA", "Very soft YTA\n\nIt sounds like SIL is really trying to bring you into her friend group. But she wants to hang out with you, not your kids. Implying that her child-free friend group should accommodate your kids is a slightly unaware thing to ask. You should hire a babysitter or have your husband watch the kids, or continue to politely decline her invitations.", "I don\u2019t want to make you feel bad, because it sounds like you\u2019ve had a hard time lately, but from what I read, I think you are misunderstanding the nature of your relationship with your SIL.  She\u2019s a nice lady but she isn\u2019t super interested in your children. She is nice enough to allow you to tag along with her when she is hanging out with her friends, probably in part because you only say yes rarely. But her friends aren\u2019t dying to see you and have you there - it\u2019s probably more that they are nice people like your SIL and don\u2019t mind doing her a favor by including you since you are probably a nice person too and not difficult to hang out with. But no one wants you there so badly that they\u2019ll plan something just to have you there, especially if it means introducing multiple children into a social group that\u2019s just for adults to relax and have fun. You aren\u2019t an asshole really, but YTA is how to mark that you are in the wrong so there you go.\n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d do a light apology to your SIL, not over the top, just a \u201chey, I realized that I made things awkward when I asked about including the kids. I wasn\u2019t really thinking and of course it wouldn\u2019t make sense to do that. I hope you aren\u2019t annoyed and I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you including me up until now.\u201d Then think of these invites as a temporary stop gap until you can find friends more at your stage of life (kids)", "Yta to expect your SIL and her childless friend group  to cater to your children by doing \"child friendly\" activities for your convenience  they are being gracious extending you an invite and understanding that you cant always go If you want childfriendly activities look up local playgroups in your area and make mommy friends (if you find a good match you can also trade of babysitting duties so you can get out childfree more often). You're also the AH for even commenting that SIL doesn't watch your kids during family activities. It's not her responsibility.", "YTA. If you want kid friendly activities, you can plan something. SIL and her friends may not like that anyways but that will be a fair way for you to approach them rather than expecting people with no childcare experience to plan child friendly event.", "YTA - it's not your SILs responsibility to entertain or babysit you kids. She wants to spend time with her grownup friends, not make a playdate.", "YTA reluctantly because I\u2019ve seen this happen and it can be isolating to not have friends because being a mom changes everything but you can\u2019t ask a group of child free girls to include more kid friendly things because they are inviting you and not your kids, she doesn\u2019t have to help you with your kids or make accommodations with her friends for your kids.", "YTA. That\u2019s some audacity to ask a whole group of people you\u2019ve never met/barely know to change their dynamic because you have kids. Ask your family to babysit or hire a babysitter. \n\nFYI, she isn\u2019t inviting your kids; just you. That\u2019s why they aren\u2019t \u201cchild friendly\u201d activities. She\u2019s trying to give YOU a chance to get out and do things.", "YTA, she was trying to be nice, she keeps asking so if you get a sitter or something you can go,if none of them have kids it makes sense they do kid free activities", "YTA - nope,  most 20 something women have zero interest in doing child friendly things. If that\u2019s what you want then you organize something and you invite them. But don\u2019t expect people to organize their lives around YOU and YOUR choices", "Soft YTA\n\nLook. At the end of the day -- she is really sweet and kind for inviting you even though you generally have to decline. \n\nBut it's unreasonable to expect her, without kids, and her friends, also without, to cater to you when you aren't even really part of the group. \n\nThe only real reasonable/ easy solution here is if your actual BROTHER would offer to look after his niblings on such occasions.", "YTA. SIL doesn\u2019t have kids neither do her friends so why would they plan things that involve kids? Not everyone loves children.", "Soft YTA. As I get the loneliness factor in reverse. I\u2019m at an age where having chosen to be childless, my friends now have them. So I don\u2019t really see them unless I want to be surrounded by kids. Nope. Not my thing. \n\nHaving kids for most is a choice, and unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t something you asked for, but it has happened that you\u2019re a single parent. \n\nBut, similarly, those without children are entitled to enjoy their spare time as they will. Hence. Activities are not child friendly. \n\nYour SIL is still inviting you, so although it\u2019s difficult, she is trying. \n\nIt may change over time as people get older, settle down, however, perhaps if you can, ask any supporting family (brother, parents, maybe?) if they\u2019d be happy to take the kids once in a while. If it\u2019s genuinely once in a while, perhaps sleepover at grandparents would be fun? And you can go out with SIL?", "YTA but gentle. You should seek out mlms/parents parents of other kids to do stuff. Your SIL doesn't have kids and it's not reasonable to expect her to change her outings. Getting a sitter when you are able and joining her can help you keep your relationship with her.", "Gentle YTA - you and your SIL are at different places in your lives. I think it would be great if you could make some additional friends of your own who have kids, either through a parent Facebook group or with parents at your kids daycare or school, who will be more into doing kids activities and I am sure also appreciate having some adult interactions while the kids play. Best of luck to you.", "YTA.\n\nShe and her friends don't plan child-friendly trips because they have no children and enjoy things that aren't conducive to hauling children along for. You're an AH for suggesting that they should plan trips to amuse your children because that's not what they like and they have no obligation--and obviously no interest in--to plan around your children. Your SIL is being kind by always inviting you despite your lack of participation, because she understand your situation. It's incredibly selfish of you to expect them to change just to include your children.", "YTA they don't have kids. Why would they want to do \"kid friendly\" events? \n\nBeing a single mom is hard. However, the hard truth is that's not their problem. SIL is trying to include you, but you need to meet her halfway.", "NAH\n\n>Plus my SIL doesn't seem that interested in kids. She never helps or offers to help keep an eye on the kids during family gatherings.\n\nNONE of that is her responsibility. \n\nYou can ask her to have more kid-friendly activities, but she is entirely free to decline. And that seems to be what she did. I'd recommend that YOU plan some outings and invite friends rather than putting that planning on someone else.", "YTA. You can\u2019t expect a bunch of childless people to give up their non-child friendly plans that they enjoy so you can bring your children along.", "NAH. Not having kids is a very different walk of life, but that is very nice of her to invite you to things she is interested in. It can be very hard for someone without kids to come up with ideas that are child friendly. But, you're definitely not the AH either though because having to figure things out with the kids can be very tough. That's a good thing to suggest doing something more child friendly, and perhaps you can find something (like a lake day or smaller hikes that the kids can also enjoy) that she can bring her friends too as well!", "YTA. You, not your kids were invited. If you can\u2019t get a babysitter that\u2019s your issue. Don\u2019t expect a whole group to change their activities for you.", "YTA why are you trying to make her your event planner? She\u2019s inviting you to shit she\u2019s already doing. Stop trying to make it about you and forcing your kids on everyone. \n\nYou are a whole person, not just a mother.", "I would say that neither of you are really the Ahole here. Your sister in law isn't required to make her and her friends activities child friendly if none of them also have children. Also, have you tried maybe putting together activities or even suggesting specific ones.", "Is it just me that thinks if she was actually trying to be friends she'd at least just hang out for coffee or a picnic on occasion? It's not all the time and it was a suggestion after you've had to decline multiple times.\nIf she doesn't want to be around kids that's fair enough just be honest about it\nNta", "NAH here. You tried broaching the subject of more kid friendly activities, and she declined. As long as you leave it there and don\u2019t press the issue, it seems fine. \n\nGiven the age difference with her and your brother it woudl not surprise me if kids or not was maybe a sore subject with them but that\u2019s a complete guess as to why he made it a bigger deal than it had to be.", "NAH.\n\nI think it\u2019s okay to ask, but not okay to expect. And it\u2019s definitely not okay to expect outings other people organize to be organized around your kids!\n\nHow often have you invited her to do something that does work for you? You can\u2019t take that many littles on a long hike, but there are short walks with snacks that work pretty well. Or a half day at a small beach. \n\nBoating would depend entirely on your comfort level - I know families that have the infant life jackets and think nothing more of taking a tiny baby on a boat than taking them to a park, and I know families where that is absolutely unthinkable.\n\nWhale watching, if it\u2019s available near you might work well.\n\nGet yourself out, consider anything you do out of the house a success, and remind yourself that they will not be so small and so hard to take out for too much longer. My 8 year old is at the point where she has neighborhood friends and has to be called in for dinner and I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m finally getting out of the little kid arena where everything I did had to be appropriate for a small child.", "Nah\n\nYou asked and got your answer. You'd be an ah if you pushed it further.\n\nMaybe you could hire a baby sitter or plan stuff yourself with her?", "YTA\n\n>Plus my SIL doesn't seem that interested in kids. She never helps or offers to help keep an eye on the kids during family gatherings.\n\nYou seem pretty judgmental about that. As if you are entitled to free childcare from your SIL.\n\nNewsflash: Not everyone is interested in kids. You are not entitled to free childcare.\n\nAnd you seem to judge your Sil very harshly for this, since she is a woman. You don't seem to judge your brother for not providing free childcare. This is very sexist. Sadly, you seem to believe in patriarchal 'woman = mother' bullshit.\n\nNewsflash: 'woman' and 'mother' are NOT synonyms. Not all women are maternal. Not all women love kids. Not all women have to worship your kids and provide free childcare.\n\nNot her children, not her responsibility.", "NAH - just a little misunderstanding. Why not tell her- I love that you invite me. I so want to come everything but I can only make a few. Please don't stop inviting me as I know I can rarely go. But kids and all ya know.   \n\nJust have her be your adult friends away from kids friends.  Yeah you can rarely go- but so what. What if they have kids some time?", "YTA. If you want child friendly activities,  YOU should plan them and invite others.", "NTA for asking, just don't push the issue. You should find some mom friends though.", "YTA. First, she doesn't have to offer to keep an eye on your kids during family gatherings. \n\nSecond, it's not realistic to expect a group of mid 20 somethings to want to participate in child friendly activities. Especially when they don't have kids themselves.", "YTA for suggesting that a group of child free 20-somethings plan child-friendly events to accommodate you.

That was temporary and now our kids are older and they have young kids we can do more things together.", "You want a bunch of other people's friends, who don't have kids, to do kid-friendly activities so you can have a social life without effort.

It doesn't sound like you nagged or whined about it.  And I can't really blame your SIL and her friends for not wanting three kids to tag along.  If your kids did tag along, chances are, you'd need a couple of them to help you since you can really only hold one kid at a time.\n\nCan your brother or another family member watch your kids for a day so that you could join them once in a while?", "YTA.

One day, when they have children, they will understand. Their priorities will change rapidly and all of a sudden the wineries become the trampoline park and Little League games.\n\nI would encourage you to find a new friends group of people in your stage of life.

I feel like this is the perfect examples of no good deed goes unpunished. SIL was trying to be nice by inviting OP on outings with her friends. OP should have just said no insteaad of suggesting that SIL and her friend plan child friendly activities. OP isn't friends with these people. So there is no incentive for them to want to alter their plans just so OP can hangout with them. SIL was just trying to be nice I doubt she cares if OP comes.

I don't plan on pressing the issue anymore, but thank you for your comments.", "I agree, OP is NTA for saying it'd be nice if once in a while an activity were more kid friendly so she could go. People are acting like she demanded SIL change her whole lifestyle - she didn't. She made a comment, it was rejected, that was that. People are also ignoring the fact that while it *is* nice that SIL is trying to include OP, she needs to understand that the things she's inviting her to aren't feasible. It would be a very kind gesture to occasionally plan an activity that OP could attend. Kid friendly doesn't mean kid-centric. SIL doesn't have to do this, obviously, but it would be a nice thing to do.", "Hiring a baby sitter for three kids is a little out of my budget.

Most likely she will stop inviting you to anything (it was extremely nice of her to try to include you in the first place).

People who don't have kids don't for a myriad of reasons - they don't want to be responsible for them, wailing drives them crazy, they just don't know how to interact with them, kids can be destructive, etc. So to say people without kids are being selfish by not actively planning their group activities around them is wild. It is entitled to say that people need to want to be around your kids. Not everyone does, and that's okay.

Just for example, last month I was trying to make plans with my cousin, who's got young kids, and I thought I was being super accommodating by saying I'd drive to her town and treat them all to lunch at whatever restaurant she picked, so she didn't have to cook, but she told me that actually, with the ages, restaurants are kind of too much stress right now. Fortunately, she's actually willing to put in the effort too, so we came up with a plan that worked for both of us (we coordinated who packed what for a picnic and we went to a park near her house).\n\nBut this was just me trying to make a plan for a meal together, and I still didn't really understand what was going to be feasible for her, because that's not my life experience.

My friends are not the type to go drinking at clubs so us all hanging out talking about comics and such is what we were doing before we had kids.

I've met up with my friends who have kids at breweries before - my friends make sure their kids have coloring to do or whatever while we all have a beer together. It's accessible for them with their children while not being kid centric. This is not difficult to do.\n\nEdit: besides, doing an *occasional* activity that OP could actually attend doesn't change the dynamic. This group hangs out doing their thing all the time.

It's a really hard and at times a lonely place to be. I have mom friends now and I feel so much more fulfilled hanging out with people who just get it and who I can actually hang out with More because the kids can play together.

I'm sure your 5yo goes to school.

None of them have kids, they're not going to want to change what they do just because YOU have kids. If you want people to hang out with that will do kid friendly things then make friends with people with kids. Join a mom group (although from what I hear those can be toxic as heck), get to know the other parents in your kids class or daycare. Make play dates with other parents at school/daycare. START a mom group for your area. Go out with sil and her friends when you're able, but don't expect them to want to include kids when none of them have kids to bring along too.", "YTA. OP said she mentioned this to her SIL at a family BBQ that her parents were also at.  Why couldn't she ask them to babysit occasionally so she could hangout with SIL and her friends?  Like others have said, it's a dick move to expect a group of adults to carer to a bunch of kids they don't know and participate in child-friendly activities when that clearly isn't the vibe in the group.", "NAH. It is fine to ask as long as you accept no as an answer. It is also fine for the SIL to decline.", "YTA big time. Get a babysitter. And don\u2019t expect her to watch your kids at events. Ever.

Be grateful she tries to include you for that 1% of the time you can go along. \n\nIf it were just you and her it arranging things together it might be different but don't be expecting people without kids to do kid friendly activities. Or watch your kids, people without kids don't have to watch your kids and frankly we don't want to.\n\nYou've had a rough turn with little support and an absent father of the children, that sucks massively. Please don't ask for more out of people trying to offer you some fun social activities.", "Very gentle YTA, you've been invited to join someone else's friends group, and to join in their activities and none of them have kids? THEY DIDN'T INVITE YOUR KIDS.\n\nIf you want a kid-friendly activity it's on you to plan it and invite others.\n\nIt would have been perfectly reasonable to let her know that childcare issues make it hard for you to join in but it sounds like she's well aware of that and continues to invite you out of kindness for the occasions when you can make it.\n\nYou have your own friends, maybe focus on them for a while. And think about hosting the occasional casual gathering at your home or somewhere with an option for the kids to play that you can invite your SIL to instead of expecting all the social connection to go one way.\n\nKeeping social connections when you have super young kids is VERY HARD, especially with people who don't. You clearly need some more mum friends in your life. This will happen as your kids head towards school, etc.", "NTA, you didn't ask or tell her to plan things around your kids, you just said it would be nice if you did kid-friendly activities once in a while, you made a polite comment/suggestion and when SIL said they did things they like and that's what they'll do, you respected that.", "Sorry, but YTA.  Your SIL and friends are all child-free, they can't be expected to alter their activities just for you.  Maybe easier said than done, but maybe you should look for some mother-child groups you could join, that way you can be sure the activities are child friendly.", "When our kids were little I was in several mom's groups that had activities like play dates, trips to the zoo and children's museums. We would also swap babysitting.

She may be totally in the dark on this, but with the comments of being close to her husband already, that really makes it seem like she'd be fully aware she's inviting you to a pattern of things that you simply can't go to and that seems cruel.\n\nIf this was someone with more distance, then I think that'd be a different sort of thing, but presumably a sister in law that's married to a close brother is aware of this enough to know that she's offering you things you can't accept. It feels like watching someone win a fancy prize knowing that they'll have to later turn it down because they can't afford the taxes on it.", "If all you did was mention it in passing, you\u2019re NTA.

Hang out at Chuckie Cheese?", "Perhaps if you want kid friendly plans you arrange them and invite SIL along. Sounds like she's putting all the effort in to arranging these activities and then including you. Perhaps if you want child friendly activities you put the effort into organising them.\n\nSoft YTA - they don't have kids, they have invited you to adult only activities. Trying to change this is a sure fire way of getting yourself uninvited", "Maybe SIL asks OP along on outings knowing full well that OP would have to decline. SIL might just be being polite and keeping the peace because OP's brother keeps insisting that SIL invites OP?", "No one is the asshole here. The SIL is allowed to be offended the OP asked, the OP is allowed to ask. Some people just don't like kids or feel awkward around them and that's ok. Honestly, any gathering with 3 children will end in the gathering being about the kids. \n\nMy only suggestion is to invite 1 or 2 quite people over for some wine after the kids are in bed, which I assume is like 8 pm or so.", "NTA OP.\n\nYou asked, she said no, and explained why.\n\nIf you keep asking though, ... THEN Y-W-B-T-A.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologise to your SIL for making her feel uncomfortable (apologies are free).\n\nThen find a local babysitter, and go on the next excursion!", "NAH. Seriously people here hate kids. You can be childless and still enjoy the occasional activity with them.\n\nYou're allowed to ask, she's allowed to refuse. I don't see why anyone should be upset about asking the question. All these people getting their knickers in a twist for daring to ask childless adults if they would do something that involves children.\n\nKids can be fun, wholesome child friendly activities can be fun. I don't have children myself but I wouldn't mind hanging out with them occasionally if we were going camping or something. I still want to enjoy adult activities and I understand the parents have priorities so sometimes that means they miss out. If they wanted to hang out but need to bring the kids along, I may accommodate them, I may not. No harm in asking, no one needs to get upset about it.\n\nThat said your SIL is under no obligation to babysit for you. She has no obligation to change her plans to accommodate you. But no harm in asking. NAH", "I'm not going to call the OP an AH, but she was out of line and wrong for how she handled things.  I'm sure she is stressed out being a single mother. From this story, the only AH is the OP's Ex. I hope he is paying his share in Child support!", "I don't think you're an asshole for asking. I do agree with your brother that she's inviting you into her group and isn't looking to spend time with your kids. \n\nYou asked. She gave an answer. You seemingly accepted the answer. \n\nNAH.", "The OP needs to find friends at a play group who will want to do child centred activities.", "Not only that. But she also complains that the sil doesn't volunteer to babysit OP's kids. Like bro this is not mandatory. And the cherry on top is that OP is upset that the rest of the family doesn't step up more so she can go out. Like they do babysit already I assume when OP works but now she wants time so that she can go out with her friends without her kids. Meanwhile, she's upset because she wants her kids included whenever sil goes out with friends. She probably expects to be covered too with expenses. YTA\n\nYou just burned a bridge.", "It\u2019s not that nice of a gesture if the invitations don\u2019t take into account OP\u2019s life situation. They don\u2019t seem sincere. I don\u2019t think the SIL is an asshole for not wanting to plan kid-friendly activities, but she doesn\u2019t really get brownie points for repeatedly inviting the OP to activities she\u2019s obviously going to say no to because she has no way to reasonably accommodate them. If I\u2019m a regular person and my rich friend repeatedly invites me to come on her lavish international trips, no expenses paid, that doesn\u2019t make her nice. If I\u2019m sober and my friends only ever invite me out to bars that\u2019s not a praiseworthy gesture.

The idea that she's entitled and demanding or a freeloader seems without merit.", "I would not electively take children with me on what is my free time.

She made a backhanded statement about how it sure would be nice if the SIL and her friends altered their entire plans to include OP and her kids.\n\nAsking genuinely is one thing (and still kind of the asshole, because you... can... suggest things... yourself). She didn't do that.\n\n\"Would you folks be interested in joining me and the kids at the painting place on Saturday?\" //not at all the asshole, very good\n\n\"Would you mind planning an activity that caters to my kids?\" //kind of an asshole, she's not your event planner unless you're paying her or best friends\n\n\"It sure would be NICE if you and your friends occasionally did something that included my kids\" //asshole", "You\u2019re downvoted but I bet there is some truth to this a little bit.

It didn\u2019t seem like you were implying it was bad that she didn\u2019t ever watch them or she should want to. I like kids but I don\u2019t have any so I look forward to spending some time with/watching the ones I see at family gatherings. Same is true for my boyfriend. I think it\u2019s actually pretty reasonable to guess that if someone doesn\u2019t like kids enough to voluntarily watch over them they might not be stoked about bringing them on days out.", "Can't your brother babysit when his wife is away with you and her friends? Or... organize a day out with the kids and invite your SIL to accompany you! Don't wait for others to take action, but take the initiative yourself. Then you can make the day as childfriendly as you wish and spend some time with your SIL. There are many things that are fun that don't cost much, like a picknick or a day in a swimming pool / sea / lake.", "I wouldn't be ok if  I agreed to an adult outing to suddenly have kids there.

She said \u201cit\u2019d be great if she and her friends did stuff the kids could do once in a while\u201d and that definitely reads to me as asking them to organise an outing that her kids could go to.
