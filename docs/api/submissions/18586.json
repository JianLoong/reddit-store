Day-long hikes, wineries, kayaking trips down large rivers; you get the idea. Plus my SIL doesn't seem that interested in kids. She never helps or offers to help keep an eye on the kids during family gatherings. She isn't rude when I turn down the invites. She just says she understands and hopes I can join them next time.\n\nWe had a Barbeque a couple weeks ago at my parents house.

She nodded and said she understood. \n\nIt was then I mentioned it would be great if she and her friends did stuff the kids could do once in a while. My SIL got a little awkward and said that none of her friends had kids and this is just what they liked to do.

You are a mom, they aren\u2019t and while it\u2019s sucks, no one wants to hang around kids when they don\u2019t have them. Heck, I\u2019m a mom and I don\u2019t want to hang around other people\u2019s kids. You\u2019d be better off looking for friends with kids and make peace with the fact that your SIL and her friends won\u2019t want to do kid-centric stuff until they have kids, if they ever do.", "YTA, are you serious?  \"She never helps or offers to help keep an eye on the kids during family gatherings.\"  Why would she?  They're YOUR kids.  I don't have kids or want them, and it blows my mind to think that if I were at a family gathering anyone would be under the assumption that it would even cross my mind to take care or/watch their kids.  Why don't you offer to invite HER to do something with you?  Get a babysitter and just grab dinner, or bring the fam to the beach or something.", "I'm kinda siding with your brother on this. She's trying to include you, but she can't change the whole dynamic for you given your the only one with kids. It sucks but there's nothing stopping you arranging 1:1 get together with her and the kids rather than her friends", "I think you are being a little short sighted in this one.  It is a little egocentric to expect a group of people to do things that only appeal to you, and it's unrealistic to expect her to coerce her childless friends to do the child friendly activities you want when it clearly isn't their thing. She is offering to include you with ***her*** friends.  Many parents occasionally spend time away from their children as a little adult time.  Don't be surprised if she no longer does.\n\n I also think you are being a little entitled expecting your family to baby sit.  You had children, not them.  You can't expect them to babysit just because you want it nor get mad when they don't offer.  YTA.", "Gently, YTA. This is an existing friend group and it's really not on them to plan kid-friendly activities when none have kids of their own. Perhaps your brother can take them so you can go on one of the outings? Honestly though, finding a mom group sounds like your best plan of action. I think your SIL is being very nice for inviting you if there is a chance you can come.", "They are inviting *you* to these adult outings. Not you and your children. \n\nIf you can\u2019t or  won\u2019t get a babysitter and go with the grownups , well, *fine*, but don\u2019t expect these childless people to accommodate your children. YTA", "Very soft YTA\n\nIt sounds like SIL is really trying to bring you into her friend group. But she wants to hang out with you, not your kids. Implying that her child-free friend group should accommodate your kids is a slightly unaware thing to ask. You should hire a babysitter or have your husband watch the kids, or continue to politely decline her invitations.", "I don\u2019t want to make you feel bad, because it sounds like you\u2019ve had a hard time lately, but from what I read, I think you are misunderstanding the nature of your relationship with your SIL.  She\u2019s a nice lady but she isn\u2019t super interested in your children. She is nice enough to allow you to tag along with her when she is hanging out with her friends, probably in part because you only say yes rarely. But her friends aren\u2019t dying to see you and have you there - it\u2019s probably more that they are nice people like your SIL and don\u2019t mind doing her a favor by including you since you are probably a nice person too and not difficult to hang out with. But no one wants you there so badly that they\u2019ll plan something just to have you there, especially if it means introducing multiple children into a social group that\u2019s just for adults to relax and have fun. You aren\u2019t an asshole really, but YTA is how to mark that you are in the wrong so there you go.\n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d do a light apology to your SIL, not over the top, just a \u201chey, I realized that I made things awkward when I asked about including the kids. I wasn\u2019t really thinking and of course it wouldn\u2019t make sense to do that. I hope you aren\u2019t annoyed and I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you including me up until now.\u201d Then think of these invites as a temporary stop gap until you can find friends more at your stage of life (kids)", "Yta to expect your SIL and her childless friend group  to cater to your children by doing \"child friendly\" activities for your convenience  they are being gracious extending you an invite and understanding that you cant always go If you want childfriendly activities look up local playgroups in your area and make mommy friends (if you find a good match you can also trade of babysitting duties so you can get out childfree more often). You're also the AH for even commenting that SIL doesn't watch your kids during family activities. It's not her responsibility.", "YTA. If you want kid friendly activities, you can plan something. SIL and her friends may not like that anyways but that will be a fair way for you to approach them rather than expecting people with no childcare experience to plan child friendly event.", "YTA - it's not your SILs responsibility to entertain or babysit you kids. She wants to spend time with her grownup friends, not make a playdate.", "YTA reluctantly because I\u2019ve seen this happen and it can be isolating to not have friends because being a mom changes everything but you can\u2019t ask a group of child free girls to include more kid friendly things because they are inviting you and not your kids, she doesn\u2019t have to help you with your kids or make accommodations with her friends for your kids.", "YTA. That\u2019s some audacity to ask a whole group of people you\u2019ve never met/barely know to change their dynamic because you have kids. Ask your family to babysit or hire a babysitter. \n\nFYI, she isn\u2019t inviting your kids; just you. That\u2019s why they aren\u2019t \u201cchild friendly\u201d activities. She\u2019s trying to give YOU a chance to get out and do things.", "YTA, she was trying to be nice, she keeps asking so if you get a sitter or something you can go,if none of them have kids it makes sense they do kid free activities", "YTA - nope,  most 20 something women have zero interest in doing child friendly things. If that\u2019s what you want then you organize something and you invite them. But don\u2019t expect people to organize their lives around YOU and YOUR choices", "Soft YTA\n\nLook. At the end of the day -- she is really sweet and kind for inviting you even though you generally have to decline. \n\nBut it's unreasonable to expect her, without kids, and her friends, also without, to cater to you when you aren't even really part of the group. \n\nThe only real reasonable/ easy solution here is if your actual BROTHER would offer to look after his niblings on such occasions.", "YTA. SIL doesn\u2019t have kids neither do her friends so why would they plan things that involve kids? Not everyone loves children.", "Soft YTA. As I get the loneliness factor in reverse. I\u2019m at an age where having chosen to be childless, my friends now have them. So I don\u2019t really see them unless I want to be surrounded by kids. Nope. Not my thing. \n\nHaving kids for most is a choice, and unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t something you asked for, but it has happened that you\u2019re a single parent. \n\nBut, similarly, those without children are entitled to enjoy their spare time as they will. Hence. Activities are not child friendly. \n\nYour SIL is still inviting you, so although it\u2019s difficult, she is trying. \n\nIt may change over time as people get older, settle down, however, perhaps if you can, ask any supporting family (brother, parents, maybe?) if they\u2019d be happy to take the kids once in a while. If it\u2019s genuinely once in a while, perhaps sleepover at grandparents would be fun? And you can go out with SIL?", "YTA but gentle. You should seek out mlms/parents parents of other kids to do stuff. Your SIL doesn't have kids and it's not reasonable to expect her to change her outings. Getting a sitter when you are able and joining her can help you keep your relationship with her.", "Gentle YTA - you and your SIL are at different places in your lives. I think it would be great if you could make some additional friends of your own who have kids, either through a parent Facebook group or with parents at your kids daycare or school, who will be more into doing kids activities and I am sure also appreciate having some adult interactions while the kids play. Best of luck to you.", "YTA.\n\nShe and her friends don't plan child-friendly trips because they have no children and enjoy things that aren't conducive to hauling children along for. You're an AH for suggesting that they should plan trips to amuse your children because that's not what they like and they have no obligation--and obviously no interest in--to plan around your children. Your SIL is being kind by always inviting you despite your lack of participation, because she understand your situation. It's incredibly selfish of you to expect them to change just to include your children.", "YTA they don't have kids. Why would they want to do \"kid friendly\" events? \n\nBeing a single mom is hard. However, the hard truth is that's not their problem. SIL is trying to include you, but you need to meet her halfway.", "NAH\n\n>Plus my SIL doesn't seem that interested in kids. She never helps or offers to help keep an eye on the kids during family gatherings.\n\nNONE of that is her responsibility. \n\nYou can ask her to have more kid-friendly activities, but she is entirely free to decline. And that seems to be what she did. I'd recommend that YOU plan some outings and invite friends rather than putting that planning on someone else.", "YTA. You can\u2019t expect a bunch of childless people to give up their non-child friendly plans that they enjoy so you can bring your children along.", "NAH. Not having kids is a very different walk of life, but that is very nice of her to invite you to things she is interested in. It can be very hard for someone without kids to come up with ideas that are child friendly. But, you're definitely not the AH either though because having to figure things out with the kids can be very tough. That's a good thing to suggest doing something more child friendly, and perhaps you can find something (like a lake day or smaller hikes that the kids can also enjoy) that she can bring her friends too as well!", "YTA. You, not your kids were invited. If you can\u2019t get a babysitter that\u2019s your issue. Don\u2019t expect a whole group to change their activities for you.", "YTA why are you trying to make her your event planner? She\u2019s inviting you to shit she\u2019s already doing. Stop trying to make it about you and forcing your kids on everyone. \n\nYou are a whole person, not just a mother.", "I would say that neither of you are really the Ahole here. Your sister in law isn't required to make her and her friends activities child friendly if none of them also have children. Also, have you tried maybe putting together activities or even suggesting specific ones.", "Is it just me that thinks if she was actually trying to be friends she'd at least just hang out for coffee or a picnic on occasion? It's not all the time and it was a suggestion after you've had to decline multiple times.\nIf she doesn't want to be around kids that's fair enough just be honest about it\nNta", "NAH here. You tried broaching the subject of more kid friendly activities, and she declined. As long as you leave it there and don\u2019t press the issue, it seems fine. \n\nGiven the age difference with her and your brother it woudl not surprise me if kids or not was maybe a sore subject with them but that\u2019s a complete guess as to why he made it a bigger deal than it had to be.", "NAH.\n\nI think it\u2019s okay to ask, but not okay to expect. And it\u2019s definitely not okay to expect outings other people organize to be organized around your kids!\n\nHow often have you invited her to do something that does work for you? You can\u2019t take that many littles on a long hike, but there are short walks with snacks that work pretty well. Or a half day at a small beach. \n\nBoating would depend entirely on your comfort level - I know families that have the infant life jackets and think nothing more of taking a tiny baby on a boat than taking them to a park, and I know families where that is absolutely unthinkable.\n\nWhale watching, if it\u2019s available near you might work well.\n\nGet yourself out, consider anything you do out of the house a success, and remind yourself that they will not be so small and so hard to take out for too much longer. My 8 year old is at the point where she has neighborhood friends and has to be called in for dinner and I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m finally getting out of the little kid arena where everything I did had to be appropriate for a small child.", "Nah\n\nYou asked and got your answer. You'd be an ah if you pushed it further.\n\nMaybe you could hire a baby sitter or plan stuff yourself with her?", "YTA\n\n>Plus my SIL doesn't seem that interested in kids. She never helps or offers to help keep an eye on the kids during family gatherings.\n\nYou seem pretty judgmental about that. As if you are entitled to free childcare from your SIL.\n\nNewsflash: Not everyone is interested in kids. You are not entitled to free childcare.\n\nAnd you seem to judge your Sil very harshly for this, since she is a woman. You don't seem to judge your brother for not providing free childcare. This is very sexist. Sadly, you seem to believe in patriarchal 'woman = mother' bullshit.\n\nNewsflash: 'woman' and 'mother' are NOT synonyms. Not all women are maternal. Not all women love kids. Not all women have to worship your kids and provide free childcare.\n\nNot her children, not her responsibility.", "NAH - just a little misunderstanding. Why not tell her- I love that you invite me. I so want to come everything but I can only make a few. Please don't stop inviting me as I know I can rarely go. But kids and all ya know.   \n\nJust have her be your adult friends away from kids friends.  Yeah you can rarely go- but so what. What if they have kids some time?", "YTA. If you want child friendly activities,  YOU should plan them and invite others.", "NTA for asking, just don't push the issue. You should find some mom friends though.", "YTA. First, she doesn't have to offer to keep an eye on your kids during family gatherings. \n\nSecond, it's not realistic to expect a group of mid 20 somethings to want to participate in child friendly activities. Especially when they don't have kids themselves.", "YTA for suggesting that a group of child free 20-somethings plan child-friendly events to accommodate you.

It\u2019s sad that the child free things SIL is organising aren\u2019t compatible with your life stage, but that\u2019s not her fault or responsibility. \n\nI have three kids myself and when they were young it did feel like we were unable to socialise with many of our friends. That was temporary and now our kids are older and they have young kids we can do more things together.", "You want a bunch of other people's friends, who don't have kids, to do kid-friendly activities so you can have a social life without effort. Id that makes YTA pretty clearly. Find your own group of people who do have kids and want to do kid friendly things.", "NTA intentiomally but I agree with your brother. if you want kid friendly activities, plan them and invite her.", "I'm leaning towards NAH.  \n\nYou asked, she said no and you let it go.  It doesn't sound like you nagged or whined about it.  And I can't really blame your SIL and her friends for not wanting three kids to tag along.  If your kids did tag along, chances are, you'd need a couple of them to help you since you can really only hold one kid at a time.\n\nCan your brother or another family member watch your kids for a day so that you could join them once in a while?", "YTA. If you want to do kid-friendly activities and hang out with her, take the initiative and invite her somewhere with the kids! Don't ask her to curate her invitations to you specifically; be proactive and invite her to do something that you actually can participate in.", "YTA. If you want your kids there so badly, why don\u2019t YOU plan something and invite them.", "Nobody is the asshole. You are simply at different stages of life. I was a parent way before anyone else in my friend group so I can relate. It\u2019s not fun to be the person left out. \n\nThe people interested in going to wineries and kayaking are not interested in hanging out at kid friendly places. One day, when they have children, they will understand. Their priorities will change rapidly and all of a sudden the wineries become the trampoline park and Little League games.\n\nI would encourage you to find a new friends group of people in your stage of life. Seek out other friends with kids so you can all do fun activities together. Next time the SIL asks just say you have your children and are unable to go. If she doesn\u2019t understand, that\u2019s on her.", "YTA. \n\nYour children- your problem. \n\nYour SIL is kind and thoughtful, she\u2019s including you often and doesn\u2019t have to.", "Or maybe she would be okay with going along with a kid-friendly plan, but doesn't want to put the energy into making plans specifically around the kids/doesn't know what would work for them. I notice OP doesn't mention ever having made plans and inviting SIL along. She's putting all the effort in, and OP's asking her to put in even more.", "And she's certainly not interested in making her friends spend time with someone else's kids.", "Thank you for your comments. You're right. I do need to find some more mom friends.", "I'm sorry if it came across like I was expecting her to babysit or watch my kids. I certainly don't. I just made that comment because I thought it might be relevant towards the situation.", ">egocentric to expect a group of people to do things that only appeal to you, and it's unrealistic to expect her to coerce her childless friends to do the child friendly activities you want when it clearly isn't their thing. \n\nThis is a perfect description of how OP's action came across to me when I read the post. I also think OP doesn't seem to get that SIL isn't interested in interacting with OP's children.", "Thank you for your insight. I apologize if it came off as me expecting my family to babysit. I hardly ever ask unless it's an emergency. I made the comment about my sister not interacting with them much at gatherings because I thought it might be relevant. I wasn't sure how to word it.", "Thank you. My finances are a little tight for a babysitter regularly, although I get one when I can. My husband and I are divorced and he lives in another state. I think I will just have to politely decline and hope that when they get older I might have a little more freedom.", "Thank you for all of your thoughts and suggestions. I honestly can't tell with my SIL if she actually wants me there or if she is just inviting me because she is a nice person. The two times I've been able to go with them they were all extremely welcoming. I do think I should apologize to her though and I will.", "This! I feel like this is the perfect examples of no good deed goes unpunished. SIL was trying to be nice by inviting OP on outings with her friends. OP should have just said no insteaad of suggesting that SIL and her friend plan child friendly activities. OP isn't friends with these people. So there is no incentive for them to want to alter their plans just so OP can hangout with them. SIL was just trying to be nice I doubt she cares if OP comes. I do think this is a situation where it hurts to ask because OP really thought a  group of childfree people who are not her friends would want to do child friendly activities just so she could attend.", "Or hell, maybe SIL would go along with a plan that involves the kids if OP actually took the initiative and invited her! Why is the impetus entirely on SIL to plan everything? OP is just as capable of picking up the phone and saying 'hey the kids and I are doing X on Saturday, we'd love it if you could come!'", "You're right. I have planned a few things, like asking my SIL if she wants to come to the zoo with us or do something small and sometimes she comes but most of the time she doesn't.", "Thank you. It's hard to hear but it is really helpful. It has become really isolating.", "He has on very rare occasions but he works a lot and often goes with on these outings so he normally isn't an option.", "You're right. I definitely need to expand out and get some more mom friends. I just need to expand a bit.", "Oh no. They are both happily childfree. My brother is more involved with the kids than my SIL but he says he likes giving them back. I don't plan on pressing the issue anymore, but thank you for your comments.", "I agree, OP is NTA for saying it'd be nice if once in a while an activity were more kid friendly so she could go. People are acting like she demanded SIL change her whole lifestyle - she didn't. She made a comment, it was rejected, that was that. People are also ignoring the fact that while it *is* nice that SIL is trying to include OP, she needs to understand that the things she's inviting her to aren't feasible. It would be a very kind gesture to occasionally plan an activity that OP could attend. Kid friendly doesn't mean kid-centric. SIL doesn't have to do this, obviously, but it would be a nice thing to do.", "Hiring a baby sitter for three kids is a little out of my budget. I do okay but all three are in daycare right now and it's hard to come up with extra money except for every once in a while.", "This is overthinking it. Seems like SIL keeps the invitation open, but doesn\u2019t judge if OP can\u2019t make it. \n\nIt would be worse if SIL just stopped inviting OP. Seems like SIL is being pretty reasonable here. \n\nI like the idea of OP planning something and then inviting SIL.", "I have thought about her maybe not really wanting me there but if she doesn't then she hides it well. She is always very friendly at family gatherings. I've tried inviting her to a couple things with me and the kids but she doesn't come to those very often.", "My brother will watch my kids but once in a very great while. He works long hours plus he goes to a lot of these activities himself. You're right though. I feel like I need to have a talk with my SIL. And I definitely need to apologize for overstepping.", "My brother has watched my kids but on very rare occasions. He goes on these outings a lot too but he also works a lot so a lot of times he can't. My parents both work full time so I hesitate to ask them.", "Yes. And apologize to her ASAP! Please express your gratitude and say that you think the world of her for offering to include you in any of her activities. So few people are inclusive like that AT ALL", "Try looking for mom groups in your area on [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com), check the local paper if there is one, the grocery store notice board if there is one, and search on Facebook. The teachers at a local preschool might also be able to point you toward such a group.", "INFO is there any family willing to watch the kids while you hang out with SIL and her friends?", "You could have just said she isn't interested in children.", "It's sexist to include that little tid bit. You say in a comment that your brother isn't offering to mind your children either, but you only seem to think she, a woman, is acting unfriendly for not wanting to help with children at family gatherings.\n\nIt reeks of \"she's a woman, children are women's work, all women should be interested in children\"", "What you said was thoughtless at best. Most likely she will stop inviting you to anything (it was extremely nice of her to try to include you in the first place). If you want a chance of her including you again, you owe her a big apology for overstepping.", "I get that.  Some people aren't kid people.  I have a friend that never had kids and doesn't really like them.  She and I are great friends and do many things that we enjoy while the kids are with friends or busy.  I think your sister-in-law is wanting you to go out with them because she enjoys your company, but if she is uncomfortable with littles, that doesn't make her a bad person.  Find a sitter and enjoy!!", ">I hardly ever ask unless it's an emergency\n\nHow many emergencies does one person have in 5 years? Like one or two?", "My apologies, I missed the divorce part. Now, do YOU want to hang out with SIL and her friends? If so it would be worth asking your brother if he could babysit on a special occasion to get you out of the house.", "Your ex should is paying child support and seeing them when he can at least right?", "Well keep in mind, I only have a couple of paragraphs to go off of. You are there in person and living the situation so your assessment is the more accurate one. I\u2019m mostly going off the fact that when you turn her down because it\u2019s not possible, she doesn\u2019t do anything to make it possible for you to come - to me that reads like they are going whether or not you can because seeing you isn\u2019t the goal of the get together. That in no way means she doesn\u2019t generally like and care about you though! It\u2019s probably just that she likes this group and it\u2019s activities as it is.", "This is such an unfortunate situation. :( \n\nThere was another AITA situation where the OP had a friend with multiple kids (the friend had no partner and no funds for daycare) and the consensus was the OP wasn't this person's friend just sort of forced to be friends with this Mom because the group was. OP decided to stop inviting them. It was slightly more complex because the kids destroyed some expensive furniture.\n\nI think if someone REALLY wants to be friends they'll try their best to figure out a situation that works for BOTH parties.\n\nIt's up to you but someone else suggested maybe inviting your brother and SIL over for movie and a pizza. See how they respond to that. Maybe it'll turn into a Friday night thing they enjoy doing with you and the kids.", "Frankly, most adults won't see taking children to a zoo as fun.", "Ask her if she wants to go to An art museum. My 4 year old and 2 year o ld love art museums. It\u2019s different than going with adults. There\u2019s a different pace. So don\u2019t try to take them with her friends but ask her and your brother.", "Invite her over to hang out after the kids go to bed or on a nice evening when they can play outside and you can chat.  These times with little ones are lonely, but it does get easier when the kids are in school and activities.  You can sit on the sidelines and chat with other parents while you watch their games.", "I get it, I have a few friends that have kids and even though we still hang out from time to time our dynamic has changed a bit, and that\u2019s okay, my friend group is mostly child free but we still try to accommodate the kids but sometimes we want to just drink and relax and with kids there is a bit more difficult. I would honestly ask some of your family members to help watch the kids for a few hours and you can go and have some fun!", "Well maybe talk to him and see if he might be willing to on some occasions... But honestly, I think it's just one of those life stages things. I wouldn't want to stay home from something fun to babysit! \n\nOnce they are a little older it may get easier for them to be with other friends while you go out for example. \n\nOr maybe there will be one of these family friendly breweries that open up near you! \n\nI'd also encourage you to see if you can organize something - even small - that would be fun for a non parent to hang out, and just invite your SIL to keep fostering the friendship she's trying to establish.\n\nShe doesn't have to want to hang out with kids to be a good SIL or friend. Kids aren't for everyone and there's nothing wrong with that. Esp at that age where many ppl simply haven't spent much time w kids so aren't comfortable with them.", "Yeah that's fair enough then. Maybe you can come up with some activities that is fun for everyone and includes the kids.", "If she didn\u2019t want you there, she would have stopped inviting you. With this comment, you come across as trying to make yourself the victim in your relationship with her when everything you\u2019ve said indicates that she values you and genuinely wants to spend time with you. She doesn\u2019t need to help or offer her help to watch your kids at family events. She doesn\u2019t need to plan out kid friendly activities to cater exclusively to you", "Not really. My brother watches them on very rare occasions because he works long hours and often goes to these activities himself. My parents both still work full time so I don't really like asking them for help unless it's an emergency.", "Yes that definitely describes her. She has never said anything about not liking children, just that she doesn't want them. Unfortunately a sitter is a bit out of my budget most of the time but I will start putting away some money so I can have me time once in a while.", "Yes I would love to hang out with them more. They are a really fun bunch of people. My brother has babysit for me once but he also works a lot and a lot of times he is also going along with these outings so it doesn't feel fair to ask him too often.", "He is paying child support but hasn't seen them since he left.", "Oh I really like the idea of having her over for a late night cocktail after the kids have gone to bed! They are all good sleepers thank god. LoL", "I've invited my SIL along to some kid activities and she has come a few times but it's just rough, you know? It's hard to watch three kids by myself and carry on a conversation. But that's not her issue or problem.", "Is there any reason you can't get a babysitter once in awhile? Not a family member, just paying someone to watch your kids for a few hours. \n\nBecause it seems like your SIL is making an active effort in reaching out to you, but you don't seem willing to make any effort to meet her halfway.", "Maybe brother should help a sister out once in a while by taking the kids once in a while.", "If you join a mom group, you could find someone who wants to swap off babysitting her kids for taking yours on another day.", "and there u have it u just said it.  the SIL doesnt want children but she likes u and wants to include u and honestly i think she is rather polite but saying each time i understand when u have to say u cant join them.  she is also too kind to say she doesnt like kids, it should be understood whenone says they dont want any.  perhaps finding new friends that have kids ?  that way you can have play dates etc.", "Have you considered organizing an event that would work for you and your kids and then inviting SIL and her friends? Honestly, the thing that stands out as the most rude and self-centered part of your story is that you expect SIL and her friends to do all of the planning so that you can just show up to an event that suits you. If there is a type of event that you want to attend, you need to take the initiative to plan it. Even just taking the initiative to google \u201ckid friendly hikes near me\u201d and inviting SIL to do one of those hikes with you would be a great start. Or if there are things you and your kids like and you think SIL might like to come along and do the activity with you\u2026then you can just take the initiative and invite her. Friendships eventually die out if one person has to do all of the work and the other person just takes it for granted.", "It is hard to not get a break or be able to have a conversation with another adult. It does get isolating and isolation gets depressing. It\u2019s hard to be a village. Hold in there, though! Your kids will be grown up soon enough! My child is a teenager. I had him in my young 20s. My best friend waited until 35. Roles reversed. Now she\u2019s like \u201cOhh\u2026I get what you meant.\u201d lol", "Then how would you handle it if they did a kid friendly event? How would you interact with an entire child free group with three kids in tow?", "That's a good thing to keep in mind. Thank you! I know it's a tough ask watching three at this age but I am more than happy to swap off.", "I actually have invited my SIL along to do activities with us. She has only come twice on her own. Sometimes she will come over with my brother for dinner or something similar but he comes on his own more often."]}
