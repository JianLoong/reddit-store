Her kids were 4 and 2 when they met and her husband's son was 7. They married after 8 months of being together. Her stepson did not accept my sister or her kids well. My sister told me and our parents her family was going through \"some growing pains\" and that her stepson might have an attitude for a while but to please make him feel welcomed and loved. A couple of years after they got married my sister and her husband became foster parents. My sister's husband adopted her older kids. Her stepson didn't want to be adopted and showed a lot of anger about bringing more kids into the house. Things were messy. Her stepson was acting out a lot and was finding a lot of excuses not to be home. She would say things like \"he just needs time\" or \"oh you know how boys can be\". She and her husband put him in therapy when it got so bad he was staying in his room all the time and locking the door. Honestly, my parents and I were concerned about the suitability for them to have vulnerable foster kids added into the mix and we spoke to the case worker but they were still considered better than nobody.\n\nThey ended up adopting from foster care three times. Two bio siblings, a little girl with special needs and a boy who was only a baby. They continued fostering alongside the adoptions.\n\nMy sister's stepson is now 16. My sister and her husband have tried to give him more responsibilities within the family and have tried to get him to spend time with all the additional siblings, for a chance to bond. A few weeks ago he was asked to stay home with the kids for 40 minutes while his dad went to work, that my sister would be home then. He left once his dad was out of sight and my sister got home to the other kids, who are 13 and under, home alone. My sister was so upset and called her husband. He ended up taking the day off work and he found his son and dragged him home. They argued and my sister was trying to talk to him, hoping he would say why. He either ignores her or says he doesn't have to tell her anything, that she's not his mother or his parent or his family. It's been weeks of this. My sister is still upset. CPS was made aware of what happened by one of the foster kids and nothing was done, they said it could happen in any family. \n\nMy sister has been very upset about her stepson's unwillingness to discuss things with her. She told me she has tried multiple times to get him to open up to her and he just won't and how it's stressing her the fuck out. I let her talk a few times, I offered her comfort. But now it has become a fixation and I can't help but notice it's distracting her from the other kids. So the last time she brought it up I told her she needs to give in and accept her stepson isn't going to talk to her and that she needs to leave that to her husband. She told me he's one of her kids and she can't just leave it or accept it.

His dad remarried before he was even done grieving, his new life involves a whole mess of kids and I am sure his dad is split time-wise and cant give the 16-year-old full attention. And then you add MORE KIDS.  \n\nChildren in very stable loving homes without death or remarriage act like this when foster kids or adopted kids are added in. It is a normal reaction.  \n\nthe 16 year olds reaction to your sister is also fairly normal.  \n\nWhat you said to your sister is just fine. A little- hey you have to understand and have empathy.

While his father absolutely had the right to date and remarry after being widowed, standard advice is not to even introduce a child to a new romantic interest until you've been with them for at least six months (to ensure that the relationship is a serious and stable one), and then to do so slowly and thoughtfully, so as to give the child time to get comfortable with having this new adult in their life in the fraught emotional situation where their family dynamic is changing significantly. \n\nThey did everything in the worst possible way, bringing not only your sister but her children into this little boy's life much too quickly, upending his whole world with a marriage, major household changes (and with them obviously changes in routine, privacy, time with his dad, etc.). And then within only a couple of years they filled the house with not only MORE children, but children who likely had intense emotional needs, meaning that his life was made even more chaotic and he became less and less of a priority. And your sister tried to justify this by saying that they then dumped some of the responsibility for those kids on him?!! \n\nAt every step along the way they have deprioritised this kid's needs, his emotional well-being, and his best interests.

Why are they so shocked that he left?\n\nThey choose to foster and adopt. That's means they're responsible.  What would dad have done is 16yo wasn't home?  That's what he should have done.", "NTA - your sister came to you with complaints and was looking for advice, though you were blunt, at this point it sounds like you might be right", "NTA - your sisters persistence in the mom/son relationship is only driving a bigger wedge. I lost my mom young and my dad dated a series of women over the years till he died. Not a single single one of them ever felt like mom. At 7 he was old enough to know that mom/son bond and no woman is ever gonna take that place. Your sister sounds like a good woman but she needs to acknowledge that she will never be his mom and she needs to tell him that and say it to him and that might heal the rift and allow a meaningful relationship to form.", "NTA the more she pushes the more he's going to go no contact when he's 18.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a hot mess, OP, as is her husband. This poor kid lost his mom, then had the traumatic experience of having a stepmother and stepsiblings forced on him after your sister had only been dating his father for a short time. What SHOULD have happened was lots of therapy for him and the entire family. I'm guessing that didn't happen.\n\nInstead of focusing on the three kids they did have, one of whom was in serious pain and distress, your sister and BIL decided to adopt a bunch more kids from foster care, kids they clearly are not able to handle parenting if they are dumping the responsibility for caring for them on the now 16-year-old child. \n\nHe should not be forced to babysit. He should be given therapy, attention from his dad if it's not too late to fix all the ways he and your sister have screwed up his childhood, and they need to stop parentificating him.

Literally ignoring family members telling them these two are not good fits for adoption or fostering.", "Which is obviously not ideal, but apparently it's their best option, so how has she done something bad to them?", "She shouldn\u2019t have even met his son till they were together minimum six months to a year and they got married in eight months? What a shitshow. NTA", " If he manages to not take off before 18 he will the minute he graduates and hits that 18th bday. Also, forcing him to watch step siblings he has no interest in will not help them bond.", "Then give him the pleasure. I just think she should stop trying so hard with him and leave him own his own.", "I don't think you understood my point. I said parents are AHs for bringing more and more kids. But he needs to grow up and at least respect the woman who is \"trying\" with him. Either you're a spoiled child or an entitled American. If it were asian parents they would've whopped this kid's ass.", "Yes I think they're teenagers. They can be held responsible for their actions atleast. I'm not saying ask him to pay rent but least he could do is be respectful. It's about being old enough to be respectful of someone", "He did scream at her. That was the whole point. He screamed at her that she isn't his mom, or family or anything. And honestly I would respect someone if they're not harming me, it's basic human decency. If his step mom is abusive, he has every right to call her out", "You don't get a teenager that is already mad and dediant to stay and watch kids when it's been made clear that they won't. \n\nAlso 13 is old enough to babysit in my province.", " actually cares about what the child thinks.\n\nDo they ignore their foster children's feelings as well?", " He had issues from the beginning yet fostered and adopted more children?!? I can see him cutting them off once he is 18.", "100% NTA.", "Yes also I was babysitting other kids , including infants at 12. I know that\u2019s not commonly done anymore but 40 minutes with a 13 year old isn\u2019t that bad really.", "Oh I understood your post. Just think you're dead wrong. The stepson didn't ask for this. The parents did. They made tense situation worse. None of the blame is on the stepson, or any of the other kids. All of it is on the parents. \n\nThe kid will grow up all right. He'll turn 18, leave and never come back. The parents will be lucky to get a damn Christmas card from the stepson as far as I'm concerned. \n\nThat woman btw, is the root of the poor kid's shitty life. You're acting as if the stepson is lashing out because he didn't get a PS5. He's lashing out because no once cares about what he wants, and he doesn't want to play family. \n\nYou've got no empathy whatsoever for the stepson. If you ask real nice, maybe op's will adopt you too.", "Why would you respect someone who repeatedly stomps on your boundaries and refuses to snap out of their delusion that you have a happy family when clearly you don't?", ">He either ignores her or says he doesn\u2019t have to tell her anything, that she\u2019s not his mother or his parent or his family.\n\nWhere\u2019s the screaming? Is it in another post, because that\u2019s not what OP wrote?\n\nNot harming you is basic human decency, but it doesn\u2019t equate to respect.", "They're basically hoarding children and then expecting that he babysit them \"to bond\". If they want all the kids so bad then they should figure it out, not expect that the one kid that's not on board with any of that to babysit.", "The real important questions. Does the sister want him as her son or a free baby sitter?", "Okay so you're saying just because I have a kid and my spouse dies or I get divorced, I should stop my life? Like I have no right to love someone ever again? Because oh well how will my child react? And if that person is trying to be nice to my kid, I should give up on my life and arrange everything around him? Just because he didn't ask to be born?  I didn't ask for my spouse to die or me to get divorced either. But sometimes shit happens", "Sweetie it's said no man is perfect but a trying man is something. You do realise she is trying to make him happy? How did she cross his boundaries exactly? Tell me? Is it too much to ask someone just to \"stay at home\" for a while until we get back? I just think Americans are super entitled people if they think this is \"boundaries\".", "Sorry my mistake about using the word scream. I was also engaging in some other post as well. Sorry.   \nWhat I mean was he's plane rude to her. He just needs to consider her as human.", "I don't know, maybe the fact that she's spent a decade trying to force this \"perfect family\" narrative onto her stepson who was clearly against it from the start, on top of adding in several more random children to further her \"blended family\" ideal? There is so much more at play beyond the fact that he refused to do something she asked. This woman has clearly been pushing him too hard for comfort for several years.", "Fair enough.\n\nHe is being rude to her, but his father and her have failed him every step of the way.\n\nThey\u2019ve not respected him enough to not rush into a relationship, to foster other children when he was already uncomfortable with his step-siblings, and by then expecting him to babysit those children.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the stepmother in the wrong though, his father isn\u2019t blameless. I\u2019m just more willing to give the 16yo some leeway in being angry and rude."]}
