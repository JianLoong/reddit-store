Her kids were 4 and 2 when they met and her husband's son was 7. They married after 8 months of being together. Her stepson did not accept my sister or her kids well. My sister told me and our parents her family was going through \"some growing pains\" and that her stepson might have an attitude for a while but to please make him feel welcomed and loved. A couple of years after they got married my sister and her husband became foster parents. My sister's husband adopted her older kids. Her stepson didn't want to be adopted and showed a lot of anger about bringing more kids into the house. Things were messy. Her stepson was acting out a lot and was finding a lot of excuses not to be home. She would say things like \"he just needs time\" or \"oh you know how boys can be\". She and her husband put him in therapy when it got so bad he was staying in his room all the time and locking the door. Honestly, my parents and I were concerned about the suitability for them to have vulnerable foster kids added into the mix and we spoke to the case worker but they were still considered better than nobody.\n\nThey ended up adopting from foster care three times. Two bio siblings, a little girl with special needs and a boy who was only a baby. They continued fostering alongside the adoptions.\n\nMy sister's stepson is now 16. My sister and her husband have tried to give him more responsibilities within the family and have tried to get him to spend time with all the additional siblings, for a chance to bond. A few weeks ago he was asked to stay home with the kids for 40 minutes while his dad went to work, that my sister would be home then. He left once his dad was out of sight and my sister got home to the other kids, who are 13 and under, home alone. My sister was so upset and called her husband. He ended up taking the day off work and he found his son and dragged him home. They argued and my sister was trying to talk to him, hoping he would say why. He either ignores her or says he doesn't have to tell her anything, that she's not his mother or his parent or his family. It's been weeks of this. My sister is still upset. CPS was made aware of what happened by one of the foster kids and nothing was done, they said it could happen in any family. \n\nMy sister has been very upset about her stepson's unwillingness to discuss things with her. She told me she has tried multiple times to get him to open up to her and he just won't and how it's stressing her the fuck out. I let her talk a few times, I offered her comfort. But now it has become a fixation and I can't help but notice it's distracting her from the other kids. So the last time she brought it up I told her she needs to give in and accept her stepson isn't going to talk to her and that she needs to leave that to her husband. She told me he's one of her kids and she can't just leave it or accept it.

His dad remarried before he was even done grieving, his new life involves a whole mess of kids and I am sure his dad is split time-wise and cant give the 16-year-old full attention. And then you add MORE KIDS.  \n\nChildren in very stable loving homes without death or remarriage act like this when foster kids or adopted kids are added in. It is a normal reaction.  \n\nthe 16 year olds reaction to your sister is also fairly normal.  \n\nWhat you said to your sister is just fine. A little- hey you have to understand and have empathy.

While his father absolutely had the right to date and remarry after being widowed, standard advice is not to even introduce a child to a new romantic interest until you've been with them for at least six months (to ensure that the relationship is a serious and stable one), and then to do so slowly and thoughtfully, so as to give the child time to get comfortable with having this new adult in their life in the fraught emotional situation where their family dynamic is changing significantly. \n\nThey did everything in the worst possible way, bringing not only your sister but her children into this little boy's life much too quickly, upending his whole world with a marriage, major household changes (and with them obviously changes in routine, privacy, time with his dad, etc.). And then within only a couple of years they filled the house with not only MORE children, but children who likely had intense emotional needs, meaning that his life was made even more chaotic and he became less and less of a priority. And your sister tried to justify this by saying that they then dumped some of the responsibility for those kids on him?!! \n\nAt every step along the way they have deprioritised this kid's needs, his emotional well-being, and his best interests.

The kids were dumped on him by his dad.  Dad is at fault here.\n\nThey both know the 16yo doesn't consider any of them family.   Why are they so shocked that he left?\n\nThey choose to foster and adopt. That's means they're responsible.  What would dad have done is 16yo wasn't home?  That's what he should have done.", "NTA - your sister came to you with complaints and was looking for advice, though you were blunt, at this point it sounds like you might be right", "NTA - your sisters persistence in the mom/son relationship is only driving a bigger wedge. I lost my mom young and my dad dated a series of women over the years till he died. Not a single single one of them ever felt like mom. At 7 he was old enough to know that mom/son bond and no woman is ever gonna take that place. Your sister sounds like a good woman but she needs to acknowledge that she will never be his mom and she needs to tell him that and say it to him and that might heal the rift and allow a meaningful relationship to form.", "NTA the more she pushes the more he's going to go no contact when he's 18.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a hot mess, OP, as is her husband. This poor kid lost his mom, then had the traumatic experience of having a stepmother and stepsiblings forced on him after your sister had only been dating his father for a short time. What SHOULD have happened was lots of therapy for him and the entire family. I'm guessing that didn't happen.\n\nInstead of focusing on the three kids they did have, one of whom was in serious pain and distress, your sister and BIL decided to adopt a bunch more kids from foster care, kids they clearly are not able to handle parenting if they are dumping the responsibility for caring for them on the now 16-year-old child. \n\nHe should not be forced to babysit. He should be given therapy, attention from his dad if it's not too late to fix all the ways he and your sister have screwed up his childhood, and they need to stop parentificating him.

He knows he doesn't matter to them, that they only want him around so they look like some sort of saints for their blended family to others no matter how much harm they're actually causing each child, and that they resent the fact he resists their control over him.\n\nDay he turns 18 will be the last time any of them ever see him.", "NTA\n\n\"Sorry sis unfortunately he is NOT one of your kids and DOESN'T want to be one of your kids. The problem is that YOU have ignored and been dismissive of his feelings and wants from the beginning. How did you expect him to feel.\n\nThat energy you have wasted on him could have been put to good use on one of the other children in your home. \n\nLet it go or stop talking to me about it. Please.\"", "NTA. But your sister and BIL are. They got married after 8 months?! A lot of kids wouldn't deal well with that. Then after he's not adjusting well they decide to foster? And then adopt? Why can't they let this poor kid have any time to adjust before throwing more people at him. \n\nAlso they're idiots if they need to be told why he didn't want to watch all those kids.", "NTA but she has to accept that the stepson wants nothing to do with her or the kids. This all happened to him when he was 7 and they married only 8 months after they met.  This child never accepted them and never will.", "Dude. I wouldn\u2019t want to be part of that blended family either. Maybe he would have come around without the foster/adoption developments. Maybe. But honestly, you knew you had a kid struggling to adapt and you never stopped throwing changes at him and expecting more and more from him. \n\nShe needs to let him go. It\u2019s not even about him anymore. Now it\u2019s just a power struggle to get her \u201cperfect\u201d family. NTA.", "NTA, she needs to understand by holding on she's pushing him away. In the end it'll be her fault and then what? Stand back and respect his boundaries.", "I\u2019m shaking my head right now. Your sister married a man after 8 months with a child that doesn\u2019t accept her. Answer? Let\u2019s foster two more kids ( one special needs)because he\u2019s just having growing pains. Kid continues to act out and therapy isn\u2019t helping. Answer ? Adopt said foster children and foster MORE children giving troubled child babysitting responsibilities. Child continues to hate his stepmom and continues to act out. \n\nThat poor kid. Your sister and her husband have some serious issues with dealing with reality. They should have never fostered and NEVER adopted without fixing what was seriously broken that home and in their collective heads. That kid should run at 18 and never look back. They\u2019re no saints and in actuality, they\u2019re villains.", "NTA \n\nI feel bad for the kid. They're not actually listening to him or his needs just keep forcing what they want and hoping he'll just submit. He's dipping and not looking back as soon as he can", "This is not amazing if it comes at the expense of your existing children.", "NTA\n\nThis is just a whole mess of a situation.", " It seems like the sister and her husband tried to force the relationship which just causes resentment.", "the fostering doesn\u2019t sound lovely in this scenario even though in reality there are a lot of really unfit households. they sound impulsive. instead of fixing the problem with the stepson they buried it with more kids to start over with ones that might be less faulty. screw that", "He would not stay with me or my parents if he was given the choice. He doesn't like us, wants to not be around us and would not respond well to the suggestion. But I do think if he was offered a place to stay at a friend's house indefinitely, he would jump at it.", "The stepson never has agreed to watch the kids, his dad and stepmom just dump them on him and emotionally neglect him", " The neglect started with BIL's bio child.", "So I'm other words, he discounted his son's actual feelings about it because *he* liked the idea so much. And it was, as I said, too fast. Might not have mattered, but IMHO would have been better to move a little more slowly and take his son's feelings into consideration.", "He was happy to have someone to sleep with and didn\u2019t give a shit what his son felt or thought about the relationship.", "Sounds like neither parent, nor step-parent, actually cares about what the child thinks.\n\nDo they ignore their foster children's feelings as well?", "*facepalm*", "Fair enough. \n\nGood on you for supporting a kid that doesn\u2019t necessarily like you. That\u2019s not an easy thing to do, but thankfully there is one adult in this stupid situation that is actually thinking about him.", "You can point out that he may start following other children, even hitting them", "We have no way of knowing from what OP posted whether it was actually \u201ctoo fast\u201d or something his son would have ever accepted under any circumstances", "That poor kid. His dad and your sister keep making all these decisions never considering the impact to him. 8 months? There was absolutely no reason they had to move that fast.\n\nTHEY want one big happy family, THEY want the son to open up to her. THEY want the son to love their siblings. THEY wanted a house full of kids.\n\nThey just assume every decision they make is the best for everyone when in reality, it only best for them.\n\nThe thing is, they might have gotten what they all wanted if they didn't move so quickly and didn't try to force all of this on the kid against his will. They did everything wrong.\n\nNow he just feels abandoned and powerless. He lost his mom and now his dad basically emotionally abandoned him in exchange for a long list of new kids. That kid shut down his emotions ages ago and forcing him into family time is only making it worse.\n\nYour sister needs to leave that poor kid alone.", "Okay so he has no bio family except his dad but he's still a brat? Can I be honest? I think this kid needs to learn to respect his parents, He doesn't have to accept her as his mother but \"respect\" is bare minimum. She should stop doing things for him, he doesn't consider her anything? Good he's not a child he can cook for himself, clean, do his own laundry, his own shopping for groceries, his own everything. He doesn't want anything to do with her, she shouldn't, just leave him alone and silent treatment.\nAnd they didn't have to bring in more kids, what are they? Idiots? Their pre existing kids are \"difficult\", why traumatise already traumatised kids? I think both are AHs here. The kid, who isn't actually a child anymore and the parents because they keep making more difficult for him.", "There are multiple ways to care about someone, and sometimes the best way is not to directly tackle their bad decisions but to say \u201clook, I love you, but I can\u2019t be your sounding board for this\u201d. Pushing people to take some space away from thinking and focusing solely on a toxic relationship of any kind by insisting on a boundary like that does more for their self-reflection than a \u201creasons you suck\u201d speech. It\u2019s how you support people in toxic relationships without being sucked in, or in abusive relationships without being cut out, and it\u2019s how you support and love people who are making bad decisions but will entrench when argued with. She is obviously a person who entrenches when argued with.", "FOUR more kids!", "even if he never accepted it, if you don\u2019t even allow the step children time to adjust to the idea you\u2019re running a huge risk or a dysfunctional house. way too many blended families start with blissful parents who don\u2019t experiment with how the actual household dynamic will play out and then they\u2019re stuck with a toxic environment because they didn\u2019t consider the other factors. then they added FOUR MORE children before they made sure the environment was going to adjust. these people sound extremely impulsive", "Plus, she\u2019s brought foster and adopted children into a very negative situation.", "I couldn't have said this better.  I'm heartbroken for that boy.", "Holy headcanon way to give your own fabricated take on how stepson feels. Lol", "They never let that happen even though it was difficult for him right at the beginning when they married. They blew right through all that and added more kids into the mix.", "I THOUGHT THE SAME THING!! I'm like YIKES! 8 months only!? There's no reason they had to get married UNDER A YEAR. plus every time they adopted more and more kids I kept thinking \"and did u ever consider how he feels AT ALL!?!\" ITS on them. They want it their way, their time, and then wonder why the hell he doesn't want anything to do with them.", "You are so mistaken if you think 16 year olds aren't still children.", "At 16 he's finally old enough to babysit and all of a sudden stepmom wants him to \"spend time with\" and \"bond with\" his younger siblings. Not much of a mystery..."]}
