Her kids were 4 and 2 when they met and her husband's son was 7. They married after 8 months of being together. Her stepson did not accept my sister or her kids well. My sister told me and our parents her family was going through \"some growing pains\" and that her stepson might have an attitude for a while but to please make him feel welcomed and loved. A couple of years after they got married my sister and her husband became foster parents. My sister's husband adopted her older kids. Her stepson didn't want to be adopted and showed a lot of anger about bringing more kids into the house. Things were messy. Her stepson was acting out a lot and was finding a lot of excuses not to be home. She would say things like \"he just needs time\" or \"oh you know how boys can be\". She and her husband put him in therapy when it got so bad he was staying in his room all the time and locking the door. Honestly, my parents and I were concerned about the suitability for them to have vulnerable foster kids added into the mix and we spoke to the case worker but they were still considered better than nobody.\n\nThey ended up adopting from foster care three times. Two bio siblings, a little girl with special needs and a boy who was only a baby. They continued fostering alongside the adoptions.\n\nMy sister's stepson is now 16. My sister and her husband have tried to give him more responsibilities within the family and have tried to get him to spend time with all the additional siblings, for a chance to bond. A few weeks ago he was asked to stay home with the kids for 40 minutes while his dad went to work, that my sister would be home then. He left once his dad was out of sight and my sister got home to the other kids, who are 13 and under, home alone. My sister was so upset and called her husband. He ended up taking the day off work and he found his son and dragged him home. They argued and my sister was trying to talk to him, hoping he would say why. He either ignores her or says he doesn't have to tell her anything, that she's not his mother or his parent or his family. It's been weeks of this. My sister is still upset. CPS was made aware of what happened by one of the foster kids and nothing was done, they said it could happen in any family. \n\nMy sister has been very upset about her stepson's unwillingness to discuss things with her. She told me she has tried multiple times to get him to open up to her and he just won't and how it's stressing her the fuck out. I let her talk a few times, I offered her comfort. But now it has become a fixation and I can't help but notice it's distracting her from the other kids. So the last time she brought it up I told her she needs to give in and accept her stepson isn't going to talk to her and that she needs to leave that to her husband. She told me he's one of her kids and she can't just leave it or accept it.

The whole family needs to be on board when fostering and adopting. With each kid Sis and BIL added to the mix, they lost BIL's kid a little more...\n\nNTA for telling Sis it's too late...", "NTA - 9 years of living in this situation should have lended your sister to some form of acceptance or knowledge here.   \n\nThe kid is mad as hell. His dad remarried before he was even done grieving, his new life involves a whole mess of kids and I am sure his dad is split time-wise and cant give the 16-year-old full attention. And then you add MORE KIDS.  \n\nChildren in very stable loving homes without death or remarriage act like this when foster kids or adopted kids are added in. It is a normal reaction.  \n\nthe 16 year olds reaction to your sister is also fairly normal.  \n\nWhat you said to your sister is just fine. A little- hey you have to understand and have empathy.

It is very different.", "NTA\n\nWhat the stepson did with the foster kids was unacceptable but he's not one of the people we're judging here.

While his father absolutely had the right to date and remarry after being widowed, standard advice is not to even introduce a child to a new romantic interest until you've been with them for at least six months (to ensure that the relationship is a serious and stable one), and then to do so slowly and thoughtfully, so as to give the child time to get comfortable with having this new adult in their life in the fraught emotional situation where their family dynamic is changing significantly. \n\nThey did everything in the worst possible way, bringing not only your sister but her children into this little boy's life much too quickly, upending his whole world with a marriage, major household changes (and with them obviously changes in routine, privacy, time with his dad, etc.). And then within only a couple of years they filled the house with not only MORE children, but children who likely had intense emotional needs, meaning that his life was made even more chaotic and he became less and less of a priority. And your sister tried to justify this by saying that they then dumped some of the responsibility for those kids on him?!! \n\nAt every step along the way they have deprioritised this kid's needs, his emotional well-being, and his best interests.

The kids were dumped on him by his dad.  Dad is at fault here.\n\nThey both know the 16yo doesn't consider any of them family.   Why are they so shocked that he left?\n\nThey choose to foster and adopt. That's means they're responsible.  What would dad have done is 16yo wasn't home?  That's what he should have done.", "NTA - your sister came to you with complaints and was looking for advice, though you were blunt, at this point it sounds like you might be right", "NTA - your sisters persistence in the mom/son relationship is only driving a bigger wedge. I lost my mom young and my dad dated a series of women over the years till he died. Not a single single one of them ever felt like mom. At 7 he was old enough to know that mom/son bond and no woman is ever gonna take that place. Your sister sounds like a good woman but she needs to acknowledge that she will never be his mom and she needs to tell him that and say it to him and that might heal the rift and allow a meaningful relationship to form.", "NTA the more she pushes the more he's going to go no contact when he's 18.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a hot mess, OP, as is her husband. This poor kid lost his mom, then had the traumatic experience of having a stepmother and stepsiblings forced on him after your sister had only been dating his father for a short time. What SHOULD have happened was lots of therapy for him and the entire family. I'm guessing that didn't happen.\n\nInstead of focusing on the three kids they did have, one of whom was in serious pain and distress, your sister and BIL decided to adopt a bunch more kids from foster care, kids they clearly are not able to handle parenting if they are dumping the responsibility for caring for them on the now 16-year-old child. \n\nHe should not be forced to babysit. He should be given therapy, attention from his dad if it's not too late to fix all the ways he and your sister have screwed up his childhood, and they need to stop parentificating him.

Time will heal his 'wounds.' As he grows older he'll come to appreciate things better.\n\nYou probably enjoy fostering but he doesn't..", "She sounds delusional. Eventually none of her kids are gonna wanna have anything to do with her. Support them as you can", "I feel so bad for that little dude.", "L you are probably right, but it still might be worth offering, if you were willing. I can imagine it being incredibly valuable to him to know that someone sees how utterly crappy the situation forced on him is, even if that's someone he doesn't like.", "Having a child from a previous marriage does not mean you are obligated to never get remarried. As long as the person you remarry is a good role model to your kid, respects their right to privacy and for the first 2 or so years at least, avoid disciplining them. So I don't think the dad is an asshole.\n \nThe situation is even better if the step parent is willing to treat the stepchild as their own, which is what OP's sister has been trying to do for the last 9 years. She has been in his life, trying her best for longer than she wasn't. So she isn't an asshole either. \n\nAlso choosing to foster for the right reasons is inherently a good thing. It does seem like they did it for the right reasons considering they adopted them. You don't get paid after adoption. Volunteering to look after some of the country's most vulnerable children, who you are not even related to and being willing to keep a sibling group together and meet all of the high needs of another is the exact opposite of being an asshole. \n\nI feel like this comments section would probably have been more diverse if rather than fostering/adopting and their son taking issue with that, they had conceived their own biological children and the son had taken issue with that. I told my parents I didn't want to be a big sister when my mum was pregnant with my sister (I was 3). But my mum didn't give her away just because I said I didn't want to be a big sister. And now, 14 years later, me and my sister are extremely close. We always were. We don't expect pregnant women to go and abortions just because their older child says they don't want a younger sibling, so why should fostering and adopting be any different? \n\nOP was just stating what she had observed and concluded after nine years of first hand evidence, her sister's step son had rejected her everyday up until now and that is very unlikely to change now. Unfortunately, that is a true fact. \n\nI am probably coming across as an asshole just for saying that the son is an asshole, but he left, I counted six children: The mum's two kids and four foster kids home alone. The oldest person in the house was 13 and at least one of the kids has high needs which need to be met. That was reckless, unsafe and incredibly selfish. If he had been an adult, there would be no question that doing that was an asshole move. He could have put the younger kids in danger and at 16, he would be old enough to know that. *If* they didn't do this, they *should* have offered him a reward for watching the younger kids, like money or a new game or a day trip out just him and his dad. But that information is not included here. Maybe they did do that, maybe they were going to surprise him with some sort of reward once they got home, if he had actually stayed at home with the younger children, which he didn't.", "His mother died 9 years ago. He has had the same amount of time as the rest of the family. He's been given therapy, time, patience, excuses and the benefit of the doubt. And he endangered his siblings by choice, just to be a problem. He wants to be mad about his mom dying? Okay. Be mad, I guess. Everyone loses their parents at some point. Just look at the other kids in the house! But if he still really thinks only his pain matters, it is time to stop coddling and trusting him, because he is NOT trustworthy. And OP is a snake for calling CPS on a woman who's only crime seems to be wanting to take care of children who need taking care of.", "Then don\u2019t force things in people and then also expect them to have the reaction you want. Some things are out of your control right ?", "No. This isn\u00b4t about mere time or patience. This is that his agency and feelings weren\u00b4t taken into consideration and he had to love his new family when they barged into his life so suddenly and without giving him the resources to cope with the situation from the get-go. And not just that: they\u00b4re forcing him to be a \"big bro\" when it\u00b4s clear as day he\u00b4s not willing. He didn\u00b4t endanger any kid: the parents did and it was THEIR responsibility.", ">He wants to be mad about his mom dying? Okay. Be mad, I guess. Everyone loses their parents at some point.\n\nOddly enough, you gave the BEST argument on why OP is NTA and why the kid acts like he does: his feelings on the matter have been ignored and minimised.", "And one last thing: you failed to answer my questions.", "How on earth are you getting that he's parentified from this post? Redditors learn a word and just decide it fits every situation", "It sure sounds like years of making excuses for his shitty behavior and therapy are not neglecting him. OP is also just an outside observer, not party to the attempts at blending the family. \n\nYour children don\u2019t get to decide how many kids you have. They don\u2019t get to decide where their parents move. They don\u2019t get to decide if their parents divorce. \n\nIt sure sounds like Dad would not have left for work if stepson had not given some indication he would be capable of being person in charge for 40 minutes. Stepson agreed and then disappeared immediately. If Dad can leave work to hunt kid down, he could have stayed if stepson had not consented.", "That\u2019s not good for the other kids. Have any of them, especially the foster kids, said anything about it?", "I literally could not agree more. When forcing one lot of unasked for and unwanted siblings on him didn\u2019t work they thought more and bring those kids into a home filled with tension and strife and then trying to parentify him would! Because forcing him to look after them would fix everything /s. Poor kid.", "So how long do they have to wait for the son so they get to be happy? I have never been in a situation like this so have no reference.", "This.....is just....wow. Yeah, poor kid. \ud83d\ude44\nHow dare his father find a good woman to marry that not only accepts the son but actively wants a good relationship with him. This is very much a narrow-minded, self-centered teenager way to view this situation. The dad could have broken down after that relationship ended, became distant to the point of abandonment,  picked up a drug or alcohol problem, and only came around his son when he wanted to use him. But no, he makes a healthy choice....and everyone is an asshole for it? \nThat kid needs to get out of his own way and quit making his whole personality about how much of a victim he is, how he thinks the world sucks, and how much he thinks he was \"wronged\". \nDear Jesus, you know how many people I knew, including myself, that would have crawled on broken glass to have a CHANCE at having a two parent household? I didn't meet my dad until I was 25. This kid has the golden goose in front of him, and he's kicking the shit out of it.", "There are SEVEN kids in that house. I can\u2019t even imagine. I would lock myself in my room all day, too.", "People hardly ever get any say on whether they have siblings.", "Yeah! Seven just counts bio and adopted kids, they have additional foster kids as well.", "Yup, it\u2019s a recipe for sibling abuse, especially toward the kid with a disability.", "Yeah agreed.", "Nta so her go to solution is to add more kids.", "So the kid, lost his mom, and then went from being just him and Dad, to meeting this strange woman, to 8 months later having a stepmom and two siblings to having four more siblings. I'd also be fucking pissed if I went from being just me and my Dad after my mom died to having a strange woman and six siblings. This honestly seems like a situation where both parents had their heads firmly up their rear-end and is a situation where, \"we can empathize for a while but eventually we expect you to just get over it\". That kid will be gone when he's 18 and never look back. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA your sister keeps saying  needs time and whatever but they have never even tried to give him time, married in less then a year, new step siblings and then strange kids in the house all the time AND THEN even more new adoptive siblings, that poor thing is drowning, he has spend a decade mourning his mom and how his life was before it changed again every 6 months, if she really cares for him she should let it go.", "NTA\n\nPoor child. I have a strong dislike for foster parents who disregard their bio kids in favor of foster kids. It's not right and causes unnecessary drama and stress for everyone involved. He grew up as an only child and then got unwanted siblings. So he's struggling with this blended family and the best solution his step mom comes up with is to...boom... add more children to the mix, even one with a disability. Seems idiotic. It got so bad he needed therapy.\n\nHe doesn't want to be responsible for them and he shouldn't be. He's 16 and he didn't sign up to foster and take care of those kids. Hire a baby sitter. Even if it's only 40 mins. It was wrong of him to leave but they really tried to pigeon hole him and that's not ok.", "NTA - while I admire your sister and her husband for their desire to foster and adopt, their responsibility was to the children they already had before bringing in more.  They have not done right by their oldest.  Bringing more children into a family has never cured family relationships.  \n\nGiving him more responsibility for a family he never wanted in the first place and expecting that to go over in any way differently then it has is just flat out delusional.  \n\nShe can't make him think of her as a parent by forcing it and at this point it is not going to happen.  Agree with others that as soon as he can he will be gone and probably go nc with the whole family", "NTA\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s not even about connecting with stepson anymore. Your sister might have had good intentions in the beginning, but it\u2019s just a power struggle now.", "Question: Why were they bringing in more kids in the house when your sister's stepson was against it? Like what was their reasoning here?", "NTA he\u2019s not one of her kids though.", "NTA.\n\nAND she's going to have husband's bio-son go NC like a sonic boom as soon as he turns 18.", "When people ask you for advice do you just stoically look into the distance and say nothing? Is that what you wanted OP to do?", "It sounds like he just didn\u2019t want his son to be his problem, and so he got married at the first opportunity he. That\u2019s so depressing, can you offer anything to this kid? Give him a space to be away from this family. \n\nAlso leaving him even for 40 minutes with so many children, and you mentioned one with special needs? I can only imagine what other responsibilities they\u2019re forcing on him because there\u2019s no way that your sister and her husband are taking care of all of these young ones without somehow exploiting the eldest. \n\nNope nope nope. Help this kid escape, he needs someone on his side.", "It very much feels like the parents may have a savior complex or fostering children as a way of raising their social standing. I can't imagine why parents would ignore the suffering of their one child in favor of children they don't know very well. Make no mistake, fostering children is a very admirable thing to do, but not when it's causing suffering for your other child.", "No they haven't! They accept his boundaries, accepted he didn't want to be adopted, sent him to therapy, don't ask him to call her Mom or any of that nonsense. They've been great to him. They just don't let him decide what the rest of the family is going to look like. He doesn't want her as a parent, fine. Other kids do. So she and her husband adopted other kids. The 16 year old who is acting like a jerk is the A H here, not the woman STILL holding out hope that he will eventually be a decent person. His father and stepmother (who are his parents, whether he likes it or not) need to find consequences for his actions because he is escalating. If he doesn't want to live there, he's free in 2 years. But he should not be allowed to hurt or endanger the rest of the kids in the family, because he is choosing to remain angry.", "I just imagine all the screaming and hollering that would be going on, and how much I would simply like some quiet.  I bet that is why he locks himself in his room: to just have privacy, solitude, quiet.", "Family planning involves the ENTIRE family, ESPECIALLY in the context of a preteen and bringing in adoptive/foster siblings.\n\nIf you know your kid doesn't want adoptive siblings and you adopt anyways, that shows poor parenting.", "How do you know it didn't work? Therapy doesn't exist to force you to become what other people want.", "NTA. I feel bad for this kid. No one ever listened to him. Also, 13 isn\u2019t too young to be home alone really, especially for just a little bit. I hope the stepson has a good friend group.", "NTA.\n\nNow, sit your sister down and talk to her about parentification, and why in many countries it is considered child abuse!\n\nThey straight up told that kid that he didn't exist as an individual. No wonder he pushed back.\n\nThey messed up, badly, and they will never be able to undo it!", "You are NTA but that young man's Father and your sister are.\n\nWhat an incredibly heart-breaking situation for that young man. He has been let down by the people that were supposed to care about him. He lost his Mother when he was a young boy and since then, everyone has been foisting change upon change instead of letting him grieve properly. And then one day they tell him he has to babysit these smaller people he didn't even want in his life.", "NTA.\n\nThat kid has been communicating his needs and desires pretty clearly for years and years and your sister and her husband are choosing to ignore reality for the fantasy in their head.\n\nHe's going to be gone at 18 and they'll act like they don't know why and they're the victims because they did everything right.", "NTA \u2022\u00a0You are just calling like you see it. No malice intended. The thing that jumps out to me is that this kid, obviously still grieving the mother he lost, unable to accept his father taking on another family, has feelings of abandonment that were probably exacerbated when that new family took on even more kids. That said, he has to be able to see that other children in *his* household are seemingly grateful to have this family that he openly disdains. He is older than the others, and OP mentioned that he has been given 'responsibilities' within this family he didn't want, so maybe he just hides because he doesn't want to be a 'big brother' to anyone. I hope he opens up eventually, but I'm with you. He probably won't, and there isn't much she can do to change that.", "NTA. I feel terrible for that kid. What a fuking circus. I can't imagine trying to grow up around that mess. He's gone once he hits 18 and I don't blame him.", "therapists can\u2019t make you love people lol", "Is there a way to let the kid know that if he needs someone, you're there? Or something akin to that? The poor dude has NO support system and absolutely no one is listening to him.", "Actually, I think the only person that wasn\u2019t good for his stepson. They took in a lot of children that didn\u2019t have families and they seem to be doing just fine. So the only person that didn\u2019t benefit from it is the step kid. And it seems from the beginning he didn\u2019t want it anyway like there was gonna be no way of pleasing him.\n\nin a family there\u2019s one that seems a little maladjusted the whole family, especially large one cannot been to one person that doesn\u2019t seem to want to work with it at all. It\u2019s just destroys everything.   I guess they could\u2019ve just kept him in the sisters, but didn\u2019t like it then either.", "Lol, no. It\u2019s totally normal to not want siblings and it\u2019s totally normal for parents to ignore that."]}
