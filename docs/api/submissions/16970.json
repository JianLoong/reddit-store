Her kids were 4 and 2 when they met and her husband's son was 7. They married after 8 months of being together. Her stepson did not accept my sister or her kids well. My sister told me and our parents her family was going through \"some growing pains\" and that her stepson might have an attitude for a while but to please make him feel welcomed and loved. A couple of years after they got married my sister and her husband became foster parents. My sister's husband adopted her older kids. Her stepson didn't want to be adopted and showed a lot of anger about bringing more kids into the house. Things were messy. Her stepson was acting out a lot and was finding a lot of excuses not to be home. She would say things like \"he just needs time\" or \"oh you know how boys can be\". She and her husband put him in therapy when it got so bad he was staying in his room all the time and locking the door. Honestly, my parents and I were concerned about the suitability for them to have vulnerable foster kids added into the mix and we spoke to the case worker but they were still considered better than nobody.\n\nThey ended up adopting from foster care three times. Two bio siblings, a little girl with special needs and a boy who was only a baby. They continued fostering alongside the adoptions.\n\nMy sister's stepson is now 16. My sister and her husband have tried to give him more responsibilities within the family and have tried to get him to spend time with all the additional siblings, for a chance to bond. A few weeks ago he was asked to stay home with the kids for 40 minutes while his dad went to work, that my sister would be home then. He left once his dad was out of sight and my sister got home to the other kids, who are 13 and under, home alone. My sister was so upset and called her husband. He ended up taking the day off work and he found his son and dragged him home. They argued and my sister was trying to talk to him, hoping he would say why. He either ignores her or says he doesn't have to tell her anything, that she's not his mother or his parent or his family. It's been weeks of this. My sister is still upset. CPS was made aware of what happened by one of the foster kids and nothing was done, they said it could happen in any family. \n\nMy sister has been very upset about her stepson's unwillingness to discuss things with her. She told me she has tried multiple times to get him to open up to her and he just won't and how it's stressing her the fuck out. I let her talk a few times, I offered her comfort. But now it has become a fixation and I can't help but notice it's distracting her from the other kids. So the last time she brought it up I told her she needs to give in and accept her stepson isn't going to talk to her and that she needs to leave that to her husband. She told me he's one of her kids and she can't just leave it or accept it.

I can see him cutting them off once he is 18.", "That kid is gonna be outa there at eighteen and she will still hope he will, one day, want to be part of the blended and adopted family. NTA", "NTA, but I have to wonder why the hell they ever thought an 8 month relationship was enough for the kid to adjust in the first place.", "Your sister has two bio kids, her husband one.\n\nThey're a blended family with three kids which isn't functioning well as your husband's son has difficulties accepting the new family situation.\n\nThen Your Sis and BIL throw in a couple of foster kids, of which they adopt some, and then they continue to add on the kids count with other foster children.\n\nSil and BIL seem lovely people, wanting to care for so many children, but they should have waited to form a solid base. The whole family needs to be on board when fostering and adopting. With each kid Sis and BIL added to the mix, they lost BIL's kid a little more...\n\nNTA for telling Sis it's too late...", "NTA - 9 years of living in this situation should have lended your sister to some form of acceptance or knowledge here.   \n\nThe kid is mad as hell. His dad remarried before he was even done grieving, his new life involves a whole mess of kids and I am sure his dad is split time-wise and cant give the 16-year-old full attention. And then you add MORE KIDS.  \n\nChildren in very stable loving homes without death or remarriage act like this when foster kids or adopted kids are added in. It is a normal reaction.  \n\nthe 16 year olds reaction to your sister is also fairly normal.  \n\nWhat you said to your sister is just fine. A little- hey you have to understand and have empathy. You see him as YOUR kid but he sees you as Betty who happens to be around and he has to tolerate. It is very different.", "NTA\n\nWhat the stepson did with the foster kids was unacceptable but he's not one of the people we're judging here. The conflict as presented is between you and your sister; and frankly, the situation with the stepson and the foster kids would never have happened if your sister and her husband had behaved remotely responsibly as parents from the beginning.\n\nIt sounds like neither one of them has EVER, EVER prioritised this boy from the start. While his father absolutely had the right to date and remarry after being widowed, standard advice is not to even introduce a child to a new romantic interest until you've been with them for at least six months (to ensure that the relationship is a serious and stable one), and then to do so slowly and thoughtfully, so as to give the child time to get comfortable with having this new adult in their life in the fraught emotional situation where their family dynamic is changing significantly. \n\nThey did everything in the worst possible way, bringing not only your sister but her children into this little boy's life much too quickly, upending his whole world with a marriage, major household changes (and with them obviously changes in routine, privacy, time with his dad, etc.). And then within only a couple of years they filled the house with not only MORE children, but children who likely had intense emotional needs, meaning that his life was made even more chaotic and he became less and less of a priority. And your sister tried to justify this by saying that they then dumped some of the responsibility for those kids on him?!! \n\nAt every step along the way they have deprioritised this kid's needs, his emotional well-being, and his best interests. My heart breaks for him. And you are absolutely NTA.", ">Her stepson was acting out a lot and was finding a lot of excuses not to be home.\n\nOkay? Acting out how? Not wanting to be in the house is not a big deal. Locking himself in his room isn't that strange for a teenager. \n\n>Two bio siblings, a little girl with special needs and a boy who was only a baby. They continued fostering alongside the adoptions.\n\nIf I was this kid, I would have run away. How on earth are they getting this many kids? \n\n>have tried to get him to spend time with all the additional siblings, for a chance to bond.\n\nWhat. What are they doing? Leave the kid alone. He clearly wants nothing to do with any of this. They tried to make him stay home with six other kids. Of course he left. This kid probably hates both of them at this point.", "NTA. It's been 9 years... he isn't going to change his mind. If he manages to not take off before 18 he will the minute he graduates and hits that 18th bday. Also, forcing him to watch step siblings he has no interest in will not help them bond.", "Nta sis *and dad* need to accept reality.  Per OPs comments, the 16yo didn't agree to babysit. The kids were dumped on him by his dad.  Dad is at fault here.\n\nThey both know the 16yo doesn't consider any of them family.   Why are they so shocked that he left?\n\nThey choose to foster and adopt. That's means they're responsible.  What would dad have done is 16yo wasn't home?  That's what he should have done.", "NTA - your sister came to you with complaints and was looking for advice, though you were blunt, at this point it sounds like you might be right", "NTA - your sisters persistence in the mom/son relationship is only driving a bigger wedge. I lost my mom young and my dad dated a series of women over the years till he died. Not a single single one of them ever felt like mom. At 7 he was old enough to know that mom/son bond and no woman is ever gonna take that place. Your sister sounds like a good woman but she needs to acknowledge that she will never be his mom and she needs to tell him that and say it to him and that might heal the rift and allow a meaningful relationship to form.", "NTA the more she pushes the more he's going to go no contact when he's 18.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a hot mess, OP, as is her husband. This poor kid lost his mom, then had the traumatic experience of having a stepmother and stepsiblings forced on him after your sister had only been dating his father for a short time. What SHOULD have happened was lots of therapy for him and the entire family. I'm guessing that didn't happen.\n\nInstead of focusing on the three kids they did have, one of whom was in serious pain and distress, your sister and BIL decided to adopt a bunch more kids from foster care, kids they clearly are not able to handle parenting if they are dumping the responsibility for caring for them on the now 16-year-old child. \n\nHe should not be forced to babysit. He should be given therapy, attention from his dad if it's not too late to fix all the ways he and your sister have screwed up his childhood, and they need to stop parentificating him. So yeah, I'd say all that to her.", "NTA. What else can you say to her after all of this?", "The stepson *abandoned vulnerable kids after agreeing to watch them* and got CPS called on them, purely to spite her. Telling her to \"give in\" to that sort of behavior isn't acceptable. YTA here, and the husband and kid seem to suck as well; your sister seems to be the only sane one here.", "That's a normal conversation, not a conflict.\n\nI don't consider your \"advice\" particularly helpful, and I doubt you really thought she would be receptive to it considering her history with this child.  If you are tired of listening to her vent about it, then deal with that a different way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One of the children she KNEW was in a very bad place emotionally. There was no \"extra\" room in that house for more children.
