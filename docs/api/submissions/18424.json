I'm not someone who can be left to his own thoughts very well, and I need people around me, I thrive on energy and excitement.\n\nMy wife is a bit of the opposite. She's generally fine with being left alone and can sit quietly for hours and hours upon end.\n\nThe problem is that around 11:00 p.m., I was driving and my wife and our son were in the backseat. I was feeling isolated, so I shook her awake, but then our son woke up, and well, you can probably guess what happens next.\n\nOnce he quieted down, my wife began to quietly blow up at me, about how much of a dick I was being. I told her that it wasn't fair for her to just sleep like that, and it made me feel like a driver. She then said that she doesn't force me to stay awake or engange with her, but I told her that that's a cheap blow because we're not the same people, and I kept my mouth shut while she was driving because I know she doesn't like distractions even though it bothered me terribly, so the least she could do is to stop being selfish and help keep me sane.\n\nDespite my perfectly logical answer, she apparently got emotional, and then started whisper screaming some shit about how raising one toddler is hard enough, and that she didn't know there was another one in the car who needed his whims catered to at every moment, and at that point, since she got rude, I decided to disengange. Now our whole trip is falling apart and she's making me out to be the bad guy.", "created_utc": 1685326791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ui6tg/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_stay_up_during_a_road/", "score": 656, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not someone who can be left to his own thoughts very well, and I need people around me, I thrive on energy and excitement.\n\nMy wife is a bit of the opposite. She's generally fine with being left alone and can sit quietly for hours and hours upon end.\n\nThe problem is that around 11:00 p.m., I was driving and my wife and our son were in the backseat. I was feeling isolated, so I shook her awake, but then our son woke up, and well, you can probably guess what happens next.\n\nOnce he quieted down, my wife began to quietly blow up at me, about how much of a dick I was being. I told her that it wasn't fair for her to just sleep like that, and it made me feel like a driver. She then said that she doesn't force me to stay awake or engange with her, but I told her that that's a cheap blow because we're not the same people, and I kept my mouth shut while she was driving because I know she doesn't like distractions even though it bothered me terribly, so the least she could do is to stop being selfish and help keep me sane.\n\nDespite my perfectly logical answer, she apparently got emotional, and then started whisper screaming some shit about how raising one toddler is hard enough, and that she didn't know there was another one in the car who needed his whims catered to at every moment, and at that point, since she got rude, I decided to disengange. Now our whole trip is falling apart and she's making me out to be the bad guy.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
