I'm not someone who can be left to his own thoughts very well, and I need people around me, I thrive on energy and excitement.\n\nMy wife is a bit of the opposite. She's generally fine with being left alone and can sit quietly for hours and hours upon end.\n\nThe problem is that around 11:00 p.m., I was driving and my wife and our son were in the backseat. I was feeling isolated, so I shook her awake, but then our son woke up, and well, you can probably guess what happens next.\n\nOnce he quieted down, my wife began to quietly blow up at me, about how much of a dick I was being. I told her that it wasn't fair for her to just sleep like that, and it made me feel like a driver. She then said that she doesn't force me to stay awake or engange with her, but I told her that that's a cheap blow because we're not the same people, and I kept my mouth shut while she was driving because I know she doesn't like distractions even though it bothered me terribly, so the least she could do is to stop being selfish and help keep me sane.\n\nDespite my perfectly logical answer, she apparently got emotional, and then started whisper screaming some shit about how raising one toddler is hard enough, and that she didn't know there was another one in the car who needed his whims catered to at every moment, and at that point, since she got rude, I decided to disengange. Now our whole trip is falling apart and she's making me out to be the bad guy.", "created_utc": 1685326791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ui6tg/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_stay_up_during_a_road/", "score": 7854, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not someone who can be left to his own thoughts very well, and I need people around me, I thrive on energy and excitement.\n\nMy wife is a bit of the opposite. She's generally fine with being left alone and can sit quietly for hours and hours upon end.\n\nThe problem is that around 11:00 p.m., I was driving and my wife and our son were in the backseat. I was feeling isolated, so I shook her awake, but then our son woke up, and well, you can probably guess what happens next.\n\nOnce he quieted down, my wife began to quietly blow up at me, about how much of a dick I was being. I told her that it wasn't fair for her to just sleep like that, and it made me feel like a driver. She then said that she doesn't force me to stay awake or engange with her, but I told her that that's a cheap blow because we're not the same people, and I kept my mouth shut while she was driving because I know she doesn't like distractions even though it bothered me terribly, so the least she could do is to stop being selfish and help keep me sane.\n\nDespite my perfectly logical answer, she apparently got emotional, and then started whisper screaming some shit about how raising one toddler is hard enough, and that she didn't know there was another one in the car who needed his whims catered to at every moment, and at that point, since she got rude, I decided to disengange. Now our whole trip is falling apart and she's making me out to be the bad guy.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My husband and I have done several coast-to-coast drives across the US, and the only time we planned driving days longer than about 6 hours was the time we did the drive *before* we had kids. Once we had kids, we started planning pretty carefully to allow big breaks during the drive time and for always stopping for the day after about 5-6.5 hours of drive time.

In theory, stopping somewhere half way through to sleep makes sense.

It also means more stops, which means more $ on road-trip food and snacks, and you have to pay for an extra night in a hotel on the way to and from your destination. \n\nWe have done it both ways, and we finally figured out a system that works for us. We pack and load up the car the day before, everyone gets to bed early, and then we get up at 2am and get on the road. Typically the kids will fall back asleep quickly and sleep till 8 or 9. By then the driving adult is ready to stop for breakfast/break, and then the other adult takes over driving. We usually get to our destination in early evening and have time to unpack and relax. \nSplitting into two days is just too much, but so is driving it all in one day if you start at normal time.", "The mainland US is pretty large, and families can be spread out across multiple states. Needing to travel distances of well over 1000km to reach close family isn't entirely uncommon, and if flying would be too expensive for somebody then chances are that they can't afford the added costs that staying in a motel would bring, which also includes having to take additional time off of work due to the trip taking longer because you're stopping to sleep.\n\nNow, trying to do this with a two year old in tow seems like a terrible idea if this was just a vacation.
