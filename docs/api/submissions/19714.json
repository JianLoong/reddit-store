If someone insulted my house I would ask them to leave on the spot.", "NTA. Your MIL needs to be put in her place when it comes to respecting you and your home. I wouldn't let her paint the nursery, it's your home not hers.  \nYou need to try to be honest with everything that's bothering you first to see how she reacts or if she even cares. If that doesn't work then you need to have a serious conversation with your husband about this.... just because she's his mom doesn't mean she gets a free pass to talk to you any way she sees fit. She's being disrespectful.", "Can you and your husband set a boundary that any put-downs from a family member or guest in your home will result in no more invitations?", "NTA!! But you should speak to your husband so he knows where you are coming from and that this is not something you can just ignore. If you don\u2019t want her in your house you shouldn\u2019t have to have her in it. He should speak with his mother and sort it out with her so you can feel at ease at your own house.", "NTA. Tell her she\u2019s not welcome in your hole any longer, as it\u2019s not a good place for a child and she needs to grow up.", "NTA. Your MIL is. You owe her nothing!", "So she also lives in a hole in the same area lol", "I hate painting, so I\u2019d let her do it and conveniently schedule a day of errands when she\u2019s planning on coming. Kill her with kindness - agree with her that it\u2019s an absolute pit -  and then ask her when she\u2019s planning on painting the kitchen/replacing the appliances/putting in landscaping - whatever else you need done, since the house is so unlivable.  NTA", "You should tell her all of that and just how hurtful it was to you she clearly is going to be involved which is a great thing! (Hopefully) but you should tell her to apologize and your husband should support you in this 100%", "NTA, however, do you think you're comfortable talking to your MIL about why her words were hurtful and give her the chance to apologize? Or explaining it to your husband and asking him to prompt her to seek you out to apologize? \n\nYou're not obligated to accept her apology, nor are you obligated to seek her out for one...that's totally up to you whether or not a relationship with her is worth it. Whatever you decide, she was the one in the wrong for criticizing your home.", "NTA if you don\u2019t speak up and put her in her place then she is going to walk all over you forever. She will constantly criticize your parenting.", "Toxic mother in law. My paternal grandma  was like that, always criticising my mother. Calling someone home \" a hole\" is pretty rude.", "NTA. But no need to blow it up by banning her from your house haha. \n\nI've had similar types of problems with my mother in law (I'm the husband) about bringing stress to my wife. I don't think it was malicious, just thoughtless. After a couple calm conversations she is much more aware of the affect negative comments can make on my wife's stress level.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is the love and gratitude inside it. The wholeness and belonging. \n\nMIL doesn't see that, and in fact detracts from that?

Home is where you feel happy and safe.  When other people criticize your furniture, your yard, etc.  Tell them to go home.\n\nI have In-laws like this.  Hubby and I are happy and warm in our home and we have zero debt.  So... yea they criticize and then have stress about other things (I am guessing $$).  I don't talk to them that much.\n\nI feel bad for hubby bc he is in a spot between our home (and my family) where everything is accepted and wanted... and his where appearances matter more than solidity.", "Nta. Ask her why she wants to hang out in or paint a hole. Paint a nursery that is bad for the baby.", "NTA but it\u2019s also his mother I doubt that\u2019s gonna fly, over a one off remark. you disliked her comment so why not speak to her about how and why those kinds of comments hurt your feelings and how you\u2019d appreciate if she would be more careful in the way she speaks to you in your own home.\n\nIf you do that and she still feels she has the right to be that way then all bets are off and you did what you could to be the more mature one.", "Great answer. NTA and do not let her paint the nursery. Your house, your baby!"]}
