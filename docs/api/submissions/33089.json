My stepdad has one daughter, 'Tia' [f30s].\n\nTia is married and has 9 kids with her husband. They also have over 7 cats. They live in a 4 bedroom house but as you can imagine it's still pretty cramped.\n\nI haven't spent loads of time with Tia, as she was already an adult when our parents got married. My mom and the rest of my immediate bio family really dislike Tia and her husband.\n\nI've visited Tia's home quite a few times over the years and it's always looked an absolute mess. The house always stinks of cat piss and you can't even see the floor where there's just stuff everywhere. The kids themselves don't seem neglected before anyone asks, they always look clean, it's just the actual house. Tia's husband is also always working on DIY home projects that never get finished which also just adds to the clutter and shit everywhere...\n\nIn my family we normally rotate around who's hosting the Christmas get-together. Tia last hosted it in 2019. It caused an argument between my mom and stepdad behind closed doors because my mom said if Tia hosts again, she will not be going.\n\nAs usual, the house was a mess. Tia's husband served everyone including all the kids of the family seriously undercooked chicken (it was still cold in the middle). My mom pointed this out and they threw it in the trash, luckily no one had eaten it. They had no gifts for anyone, not even my stepdad who spent over $600 on their kids. I know gifts aren't absolutely necessary but this just felt a bit rude... They then unexpectedly asked everyone to leave after we had been there for 2 hours as Tia's mom and maternal grandparents were coming over.\n\nThis year, Tia has volunteered to host again and invited us. My mom does not want to go and said we should just stay home this Christmas. This time my stepdad actually agreed so we're gonna stay home. My older bio siblings also do not want to visit Tia again for Christmas and all told her they aren't going and said they have other plans.\n\nTia was pleasant about it over text but on Facebook she made passive aggressive posts about how her fake family doesn't want to visit her on Christmas.\n\nI may be an asshole because I was growing tired of seeing these posts. I ran into Tia last week at the store and she mentioned it to me, saying that she's hurt by everyone not visiting. I told her very bluntly we aren't visiting her because no one wants her to host she and her husband happily accepted gifts from everyone but got nothing for anyone, tried to feed us raw chicken and their house is a mess. Tia and I started arguing, and she said that we should've communicated to her like adults rather than just not visit her but I feel like some things are just common sense.\n\nSorry this is so long, AITA?", "created_utc": 1702673988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ja4kp/aita_for_telling_my_stepsister_no_one_wants_her/", "score": 1186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't tell me the kids are living in that filth and they are not labelled 'the smelly kids' in their classes. Usually the teachers all know them, and somehow tactfully find a way to reach out to the parents. Like offering to donate clothes and bookbags, or asking if their water is turned off or something. \n\nIf the kids continue to come to school smelling like cat pee, without actually having it ON them, then requests to cps to make a home visit start. \n\nYou got out lucky, being kicked out after two hours, YOU could have been the next 'smelly kid'.", "Sometimes people with animals become nose blind to odors.", "NTA", "People don\u2019t know what sick is until they have had salmonella poisoning. The closest I would get to that house is a Christmas card.

The audacity of saying \u201ccommunicate like an adult\u201d, maybe she should host like an adult.", "And add in some litter deodorizer and pet stain remover!", "I thought I was the only one who found this absolutely insane.", "Between 3 bedrooms too (if the parents have their own which I'm very sure they would)", "The adults should have said something to Tia four years ago when OP was still a kid and ha no reasonable expectation to", "I\u2019d argue she\u2019s the more childish one by going on social media to bitch and complain about her fanily", "NTA", "If Catpiss Neverclean's house is that bad, I'd volunteer to leave.", "Yo, what about the cat piss smell???! \ud83e\udd22 \n\nNTA. In all seriousness, who would actually initiate that conversation? Honestly, OP showed some real ovaries being more honest and direct than anyone else\u2014including Tia\u2019s bio dad\u2014was willing to.", "I seriously cannot imagine going to someones house for Christmas for only two hours. What a waste of gas! \n\nMy boyfriends mom hosts Christmas every year, and we are always there for at LEAST 5-7 hours.", "People who like chicken more than other things?", "People who don\u2019t like eating turkey, or people who are on a stricter budget?", "My aunt and uncle did a ham when they hosted Christmas but ham makes me sick so they got me fried chicken from the grocery store. Don't knock it til you try it, stuff was good.", "Of course, that's why I used \"no one said a word\", not \"OP didn't saya word\".", "I don't know why anyone is saying not getting people gifts is part of the dealbreaker. Literally everything else is a perfectly decent reason to not go but if someone has 9 kids I'm straight up telling them not to get anyone anything. When my extended family stopped doing gifts it stopped year after year of petty complaints. Also, in my family the host usually doesn't give gifts because hosting is a lot and isn't cheap. I'm also kind if put off that OP says her mom doesn't like the stepdaughter and instead of giving \"she doesn't tip\" or something telling me she's an awful person, all I got was that her family has judged her for years without giving her feedback, she has no self-awareness and a hoarding issue of the living and inanimate sort, they need to learn to buy pre-cooked food because trying to cook is not their thing, and she vented about it on social media. I'm usually even judgmental about the last part but if everyone vented about her behind her back and told her something else it's not like she was just making things up for likes; they're mad because they got called out Everyone here sucks, except maybe the cats, they're just doing what they do. If this were my family I wouldn't host or go to any of their houses because they all sound like they hate each other.", "This is where I'm at. I don't want gifts from someone who has 9 kids, her stepmom doesn't like her but we don't know if she's ever had the spine to tell anyone but her child or husband that, and they don't give us really an indication of her character other than putting the family on blast on social media, which is cringeworthy, but also the truth. The rest is pathological, like hoarding pets and kids and stuff, and it sounds like they at least try instead of making huge demands of everyone. I'm not a fan of the OP even if they come back with more context than \"ew, dirty house, we don't like this stepsister.\"", "That too", "I mean, I have kids, dogs, MY house is far from \"sterile\" on a daily basis. BUT if I'm hosting and cooking for people I CLEAN LIKE CHEEZUS HAROLD CHRISTMAS HIMSELF is coming to dinner. That completely skeeves me out, cooking in a filth pit and expecting people to eat filth pit food. Even if my house is chaos and it's just my husband and the kids I HAVE to clean the kitchen down before I cook. Maybe it's the years of restaurant management or growing up in abject clutter, but..... yuck. Just yuck. Remember that episode of Seinfeld where Kramer started cooking in his shower??? Had a garbage disposal installed in the drain and everything. He made a salad and everyone was saying how good it was and a soon as they found out it was a shower salad they spit it out and started gagging.

Masks strongly recommended.", "Suggestion--\"By three, it's out you'll head so Mom can come instead\"--that way, you have tbe rhyme in the middle.", "You nailed it. And plenty of off-the-record support. \u201cI\u2019m so glad someone said something. \u201c\n\nYeah well, maybe it would have stuck if some of you had backed me when you were consulted instead of telling them what they wanted to hear.\n\nBut honestly, probably not.\n\nFTR\u2014 this was someone with hygiene discipline so bad that you could smell it feet away. This person was a hard worker who repeatedly expressed mystification and frustration that they kept getting passed over for promotion by less diligent workers. This is why it felt worth saying. Completely paid the price listed above, changes lasted about half a year, I was the asshole for about a year. It\u2019s all in the rear view mirror now, odor has returned, mystification continues. \n\nBut hey\u2014 at least I learned something.", "Yeah that\u2019s all well and good. Clutter I can understand, but if your home smells of cat piss, you are seriously lacking hygiene and the cats probably don\u2019t even have clean litter to use. They shouldn\u2019t have so many cats if they can\u2019t provide a clean space for them. And they shouldn\u2019t be subjecting their children to living like that whether they\u2019re outwardly clean or not.

You have to understand, with all the kids and  cats I\u2019m just too busy cooking it all the way through\u201d\n\nYeah right lol conveniently forgetting half the reasons OP gave.

Do you normally cut off family members for messing up one meal?\n\nDoes OP\u2019s step dad even want gifts? Op decided that was wrong on his behalf, not because he said anything. Plenty of adults simply don\u2019t want gifts besides quality time because they can buy what they want themselves. \n\nThe whole thing can be read much more kindly, especially since OP admits that she and bio family simply dislike stepsis and are seemingly happy to exclude her.", "Some people are shitty cooks. It\u2019s not a crime.", "Well Tia had to finish cooking the chicken right\ud83d\ude02.", "Or blended family.", "Yeah, I mean, she's been pregnant, or recovering from childirth for a large chunk of her adult life here. And having all the babies and kids to take care of during all that too. OP didn't specify, but I kinda hope they're not all her bio kids.", "That probably also depends on where the litter boxes are. I\u2019ve had cats all my life and I also have a very similar sense of smell. Because of this we give them their own room so the scent is contained, and also clean the house itself regularly. I\u2019ve been in other people\u2019s houses who have cats with the litter box in a public room and the house usually has that pee smell."]}
