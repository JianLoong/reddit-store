My friend is a man who is 5\u20196 so needless to say he has issues regarding his height. The rest of us groomsmen range from 5\u20197 to 6\u20192. So we are all as tall if not taller than him. He has less of an issue with this but he did have issues with the height of the bridal party.\n\nMy girlfriend is a taller gal at 5\u20198 and the rest of them are between his and her height.\nDuring his wedding, he decided he wanted to look a bit taller, so he bought shoe insoles that made him 2 inches taller. This was partially driven by the desire to not be the shorter than any women up in front. \n\nHe also wanted for none of the bridesmaids to be in heels.  He wanted them all in flats as that would keep them all shorter than him. His wife didn\u2019t necessarily agree with this so she didn\u2019t make it a requirement in their outfits to wear flats, so he tasked the groomsmen with talking to the ladies and getting them to wear flats. \n\nAll of them agreed, EXCEPT my girlfriend. She said she picked out heels to wear just for this day and she was gonna wear them. I tried to point out that there will be other chances but this guy only has one wedding and the nice thing to do is to just appease him. She said that she listens to the bride and she the bride says she can wear heels so she will.\n\nI tried my best to convince her to just wear some flats but she wouldn\u2019t listen. Eventually it got too close to the day and while my gf was practicing and one of the heels mysteriously broke and it was too close to the day to get an exact replacement so she was stuck in flats.\n\nSo as you may have guessed, It was me. And I know it was fucked up, but I\u2019ll pay to replace it for her. She didn\u2019t find out until I told her after the wedding and she of course was not happy. She said I was policing her outfit for my insecure friend and that she wanted to look good that day.\n\nI don\u2019t think I did anything wrong as I stopped her from ruining his wedding for him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674762125, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m0i1x/aita_for_purposefully_breaking_my_girlfriends/", "score": 440, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend needs to get over being threatened by tall women and his insecurity complex. And not only that, you're coddling him and essentially telling your girlfriend that the bride is less important than the groom. Bride clearly thinks her husband's insecurities are ridiculous too if she doesn't care what they wear.

His wife was against it. He went around her (no shame) and all of you guys agreed, instead of telling him he was nuts and this was unnecessary (no shame). Then almost all of his wife\u2019s bridesmaids decided to go behind her back (no shame). Your gf was the only stand up person in the bunch so you did the cowardly thing and broke your gf\u2019s heels in secret (no shame lmfao, cmon man), in a way that endangered her health for the benefit of hiding your hand in it.

There are plenty of shorter men who do not have issues regarding their height. If one bridesmaid in heels would have ruined his wedding, he's got some f'ed up priorities. \n\nSeriously, you guys have to get over your hang-ups about your height. Get therapy, something, anything.

Why did you decide to break her shoes instead of maybe hiding them since you felt so strongly about her not wearing them? The bride didn\u2019t want her bridesmaids to change shoes, they only changed shoes because the groom got his groomsmen to ask the bridesmaids to change to flats.

So congrats on catering to your friend's fragile ego and destroying your relationship in the process. If my boyfriend destroyed my things, especially for someone else, that's an ex boyfriend. Seriously. I wouldn't want to deal with the scenarios of 'if he did this because his friend's pride is so damn fragile, what else will he do to cater to this friend? Lie to me? Destroy other things?

My friend is a man who is 5\u20196 so needless to say he has issues regarding his height. The rest of us groomsmen range from 5\u20197 to 6\u20192. So we are all as tall if not taller than him. He has less of an issue with this but he did have issues with the height of the bridal party.\n\nMy girlfriend is a taller gal at 5\u20198 and the rest of them are between his and her height.\nDuring his wedding, he decided he wanted to look a bit taller, so he bought shoe insoles that made him 2 inches taller. This was partially driven by the desire to not be the shorter than any women up in front. \n\nHe also wanted for none of the bridesmaids to be in heels.  He wanted them all in flats as that would keep them all shorter than him. His wife didn\u2019t necessarily agree with this so she didn\u2019t make it a requirement in their outfits to wear flats, so he tasked the groomsmen with talking to the ladies and getting them to wear flats. \n\nAll of them agreed, EXCEPT my girlfriend. She said she picked out heels to wear just for this day and she was gonna wear them. I tried to point out that there will be other chances but this guy only has one wedding and the nice thing to do is to just appease him. She said that she listens to the bride and she the bride says she can wear heels so she will.\n\nI tried my best to convince her to just wear some flats but she wouldn\u2019t listen. Eventually it got too close to the day and while my gf was practicing and one of the heels mysteriously broke and it was too close to the day to get an exact replacement so she was stuck in flats.\n\nSo as you may have guessed, It was me. And I know it was fucked up, but I\u2019ll pay to replace it for her. She didn\u2019t find out until I told her after the wedding and she of course was not happy. She said I was policing her outfit for my insecure friend and that she wanted to look good that day.\n\nI don\u2019t think I did anything wrong as I stopped her from ruining his wedding for him.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The fact that the bride and groom wanted to carry out two different instructions to the bridal party is insane. The fact that you broke your girlfriend's shoes is insane. Why not tell him to work this out with his wife, since they gave these women conflicting instructions?\n\nI'll admit she's a little bit of the asshole for not just wearing flats when she knew it was important to the groom, but she's the smallest asshole here.", "Yikes, ESH. Really this was between your friend and his now-wife. He definitely shouldn't have roped you guys into doing his bidding (behind his wife's back no less). His wife should have supported her husband's request, Your girlfriend should have gone along with a benign request that is obviously a sore spot, and you shouldn't have broken your girlfriend's shoe.", "YTA. Anyone that has to practice in heels for a wedding won't be in heels for long. The situation would have probably taken care of itself in time.\n\nThe request should have been made directly and involved the bride, those were her attendants after all.", "~~YTA and so is the Groom.~~\n\nYou were indeed policing her outfit for your insecure friend lol. I mean, look, I get it -- it's their wedding and he wanted it to go a certain way. And you wanted to be there for your friend. But her being taller than him in a couple of photos would not have ruined his wedding day -- his insecurity is what would've ruined his day. She has a right to be upset that you broker her property.\n\nAnd TBH, he didn't do himself any favors anyway. It's unusual for bridesmaids to wear flats at weddings -- I guarantee you people realized why the girls were in flats rather than heels. And that is more embarrassing for him than if he had just had the confidence to be slightly shorter than some of the women.\n\nEDIT: changing my answer to ESH. I still think you and groom are annoying but I also think your girlfriend could have just complied for the sake of someone else's wedding. She would probably want the same. However, I still think breaking her shoes was too far.", "ESH and all of you sound absolutely exhausting. Ugh.", "YTA. Jesus Christ.", "I don't see how this is any different than a bridesmaid spilling wine on someone because of the bride's wishes. \n\nHowever, ESH. You destroying something that wasn't yours.

Groom for thinking 5'8 is short.", "YTA for destroying something she'd carefully chosen for this event but also for enabling your friend.

It's selfish. \n\nYou for taking it upon yourself to break her things. If your girl wants to make an ass out of herself, she should have been allowed to fall onto her face doing so.

You suck for breaking your girlfriend\u2019s shoes, your girlfriend sucks for wearing heels when she knows it would upset the groom, the bride sucks for not honoring the groom\u2019s request when it was important to him, the groom sucks for letting his insecurities have him make a silly request of his wedding party", "ESH. Other people have already covered why.\n\nI'm a 5'3\" guy and because my wife wore heels I was the shortest person in my entire wedding party, men and women.

With that being said she should have been kind and not worn the heels. It is not her wedding and she can \u201clook good\u201d without wearing heels. I also feel the bride should have stuck up for her husband. We all have insecurities and if he brought this up to her and was really bothered by it she should have addressed his feelings instead of ignoring them. That to me seems like an immature move on the brides part, prioritizing her bridesmaid\u2019s feelings over her future husband\u2019s feelings especially on his and her\u2019s wedding day. Everyone wants to feel their best on their wedding day and everyone wants to be the center of attention so i personally understand his frustration.

Same as it would be to shame a man about his height."]}
