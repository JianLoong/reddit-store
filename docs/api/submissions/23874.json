There is no scenario in which your other daughter and her family are going to be invited to this vacation, and we will be devastated if you attempt anything to the contrary. This is the decision, and what we have decided is right for our family for this trip. This is not a trip for your family, this is a trip for the family I have created with my husband.\"\n\nIt sounds like she's having some trouble understanding that this is not \"her\" family trip, for whatever reason, but your nuclear family's trip to which she has been invited.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Can you explain why there is a seeming double standard here?\n\nEven without that issue, my kid's will really value the grandma time and it's just a lot simpler and less stressful managing one family's needs and routines rather than trying to compromise across two families. One example is that their bed time routine and schedule isn't aligned well with ours. This will put pressure on you and them to leave earlier than us and so we'd miss out on some of the things we hoped to include you in. So, while it's a fun idea to go on a family trip, I think it will just cause conflict if we try to balance everyone's needs in this trip. Maybe a summer weekend at a lake nearby would be a better way of getting the family together in a less stressful environment.\"", "Happy cake day! \ud83c\udf82"]}
