Can you explain why there is a seeming double standard here?\n\nEven without that issue, my kid's will really value the grandma time and it's just a lot simpler and less stressful managing one family's needs and routines rather than trying to compromise across two families. One example is that their bed time routine and schedule isn't aligned well with ours. This will put pressure on you and them to leave earlier than us and so we'd miss out on some of the things we hoped to include you in. So, while it's a fun idea to go on a family trip, I think it will just cause conflict if we try to balance everyone's needs in this trip. Maybe a summer weekend at a lake nearby would be a better way of getting the family together in a less stressful environment.\"", "Happy cake day! \ud83c\udf82", "INFO: did you ask your mother what the difference is between your sister\u2019s trip and yours?", "NTA.

We shared a room as well, and she complained about everything, the entire time we were there.

Also would be seriously uncomfortable.", "I wish I had asked you, lol!", "Thanks for clarifying!", "my guess is if they are doing Disney World - they may be doing one of the family suites (like Art of Animation) or have DVC and have a 2 bedroom villa which can fit that many. \n\nThey maybe also doing an AirBNB or another off-property accommodation."]}
