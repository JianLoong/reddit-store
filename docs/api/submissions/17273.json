She waited for 10 minutes. Big deal", "NTA, how were you supposed to know the flight would land 15 mins before its original time, and 25 earlier than the notification said - everyone who keeps saying flight tracker apps, those obviously don't work every time. I was picking up a friend and I refreshed the page a dozen times and she still arrived 20 mins before the time it said. Also, what did she want you to do if you had shown up too early? It's not like you can just park outside in the loading zone for 10 mins, and not every airport has a waiting lot, and even then you'd have to drive from that lot which, oh god, will make her wait a whole 5 mins more. She's being a brat.", "Nta.  If you didn't know she was landing early how could you know?", "NTA. If my spouse lost it over 10 minutes, they would be taking Ubers home for the rest of eternity.", ">However, she felt disrespected \n\nDiswespected over a ten minute wait?  That would have gotten an \"eff your entitled arse\" from me.  NTA.", "NTA. It was 10 minutes.  You showed up, I fail to see the issue.  It's called an ETA for a reason.", "Coordinating timing perfectly when there are airplanes and airports involved is a fool's errand. There is an accepted amount of waiting involved in the operation. Sometimes it's the driver doing the waiting, sometimes it's the flyer. Getting bent out of shape about a 10-minute wait is ridiculous. NTA.", "NTA. There was no reason to expect that her flight would land 15 minutes early. And, even with that, she waited only 10 minutes--that is, five minutes less than any reasonable person would've expected in the same situation.\n\nEven at small airports, there's a bit of time between the plane landing and the person reaching the pick-up/parking area. So by arriving when you did, you could've expected to wait 10 minutes easily.\n\nShe's pissed off about something else (maybe you were expected to make a romantic gesture for Mother's Day) and redirecting it.\n\nFrom a comment, arriving *30 minutes* early to the airport is just stupid. By definition, you'd be waiting *at least* 30 minutes each time, even for flights that are on time. In response to that suggestion, I'd tell her to take an Uber too.", "NTA. 10 minutes? Really?", "It's hard to convey different parts of this story with the character limit.  To provide more info.   \n The original pick up time was 11:25 because I expected her to land either at 11:15 or 11:25 and take the additional 15 minutes to taxi and walk to the pick up area.  Leading up to that time frame was me helping our children set up a Mother's Day display for her at our house to surprise her when she returned.  I had operated all evening on the 11:25 timeframe, which was \"on-time\" according to the information she had provided me prior to taking off.  I had no idea that the plane would go from trying to land at 11:15 to landing at 11:00pm.  Last time I showed up early to pick her up, I ended up waiting in the cell phone lot for close to 90 minutes.  Makes me a little gun-shy.  \n\nWe both travel a lot for our jobs and pick each other up from the airport on a consistent basis.   \n The solution we came up with was just to always show up 30 minutes early prior to landing at all times.", "NTA - so what were you supposed to do?

I would understand if it was 20 minutes or more, but 10 minutes isn\u2019t a big deal. I think it also depends how big your airport is. Mine is massive and I always prefer for my husband to arrive a few minutes late, so he\u2019s not stuck circling around. (if the person you\u2019re picking up isn\u2019t outside at arrivals, you\u2019re not allowed to wait on them and it is a MASSIVE loop to get back to arrivals. The cell phone lot also takes about 10 minutes to get to arrivals, so there\u2019s no point in waiting there.)

You're not a mind reader or psychic are you?????    Yeah.", "NTA, first off why is a grown ass woman need picking up from the airport? Secondly, 10 minutes is not a long time to wait", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nYou told her to take a cab because you didnt listen to your wife, decided to show up late, and tried to blame her for not texting in-flight (which isn't usually possible). You were dismissive of her at every turn here, and that adds up to make you an asshole.\n\nE: Also, a 10 minute delay is nowhere near enough to justify changing your plans; those can be and are frequently made up.", "NTA, but good lord, just get a flight tracker app on your phone.\n\n(Full disclosure: I've been on delayed flights and the person picking me up has had to wait over an hour and a half, because the airport was 2 hours away from where we lived. Some things just can't be avoided.  But it sounds like you live practically next door to the airport, so there are no excuses for problems like this when you can use an app.  And for goodness' sake, I've waited 45 minutes for an Uber at O'Hare  during rush hour.  10 minutes waiting is NOTHING.)", "ESH - yes the Uber comment wasn't in the area of an apology and more of a dig, but she needs to deal  with the fact that you can't control when a plane arrives.  Ten minutes is nothing - I've done it for others and it changes all the time and I take an hour to drive to the airport so they know to just hold on tight if they arrive early by chance or I deal with it if they're running late.  No one can control the situation, including the pilot (other flights arriving, weather patterns, etc.).", "\"I admit my choice of words wasn't the best\" how is everyone glossing over THIS to focus on the \"ten minutes\". My guess is ESH, because it was close to midnight and y'all were probably tired and I'm guessing were rude to each other on the phone and that's what this mess is really about.  Oh AND the fact that OP said in a comment that they \"agreed to arrive 30 minutes before landing\" but then didn't even do that either????  Yeah, this  is about more than a ten minute wait.", "YTA.\n\nThere are multiple ways you can track a flight these days. If you have the flight number, you can easily track a flight. Heck, even knowing the airline, the departure airport, and original arrival time can be enough to search for a flight and track it. Personally, I used FlightAware for over a decade. Totally free and always keeps me up to date so I know when to be at the airport.", "NTA. Get new wife", "Ok you both need to learn something out of this.\n\n1. I've arranged for pick up at the airport countless times. I always try to be the one to wait rather than the person picking me up waiting because usually the airport doesn't allow cars waiting at the pick up area for long. 10 min is a short time to wait. Your wife is definitely the A H for this.\n\n2. You don't need your wife to tell you the time of the flight arrival. Check the airport website for this. It can easily change mid flight (as evident by this....) And my ride always knows to check so it saves both sides grieves. But I don't think you're at fault for not knowing, just something you should be aware of. \n\nI'd say you're NTA cuz it really shouldn't have caused any big reaction from your wife at all. I am someone who values punctuality, but pick up at airport right on time? That's just unrealistic.", "NTA. You acted reasonably and she\u2019s completely overreacting. \n\nEven if there was no confusion with the arrival times and you arrived 10 minutes late it\u2019s really not a big deal.", "YTA when my wife is on a plane and I'm going to pick her up I plan to get there early and wait for her parking near the airport and waiting for her to deplane, it would be a different story if it was 12:15 am or something like that but if it arrives at 11:15 you should plan to get there at 11 jic.", "Hmmm. So your wife is taking a flight and keeps texting you to update you about the flight status. She tells you that they are saying it may be 10 minutes late and you jump to telling her to take an Uber. Of course she got upset. How can you not see why? \n\nIn this situation, you go to the airport as planned. There is no difference between landing at 11:15 and 11:25. Those 10 minutes are nothing. She knows this. That is why she is upset. She also has no control of flight times and it is common for flights to land a few minutes earlier.  This is why we get to the airport to pick up people earlier than the set time for arrival. So she got even more upset when she was questioned for arriving early. \n\nYTA. You created drama for no reason and upset her over and over. The problem is that you seem to be totally clueless and self-absorbed. How can you not see the problem?", "YTA. My partner had that kind of habit too but I reminder her that when she picks up someone, she's the one to wait, not the person who's she's picking up. Unless of course she's coming from something important that she can't control the time manner. It made sense to her when I told her that. I would have been at the airport before 11 regardless if there's a delay whatsoever.", "INFO \n\nHow abandoned is your airport at that time? Is it a generally safe airport or can it feel sketchy?", "YTA because you dismissed her thinking you knew better and she was right. That\u2019s irritating.", "YTA for telling her she could take an Uber if she didn\u2019t want to wait and for adding the extra minutes and acting like it\u2019s her fault. \n\nDid you apologize to her for rudely telling her to get an Uber?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
