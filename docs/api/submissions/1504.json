They're also living together.\n\nTom's family is sweeping it completely under the rug, never to be talked about or acknowledged again. Being a survivor of s.a by a family member myself, I'm sure you can guess how I feel about all this and why they tried to hide it from me.\n Unfortunately for them, Tom can't keep a secret and he revealed to me after he had nightmare and woke up sobbing. I told EVERYONE in his family that Abby is not MY family. She is not my son's family. I and my son will not be anywhere she is.\n She is not invited to anything.

I don't think I will.\n\nSo reddit, would I truely be a childish petty bitch if my son and I do not go to the funeral because Abby will be there ?\n\nTbh I don't think toddlers belong at funerals anyway + I think we are all legit coming down with something after attending a friend's Halloween party.. not that his mother would believe it.", "created_utc": 1667629928, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymm9yg/wibta_for_not_attending_a_funeral_for_my_partners/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His family are all ah for allowing the sa to be ignored. They're making it clear that the kid who suffered is less to them than Abby. Stand your ground on this.", "YTA. You are taking this anger out on the wrong person. And save all the useless info. 'You don't get along with Abby' is enough of an explanation. We didn't need the novel.", "Yes, you WBTA. The funeral is to honour Charlotte, not Abby. You can ignore Abby.", "Info: What about Tom? Was he close to his grandmother? Does he need your support at the funeral? \nBecause going there wouldn't be about Charlotte or the rest of the family. It would be about Tom for you. \nIs he worth supporting him there?", "NTA. Not your family, not your issue. Sexual abuse aside \u2026. You and your son have nothing to do with the family so don\u2019t have to attend the funeral. Tom is welcome to go and should attend if he is inclined\u2026. But you and your son have zero obligation\n\nMy daughter lost so many of her close relatives and attended the funerals. Kids have to say goodbye as much if not more than adults\u2026. Because they don\u2019t have the closure that we do\u2026\u2026. But if your son has no connection to the people then no you still don\u2019t have to attend. \n\nHowever if your son has a relationship with the deceased and will not have an idea why they are no longer visiting them\u2026.. it is your duty to attend and help your son grieve and say goodbye .", "NTA\n\nAbby at least enabled her boyfriend to abuse her niece for 8 months and only told Charlotte because the boyfriend broke up with her. And she still is with the boyfriend after that.
