So you just looked at it and said yep, that's a finger alright, and then iced it. I've broken fingers before and you can't bend them or touch them without pain and it's very painful into the night. Sounds like she has a higher pain tolerance than you think. \n\nAlso, coming from someone who lives with chronic pain, sometimes debilitating, it's infuriating when people like you downplay the pain because you can't see it.", "YTA. Maybe her pain tolerance isn\u2019t as low as you assume. Perhaps her \u201clittle stomach pains\u201d are extreme. If the finger was broken, it would have been very bruised looking by the middle of the night. There was no way it looked \u201cfine.\u201d", "YTA. You say you didn\u2019t know it was broken, but the reality is you don\u2019t take her pain seriously. Every statement you made minimizes any of her complaints about pain.", "You aren't supposed to \"know\" it is broken, you are supposed to care enough to FIND OUT if it is broken. YTA.\n\nYou need to seriously decide if you care about your daughter enough to take care of her. That may sound mean, but you dismiss your daughter's awareness of her own body and call her dramatic. You are not in her body, how do you know what her pain tolerance is? Plus, smaller children have different reactions - I could shoulder through an injury but a stomach ache took me down- and you are holding on to how your now 14 year old has reacted to injury and illness throughout her whole life. You did not show basic care to your child when she asked for help, and you quickly dismissed her knowledge of her own body and STILL DO in this post even after knowing she had a painful injury. \n\nMore terrifying, is you are reinforcing to your daughter that she doesn't know her own body and is dramatic, and that is something that women deal with in healthcare their whole lives. There is so much evidence to support that, as women's pain is understudied and a lot of procedures that are only for a woman's anatomy (putting in an IUD, gyno procedures) do not get pain meds when procedures of similar invasiveness that are biology neutral or for men do receive pain meds. Most women still don't get diagnosed with significant issues based on their anatomy until something serious happens, after months or years of having pain ignored. \n\nAnd, it doesn't really matter what you believe about your daughter's pain threshold. You were wrong, period. She broke her finger and waited over 12 hours to have it taken care of. She clearly doesn't have a low pain threshold, and if you think otherwise, break your own finger and leave it untreated for 12-24 hours and see how that feels. \n\nLearn the lesson here. Apologize, tell your daughter to listen to her own body. And BTW, what would have been the harm in taking her seriously? You would have lost a few hours of time at an urgent care or doctor's? Is that time really worth more to you than your daughter's health and comfort?", "Yes YTA. And a terrible parent at that.", "You you say \u201cshe just wants pain killers\u201d, do you mean tylenol or advil?  Did you refuse to give your child basic OTC meds because you think she\u2019s faking?  \nIf she has a very low pain tolerance, SHES IN PAIN. \nAbsolutely YTA, and what your ex called you. You should be ashamed of yourself for neglecting your child.", " \u201cI\u2019m an asshole, am I an asshole?\u201d\n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nMaybe when she fell it didn\u2019t seem too serious but when she woke you up in the middle of night regardless of her pain tolerance it still would have been broken and needed checking and even tho you didn\u2019t know you still could have quickly gone to the doctor and had them take a look and if it was nothing then it was nothing but it\u2019s always best to check and also her finger would not have looked \u201c fine\u201d as it was not just a small sprain or fracture it was broken so it would have been bruised up a little or noticeable that something was wrong", "YTA\n\nThe moment she woke up and it STILL HURT, alarm bells should have started ringing.", ">I looked at her finger and it was fine\n\n>We went to the doctor's office and apparebtly she had a broken bone\n\nSo that was a lie. YTA. If your kid has a broken bone, you go to a doctor. You don't tell her to ice it and say it will be fine.", "Big YTA, if my child wakes up in the middle of the night from pain, I am taking them to the hospital.", "YTA.  Reminds me of a good friend who, as a child, broke his collarbone.  His Mom....who thought she knew everything....was sure it was fine.  So he walked around deformed and in pain until she finally admitted she didn't know what she was talking about. If your child is hurt listen to them and seek professional help.  Don't play doctor.", "YTA. Fingers aren't supposed to hurt after you fall, especially the morning after.", "YTA 100%. You let your daughter suffer with a broken bone overnight. I have two kids and couldn't imagine treating them like that. Honestly, don't be surprised if you lose custody of your daughter for that because it shows what kind of parent you are.", "YTA.  But not just because you didn't take her this time.  You are not listening to your child, and you're marginalizing her as a separate person.  So what if she has a low pain tolerance?!  If she says something hurts, something hurts!  Just because it might not hurt you as badly doesn't mean that her pain isn't real.  The remark about pain killers is really telling.  You don't want her taking pain killers \"for no reason.\"  How do you get to judge whether there's a \"good\" reason or not?!   No wonder the poor kid didn't tell you when it happened, you've clearly already decided that anything she tells you related to this is an exaggeration.  You need to take a really good look at how you're treating your kid.  She's not just an extension of you.  She's a real person who isn't even allowed to express her own experience of pain.", "YTA, I'm glad your daughter has at least one parent who listens to her when something serious comes up. Maybe next time actually listen to your daughter rather than blow her off because you think she's too dramatic.", "YTA and you're probably gonna get a visit from CPS. I work for CPS and this is the exact kind of shit we take kids away for.", "YTA.\n\nHOW were you supposed to know it was broken? By taking her to a doctor.", "YTA\n\nYou need a better way to gauge pain than tears. Some kids cry over the least little thing. \n\nCheck out the various pain charts easily available on the internet. Have your kids use those, or some other method of describing their pain, rather than you deciding their tears don't mean anything. \n\nI think all parents miss some sign of illness/injury at some point,  but most of them don't blame the child for that.", "YTA don't be surprised when she stop telling you when she's in pain because she knows you will belittle her", "YTA. Your daughter is a sensitive being, and you treat her with the utmost contempt. She may not have a high pain tolerance, but that does not mean you should ever brush her off just because you do not agree with the way she reacts to certain situations. Parents are supposed to be kind and understanding and empathetic toward their children. You are none of these things. All you are teaching her is that she cannot rely on you when she is experiencing pain and discomfort, no matter how big or small.", "I'm going with a soft YTA, mainly because I've broken both my arm and my leg and neither of them was really obvious and I didn't see a doctor the same day. It's not always a clean break (my husband did that) so waiting for a while to see if it passes is reasonable. Especially if the option is the ER in the middle of the night (should be avoided if you can). So I can get you waiting it out until the morning but when she STILL was in pain, then you should have taken her to the doctor. Apologize to both your daughter and your ex.", "YTA. My mom did this to me. I was jumping on a trampoline got bounced high and landed on the ground breaking my collarbone. Since nothing looked bad and \u201cyou have a low pain tolerance\u201d my mom didn\u2019t take me to the Dr. My dad who was in a different state didn\u2019t give a crap about me. My mom finally took me to the Dr when the school nurse told my mom she needed to take me and that was a week later. It sucks when a parent doesn\u2019t believe you\u2019re in pain or something else is wrong. I feel for your daughter and hopefully this is a life lesson for you.", "I\u2019ve never seen someone falling and getting a bruise on their finger I would have been concerned from that moment instead of assuming she\u2019s being dramatic. My son came back from his dads complaining of a stomachache he completely ignored it and when I got him back he wasn\u2019t acting like himself I assumed he was just tired and when I asked his dad he dismissed it and said he was constipated, I was not convinced but took him on his word, I didn\u2019t connect the dots until the next morning and he showed me where the pain was. He also failed to mention he had constant pain on abdomen rather than a intermittent pain caused by a stomach upset. It turned out to be appendicitis it actually burst. I was actually furious and he never took any responsibility for it either but that\u2019s a normal thing for him anyway he never does. I really don\u2019t blame your husband for lashing out. You should never just dismiss children if they are in pain especially if they come to you more than once. They often don\u2019t have the words explain what they are feeling. I honestly don\u2019t understand why you are wondering if you are TA you should apologies to your child profusely and admit your wrongs if you don\u2019t want her to think you don\u2019t give a shit about her.", "YTA. Just give your daughter to her father. She doesn\u2019t need your drama in her life. She needs a parent who loves her and listens to her when she says she\u2019s in pain. You don\u2019t even like your daughter. Do this one thing that\u2019s in her best interests and you\u2019re rid of her for good.

I\u2019m dismissed constantly by the people who should be helping me.\n\nIt got so bad that I need a wheelchair for big events now. I also had a VERY LARGE ovarian cyst rupture and bleed because no one took it seriously and thought it was \u2018just stomach pain, take an ibuprofen\u2019. \n\nYou. Are going.

I've gone for an x-ray and it wasnt broken and I've held back and ended up going in the middle of the night when I should have gone earlier and felt like crap for waiting. \n\nThe rule of thumb is, kids sleep, if she woke up from the pain, it's real pain, you should have brought her to a+e there and then, YTA for not going at that stage.", "YTA.", "YTA- Kids fall and get hurt.

You are not in your child\u2019s head or body, so you are    Not qualified to make a decision as to what hurts what hurts badly and what doesn\u2019t hurt at all.

And \u201cshe knows I dont like to give her painkillers for no reason\u201d but THERE WAS A REASON?! she\u2019s waking you up in the middle of the night in pain with a bruised finger for a fall that you saw happen and you still couldn\u2019t even give her a couple ibuprofen?!\n\nYou honestly sound like you don\u2019t even like your daughter or like she\u2019s the first dramatic 14 year old girl.

There was no good reason for you not to give her pain meds, and there was no good reason for you to not say \"no, I'm the parent. If it hurts enough for you to be awake and wake me up, then you need to see a doctor. Go get your shoes.\"", "This should be reported to child protective services", "This response\u2026 You are a terrible parent. You don\u2019t even like your own kid. You hate that she cries. And you don\u2019t her seriously. She should not be living with you whatsoever. YTA.", "Aaaand that\u2019s why YTA. Yikes yikes yikes.", "Was she crying this time? Doesn\u2019t sound like it. And you still didn\u2019t take her seriously.", "... Get some help.  You need it.", "Why didn't you just give her pain killers? You say you don't like her taking medication for no reason, but you witnessed her have a fall and then she continuously complained about pain and REQUESTED PAIN KILLERS, NOT ICE. Your ex was justified in calling you the c word.", "Way to blame your child for your failure as a parent.", "holy cow that statement alone makes u the uber A-hole!", "wow just WOW! Yta!", "\"Well if she didn't cry about everything I would have taken her pain seriously\"\n\nObviously, you think she's being dramatic often. So I'm betting it's more than one mistake. Seems like this is a regular assumption on your part.", "Doubt this is the first mistake, but hopefully it will be your last. She deserves to live with her father.", "no, you're coming across as a  bad parent because even in your comments you are dismissive of your daughters feelings and clearly do not regret that you didn't take her seriously. you do not even come across as a parent who likes their kid with how you speak of her both in your post and especially in your comments.", "Yes, because of that one mistake. So guess what, when something actually serious happens that\u2019s life-threatening, she won\u2019t come to you\u2026 Because you\u2019re just gonna tell her off thinking it\u2019s no big deal.", "Yes, you have only provided us with one mistake. And judging by the way you responded, and have been responding your attitude towards her pain is normal, and this isn't just a one time occurrence. She's still a child. You don't have her body and don't know her pain. What could be very mild for you personally could be very painful for her and you wouldn't even know it. You are being very hurtful to your daughter by being so dismissive of her pain, whether it's small or not. You're not in the right. Accept that.", "Why would you come here looking for judgement and then argue that you\u2019re not at fault with every commenter? You\u2019re in the wrong\u2026very obviously", "You are continually downplaying her complaints of pain in every statement. Children have pain. They hurt. Your job is to investigate and take her to the doctor. You just pooh-pooh her complaints and say she's a crybaby. Give your child the same courtesy you'd give a friend or coworker.", "No, because you show nothing but contempt for your daughter. This is just one time you got caught. And BTW, doctors look into things like this, especially when parents delay medical care.", "It's not a Single mistakes, it's a Series of dismissal. Even when she asked for pain Killers you said no. How cruel you are!", "You also refused to give her anything for the pain aside from ice", "Not letting your kids take any minor pain medicine also qualifies you as a terrible parent", "You\u2019re a terrible parent because of your asshole comments not just you\u2019re \u2018one\u2019 mistake. I have a major feeling that this isn\u2019t just one mistake. You\u2019re a terrible parent. Your daughter deserves better. She should not be living with you.", "It\u2019s not just the mistake it\u2019s that\u2019s you don\u2019t even think you did anything wrong go and apologies to your kid and tell her you will do better next time", "You don't mention, I don't know, APOLOGIZING TO YOUR DAUGHTER or anything, it's just you whining.", "Then you didn\u2019t look at her finger.", "Like I said. You claiming to have looked at it and determined it was fine was a lie. The finger was **not** fine. So either you're not capable of determining when a kid needs to go to a doctor, or you didn't look at it at all and just brushed her off. Either way, YTA.", "So you say, you didn\u2019t know it was broken\u2026 You didn\u2019t know that it wasn\u2019t broken, obviously\u2026 Because it was broken.\n\nTalk about being a neglectful parent.", "I have had broken fingers that haven't been swollen or black and blue.  But you should have taken her in the morning to have it checked out.", "Of course you didn't, you're not a doctor. What you are, is a parent. So, while it isn't your job to know a broken bone when you see it, it IS your job to take care of your kids when they have a problem, not just dismiss their concerns because it's inconvenient for you.", "You know how you can find out if it\u2019s broken? By taking her to the doctor.", "Thats why you go to a doctor!", "Unless it\u2019s abdominal pain that\u2019s gone on for hours never leave it until the morning it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry", "So 'trying to play hero' cause he listened to your daughter? YTA", "\"there was no way I could've known\" \n\nShe fell. She cried. She woke you up. She told you she was in pain. There were plenty of ways you COULD have known, you're just so self centered and dismissive you didn't care to listen.\n\n>Her dad was just trying to play the hero\n\nThank God one of that child's parents is, because if it was left to you she wouldn't have any. What a sad mother, actually upset that her child's father cares about her child. Truly what is wrong with you?", "Its called medical neglect cps takes kids away from better parents than you for this and to be fair you play a good villain.", "No way you could have known?  You were told.", "You have justified this to yourself and you don\u2019t even feel bad about it. I would feel absolutely terrible. You can make mistakes but why don\u2019t you feel bad that\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. My son was feeling unwell I honestly thought it was a cold and I sent him to school anyway when I realised my mistake I felt absolutely awful about it and I apologised to him. You are going to ruin your relationship with your child by being unable to admit your wrongs.", "...and it was indeed broken. She had broken a bone.  He was right.  You were wrong.\n\nChrist.", "It\u2019s kinda warranted given the level of neglect from OP.", "Except she was absolutely being a C", "It depends on where it is broken", "Lol right. Why is this person even a mother", "Or the daughter\u2019s pain tolerance is fine, but mother\u2019s distress tolerance is near zero and she goes straight to denial", "No she doesn't, she has contempt for her.  \n\nHer daughter is a annoyance.", "My son gets really quiet when he\u2019s ill it\u2019s my first red flag", "I did. I just don't have x-ray vision", "Spending the whole night in the ER waiting for a doctor with your children? Not if you can avoid it. So it really depends on the situation. \n\nIt was a finger, it could have just been a sprain but when the child STILL was in pain in the morning, then OP really should have taken her to the doctor. But going to the ER in the middle of the night for a finger? Than it really has to be BAD! Miscoloring, loss of sensation, swelling, etc. Otherwise wait until the morning.", "[deleted]", "She is cold hearted, her heart froze a long time ago and she feels no pain because pain receptors are dead.", "Some people shouldn\u2019t be mothers sadly.", "You know who does have x-rays? The doctor's office. That's where you can find x-ray vision. Your kid can have x-rays done at a doctor's office. I'm not sure why you had to learn this fact from reddit, but here we are.", "Then you saw the bruising that showed her finger was broken and ignored it.\n\nBetter to say you didn\u2019t bother to look than to admit to ignoring the obvious injury.", "That\u2019s what you go to a place that *has* X-rays.", "Wow...if only there was a device that does have xray vision...", "Sorry I just re read what wrote and it makes no sense what i meant to say is some things can wait until the morning but things like abdominal pain cannot because it can easily be something serious especially if it\u2019s prolonged localised abdominal pain. So yes I agree with with the wait and see approach especially if it\u2019s at night. My daughter twisted her ankle and it swelled up so I just monitored her until i was sure it was just sprained, in the meantime I bought her a bunch of stuff to manage the pain. In this case she didn\u2019t show any concern at all, she didn\u2019t offer her pain management or comfort and even now that she\u2019s found out about her mistake she\u2019s still not admitting to it.", "Yeah, that's not always the case. A quick google search would show you that you're wrong. \n\nI broke my finger a few year ago and could still move it just fine. It hurt like hell any time I moved it, but I still had the full range of movement. I didn't even know it was broken until a week or so later when I finally went to the doctor because the pain was still so severe.", "Not entirely true. A fracture still counts as a broken bone but she would still be able to move it. We don't know the severity of the break.", "That made much more sense!\n\nYes, abdominal pain should always be taken very serious!", "[deleted]", "Fracture is the medical term for any broken bone. It can range from a small crack (hairline fracture) to a situation where the broken bone has actually poked through the skin (compound fracture). \n\nSome fractures are caused by repeated use (stress fracture) and not a catastrophic event (like the fall here).\n\nMany fractures do not prevent movement of the affected area. All fractures require medical attention to ensure proper healing.\n\nHere OP's daughter was in such pain that she could not sleep and OP disregarded it. YTA."]}
