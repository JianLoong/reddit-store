So you just looked at it and said yep, that's a finger alright, and then iced it. I've broken fingers before and you can't bend them or touch them without pain and it's very painful into the night. Sounds like she has a higher pain tolerance than you think. \n\nAlso, coming from someone who lives with chronic pain, sometimes debilitating, it's infuriating when people like you downplay the pain because you can't see it.", "YTA. Maybe her pain tolerance isn\u2019t as low as you assume. Perhaps her \u201clittle stomach pains\u201d are extreme. If the finger was broken, it would have been very bruised looking by the middle of the night. There was no way it looked \u201cfine.\u201d", "YTA. You say you didn\u2019t know it was broken, but the reality is you don\u2019t take her pain seriously. Every statement you made minimizes any of her complaints about pain.", "You aren't supposed to \"know\" it is broken, you are supposed to care enough to FIND OUT if it is broken. YTA.\n\nYou need to seriously decide if you care about your daughter enough to take care of her. That may sound mean, but you dismiss your daughter's awareness of her own body and call her dramatic. You are not in her body, how do you know what her pain tolerance is? Plus, smaller children have different reactions - I could shoulder through an injury but a stomach ache took me down- and you are holding on to how your now 14 year old has reacted to injury and illness throughout her whole life. You did not show basic care to your child when she asked for help, and you quickly dismissed her knowledge of her own body and STILL DO in this post even after knowing she had a painful injury. \n\nMore terrifying, is you are reinforcing to your daughter that she doesn't know her own body and is dramatic, and that is something that women deal with in healthcare their whole lives. There is so much evidence to support that, as women's pain is understudied and a lot of procedures that are only for a woman's anatomy (putting in an IUD, gyno procedures) do not get pain meds when procedures of similar invasiveness that are biology neutral or for men do receive pain meds. Most women still don't get diagnosed with significant issues based on their anatomy until something serious happens, after months or years of having pain ignored. \n\nAnd, it doesn't really matter what you believe about your daughter's pain threshold. You were wrong, period. She broke her finger and waited over 12 hours to have it taken care of. She clearly doesn't have a low pain threshold, and if you think otherwise, break your own finger and leave it untreated for 12-24 hours and see how that feels. \n\nLearn the lesson here. Apologize, tell your daughter to listen to her own body. And BTW, what would have been the harm in taking her seriously? You would have lost a few hours of time at an urgent care or doctor's? Is that time really worth more to you than your daughter's health and comfort?", "Yes YTA. And a terrible parent at that.", "You you say \u201cshe just wants pain killers\u201d, do you mean tylenol or advil?  Did you refuse to give your child basic OTC meds because you think she\u2019s faking?  \nIf she has a very low pain tolerance, SHES IN PAIN. \nAbsolutely YTA, and what your ex called you. You should be ashamed of yourself for neglecting your child.", " \u201cI\u2019m an asshole, am I an asshole?\u201d\n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nMaybe when she fell it didn\u2019t seem too serious but when she woke you up in the middle of night regardless of her pain tolerance it still would have been broken and needed checking and even tho you didn\u2019t know you still could have quickly gone to the doctor and had them take a look and if it was nothing then it was nothing but it\u2019s always best to check and also her finger would not have looked \u201c fine\u201d as it was not just a small sprain or fracture it was broken so it would have been bruised up a little or noticeable that something was wrong", "YTA\n\nThe moment she woke up and it STILL HURT, alarm bells should have started ringing.", ">I looked at her finger and it was fine\n\n>We went to the doctor's office and apparebtly she had a broken bone\n\nSo that was a lie. YTA. If your kid has a broken bone, you go to a doctor. You don't tell her to ice it and say it will be fine.", "Big YTA, if my child wakes up in the middle of the night from pain, I am taking them to the hospital.", "YTA.  Reminds me of a good friend who, as a child, broke his collarbone.  His Mom....who thought she knew everything....was sure it was fine.  So he walked around deformed and in pain until she finally admitted she didn't know what she was talking about. If your child is hurt listen to them and seek professional help.  Don't play doctor.", "YTA. Fingers aren't supposed to hurt after you fall, especially the morning after.", "YTA 100%. You let your daughter suffer with a broken bone overnight. I have two kids and couldn't imagine treating them like that. Honestly, don't be surprised if you lose custody of your daughter for that because it shows what kind of parent you are.", "YTA.  But not just because you didn't take her this time.  You are not listening to your child, and you're marginalizing her as a separate person.  So what if she has a low pain tolerance?!  If she says something hurts, something hurts!  Just because it might not hurt you as badly doesn't mean that her pain isn't real.  The remark about pain killers is really telling.  You don't want her taking pain killers \"for no reason.\"  How do you get to judge whether there's a \"good\" reason or not?!   No wonder the poor kid didn't tell you when it happened, you've clearly already decided that anything she tells you related to this is an exaggeration.  You need to take a really good look at how you're treating your kid.  She's not just an extension of you.  She's a real person who isn't even allowed to express her own experience of pain.", "YTA, I'm glad your daughter has at least one parent who listens to her when something serious comes up. Maybe next time actually listen to your daughter rather than blow her off because you think she's too dramatic.", "YTA and you're probably gonna get a visit from CPS. I work for CPS and this is the exact kind of shit we take kids away for.\n\nEdit: so far under this comment I've had one person tell me that this is why they don't believe in taking children to the hospital and someone say I must be lying because their ex CPS wife never would take away for medical neglect (wonder why they no longer work for CPS)", "YTA.\n\nHOW were you supposed to know it was broken? By taking her to a doctor.", "YTA\n\nYou need a better way to gauge pain than tears. Some kids cry over the least little thing. \n\nCheck out the various pain charts easily available on the internet. Have your kids use those, or some other method of describing their pain, rather than you deciding their tears don't mean anything. \n\nI think all parents miss some sign of illness/injury at some point,  but most of them don't blame the child for that.", "YTA don't be surprised when she stop telling you when she's in pain because she knows you will belittle her", "YTA. Your daughter is a sensitive being, and you treat her with the utmost contempt. She may not have a high pain tolerance, but that does not mean you should ever brush her off just because you do not agree with the way she reacts to certain situations. Parents are supposed to be kind and understanding and empathetic toward their children. You are none of these things. All you are teaching her is that she cannot rely on you when she is experiencing pain and discomfort, no matter how big or small.", "I'm going with a soft YTA, mainly because I've broken both my arm and my leg and neither of them was really obvious and I didn't see a doctor the same day. It's not always a clean break (my husband did that) so waiting for a while to see if it passes is reasonable. Especially if the option is the ER in the middle of the night (should be avoided if you can). So I can get you waiting it out until the morning but when she STILL was in pain, then you should have taken her to the doctor. Apologize to both your daughter and your ex.", "YTA. My mom did this to me. I was jumping on a trampoline got bounced high and landed on the ground breaking my collarbone. Since nothing looked bad and \u201cyou have a low pain tolerance\u201d my mom didn\u2019t take me to the Dr. My dad who was in a different state didn\u2019t give a crap about me. My mom finally took me to the Dr when the school nurse told my mom she needed to take me and that was a week later. It sucks when a parent doesn\u2019t believe you\u2019re in pain or something else is wrong. I feel for your daughter and hopefully this is a life lesson for you.", "I\u2019ve never seen someone falling and getting a bruise on their finger I would have been concerned from that moment instead of assuming she\u2019s being dramatic. My son came back from his dads complaining of a stomachache he completely ignored it and when I got him back he wasn\u2019t acting like himself I assumed he was just tired and when I asked his dad he dismissed it and said he was constipated, I was not convinced but took him on his word, I didn\u2019t connect the dots until the next morning and he showed me where the pain was. He also failed to mention he had constant pain on abdomen rather than a intermittent pain caused by a stomach upset. It turned out to be appendicitis it actually burst. I was actually furious and he never took any responsibility for it either but that\u2019s a normal thing for him anyway he never does. I really don\u2019t blame your husband for lashing out. You should never just dismiss children if they are in pain especially if they come to you more than once. They often don\u2019t have the words explain what they are feeling. I honestly don\u2019t understand why you are wondering if you are TA you should apologies to your child profusely and admit your wrongs if you don\u2019t want her to think you don\u2019t give a shit about her.", "YTA. Just give your daughter to her father. She doesn\u2019t need your drama in her life. She needs a parent who loves her and listens to her when she says she\u2019s in pain. You don\u2019t even like your daughter. Do this one thing that\u2019s in her best interests and you\u2019re rid of her for good.

I've gone for an x-ray and it wasnt broken and I've held back and ended up going in the middle of the night when I should have gone earlier and felt like crap for waiting. \n\nThe rule of thumb is, kids sleep, if she woke up from the pain, it's real pain, you should have brought her to a+e there and then, YTA for not going at that stage.", "YTA.", "YTA- Kids fall and get hurt.

Crying easily and having a low-pain tolerance doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t also have legitimate pain? Are you insane? What would it take for you to take her pain seriously, a limb falling off? And \u201cshe knows I dont like to give her painkillers for no reason\u201d but THERE WAS A REASON?! she\u2019s waking you up in the middle of the night in pain with a bruised finger for a fall that you saw happen and you still couldn\u2019t even give her a couple ibuprofen?!\n\nYou honestly sound like you don\u2019t even like your daughter or like she\u2019s the first dramatic 14 year old girl.

And your attitude in these comments is gross too.", "YTA.  How were you supposed to know it was broken?  That's why we have xray machines.  They let you know things like that.

I was so convinced as a teen that everyone felt the same level of pain as me that I just... stopped making any noise about my pain. I'm only recently learning to talk to my doctors about it again.\n\nNever taking your child's pain seriously has some insanely long-lasting consequences. OP is an AH, and pain should at least be properly acknowledged.", "OP isn\u2018t supposed to know how to diagnose a broken bone. Instead a good mother would take her to someone who can. Like a doctor. \n\nYTA", "Yeah. This is ridiculous. How was she going to know if she didn\u2019t take the kid to the doctor? You don\u2019t always \u201csee\u201d broken bones and even doctors use, you know, X-rays and stuff for that. The kid had an impact and complained of pain that wasn\u2019t abating. I would get not taking the kid to the doctor right away if they said they were fine after an impact. But if you don\u2019t listen to their pain, how would you ever \u201cdecide\u201d its doctor time?\n\nAnd not giving the kid even OTC pain medication is wild\u2014I wasn\u2019t asking for that by 14 and could use as needed!", "I don't care about the finger or the father or the details. I don't even need to read about them to know YTA because your whole post is hyper defensive, selfish, blaming your daughter for everything, full of disdain for her and treating her like crap.\n\nThe finger is the least of her worries.", "And some family therapy", "Ooh, yeah that's a sad reality for a lot of people. After so long though the pain you feel would be completely different for most people, so you tell them for you it's a 4, to most it would be a 7 and they don't take you as serious sometimes.", "As soon as a parent says their kid is \"always being dramatic\" I judge them. I try not to, but it means the parent is either dismissing them, or they're seeking attention that the parents don't give them any other way.", "I knew someone whose parents disregarded their stomach pain for years, and they ended up having 5+ stomach ulcers.", "Endo haver here! Took me 10 years to get diagnosed and that\u2019s the average. Multiple doctors told me my pain was normal. I might never be able to have kids because it wasn\u2019t caught early. I could have potential organ damage. It is more likely to come back now. \n\nMoral of the story\u2026 believe people when they are being open and vulnerable about their body.", "Tylenol isn't the safe little medication you might think it is. Mixing Tylenol and ibuprofen can have serious side effects. Long term liver side effects are very real. Personally, I never took Tylenol just because it never helped my pain nor took out a fever. I would give ibuprofen any day over Tylenol. Just me.", "\"how was I supposed to know it was broken?\"", "Actually the fall itself was reason enough to get the painkiller Imo so the daughter could sleep until morning and then go to the doctor.", "Actually this can fuck up their use of the hand for life if untreated - bone doesn't set right , need to broken again /surgery etc.\n\nYTA op you aren't a doctor and even them use medical equipment not only their knowledge to diagnose.\n\nGet your kid( if you still have custody that is) to a doctor when they complain", "Yup like I have fybro so sometimes my working normal is a 3 and I just get on with my day that's normal. Now I have a slipped disc killing me (surgery tomorrow finally thank fucky fuck) and sometimes the pain is so bad I'm pretty sure some people would just pass out.but I'm made of pain now and I just... go grocery shopping cause it's what I have to do and I'll cry later. When you tell a specialist your pains a 7-9 and then you get up and walk around they don't fucking believe you. Because you're not a puddle on the floor because if you were you'd never get anything done again and its been reality for 18 months. \n\nIts like do I give you a real number or just say you won't believe me.", "I went to the ER with severe pain and heavy bleeding. I'd already spent several hours at home passing blood clots bigger than a golf ball. They tried to tell me it was just my period; it was a miscarriage, and I passed the fetal tissue in one solid mass on the toilet. I must've bled so much that the amniotic sac burst, because I held the fetus in my hand.", "I didn't get pain killers for my then very very painful periods as a teen, because it's not an illness.", "I have. Thanks\n\nI wonder if I would be alive if my parents were anything like OP. I doubt it", "There are times when as a parent you need to make the final decision. This was one of those times. Asking is fine but as the adult & parent, you need to be able to gauge what is serious & what isn\u2019t for a hospital stay. And i doubt if she said yes, OP actually would have taken her anyway without trying to guilt trip her. Also if she doesn\u2019t like her taking meds and just how much op likes to downplay her pain, her daughter probably said no bc she knows that\u2019s what her parent wants to hear. In this case, asking wasn\u2019t OP being a genuinely good parent especially after her child just woke her up in the middle of the night. Like this is very specifically speaking not generally speaking.\n\nThat\u2019s why the person u responded to, added \u201cmostly as a parent who minimizes pain\u201d she\u2019s saying why did OP ask knowing all this. They aren\u2019t being specific to u or anyone else.", "> I eventually just gave up and refused to ever eat anything they prepare. On the bright side, since then I've taken to ruining family gatherings as revenge by showing up with a stack of pizzas every time - so all of the kids refuse to eat anything they cooked\n\nKarma is best served with pizza", "As someone who\u2019s endometriosis pain was dismissed for many years, I ignored a lot of pains that I absolutely shouldn\u2019t have. By insisting my period pains weren\u2019t a big deal, I got it in my head that anything less painful than that wasn\u2019t worth a doctor\u2019s visit. The trouble is, that\u2019s still the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced. I have some injuries that will plague me for the rest of my life because I didn\u2019t address them properly when it happened.", "Honestly it really depends on the kid. \n\nMy kid is fifteen now, and she's been allowed to get Tylenol, and Advil on her own for about a year or so. She does still have to ask first just to make sure she's not taking them too close together, or too much at a time(we have different dosages), but she's allowed to get them herself.\n\nThings like allergy, and cold medications are always adult administered though, because they're both things that can cause cognitive impairments, and lead to things like forgetting you've taken them, and accidentally double dosing. \n\nRefusing to allow a 14 year old to take NSAIDs for situational pain management though is just weird, and frankly cruel.", "This comment needs to be the main one OP sees \u261d\ufe0f", "Let me tell you how lucky my sister got when my niece had an ovarian torsion when she was 11.  My sister knew her pain levels were off, her GP wasn't positive what it was, but took her pain seriously and sent her to the ER, there they also took it seriously and did the ultrasound the GP asked for.  They saved her ovary because of my sister's quick thinking and doctors actually believing her pain.  It probably didn't hurt that my sister is a farmer and has the muscles to go with it.  She does not like like someone to mess with."]}
