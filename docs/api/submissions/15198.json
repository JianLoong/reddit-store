Additionally, I am posting this on a burner account because we don't want her other biological family to know about this.\n\nMy husband and I adopted our daughter when she was six months old. We are both Mexican, as are her two siblings, but our daughter is black. She knows that she is adopted and that she is actually West African, but she identifies as black and is very connected to Mexican culture because that's how she was raised.\n\nRecently, our daughter had her Quincea\u00f1era to celebrate her 15th birthday. She posted photos and videos of the celebration on her social media accounts, there is  mentions of her West African heritage in her bios tho. Unfortunately, this led to a flood of hate comments and even racial slurs about how she is black and therefore cannot have a Quincea\u00f1era, even if she is adopted.\n\nThe situation quickly escalated into death threats, and our daughter was understandably distraught. She came to me crying and showed me the comments, messages, and threats she had received. Most of the people attacking her weren't Hispanic in the first place, and some even tried to physically harm her at her school after seeing the post because they believed she was \"stealing their Hispanic culture.\"\n\nMy daughter has since deleted both her Instagram and TikTok accounts, but the bullying and harassment have continued. We pulled her out of school for her safety after receiving threats from her classmates, but I still feel terrible for allowing her to have a Quincea\u00f1era in the first place. I had no idea it would result in such a negative reaction.\n\nSo now I'm left wondering: was I wrong to let my black daughter have a Quincea\u00f1era? Should I have been more aware of the potential backlash and protected her from it? I feel like a terrible parent and am desperately seeking guidance. Am I the asshole here??", "created_utc": 1681928975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s5kvt/aita_for_letting_my_black_daughter_have_a/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

By allowing her to celebrate a tradition that is not part of her cultural heritage, I may have unintentionally opened her up to harassment and bullying from others who felt that she was appropriating their culture. Additionally, by not fully understanding the potential consequences of her sharing her celebration on social media, I may have put her in harm's way and exposed her to even more vitriol and hatred. Though my intentions were pure and I only wanted to give my daughter a special day to celebrate her transition into adulthood, I now realize that I may have made a mistake and that my actions may have caused her undue harm and trauma.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You were giving her a celebration that is culturally appropriate for her upbringing by Mexican parents.

Maybe you guys can make a video with her that just talks about what it\u2019s like to be in your mixed family. Share nice things, including planning a quince for your daughter and how that showcases her inclusion in the family culture. Most importantly, call out the racism directly. The school might be willing to show it to the class and have a discussion about why the attacks on your daughter were racist and ethnocentric even though the perpetrators thought they were calling out cultural appropriation. If you\u2019re up for it, you could reach out to someone who already makes videos or does research on this topic and ask for their help.

This is awesome!", "NTA there are people who want to protect their culture and there are people who want to just use it as an excuse to exclude others. \n\nYour daughter is correct in how she identifies. This is actually really healthy that you gave her a quincenera and that she shows connection to both cultures. \n\nShe is your daughter.
