I was his History teacher last year and am now teaching him another subject, and being the S\u00e9timo Ano (I have no idea as to how that translates to the country of whomever is reading this, but they are 12 to 13 generally), we talked about colonization and racism here in Brazil. He had an special interest in it and was very strongly opinionated in how it was wrong and abhorrent, so you can imagine my surprise when I heard this two weeks ago, specially because these two kids used to be friends last year, as far as I could remember. \n\nI knew that the School Administration had already punished the boy for it and all that, but it still seemed so out of character for him. It didn't fit with the boy that I had taught less than a year ago at this point to do such a thing. When I had a window between classes, I asked for the teacher that was teaching him and pulled him aside. I talked to him about the last year's subject, which he showed that he remembered it just well, and that he still held the same opinions and he knew that what he did was wrong, so I asked him why he did it then. It turns out that the boy had trusted the other one with the secret that his father is incarcerated. They had a falling out and the other boy started calling his father \"Presidi\u00e1rio\" (Convict) and calling him \"Filho de preso\" (Convict's son). And, at the height of his rage and pain, he was just so goddamn mad that he just wanted to hurt the other boy, and he knew how, and so he did it.\n\nSo, information on the backgrounds can matter in *some* cases.
