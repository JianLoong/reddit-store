It may seem costly but I assure you your son, his friend and the child's parents will TRULY appreciate it. My parents often had to do this for me so I didn't feel constantly left out of cool/fun events it helped ease the sting of exclusion.\n\nAlso in the FUTURE make sure never to do this again, if they remain lifelong friends go ABOVE and BEYOND to make sure future parties are inclusive to any disabilities or accessible for your son's best friend.

I'm just speaking from secondhand experience knowing my cousin all 22 years of his life, but he would feel guilty AF if he knew a friend of his changed their plans because of him.  That's not what acceptance is.  Is your son going to skip riding a bike and playing sports to spare his friends feelings?  Come on now!  You're the only reasonable one here, IMO.

I personally haven't been to many but every one I have been to has had something for everyone including accomodations for wheelchairs and wheelchair bound people.

Should the birthday kid never play tag with friends or go swimming with friends because a friend might be left out? There's plenty of other times that are naturally inclusive and although it sucks, but with assurance that they're still best friends, he's done nothing wrong, and other events where he can participate, the wheelchair bound kid should understand that while it sucks, it's going to be fine, and the birthday kid maybe shouldn't miss out on this one. By that, I also mean that even if he didn't have that kind of party, and was taken with all the other friends another time (because that's the only way to actually have the experience he's been wanting,) then the wheelchair bound kid would also feel just as left out. \n\nI'm leaning towards no assholes here, it's just a shitty situation.", "Oh, FFS. \n\nI can't get out of my wheelchair and go jump on the trampolines, either.  \"Wheelchair bound\" is aptly descriptive.

Son was probably just thinking about what he wanted and not giving a lot of thought to his friend's feelings. Then, they found out friend wasn't coming. Son didn't ask to change anything, but then wife talked to son. Wife changed son's mind and now he wants to change locations so his friend can come.\n\nThis is making OP feel like it's not his son's \"real\" opinion since his wife changed his mind. In specific he thinks that wife has made son afraid he'll lose his friendship if he does the trampoline park event. This may well be true. I'm not saying this to judge wife. Often, children can be thoughtless and parents talk to them to help them think empathically and/or tell them to be better friends. Parents may well tell their children if they aren't nice to their friends they can lose them/people may not want to be there friend anymore.

There are even wheelchair trampolines at some parks that are level with the ground. And if they aren't able to safely accommodate the child on the trampolines, there are many other activities besides jumping at trampoline parks that children and even toddlers participate in. \n\nA common misconception is that all wheelchair users are 100% disabled. Most of us are not. Some of these activities might be available to the child based on his level of ability. The mom would know that and not immediately say no without looking for a way to have their child safely included. \n\nEven if the child can't do any activities, he can go and be there and enjoy the companionship, fun, cake, and celebration with his peers.\n\nThey don't have to reschedule somewhere else.
