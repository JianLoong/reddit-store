Have the party someone else so your son and his bestie can both have fun. It\u2019s really not hard to not be ableist and not make people with disabilities feel othered.

It isn't cool seriously you might think oh it's just this one time NOPE it happens over and over again and takes it's toll.\n\nI'd suggest sitting your son and wife down and saying  I can't change the plans this late due to the tight deadline but let's call your friends parents and we will do a special day that is just for you and your best friend  something he can attend in a week or so make it a double celebration. It may seem costly but I assure you your son, his friend and the child's parents will TRULY appreciate it. My parents often had to do this for me so I didn't feel constantly left out of cool/fun events it helped ease the sting of exclusion.\n\nAlso in the FUTURE make sure never to do this again, if they remain lifelong friends go ABOVE and BEYOND to make sure future parties are inclusive to any disabilities or accessible for your son's best friend. Seriously your son and wife are amazing for wanting to include parker, you should take a lesson from them!", "YTA. You sound like you\u2019ve lost touch with reality.

You chose to diminish your own child, on his birthday, by whatever plan you thought would be a \"great idea\".\n\nBe honest, at least with yourself, it isn't about money.

That he can do better, more fun, \"greater\" things, if he leaves his best friend behind.\n\nYour son is a better human than you are. He knows that there are things that Parker can't do. He also knows that there are countless things that Parker CAN do. Your son actually sees him, and values Parker, as a person and as a friend. They share common interests.
