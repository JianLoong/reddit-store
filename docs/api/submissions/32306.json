So change your approach. Have a serious and logical conversation with your parents. Ask them if demanding you leave the bathroom was a reasonable request. If they felt it was a reasonable request, why? Being in the middle of a shower, what do they recommend you should have done; should you have stepped out soapy and covered in water so your sister could have the bathroom?

Your sister is 12, doesn't have special needs and she knows there are two other bathrooms.

What were your parents even suggesting you do? Get out of the shower, dry off, get dressed and leave the room to let her use the toilet? It would take the same amount of time for her to just walk to another toilet. Or were they expecting you to answer the door naked and wet and let her use the toilet while you're still in there?
