What a mess.\nFor you, I think NTA. If Angela was looked after financially by your father (and I'm not talking minimum child support payments) then it's a sucky situation all round but I get why your grandfather didn't include her in his will. \n\nI feel really sorry for Angela though if she was a baby trap baby and born unwanted to a manipulative gold digger and cut off from her father's family.

Then why can't you leave Angela's treatment of your grandmother in the same bin judgemental way?\nYes she's 21 and in an ideal world would  have got over it, and known better than to harass you're grandmother...

It\u2019s not even personal, if I saw this on a soap opera I\u2019d say the same thing, it just hits something deep in my bones as something so slimy I can\u2019t even describe. I will never understand how you come to the view that you\u2019re owed something from people. That\u2019s one mentality that I just will never co-sign. Not to mention, she was suing for millions. Not even an insignificant amount to make a point. She really thought she deserved to live off the money of someone who didn\u2019t want her to have what they earned. It\u2019s just a no from me. \n\nI get that you feel differently but that\u2019s just something that I can\u2019t stomach."]}
