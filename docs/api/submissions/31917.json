Because you literally did say she was but the sentence structure implies a typo. \n\n\n\nFrom what you just described, a completely consistent reading if the situation is: \"Angela's dad is a deadbeat and your grandparents didn't care and neither do you.\"\n\nLike, if the grandparents didn't know Angela, that is their fault, not hers, unless shown otherwise.", "Who cares? It was their estate to distribute for any reason. It makes them crappy people if the decision included race as a factor, but it doesn\u2019t make their derision wrong.", "There were baby trapping allegations. \n\nBut honestly I\u2019ve met her several times and she really is the most bitter, venomous person. I\u2019m not surprised they didn\u2019t immediately warm to her", "He\u2019s not with either of our mothers now", "Well she has the fault of starting it? She was 21 when she started it, it was all her choice. \n\nAngela\u2019s mother isn\u2019t his daughter. Angela and I share a father, her mother was not related to my grandparents.", "No. They weren\u2019t because we all received the money, property, and assets when my grandfather died. My grandmother only had what was explicitly hers to Will away and 90% of it was jewellery and womenswear. There were some Persian rugs and paintings/ornaments but she was an old woman she didn\u2019t go around cataloguing everything.", "I don\u2019t have that much information. \n\nMy grandparents and extended family thought she baby trapped my dad, my dad and her weren\u2019t in a relationship but she thought she was owed a continued relationship with the family and they disagreed. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. \n\nI don\u2019t know how involved my dad was in her life, my dad had partial custody of me but between my dad splitting his time between countries and my being at boarding school, my custody arrangement didn\u2019t often intersect with hers.", "Yes, he\u2019s alive. He\u2019s how she even knows about my grandmother dying and me having the stuff. He asked for a sculpture my grandma had and I gave it to him and I guess she was at his house and asked where he got it and he told her. And then she contacted me.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t in my grandfather\u2019s Will, sorry I thought that was clear since she sued the estate. \n\nI don\u2019t know how involved my dad is in Angela\u2019s life, I can\u2019t say whether he\u2019s a deadbeat or not or whether she considers him one", "Understood, but then why didn't your father protect Angela from your grand dad's disdain? Angela was as much his daughter as you are. Not trying to blame him, just getting more understanding.", "So then you are making the decision on who is worthy to inherit her property. Would it hurt you to let your sister have one thing?", "Unless I'm misreading this, it sounds like your grandparents had no interest in their other granddaughter from the time she was born. That's very sad.", "So your family wanted to abandon Angela, and she wasn\u2019t happy with that?\n\nRegardless of is she was a trapper. Your dad got trapped. He chose to sleep with her. She isn\u2019t crazy for questioning how these people would treat her especially given your dad\u2019s choice not to defend her child, a few times in this post alone.\n\nYTA - and lacking real empathy if you cannot see how cruel and disgusting the actions of your family have been and are toward her.\n\nYou say she was old enough to know at 21, well you\u2019re 26 with a fully formed brain yet are willing to continue this campaign of cruelty no questions asked, with no info.", "Okay, so here's how this reads to me: your father is a deadbeat who had no interest in your half sister. The fact that you dont know if he's in her life either means you don't care or he doesn't care. Your grandparents didn't like having a bastard granddaughter and left her out of the will, so her mother advocated for your 21 year old sister's rights in court and lost. She got nothing and your family got everything. Meanwhile you were 20, surrounded by people who were calling her greedy so you believed them, maybe not without question but you're not really showing any interest here so it seems like it was without question. \n\nNow you're calling her greedy when she was disowned for a bad reason, while she's upset with you for perpetuating the abandonment that she experienced from your father and his family. YTA.", "There was no protecting to be done. As I said, she very rarely saw them. Once very few years if I remember right. \n\nNo one was ever rude to her when she was around she just very seldom was", "Why does the sister deserve anything after how does behaved.", "Uh\u2026no. My family didn\u2019t want contact with her *mother*, that\u2019s what I meant. This was during her pregnancy and after Angela was born. \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t offer her possessions from a woman she bullied into a hospital bed I\u2019m cruel? That\u2019s fair enough I guess, since I asked for opinions. \n\nAs I said, I\u2019m open to offering something from my grandmother\u2019s things, I still just feel off about it", "I don\u2019t know because he and I aren\u2019t close and don\u2019t talk about her. He was in her life as a kid I know that because I saw her occasionally but I didn\u2019t see him much, as I went to boarding school and he split his time between different locations. No, I don\u2019t care whether he\u2019s in her life, it\u2019s not my business. \n\nNo, it\u2019s not about believing them. I think if someone doesn\u2019t want to give you something, that\u2019s that on that. Too bad if you don\u2019t agree with it, you don\u2019t have to, because it *isn\u2019t yours and you are not entitled to it*. To know someone didn\u2019t want you to have something you aren\u2019t entitled to in the first place, and then start a legal battle to get it anyway, and go so far as to send harassing, abusive texts to that person\u2019s grieving widow even when she is in ill health\u2026greedy isn\u2019t the word but it\u2019s the only one I\u2019m comfortable typing. It\u2019s wrong, in my opinion. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t speak to her. That behaviour does not sit well with me. \n\nThat said, I am open to the fact that since my grandmother was also hers, I perhaps should have reached out through my dad and offered her something.\n\nBut I stand by not speaking to her over the way she behaved with that joke of a lawsuit.", "Ah. So she\u2019s completely cut off from her father\u2019s family and has been her whole life. \n\nThe child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth. \n\nAngela knows, without question, her entire father\u2019s family never has and never will care about her. Your grandfather cut her out of his will, couldn\u2019t be bothered to give her a gesture of \u201csorry your mom sucks, wish things could\u2019ve been different\u201d.\n\nYour dad is the asshole. He allowed this entire sad story to happen. I\u2019ve seen this story play out in my own extended family. The kid\u2019s mom is a nightmare of a human being that turns every attempt to see the child into a horrible, screaming, nightmare scene, purposely tries to ice out the father and father\u2019s family, and then everyone gives up because they don\u2019t have the energy to fight crazy. The child fades away.\n\nYour dad should\u2019ve fought for her anyway. Because I bet her mother would\u2019ve have been able to convince her to sue if she had a real relationship with her grandparents. Your dad\u2019s failure to manage this when Angela was a child came back to bite him, and his whole family, in the ass.", "But your father is her father. Why was her relationship with them not as important as yours?\n\nThis seems like odd, and frankly cruel, behavior from everyone in the family toward her.\n\n**And considering the age difference, there a tons of unanswered questions around why everyone is conducting themselves this way.**\n\nHowever, the center of responsibility if your father.", "Yeah, I think there is missing info. Was your dad in her life? Did he not bring her around them when he had custody? I do believe Angela feels no loss at not having a relationship with the grandparents, but something seems off.", "The sister may have been manipulated by her mother. The sister didn\u2019t get a chance to make amends.", "It\u2019s so funny that you framed this is Angela being the bully when your entire family has spent their time, intentionally trying to hurt a child, because that\u2019s what Angela was in comparison to them.\n\nYou would not feel the way you do if you\u2019d lived your life in Angela\u2019s shoes, with her extended family letting adult issues keep her separate.", "We all live in different countries and either my dad didn\u2019t have custody or her mother wouldn\u2019t let her travel, I don\u2019t know what happened there tbh. That\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t around much at family gatherings", "He was in her life but lived in a different country to my grandparents and didn\u2019t travel with her so she\u2019d see them when they came to the country which wasn\u2019t often.", "In 6 years? It sounds like she didn't even try.", "I really hope, regardless of how much contact I\u2019d had with my grandparents, that I wouldn\u2019t have been raised by someone who raised me to think I was entitled to things someone didn\u2019t want to give me. I was lucky I wasn\u2019t.", "It very simple to put it all on your sisters mom.\n\nBut you\u2019re willfully ignoring that your father has 2 children so close in age, and will happily let one go with less and advocate for her in any capacity.\n\nYTA - and so is your family overall. I\u2019m sure at this point, Sarah gets it. *\u2019She\u2019s not part of the family! No one cares about her! Her mom sucks and by extension her too!\u2019* But my goodness I cannot imagine being her. And having my own family disinherit me, blame me for being upset, then further hammer home just how not a part of the family I am.", "You didn\u2019t notice the part where OP said her family (except her dad) stopped communicating with the sister? Maybe they didn\u2019t give her a chance.", "Go with less what? Money from my grandfather? My dad didn\u2019t write or even know what was in my grandfather\u2019s Will and it wasn\u2019t his money to give out in the first place.\n\nI do not have enough information to be placing blame on anyone for her not being around, and I didn\u2019t say that. But logically, that\u2019s the conclusion I\u2019ve come to. \n\nI do blame her for starting the legal battle, I freely admit that. You are *never* entitled to what someone else has. They owe you nothing. So for someone to deliberately not give you something and you feel so entitled to it, regardless of how that deceased person felt, that you harass their grieving widow, you have to be a special kind of snake in my book. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t speak to Angela now.", "If my grandmother was sued by someone after losing my grandfather, I'd cut them off too."]}
