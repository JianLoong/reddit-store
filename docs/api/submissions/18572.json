I am like no, I paid for her seat please sit in your own seat, my daughter is quiet and then the lady turns to my daughter and is like \"you don't mind sweetie that I have the arm rest down right?\" My daughter is just quiet at this point and looks down.  \n\n\nI say, \"Please I don't want to make a scene but please give my daughter her seat.\" She says, \"I am barely taking any of her seat and to mind my own business.\" I then get the flight attendant to come and the flight attendant then asks the lady to put down the arm rest, and at this point other people are looking and I think that makes the lady extra irritable.

And based on the neighbor's reaction, that lady would not have listened to the kid either. So good for you for standing up to your daughter.", "NTA. I don't care how this sounds...If you take up more than 1 seat then pay for 2. I do not want to be pressed into someone or have a stranger touching me because they can't fit into the seat. Not my problem.", "NTA. \n\nI am overweight and I am extremely conscious of the space I occupy on an airplane and try very hard not to make people feel uncomfortable.

This woman was a stranger, infringing on a child's personal space. Not ok.\n\nCould you have approached it differently? Sure, but... kids are not always the best about saying no to a pushy adult. Your daughter likely didn't want to cause a fuss, but was also uncomfortable. \n\nJust a random redditor's opinion, but I think this is a good opportunity to teach your daughter about boundaries and personal space, even with adults. That if she's uncomfortable, she can say so or come to you. \n\nThe reason I mention this, is I ended up in an ugly situation with my 5th grade teacher. He wasn't a creep or anything, but did some iffy stuff. Mostly openly ranking us by our perceived intelligence and junk like that. Thing is... he told us not to tell our parents. I was caught in the situation of defying one authority figure to do the 'right' thing and tell my mom. I was the only one who said anything about his antics, cuz the other kids were taught not to speak against an adult... even if they were wrong.", "NTA\n\nEven a child deserves to be comfortable on a seat that was full-price.", "An adult asking an eight year old for permission.

I felt like I was cuddling with the woman on the whole flight. I told the attendant that we didn't fit (bc the lady in the middle didn't fit in one seat) and he shrugged. The plane was full so nothing to be done really. But it was awful. Her thighs were pressed into me the whole time and she had long hair that she was combing her fingers through right onto my lap! People are awful when they fly and will take advantage of a little girl. Good for you for standing up for her. It's not ideal that she cried, but she didn't understand why the adult was acting like that. Children expect adults to behave properly and they trust adults. For her, the woman getting upset was stressful because it didn't make sense to her experience of adults behaving properly. Just remind her that you always have her best interests in mind and will do your best to stick up for her whenever you can.", "Nta\n\nI would have been upset. Airplanes are notorious for being uncomfortable in the best of situations. \n\n\nYour daughter is a child and needed someone to stand up her.

If the FA doesn't, ask for the \"lead\" or the \"purser,\" and, if necessary, the pilot.  If the FA tells you to talk to a gate agent, DO NOT GET OFF THE PLANE.\n\nYou are neither rude nor discourteous for insisting on the full use of your seat.", "It's about boundaries and consent. If someone wants permission to raise the armrest because they don't fit well, as an adult you can say yes or no. An eight-year-old can't, not really. She should have her space.\n\nIt's unfortunate that airlines choose profit over people, but your daughter has a right to her seat. You did the right thing OP; NTA. \n\n(As far as space goes, a coach seat on a plane has just about enough room for an eight-year-old.)", "NTA - spilling into someone else's seat is literally stealing. You're taking their space they paid for and you didn't. So they get less than they paid for and the large person just steals it because they feel entitled (sorry to any larger people but literally that's what it is). If you can't fit in a plane seat - and they aren't actually that small! - then buy two tickets and if that's expensive well flying isn't a right. Lots of people can't afford it.", "The real AH here is airplane companies making chairs my skinny ass can\u2019t fit into, let alone someone bigger, but definitely NTA for advocating for your child.", "NTA but for the future you gotta do better to make sure your daughter isn\u2019t sitting alone.

If you can\u2019t fit in a seat comfortably, you gotta buy two. It sucks, but that\u2019s the way it is. You shouldn\u2019t take up someone else\u2019s seat that they paid for.", "Esh.\n\nI feel like he is exaggerating this woman\u2019s size. Taking 40% I highly doubt as the woman was still able to fit with the armrests down. \n\nYour response made your daughter cry.\n\nBut once he asked she should have put the armrest down.\n\nPlus going on about I paid for her comfort. Blah blah. Didn\u2019t pay enough to sit together though?", "Info: what did your daughter say about it afterwards?

You tried to \"help\" and she wound up crying, and the unhappy focus of an unpleasant scene.   \n\nNext time, maybe make up an excuse, and trade seats with your daughter for a while.  Then you can set that boundary without making her the focus of so much unpleasant attention.", "YTA.  Because you wanted your daughter to be comfortable, you made her cry?  Mission was not accomplished.  Sure, she was kind of squashed, which is uncomfortable, but being in the middle of a big argument between adults is much worse.  It's scary and embarrassing.  You knew as soon as she was looking down that she was uncomfortable with the whole argument.  Why didn't you back off then?  If you did care so much about her comfort, why didn't you switch seats with her?  You'd have been squashed, but she would have room.
