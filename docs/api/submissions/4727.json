My sister is a lesbian and dated my gf for 8 months in high school. My girlfriend says she was young and is now no longer into woman, which she realized while dating my sister resulting in their breakup. \n  Well Cynthia and I met through my job and hit it off immediately. I moved in with her at 7 months and we got a dog together. My sister Mallory, never really gave any input on this relationship but I assumed she didn\u2019t care because she is now engaged. We saw each other at family events and she was always friendly. \n\nCynthia recently just gave birth to our baby. My sister and I have always been close, it\u2019s just us two, so I named my daughter after my sister. Plus Mallory is a beautiful name.\n\nWell I made a Facebook post about welcoming Mallory Lynn into the world and within minutes I got a call from my sister livid. She was yelling and saying how dare I name her niece after her when she already has to live with me being with her first love. This \u201cfirst love\u201d part was news to me bc they were only 16. Sophomores in highschool. I told her I did it bc I love and respect her so much and it wasn\u2019t meant to be a negative thing. She called me an AH and said I just broke her heart all over again. I\u2019m considering changing the baby\u2019s name (she\u2019s only 2 weeks old) but I rly don\u2019t want too. I love my sister and wanted my daughter to be named after her.

My girlfriend says she was young and is now no longer into woman, which she realized while dating my sister resulting in their breakup. \n  Well Cynthia and I met through my job and hit it off immediately. I moved in with her at 7 months and we got a dog together. My sister Mallory, never really gave any input on this relationship but I assumed she didn\u2019t care because she is now engaged. We saw each other at family events and she was always friendly. \n\nCynthia recently just gave birth to our baby. My sister and I have always been close, it\u2019s just us two, so I named my daughter after my sister. Plus Mallory is a beautiful name.\n\nWell I made a Facebook post about welcoming Mallory into the world and within minutes I got a call from my sister livid. She was yelling and saying how dare I name her niece after her when she already has to live with me being with her first love. This \u201cfirst love\u201d part was news to me bc they were only 16. Sophomores in highschool. I told her I did it bc I love and respect her so much and it wasn\u2019t meant to be a negative thing. She called me an AH and said I just broke her heart all over again. I\u2019m considering changing the baby\u2019s name (she\u2019s only 2 weeks old) but I rly don\u2019t want too.
