My sister is a lesbian and dated my gf for 8 months in high school. My girlfriend says she was young and is now no longer into woman, which she realized while dating my sister resulting in their breakup. \n  Well Cynthia and I met through my job and hit it off immediately. I moved in with her at 7 months and we got a dog together. My sister Mallory, never really gave any input on this relationship but I assumed she didn\u2019t care because she is now engaged. We saw each other at family events and she was always friendly. \n\nCynthia recently just gave birth to our baby. My sister and I have always been close, it\u2019s just us two, so I named my daughter after my sister. Plus Mallory is a beautiful name.\n\nWell I made a Facebook post about welcoming Mallory Lynn into the world and within minutes I got a call from my sister livid. She was yelling and saying how dare I name her niece after her when she already has to live with me being with her first love. This \u201cfirst love\u201d part was news to me bc they were only 16. Sophomores in highschool. I told her I did it bc I love and respect her so much and it wasn\u2019t meant to be a negative thing. She called me an AH and said I just broke her heart all over again. I\u2019m considering changing the baby\u2019s name (she\u2019s only 2 weeks old) but I rly don\u2019t want too. I love my sister and wanted my daughter to be named after her.

My sister is a lesbian and dated my gf for 8 months in high school. My girlfriend says she was young and is now no longer into woman, which she realized while dating my sister resulting in their breakup. \n  Well Cynthia and I met through my job and hit it off immediately. I moved in with her at 7 months and we got a dog together. My sister Mallory, never really gave any input on this relationship but I assumed she didn\u2019t care because she is now engaged. We saw each other at family events and she was always friendly. \n\nCynthia recently just gave birth to our baby. My sister and I have always been close, it\u2019s just us two, so I named my daughter after my sister. Plus Mallory is a beautiful name.\n\nWell I made a Facebook post about welcoming Mallory into the world and within minutes I got a call from my sister livid. She was yelling and saying how dare I name her niece after her when she already has to live with me being with her first love. This \u201cfirst love\u201d part was news to me bc they were only 16. Sophomores in highschool. I told her I did it bc I love and respect her so much and it wasn\u2019t meant to be a negative thing. She called me an AH and said I just broke her heart all over again. I\u2019m considering changing the baby\u2019s name (she\u2019s only 2 weeks old) but I rly don\u2019t want too. I love myself and wanted my daughter to be named after her. \nAita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No. They're not the same thing", "That they CAN was never in question; it's obvious that they are able and allowed to name their kid anything under the sun.

The same for me, if I had feeling for my siblings' exes, I wouldn't do anything till I clarified it with them, no matter how long ago they dated.

As for the names, nicknames, and birthday, that's....not what OP did. It sounds strictly like first name.

I'll look at the some other stuff to sate my own curiosity, but it does appear I'm in the minority on this one. I'm fortunate that I've never had to worry about a situation like this", "Well, if my sister would give her kid my name and I would be informed about that via a Facebook post, I would call her an idiot. \n\nSo siblings react are different.

And you're right that considering how close OP seems to think he is with his sister, her reactions suggest that he's more disconnected than he realizes", "I do wonder if there's more than OP is telling us, or if he really just doesn't really understand the truth about his relationship with is sister. Reading what other people point out in their comments, OP seems to not have an accurate read on his relationship with his sister, perhaps mistaking \"not directly being told she was unhappy with something\" with \"she's okay with it\"", "Yeah, to me the biggest difference is the time between OP's sis and OP dating her and that it was a relationship rather than a hookup, but either way, I completely get your point.  All of it should've been talked about much earlier than after having a kid with GF and naming her after sis."]}
