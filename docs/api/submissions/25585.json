I asked her what was wrong, but she said nothing. Later that day, she directly asked me and my wife (38) if her pregnancy was planned. Later, she told me that,while she was talking to their friend about their parents and for the first time she actually thought about mine and her mother's age disparity and one of her friends semijokingly called her an accident. Before my wife could say anything, I told her the truth: I was a freshman in university who got drunk at a party and lost my virginity with her mother (I didn't actually told her that part), and she was an accident. She went back to crying and apologising, and her mother is not pleased with me.\n\nI honestly don't get the issue. As I explained both to my wife and my daughter, I was also an accident, a fact which my parents never tried to hide, and this was never a problem to me nor to them. They were the best, most loving parents I could've asked for, and so were my grandparents, even my grandmother who suggested I should be aborted cared for me deeply. I can't see how being planned or not is a problem if we chose to keep, raise and love her anyway.\n\nI wanted a daughter at some point anyway, so I wouldn't call her fully unplanned. Sure, I didn't plan to become a father at 17 but hey, you can't control those things. I guess I could actually, but I don't regret anything, I love my daughter more than anything in the world, and would die for her. She said she feels as if my life would be better without her, so I explained to her why I disagreed and she seems a bit better, but my wife is still mad at me.\n\nHer brother was unplanned, and her and his other siblings have used this to make him feel lesser. My wife is convinced that a child being planned or not is important in whether their parents will love them, which honestly made me feel a little bad, because I never had actually given any thought, certainly not negative thoughts, to the fact that I wasn't planned. Also, I think being dishonest with our daughter would be far worse. I told my wife she was planned but her parents still don't love her and she got very mad. To be clear, I know that I shouldn't have said that, it was the first thing that came to my mind and I didn't notice it sounds pretty offensive until after I spoke, so you don't need to point out I'm an asshole for this one.\n\nShould I've lied?

There is a difference between being planned and being wanted. Plenty of parents planned on having kids and end up regretting it later. While your daughter was unplanned, she was definitely wanted by your description.", "17 and 24, I was honestly expecting a lot more comments discussing that.", "My mom told me I was a \"surprise\". I connected those dots real quick.", "NTA. Don't lie to your kids. Saying it was an accident probably doesn't put it in a good light. I'd recommend \"not planned\" as you've used. Hell I'm adopted from teenage parents I was a decision away from a coat hanger", "Info: When you say \u201cher brother was unplanned, and her and his other siblings have used this to make him feel lesser,\u201d does \u201cher\u201d mean your daughter or your wife? Has your daughter been teasing a sibling, or has your wife been teasing your brother-in-law? Has your daughter spent her childhood hearing her mother mock her uncle as less lovable because he was unplanned?\n\nI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s been taught, but when I was growing up there was so much emphasis on \u201cif you get pregnant, your life is over.\u201d My husband and I had my very wanted, very planned kid in my late 30s and there was still a teenaged corner of my lizard brain whispering that to me. So your daughter might be thinking \u201can unplanned pregnancy would ruin my life, so I ruined my parents\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nAlso, your daughter might be aware of a consent issue. When I was a teenage girl, if you were drunk and got pregnant, you\u2019d \u201cjust\u201d be slut-shamed. But now many people have a more evolved understanding of consent. Like if you were drunk at her conception, even if you were 100% on board with the sex you were having, technically you weren\u2019t capable of consent. Your daughter might be processing that concept. I\u2019m not accusing anybody of anything, and I\u2019m not telling you how to feel about it. But she might think, \u201cif that happened to me it could be considered sexual assault, and it happened between my parents.\u201d\n\nNTA for telling her the truth, but now I would spend a lot of time teasing out the nuances of her reaction and reassuring her as much as possible.", "Nah - I can see how a teenager can take it the wrong way given what everyone tells them about how horrible an unplanned pregnancy would be. However, it doesn't really mean the same as being unwanted or unloved. I'm with you, I wouldn't think to hide it. But I can see why it would upset her.", "NTA she was unplanned that\u2019s what it\u2019s called if you get somebody pregnant and it wasn\u2019t planned", "I think the tone makes the music.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t tell your kid they were an accident, a mistake, or an oopsie.  If asked, you and your partner weren\u2019t actively trying for a baby; they were a happy surprise or most welcomed surprise.", "YTA\n\nMy mom told me had she realized she was pregnant sooner, I wouldn't be here   it was..... Hurtful", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t planned. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not wanted or loved. Those things aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. \n\nMany times, the best things in life are unplanned.", "I mean...your wording wasn't fantastic. \"You weren't planned, but you were wanted\" is honest and reassures her that you don't view her as a mistake. N T A for telling the truth, but a slight YTA for the wording. She's 14 and worried that she isn't wanted; just reassure her that you love her.", "I think people are overreacting about the age gap. He said he was in college at 17 so he must have started early. She, at 24, is college student age. It probably didn\u2019t occur to her that a fellow college student was a minor.", "YTA, I get where you're coming from and you had 100% good intentions, I do believe it was your place to eventually tell her if she enquired about it but I do feel 14 is too young to tell given how difficult it is for those of emotional immaturity to grasp for which teenagers often surely lack. I would've waited until at least her 20s and only told her if she asked. \n\nI get your intentions though. I spoke to my mother a few years ago on my birthday regarding the situation of my birth, she explained in a way that never called me an accident but I got the impression I was; given she said \"It was a one night stand situation with your father\" As during that time, they had a falling out and were in the process of seperating as there were issues in the marriage. Granted though, I was informed when I at least was in my 20s, I had the emotional maturity to accept that. \n\nThe terminology of \"accident\" implies of a negative way, suggesting of a mistake. I think thats the issue many have with having their birth be referred to it as such. Because everyone in some degree, wants to be loved and planned and not seen as some wrong mistake. The thing to realize that deals with those having this issue is that, being an accident doesnt mean unwanted and also, a lot of situations for which a couple meets each other and later has a family, are all purely accidential whether it be meeting each other at a party or introducing to friends or ending upn in the same class. A lot of variables in life are purely coincidental and once you accept the idea that things often are a result of fate, it becomes easier to grasp.", "NAH - lying to your kid is never good because it will get out eventually.  Your daughter is naturally sensitive on the subject, especially if she's being bullied by other kids.\n\nMaybe sitting down with your daughter and explaining how happy you are to be her father and how lucky you got to have been given such an amazing kid.  Ask her to imagine if she got pregnant at 17 by accident - would she love the child less than if it had been planned?\n\nThe fact that you're married to her mother and not a deadbeat that she sees one weekend a month shows that you wanted to be in her life.", "NTA lying would only make it worse.\n\nYTA because of the way you handled it.\n\nBetter way to say it was, you were unplanned but not unwanted, and I have never regretted you being a part of my life.", "YTA - She was crying because she thought she was an \"accident\". Accident implies something that's unfortunate and negative.\n\nI think this is a clear indication that what she needed was reassurance that she was and is *wanted*. Because that's going to be what's bothering her.\n\nYou don't need to lie but accident has quite a specific meaning. And telling her you were drunk is something she never needed to know.\n\nIt didn't bother you but she is not you and I think a bit of sensitivity and reading the room wouldn't have gone amiss.", ">I honestly don't get the issue.\n\nYour own words spell it out. Your daughter's friends teased her about her parentage, and there is a nagging belief that unplanned means unwanted. More to the point teens that age take things a little more seriously than adults do.\n\nSince you didn't know the full backstory behind your daughter's question when she asked, I do not fault you for giving a direct answer.\n\nHowever I do NOT think you should have told her you were drunk at the time.\n\nI'll give you a pass, though.

You need to read the room.\n\nWhile it's too late, the best answer without lying would have probably been: *It doesn't matter*.", "YTA for how you worded it, not for the fact she wasn't planned.\n\nWhat would have been better to say was that she was a \"surprise\", not planned but also not an accident and very much loved and wanted.", "YTA - What you are saying to your daughter even though you may not have meant it that way is that she was a mistake and shouldn't ever been born.  That would be devastating to any normal person at that age or any age really.  Should have said instead that she joyous surprise and let it go at that.  The way you said it was cruel.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s a story as old as time and, as others have pointed out, unplanned is one thing, unwanted would be a very sad story.

Your delivery might be a little rough but children deserve to know the truth. Our boys are still young but we make sure they know how easy it is for an unplanned pregnancy to happen so they can, hopefully, make the right choices.", "She was crying because someone convinced her that being an accident = being unwanted. You're not the asshole for telling her the truth, YTA for not recognizing that hearing that she was an accident was going to be received as a BAD thing. I don't know how much more clear it could have been that you were not supposed to just blurt out \"yes, and also I was drunk at the time and just trying to party!\" You poured water on a grease fire.", " NTA, but like are we not talking about the wife being pissed because karma came and dumped on hrr house. her daughter is getting mad about the very thing the wife used to bully her brother with. Dad is not the problem he doesnt love his daughter and less but im really questioning if shes picking up her moms feelings. that feeling of your life would be better with out me isnt coming out of the discussion with friends", "YTA\n\nit's good you didn't lie to your daughter but \"accident\" is a very loaded term. she came into the car crying that she was teased about being an \"accident\" (\"you shouldn't have been born\") and you used the same language to reaffirm what she was already devastated about. you could have handled your explanation much more delicately. just because something doesn't bother you, doesn't mean it won't bother someone else.", "NTA. My brother's an accident. Dad suggested an abortion, but he was well-loved by everyone. Just because a kid is unplanned doesn't mean s/he's unloved. Just try and reaffirm that to her.", "NTA but your wife is a AH. She and her siblings bullied her brother for being unplanned so worried about what she has said to your daughter. You gave her the truth, you conceived her at a party at a time you weren't much older than she is now. Is she going through school sex ed at the moment or being lectured about not ruining her life with early sex? Something sparked the conversation. Try and sit down and talk it out. She needs to know that she is loved and that though teen pregnancies aren't great as I suspect she is being told, stepping up to be a parent young didn't ruin your life.", "My sister was 4 months old when my mom found out she was pregnant with me. I was 10ish when this happened she told me that. The first thing I asked was why she didn\u2019t get an abortion (I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t! I love my life), but dude, that sucks. She said she always wanted two and didn\u2019t consider it, and that was that. I don\u2019t think he op did anything wrong. \n\nI think the daughter is going to realize some uncomfortable facts and op handled it well. NTA", "Nope. Also there is never a accident baby. You got in bed with your wife. Not an accident", "Hey great, you are honest with your kid. Two: I'm more creeped out from some of these comments, that you had sex with a person of legal age of consent, and they are ripping on you.\n\nOP is asking a legit question for help and ya'll are ripping OP apart over age gap. Get over it. People who are younger and older have sex.\n\n98 year olds have sex. Under 18 year olds have sex.\n\nIt's sad to see these comments. We are the human species, How do you think you were born? (unless youre a bot)\n\nAlso OP yes your kid was not an \"accident\" it happens and unplanned pregnancies should not be shunned. Good for you to be there for your partner and discuss the matter with your kid, (like a true adult) and not be an ass like other people, who get someone pregnant and ditch.\n\nSo the term \"accident\" has another stigma, however, like other commenters, if you frame it as something positive like \"surprise\" or whatever, it comes off better.\n\nPerhaps her \"friend\" has some insecurities to make her feel bad that she was born and that should be questioned?\n\nFor a kid to not know their parents had sex for them to be created, is idk weird.\n\nPerhaps Santa Claus, Easter bunny and tooth fairy are real?

Again, accident and mistake are not the same thing. It sounds like your daughter feels a little bit like she\u2019s a mistake, and I would focus on reinforcing that this just isn\u2019t true. It sounds like you love her very much. \n\n\nAlso, what does this say about your wife\u2019s feelings towards your daughter that she thinks that whether or not a pregnancy is planned will impact how the parents love the child??? That\u2019s some messed up thinking right there. Does she love and treat your daughter like a beloved child? Does she secretly resent her? \n\n\nIt sounds like you have some further conversations to be had in the coming days.", "Lmfao i feel like i can vouch for that lol it took me an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond when you find out why Maira coddled Robert so much. Idk what it just sparked in me cuz I realized I was planned. My cousins and most of my friends who had unplanned pregnancies were all loving and grew up very nurturing. Mine however? One of my earliest memories is asking my mom for a bite of her sandwich and she threw it away just so I couldn\u2019t have it. I thought about the nepotism between my sister and I and it just clicked. My aunt verified that my mom had me on purpose so she can get married with parents permission and leave my grandma\u2019s house. \n\nShe was a teen mom and my sister was the accident and she attempted to abort her by starving herself hoping she\u2019d miscarry. Guess between us got the better treatment? She did plan for my brothers but it felt like meh and I got parentifed. It just felt she liked being pregnant and the attention once the baby be born I pretty took care of them. I was feeling pretty suicidal at age 13 cuz I felt like a teen mom. As for me? I\u2019m currently pregnant I think I would love my child accident or planned I just know I love my now bigger bean (size of Lego I guess currently 11 weeks :3) sorry for the life story just wanna say you\u2019re not wrong lol", "My first pregnancy was unplanned. (I was 17 & still in high school). I\u2019ve always said that she was unplanned but not u wanted.", "I used to watch Roseanne all the time and one time DJ asked if he was an accident and Roaeanne says he was a surprise and he asks what the difference is.\n\nDan says an accident is something that if you had to do again, you wouldn't but a surprise is something you didn't even know you wanted until you got it.\n\nIdk, just always thought it was a nice way to put it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "but thats a way better way to put it that the child was a surprise and a good one :)", "Agreed! And well said", "He never said his daughter was unwanted, he said unplanned", "But he did say that.\n\n>As I explained both to my wife and my daughter, I was also an accident, a fact which my parents never tried to hide, and this was never a problem to me nor to them. They were the best, most loving parents I could've asked for, and so were my grandparents, even my grandmother who suggested I should be aborted cared for me deeply.", "There are 2 definitions for the word accident.\n\nThe first, as you have suggested has negative connotations to it:\n\n\"An unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury\"\n\nThe second is literally just talking about circumstances being unplanned. Neither good nor bad.\n\n\"An event that happens by chance or that is without apparent or deliberate cause.\"\n\nAs Bob Ross would often say when making unintentional marks on his paintings \"you know we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents. we just have happy accidents\"\n\nJust because something or someone is unplanned, doesn't mean it's a bad thing that it happened.", "> I was a freshman in university who got drunk at a party and lost my virginity with her mother (I didn't actually told her that part)\n\nHe specifically said that he didn't tell her that part.", "reddit gets really hung up on wording sometimes. unplanned is the correct term to use. as you cant really be surprised that sex would lead to a baby you have sex knowing that's an outcome no matter how safe you where.\n\nEdit SPAG", "Exactly.  This was a horrible delivery.  You were a happy surprise that brought us together.  Bam, same information, delivered with a positive spin.", "This is also no delicate, naive little girl since she uses the knowledge that her brother was unplanned against him to make him feel lesser. She\u2019s just using teenage nonsense to make her life seem dramatic.", "I disagree. The post presents that her daughter asked first, he answered, and \"later\" she told him her friend called her an accident.", "My thoughts exactly. Freaking creepy!", "Also I\u2019m inferring from this the mom *planned* their daughter (otherwise she wouldn\u2019t love her) so \u2026. What was the plan lady? Find a drunk college kid?", "Hmmm I don\u2019t think many 14yos think about age gaps. When I was 14 I thought I\u2019d be super mature at 17 and cool enough to date a 24yo (I never did). I was an idiot, absolutely, but many teenagers are.", "He says 17 in the post.", "When i was 17/18 i \u201ctalked\u201d with my assistant teacher aid whatever, she was 24. This exact scenario almost. We never fucked or anything, but we texted and went on dates. At the time i was like \u201cthis is awesome\u201d but the older I\u2019ve gotten the more fucked up it is to me. That was a teacher taking advantage of a student. It\u2019s just since it was me i just didn\u2019t think of it that way. Maybe too young at the time to see it as i do now. Creepy as fucking hell. She was always giving me looks in class and would sit there and text me all day. But yeah. At the time I thought i was cool, now i think \u201cwow that was actually kinda creepy to prey on your underage students\u201d", "No that's a story for right now. Please", "My son was an unplanned third pregnancy, but certainly never unwanted. We call him our surprise baby.

The first is the closest to \u201cplanned\u201d except that I had decided to stop trying when I found out I was pregnant. Our second is an Irish twin and I assume our third was sent by someone up above as the math doesn\u2019t math with him but here he is.", "The all time best sitcom dad, Dan Connor.", "That\u2019s the point. His daughter is upset because unplanned means unwanted. He needed to emphasize that she was wanted in spite of being unplanned.", "No he didn't, he talked about himself, telling her he was also an accident.  That clearly didn't help.  He should have talked about his daughter.", "He said way too much.", "But if someone is already crying because their peers told them they were an \"accident\", using that same word is unlikely to bring them comfort.\n\nEspecially following it up by telling your 14 year old kid that you were drunk when they were conceived.", "No, you are leaving out an important part of the quote.\n\n>I told her the truth: I was a freshman in university who got drunk at a party and lost my virginity with her mother (I didn't actually told her that part), and she was an accident.\n\nIn an out of order way, this is stating that he told her:  \n\\--he was a freshman at a university  \n\\--who got drunk at a party  \n\\--she was an accident\n\nAnd that he didn't tell her:\n\n\\--he lost his virginity with her mother\n\nI do not find credible *from what is written* any reading that he left out more than one thing, or that the thing he left out was anything other than the fact immediately preceding \"I didn't actually told her that part\". It might be pleasing to think your version is what he said to his daughter, but that is not what the OP actually wrote.", "That's what the mother, OP's wife, did. Not the daughter.", "But his son wasn\u2019t planned and mom is basically admitting to not loving him. \n\nJust read it again, maybe it was OPs wife\u2019s brother that wasn\u2019t planned.", "My kid has been discussing it since they started high school and saw all the seniors who would be creepy with freshmen.", "I mean, I get it and that's cool hearing your perspective, but from my perspective, it would have been different for me. I was 6'2 and about two fifteen and looked older than seventeen. I personally think I would have been just fine. \nOf course, that's just me, and i'm sorry that it brings up potential trauma for you.", "nope it does not or they wouldn't be 2 separate words.

In my pocket there's some cash, that's unplanned but it is wanted.", "I want to make sure I understand your argument correctly.\n\nYou believe the OP telling his daughter \"wanted does not mean unplanned, because I was not\" was insufficient enough for him to be TA because he did not say the word \"you\".", "I don't think he had much of an alternative, given the fact that she had just realized that he would have been 17 when she was conceived. He couldn't keep the accident part at least a secret. She's old enough that he wouldn't want to be giving her the impression that planning a pregnancy at 17 is reasonable.\n\nShe's going to have some feelings about this, but I think telling her was probably the best thing to do.", "Right.\n\nBut OP admitted he just wasn't necessarily prepared at that age and still committed to parenthood. Even stating he wanted a kid when he was ready.\n\nThe accident wasn't that it happened.
