I've had body dysmorphia for a very long time, and have struggled with my body a lot. I've gotten over it, but sometimes it comes back and I'll find myself saying 'Wow I look so fat' or whatever. Being a girl is awesome.\n\nGrowing up, I've always had the same best friend. We'll call her Becky. Becky and I were best friends throughout grade school up until University. She wasn't fat, but she was a little bigger than me. It wasn't noticeable to me, but I guess it was to her. We were like two peas in a pod all throughout school. When we were apart, people would always ask where the other one was. We were known for being together all the time. \n\nI love Becky. She has always been there for me through thick and thin and we tell each other everything. The only problem was, I tended to be in relationships/dating all the time while Becky did not. She didn't really ever put herself out there, but always felt a little insecure around me. I never understood that, since she was so much funnier than me and was genuinely the best person to be around. \n\nThis past week, we got into a minor fight about me not spending time with her because I got into a new relationship with someone I met at university. This was granted and I apologized for my wrongdoings. She went on a bit of a side tangent and told me how insecure she felt with me, and how I actually gave her an ED. She said I constantly made her feel like shit and she couldn't stand to be around me anymore.\n\nI feel awful. I knew she had issues with her body like I did, but I didn't think I was the cause. I guess I could be the cause since all I do is talk about 'Oh I look fat in this' or 'Oh I look so fat right now', and she ended up comparing how I viewed myself to how I viewed her. \n\nShe hasn't talked to me since. She told me she does not want to continue our friendship because of this.

Body talk is sensitive for everyone so she was definitely wrong to hurl this at you as an insult in a fight.\n\nPlease take care of yourself as it sounds like you have a lot of negative self-talk to deal with. But also be aware that issues with your body stop being internal when you are constantly externalizing very harmful thoughts.\n\nI lost a long time friend because her ED start bleeding over into my behaviors and food being commented on.

Talking about how fat you are or how fat you look is toxic for anyone, and since she\u2019s a bit bigger than you, you are absolutely implying that she is even worse/fatter.\n\nIf you are still making those comments and can\u2019t stop I\u2019d suggest therapy.

You didn't give her an ED and her saying that was harsh and absolutely unfair however comma your own negative self talk combined with the fact that you are still desirable (in her eyes) to others is making her feel worse. I went through similar things as your friend in high school and while I'd never actively blame any of those girls because it wasn't their fault or problem at the end of the day it made it difficult to be friends with them when they'd be size 4 with boyfriends complaining about how fat and ugly they are while I'd be a size 14/16 and single.

But teenagers are naturally very self centered so it makes sense I guess. \n\nIt's a natural time in your life to have the nature of your relationships change. What's important is learning and remembering that the way you treat friendships versus relationships matter, and your words can hurt even when that's not the intent.\n\nEta: to be clear you didn't give her an ED, that's not how eating disorders work. But being around disordered eating and having a friend constantly equating fat to being bad can absolutely trigger giving oneself an eating disorder, and that distinction is so hard to make at 17 that I kind of don't fault her for phrasing it that way in the middle of an overdue venting rant.

Atypical anorexia is the most common ED & it's basically anorexia without the underweight BMI.

For some people it can be of course (fishing for compliments, trying to get the other person to jump in all \"no what are you talking about, you're soooo skinny\").

If you wouldn't do it to a friend, don't do it to yourself.", "OP could have her own insecurities about her weight.

Yes OP saying she feels fat all the time probably didn't help, but there are lots of reasons why someone gets boyfriends and the other doesn't. It could be confidence or personality or style, not just \"thinness\". It's not up to OP to think of her friend's feelings before she goes out dating.\n\nIf I had a best friend who was thin and complained about being fat, I would have asked her to stop and explained how it made me feel.

Not anyone else's.\nThey both needed to be considering each other's issues not just their own.\nNTA as they both new the other has issues", "I don't think if a thin person remarks on how they're fat means they think anyone who is bigger than them is ugly. I'm trying to point out that it's a lot more complex than that. You can be thin, but it doesn't mean the weight you do have is flattering. Being thin doesn't mean you automatically have a flat or toned set of abs. You can still have a belly roll when you have a healthy BMI. If a thin person remarks on how they feel \"fat,\" it really shouldn't be applied to other people. They're remarking on *their* body, not on other people. I also think that a lot of people are more critical of themselves than they are of others.\n\nI think when people assume that thin people are fat shaming when they talk about their own bodies, they're really just excluding them from the conversation of body dysmorphia as a whole. Lots of people feel fat, and I think anyone who feels that way should be allowed to talk about those feelings without being told they're shaming others.", "I think you've expressed yourself really well here. \n\nI had a friend who listened to me when I asked her to stop using fat to put herself down and she started talking about how she felt and fit in her clothes instead. I prefer your solution because it still took a certain amount of emotional labour on my part to not hear fat when she said \"I hate how tight this top is getting on me\" but it felt like it was healthier for both of us because we were both making an effort for the other instead of it all going in one direction.", "I think reframing how you talk about it is great, but the reality is that a lot of people haven't gone to therapy for body dysmorphia or an ED and learned to talk about it the way you do. How you talk about it is also not really related to the point I'm making. I was just pointing out to someone above that it's wrong to think someone who is thin can't remark that they're \"fat\" without fat shaming others. \n\nA lot of times when a thin person says they feel fat, they're just expressing how they feel about themselves, and it really shouldn't be taken to mean anything about anyone else. I feel like a lot of people assume it's an insult without realizing that just because you are thin does not mean you are shapely. There are plenty of girls who are thin but gangly, or flat chested or curveless. Or, maybe they're thin, but the bit of weight they do carry happens to be a roll that makes them feel \"fat.\" \n\nWhen people equate thin people feeling fat to fat shaming, they're sending the message that thin people can't express they feel this way. Regardless of whether or not it's a positive way to express how they feel is a moot point. Can they word it better? Sure. I'm just pointing people shouldn't assume a thin person is fat shaming others just because they don't use the most proper verbiage to discuss how they feel about their bodies.", "Some people just hold themselves to a high standard of what they want their body fat % to be. \n\nI can still find someone heavier than me beautiful but I\u2019d never want myself to be that weight.", "\nIt helps to realize that what they\u2019re really saying is this: \u201cI hate the way my body looks. No matter what I do I always look awful. I think I am ugly fat no matter what I do. And my only value is in how I look, and I look terrible so I have no value.\n\n\u201cYou are not me. Ergo YOU can look good. You are pretty fat (or, alternatively, \u201cyou are much skinnier/carry it better than me\u201d). No matter what you do you look stunning. Your value is in every part of you, not just looks, so you are valuable.\u201d\n\nForget reality. It doesn\u2019t matter. This isn\u2019t about reality. In the mind of the insecure everyone else looks better and they always look worse. Doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re obviously skinnier. In their head you weigh less and they weigh more. And reality? He\u2019s pushing daisies.", "Words matter, there are definitely better ways for OP to voice her insecurities.", "That last sentence is one I live by.", "My best friend is a fat woman who supported & loved tf out of me when I was in the deepest depths of my ED. I learned a lot from her (& from fat activists & non-diet ED recovery folks) & am always trying my best to not hurt someone else when my ED brain kicks in & is being a jerk. I'm absolutely not perfect, but I'm trying!\n\nI'm glad you were able to start finding some better ground with your friend; I hope she keeps doing the work to keep improving. I'm sorry she still hurts you; that is better framing but it still isn't great \ud83d\ude15 Body shaming self-talk is so insidious & hard to stomp out without real effort.", "I don't think you're actually taking in what oeop6are saying because you seem to be ignoring the overwhelming message, which is \"you can be dissatisfied with how you look and express it without using language that hurts others\"  \n\nYou're putting all the onus on people to generously understand something they have no way of knowing. The benefit of the doubt is a good thing to give but if someone constantly needs to be given the benefit of the doubt, they eventually stop being given that benefit. \n\nOther people are insecure too. You can't insist that people who are already insecure about their bodies understand someone insulting themselves doesn't reflect on them, while also insisting the person insulting themself shouldn't have to consider the effects their words have on others. You can't walk around assuming others know what you mean because they must be more confident than you.", "Okay. But you're still calling it a higher standard. Which means people fatter than you are holding themselves to a lower standard. \"You're beautiful I just think I need to hold myself to a higher standard\" isn't a nice thing to say to them, or yourself really.", "I hear what you're saying, but I think it's fundamentally unfair to expect one person to put all the work into \"understanding\" someone's negative opinion of themselves while the other does nothing to either improve how they are towards themselves or negate the impact their insecurity is having on others.\n\nIf you have to ask others to forget reality in order for your words not to hurt them, you need to reconsider the words you use on yourself. If you're aware enough to understand all of what you've said, you're aware enough to understand others are having their own battles with reality. If you're not willing to change your behaviour for them, why should they change what they hear for you?\n\nNo one gets to decide the impact that their words have. We only get to decide the words we use.", "For completely neutral reasons we don't have the time to be in eachothers lives much anymore and body image doesn't come up when we have a chance to talk now, which is great. But yeah. I think it was healthy for both of us to go at the body conversations in a \"this is the size I'm comfortable at and I don't want to have to buy new clothes\" instead of \"I'm ashamed of xyz\"", "Some people care about being fit and athletic others do not. \n\nI\u2019m not judging people by their choices. \n\nAnd it is a good thing to say to yourself so you do not get complacent in life.", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re aware of the irrationality of it. Severe insecurity is, essentially, delusional in its extremes. They honestly believe everyone is better. A delusion born of insecurity instead of psychosis, but still a delusion.", "Do you not even see what you're doing in that reply?", "Fitness and athleticism have nothing to do with appearance, bodyweight, or percent body fat. You keep using moralizing language about weight and fitness when neither is a moral issue.", "But that's exactly what I'm saying. Everyone has their own inner galaxy of shit. That's why I don't think it's reasonable to expect the people who feel bad to understand \"the reality,\" because they could be living in the exact same reality, with the addition of a skinnier friend making them feel even worse. Insecurity is absolutely the chief issue at play here but it's not unique to the person insulting themselves in a way that insults others they care about", "Nah let me know", "What is bodybuilding then?", "And I\u2019m not expecting them to? I\u2019m saying it can - not will - help to realize the other person is irrational. It can be easier to step back if you recognize that it\u2019s not about you, but about them. \n\nBut I don\u2019t expect anyone to just do it. The point of clarifying what the thought process is is on the off chance that it helps someone. Either to recognize their own irrational thoughts, or to realize that it isn\u2019t about them. It can take a very long time to figure it out  on your own. I know from experience.\n\nMy mom has OCD, and recognizing that, and realizing nothing I did to clean was good enough because of it, was a huge help to my mental health. But it took me years to do that.", "Complacent is a word that carries moral overtones. You can absolutely hold yourself to a higher physical standard, but if you need to insult yourself with negative self talk in conversation with others to hold yourself accountable, you are being judgmental, and that judgement isn't limited to yourself, especially if you choose to externalize it...", "One sport =/= athleticism or fitness. And bodybuilding is definitely not about athleticism or fitness.", "And the reason I'm responding is so that people who think it's just fine to call themselves fat as an insult around bigger friends (replace the insult with whatever applies) might see this and understand that everyone is irrational and their actions are making it worse for others. That whatever irrational train of thought is telling them they're fat isn't unique to them and that they can hurt others with words directed at themselves.\n\nYes it might help someone to understand their friend is only hurting them by accident\n\nBut it would help them more for their friend to stop hurting them"]}
