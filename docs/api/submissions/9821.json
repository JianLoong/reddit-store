She is our second, our first was stillborn at term just over two years ago and I am still struggling massively and feel as though I\u2019m nothing like my former self.

I\u2019m just lazy and miserable and hating life really and I do feel guilty to my daughter for being this way. (I am still super cheery with her when I have her so hopefully she\u2019s not picking up any bad vibes from me it\u2019s just the not getting outside much) he has a daughter from a previous relationship who is 3. Their current arrangement is tues-thurs one week, and tues-fri the following week alternating. He\u2019s said he\u2019ll try to ask for every other weekend, and the weekends he doesn\u2019t have her, he\u2019ll ask to stick to the current arrangement. this would mean me having to look after her for 9/10 hours a day on those days. I\u2019ve said im not happy to do it and it\u2019s caused a whole load of sh*t. Am I being unreasonable? Should I agree to it? its just not something I want to do, I don\u2019t know if that makes me selfish. I feel like if I was to have that time and energy to do something I\u2019d rather do it for me or my daughter. It feels awful writing it but it\u2019s the truth and how I feel\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019ll be returning to my WFH job in the next 3-4 months, so it will not be possible to watch her then anyway.\n\nEdit to add again: when I begin working again it\u2019ll be from home so my baby will be with me. I\u2019ll only be returning part time to begin with (2 days per week) and if I do struggle my mum is able to have our daughter on those days. I\u2019m in the UK so am receiving maternity pay and could stay off longer if I really wanted to but financially we\u2019d be better with me doing a couple days. \nI don\u2019t mind my partners daughter being around at all, I just do not want to watch her multiple days every other week. I do feel overwhelmed with the adjustments that come with having a new baby and I\u2019m certain my mental health would decline further if I were to agree to this.

That is far different from being her caretaker. Her actual parents are responsible for seeing that she's looked after. He can ask you, sure, but you're not an AH if the answer is no. I assume her mom works and puts her in some kind of childcare while doing so? So the same goes for him. This is *his* responsibility. Gaining a partner doesn't mean also gaining a live in babysitter.

Accepting a person's kids doesn't mean giving all of yourself to them--it just means you've got some extra young people in your life to be nice to. They require consideration and respect, but not your whole being, the way being a parent does.", "\"It's NOT your responsibility\" is my quote\n\nKeyword is NOT.", "Hold on though, let's get into how YOU AND OTHERS CANT READ\n\nBecause I think I said it's not her responsibility. But if YOU or anyone else starts dating someone with a kid then marry that person guess what, that kid is now part of your family and if you dont want to deal with someone else's kid, you probably shouldn't get pregnant by them a month after they have a newborn", "\nU said u r in the UK please go to the doctor, this sounds like you need professional help. Stillbirth is a traumatic event, and PPD is very common and not something that\u2019s your fault. \n\nThis is something above your partner\u2019s pay grade to handle", "You can still get without someone without having to deal with his other kids? Obviously as long as the other person doesn't mind.", "It's stupid to marry someone and not want to be bothered with their kid. It's so many single people in the world without kids. You can find one. Stop making excuses. if this was a man saying he doesnt' want to be bothered with his wife's child, y'all would throw a fit.", "When she decided to hook up permanently with a guy that had 50% shared care of his child she did agree to some responsibility. Not responsibility like a parent, but a child that spends 50% of time with your family is part of your familial consideration.\n\nI still can't find a post that says she gets maternity pay, just the edit of the OP. And in the UK the first 6 weeks is at 90% pay, the rest is \u00a3156.66 a week at most. Cite below. I have no issue with maternity leave but you can't take it, reduce household income, and pretend a step child who is with you 50% of the time is just visiting and not a household responsibility. If you make a life with someone with a kid, said kid is part of the household and all adults in the household need to deal with that. His kid is his responsibility but changing custody to match a change of job takes time, if you don't want to deal with that don't date someone with kids.\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/employers-maternity-pay-leave", "\"If this was a man saying he doesn't want to be bothered with his wife's child, y'all would throw a fit\"\n\nThat was all I needed to know \ud83d\udc80", "Good I hope you will move on now.", "The only thing I'll be moving on from is you bringing up the gender issue in a case which has nothing to do with gender. \n\nBut thank you, have a good day.", "And your comment tells me everything about you. You think it's okay for ppl to date others without liking their kids and it's ok to marry them. That's why we have 100 posts daily on people not liking their stepparents. Because people like you and others date people with kids when you know you don't want to be deal with the kids. It's unfair and corny. I hope you have a terrible day", "Did I say anything about liking their kids? Ironic how you said something about not being able to read in the previous comment. All I'm trying to say is that as long as it's okay with both the partners to not interact with each other's step kids, there's no problem. If OP's partner doesn't want that, he can breakup. \nAnd most of the posts about kids not liking their step-parents comes from kids who are old enough to read and write, and who's step parents treat them in a bad way. In this case, OP is trying not to treat them in a bad way, by not dealing with them at all. And I don't see the step-kid crying and whining to get OP's attention.\n\nFYI: I don't date people with step-kids, I'm not even old enough to drive. I just have a thing called rationality, free will and choice.\n\nThis will be my last towards you. So I suggest we agree to disagree."]}
