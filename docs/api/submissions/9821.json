That is far different from being her caretaker. Her actual parents are responsible for seeing that she's looked after. He can ask you, sure, but you're not an AH if the answer is no. I assume her mom works and puts her in some kind of childcare while doing so? So the same goes for him. This is *his* responsibility. Gaining a partner doesn't mean also gaining a live in babysitter.

The other thing I want to say is that a year ago you didn't have the extra hormones in you, as you know, they can make a big difference. Sometimes meds are needed to correct them and that is okay. As far as your question about watching your partners kid NTA. Because just because you got with someone with a kid before you got together didn't mean you signed up to be a babysitter I could see in a emergency or even every once in awhile ( when you feeling better and If you want to) but on schedule is not fair to you.

I went through quite a few until I found the one who knew how to ask the questions in a way I could hear the answers. They can't heal me, you see - they help me find out how to heal myself. But it takes the right person to speak in a way I can personally understand.\n\nI wish you the best.", "Ok, thanks.", "See edit, but that\u2019s immaterial. OP has chosen to nearly-inextricably tie herself to this man, by having a child with him. She knew that he had a toddler which he shared custody of. This sub is consistent that it is wrong to treat step-children as less-than bio kids, and that applies here. She is caring for their shared child, his child doesn\u2019t deserve to be made to feel like an outsider because OP doesn\u2019t want to care for her too. \n\nOP needs help, clearly, including counseling for PPD and to deal with the tragic loss of their first child. That doesn\u2019t exclude her from a responsibility to treat the 3 year old with dignity and love as well."]}
