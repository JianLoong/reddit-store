Every time he comes over to my house, he was always stealing from my brother. Mind you, he is a very spoiled teen who gets anything he wants with a flick of a finger. I started suspecting him because my brother\u2019s money jar had gone missing and he was the only one in the room while everyone else was downstairs. Comic books, posters, colognes, even my brother\u2019s clothes were missing at some point too. At this point, I tried to confront Evan, telling him stealing is wrong and if you want something, you need to ask. He got all pissed off, saying my brother was irresponsible and it\u2019s not his fault things had gone missing and also told me to mind my own business. Not sure why he kept denying it since things only go missing at our house only when he\u2019s there. I couldn\u2019t also mind my own business because as a big sister, you\u2019re supposed to protect your sibling. \n\nThe last straw was when my brother got an expensive watch for Christmas and as soon as Evan saw it, I knew he was going to take it and I had to stop him. While the rest of my family was in the living room, I snuck up to my brother\u2019s room, took the watch, and hid it in a shoebox. My brother noticed his watch was missing and started frantically looking for it. I encouraged all the guest to help look the watch, knowing it was in a shoebox. My parents weren\u2019t too happy with my brother and the rest of my extended family home. The next day, my family and I had to go to my aunt\u2019s (Evan\u2019s mom) house for dinner and I took the watch with me. As my family was conversing with Evan\u2019s parents. I snuck up to Evan\u2019s room to plant the watch somewhere. I checked under his bed and guess what I found. All the missing stuff from our house was right under his bed. I decided to plant the watch in a drawer and loudly called my brother upstairs. I told my brother, \u201dHey, isn\u2019t this the watch you got yesterday for Christmas?\u201d My brother was confused and said \u201cYes\u201d. He angrily called up Evan and asked him why his missing watch was in his drawer. Evan was confused and declined ever taking the watch. I even decided to pull out Evan\u2019s little stash of stolen things. Evan\u2019s face was pure white and my brother started cursing at him loudly for taking his stuff, which caused everyone else to come upstairs to see what was happening.

While I totally understand the need for justice and for Evan to finally get caught, you took the watch prior to having any solid confirmation of the stolen goods having been taken by Evan.
