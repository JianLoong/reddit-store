I go to my mother\u2019s (38F) house from time to time to help with errands but that\u2019s it. I hate staying there because it is messy and loud, which is acceptable because of my baby brother (2M) but I genuinely can\u2019t stand it. He has his own nanny but she\u2019s on a day off because its January 1. So, my mother has been taking care of him since yesterday and I took care of him during new year\u2019s eve but I was honestly just annoyed the whole time because he kept running around the restaurant and I was always anxious about him getting into an accident. I told my mother that he\u2019s too active and she told me that he cant be reprimanded so I should just let him be. I got home at around 2 am. Now, I woke up to a text from her asking to drive her an hour away so my baby brother can go out. If I don\u2019t want to, she asked me to bring him to my place and she will go with her friends. I refused for various reasons, such as: I know that I will run after him the whole time, and he\u2019s too hyperactive so staying indoors can also be hard. He\u2019s always looking for our mom so he cries really loud, too. She then got mad at me by saying that I\u2019m not the only one that gets tired (she cleaned the house today) and that I don\u2019t help with anything so I should never require her to pay for my tuition (I\u2019m in college and it\u2019s expensive so even if I was working, I couldn\u2019t afford it) Personally, I just don\u2019t want to spend the first day of my year babysitting. I changed my mind a few minutes after to \u201chelp\u201d and I was worried about my tuition fee but I found out that she blocked me everywhere after that.", "created_utc": 1672539523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1009npy/aita_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_hyperactive/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not your kid and you don\u2019t live there even. It\u2019s wrong of her to threaten your tuition over it since I\u2019m guessing there was not an agreement at the start that she\u2019d pay as long as you watched him. Also the fact that you can\u2019t even reprimand him makes it even worse and all the more reason to not watch him.", "NTA\n\nBut as long as you are financially dependent on someone else, they can control what you do. Doesn't matter if it's a parent, partner, etc. If you choose to not help her out (by babysitting on occasion) then you can't really be surprised if she returns the favor and stops helping you out (paying tuition).", "NTA When you have kids, you can't expect to pawn them off on someone else whenever they are mildly inconvenient for you. Your mother is TA for not reprimanding him. You can reprimand a 2 year old in an age appropriate manner. If she doesn't start working on his behavior, it will get progressively worse.", "NTA.  You don\u2019t live there.  You don\u2019t have to help her.  And she\u2019s shitty threatening your college tuition. Where\u2019s your brother\u2019s father?", "NTA as a kindness, with warning, you can agree to watch your brother in your mother's house where it has been childproofed. Calling you the morning of to drive an hour? No, sorry, way too many plans.", "NTA\n\nI get your concern about tuition but it isn't appropriate for your mom to hold that over your head. If possible, i would have a clear discussion on that point with your mom. I get it about her helping to pay tuition as university is insane expensive nowadays and is almost absurd to expect anyone to pay what they are asking for nowadays.\n\nBut i suggest you talk with your mom to understand her expectations. Is she paying your tuition with strings attached (expecting help with her kid?) Or is it more or less that you do well and study hard and she will help. This way you know where you stand with her support and expectations. Things like that can build resentment and tension and is always best to make sure matters are clear.", "NTA for reasons previously stated by others on here, but I'm curious as to where dad is in all this?", "NTA. You did not choose to have a baby, she did. She can stop paying your tuition, it's her money after all, but threatening it to manipulate you is financial abuse. She is TA.\n\n> Personally, I just don\u2019t want to spend the first day of my year babysitting.\n\nPerfectly valid reason. Use this next time. Don't blame the kids behavior, he is 2. If you keep doing it like this, your brother will start picking it up at some point and will feel he is at fault for the bad relationship between you and your mother. Or your mother uses it to destroy your relationship with your brother at some point in the future (\"Did you know your sister never wanted to look after you because she found you annoying?\") It wouldn't be true, but it would be what you told your mother (she would still be an AH for weaponizing it of course.) \n\nI totally understand making up random excuses instead of just saying \"No, I don't want to\". \"No\" was never an acceptable response when I grew up and it seems similar for you.", "NTA And a 2yo can certainly be reprimanded. You just have to be smarter than a 2yo.", "NTA. \n\nNot your kid, not your responsibility. \n\nAnd also, the \u201che can\u2019t be reprimanded\u201d thing is a HUGE problem. Kid is going to be a nightmare.", "NTA I tell her straight up that\u2019s not my kid I don\u2019t live with her and she needs to except that responsibility so she decided to have them do you have no obligation to help her it would be nice but you\u2019re not responsible for him", "NTA for not wanting to look after your brother. He is your mum's responsibility and not yours.\n\nWhat I don't get though is that you're 19, an adult living away from home so why on earth would you be expecting your mum to pay for your tuition? You decided to go to university, so surely it is your responsibility to  pay for your own education. If you can't afford it with working and/or student loans, it's not your mum's responsibility and you should cut your cloth accordingly.\n\nMaybe it's a cultural thing, but out of everyone I've ever known get a degree, we've all paid for it ourselves. Nobody (generally where I'm from!)  asks their parents for financial support after they turn 18 and become an adult. If your mum is supporting you financially when she doesn't have to, is it too much for her to ask for help off you every now and then?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Therefore I worked my ass off just to get where I am and I even faked some information just to be able to study. I dropped out because working while studying was badly affecting my health as I would only get an hour of sleep.
