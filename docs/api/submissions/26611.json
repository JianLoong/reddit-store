She does ask me a lot of questions about my country and sort of sees me as \u2018the guy from x country\u2019 with the stereotypes associated, which is annoying, but otherwise she\u2019s okay.\n\nOne issue is that she\u2019s a bit on the chubby side, by US standards, and is extremely sensitive about people pointing it out for shaming her. My country tends to have much skinnier people than the US, and the standards tend to be stringent, so if she\u2019s considered chubby in the US, you can imagine what people in my home country would think.\n\nSaid country can be incredibly shallow with physical appearances as well as blunt when talking about them, so it\u2019s almost a guarantee that she will be seen as overweight and comments will be made about it. I\u2019ve seen it happen to girls way skinnier than her, who\u2019d be considered stick thin in the US.\n\nSo, when she asked me about my country and what her experience would be like in said country, I explained the pros and cons, and one of the cons was that there\u2019s extreme weight watching and it\u2019s considered perfectly socially acceptable to comment on and make jokes at the expense of peoples weight. \n\nI said this because I wanted her to have this info before deciding to study abroad there, so she doesn\u2019t potentially put herself in an upsetting or traumatic experience.

You didn't criticize her weight, you gave her the answer to her question. If you are talking about South Korea you are correct.

She has to import jeans because she is taller (and proportionally wider) than most Nepali women. \n\nWhen I lived in Kenya I was horrified to hear a Kenyan friend call someone \u201csooo fat\u201d. It took a while for me to realise that to her it was a compliment. I should send her some recent photos. She\u2019ll be so proud of me \ud83d\ude02\n\nKnowing these cultural differences will help her prepare for her trip. If this had been the first or only point you\u2019d made it would kinda suck but unfortunately you needed to touch on something she was sensitive about so that she didn\u2019t head off on the trip of a lifetime only to feel body shamed for the whole trip.", "NTA. I think you presented it well, honestly and factually. and it's better that she knows this beforehand, which is why she asked you about experiences in your country. You weren't being malicious. If she can't deal with the actual situation, that's on her.", "NTA, she asked you answered. Plus you didn't tell her she is fat, you said that norms in your country are different.\n\n\nOn that note, when did we go from: \"I don't like you pointing out my x-quality\" to \"you are x-shaming me\"?", "NTA. \n\nThis is another cultural difference. Americans hate being told the truth, other cultures are more honest - and it can come off as rather blunt or insulting.\n\nIf she can't even handle your warning, how is she going to handle the real thing?", "About 20 years ago, I went on a tour to Vietnam. One of my Vietnamese coworkers told me I wouldn't like it there but wouldn't say why and I assumed he meant because I hate the heat. Anyway I was much more sensitive about my weight back then and it was a pretty horrible experience for me. Not just fat comments but people constantly touching me, poking and prodding me (I hate being touched esp by strangers). I got to the point where I didn't want to leave my hotel room. \n\nSo yeah, NTA. I'd have preferred to have known upfront but then probably had to have experienced it to know what it was really like.", "NTA. She asked and you gave her the info. If she can't handle it, that's on her.", "LOL very much NTA.\n\nMy friend lives and works in Japan. He is at a healthy weight (BMI is about 23). He's been told by coworkers point-blank that he is fat.\n\nI've also visited Japan with a friend. In US sizes, I'm usually most comfortable in a large. My friend is around an XXL. Everything in Japan is simply made for smaller people. My friend is also sensitive about her weight and was on the verge of tears when she found she could barely fit in the train seats or had difficulty moving in a bathroom stall. She said she felt very self-conscious about how much space she took up compared to everyone else. And even I, a smaller person (but still overweight), felt like a whale sometimes.\n\nYou were simply telling her the truth of the matter. If she can't handle this, then she won't be able to handle a culture that values extreme thinness.", "Nigerians and some Indians do not hold back either. Sometimes, it may be banter but it cuts deep.", "For a minute there I thought you were talking a out S. Korea but seeing your replies to others I'm thinking Japan or China.\n\nBut NTA.\nHonestly.... as a plus size woman myself, I wasn't offended about what you said. If she's touchy about the subject as it is in America, she wouldn't survive the mockery in said Asian country.", "NTA.  It's a tough question that she threw at you, and as a decent and honest person, you gave her your insights on how she will be seen.  Folks that care will be honest.  \n\nAsk her to watch that 90-day fianc\u00e9e show. Tell her to watch the reaction those dudes have when they meet their fat, American woman is similar to what you're saying that she will experience.", "OP, NTA. If she has a serious interest in learning more about your country, then the negative aspects are just as important as the positive. If the truth is that strangers are likely to tell random people that they are fat, and you know that she would be viewed by anyone in your home country as fat, then she needs to be prepared for this to happen. If she's watched any Asian dramas, she should already know about this. Plenty of storylines have someone who is clearly a normal BMI or even underweight who says that they are on a diet or another character calls them fat. Her sensitivity about her weight or body shape is not your problem. \n\nWhen I was in Ho Chi Minh city about 10 years ago, I saw a dress in a high-end designer's store that was so beautiful I had to go look at it up close. The sales associate approached me and said, \"Madam, I'm so sorry that we only have this dress in the one size. Perhaps you would like to look at our shoes?\"\n\nIt was hilarious to me, because, as an older American visiting the country, I knew that of course I wasn't ever going to fit in the clothing that the stores stocked in sizes for the local Vietnamese population. Yet he was so polite and diplomatic about telling me that they had nothing in the store that I could wear except shoes.", "NTA  \nI consider myself \"normal\" and I was told I was thin and small in Germany and chubby in Japan. Different countries, different ways of seing people.", "NTA. I was a bit skeptical when I started reading but you worded it really nicely.

You weren\u2019t shaming her for it \u2014 you just informed her about the culture surrounding weight in your home country. If you want to remain friends, I would probably apologize for the misunderstanding and restate that you didn\u2019t mean any harm but were trying to give her a warning that even thin people by US standards are shamed. But you are definitely NTA.", "NTA. She asked and you replied, not your fault she\u2019s insecure. \n\nShe also criticised you for implying she\u2019s fat, but you\u2019re not wrong for saying that when it\u2019s true, especially if she\u2019s chubby for US standards.", "NTA, at all. As someone who is overweight because of a health issue, I would absolutely want to know before I invest all of this time, energy, and excitement into visiting a country and finding out they're fat-phobic to the point of being rude and hurtful. I visited Paris once when I was thinner and thought it was beautiful. I've dreamed of going back but after doing some research, apparently, they're one of the most fat-phobic in Europe. I have no interest in going there now, it's not worth it to be treated with disrespect, especially if I'm doing my best to learn their language and immerse myself in their culture. I would be so hurt", "To be honest, my finger were reflexsively reaching for that Y, but well.\n\nYou said this about as nicely as you possibly could. I can even see you coming from a place of \"I really don't want this girl to get traumatized.\"\n\nNTA, this about the nicest way you could have clued her in on this.", " NTA\n\nHilarious, if she can't handle you saying they are critical of larger people and not directly tossing her in the mix then how TF she going to be with the real deal? You softened the blow and she struggled with that, good luck with people straight up making pig noises or whatever", "NTA. \u201cFun\u201d fact: it\u2019s actually illegal in Japan to be overweight unless you are a sumo wrestler. (Yes I did a spit take myself when I found out)", "NTA. I am going to assume it is an asian country before I even start reading comments. My mom was japanese and they have NO problem telling you that you gained weight or are fat....or that your face looks like crap. Ok,...thanks grandma I know I gained weight so WHY are you offering me so much damn food?!! lol   \"here, you have to eat this \ud83c\udf71\ud83c\udf5a and this\ud83c\udf58\ud83c\udf59  before you leave..and also you are getting fat\"    \ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28.

It's on her if she's mad.  NTAH.", "There's a lady on tiktok who studies abroad in Thailand and she said they made comments on her height and weight all the time and she wasn't even fat or that tall.

Reality is triggering.", "NTA.\n\nCan't be fat shamed if not fat", "NTA, not wrong telling her just how it is without sugar coating.", "I find you extremely respectful, and I think you said the right words, she has the problem, don't take it personally, It's difficult to hear those things if you don't have a good image of yourself, you complied with answering her question NTA", "If she's fat by American standards, her gravity field must disturb Jupiter.", "I don't think we have enough information on the tone and how was this information transferred. It's not the same to say \"You are too fat for this country, you'll be shamed\" than to say \"These are the pros and these are the cons [...]. One of the cons is that people are extremely fat-phobic and even skinny people get shamed\". Being tactful in a conversation is an art.", "And you\u2019d be first in line! Way to go!", "Soft YTA. It seems you...well, depends on country? China? I hear it's awful there at present for overweight folk. Japan? I'm a fat person in Japan and have not experienced any blatant fat shaming.
