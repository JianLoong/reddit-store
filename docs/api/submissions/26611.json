One girl I know at said college happens to be really into my country of origin\u2014 the culture, the music, the TV shows, etc\u2014 and wants to study abroad there. She does ask me a lot of questions about my country and sort of sees me as \u2018the guy from x country\u2019 with the stereotypes associated, which is annoying, but otherwise she\u2019s okay.\n\nOne issue is that she\u2019s a bit on the chubby side, by US standards, and is extremely sensitive about people pointing it out for shaming her. My country tends to have much skinnier people than the US, and the standards tend to be stringent, so if she\u2019s considered chubby in the US, you can imagine what people in my home country would think.\n\nSaid country can be incredibly shallow with physical appearances as well as blunt when talking about them, so it\u2019s almost a guarantee that she will be seen as overweight and comments will be made about it. I\u2019ve seen it happen to girls way skinnier than her, who\u2019d be considered stick thin in the US.\n\nSo, when she asked me about my country and what her experience would be like in said country, I explained the pros and cons, and one of the cons was that there\u2019s extreme weight watching and it\u2019s considered perfectly socially acceptable to comment on and make jokes at the expense of peoples weight. \n\nI said this because I wanted her to have this info before deciding to study abroad there, so she doesn\u2019t potentially put herself in an upsetting or traumatic experience. But she instead got offended and said I\u2019m an AH for implying she\u2019s fat. \n\nI replied that it\u2019s just standards are different so even though she\u2019s not fat she could be perceived that way because the standards in my country are off the charts insane. \n\nShe was still angry and walked away.

You didn't criticize her weight, you gave her the answer to her question. If you are talking about South Korea you are correct. They even put pressure on thin k-pop idols to go on diets, male and female.\n\nBut it's her life and she will find pros and cons anyplace she goes as a foreigner.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nMy Scottish friend lives in Nepal. She has to import jeans because she is taller (and proportionally wider) than most Nepali women. \n\nWhen I lived in Kenya I was horrified to hear a Kenyan friend call someone \u201csooo fat\u201d. It took a while for me to realise that to her it was a compliment. I should send her some recent photos. She\u2019ll be so proud of me \ud83d\ude02\n\nKnowing these cultural differences will help her prepare for her trip. If this had been the first or only point you\u2019d made it would kinda suck but unfortunately you needed to touch on something she was sensitive about so that she didn\u2019t head off on the trip of a lifetime only to feel body shamed for the whole trip.", "NTA. I think you presented it well, honestly and factually. and it's better that she knows this beforehand, which is why she asked you about experiences in your country. You weren't being malicious. If she can't deal with the actual situation, that's on her.", "NTA, she asked you answered. Plus you didn't tell her she is fat, you said that norms in your country are different.\n\n\nOn that note, when did we go from: \"I don't like you pointing out my x-quality\" to \"you are x-shaming me\"?", "NTA. \n\nThis is another cultural difference. Americans hate being told the truth, other cultures are more honest - and it can come off as rather blunt or insulting.\n\nIf she can't even handle your warning, how is she going to handle the real thing?", "About 20 years ago, I went on a tour to Vietnam. One of my Vietnamese coworkers told me I wouldn't like it there but wouldn't say why and I assumed he meant because I hate the heat. Anyway I was much more sensitive about my weight back then and it was a pretty horrible experience for me. Not just fat comments but people constantly touching me, poking and prodding me (I hate being touched esp by strangers). I got to the point where I didn't want to leave my hotel room. \n\nSo yeah, NTA. I'd have preferred to have known upfront but then probably had to have experienced it to know what it was really like.", "NTA. She asked and you gave her the info. If she can't handle it, that's on her.", "LOL very much NTA.\n\nMy friend lives and works in Japan. He is at a healthy weight (BMI is about 23). He's been told by coworkers point-blank that he is fat.\n\nI've also visited Japan with a friend. In US sizes, I'm usually most comfortable in a large. My friend is around an XXL. Everything in Japan is simply made for smaller people. My friend is also sensitive about her weight and was on the verge of tears when she found she could barely fit in the train seats or had difficulty moving in a bathroom stall. She said she felt very self-conscious about how much space she took up compared to everyone else. And even I, a smaller person (but still overweight), felt like a whale sometimes.\n\nYou were simply telling her the truth of the matter. If she can't handle this, then she won't be able to handle a culture that values extreme thinness.", "Nigerians and some Indians do not hold back either. Sometimes, it may be banter but it cuts deep.", "For a minute there I thought you were talking a out S. Korea but seeing your replies to others I'm thinking Japan or China.\n\nBut NTA.\nHonestly.... as a plus size woman myself, I wasn't offended about what you said. If she's touchy about the subject as it is in America, she wouldn't survive the mockery in said Asian country.", "NTA.  It's a tough question that she threw at you, and as a decent and honest person, you gave her your insights on how she will be seen.  Folks that care will be honest.  \n\nAsk her to watch that 90-day fianc\u00e9e show. Tell her to watch the reaction those dudes have when they meet their fat, American woman is similar to what you're saying that she will experience.", "OP, NTA. If she has a serious interest in learning more about your country, then the negative aspects are just as important as the positive. If the truth is that strangers are likely to tell random people that they are fat, and you know that she would be viewed by anyone in your home country as fat, then she needs to be prepared for this to happen. If she's watched any Asian dramas, she should already know about this. Plenty of storylines have someone who is clearly a normal BMI or even underweight who says that they are on a diet or another character calls them fat. Her sensitivity about her weight or body shape is not your problem. \n\nWhen I was in Ho Chi Minh city about 10 years ago, I saw a dress in a high-end designer's store that was so beautiful I had to go look at it up close. The sales associate approached me and said, \"Madam, I'm so sorry that we only have this dress in the one size. Perhaps you would like to look at our shoes?\"\n\nIt was hilarious to me, because, as an older American visiting the country, I knew that of course I wasn't ever going to fit in the clothing that the stores stocked in sizes for the local Vietnamese population. Yet he was so polite and diplomatic about telling me that they had nothing in the store that I could wear except shoes.", "NTA  \nI consider myself \"normal\" and I was told I was thin and small in Germany and chubby in Japan. Different countries, different ways of seing people.", "NTA. I was a bit skeptical when I started reading but you worded it really nicely.

You weren\u2019t shaming her for it \u2014 you just informed her about the culture surrounding weight in your home country. If you want to remain friends, I would probably apologize for the misunderstanding and restate that you didn\u2019t mean any harm but were trying to give her a warning that even thin people by US standards are shamed. But you are definitely NTA.", "NTA. She asked and you replied, not your fault she\u2019s insecure. \n\nShe also criticised you for implying she\u2019s fat, but you\u2019re not wrong for saying that when it\u2019s true, especially if she\u2019s chubby for US standards.", "NTA, at all. As someone who is overweight because of a health issue, I would absolutely want to know before I invest all of this time, energy, and excitement into visiting a country and finding out they're fat-phobic to the point of being rude and hurtful. I visited Paris once when I was thinner and thought it was beautiful. I've dreamed of going back but after doing some research, apparently, they're one of the most fat-phobic in Europe. I have no interest in going there now, it's not worth it to be treated with disrespect, especially if I'm doing my best to learn their language and immerse myself in their culture. I would be so hurt", "To be honest, my finger were reflexsively reaching for that Y, but well.\n\nYou said this about as nicely as you possibly could. I can even see you coming from a place of \"I really don't want this girl to get traumatized.\"\n\nNTA, this about the nicest way you could have clued her in on this.", " NTA\n\nHilarious, if she can't handle you saying they are critical of larger people and not directly tossing her in the mix then how TF she going to be with the real deal? You softened the blow and she struggled with that, good luck with people straight up making pig noises or whatever", "NTA. \u201cFun\u201d fact: it\u2019s actually illegal in Japan to be overweight unless you are a sumo wrestler. (Yes I did a spit take myself when I found out)", "NTA. I am going to assume it is an asian country before I even start reading comments. My mom was japanese and they have NO problem telling you that you gained weight or are fat....or that your face looks like crap. Ok,...thanks grandma I know I gained weight so WHY are you offering me so much damn food?!! lol   \"here, you have to eat this \ud83c\udf71\ud83c\udf5a and this\ud83c\udf58\ud83c\udf59  before you leave..and also you are getting fat\"    \ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28.

It's on her if she's mad.  NTAH.", "There's a lady on tiktok who studies abroad in Thailand and she said they made comments on her height and weight all the time and she wasn't even fat or that tall.

Reality is triggering.", "NTA.\n\nCan't be fat shamed if not fat", "NTA, not wrong telling her just how it is without sugar coating.", "I find you extremely respectful, and I think you said the right words, she has the problem, don't take it personally, It's difficult to hear those things if you don't have a good image of yourself, you complied with answering her question NTA", "If she's fat by American standards, her gravity field must disturb Jupiter.", "I don't think we have enough information on the tone and how was this information transferred. It's not the same to say \"You are too fat for this country, you'll be shamed\" than to say \"These are the pros and these are the cons [...]. One of the cons is that people are extremely fat-phobic and even skinny people get shamed\". Being tactful in a conversation is an art.", "And you\u2019d be first in line! Way to go!", "Soft YTA. It seems you...well, depends on country? China? I hear it's awful there at present for overweight folk. Japan? I'm a fat person in Japan and have not experienced any blatant fat shaming.

It is not for those with thin skin.", "China, close enough in this aspect", "I was thinking Japan", "If she can\u2019t even handle you *telling* her that this is an experience she may have in said country without getting offended, how will she feel if/when she actually experiences it", "I mean, I'm considered short and skinny in my country, was considered short and very skinny when studying in the US and when I went to work in China... I was called tall and normal (not skinny). That's the way it is. I don't see a point of going pickachu face and taking out x-shaming card", "Different countries = different standards. What she views as rude it may be an everyday thing in the other side of the world \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. And no way people gonna stop doing/saying things just because she gets offended.", "Ah I see. This was my second guess.", "Especially those in Paris! The nice people there were tourists", "Truest statement ever", "I agree. I have French friends and a mutual friend lost weight and their comments were \u201cwell she never should\u2019ve been fat in the first place\u2026\u201d NTA", "None. They are just encouraged to lose weight at a yearly health check for their job.", "It's not illegal to be overweight here. That's a mischaracterization spread about by meme. It's technically illegal for an employer large enough to be required to co-pay public health insurance not to do what they can to encourage you to lose weight, but there's no particular penalty. Getting the annual corporate physical (and the inevitable doctor's admonition to lose weight) is sufficient. As for definitions, they use waist hip ratio and BMI, basically.", "Interesting that I say the most simple statement and im told to grow up after fat shaming his friend lol.", "In the film \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" there's a scene where the mother bluntly says to her daughter \"You need to eat better, you are getting fat.\"\n\nGot a chuckle from the cinema goers, but one of my friends (Singaporean Chinese) was just like \"Yep, that's just what my mum's like.\"", "My mom told me I was gaining too much weight from the age of 16 to 24..when I was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. \n\nShe's Asian (south-asian). It's a thing.", "Lol seriously. Married into an Asian family. My husband is called \u201cLittle Man\u201d in Cantonese since he\u2019s the youngest; Im called \u201cFat Girl.\u201d Its so blunt and honest and hilariously refreshing. Its not even from a mean place, just them describing us.", "When I went backpacking in China, I was the thinnest I\u2019ve ever been. Hiked Xi\u2019an carrying my bag and my friend\u2019s bag kind of fit. \n\nI had to pick up a pair of pants and the only pair I could find that fit a North America size 6 was an XL. \n\nSizing there was wild.", "That sounds better than fake friendliness and forced compliments, to be honest. Refreshing. As long as once the comments have been made, all parties can move along.", "i mean, china is now getting increasingly more popular with western audiences thanks to its gay media, so it's not only south korea or japan anymore.", "I guessed Japan. \n\nA lot of anime fans romanticize Japan because \u201cteehee quirky anime humor.\u201d\n\nI was surprised it was China.", "I cannot be North Korea. No one would dare to fat shame someone in this worker\u2019s paradise. At least not that chubby guy with the distinct haircut.", "I know it's intended as a bad thing, but I'd be so stoked if someone called my legs mighty. Just,  \"yeah!..stomp Stomp STOMP\"", ">\u201cyour legs are so mighty!\u201d \n\nI would take this as a major compliment", "In high school I was a size small/medium depending on the brand I wore. I could barely wear large or XL when I tried to buy some clothes in Vietnam. An auntie who ran the stand said I'd be so cute if I lost weight and my actual aunt told her it was different in America. Shop auntie then tried to hook me up with her son and said he likes fat girls...", "Yeah me too", "Japanese don\u2019t shame people to their face for being fat everyone.", "Counter point - when I studied abroad, being *surrounded* by things that made me uncomfortable made it much harder to argue with those things. In the us, she can claim \u201cfat shaming\u201d or whatever\u2026 in a country where that\u2019s just the culture\u2026 it\u2019s much harder to find someone on your side and you just\u2026 grow a thicker skin", "Exactly. Standards are different, that\u2019s common sense, and I don\u2019t think people should be offended to hear that", "Idk, the french people in Paris were exceptionally kind to me and my family. We brought our dictionary with us and made an effort to speak French, and they'd usually switch to English and be very helpful and smiley. But none of us were fat or anything so it could have played a factor", "That needs to come to my country so badly. \n\nObesity rates have sky-rocketed and nothing is being done about it. It's fucked up.", "There was no fat shaming. She is overweight, and she asks his opinion, and he tells her the cultural difference that would affect her. He felt bad about it, but he was honest. \n\nIf that is wrong to you, you need to grow up.", "To be fair East Asians in general are pretty brutally honest within the family, but there's more variance with how they will react to strangers. Younger generations are more likely to mind their business while older generations might say something to the effect of \"you're ruining your potential by being fat etc\". It's rarely ever a malicious comment though, mostly a \"thanks, but not really your business\" comment.", "I was \u201clittle fat girl\u201d in my family! My mom is super skinny now, but she was chubby as a baby so my grandparents called her \u201clittle fat.\u201d", "Really?  I used to want to go visit China and still do but it seems like they are getting more and more authoritarian.", "Yeah my comment was made in jest, I assumed Japan as well", "Too late, you have already been reported.", "I always have to override the instinct to slap my thighs and resist saying something cheeky like \u201cyeah these ole skull crushers? Strong as hell, fam!\u201d but uh tough crowd, it\u2019s not gonna land with them.", "Mighty like Thor!", "Kind of like the term \"Thunder Thighs\" in the West. I always kind of liked that though. Sounds mythological.", "Yes. Same goes for some questions being acceptable and not. It's just a cultural thing. Beauty standards included. Can't count how many times I was asked my age and if I'm married / have a boyfriend by random people I don't even know while being abroad. You just have to learn to accept cultural differences", "I mean the advice I got from the doctor was, \"You should cut out salt to lose weight.\"\n\nSo not really useful.", "When does reality affect an obsessed fan?", "I needed this laugh today, thank you. And good for you for being such a good sport about it, I think I'd be shamed forever!", "Lol strong like bull!", "The internet is full of useful information. The main consensus (speaking as a former personal trainer for over a decade) that may be helpful to you is this process:\n\nI. Get your blood and hormone levels checked for outlier diseases that may make losing weight more difficult or require a more specialised diet. \n\nIi.) Once that's done, evaluate your current lifestyle and be brutally honest about where you can improve. \n\nIii.) Talk to a trainer/fitness coach/ exercise professional about your options with exercise (this is why step i is important because if there are health considerations, then this can be factored in) and work out a good regime of exercise thats intense enough and something that you will hopefully be able to follow through on and create a routine. \n\niv.) Most important step of all, sort out your diet. You don't have to calorie count (although some people find it useful), but if you are overweight, the most common cause is consuming more calories than you need and not supplementing that intake with enough exercise. We all need to eat good clean food and mind our portions to maintain a healthy body. \n\nAll this takes work and isn't easy. It certainly isn't just cutting salt from your diet lol. Hope sone of that is more useful info. Good luck."]}
