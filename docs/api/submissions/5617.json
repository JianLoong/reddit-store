To keep things short and to the point, die to COVID and other factors.. Since dating, and all through our marriage, we lived with other family members. We've never had our own place to be a married couple and be adults. Now as of about 4 months ago, we finally do.\n\nWe got out own apartment and we're excited to be having OUR lives. We decided we wouldn't go to anyone's house for Christmas or holidays and have our own, as our own 2 person family, finally, for once. Every year we've gone to family's house. Hers or mine.\n\nMy wife's sister is the only family she has in the USA beside me. Sister, BIL, and 2 nephews. We are always at their house, or they come to my family member's house, for every holiday. Always every single time.\n\nWe decided that finally since we have our own place and can live our own lives as our own family unit, we'd spend the holidays together with just us two. Meet family later in the week for gift exchange whatever.\n\nWife just spent a whole week camping with her sister and has been back two days only. She forgot to tell the sis we weren't coming until yesterday. Sister is PISSED and flew off the handles and accused her of not caring about her family and only wanting to be around me and that I'm an asshole who is keeping her from her family and forcing her to change her ideas about the holidays. Wife is so drained from taking care of their children for them for a whole freaking week that even if we DID plan on going, she didn't feel like it anymore because she needs a break. \n\nNow I'm the dickhead who's a buzzkill and my wife apparently hates her family and \"chooses\" me over them. In my opinion her sister doesn't consider us two as being a family unit because we don't have kids. They are a Latin culture and have big families and social parties and get togethers and are very outgoing. We are not, that's WHY we get along and got married. I feel like sister considers us part of HER family since there's no way WE can have our own. \n\nI watched their animal for them in the apartment the entire week they were gone. She came to pick up the animal earlier and stood in the parking lot telling at my wife causing a scene. She finally left and told my wife if we don't call her nephews to say Merry Christmas they will \"really know we have chosen to break away from the family\". I feel like they are emotionally manipulative and immature for bringing the kids into this and disrespectful of our intentions to live our own life. But I'm also concerned it's causing issues with her family and I'm going to be seen as the wedge? I don't know.\n\nI feel bad this happened on Christmas Eve as the holidays are now ruined because of her yelling at my wife and berating her and making it seem like they hate me and blame it all on me, etc.\n\nAITA or have OUR boundaries not been respected?\n\nEdit. My family, when told we weren't doing anything except by ourselves, said \"GREAT IDEA you guys deserve it.

You\u2019re NTA but your wife is gonna have to be a big girl and learn to be a team with you. Waiting until the last minute to say something would of course be upsetting. If she would\u2019ve started taking. About it six months ago- they would\u2019ve had time to process and not react so forcefully. Good luck for next year!", "Why do some folks really seem to NOT understand that throwing tantrums & laying guilt trips when they don't get to see people......is just going to drive those people even further away?\n\nNTA. \n\nAnd Merry Christmas!", "NTA.  I would hold the line on setting this boundary.  Regardless of what your SIL thinks about what qualifies as a family, you are adults and can make your own choices about how to spend the holiday.  The audacity of hurling accusations after you and your wife have spent the last week camping/ pet sitting makes me question whether or not your SIL can be reasoned with.  But, no is a complete sentence. \n\nI do think your wife needs to let her sister know that this was a mutual decision.  It\u2019s not right to let all the blame fall on you, and it\u2019s only going to cause more resentment down the line if this point isn\u2019t made clear.", "NTA. Obviously she should call the kids on Christmas because she\u2019s close with them but it\u2019s both of you deciding to celebrate together. You\u2019d be locked in for life if you had given in. They\u2019ll blame you because you are the outsider. It\u2019s up to your wife to make it clear it\u2019s her decision too.", "NTA.\n\nJust check with your wife her input in all her sister said. But, at least as far as I can see, you did nothing wrong. As long as she is on-board, you're in the clear, but wife may need to reinforce some boundaries and clear everything with extended family. \n\nHaving a Christmas alone as a couple is something you deserve. Happy holidays", "Definitely NTA for not going, SIL\u2019s reaction is way over the top. I would maybe understand if she was upset over the short notice, like if she had spent money on food etc expecting for more people, but that does not at all seem to be her issue. I do think it would be nice of you to call and say merry Christmas to the nephews, but her threatening you over it is ridiculous.", "NTA for wanting to be with each other in your own home. But in all seriousness what would be the issue with her calling her nephews to tell them Merry Christmas at some point during the day?", "NTA. Your wife needs to channel her inner Latina all the way and tell her family how it\u2019s going to be going forward, and that that in no way means she\u2019s abandoning her family. Sil is utterly ridiculous in her controlling, scorched earth nature.", "Absolutely positively NTA!! But your wife needs to address this wife her sister than you alone are not making these decisions. Sister sees it that way I think. They\u2019re holiday traditions have changed because you have your own place now and her sister is blaming that on you. Your wife needs to explain that she also chooses to stay home for the holiday and she needs to set & enforce boundaries with her sister. She is being emotionally manipulated as well! There\u2019s no reason you two together or she can\u2019t call her nephew(s) to wish them a Merry Christmas. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with want to spend the holiday together, just the two of you, in your first place together!", "NTA but your wife might be. It was really unfair of her to only tell her sister the day before. It would have been quite a shock and unexpected since it was the first time.\n\nIt's quite common for in laws to blame the person who isn't blood-related, regardless of the circumstances. You're much easier to get mad at than their own flesh and blood", "NTA.\n\nYour SIL is toxic.  She is refusing to even acknowledge your boundaries.  SIL is abusive, manipulative and is very disrespectful toward you both.  Stand your ground here.  Call and wish your nephews a Happy Holidays and then put some distance between you so you all can calm down.  When you both are ready to move forward, make it clear to SIL that neither of you will tolerate being spoken to in that manner nor being called names (calling you an asshole).  \n\nBeing a member of a family doesn't mean you can treat people poorly.  It isn't a sword that you can wave freely to cut people down.  You have to give people a reason to be around you and want to spend time with you.  SIL hasn't figured this out yet.", "NTA. You two have ever right to a quiet day together. Everyone gets nuts around the holidays! She JUST saw her sister!", "NTA.  That being said, you may have to spend time with your ILs this year.  I know your family was cool with the situation.  The problem is that they were warned about the change in plans some time ago.  Your sister didn't communicate the change in plans to her family, which means they already had plans which included you.  They've probably included you in terms of what they plan to prepare for dinner, etc., which means they've spent money they wouldn't have spent if they'd known you weren't coming.  \n\nYour wife's family isn't disrespecting your boundaries because your wife never set any boundaries.  If you must be upset with someone, be upset with your wife.  You told your family.  She didn't tell hers.\n\nBy the way, calling your nephews on Christmas isn't an unreasonable request.  I'll be calling my parents and other family members in a little while.  When I was a kid, we lived in Texas and my paternal grandmother lived in Minnesota.  We called every week (this was back when you still had to pay long distance charges).  We also called on birthdays and holidays.  We would talk for almost an hour on Christmas.  We also called on New Year's Eve.  Just to give you some reference of what's reasonable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You aren\u2019t celebrating the way SIL sees as appropriate. \n\nStick to your guns and have the best Christmas you can with all the drama in the wings. Call family and wish them a Merry Christmas and then get back to celebrating as you choose. \n\nIt gets easier as the years pass.

Family Included.", "You're NTA - but your wife needs to put big girl panties on and tell her family that you're not holding her captive for the holidays, that this was her idea too.", "You're not wrong. I mentioned though that she was probably scared because something like this would happen. That says a lot.", "Because they were raised by people who gave into it.", "That was my mom.  Every phone call would start with a five minute lecture about me being a terrible daughter because I haven't called in a while.  Every conversation could be summed up thusly:  \"I hate you and everything about you, I don't understand why you never visit.\"", "Wife messed up by not saying anything sooner, but I firmly believe she subconsciously didn't mention it because she knew things would blow up. I told her if she was scared of breaching the topic with her sister, that should tell her everything she needs to know about their relationship.\n\nThey are good people, they just are VERY social butterflies with a very strong tie to their cultural celebration styles. My wife and i would not be married if she had those qualities too, because that's not me. We are homebodies.", "Yeah I kind of want the blame, too, to make it easier on her. But then again I don't want to feel perpetually awkward.", "The issue was the sister said \"if\" we don't call the children, etc etc. I think she assumed we were AVOIDING them instead of just wanting our own holiday. So she invoked the nephews as a manipulation? I don't know to be honest. But now she doesn't even want to call them their because it feels like it's a control thing. They told us to call them or we're terrible, knowing full well we WOULD call them because who doesn't call family on a holiday anyway? I really don't know. \n\nI am seeing a lot of NTA but I still feel like since staying home was my idea that my wife was on board with, I started it all.", "You're entirely right. I never thought of it that way. Our boundaries aren't disrespected since there aren't any. Huh. Thank you redditor! Literally didn't cross my mind.\n\nThe nephews thing wasn't that we WEREN'T going to call them. Of course we were. It just seemed weird that she'd make that request as if she was assuming we were going nuclear avoidance versus just wanting to stay home.\n\nGood calls. Appreciate you.", "I agree. But I told her that she was probably putting it off because she knew this would happen. I think it's natural I don't blame her. It does suck but you're right. We just had a video call with the nephews and they seemed ok and laughing and normal (the in law parents, I mean) so maybe it was just a quick lashing out.\n\nI definitely don't feel like the AH anymore.", "But all this did is delay the tantrum and possibly put her sister out a bit in terms of how much food she bought, etc.  These things need to be settled ahead of time, then just don\u2019t entertain the conversation after that. \u201cThis was a joint decision between me and OP. We love you, but it is not up for further discussion.\u201d If her family persists, leave/hang up the phone.", "You know how, when the check engine light comes on, if you deal with it now it's a simple thing to fix but if you leave it 6 months the car blows up (as a hyperbolic example)?

Your wife needs to have your back here and demand that her sister treats you both with respect.  I completely understand wanting to avoid conflict, but you can\u2019t ignore drama when it is at your doorstep.", "Which is why she needs to clear it up now that it\u2019s a joint decision.", "When you do call expect the law firm of Snark, Snide and Shade to appear on the call to prosecute you in the court of family opinion for \"only calling\" and \"not caring enough to be there in person\".\n\nI hear they do a roaring business around the holidays working matters like this.\n\neta: nta. nothing wrong with wanting to spend christmas as just a couple", "100%.
