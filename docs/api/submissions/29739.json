Who knows what kind of limitations there were on booking the venue. Our venue gave us a list of open dates (there were like 3), and that was that. Plus we had my mom's schedule since she helped a lot and we had to work around the timing for our honeymoon... It was bigger than any one family's ability to be there.\n\nYou made an effort to include everyone, but did anyone set such a major restriction? \"School holidays only\"...venues fill up years in advance with teachers trying to book around school holidays, too. I was raised by teachers, I've seen how hard this can be. \n\nYou're allowed to be hurt, it's unfortunate it didn't work out better, but he very likely did not do it to slight you. If you can, try to be happy for them", "Lol. Are you for real??? Are you the bride or the groom? No?? THEN YOU AND YOUR KIDS ARE NOT A PRIORITY. \n\nEntitled people problems\u2026\n\nYTA", "INFO: How recently is \u201crecently?\u201d This post is an almost a word-for-word copy of your post in r/opinionsaccepted from nearly a calendar year ago. Isn\u2019t your brother already married by now, making this a moot question?\n\nETA: Not only a year ago, but also 12 days ago. How many times are you going to ask people this question, OP?", "YTA\n\n\"School holidays only\" is a MASSIVE scheduling restriction.  It's really not reasonable to expect that someone will be able to schedule *their wedding* around *your* kids' school schedule to that degree.  That takes out entire seasons!  By all means, give them your availability.  But you can't be shocked and take it personally if that doesn't work for the couple, and they choose to instead schedule their wedding for a time that works for them as opposed to a time that works for you.  \n\nI highly doubt they excluded you.  You were asking A TON, and it's very likely they just couldn't accommodate your schedule without having to sacrifice too much of what they wanted for their own wedding.  It's like a destination wedding: couples are free to have them, but if that means people cannot attend due to the large ask being made of guests, the couple need to be understanding of that.  Similarly: you are free to request he schedule his wedding around your children's school schedules because you'd like to attend if at all possible, but that's a MASSIVE ask, so if it doesn't work out, you should be understanding instead of shooting petty barbs his way.", "YTA for your mindset. \n\n\u201cI thought it would be a priority for him for us to be there\u201d. - was this the first time you recognized the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you?\n\nIt\u2019s his wedding, he\u2019s excited about it, and you somehow made it all about you. \n\nYour children, his niece and nephew, live overseas. Let\u2019s not pretend he is very close with them. Be real here. Nobody cares about your kids nearly as much as you do. It\u2019s insane to think he\u2019s going to book his wedding around the schedule of children that he likely doesn\u2019t interact with much.\n\nEdit: looking at your post history this happened a year ago. My god, let it go. Get over it.", "Maybe this date is significant for them, maybe there\u2019s some other reason they\u2019ve chosen it: whatever, it\u2019s about them, not you. If you really wanted to support your brother on a day that is supposed to be about him and not you, you\u2019d be willing to go without your family. You\u2019ve got some serious Golden Child vibes going on. YTA.", "YTA, school holidays are a lot to ask for scheduling, and you\u2019re making it about you being snotty with your brother Turn it around, if you really cared about being there, you\u2019d find a way to go without kids and husband", "YTA\n\nYou and your children are, in fact, not the priority in his wedding plans. Your expectations here were laughably high. So sorry that their desires for their wedding don't line up with your schedule but your hurt feelings are not his responsibility.", "YTA you should not have said that. I understand your point and instead of him planning his wedding for whenever you can make it you should be the one trying to make it at any date because well he's your brother and it's his wedding.", "YTA, there is literally no conflict here from your comments, you were not going either way. Nways imagine if your other two siblings also need a special date. It's probably for the best not going", "YTA. You are forgetting that your brother's fiancee also has a family who have to be taken into consideration. Sometimes it is impossible to choose a date that suits everybody. \n\nYes, telling him not to bother sending an invitation was an asshole thing to say. \n\nIt goes without saying that you do have valid reasons for not attending and your brother should not be annoyed if you do not fly overseas for a weekend trip.", "YTA people make weekend trips all the time.  If you don\u2019t want to attend that\u2019s on you. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around your desires AH", "YTA. You have invented a whole scenario in your head and are running with it! You do not know what exactly a person is thinking.", "YTA.  For saying that he shouldn\u2019t even send an invite.\n\nAlso, you say he should make you a priority but it\u2019s his wedding, you should make him a priority.  Either make the effort to go or don\u2019t but don\u2019t act childish about it.", "Unfortunately, YTA. Not for feeling hurt, but for telling him not to invite you.  The whole family doesn't need to be in attendance. A more appropriate response would be, \"I'm not sure we can make it. But I'll discuss with the family about whether or not just I can attend.\"  He and his fiance may have a vision and a location that could only work out for certain dates.  The bride and groom while they may consult family and friends for optimal dates, will never be able to find the perfect date.    If your brother is a priority for you, maybe you should make the effort to attend, with or without the kids.", "Mild YTA. Maybe they had time restraints with jobs as well limited open dates at the venue. It also sounds a bit salty to say don't bother inviting us because we can't make it. Why not just wish him and his bride well. It's not the same as being at the wedding, yet you can celebrate the next time you see him.", "It sounds like you were being an asshole, but not because you can't go to his wedding.\n\nWhy wouldn't you say how sad you were you couldn't come, congrats on choosing a venue so happy for you?  Because you are hurt and meant to be a little mean and passive aggressive.\n\nTime for an honest conversation with your brother about how he hurt you and how much you wish you were at his wedding even though you can't be there on that date, and it makes you sad he couldn't accommodate your schedule.", "Because your brother did not plan his soon to be wife's wedding around the dates that WOULD ONLY WORK FOR his niece and nephew you feel attacked and excluded? \n\nAll because you would use the wedding as an excuse to visit family for an extended period of time. The issue for you is not the kids will come out of school but you would spend all that money just to go to a wedding and that isn't what you want to do. \n\nYour idea of priority is that your brother succumbs to your wishes and not that you for one weekend make it a point to attend to their wishes.\n\n\nNTA for refusing an invitation to a wedding be sent because you can't attend.\n\nYTA because of your whole reasoning quality for why you're not attending.", "YTA;  Only for how you handled it.  If you know you will not be able to make it, respectfully decline, grateful for the invitation.  You were dismissive over your brother not catering to your family's schedule.\n\nInstead of passing on an invitation you couldn't make, you dismissed the gesture.  It will be remembered in the future.", "YTA. There was no need for your passive aggressive guilt trip.  You didn't even consider if perhaps you could go alone.  If not, it is what it is.  Congratulate them and ask for the livestream link to watch the ceremony.", "YTA. No one cares about your kids' school schedules and certainly can't be expected to limit special events for your convenience. You were a massive passive-aggressive AH martyr for telling him not to bother sending you an invite.", "YTA. How many times are you going to post this story and keep getting the same answers? Get over yourself", "Come on, OP, let be honest, you fucked everything in the first place and now just behave like hurted victim. \n\nYou explicitly said in the comments, that you can\u2019t go because of your final exams. It\u2019s reasonable of course. But final exams goes for few weeks at most. And initially you told your brother that your are restricted for your kids holidays. A huge difference, don\u2019t you think so? So in the first place you announce impossible conditions, your brother understands that he can\u2019t match your schedules anyway so he just ignore your wishes. After that you are \u201churt\u201d about that and tell everyone that you can\u2019t go because of final exams. Manipulative and stupid. If you say initially that only few weeks are unavailable for you, I suppose, there was a good chance that you wishes would be taken under consideration. \n\nMoreover, about you kids, let\u2019s also be honest. 1 week vacation and missing school doesn\u2019t affect no the teaching process no their grades. So if it is not a final exams week, they are also easily available. \n\nSo, YTA.", "Urm, I said the exact same thing to my brother for his wedding, only because it wasn\u2019t worth the waste of an invite when it was CF, in Finland and I had nobody to watch my son as any potential childcare would be travelling over there too.\n\nBy the sound of things, you have a partner? if this is correct, why can\u2019t you go? \n\nYou should never expect for yourself and your children to be prioritised for someone else\u2019s special day, and you\u2019re not making him and his day a priority\u2026 swings and roundabouts OP.", "NAH \n\nYou don't know if he was purposefully excluding you or not, so I'm not gonna call him an AH. But also if you can't go, you can't go so might as well not waste the paper sending you an invite.", "NAH:  But I don't get why you are taking this so personal that he purposely excluded you.  Also what would be the problem if just you go and support your brother?", "info - did you ask him if there was a reason that it wasn't in the summer (usual school holiday & popular time for a wedding)?", "NAH\n\nI planned my wedding during school holidays so that my brother would be able to attend. This limited me a lot because there weren't many dates available. In worst case I would have done it without him instead of shifting my wedding a year.\n\nBut one question: Can you attend without your kids? No need to miss the wedding if your partner stays at home with the kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
