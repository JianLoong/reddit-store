A few days ago my neighbor told me that as soon as I leave the baby cries and she cries for hours. My neighbor said that she knocked on our door and he finally answered it. He was sleeping. \nI concluded that he sleeps all day and right. Before I come home he pretends to care for her. I decided to take the day off of work, i left home at my regular time. Waited 30 minutes and then went home. Sure enough he was knocked out sleep with his stupid noise cancelling headphones on. \nI went to my daughters room, scooped her up and took her to my friends house. I waited about 2hours and I finally called him to tell him that I was coming home early. He called me back saying that he can\u2019t find the baby.

At 4 months old your baby is barely out of the newborn stage and still needs to eat every few hours.

I wouldn\u2019t even had phone to warn him, and see how long he would have neglected her.\n\nThen I kick him out of the house. One thing to be depressed, quite another to neglect a baby.

A lot of commenters here aren\u2019t acknowledging that you took your child away from a very dangerous situation. I don\u2019t mean to scare you, but I study child development and this is a situation that has happened and been studied before. Even if babies neglected like this seem to make it through okay, it can affect their development for the rest of their lives IF not corrected for early on. Babies need stimulation, engagement, skin-to-skin contact, people responding to their needs, etc. Even the rhythm of being rocked is crucial for their learning. OP, please look up attachment theory, because it describes how babies can literally grow into adults who don\u2019t trust well or form appropriate social relationships if no one responded to them as babies. \n\nAgain, I don\u2019t say this to scare you or blame you. This isn\u2019t an irreversible thing, and you\u2019re absolutely not at fault here. I commend you for doing everything you can in getting your baby out of there, but letting this go for months longer *WILL produce deficits that affect your daughter for the rest of her life.* People in your life will try to convince you that \u201cit\u2019s okay. She\u2019s obviously fine. He wasn\u2019t doing anything that bad,\u201d but it\u2019s more serious and nuanced than making sure she lives to the end of the day. He\u2019s very seriously neglecting her, and you need to treat this exactly as seriously as your instincts are telling you. \n\nPlease call your pediatrician immediately, tell them the situation, and ask them to ensure that she\u2019s reaching the right weight (if he really wasn\u2019t feeding her all day), developing properly, etc. Likely they\u2019ll tell you that she\u2019s still doing great, but this way, you have eyes on her. The pediatrician will also be a great advocate in the legal system when you have to fight for custody. A mother who takes a child to a doctor immediately after seeing a problem is going to come across way better than the father who caused the problem in the first place.\n\nNTA, but this is beyond Reddit\u2019s pay grade.

In the short term I'd suggest relying more on friends and family when you can but again, don't let him be alone with your daughter. I'm usually want to avoid shouting divorce (unlike most people here on askReddit) but if he doesn't make a good faith effort to change and continues on how he currently is I would strongly suggest you talk to a divorce lawyer.

I do know what a good partner is now that I\u2019ve been through it. My best girl friends, my dear coworkers who had to help me face facts, and my whole life was codependent with that previous partner. \n\nNot everyone who calls for divorce is in a bad relationship, because I, for one, survived it for myself.", "I\u2019m so glad someone posted about this. I\u2019m a child therapist. The impact of broken safety and attachment bonds cannot be underestimated. Fortunately OP can immediately provide a safe and loving environment. This man should never be allowed alone with this child again until significant repair and treatment has taken place.", "I have depression and was diagnosed with PPD after having my son. I definately was as lazy as possible and trying to sneak in extra sleep anywhere that I could, but I still fed him like clockwork, changed him immediately if his diaper was dirty, kept him in clean clothes (he was constantly spitting up so he went through a lot of clothes each day), played with him to the best of my ability (even if that meant laying on the floor while gently pushing his swing or something) read to him, and never ignored his cries. I also did the bare minimum of essential chores, like laundry and keeping the kitchen clean/dishes, took a few months before I was able to do things like dusting or vaccuming but I did everything that was necessary and I still do.\n\nDepressed or not, it's completely monsterous the amount that he is willing to neglect his child.", "I'm really sorry you had to do that while you were that sick. I can believe, personally, that there are people who are SO sick that no matter how hard they try they can't functionally take care of an infant or hold down a job, but what he doesn't get a pass on is saying he'll do it and then not. If he's perking up enough to pretend he's been doing parental things all day right when his partner gets home, he isn't catatonic or anything.", "He called his mommy before calling the cops\u2026.", "At least she wasn't wearing noise cancelling headphones and could hear her child crying for help", "Exactly. He's able to get his lazy butt out of bed in time for OP to come home and seeing him care for his baby for a few minutes to make himself look good. That's being deliberately deceitful. If he was that depressed, he probably wouldn't have the energy to even think of doing that. Plus he never once mentioned to OP anything about being tired or needing more sleep. He did it all behind her back.", "And before calling the mother of the allegedly missing child"]}
