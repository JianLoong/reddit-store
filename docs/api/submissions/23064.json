You like to control everything huh?", "LMAOOOO gottem", "Can you simply link the post? It\u2019s taking me down some rabbit hole of links.", "[Your post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swingers/comments/14g61qv/has_anyone_used_this_site_care_to_share_feedback/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)\n\nI mean, you do you. It just seems odd that someone who posts in r/swingers and has posts asking if other tall read heads are also insatiable would brag about restricting another adult\u2019s life/choices.", "Lol - you are hilarious and grasping at straws. One post asking about a question/suggestion posed to me? I\u2019m literally lol. Bless your heart. \n\nHell yes, I am an insatiable redhead and a HLF. I\u2019m learning more and more about both from Reddit. Societal tropes say women are not allowed to be the HL partner who wants good and vibrant sex\u2026fellow minded women at Reddit tell me that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019ve also only ever been with my husband. \n\nYour clear and intense infatuation with me is\u2026interesting.", "\u201cClear and intense infatuation\u201d... keep coping *eye roll*\n\nI saw a Redditor bragging about restricting their employee\u2019s sex life, so yeah, I clicked to see what kind of weirdo you were. And well, your post history was wide open. \n\nIt\u2019s disappointing for all that \u201clearning\u201d you are doing, you\u2019re unable to reflect on why your attitude/focus on your employee having premarital sex was weird. \n\nBut as I said, you do you. And regardless of the cope and you trying to use boomer rebuttals like you just fired up that AOL disk you got in the mail, the criticism of my original comment, that it\u2019s weird someone active on the swinging Reddit would cast stones, still stands. Or in your style of *zinger* replies bless your little swinger heart."]}
