{"id": 22910, "submission_id": "156uapp", "title": "AITA for telling my brother he can't live with me?", "selftext": "My brother is 26, I am (male) 30 years old. Recently my brother left  my mom's house and he is currently living at my aunt house until the end of this month. Little context my brother is lazy with zero drive to do anything. He lived with me back in 2016 for about two years until I moved to Texas and he moved in with my mother. He is 26 now has been living with her for 4 years and a year with my aunt. My mother has been blowing up my phone because I refuse to let my brother stay at my house. The last time I let him stay I paid for all expenses while he was working and got nothing for it, but his ass to kiss and when I brought the situation to my mother she condoned his actions. (calling it a bad mood, side note my mother has always taken his side no matter what) my last straw was him trying to fight me because I told him I wanted him to move out after constantly paying for his bills and personal items. So after a fight he finally left. 4 years go by and every now and again I'm still paying for something.(she would disguise it has something she needed) That catches us up to this past week. My aunt is moving and she has told my brother he can't come to her new place, that he would have to move out, so he goes to my mother house and that last about 5 days and he leaves because he doesn't like her rules. (Trust me stupid I know) so now he's back at my aunt house a couple days before she moves to her new place. I being the big brother call my grandparents and they give him six months to try and get some money together and move out. I informed him that he would have six months to get his life together (after having 5 years to do so) he send me a sob message back saying it's everyone elses fault that he doesn't have his life together and that's hes basically 26 and homeless. Saying he was promised that his name would be added to the house that my parents bought. Well that didn't happen and he is putting the blame on them.  saying that because they promised him 4 years ago that they would add his name to the title, that's the reason he didn't save up and doesn't have his life together. well Recently my mother asked me why I haven't offered him to come stay at my house. I explained to her that I can't be concerned about him and I can't continue to pay for his expenses and he can't do whatever he wants in my house. Well she didn't like that to much and said that since I have the space and no one is living with me he should be allowed to have my spare room because we are family. I still said no. The last text between me and her was her telling me \"if your brother stops talking to you over this it's your fault\" my response was \"if he stop talking to me over this it says more about him than it does me\". Sorry if this story was all over the place. But that is where we are right now he is currently trying to find a place to live by the end of this month.

He won\u2019t be homeless if your mother will house him as long as he follows her rules. Her house her rules.  I find it strange that it is you duty and responsibility to let him move into your house according to your mother.  Why do you have to put up with what she won\u2019t put up with.", "NTA your brother is a leech. He needs a reality check.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother's story makes no sense.  Even if he thought he would be getting the house, he would still need money for upkeep.  It sounds like he needs a cold splash of reality, which he will very soon get.  I hate to see anyone homeless, but he is 26, an adult, and he needs to take on adult responsibilities.", "NTA, and tell your mom if she\u2019s so concerned about her failed golden child being homeless then put him on the deed like you know she said she would LMAO. And I wouldn\u2019t be concerned about NC or LC from any of them tbh, a peace of mind and space is far greater.", "NTA. Good on you for having, and keeping, reasonable boundaries. This is not your problem.", "NTA OP. Your familial responsibility ends once someone reveals that they will take advantage of you and have no remorse for it. I mean he tried to fight you?? \n\nYou have every right to say no and keep the peace in your home. If everyone constantly takes care of him, he may never learn how to take care of himself. It's sad. And risky. But. he. is. Not. Homeless. He can stay at moms he just refuses to. Well, that's his problem.", "NTA don\u2019t let him live with you. Not even for a short while. He\u2019ll just take advantage and you\u2019ll end up poorer and angrier.", "NTA,\nYour mom needs to take him if she\u2019s so concerned. I\u2019m going to give you some advice here because I\u2019ve lived through a similar experience. Stop helping. Stop calling your grandparents. Stop justifying. Stop asking what he\u2019s going to do. Stay out of it. You\u2019ve said no and 26 is old enough", "NTA. You are doing your brother a favour by forcing him to get his shit together.", "Let him fall.

If you'd wanted children, you would have had them. At least as a father it would be expected that you'd pay their way. Your brother, on the other hand, isn't a child. He is supposedly an adult who should be adulting by now. The usual job, place to live & paying bills. It is not your responsibility to parent your 30 y/old brother. You are not obligated to house, clothe & feed him. \n\nHe needs to get his shit together & figure out.", "NTA. Not at all.", "NTA , Your brother is taking advantage of you , plus your aunt supports it. \n\nYou shouldn't care for anyone if thier USING YOU", "NTA. Sign him up at the YMCA or some other SRO and maybe give him the first month's rent.", "NTA. He's not your problem anymore, unless you choose to allow it. Don't allow it.", "NTA", "I have a brother just like this. He is 43.  He sofa surfs or resorts to being a hobosexual in order to avoid being responsible for himself. As long as someone is willing to house, feed and entertain him, he will not grow up.  I moved out young with no savings at all.  I rented a room - the attic on the bus line and then saved and got my first place.  He is being enabled by your family. Stick to NO. U R nit the AH. I think it is funny that he moved back in with momma but moved right back out due to rules.  He is an adult, not a child. We all have rules we follow even when we own our homes.  That is life.  He is going to have a hell of a time as he gets older.", "Oh, eff no. NTA.  You said all the right things, first and foremost being \"no.\" If your mother wants her golden child to have a home, she can provide it.", "NTA for not letting him live with you, but...\n\nIf the family--you included--stops enabling his mooching, he might have a chance to grow into a functional adult.", "NTA. Looks like litte brother is about to grow up.", "He has a place to live with his Mother. He can learn to live with her rules if he wants a roof over his head. Otherwise, he can get a job, pay rent and live life however he wants.  And thinking he is just going to be handed a house is nuts. He would lose it in a few years to a lack of upkeep and owing back taxes most likely. \n\nTough love is necessary and he needs to grow up, stop feeling sorry for himself, and take responsibility for his actions. He is exactly where he put himself.", "NTA, but your brother might have some real mental health challenges. Your mom mentions his mood, but instead of getting him some health she coddles him in a way he absolutely doesn\u2019t need.  It\u2019s hard being attached to a spoiled asshole with *actual* problems because it\u2019s a mindfuck trying to find out where you should be compassionate and where to draw boundaries, but if you can walk that line, it\u2019s worth it. And if you can\u2019t and just need to save yourself, then do that without guilt. Just remember he\u2019s a human deserving of dignity, but not necessarily your bank account.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
