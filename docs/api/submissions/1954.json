I always check my bag, it's worth the $30 or whatever to check it and not have to think about it again until I pick it up. It also has be benefit of me not having to worry about the size of my toiletries.", "the way she talked about people who weren\u2019t in priority groups showed some serious entitlement", "Yea, I agree. I was AD 10 years, and my BF is AD still. I cannot board early anymore, but he forfeited his group to wait with me. I wouldn't have been upset with him if he told me he was going to board, but I am very happy he waited with me.", "This I can hang with- somewhat. Not, \u201cTotal\u201d No one has mentioned her comment of this was rare for him to do so. So consider there may have been some other underlying issue at hand we may not be aware of. \n\nI\u2019ve read nothing but salty comments towards OP that had nothing to do w what actually happened; folks imposing their own opinions of what\u2019s right for them. \n\nI come from a military family and completely extend compassion and have no qualms about patiently waiting. That said, I hate being around crowds and will gladly jump at a chance to board early, toss on some head phone and listen to some music or a podcast and zone out. And zone out I will. That makes me happy- but that\u2019s me, and I\u2019m not everyone else, that\u2019s my issue. If my partner who I\u2019ve been dating jumped the gun without me, I don\u2019t think it would bend my nose out of shape like OP, but it would be a conversation opener, more of a, \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going, are you ok?\u201d And only because the subtopic is AITA?, the answer be yeah. Compassion is a lesson that needs to be applied to all areas of our lives. It\u2019s a process. \nHappy Veteran\u2019s Day to all Veteran\u2019s. Thanks for serving our great Country!", "People fear gate checking bags for some reason.  I love gate checking!  It's free and I don't have to deal with finding space for my bags.

As a \"seasoned traveler,\" you'd think she'd know that the very last group boarding the plane is all the standby passengers - meaning, FAs, off-duty pilots, and their friends and family. People who I'm sure travel a hell of a lot more than she does.", "I had the same reaction. I went on a weeklong vacation in europe with my friend, but we had separate seats on the flight home. I got off first and waited for her to get off to walk to customs, and she suddenly ditches me for the global entry line. It kind of made me annoyed bc it was like our final leg of the trip, you couldn\u2019t just wait the extra five minutes with me? You\u2019d have to wait for me at the exit anyway.", "One time I was flying with stand by tickets (husband worked at an airline company and we got cheap tickets but they were stand by) \n\nI got on the plane at the very last second. They closed the door behind me. I got to my seat the security announcement was almost finished. The FA was done checking the overhead bins. \n\nBest thing ever. The plane left 5 minutes after I got seated. No wait. No dealing with people", "This is true unless you fly Southworst.  Then it is first come first serve for seating.", "I see this a lot and don't understand. Im an experienced traveler and I prefer to get on in the earliest group possible and don't deal with a lot of people fumbling around in front of me. I put my carryon in the overhead without fighting for space and always have a window seat. \n\nI get in my seat, headphones on, tablet open while leaning against window. I ignore everyone and just focus on my entertainment. I wave off all drinks and food offerings. Just withdraw into my world and any flight under 5 hours usually goes by fast. \n\nWhen the plane lands, it's easy to grab my luggage overhead and  I'm one of the first off and out of there without the crowd in front of me. \n\nThat routine works great for me. Everything on my pace and I don't have to pay attention to anyone or announcements.", "In my experience they valet your bag and it's stored somewhere on the plane and then give it to you when you get out the door. You don't even have to go down to luggage claim at all. So I wait till the last board they valet my bag and I just pick it up when I get off. I never check bags I hate baggage claim and I always use two carry-ons. One that fits under the seat and one that they typically valet.", "Actually no! Haven't encountered that for a few years either, tho I don't fly as often as I used to. I see lots of space since they cracked down on # of carry-ons.", "Yeah, he might need to take future longer breaks by getting on a different flight for the same destination just to avoid drama like this.", "Yeah I can absolutely understand the mild annoyance. It reminds me of a boyfriend of mine who, when we would get home, would pour *himself* a glass of wine and come sit on the couch with me, knowing full well from experience that I would also like one lol. \n\nIt may be eye-roll worthy for not being super thoughtful, but not anger-and-resentment worthy.", "\"It only would have been a couple minutes, but it didn't occur to either of us for him to leave me?\"\n\nYeah, I think this is a key point. It's not that the actual consequence of him boarding 5 minutes earlier was horrible (aside from the fight OP started over it, lol), but it just doesn't seem socially normal to board separately from a partner or even anyone else that you're planning to sit with. I can see how it would kind of be a wtf moment when he walked away from her, especially if he'd never done that before, and I don't blame her for asking him what was up with that. Was it worth a fight? No, probably not, unless it was the last straw in a string of mildly passive-aggressive things he had done to her recently. \n\nJust because something doesn't actually cause you any harm doesn't mean it can't be a bit weird or off-putting. \n\nBut yeah, OP seems like a boarding class snob, which I didn't even know existed. (Like it's not even about being wealthy and affording first class but more about her skill boarding a plane which is hardly a thing. Later classes are usually less efficient because of the way many airlines structure things, not because of passenger incompetence.) And it seems like she overreacted.", "Right! If you\u2019re travelling together, why wouldn\u2019t you board together?! That\u2019s weird.", "Oh yeah that makes sense haha!

Most likely, it wouldn't have been a problem though.", "I love to build a nest", "Misses Dash is too much and it\u2019s salt free", "Used to do it when you had assigned seats. But assigning has a cost so as flights got cheaper, they stopped. And now they have weird mix of assigned and unassigned.

Likely benefits us both as no one going to sit beside him if open row available", "Some of us have pretty much nothing but laptop and camera gear in the carryon and really don't want to (and shouldn't, given lithium batteries) gatecheck.\n\nThat said, I've never needed priority boarding to find bin space, although I do try not to be the last on the plane.", "Yep, I travel with a small duffel that can fit under the seat in front of me or in the gaps in the overhead cabin. \n\nI'm usually the last person to board because I'd rather chill near the gate and stretch out, use a full sized bathroom etc.", "About 50% of the time. I travel on some well\nPacked planes", "I encounter this a lot on cross country flights", "Idk, I\u2019d go with NAH here but it does seem like a petty thing. I love my husband, but we live together and eat together and sleep together and do ALL THE THINGS together so boarding at different times is just not even on the radar of things to get mad about. \n\nI travel for work so I\u2019m often in a higher boarding group than him. Sometimes we wait together for his group or sometimes we just get clowny and I board with my group and make a joke like \u201cbye pleb\u201d. But we\u2019re literally right next to each other within 10 minutes tops so it\u2019s not even a big deal. We have bathroom breaks where we\u2019re apart for longer than that. \n\nI think it\u2019s a silly hill to die on and comes across as a codependency thing. Maybe she has anxiety and I can understand her POV if that\u2019s the case but there\u2019s no info here to support it. OP\u2019s attitude about boarding groups is the most obnoxious thing in the post, as if there\u2019s some sort of social clout that comes with where you board but it\u2019s not outright A H, just na\u00efvet\u00e9 since she\u2019s young.", "Omg, this has always been my favorite Seuss story", "It\u2019s a valid point. \n\nBeing an unseasoned traveler I always have a carry on that fits under the seat.  \n\nThe commuter flight I usually take also gate checks bags that can fit in the overhead bins.

Every slow ass moving tight spends 10 minutes trying to jam their stupid oversized \"carry on\" into the overhead, making it take forever to load. Much better for every single person to spend several embarrassing minutes fighting with their bag instead of just paying to check it.\n\nMake checked bags free and charge for any bag or backpack carry-on that weighs over 10 lbs.\n\nWatch, everyone will suddenly be able to get on and off the plane in 2 minutes. It would allow faster turnaround and more efficient use of staff.", "Her statement that seasoned travelers aren't the ones that board in the main groups really through me off. I'm a VERY seasoned traveler and my boyfriend and I are more often than no the last to board because we hate sitting forever. \n\nBut I also only care if we board at the same time unless my carry-on is too heavy for me to lift. Which only happened once.", "Cause there was a post about the book recently", "When I flew out of Iceland they had literally no groups except first class. It was just one huuuuuuge line stretching through the concourse. Thankfully (I guess) I was close to the front, although we had checked bags so overhead bin space wasn't important to me on that one.\n\nI just flew for work and my coworker gate checked his carryon for our first flight and it was off the plane almost instantly when we landed. That may be the trick to not waiting forever at the baggage claim. Last on the plane, first off the plane."]}
