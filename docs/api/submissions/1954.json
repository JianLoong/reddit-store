Yeah, not a big deal. You made it a big deal.\n\nIt might just come down to him getting some minor recognition in a job that actively eats you up and spits you out in this country.", "Yeah, YTA. He boarded five minutes before you. Be a big girl, let him enjoy the appreciation for what he does for us as a country, and just enjoy your trip.

You have to start a fight over something this petty? You've got problems.", "YTA. How petty.", "YTA. There was no reason to start an argument over this.", "YTA.  If I were him, I would always board ahead of you because I'd need the 10 minute break from your whining and pettiness.", "YTA.  Seriously this is about recognizing who he is.   Military is a big deal.   He is giving everything for our country.   \nTell him thank you from me for serving and let him board as active military!", "YTA. It's such a non-issue and you are kicking a fuss because of who boarded when? As long as you guys have enough space for your luggage in the overhead bin compartment, what does it matter what group you are in?

And since you yourself said it's a 5 minute difference only, why do you feel so bothered?", "ESH you for starting an argument over something so small. He gets a little because he randomly did it and didn't say anything. That is strange", "Yay", "Slight YTA.  Yeah, he could have waited.  That would have been the polite thing to do.  Not an AH move to not, though.  You, however, took it too far by turning it into a whole argument.", "YTA. how dare he board the plane before the Queen. Doesn\u2019t he know he\u2019s just a soldier?", ">He told me that **it wasn't a big deal**, and I said it was since we weretraveling together, he had never done that before, why would he do itrandomly now, and he didn't have a reason besides \"it's for me, whywouldn't I use that group\" even though my group is still consideredpriority boarding?\n\nYTA and this isn't a big deal.  You were seperated for less than five minutes, why is this something you think is worth fighting about?", "What a strange hill to die on, do you have other relationship issues and this was just something to nitpick about? YTA", "YTA. Duhh.", "Last time I flew, the airline was happy to let my partner and I board together in the better zone. Eg I was zone three, they were zone five, and the airline was happy with us both boarding in zone 3.

Reading this was such a waste of time", "ESH it really is not a big deal to board separately, so you probably didn't need to bring it up. Also getting on the plane first isn't a big deal either so he could have waited. \n\nBut the real issue is why are you trying to be first on the plane? You seat is assigned so it doesn't matter when you get on you still sit in the same place. When I travel I wait until the last possible minute to get on the plane. Why would I squish into those tiny seats a moment sooner than I need to.", "YTA.  I'm usually in the second group to be called in, I don't have a problem with it.  The plane still flies, I get to where I'm going.\n\nThe only thing I can assume is that, because you're a Platinum Card holder, you expected to be on the plane before him.

He's Active Duty and they board men and women who are Active Duty first.  Is it really worth starting a vacation in a bad mood?", "YTA\n\nDid you think he'd have a 5 minute affair while he escaped your clutches?\n\nThis is a very odd post.

You sound exhausting to be in a relationship with if this is the level of mad you get over something so small.", "YTA.\n\nI assume it doesn't matter when you board since you have assigned seating.
