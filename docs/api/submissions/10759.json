As a result, Lila stays with me one weekend a month and we watch movies, eat junk food, and practice what I'm learning in an ASL class taught at the deaf community center. She hears some, has a cochlear implant, and lip reads, so even if she's having a device break, we manage fine.\n\nWhen I sign phone, I typically do the Y hand shape ear to mouth, whereas Lila does the newer version, which simply looks like you're holding a cell phone to your ear. Lila constantly teases me to \"come into this century\". So to \"spite\" her, I decided to start using the OLD sign for phone, which looks like you're holding a piece up to your mouth and ear whenever phones come up in conversation (they do when she talks about her friends), and she laughs and calls me an AH everytime, which devolves into, \"I am not!\" \"Yes you are!\" \"Am not!\" without fail.
