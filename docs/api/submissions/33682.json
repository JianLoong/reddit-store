{"id": 33682, "submission_id": "18pmzc7", "title": "AITA for taking my kids away from their grandparents?", "selftext": "For some context: I am 42M and my wife is 39F and we have two kids who are 10M and 7F. My son and daughter are everything for me. However, for the past 5 years or so, since before COVID and a bit after, I worked overseas and I rarely came home(I am a petroleum engineer and work on offshore rigs). I came home maybe 4 times in the past five years, only staying for a week max. My kids basically think of me as a stranger, and that is not their fault, it is mine. But everything I do is to provide for them, and my wife works overtime and I cannot even begin to express how much I appreciate her for that. She has been so understanding. We need the money, hence why I do what I do.\n\nThe issue: I recently came back and switched to an on site desk job, about a month or two ago. My kids are still shy around me, and I want to get to know them better. My kids recently started coming out of their shell, and they usually spend a couple weekends per month at my in-laws place, whenever my wife has to work weekends. My wife had to work this weekend, and told me on Thursday. I asked my kids if they want to spend this weekend with me instead of their grandparents. No pressure of course. I did want to incentivize them staying though, so I promised ice cream after dinner both days, and a fast food lunch(both with my wife's permission). My son accepted immediately, and my daughter had to be bribed with a later bed time on Saturday(wife approved once again).\n\nI just did this because I want to spend more time with my kids. I know I cannot make up for the times I've missed, but I don't want to miss anymore. However, my in-laws called me yesterday and gave me an earful about how I am interrupting their time with their grandkids and how I am breaking their tradition. I told them I just wanted to spend time with my kids, and next time my wife has to work the weekend I will send them over for sure to make up for it. They said I should find my own time to hang out with them and make traditions with them, and not interfere with what's going on. They accused me to bribing my kids for affection(partially true I guess) and for taking their grand kids away from them. They also called me a \"deadbeat\" which I feel wasn't fair since I didn't want to be away, my job made me, and I was constantly sending every penny I could back home. Had my kids still said no, I would've sent them to their grandparents. I did bribe them, but it's just with school and everything, I barely get time with them and weekends are the best. And with my wife on her business trip too, I get one on one time with them. I was just so excited and may have gotten carried away. My wife is going to stay neutral on this, but AITA for interrupting their grandparent time?\n\nEdit: A commenter and others have mentioned my long absence from home and if that was really necessary. I will just add this bit for additional context.  I was working on rigs and for petroleum in the Caucuses. I was in Azerbaijan and Russia most of that time. In Russia, as an American citizen, I was warned that carelessly leaving the country would put me in a terrible position when I try to re-enter the country for my work, due to the geopolitics between Russia and America. In Azerbaijan, I was having visa issues to begin with, and I was advised by an immigration lawyer in Baku to not leave with my visa and stay until the end. The job was paying me a decent amount of money that my family was dependent on. I talked through it with my wife, and she was the one who encourages me to stay and tough it out, and she was my rock. We needed the money for my kids, and my wife's brother-in-law passed away, so we had to help out my wife's sister as well with our nieces and nephews.", "created_utc": 1703390570, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pmzc7/aita_for_taking_my_kids_away_from_their/", "score": 790, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These are your kids!!! I understand why your in-laws would be sad to miss out on their usual weekends, but if they really care about the kids they should be glad you're home and eager to build a stronger relationship with your family.\n\nIf you want to be nice you could suggest the in-laws come hang out with you and the kids so you can both get some fun kid time in, but you're not obligated to, especially if the kids are likely to ignore you in favor of the grandparents in that case. You're already being nice by saying they'll definitely get the next weekend! You're allowed to want to spend time with your kids and you're allowed to make decisions (with your wife) about your kids' schedule.", "NTA. They lost their credibility and any moral high ground they might have had by calling you a deadbeat. You most certainly are not that.", "Deadbeat? NTA and they\u2019re wayyyy out of line", "NTA. You are trying to bond with your children. Your in-laws should be supporting and encouraging that. The compromise you offered was fair. After all, while yes you are home more you still have a job you need to do to provide for your family. The in-laws are being selfish.", "NTA. Plus your wife is staying neutral? Does she feel neutral about you building your relationship with your kids, or does she want it to happen? Because if she wants it to happen, she will need to help by supporting you... including to her parents.", "NTA. Ever. If your in-laws cared about their grandchildren AT ALL they\u2019d be encouraging them to spend more time with you! These are YOUR kids. Do not feel guilty about wanting to spend time with your own children. Your in-laws owe you a huge apology. And your wife needs to demand the apology comes or they don\u2019t get to spend any time with your children.", "NTA. Your children need to KNOW you. The grandparents have been there for the kids and I can see them being hurt and even cautious. You have missed so much you can\u2019t just have that back so time and fun is the best way to bridge the gap", "They are being extremely nasty and insulting, It's unreasonable for them to expect them to have every weekend with the children.\n\nMaybe it's time the family sees the in-laws less If they can't respect you as a father and a provider for your family. \n\nIn-laws fake traditions do not trump a father spending time with their own children. NTA", "NTA- however you should try to establish your own traditions with your kids. Ask them about what they love to do with their grandparents, take notes. Whether it becomes movie nights, board games, sports etc you need to start regular activities and carve out that time together. Be a volunteer at their school or help coach one of their kid's sports/dance/etc teams.", "There are people who live in expensive areas with two (or more) kids and manage to do so, comfortably, without leaving their kids for five years. You chose your career over your family and now you want to play dad. Your kids already have a life and a routine and it\u2019s not fair if you to ask them to change those things for a stranger. \n\nOn the other hand, your in-laws need to understand that you are trying to get to know your children after abandoning them for five years and should be trying to encourage that relationship. \n\nESH because honestly I think everyone is thinking of themselves and not what\u2019s best for the kids and what THEY want.", "It's pretty low to bribe someone to spend time with you.  They are your kids, but if you bribe them to spend time with you, they will expect to be paid every time going forward.  Maybe plan activities with them, that way you actually get to spend time with them.  And I don't buy the only able to come home 4 times in 5 years.  You had something else you felt was more important during that time.  YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes I am also trying to build my own traditions with them. My son is really interested in paintball, so I am trying to connect with him on that front. I already went with him once, and am planning on doing it again, whenever the weather gets better. My daughter is into writing/drawing and keeping a dairy and coming up with stories. So I read her bed time stories and tell her about my time overseas, and that's usually something she enjoys. It's hard but I will try my best to find something that works and stick to it.", "Abandoning the kids.... My goodness you're dramatic... Do you think the same thing of every father in the armed forces or working on oil rigs as abandoning deadbeats!!!\n\nAnd he's not a stranger he is their father who has parental rights over them unlike the in-laws who are now just meddling.", "Valid criticism for the bribing part, I wholeheartedly accept my fault in that.\n\nAs for not buying the fact I wasn't able to come home, that was truly out of my control.
