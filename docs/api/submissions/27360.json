We met in sophomore year of high school and hit it off, which meant we began to hang out outside of school. I started developing feelings for him about a year after we met, and soon found out they were reciprocated.\n\nNow, I know I may sound like the asshole in the vague context of the title: However, I don\u2019t think I am at all. I need some input.\n\nMe and my husband began trying for a baby about 3 years ago: and being unsuccessful multiple times was incredibly deterring. However, about 5 months ago, I found out I was pregnant. To say I was happy is an understatement. My husband seemed ecstatic in due course, his wariness quickly overturned by the excitement of being a father.\n\nMy husband has always voiced how much he wanted a son. During my pregnancy, my husband posted paragraphs about how incredibly thrilled he was to become a father. Although, he seemed to always manage to rope in his hopes of being a boy father into his words. I didn\u2019t necessarily have a problem with it at the time.\n\nAbout 4 months into my pregnancy, my doctor scheduled a gender revealing ultrasound. As always on my appointments, my husband tagged along. As we drove, I took a mental note of his anxious habits. Biting his nails, tapping his hands on the steering wheel, breathing hard. It was understandable. As we arrived, we were whisked away by a doctor to the room.\n\nAs they began the ultrasound, my husbands jitters slowed. My doctor spoke aloud in elated tone: \u201cIt\u2019s a girl! Congratulations!\u201d Dead silence. Without even finishing the appointment, my husband stood up quietly and stormed out. The air was heavy with tension as I cleaned up and headed towards the lobby. I found my husband sitting on his phone in the waiting room, brows furrowed. \n\nHe saw me and forced a smile. As we headed back to the car, I noticed how he avoided my questions. I tried to brush it off, thinking it was just a twinge of quick passing disappointment: however, I soon realized it was much deeper than that.\n\nAs we parked in our driveway, I broke the silence with a considerate \u201cAre you alright?\u201d \u201cDo I look fucking okay?\u201d Hubby says, \u201cYou know how much I wanted to raise a man like my father raised me.\u201d He began raising his voice, each word growing to be painful and cruel.\n\nI was already in pain, exhausted, and frustrated as he spewed several underhanded accusations and unwarranted insults out at me. I snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re already a pathetic excuse of a father and our daughter isn\u2019t even born yet,\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\nHe left quickly afterwords and informed me that he will be staying with a friend for a couple of days. His family has been blowing up my phone with messages I refuse to read, and my own family is telling me that I went too far and should apologize.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my husband that he\u2019s \u201calready a pathetic excuse of a father,\u201d?", "created_utc": 1695346203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oxgmt/aitah_for_telling_my_husband_that_hes_already_a/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
