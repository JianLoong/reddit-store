{"id": 24326, "submission_id": "15ne57c", "title": "UPDATE - AITA for not allowing my stepson(12M) to live with us", "selftext": "For those who want to read the original post, it's available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l42nk/aita_for_not_allowing_my_stepson_12m_to_live_with/).  \n\n\n  \nI initially want to thank the comments that helped me understand that I was in the wrong. I learned that I was being extremely selfish, only looking out for my own children and my fear that they might somehow face bullying at home, but I wasn't considering the feelings of my stepson. I've also learned that the dynamics between siblings, something I never experienced, inevitably involve a bit of competition and rivalry.  \n\n\nI was so focused on myself and my kids that I couldn't see that if he wants to live with us, then obviously he cares about us, especially the idea of having siblings. So, I hope we will work together build a great dynamic in our house.  \n\n\n  \nI talked to my fianc\u00e9, even showed him this Reddit post, and told him that I agree our stepson should live with us, that I was wrong about my reservations concerning the boy.  \nHe talked to the mother of my stepson, who has legal custody of him. I didn't participate in the conversation, as I understand it's a moment for the biological parents. Despite being reluctant, after hearing from her own child that he wanted to live with us, she agreed to work out an arrangement where he will spend a significant amount of time with us. My fianc\u00e9 and boy's mother will still have to discuss the details.   \n\n\nAfter that, my fianc\u00e9 and I took my stepson out to eat his favorite burger and talked. I told him that we're happy to have him as a new member of our household, that we're going to look for a new house to better accommodate the family now that we'll be five, and he can have his own room. He was very happy.  \n\n\n  \nWe didn't address some concerns that I still have, like the issue of discipline and following rules. I avoided that topic so it doesn't seem like I'm threatening him to go back to living with his mom. I want him to feel accepted unconditionally in our home. But of course, we'll have that conversation about discipline with the older two soon to prevent any issues and also emphasize the importance of maintaining good grades in school.  \n\n\n  \nPS.: There's no need for anyone here to send me messages cursing me out. I've received dozens of offensive messages, and it doesn't help anyone. I've also received supportive messages with advice, and I appreciate those messages.  Internet and this community don't need to be a place for hate.", "created_utc": 1691677916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ne57c/update_aita_for_not_allowing_my_stepson12m_to/", "score": 932, "replies": ["As a step parent you need to discuss discipline with your spouse ASAP.

Grades are... less important.", "I am glad to hear that you have made this decision, \n\nEven if you don't want to discuss the issue of discipline at this point with your stepson, I feel strongly that you should discuss it with your husband. We have all heard about bio parents who tell the step parent that they do not have the right to discipline. This puts step parent in a very bad position if they are given no authority. Tell you husband that if you accept this child into your home, you will treat him exactly as you would your own kids and lovingly and fairly provide discipline and make rules as necessary. \n\nIn fact, I would ask your husband to gently warn the child that he would be treated as one of the family, so all the rules and discipline would apply. You are not his mother, but you are the authority figure in this house.", "After you and your husband discuss parenting the blended family and discipline, you should have a family meeting and present it to all the kids as house rules. This way, stepson won't feel singled out. \n\nThen with each instance of bullying or whatever, you address it individually and as privately as appropriate. \n\nAlso, I'm sure you two know, but I would strongly suggest getting the custody agreement and child support amended.", "First of all I want to say that imo you can really take note of someone's character when you see how they react when you tell them they're wrong. And I think your ability to admit you were wrong and immediately adjust your behavior shows that you want to be a good person. \n\nNext, I hope you can tolerate some unsolicited advice. The way my partner and I handle repercussions was that I was able to reinforce immediate consequences. But those consequences would only last until my partner their parent was around. And if he was around when the incident happened he would handle any repercussions. This kept me from being put in the position of being an asshole step parent but also meant that I could do something if one of the kids was being unkind to the other or me or strangers. \n\nSo for example if I was spending the day with them and their dad was at work and one of them picked a huge argument and refused to share the TV I would be able to say \" Okay. No TV (for any amount of time up until their dad got home So it could be a half hour or it could be the rest of the evening). But then when my partner would get home I would let them know what happened and they would go have it chat with their kid and there would be a discussion on whether any repercussions had to last longer than that.", "I love a happy ending", "Make certain to protect your kids, and do not have a kid with fiance until things are better.", "At least many people have sent messages wanting to help, and to those people, I'm grateful.", "I could not agree more! If I am honest, just reading that sentence rubbed me the wrong way. His Dad was his Dad long before she was in the picture and he will always be his Dad. They are becoming a blended family and as you rightly said, it should be \u201cI\u2019m glad that we are all living together.\u201d That young man will always be a member of the family, whether she accepts that or not.", "I never used him as free childcare. I was unfortunate in the example I gave about the bathroom, but I'll explain again what happens.  \n\n\n  \nWe have a young child who's 5 years old. I can't expect a 5-year-old to behave in a mature/appropriate manner at all times, but I can expect the older ones, aged 10 and 12, to understand that the 5-year-old is a little child who doesn't yet grasp various situations.  \n\n\n  \nSo, for instance, if the older two are playing video games for an hour without letting the little one join in, it's obvious they need to stop and let the little one play a bit too. Otherwise, the little one will feel sad and angry, think that his siblings don't like him, and so on. I'm not asking them to play with the little one all the time, but to look at the situation from the little one's perspective so as not to hurt him.  \n\n\n  \nIn the bathroom situation I mentioned last time, it was just me, my stepson, and my youngest son. When my youngest son is with any of the boys, he refuses to go to the bathroom with me. That day, he was practically on the verge of tears not to go with me and wanting to go with his brother. So in my view, my stepson, upon seeing the boy almost in tears over a trivial situation, should have understood he should help to prevent him from actually crying. But he only helped after I insisted a lot.  \n\n\n  \nAnyway, I believe my stepson will grasp this dynamic soon, just like my older son already does.", "She keeps calling him \"The Boy.\"", "I have already discuss about discipline with my fianc\u00e9.  \n\n\nI always believe that when a child is disciplined by a step-parent, they might perceive it as unfair, which can significantly impact the relationship between the child and the step-parent.

She wanted to place some time between the conversations so it didn't come across as a conditional offer ie \"You can live with us if you do A,B & C otherwise we're sending you back\"\n\nThis way she gets to have a conversation with her partner about how discipline will be handled and have the conversation with both older kids so neither feels singled out.\n\nPeople can make mistakes and learn from them. No reason to believe OP isn't one of them.", "Honestly, I think the issue here is just the choice of words. When I said \"member of our household,\" my fianc\u00e9 and my stepson understood that I was referring to him becoming a new resident of the house, as he didn't live here before. Regardless of whether you agree or not, the fact is that he lived at his mother's house and in practice was a visitor at ours.\n\nOf course, I did everything to make him feel that our house was also his, but there's a difference between living here and spending weekends.I never meant to say that he wasn't a part of the family. I've always treated him as a family member.\n\nThis is a part I haven't quite grasped yet. Many people talk as if I treat my stepson poorly. When my husband read the comments on the other post, he told me not to worry, because I treat his son very well, and I think it's obvious that if I mistreated him, he wouldn't want to live with me. So, where does this idea come from that I treat him poorly?  \n\n\nI know that when I said that I didn't want him living with us sounds rude. But there is a huge difference between how you treat a kid and what you discuss with your fianc\u00e9.", "I'm Sorry but your stepson isn't used to have a younger sibling and he doesn't have to act like your older son does. And If he doesn't feel comfortable taking your son to the bathroom, he shouldn't have to. This is an amazing oportunity to teach your youngest boundaries. Reduced your expectations because you are New in your stepson's life.\nIt's not your stepson's job being uncomfortable to please YOUR child and avoid their tantrums.", "You can explain all you want to and the answer is still the same. Take your 5yo to the bathroom yourself.\n\nThe 5yo cries?

It's not hard to see why people didn't make the distinction.", "1. \"Ours\" includes him. It always has, because his father's house is his own house. Maybe, he never lived there but it is still his own house. This is the part you haven't grasped yet.\n2. You were about to treat him poorly for circumstances that weren't his own fault, and for being a 12-year-old child. The purpose of my post was to change your mentality because mentality is the first part of treating a child poorly.\n3. Your behaviour may not be harmful from you or your fiance's POV, aka from an adult's perspective. But a child's perspective is very different and very insightful. Maybe your stepson noticed something bad, but brushed it under the rug. It may have been insidiously harmful, disguised as benign. After all, not wanting your stepson living with you over something that all children do, is pretty insidious and harmful to me.", "I understand that in the last post. If you look at my last sentence, I said that my stepson will learn how to be a big brother and I will have patience.  \n\n\nAnd yes, I need to talk with the little one. That is a long education process", "It's still his own house' \u2013 I completely agree with this, which is why I mentioned that I did everything to make him feel like the house was his too. But there's an aspect I didn't mention, and perhaps it's another reason for my choice of words: my fianc\u00e9 is moving into the house I live in with my kids, so chronologically, it makes sense for me to refer to it as 'my house' and say that my stepson is a new member of it.  \n\n\n  \nOf course, from his perspective, we are the new members of his family.  \n\n\n  \n'Child's perspective is very different and very insightful.' Yes, that's true. The best I can do is treat my stepson the same way I treat my own children, and I don't believe there have been any instances where I treated him differently. In fact, I realized I was expecting behaviors from him similar to those of my older son, without considering his different experiences, which made me unfair to him.", "Yes, but you need to adjust your expectations.

Adjusting to a blended family is difficult for everyone.  \n\n* My father passed away when I was young, and when my mom remarried, I went from being the oldest of 2 kids to being the second youngest of 4 kids.  It was an adjustment for everyone, especially my brother, who now had to share his bedroom with our step-brother.  Sharing the bathroom was a train-wreck, and there were lots of arguments because my step-siblings had 2 houses and their mom had no rules, whereas there were definitely rules at our house.  We got through it a day at a time just fine.  You will too.\n* As an adult now, I have a blended family.  I have 2 kids, my husband has 1.  The two girls are 2 weeks apart in age, so we joke that they're step-twins.  It's been fine, no issues at all, except that the girls are both 19 and we barely see my step-daughter.  It's like pulling teeth to see her because she lives 30 min away and works an additional 30 min away from there in the other direction.  My kids have had an adjustment having a different man as a parental figure, and he's adjusting to having kids around more and the general chaos that comes with my son.\n\nJust remember that everyone is part of your family.  Your heart grows to size of your family, and so does the amount of love you have to give.  Ignore the ugly people on here who won't give you a break when you talk about the changes you're making.

It takes a strong character to do what you did and decide to grow/learn from it. Good luck to your new blended family!", "Since you are now welcoming him into your home, be careful about preferential treatment. Kids are very sensitive to favoritism and since he is not your biologically child, that insecurity will be doubled. He has already been made to feel like he is the outsider. He could easily accept you as family, but that all depends on if you are willing to put in the work and start thinking about how to make things more equal.\n\nOne great example I have is my grandparents always made sure to spent the same amount of money on Christmas gifts and have equal amount of presents. If one kid got a big expensive present, then the others got 5 medium presents and the one with the big presents got 4 additional cheap presents. It allows the kids to never feel overlooked. Both of them were not their parents\u2019 favorite, and that kind of conditional affection sticks with somebody for the rest of their lives.\n\nThis is not to say you are being exclusionary, just something to keep in mind as you work towards a harmonious blended household.", "This update still sounds very much like you're viewing your stepson as an outsider and not part of your family. You keep talking about your children as if your stepson is not one of your children now.

Thanks for sharing!", "I think you have an excellent plan! Something I used to do when I did group therapy with younger kids was establish group rules together. Everybody got to make their own rule, \"be respecful,\" \"no spitting,\" \"don't call me JJ\" (specific, but you got it kid), etc., then we all signed it and I would hang it on the wall during group. The kids felt empowered because they had a hand in making the rules and it was a lot easier to reference our group rules if things got rowdy instead of simply using my authority to gain compliance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you can involve your kiddos in some way, even if it's not creating a rule, but just helping you type them up or drawing them on some paper, it may save you some headache when the inevitable happens and they break a rule.

Step parent when in charge if kids alone would tell kids what to do.  If kids did not comply, they went to their room without electronics or TV and waited for parent to get home.  Parent would come home and back up step parent and tell the kid to do what they were told.  Any debate about what kids should or should not be doing was discussed privately later, out of earshot of kids.  Step parent then doesn\u2019t give out punishment, but the kid learns that they can either do it now or do it later.

I completely agree that it's crucial for children of divorced parents to understand that they have two homes and to have their personal belongings in both.  \nThe thing is, we've been gradually adapting over time.  \nFirst, I got to know my stepson, then he got to know my kids, and then they started spending more time together, until it got to the point where he practically spends every weekend here (even though legally, my fianc\u00e9 only has custody every other weekend).  \n\n\n  \nHe always had his things at his dad's house.

It's not as simple as adding another person to the household, especially when we're talking about caring for another child.  \n\n\n  \nSo, the first thing the OP has to weigh is the relationship among the children. Imagine, hypothetically, if the fianc\u00e9's son were a severe bully mistreating the OP's children. Should she accept that scenario without any conditions just because he's her stepson? She was concerned about her children possibly facing challenges in this unforeseen family configuration, as the stepson wouldn't be there all the time in the previous configuration.  \n\n\n  \nAnother aspect she had to contemplate is the living space. She mentioned that they're planning to move to a new house to accommodate the boy. What if she couldn't afford to move or there wasn't enough space? In that case, would it be wrong or unrealistic for her to say that the boy couldn't live with them?  \n\n\n  \nThis oversimplification that just because someone is a stepchild, the step-parent should automatically accept them living together, is more of a moral assertion than necessarily something practical in real life.  \n\n\n  \nOf course, if the boy didn't have anywhere else to go, it wouldn't even be a question of whether he should live with the OP and her fianc\u00e9.", "I\u2019m rooting for you OP!

It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist.", "I read the whole story, and I didn't find it strange.  \nWhen the fianc\u00e9 and she decided to get married, the fianc\u00e9's son would live with his mother.  \nFrom the moment he asked to live with them, there's a whole new setup that needs to be discussed.  \n\n\n  \nFor example, they decided to move to a bigger house.  \n\n\n  \nIn other words, the new arrangement has many new aspects that need to be considered.", "Just so you realize this is also a two way street. Your new husband will have input and responsibilities dealing with your children. It\u2019s going to be new to everyone, just don\u2019t get upset when an argument starts and either of you hear \u201c you\u2019re not my real mom\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re not my real dad\u201d. Good luck, \ud83d\udc4d", "I was disturbed when I read the original post that OP felt that \"struggling academically and facing minor behavioral challenges\" made her stepson a \"potential negative influence\", and this update has not reassured me that OP has a healthy understanding of grades and childish misbehavior.", "Considered yes but my son is my responsibility. If he decided to live with me and his mom agreed or he was of an age he didn\u2019t need her agreement. I wouldn\u2019t tell him know because he is my son.", "nah but like, imagine if the stepson was actually hitler", "OB23t24's account was made a day ago. Definitely OP undercover \ud83d\ude02", "OH Jesus it just clicked. The objection was to OP\u2019s phrasing because it made it sound like she, not her stepson, was her husband\u2019s primary family.\n\nI totally understand what the other poster meant now, thank you.", "Yes, I know what OP is saying. It was the other commenter\u2019s post that was sitting strangely with me.", "Thank you. I'll try to always keep that in mind.", "Gotta be! I can\u2019t think of another person calling them the boy lol", ">Let me ask you. Do you believe that a bed is very important?\n\nlet me ask you - how would you feel if your husband made you sleep on a mattress in your bedroom?", "He wants a blended family, you don't want the same. He doesn't have a place in your house, you don't want to give it to him, you talk about him as if he's a burden, I feel sorry for this child who has to deal with a stepmonster. \n\nI hope his bio mom reassure him he has a place (a real home where he's loved) to go back when you kick him out due your selfishness, immaturity and lack of communication.", "Are you kidding me? Do you hear yourself right now? No, clearly a bed and a sense of belonging and having their own space for a child isn\u2019t important. /s in case that wasn\u2019t obvious.", "Thanks for the advice. I was unsure if it was worth making these changes since we'll be moving next week, but I think it's worth it even if it's just for an improvement in my future stepson's morale.", "op hasn't learned shit", "I wrote it in a way that allowed for misunderstandings. I meant to ask if the bed is very important right now, given that we'll be moving in the next few weeks.  \n\n\n  \nOf course, having a bed is important, so much so that we'll be setting up an entire room for it.", "Thanks for the advice.

If it's a month or more, my God buy him a bed. If it's less, still take him to pick out his own bed within the next few weeks.", ">I meant to ask if the bed is very important right now, given that we'll be moving in the next few weeks.\n\nagain - how would you feel if your husband made you sleep on a mattress in your bedroom **right now** even though you're moving in a few weeks", "Kudos for posting and following up with real introspection instead of just digging in. NLTA (No Longer The Asshole) with bonus points for caring about a kid who just wants to be happy.", "I\u2019m glad you learned. It\u2019s not going to be an east path, but it could definitely be very rewarding if you approach it fairly and with love.", "Happy to hear things worked out for you guys", "I see a lot of people still giving OP advice. I'm sure it's all very good advice, but OP if you're reading this, good on you for acting on the advice you were given.  \nRegardless of how the future goes, that is a noble and admirable thing, and reading this has honestly given me hope for the future.", "Good on you for choosing to accept your stepson and recognizing your mistakes. Now stop engaging with toxic redditors that are combing through each sentence and expect perfection. It's just a bunch of people sniffing their own farts. You're working on improving the situation for everyone. You're not a monster and any verbal abuse through DM's, you did not deserve. This is a good update that people need to take at face value.", "Remember not to assume your step son is always the cause of every problem.", "Yes", "It doesn't seem likely as she literally has spoken about him as if he is the worst person to grace the earth.", "this is a great plan. one of the hardest parts of a blended family is unbiased, consistent discipline/correction and can (as in my case) even lead to divorce when one parent clearly favors their child and is harsh on their steps. \n\nbut given the amount of personal reflection, growth, and general shift in perspective that is evident between your first and second post, i am sure you guys will move forward thoughtfully, wisely, and carefully. \n\ni am so so so happy to read this update!", "I never said that. I even explained that I didn't bring up discipline during our conversation to avoid him thinking he could be sent back to his mom if he didn't follow the rules.  \n\n\n  \nHe doesn't have to get straight A's, but I do expect a commitment to his studies. We'll have designated study times, and I hope they dedicate themselves to it wholeheartedly.  \n\n\nHis behavior, not just his grades, hasn't been good according to his dad. I hope we can change his attitude by emphasizing the importance of education in a person's life.", "> Do you believe that a bed is very important? \n\nIf you're in the US, yes. It's no longer customary for children to share beds in the US, so I think it *is* important to find a way to get each child their own individual, *permanent* sleeping arrangement that isn't notably different from everybody else's. That is, if *everybody in the house* sleeps on a futon, it's okay for the stepson to sleep on one too. But if *everybody on the house* sleeps on a bed, the stepson should have a bed if it's at all possible to swing it - and if it's not possible now, then funding for a proper bed should be made a top priority, with the understanding that the temporary situation is *temporary*.", "\"you don't want to give it to him\"  \n\n\nI have already said that we'll move to provide a room for him.", "It is obvious. I wrote in some way that I understand many people didn't understand, but I explained in the edit.", "I completely agree with you. I phrased the previous question very poorly, which led to confusion.  \n\n\nI asked about the bed because we'll be moving soon. So, I wasn't sure whether to buy it now or wait until we move.  \n\n\nWe're moving because we want that each child has their own room."]}
