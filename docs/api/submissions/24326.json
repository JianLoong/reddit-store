{"id": 24326, "submission_id": "15ne57c", "title": "UPDATE - AITA for not allowing my stepson(12M) to live with us", "selftext": "For those who want to read the original post, it's available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l42nk/aita_for_not_allowing_my_stepson_12m_to_live_with/).  \n\n\n  \nI initially want to thank the comments that helped me understand that I was in the wrong. I learned that I was being extremely selfish, only looking out for my own children and my fear that they might somehow face bullying at home, but I wasn't considering the feelings of my stepson. I've also learned that the dynamics between siblings, something I never experienced, inevitably involve a bit of competition and rivalry.  \n\n\nI was so focused on myself and my kids that I couldn't see that if he wants to live with us, then obviously he cares about us, especially the idea of having siblings. So, I hope we will work together build a great dynamic in our house.  \n\n\n  \nI talked to my fianc\u00e9, even showed him this Reddit post, and told him that I agree our stepson should live with us, that I was wrong about my reservations concerning the boy.  \nHe talked to the mother of my stepson, who has legal custody of him. I didn't participate in the conversation, as I understand it's a moment for the biological parents. Despite being reluctant, after hearing from her own child that he wanted to live with us, she agreed to work out an arrangement where he will spend a significant amount of time with us. My fianc\u00e9 and boy's mother will still have to discuss the details.   \n\n\nAfter that, my fianc\u00e9 and I took my stepson out to eat his favorite burger and talked. I told him that we're happy to have him as a new member of our household, that we're going to look for a new house to better accommodate the family now that we'll be five, and he can have his own room. He was very happy.  \n\n\n  \nWe didn't address some concerns that I still have, like the issue of discipline and following rules. I avoided that topic so it doesn't seem like I'm threatening him to go back to living with his mom. I want him to feel accepted unconditionally in our home. But of course, we'll have that conversation about discipline with the older two soon to prevent any issues and also emphasize the importance of maintaining good grades in school.  \n\n\n  \nPS.: There's no need for anyone here to send me messages cursing me out. I've received dozens of offensive messages, and it doesn't help anyone. I've also received supportive messages with advice, and I appreciate those messages.  Internet and this community don't need to be a place for hate.", "created_utc": 1691677916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ne57c/update_aita_for_not_allowing_my_stepson12m_to/", "score": 48, "replies": ["As a step parent you need to discuss discipline with your spouse ASAP. You both need to be on the same page when it comes to basic disciplinary measures or it can cause problems in your relationship too.", "Happy to hear that everything worked out for the best.\n\nAnd I think your decision to not mix the moving in discussion with the behaviour discussion was very wise. That discussion need to happen of course, but in due time and has nothing to do with him moving in. Good for you!", "I'm really happy you've had a change of heart and listened to everyone on the previous post.\n\nAs a step parent if i can give you any advice its this - you've got to treat (and try  to love) you're step kids like they're your own. Fight for them just as hard and always treat them the way you'd want your bio to be treated. \n\nIf your ever in a situation where you think \"oh, but he's not mine/my SO is his dad so I can't really say or dp anything\" those are the times you need to step up and **do** the thing the most. Your step kid will respect you for it too.\n\n>we'll have that conversation about discipline with the older two soon to prevent any issues and also emphasize the importance of maintaining good grades in school. \n\nIts a great idea to talk to them together and I'd spend time working with them to establish the house rules too.\n\nI've found the support on the step parents sub invaluable when things have been rough. Just be aware its a sub where people can vent, so sometimes things posted there aren't ideal, but it's a great place to get support.", "I\u2019m sorry people actually messaged you. Commenting on the post is enough. People here preach being morally higher than people but do shit like that???

Here you said:\n\n>I told him that we're happy to have him as a new member of our household\n\nRemember that he was always a member of *the* household because your fianc\u00e9 was/is **his father** **first**, 12 years before you were in the picture. **You and your children** are the new members of **his** household.\n\nOne of the first things to clarify with him instead of your stepson being a \"new member\" of the household, say to your stepson that \"I am happy we are all living together, now\". Word phrasing counts.\n\nI really hope you remember this, or he will always be an outsider in \"your\" household and heart.

Everyone is short sided sometimes.  The important thing is you were able to listen to the opinion of others and look outside of your own opinion.  Most people will just dig in and die on their hill.  Good luck to your family!", "I'm so glad you worked through this. It takes a strong person to admit they were wrong and to rectify the situation.

This issue has always been one of the key points for me.  \n\n\n  \nI always believe that when a child is disciplined by a step-parent, they might perceive it as unfair, which can significantly impact the relationship between the child and the step-parent. However, we've discussed making a list of rules and the corresponding consequences for breaking each rule, so I hope that no one feels unjustly treated. If something comes up that isn't on the list, then the decision will need to be a joint one between me and my fianc\u00e9.", "Came in to say this very thing.  \n\nHe's not new!
