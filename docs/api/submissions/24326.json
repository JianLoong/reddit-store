{"id": 24326, "submission_id": "15ne57c", "title": "UPDATE - AITA for not allowing my stepson(12M) to live with us", "selftext": "For those who want to read the original post, it's available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l42nk/aita_for_not_allowing_my_stepson_12m_to_live_with/).  \n\n\n  \nI initially want to thank the comments that helped me understand that I was in the wrong. I learned that I was being extremely selfish, only looking out for my own children and my fear that they might somehow face bullying at home, but I wasn't considering the feelings of my stepson. I've also learned that the dynamics between siblings, something I never experienced, inevitably involve a bit of competition and rivalry.  \n\n\nI was so focused on myself and my kids that I couldn't see that if he wants to live with us, then obviously he cares about us, especially the idea of having siblings. So, I hope we will work together build a great dynamic in our house.  \n\n\n  \nI talked to my fianc\u00e9, even showed him this Reddit post, and told him that I agree our stepson should live with us, that I was wrong about my reservations concerning the boy.  \nHe talked to the mother of my stepson, who has legal custody of him. I didn't participate in the conversation, as I understand it's a moment for the biological parents. Despite being reluctant, after hearing from her own child that he wanted to live with us, she agreed to work out an arrangement where he will spend a significant amount of time with us. My fianc\u00e9 and boy's mother will still have to discuss the details.   \n\n\nAfter that, my fianc\u00e9 and I took my stepson out to eat his favorite burger and talked. I told him that we're happy to have him as a new member of our household, that we're going to look for a new house to better accommodate the family now that we'll be five, and he can have his own room. He was very happy.  \n\n\n  \nWe didn't address some concerns that I still have, like the issue of discipline and following rules. I avoided that topic so it doesn't seem like I'm threatening him to go back to living with his mom. I want him to feel accepted unconditionally in our home. But of course, we'll have that conversation about discipline with the older two soon to prevent any issues and also emphasize the importance of maintaining good grades in school.  \n\n\n  \nPS.: There's no need for anyone here to send me messages cursing me out. I've received dozens of offensive messages, and it doesn't help anyone. I've also received supportive messages with advice, and I appreciate those messages.  Internet and this community don't need to be a place for hate.", "created_utc": 1691677916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ne57c/update_aita_for_not_allowing_my_stepson12m_to/", "score": 177, "replies": ["As a step parent you need to discuss discipline with your spouse ASAP.

That discussion need to happen of course, but in due time and has nothing to do with him moving in. Good for you!", "I'm really happy you've had a change of heart and listened to everyone on the previous post.\n\nAs a step parent if i can give you any advice its this - you've got to treat (and try  to love) you're step kids like they're your own. Fight for them just as hard and always treat them the way you'd want your bio to be treated. \n\nIf your ever in a situation where you think \"oh, but he's not mine/my SO is his dad so I can't really say or dp anything\" those are the times you need to step up and **do** the thing the most. Your step kid will respect you for it too.\n\n>we'll have that conversation about discipline with the older two soon to prevent any issues and also emphasize the importance of maintaining good grades in school. \n\nIts a great idea to talk to them together and I'd spend time working with them to establish the house rules too.\n\nI've found the support on the step parents sub invaluable when things have been rough.

Here you said:\n\n>I told him that we're happy to have him as a new member of our household\n\nRemember that he was always a member of *the* household because your fianc\u00e9 was/is **his father** **first**, 12 years before you were in the picture. **You and your children** are the new members of **his** household.\n\nOne of the first things to clarify with him instead of your stepson being a \"new member\" of the household, say to your stepson that \"I am happy we are all living together, now\". Word phrasing counts.\n\nI really hope you remember this, or he will always be an outsider in \"your\" household and heart.

Everyone is short sided sometimes.  The important thing is you were able to listen to the opinion of others and look outside of your own opinion.  Most people will just dig in and die on their hill.  Good luck to your family!", "I'm so glad you worked through this. It takes a strong person to admit they were wrong and to rectify the situation. I wish the best for you and all your family.", "Glad it worked out :) but talk with your spouse about some rules. Be a Team. Also, it shows hin you are interested in making this work ;) \n\nAnd yeah, forget the trolls.", "I bet a whole dollar that she threatens to send him back to his mother's house the first second he steps out of line though.", "I'm aware of that. This issue has always been one of the key points for me.  \n\n\n  \nI always believe that when a child is disciplined by a step-parent, they might perceive it as unfair, which can significantly impact the relationship between the child and the step-parent. However, we've discussed making a list of rules and the corresponding consequences for breaking each rule, so I hope that no one feels unjustly treated. If something comes up that isn't on the list, then the decision will need to be a joint one between me and my fianc\u00e9.", "Came in to say this very thing.  \n\nHe's not new!

Wishing the best for you and your new family!", "> But of course, we'll have that conversation about discipline with the older two soon to prevent any issues and also emphasize the importance of maintaining good grades in school. \n\nLearning is important. Grades are... less important.", "I am glad to hear that you have made this decision, \n\nEven if you don't want to discuss the issue of discipline at this point with your stepson, I feel strongly that you should discuss it with your husband. We have all heard about bio parents who tell the step parent that they do not have the right to discipline. This puts step parent in a very bad position if they are given no authority. Tell you husband that if you accept this child into your home, you will treat him exactly as you would your own kids and lovingly and fairly provide discipline and make rules as necessary. \n\nIn fact, I would ask your husband to gently warn the child that he would be treated as one of the family, so all the rules and discipline would apply. You are not his mother, but you are the authority figure in this house.", "After you and your husband discuss parenting the blended family and discipline, you should have a family meeting and present it to all the kids as house rules. This way, stepson won't feel singled out. \n\nThen with each instance of bullying or whatever, you address it individually and as privately as appropriate. \n\nAlso, I'm sure you two know, but I would strongly suggest getting the custody agreement and child support amended.", "First of all I want to say that imo you can really take note of someone's character when you see how they react when you tell them they're wrong. And I think your ability to admit you were wrong and immediately adjust your behavior shows that you want to be a good person. \n\nNext, I hope you can tolerate some unsolicited advice. The way my partner and I handle repercussions was that I was able to reinforce immediate consequences. But those consequences would only last until my partner their parent was around. And if he was around when the incident happened he would handle any repercussions. This kept me from being put in the position of being an asshole step parent but also meant that I could do something if one of the kids was being unkind to the other or me or strangers. \n\nSo for example if I was spending the day with them and their dad was at work and one of them picked a huge argument and refused to share the TV I would be able to say \" Okay. No TV (for any amount of time up until their dad got home So it could be a half hour or it could be the rest of the evening). But then when my partner would get home I would let them know what happened and they would go have it chat with their kid and there would be a discussion on whether any repercussions had to last longer than that.", "I love a happy ending", "Make certain to protect your kids, and do not have a kid with fiance until things are better.", "At least many people have sent messages wanting to help, and to those people, I'm grateful.", "I could not agree more! If I am honest, just reading that sentence rubbed me the wrong way. His Dad was his Dad long before she was in the picture and he will always be his Dad. They are becoming a blended family and as you rightly said, it should be \u201cI\u2019m glad that we are all living together.\u201d That young man will always be a member of the family, whether she accepts that or not.", "I never used him as free childcare. I was unfortunate in the example I gave about the bathroom, but I'll explain again what happens.  \n\n\n  \nWe have a young child who's 5 years old. I can't expect a 5-year-old to behave in a mature/appropriate manner at all times, but I can expect the older ones, aged 10 and 12, to understand that the 5-year-old is a little child who doesn't yet grasp various situations.  \n\n\n  \nSo, for instance, if the older two are playing video games for an hour without letting the little one join in, it's obvious they need to stop and let the little one play a bit too. Otherwise, the little one will feel sad and angry, think that his siblings don't like him, and so on. I'm not asking them to play with the little one all the time, but to look at the situation from the little one's perspective so as not to hurt him.  \n\n\n  \nIn the bathroom situation I mentioned last time, it was just me, my stepson, and my youngest son. When my youngest son is with any of the boys, he refuses to go to the bathroom with me. That day, he was practically on the verge of tears not to go with me and wanting to go with his brother. So in my view, my stepson, upon seeing the boy almost in tears over a trivial situation, should have understood he should help to prevent him from actually crying. But he only helped after I insisted a lot.  \n\n\n  \nAnyway, I believe my stepson will grasp this dynamic soon, just like my older son already does.", "She keeps calling him \"The Boy.\"", "I have already discuss about discipline with my fianc\u00e9.  \n\n\nI always believe that when a child is disciplined by a step-parent, they might perceive it as unfair, which can significantly impact the relationship between the child and the step-parent. However, we've discussed making a list of rules and the corresponding consequences for breaking each rule, so I hope that no one feels unjustly treated. If something comes up that isn't on the list, then the decision will need to be a joint one between me and my fianc\u00e9.", "I can't have the same rules for 5 yo and 10yo. They are at completely different level of maturity.  \n\n\nBut I will talk with 10yo and 12yo together because they are under the same rules.", "There's no reason to think that. She wanted to place some time between the conversations so it didn't come across as a conditional offer ie \"You can live with us if you do A,B & C otherwise we're sending you back\"\n\nThis way she gets to have a conversation with her partner about how discipline will be handled and have the conversation with both older kids so neither feels singled out.\n\nPeople can make mistakes and learn from them. No reason to believe OP isn't one of them.", "Honestly, I think the issue here is just the choice of words. When I said \"member of our household,\" my fianc\u00e9 and my stepson understood that I was referring to him becoming a new resident of the house, as he didn't live here before. Regardless of whether you agree or not, the fact is that he lived at his mother's house and in practice was a visitor at ours.\n\nOf course, I did everything to make him feel that our house was also his, but there's a difference between living here and spending weekends.I never meant to say that he wasn't a part of the family. I've always treated him as a family member.\n\nThis is a part I haven't quite grasped yet. Many people talk as if I treat my stepson poorly. When my husband read the comments on the other post, he told me not to worry, because I treat his son very well, and I think it's obvious that if I mistreated him, he wouldn't want to live with me. So, where does this idea come from that I treat him poorly?  \n\n\nI know that when I said that I didn't want him living with us sounds rude. But there is a huge difference between how you treat a kid and what you discuss with your fianc\u00e9.", "I'm Sorry but your stepson isn't used to have a younger sibling and he doesn't have to act like your older son does. And If he doesn't feel comfortable taking your son to the bathroom, he shouldn't have to. This is an amazing oportunity to teach your youngest boundaries. Reduced your expectations because you are New in your stepson's life.\nIt's not your stepson's job being uncomfortable to please YOUR child and avoid their tantrums.", "You can explain all you want to and the answer is still the same. Take your 5yo to the bathroom yourself.\n\nThe 5yo cries? Who\u2019s the parent here?", ">So in my view, my stepson, upon seeing the boy almost in tears over a trivial situation, should have understood he should help to prevent him from actually crying. But he only helped after I insisted a lot.\n\nOr... you could have taken him to the bathroom, yourself.", "You may not treat him poorly, but you certainly spoke of him poorly in the original post. It's not hard to see why people didn't make the distinction.", "1. \"Ours\" includes him. It always has, because his father's house is his own house. Maybe, he never lived there but it is still his own house. This is the part you haven't grasped yet.\n2. You were about to treat him poorly for circumstances that weren't his own fault, and for being a 12-year-old child. The purpose of my post was to change your mentality because mentality is the first part of treating a child poorly.\n3. Your behaviour may not be harmful from you or your fiance's POV, aka from an adult's perspective. But a child's perspective is very different and very insightful. Maybe your stepson noticed something bad, but brushed it under the rug. It may have been insidiously harmful, disguised as benign. After all, not wanting your stepson living with you over something that all children do, is pretty insidious and harmful to me.", "I understand that in the last post. If you look at my last sentence, I said that my stepson will learn how to be a big brother and I will have patience.  \n\n\nAnd yes, I need to talk with the little one. That is a long education process", "It's still his own house' \u2013 I completely agree with this, which is why I mentioned that I did everything to make him feel like the house was his too. But there's an aspect I didn't mention, and perhaps it's another reason for my choice of words: my fianc\u00e9 is moving into the house I live in with my kids, so chronologically, it makes sense for me to refer to it as 'my house' and say that my stepson is a new member of it.  \n\n\n  \nOf course, from his perspective, we are the new members of his family.  \n\n\n  \n'Child's perspective is very different and very insightful.' Yes, that's true. The best I can do is treat my stepson the same way I treat my own children, and I don't believe there have been any instances where I treated him differently. In fact, I realized I was expecting behaviors from him similar to those of my older son, without considering his different experiences, which made me unfair to him.", "Yes, but you need to adjust your expectations. He is going to be a big brother, but not the way your oldest is. People are diferent! It Just sounded like you expect he'll act like your oldest. How your oldest act when the baby is excluded from playing?", "Thank you for clarifying, It makes more sense. Going back to my previous point, change your turn of phrase because an adult may not bat an eyelash, but it may hurt a child's feelings, looking back.", "\"you need to adjust your expectations\"  \n\n\nYou are correct."]}
