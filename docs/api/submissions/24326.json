{"id": 24326, "submission_id": "15ne57c", "title": "UPDATE - AITA for not allowing my stepson(12M) to live with us", "selftext": "For those who want to read the original post, it's available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l42nk/aita_for_not_allowing_my_stepson_12m_to_live_with/).  \n\n\n  \nI initially want to thank the comments that helped me understand that I was in the wrong. I learned that I was being extremely selfish, only looking out for my own children and my fear that they might somehow face bullying at home, but I wasn't considering the feelings of my stepson. I've also learned that the dynamics between siblings, something I never experienced, inevitably involve a bit of competition and rivalry.  \n\n\nI was so focused on myself and my kids that I couldn't see that if he wants to live with us, then obviously he cares about us, especially the idea of having siblings. So, I hope we will work together build a great dynamic in our house.  \n\n\n  \nI talked to my fianc\u00e9, even showed him this Reddit post, and told him that I agree our stepson should live with us, that I was wrong about my reservations concerning the boy.  \nHe talked to the mother of my stepson, who has legal custody of him. I didn't participate in the conversation, as I understand it's a moment for the biological parents. Despite being reluctant, after hearing from her own child that he wanted to live with us, she agreed to work out an arrangement where he will spend a significant amount of time with us. My fianc\u00e9 and boy's mother will still have to discuss the details.   \n\n\nAfter that, my fianc\u00e9 and I took my stepson out to eat his favorite burger and talked. I told him that we're happy to have him as a new member of our household, that we're going to look for a new house to better accommodate the family now that we'll be five, and he can have his own room. He was very happy.  \n\n\n  \nWe didn't address some concerns that I still have, like the issue of discipline and following rules. I avoided that topic so it doesn't seem like I'm threatening him to go back to living with his mom. I want him to feel accepted unconditionally in our home. But of course, we'll have that conversation about discipline with the older two soon to prevent any issues and also emphasize the importance of maintaining good grades in school.  \n\n\n  \nPS.: There's no need for anyone here to send me messages cursing me out. I've received dozens of offensive messages, and it doesn't help anyone. I've also received supportive messages with advice, and I appreciate those messages.  Internet and this community don't need to be a place for hate.", "created_utc": 1691677916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ne57c/update_aita_for_not_allowing_my_stepson12m_to/", "score": 567, "replies": ["As a step parent you need to discuss discipline with your spouse ASAP.

Grades are... less important.", "I am glad to hear that you have made this decision, \n\nEven if you don't want to discuss the issue of discipline at this point with your stepson, I feel strongly that you should discuss it with your husband. We have all heard about bio parents who tell the step parent that they do not have the right to discipline. This puts step parent in a very bad position if they are given no authority. Tell you husband that if you accept this child into your home, you will treat him exactly as you would your own kids and lovingly and fairly provide discipline and make rules as necessary. \n\nIn fact, I would ask your husband to gently warn the child that he would be treated as one of the family, so all the rules and discipline would apply. You are not his mother, but you are the authority figure in this house.", "After you and your husband discuss parenting the blended family and discipline, you should have a family meeting and present it to all the kids as house rules. This way, stepson won't feel singled out. \n\nThen with each instance of bullying or whatever, you address it individually and as privately as appropriate. \n\nAlso, I'm sure you two know, but I would strongly suggest getting the custody agreement and child support amended.", "First of all I want to say that imo you can really take note of someone's character when you see how they react when you tell them they're wrong. And I think your ability to admit you were wrong and immediately adjust your behavior shows that you want to be a good person. \n\nNext, I hope you can tolerate some unsolicited advice. The way my partner and I handle repercussions was that I was able to reinforce immediate consequences. But those consequences would only last until my partner their parent was around. And if he was around when the incident happened he would handle any repercussions. This kept me from being put in the position of being an asshole step parent but also meant that I could do something if one of the kids was being unkind to the other or me or strangers. \n\nSo for example if I was spending the day with them and their dad was at work and one of them picked a huge argument and refused to share the TV I would be able to say \" Okay. No TV (for any amount of time up until their dad got home So it could be a half hour or it could be the rest of the evening). But then when my partner would get home I would let them know what happened and they would go have it chat with their kid and there would be a discussion on whether any repercussions had to last longer than that.", "I love a happy ending", "Make certain to protect your kids, and do not have a kid with fiance until things are better.", "At least many people have sent messages wanting to help, and to those people, I'm grateful.", "I could not agree more! If I am honest, just reading that sentence rubbed me the wrong way. His Dad was his Dad long before she was in the picture and he will always be his Dad. They are becoming a blended family and as you rightly said, it should be \u201cI\u2019m glad that we are all living together.\u201d That young man will always be a member of the family, whether she accepts that or not.", "I never used him as free childcare. I was unfortunate in the example I gave about the bathroom, but I'll explain again what happens.  \n\n\n  \nWe have a young child who's 5 years old. I can't expect a 5-year-old to behave in a mature/appropriate manner at all times, but I can expect the older ones, aged 10 and 12, to understand that the 5-year-old is a little child who doesn't yet grasp various situations.  \n\n\n  \nSo, for instance, if the older two are playing video games for an hour without letting the little one join in, it's obvious they need to stop and let the little one play a bit too. Otherwise, the little one will feel sad and angry, think that his siblings don't like him, and so on. I'm not asking them to play with the little one all the time, but to look at the situation from the little one's perspective so as not to hurt him.  \n\n\n  \nIn the bathroom situation I mentioned last time, it was just me, my stepson, and my youngest son. When my youngest son is with any of the boys, he refuses to go to the bathroom with me. That day, he was practically on the verge of tears not to go with me and wanting to go with his brother. So in my view, my stepson, upon seeing the boy almost in tears over a trivial situation, should have understood he should help to prevent him from actually crying. But he only helped after I insisted a lot.  \n\n\n  \nAnyway, I believe my stepson will grasp this dynamic soon, just like my older son already does.", "She keeps calling him \"The Boy.\"", "I have already discuss about discipline with my fianc\u00e9.  \n\n\nI always believe that when a child is disciplined by a step-parent, they might perceive it as unfair, which can significantly impact the relationship between the child and the step-parent.

She wanted to place some time between the conversations so it didn't come across as a conditional offer ie \"You can live with us if you do A,B & C otherwise we're sending you back\"\n\nThis way she gets to have a conversation with her partner about how discipline will be handled and have the conversation with both older kids so neither feels singled out.\n\nPeople can make mistakes and learn from them. No reason to believe OP isn't one of them.", "Honestly, I think the issue here is just the choice of words. When I said \"member of our household,\" my fianc\u00e9 and my stepson understood that I was referring to him becoming a new resident of the house, as he didn't live here before. Regardless of whether you agree or not, the fact is that he lived at his mother's house and in practice was a visitor at ours.\n\nOf course, I did everything to make him feel that our house was also his, but there's a difference between living here and spending weekends.I never meant to say that he wasn't a part of the family. I've always treated him as a family member.\n\nThis is a part I haven't quite grasped yet. Many people talk as if I treat my stepson poorly. When my husband read the comments on the other post, he told me not to worry, because I treat his son very well, and I think it's obvious that if I mistreated him, he wouldn't want to live with me. So, where does this idea come from that I treat him poorly?  \n\n\nI know that when I said that I didn't want him living with us sounds rude. But there is a huge difference between how you treat a kid and what you discuss with your fianc\u00e9.", "I'm Sorry but your stepson isn't used to have a younger sibling and he doesn't have to act like your older son does. And If he doesn't feel comfortable taking your son to the bathroom, he shouldn't have to. This is an amazing oportunity to teach your youngest boundaries. Reduced your expectations because you are New in your stepson's life.\nIt's not your stepson's job being uncomfortable to please YOUR child and avoid their tantrums.", "You can explain all you want to and the answer is still the same. Take your 5yo to the bathroom yourself.\n\nThe 5yo cries?

It's not hard to see why people didn't make the distinction.", "1. \"Ours\" includes him. It always has, because his father's house is his own house. Maybe, he never lived there but it is still his own house. This is the part you haven't grasped yet.\n2. You were about to treat him poorly for circumstances that weren't his own fault, and for being a 12-year-old child. The purpose of my post was to change your mentality because mentality is the first part of treating a child poorly.\n3. Your behaviour may not be harmful from you or your fiance's POV, aka from an adult's perspective. But a child's perspective is very different and very insightful. Maybe your stepson noticed something bad, but brushed it under the rug. It may have been insidiously harmful, disguised as benign. After all, not wanting your stepson living with you over something that all children do, is pretty insidious and harmful to me.", "I understand that in the last post. If you look at my last sentence, I said that my stepson will learn how to be a big brother and I will have patience.  \n\n\nAnd yes, I need to talk with the little one. That is a long education process", "It's still his own house' \u2013 I completely agree with this, which is why I mentioned that I did everything to make him feel like the house was his too. But there's an aspect I didn't mention, and perhaps it's another reason for my choice of words: my fianc\u00e9 is moving into the house I live in with my kids, so chronologically, it makes sense for me to refer to it as 'my house' and say that my stepson is a new member of it.  \n\n\n  \nOf course, from his perspective, we are the new members of his family.  \n\n\n  \n'Child's perspective is very different and very insightful.' Yes, that's true. The best I can do is treat my stepson the same way I treat my own children, and I don't believe there have been any instances where I treated him differently. In fact, I realized I was expecting behaviors from him similar to those of my older son, without considering his different experiences, which made me unfair to him.", "Yes, but you need to adjust your expectations.

Adjusting to a blended family is difficult for everyone.  \n\n* My father passed away when I was young, and when my mom remarried, I went from being the oldest of 2 kids to being the second youngest of 4 kids.  It was an adjustment for everyone, especially my brother, who now had to share his bedroom with our step-brother.  Sharing the bathroom was a train-wreck, and there were lots of arguments because my step-siblings had 2 houses and their mom had no rules, whereas there were definitely rules at our house.  We got through it a day at a time just fine.  You will too.\n* As an adult now, I have a blended family.  I have 2 kids, my husband has 1.  The two girls are 2 weeks apart in age, so we joke that they're step-twins.  It's been fine, no issues at all, except that the girls are both 19 and we barely see my step-daughter.  It's like pulling teeth to see her because she lives 30 min away and works an additional 30 min away from there in the other direction.  My kids have had an adjustment having a different man as a parental figure, and he's adjusting to having kids around more and the general chaos that comes with my son.\n\nJust remember that everyone is part of your family.  Your heart grows to size of your family, and so does the amount of love you have to give.  Ignore the ugly people on here who won't give you a break when you talk about the changes you're making.

It takes a strong character to do what you did and decide to grow/learn from it. Good luck to your new blended family!", "Since you are now welcoming him into your home, be careful about preferential treatment. Kids are very sensitive to favoritism and since he is not your biologically child, that insecurity will be doubled. He has already been made to feel like he is the outsider. He could easily accept you as family, but that all depends on if you are willing to put in the work and start thinking about how to make things more equal.\n\nOne great example I have is my grandparents always made sure to spent the same amount of money on Christmas gifts and have equal amount of presents. If one kid got a big expensive present, then the others got 5 medium presents and the one with the big presents got 4 additional cheap presents. It allows the kids to never feel overlooked. Both of them were not their parents\u2019 favorite, and that kind of conditional affection sticks with somebody for the rest of their lives.\n\nThis is not to say you are being exclusionary, just something to keep in mind as you work towards a harmonious blended household.", "This update still sounds very much like you're viewing your stepson as an outsider and not part of your family. You keep talking about your children as if your stepson is not one of your children now.

Thanks for sharing!", "I think you have an excellent plan! Something I used to do when I did group therapy with younger kids was establish group rules together. Everybody got to make their own rule, \"be respecful,\" \"no spitting,\" \"don't call me JJ\" (specific, but you got it kid), etc., then we all signed it and I would hang it on the wall during group. The kids felt empowered because they had a hand in making the rules and it was a lot easier to reference our group rules if things got rowdy instead of simply using my authority to gain compliance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you can involve your kiddos in some way, even if it's not creating a rule, but just helping you type them up or drawing them on some paper, it may save you some headache when the inevitable happens and they break a rule.

Step parent when in charge if kids alone would tell kids what to do.  If kids did not comply, they went to their room without electronics or TV and waited for parent to get home.  Parent would come home and back up step parent and tell the kid to do what they were told.  Any debate about what kids should or should not be doing was discussed privately later, out of earshot of kids.  Step parent then doesn\u2019t give out punishment, but the kid learns that they can either do it now or do it later.

I completely agree that it's crucial for children of divorced parents to understand that they have two homes and to have their personal belongings in both.  \nThe thing is, we've been gradually adapting over time.  \nFirst, I got to know my stepson, then he got to know my kids, and then they started spending more time together, until it got to the point where he practically spends every weekend here (even though legally, my fianc\u00e9 only has custody every other weekend).  \n\n\n  \nHe always had his things at his dad's house.

It was \\*your\\* son's room and you (or your son) weren't willing to make space for him permanently until you can buy a new house and get him his own room?", "I'm honest. So it is the second situation.  \n\n\nBut I didn't know that he would spend so many time here. It is a recent 'event, like the last 6 month. So, we needed to adapt the room, but we didn't, what is bad I know.", "Let me ask you. Do you believe that a bed is very important?  \n\n\nWe don't have space right now to provide a dresser and other things. But we can buy a bunk bed and do other adaptions in the house.", "Yes. I understand that my stepson isn't in the best situation right now.  \n\n\nWe were already looking to move to a new house after getting married, regardless of whether he would come to live with us or not, precisely because of this issue.  \nBut we were both planning to sell our houses to buy the new one, so it would still take several months. Now, we'll be renting a house in the next few weeks. Since we were already exploring the real estate market, we already know of a house that we like.", "Okay, but you knew that he spent \\*at least\\* every other week with his father ... so you knew that if his father was moving in with you he would need some semblance of his own space, right? Even if it was just a bed and a corner of a room?", "I think that sleeping on a cot/air mattress/sleeping bag/etc for months while both of your children have their own rooms sends a message to your stepson that he is a visitor in your home. In \\*his dad's\\* home. Yes, having a bed is important if you actually want to have a successfully blended family.\n\nIf he's packing up all of his stuff and taking it back to his mom's place each time he goes back then it won't actually feel like his home.\n\nPlus, kids love bunkbeds so one of those three boys will almost certainly want it in their bedroom even when they each have their own so it won't be money wasted.\n\nETA: If you don't have space for another dresser, you could get drawers or bins that slide under the bed so he has a space to keep some things there and it feels more like his space.\n\nETA 2: My parents didn't have a lot of money when I was a kid. One of the houses my dad lived my sister and I had a bedroom that was literally the size of our twin bunk bed and enough room for the door to swing open. That was a two bedroom house, so when we were there my brother slept in my dad's bed and my dad slept on the couch because it was important to him that we felt like we had a place there. It wasn't the size of the room that mattered, it was the fact that my dad considered it \\*our home\\*", "OP, it's interesting that your husband's son - your step-son - is referred to as merely 'the boy'.   I also noticed that the FATHER of 'the boy' is always referred to as My Fiance and never as 'his father' or the like.  It's almost like you don't even want to recognize their relationship.  Seriously.  Take a look at your phrasing.  \n\n\"My fiance and I took my stepson out...\" \n\n\"My fiance and the boy's mother...\" - \n\n\"I agree that our(?!) stepson should live with us.\"\n\nit's almost like the fiance and the boy are total strangers brought together only by the OP.   It's like she can't bear to think of her fiance as a FATHER that has a SON.  Referring them almost exclusively as \"My Fiance\" and \"The Boy\" is just plain weird.", "Never forget: your husband loved \"the boy\" way before he met you, and, if circumstances come to it, will love him after you as well.\n\nYou are worse than \"new\", ma'am. \nYou could be temporary. \n\nSigned \n\n\nAn Adult with 5 Current /  Former Step Parents", "I hate to say this, OP, but... this is a bittersweet update from the POV of anyone who really cares about the kid.\n\n*\"I was so focused on myself and my kids that I couldn't see that if he wants to live with us, then obviously he cares about us, especially the idea of having siblings.\"* This. THIS. This same sentiment in your original post, and then repeated here, seems to be what turned the tide for you: Your perception that he must \"really care\" about you and your kids, and therefore, presumably, that he's earned the right or met some sort of loyalty threshold necessary to live \"with us\" \u2014 to be a new member of \"our household.\"\n\n**It doesn't matter if he likes you or not. It matters that he is, inextricably and forever, your husband's son.** He is forever part of your \"us.\" You are still writing as though you conceive of your husband's own child as merely a guest in his home. You have yet to consider that the priority and protection you afford your boys is the *exact same treatment* your stepson should be receiving from his father. Did you consider whether your boys liked you and your husband enough to earn the right to live with you both instead of their bio father? Or was it a given because \u2014 and not to belabour the point \u2014 *they are your children?* \n\nYou don't write like you're blending families; you write like you've had a disagreement with your husband about taking in a foster. I really would continue to sit down with yourself on this and think about your outlook and behavior. There are kids involved.", "My older brother would balance rocks on my door in hopes that one would hit me and tried to choke me out on the kitchen floor. He terrified me as a kid and I have almost no contact with him now. Your stepson sounds amazing. I'm glad you reconsidered.", "OP,  I am glad to hear that you went into this with an open mind and actually had constructive conversations with your husband. It is never easy melting 2 families together and there's always gonna be very unique circumstances to the challenges that you will face. But being inited and working towards the same goal is critical. I wish nothing but the best for you guys and I hope everything works out but keep in mind there will be unforeseen challenges but that's just part of life and raising children together.\n\nGood luck.", "So the 12 year.old is acting like any sibling. Most siblings within a year or two will be competitive at some point in time and what 12 year old wants to take a 5 year old to the bathroom regardless if it's just as an escort..what you see as problems sound like normal behavior to me.", "Awww this was such a nice update! Its so nice to read ones like these. It\u2019s great you were able to consider what everyone was saying on the other post and change your perspective on your stepson. Sorry people are being mean to you!", "Well done you! You have read comments, searched your soul for answers and ultimately realized the best decision for everyone. Just ignore the haters. I don't get them and they don't add anything to the conversation. I will suggest you and hubby need to have some chats about rules and discipline before these things become an issue. Better to be proactive than reactive. Good luck.", "I am very happy that you took the time for self reflection and self improvement\n\nkudos to you!", "I'm impressed with your turnaround, well done!\n\nAs long as the house rules are (not too crazy and) applied equally to everyone it should be fine.", "[removed]", "And if he gets bad grades, does he get kicked out? Like, she wouldn\u2019t kick out her bio kid but does step-son need to \u201cearn\u201d his place with good behavior and good grades? That\u2019s problematic since this is his dad\u2019s house too.", "Aren't both things true? Husband and stepson are new to her family, she and her kids are new to theirs.", "This deserves so many more upvotes", "I respectfully disagree with you. As I read this story, it seems that the OP and her fianc\u00e9 had planned their marriage with the understanding that the fianc\u00e9's son would be living with his mother.  \n\n\n  \nIt was when the fianc\u00e9's son asked to live with them that the situation took a completely new turn for which the OP was not previously prepared. She was geared up for having the boy during weekends only.  \n\n\n  \nIn this new arrangement of the boy having to be with them full-time, there are numerous factors to take into consideration. It's not as simple as adding another person to the household, especially when we're talking about caring for another child.  \n\n\n  \nSo, the first thing the OP has to weigh is the relationship among the children. Imagine, hypothetically, if the fianc\u00e9's son were a severe bully mistreating the OP's children. Should she accept that scenario without any conditions just because he's her stepson? She was concerned about her children possibly facing challenges in this unforeseen family configuration, as the stepson wouldn't be there all the time in the previous configuration.  \n\n\n  \nAnother aspect she had to contemplate is the living space. She mentioned that they're planning to move to a new house to accommodate the boy. What if she couldn't afford to move or there wasn't enough space? In that case, would it be wrong or unrealistic for her to say that the boy couldn't live with them?  \n\n\n  \nThis oversimplification that just because someone is a stepchild, the step-parent should automatically accept them living together, is more of a moral assertion than necessarily something practical in real life.  \n\n\n  \nOf course, if the boy didn't have anywhere else to go, it wouldn't even be a question of whether he should live with the OP and her fianc\u00e9.", "I\u2019m rooting for you OP! It\u2019s hard to realize you were wrong and for you to turn around like this is awesome. Wishing you and your family the best!", "Husband and stepson were there before OP and her kids.", "So your little one is a brat who cries when he doesnt get his way and you expect a 12 year old to handle that perfectly?", "So, for instance, if the older two are playing video games for an hour without letting the little one join in, it's obvious they need to stop and let the little one play a bit too.\n\nThis is not at all \"obvious.\" An hour?? Sure, they should probably make time to spend time with their little brother a few times a week, but expecting them to include him on a daily basis (let alone hourly) is just unreasonable. As other commenters have said, they have different ages and interests and it's completely normal for siblings not to spend time together every day.", "You have to *want* there to be a problem to think that's one.", "You talk about him like a rescue dog that you want to take back to the shelter. You're fooling your bf for now but he will see it eventually too.", "Where is \"there\"? OP says husband moved into her house (and now stepson is, too); she didn't move into his.\n\nIf it's not about who was in the physical house first, then I don't really get what you mean.", "Stepson is older than OPs kids. He\u2019s been around longer. Get it yet?", "Then let the 10yo do it. \n\nYour argument makes no sense. I\u2019ll go back to the original question.

Thank you for clarifying.", "Did you miss the 10yo wasn\u2019t there?

It\u2019s really not that difficult.", "Yes, it is very important.  It is the difference between him being a guest and him \"living\" in the home.  I understand the lack of space, but psychologicaly it is crucial.\n\nI would put a secondary dresser elsewhere in the house (hallway maybe) and then give both kids space in the in room dresser.  They can keep their most used clothes in the room in the dresser they share, and the least used clothes in the hallway dresser.", "Or swap clothes out seasonally maybe? Keep each of their winter clothes in a secondary location during the summer so that each of them have at least a drawer all year round"]}
