Who would throw away good food unless it was to spite someone for being extra while being a minority.", "The policing of food can get pretty bad. My brother never liked fruit as a kid so for fruit snack time at school my mum sent him broccoli and sliced mushrooms - his favourites. He got shamed by the teacher in front of the class and my mum got called and told it wasn\u2019t suitable because it wasn\u2019t a fruit. She had to complain to the principal for them to let it go. This was over ten years ago and he still has a deep dislike for anything sweet.", "My friend sent her kid to a Very Expensive Montessori preschool. They were very strict about what food you could send in. Like only unprocessed food. No goldfish or fruit snacks! They also required food be in bento boxes or reusable containers - no ziploc bags! You got a side eye if your kid\u2019s water bottle was plastic and not metal or glass. \n\nFriend pulled her kid as soon as she was able.", "True true. Pay for what you threw away! Also, thats pretty healthy for a lunch in my opinion.", "They don\u2019t have the authority to do that. I briefly worked at a daycare and we didn\u2019t check lunches but we would look at what everyone had when they were eating and encourage them to eat the main thing (sandwich, soup, leftovers, etc.) first. None of us ever confiscated a lunch or threw anything away.", "No, this is a public elementary school.

They told me for years I was just imagining it. I still don't really eat lunch.", "Teacher was hungry and ate the lunch I bet. NTA", "Even if money isn\u2019t a problem for OP and/or OP\u2019s sister, this is still wastefulness at its core and the teacher should have to answer for throwing away perfectly good food.", "Tomatoes are a vegetable because if you put them in a fruit salad I will straight-up murder you.", "She won't get fired but she needs to be spoken to.

Teacher is an ass on an ego trip.", "Do not use your niece & food to get in a war with a teacher you won\u2019t see in a week. Pack a healthy(ish) lunch for the benefit of your niece.

While I can only speak for my school, I don\u2019t think any teacher would bother doing this unless there was an actual problem with the lunch (consistently junk food, not enough food, etc).

Turns it into a popsicle.", "Let's be real - the teacher did not care that the lunch was unhealthy; she cared that it was an attractive nuisance as far as the other kids were concerned.\n\nIf she cared about it being healthy, she would have taken OP up on his suggestion to just give the child the healthier options of the lunch and not give her the sugary foods (she could have just served her the sandwich, apple slices, carrot sticks sans ranch and *maybe* the juice).\n\nInstead she threw the baby out with the bathwater.", "Speaking as a kid who all the way from birth until the end of high school had issues feeling motivated to eat, my mom (a cooking teacher with college education in nutrition and child care) often packed multiple treats in my lunch in addition to the healthy components (sandwich, fruit, vegetable, etc.), which actually helped me eat my entire lunch because I'd space out the desserts and chips with the healthier stuff so that I didn't get bored with any flavors. It's not always the healthiest thing, but every child is an individual, and if it was just an occasional treat then it wouldn't hurt anyway.", "I'm stuck on two things. One, throwing away the whole lunch just has me gaping. I'd be quasi-okay with her *confiscating* the cookie and/or brownie to send home with a polite note at the end of the day. But up and ditching the entire lot? Hell no! Wasting all that food is simply appalling to me. (I'm desperately holding back the shade of my Granny yelling about so many children going hungry today.) \n\nTwo, does/would she do this to parents at work? Call them an hour into their day to *tell*, not ask, them to bring their child a brand new lunch? And expect it *not* to come from the nearest drive through window?? What the heck, lady, who do you think these parents even are? What if they can't just leave their jobs at a moment's notice? Especially just to source and deliver a healthy replacement lunch because the teacher took it upon themselves to throw away everything in the lunch box instead of removing the two (or three, I'm unclear on what \"fruit snacks\" might entail) items that were so \u2728distracting\u2728 to the rest of the children. \n\nYikes on bikes. This whole thing has made my head hurt. NTA, but I'd be wanting to have a few *words* with that teacher, if not the administration team at the school.

Teacher was trying to teach the parent.", "MY LIFE HAS CHANGED", "Some schools (especially private schools) have pretty strict rules about what is allowed and what is not. (Note: I said SOME, not all.)\n\n3 desserts is a lot, and if it breaks school rules, teacher should have set them aside/put them in her cubby for after school. She had no right to throw it out, especially all of it. \n\nBut some schools do have guidelines, bc otherwise sometimes you see 1st graders roll up with a can of Mountain Dee, a candy bar, a bag of Doritos, and a cupcake. That\u2019s not good for them, nor for their learning. \n\nSo it\u2019s possible this school has a policy, but even still, they should have set the sweets aside and let her have the rest. The teacher was definitely being an AH.", "Exactly. Gosh would I raise hell with admin or principal if a teacher threw away all the food I prepped (= wasted money). What an AH move.", "Yeah, this sounds like a decently healthy meal. Maybe the cookies and brownie aren't the best thing in the world but it's not gonna kill her, lol.", "I grew up poor too so I know what it's like to go hungry as a kid. I can't imagine a teacher throwing away perfectly good food for no reason. Most of the lunch OP packed was healthy so obviously this particular teacher has a bug up her ass for some reason. There's never a good reason to let a 4 year old go hungry.", "That honestly seems so stupid to me", ">Teacher was trying to teach the parent.\n\nStill not the teacher's job, regardless of the school.", "I upvoted you and I\u2019m stoned but I don\u2019t think fruit snacks are a dessert.

Many parents/guardians are working and don't have time (or the ability) to leave their job, go home, make a new lunch, take it to school, then head back to work. Would this teacher then have fished niece's food back out of the trash? If she even really tossed it out to begin with?\n\nOf course, the teacher knew auntie was in charge that day. And took it for granted that auntie wasn't busy with a million other things adults do during the day. I doubt she would've pulled this stunt with mom. \n\nWhat a piece of.... work.", "I agree.
