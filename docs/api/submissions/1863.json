It must suck having such narrow minded, stifling parents/grandparents.", "NTA.  Yours is an unusual profession so lots of questions are to be expected.   But you certainly were not a bad influence; just the opposite you are a good role model imo.", "NTA. Boyfriend and the niblings sound okay, major side eye to the rest of the family.", "You gave his parents a heads up about the natural consequences of your profession. They had ample opportunity to talk about it with their kids ahead of time had they wanted to. Assuming you are correct and they didn't take your warning seriously, they still had an opportunity once you were at the dinner to explain it in a kid-friendly fashion. \n\nIn the absence of explicit guidance from them, you did a very natural and reasonable thing: you gave a simple and straightforward explanation of your visible injuries, complete with video evidence of where they came from.\n\nI'll admit, I was both surprised and impressed with how you describe your explanation, and then I realized that, like any other profession, you've probably had ample practice in responding to common questions about it. So I'm no longer surprised, but I am still quite impressed.\n\nNTA\n\nThe funny thing is that the family is completely overreacting.

I can't find fault with a single thing you described doing or saying. Sounds like your BF's family's reactions are their own problem to deal with, not yours.", "NTA Boxing is a respectable profession. You are an athlete, and practice a sport. Now if you were a drug dealer entertaining the young folks with your escapades I would agree with his parents. They might have been more accepting if you were male. So you did nothing wrong. They are just narrow minded.", "NTA \n\nBoxing is a job.... they wouldn't complain if you were a dude. They shouldn't complain now. \n\nFurther and this is almost irrelevant, children aren't that impressionable. If they are worried about their kids.

It sounds like there's good reason he's been LC. Like, did they expect you to look runway-ready after a match? \n\nBarbarian Barbie would be a dope stage name, tbh.
