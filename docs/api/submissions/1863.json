My boyfriend (35M) is really supportive of my career and he\u2019s a total gem.  We live on the opposite coast from his family and he has had a pretty sour relationship with his dad for years, so I\u2019ve never met them.  Over the last year, though, his parents have been making efforts to patch things up so when he mentioned that we were going to be in a nearby city to them for one of my matches, they wanted to get together for a family dinner.  I was actually kind of excited about it.  I don\u2019t have family and his family is huge, so I always wondered what that was like.\n\nWe originally tried to schedule the dinner for before the match because I look a mess for a couple of days after a match sometimes, but they had a conflict so we set it up for a couple days after before we flew out to give me some recovery time.  I actually didn\u2019t get that badly banged up, but there\u2019s just no hiding face bruises and cuts. My boyfriend already gave the parents a heads up about what to expect but I don\u2019t think they took it seriously. \n\nWe get there and his mom looks really uncomfortable and his dad is just like staring at me.  Some of his siblings and their families were there and I get mobbed by the nieces and nephews who all had about a million questions and that\u2019s where I might have messed up. I told them about boxing and showed them a video on my phone of part of my fight so they would understand why I looked hurt and assured them I was fine. It evidently impressed the hell out of a couple of the nieces because they spent the entire dinner asking me questions and were kind of amazed that girls can do stuff like that.\n\nHis dad tried to shift the conversation several times and got pretty annoyed about it, and then said it was good I was thinking about retiring and getting on with a real life soon and I would have time to get a household together and start a family with Boyfriend. I told him that at most I would shift into being a trainer and I\u2019ve already got the life I want.  His mom made a comment about it being a shame I was bruising up my pretty face and I joked that this was my winner face, she should have seen the other woman.\n\nThe whole thing was just uncomfortable and weird, except for the kids and one of his sisters. When we got home, Boyfriend checked his texts and immediately called and yelled at his parents. I found out later that his mom told him I was really inappropriate and a bad influence on the kids. One of his brothers asked if he was going to bring \u201cBarbarian Barbie\u201d back to Christmas because his kids were bouncing off the walls.  But, his cool sister told him their daughter was already asking when Auntie OP was coming back.\n\nIt really has caused a major problem between my boyfriend and his parents and I\u2019m wondering if I should have just kept the boxing stuff to myself.", "created_utc": 1667974107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqae6u/aita_for_being_a_bad_influence_at_dinner_with_my/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your boyfriend gave the family a heads up, and still decided to move the dinner from before your fight to after. You have nothing to be ashamed about. I feel bad for some of those kids though. It must suck having such narrow minded, stifling parents/grandparents.", "NTA.  Yours is an unusual profession so lots of questions are to be expected.   But you certainly were not a bad influence; just the opposite you are a good role model imo.", "NTA. Boyfriend and the niblings sound okay, major side eye to the rest of the family.", "You gave his parents a heads up about the natural consequences of your profession. They had ample opportunity to talk about it with their kids ahead of time had they wanted to. Assuming you are correct and they didn't take your warning seriously, they still had an opportunity once you were at the dinner to explain it in a kid-friendly fashion. \n\nIn the absence of explicit guidance from them, you did a very natural and reasonable thing: you gave a simple and straightforward explanation of your visible injuries, complete with video evidence of where they came from.\n\nI'll admit, I was both surprised and impressed with how you describe your explanation, and then I realized that, like any other profession, you've probably had ample practice in responding to common questions about it. So I'm no longer surprised, but I am still quite impressed.\n\nNTA\n\nThe funny thing is that the family is completely overreacting. While it is very cool that girls can be boxers, most girls (and most boys for that matter) don't really want to be... Which means, like many other things kids get excited about, their excitement about this will fade.", "You're an athlete. And a winner. How does this make you a bad influence on little girls? I'm proud as hell of you. You have a career and a real life right now and you don't need to meet an absurd expectations about feminine grace, poise and beauty. (HAs your BF's mom ever seen photos of Laila Ali in the ring? Bad azzed chicks are all girl. Period.\n\nAt any rate, NTA. Why hide your light under some prehistoric bushel? That's silly to me. Live your life and enjoy the life you're living.", "NTA\n\nYou are showing everyone that women can be both badass and beautiful. The younger kids are so pure that they right through the \"sex\" aspect of the sport and saw an athlete boxing and enjoyed it very much.  His parents are so old fashioned they should be living in the 1930's. Keep doing you and keep that supportive partner of yours. He is a keeper.", "NTA, I can see why he's not close to his family.", "NTA. Your boyfriend's parents have been messing up his family life for years- you're just the latest excuse for rudeness and drama. Time to start taking your coaching from your boyfriend - watch how he sets limits with them, stays low contact and distances himself. Do that.", "NTA. I can't find fault with a single thing you described doing or saying. Sounds like your BF's family's reactions are their own problem to deal with, not yours.", "NTA Boxing is a respectable profession. You are an athlete, and practice a sport. Now if you were a drug dealer entertaining the young folks with your escapades I would agree with his parents. They might have been more accepting if you were male. So you did nothing wrong. They are just narrow minded.", "NTA \n\nBoxing is a job.... they wouldn't complain if you were a dude. They shouldn't complain now. \n\nFurther and this is almost irrelevant, children aren't that impressionable. If they are worried about their kids. Don't worry about the female boxer they see maybe twice a year. Worry about influencers on tiktok and instagram trying to sell them stuff every minute of every day. You know the good Christian girls with psalms in their bio marketing supplements and make up.", "NTA \n\nEven from the post you can kinda get the feel what type of people his parents (and his brother) are. The whole women should be house makers and nothing else. They even said that to your face. You did good, especially for those little girls who didn\u2019t even know girls could do stuff like that. They were warned before hand, they were the ones asking the nosy questions and you answered truthfully \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they hurt their own feelings \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who wasn't allowed to even try out for football because I'd \"just cry as soon as I was shoved over\", I wish I had an auntie like you growing up. \n\nWhat is it about \"exposing\" young girls to sports that's so dang threatening to people like bf's family? It sounds like there's good reason he's been LC. Like, did they expect you to look runway-ready after a match? \n\nBarbarian Barbie would be a dope stage name, tbh. Maybe convince the niblings to sneak-watch MMA matches on the sly. Nothing makes something already cool become *more* cool than a bit of rebellion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Boxing is a huge part of your life and who you are.

Go for Christmas and get the kids t shirts that say Barbarian Barbie. \n\nShowing girls they have options is not being a bad influence. That would be someone telling you to settle down when you\u2019re pretty settled.", "NTA and his dad's comment about retiring and \"getting on with real life\" meaning setting up a household for a man and bearing children is just such a limited idea of gender roles it makes me gag. \n\nOf course you had to get into the boxing stuff. They wanted to know, and the kids were fascinated. Unless your BF was going to say he was responsible for your face, but that would have more than it's own drawbacks.", "NTA so what you taught kids that girls can be tough too hows that being a bad influence? Oh sorry girls should be pretty n pop babies out I forgot \ud83d\ude44", "totally NTA. you aren't doing anything wrong to be called a \"bad influence\". that description is just being thrown around these days by people to others who don't qualify to their standards.", "NTA  They have some issues they could work on though.  The audacity of them basically telling you that you have to be a housewife.  They are calling you a bad influence because you don\u2019t fit into their idea of what a woman should be.  They sound terribly close minded.  Your boyfriend sounds awesome, though.   Hopefully you can have a good relationship with the cool sister and not have to deal with the parents very much. It\u2019s not your fault they can\u2019t handle your career and you shouldn\u2019t have to hide who you are, which is a boxer. And that is pretty cool!", "NTA They didn\u2019t take you seriously because the concept of a woman fighting is foreign to them. When the kids asked you questions it was only logical to show them why you had marks on you. Kids are inquisitive. What if they began to wonder if their uncle did it? \n\nThe fact they think you being a pro boxer is somehow a shameful thing to let kids know says a lot about them and why your bf was not close to them. It would be interesting to ask if your boyfriend or his brothers ever came home bloody from a fight and how their parents reacted.", "NTA\n\nIf they think that this is a bad influence, well, boohoo. \nI hope the girls in your BF's family take an example out of you and remember that it's OK to be fierce. \n\nI've started boxing late in life (around 30, 4 years ago) and while I'll never be in a ring, it's people like you I look up to and keep me motivated. \n\nYou rock and congrats on winning the match! \n\nBtw, I low key love the name Barbarian Barbie \ud83d\ude02", "As a kid, my favorite relatives/parents of friends were my friend\u2019s dad who got electrocuted so badly that he got lifetime worker\u2019s comp, and my aunt who raised snakes and routinely spent weeks in the hospital after being bitten. \n\nKids like people who do stupid shit, especially if that stupid shit results in fun stories. \n\nGettting punched in the face for a living is a sure fire way to guarantee all the kids in your family love you.", "Agreed, and if you are feeling petty have Barbarian Barbie added to your intro next time", "Like they've never seen a female athlete before?

Most kids absolutely love it and then drop it (or at least don't go competitive) when they find out that they don't enjoy getting punched in the face. That doesn't happen until much later on so until then it's just a fun way to get exercise in and work on coordination. No harm done. \n\nSame is true for most contact sports.
