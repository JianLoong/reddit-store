I clean the kitchen and the bathroom when I can see it getting messy as well, as no one wants to live in filth. \nMy second housemate, B, lives in the downstairs room and neither of us have ever seen her clean. She has a WC downstairs and uses the upstairs shower. She keeps all her kitchen utensils in her room so we can\u2019t use them (fair enough) but still probably uses the kitchen the most out of all of us. \n\nI work full time graveyard shift outside of university, so does A. B works mornings and comes home around 2pm every day. \nThe hob is always caked in burned oil after she uses it, she leaves crumbs and staines all over the counters and leaves piles of washing up on the side. We have a dishwasher but she used the last of the tablets for it and decided not to replace them or ask anyone to replace them. \n\nThe floor is so grim we usually wear shoes downstairs. \nThe downstairs bathroom is a state constantly, which is also the bathroom guests expect to use when they come round, the floor is filthy, the toilet is not clean, the sink hasn\u2019t been cleaned in what looks like 10 months and there\u2019s always toilet roll everywhere. The upstairs bathroom she leaves hair all over, never replaces the toilet roll and sprays water everywhere when she showers. \n\nWe, me and A, have asked her to be more considerate about shared space and she uses her disabilities as an excuse. She has been diagnosed with Autism and depression and is waiting for a meeting regarding other neurodivergence. Me and A both have mental illnesses of our own such as depression and anxiety but we don\u2019t use it as an excuse not to do something. We understand we can\u2019t always expect her to clean up if she\u2019s having a bad day but that could be applied to everyone in the house. \n\nShe recently attacked A\u2019s boyfriend when he called her out and said if he didn\u2019t reply to her (after she\u2019d been screaming and shouting at him) that he was discriminating against her because of her disabilities. \n\nIt gets to a point where we ask her to be considerate and she acts like we\u2019re the problem not her. We are both tired, just want some free time to relax instead of cleaning up after her 24/7. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681655413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12oah4n/aita_for_asking_my_housemate_with_disabilities_to/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's one thing if was her room and her private area, its a whole other thing if it is a shared space. She needs to clean and grow up.", "NTA.\n\nShe doesnt deserve to live with roommates then. Just because youre lazy doesnt mean you can push it onto mental illnesses. Its an insult to the people like the OP who faces it too.", "NTA\n\nWe don\u2019t need to explain to you that mental illness is not an excuse for being shitty and disrespecting the people in your life for prolonged periods of time. Refusing to clean up after yourself falls into that category.", "NTA - as part of her agreement to rent, keeping communal areas clean and tidy  would be part of that. \n\nRequest is reasonable", "NTA. Though I wouldn't suggest continuing to room with her in the future. \n\nHaving disabilities doesn't mean you get to live in filth. If she needs help cleaning, then she needs to admit that and ask for help. And you haven't mentioned a physical disability. Just neurodivergence. If she had a limiting physical disability it would be different. \n\nAs it stands, you are NTA. She needs to pull up her big girl pants and ask for help to clean. Perhaps she is so overwhelmed she doesn't know where to start. Was she ever taught How to clean a room? See if she is receptive to having that conversation. Could you help her by providing a breakdown list of What needs cleaning and roughly how often? (Literally itemized)", "Any excuse. On the spectrum myself ,possibly not in the happiest headspace in the moment and my god I am appalled. The nerve to use any mental illness to excuse being a slob.  If she got diagnosed with anything you would be dealing with the same bullshit.  Ingrown toenail would lead to the same result. Laziness is not a disability.If she can cook for herself she can clean for herself.Any way of replacing her?", "NTA - she may need to find something that works for reminders (like a list on the fridge that has steps for cooking that includes cleanup or a schedule in the bathroom) but she isn\u2019t physically incapable. \n\nMy partner is likely on the spectrum. I just remind him hey, I need you to do dishes/laundry whatever and he has no problem getting it done when I ask.

You're not her carers. NTA", "For the sake of voting, NTA. Living with roommates is hard. Some people\u2019s parents prepare them for the real world well and some don\u2019t, unfortunately. But it sounds like the 3 of you never had a conversation about household duties and how they\u2019re split. You\u2019re holding her to expectations that she doesn\u2019t seem to explicitly know are there. I would have a sit down meeting between the 3 of you about how you want it to look going forward and what expectations all 3 of you have for housework as well as other things. Maybe make/find a worksheet online so you\u2019re all prepared to talk about the same topics. Once you have an agreement that you all sign, it might be easier to hold her accountable to helping you two keep up a clean house. And having her prepare and bring topics as well will, hopefully, make her feel less confronted since it sounds like she shuts down when she feels that way.", "NTA.\n\nAutistic person here.\nPersonally I find cleaning very difficult. I find it hard to find a starting point and to keep focused throughout, and will very often feel very overwhelmed very quickly.\n\nThat being said, I still try. I clean in smaller increments, and have adapted the \"might as well\" method.\nIt's not perfect, my house is very seldomly spotless unless my partner takes a cleaning fit.\n\nHonestly if her disability stops her from cleaning shared spaces she needs to either hire someone (or get a family member) to help her with it, or just.. Not live with other people", "NTA. If my physically disabled 10yo can clean up behind himself, my autistic 6yo can also clean up behind himself, and even my 2yo can wipe off spills and put things away/in the bin when needed, there's definitely no reason why a grown adult can't do it!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell lazy bones to either start cleaning up after herself or she (or you) needs to move.", "Nta. If they are a roommate, then they need to show a basic level of respect. If they want someone to just take care of them, they need to move e back to mom's place or look into assisted living. \n\nI know may many people with physical and/or mental health issues. There are things that some of them cannot do. Those things are stated and respected.  Being lazy, dirty, and rude are not on the list.", "NTA\n\nAutism and depression can be an explanation but is assholish to always use as an excuse. It means she needs to develop strategies to get through life. \nWithout knowing why she\u2019s in a wheelchair it\u2019s hard to address physical capabilities but if she can cook then she can certainly clean up after herself.", "NTA I live with my mom, who uses a wheelchair. She folds laundry, occasionally helps with dishes if I'm not feeling well, uses a swiffer to clean up the dirt she tracks in on her wheels and replaces the tp when it gets used up. \n\n\nShe does what she can to help. As long as it's within her abilities, she'll do it.", "NTA. It's perfectly okay to expect every person you live in to pitch in. I'm autistic myself, and autism is a spectrum. You said they are being evaluated for another form of neurodivergence, I'm willing to bet it is adhd from what I've read here. People with ADHD tend to have issues with executive dysfunction, like cleaning often. Autism and adhd (also add) are not mental illness, they are neurodevelopmental disorders. Meaning they happen during development as a fetus. Now these neurodivergencies do often lead to having mental illness like depression and anxiety. It looks lazy from the outside, most definitely. On the inside it can be a huge internal struggle, in which is very possible they feel awful for not doing more. A lazy person won't give af if things are messy, a person with executive dysfunction often hates the mess and the mess itself becomes debilitating to work with/on. You can have empathy and compassion for these things while simultaneously setting boundaries for yalls spaces. If she can't follow that, it's okay for you to enact your boundaries. Whether that be asking her to move, or finding ways to make it work. Often people with adhd do a lot better with cleaning when they have a body double, or someone to be around or actively clean with. This may be something you want to enact to see if it helps before eviction. When you or the other roommate clean, she should participate at that time too. You're not responsible for guiding her, but if you'd like to help this might be useful tactic to finding harmony in yalls shares living arrangements.", "NTA. You could get someone in weekly to clean and split the cost 3 ways (yes ridiculous to have to do that but it's an option) or you and other roommate can put your foot down and tell her she starts cleaning up after herself or you will find a new roommate.", "NTA. If you're in a dorm, maybe the RA can help. If not, work with the landlord to give her a move out notice. It's in the landlord's best interest to have people there that take care of the place. She doesn't have a physical disability and there is no excuse to be that gross.", "NTA\n\nI'm not autistic nor do I know anyone that has autism but I do feel that your housemate is being quite inconsiderate by using the fact she has autism as an excuse to not do her part by cleaning up after herself. \n\nShe sounds like she may be going through some stuff. If this is the case maybe she should consider seeing a therapist so she doesn't have to keep taking out her frustation on you and your other housemate.\n\nYou are definitely not in the wrong, I hope you guys can sort out this situation.", "NTA she's just learned that people tend to back off when be she says that. She's clearly manipulative and using people.", "NTA.  Neuronormal people don't want to clean either, but they force themselves to because you get bugs otherwise.  She can clean or she can be evicted, her choice.", "NTA.\n\nThese types of things are easy to fix.  OP cleans week 1, A cleans week 2, B pays for a house cleaner for week 3.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nEarly in my career, my wife and I had barely anytime to do anything.  Neither of us wanted to spend our free time cleaning--I know for some people it is therapeutic I'm not one of those people.  We hired a cleaning lady to come in once a week, and it was the best money we every spent.", "Her disabilities are not an excuse for not cleaning. If she can\u2019t contribute to maintaining the house, she needs to go live elsewhere and you live with people who can honor their commitments to maintaining the household", "NTA - She is making excuses that sound like baloney to me.", "NTA.  How did I know that this would be autism.  It's a spectrum,  yes, but people still use it as an excuse.  I have two on the spectrum, one very high and one very low.  We still make the teen with a mind of a 2 year old pick up after himself.  Depression, if she's functioning in the rest of her life and is only lacking in cleaning, then that is not an excuse, either.", "NTA, she's lazy, not disabled", "Agreed. If she won\u2019t clean, she needs to find another way to keep everything sanitary, and a cleaning service is a good compromise. She\u2019s an adult and clearly living on her own, and should be figuring out how to make the situation work for all involved.", "Ditto. I have issues with executive functioning and depression. Keeping my room in good can be at times incredibly challenging. So, I prioritize shared spaces when I am cleaning up - because that way I can (for the most part) maintain the social compacts inherent in a roommate situation even if my room is only lovely and tidy during my upswings.", "This is true", ">If she can cook for herself she can clean for herself.Any way of replacing her?\n\nAs someone that is physically disabled, I agree with this.  I have just as many issues with cooking as I do with the cleaning.  Honestly, the cooking part is more difficult if I'm being honest, because I can't just stop cooking and go back to it in 10 minutes after resting because food would (usually) burn.  If she can cook, she can clean.", ">Without knowing why she\u2019s in a wheelchair\n\nDid I miss where it says she is in a wheelchair?  All I remember seeing is she has autism and depression..."]}
