You said they are being evaluated for another form of neurodivergence, I'm willing to bet it is adhd from what I've read here. People with ADHD tend to have issues with executive dysfunction, like cleaning often. Autism and adhd (also add) are not mental illness, they are neurodevelopmental disorders. Meaning they happen during development as a fetus. Now these neurodivergencies do often lead to having mental illness like depression and anxiety. It looks lazy from the outside, most definitely. On the inside it can be a huge internal struggle, in which is very possible they feel awful for not doing more. A lazy person won't give af if things are messy, a person with executive dysfunction often hates the mess and the mess itself becomes debilitating to work with/on. You can have empathy and compassion for these things while simultaneously setting boundaries for yalls spaces. If she can't follow that, it's okay for you to enact your boundaries. Whether that be asking her to move, or finding ways to make it work. Often people with adhd do a lot better with cleaning when they have a body double, or someone to be around or actively clean with. This may be something you want to enact to see if it helps before eviction. When you or the other roommate clean, she should participate at that time too. You're not responsible for guiding her, but if you'd like to help this might be useful tactic to finding harmony in yalls shares living arrangements.", "NTA.

A talks to you like you're a maid or a dog. If she can't treat you like a human being, then she doesn't deserve to interact with you.\n\nIf she attacks someone, then she is not in control of herself. If she's not in control, then someone has to take responsibility for her. That's not your job. \n\nTalk to your landlord about this. Emphasize how you've tried fixing the problem but A is choosing to keep the bathroom disgusting. There could be damage that you don't see. He could issue her a warning or not renew her and have you find a replacement roommate.", "NTA. Give her notice to move out. Find a new housemate. She is gross.", "NTA. I get that she\u2019s only got so mich energy, but she needs to then budget some energy for cleanup. If she\u2019s too tired after making a meal from scratch, then she needs to switch to more heat-and-eat or similar options with less mess and less cleanup.", "I completely understand; however, if you live with other people and you have enough energy to make a mess, then you should at least make an attempt to clean to pick it up. I do agree she should maybe look into a space where people can help her, but it shouldn\u2019t be her roommates."]}
