But maintaining (especially) private aspects of her own cultural/religious/family identity, is NOT 'acting like (her) way is the only way'.

That's ridiculous to demand, when she spent most of her life in the USA. \n\nShe's allowed to maintain her own language/culture/family bonds, in ways that are appropriate. Yes, even if it's American culture. A small cross symbolising her relationship with your Grandmother, is one such way.

I love it here and never plan on going back, but my sister (14F) is the complete opposite. She hates it here, she refuses to speak French at home, and is taking longer than she should to learn it. But now she's also doing something which I feel is across the line.\n\nIn France you can't wear anything religious to school. My family isn't really religious, but my sister got this cross necklace from our grandmother (she isn't dead, we just don't really see her since we moved). I found out the other day that she's been wearing it to school under her shirt, which is against the rules.\n\nI told her either she stops, or I'll tell them that she's doing that. She says if I do that she'll never speak to me again, but I think she's exaggerating. I also told our parents, but they just told me to back off. The thing is I don't want to be that stereotypical American who tries to act like their way is the only way, and I think this will prove I respect the rules of my new home.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As such, he resents his sister for being in the same position of \"outsider.\" He sees her as holding him back from group acceptance.\n\nThe truth is that if OP embraces both his heritage of his earlier childhood as well as the adoptive country he's found, people are more likely to respond positively to him.  It's weird and creepy when someone makes their entire identity into something everyone else in the group already has, (and in more depth and duration than the person who has only just started.)\n\nAny attempt to \"prove how French he is\" will only come across like an amateur trying to convince Zinedine Zidane how they're really both the same since he plays soccer too!  It doesn't prove anything other than desperation.\n\nOP needs to take a deep breath, step back, and quit valuing himself based on how well he assimilates. Once he figures out who he is as an identity other than just \"French-immigrant\" he can make friends who like that person, who want to spend time with him and who value him for more than just how French he can pretend to be.\n\nAnd then maybe he'll have a little compassion for his sister. \nA homesick kid who just misses her grandma.", "THIS!!!! \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95", "Which is probably his real motivation.

Unless your family participated in the revolution, you\u2019re foreign (being sarcastic but just barely).  They are very closed to truly accepting anyone not of French ancestry.
