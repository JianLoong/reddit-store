But maintaining (especially) private aspects of her own cultural/religious/family identity, is NOT 'acting like (her) way is the only way'. You CAN'T force her to abandon everything American and become 100% French. That's ridiculous to demand, when she spent most of her life in the USA. \n\nShe's allowed to maintain her own language/culture/family bonds, in ways that are appropriate. Yes, even if it's American culture. A small cross symbolising her relationship with your Grandmother, is one such way.

I love it here and never plan on going back, but my sister (14F) is the complete opposite. She hates it here, she refuses to speak French at home, and is taking longer than she should to learn it. But now she's also doing something which I feel is across the line.\n\nIn France you can't wear anything religious to school. My family isn't really religious, but my sister got this cross necklace from our grandmother (she isn't dead, we just don't really see her since we moved). I found out the other day that she's been wearing it to school under her shirt, which is against the rules.\n\nI told her either she stops, or I'll tell them that she's doing that. She says if I do that she'll never speak to me again, but I think she's exaggerating. I also told our parents, but they just told me to back off. The thing is I don't want to be that stereotypical American who tries to act like their way is the only way, and I think this will prove I respect the rules of my new home.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
