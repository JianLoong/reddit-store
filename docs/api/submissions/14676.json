Bdays in my hubbys fam are big, everyone is invited. My hubbys fam is big, he is one of 8. They are loud, obnoxious & rude. They live in the same town as us. We are expected to attend every holiday, bday, family get together, etc. My hubby/myself usually end up getting bullied by his fam, we are not close. His fam cannot stand me. I am not from the town we live, my fam lives out of state. His fam is very traditional,I am flexible. We think differently politically & religiously.\nAbout a month ago my MIL calls & asks what we are doing for my sons bday. She informed me that if I wasn't going to throw a party where everyone (my husband's siblings & their kids) was invited, then she would throw my son his bday at her house.\nI told my MIL that I'd throw him a party at our home & started planning. I sent out the invites, everyone rsvp'd yes. \nA day before the party, my BIL contacted us & asked us to push the party back an hour so he could take his wife out for her bday dinner, my son and her share the same bday. We didn't want to fight & said yes. My BIL invited all of my hubbys sibs & my MIL/FIL to the dinner. He invited us, but we passed as they were going to a nice steak house & we didn't feel it would be great for a 3 year old. \nThe day of my son's bday, he helped me make and decorate his bday cake. He wanted to open his gifts, but because all of my in laws had to be around to watch him open them, I had to keep telling him no throughout the day. We went out for dinner, while there my hubby gets a text from his bro, asking him to push the party back another hour. Apparently, everyone arrived late, they had to wait to be seated and were waiting to order/get their food. Our party was supposed to start at 5 & now been pushed to 7. At 6:45 we got a text asking us to push it back to 7:30, it was taking a while to get their check. My hubby told his fam that if they weren't at our house by 7:30 then the party would be canceled. At 7:30 no one was at our house. My husband called his mom to find out where they were. They were leaving the restaurant which was 20ish mins away from our house. I was mad, my 3 year old was falling asleep & my hubby was done. He canceled the party & told his fam not to come over. I ended up putting my son to bed. \nAt 8 there was banging on our door, it was my MIL and one of my BILs. They started screaming at my hubby about how awful & selfish he was. I came downstairs & my BIL told me that everyone hated me & that I was the \"problem\" in the family. My husband pushed them out our door & told them again to leave. 5 minutes later, 2 of my SILs showed up. My husband stepped out onto our front porch as they screamed at him & told him I was crazy & needed therapy. He told them to leave too.

Still to this day, my in-laws felt they were in the right for what happened on our sons bday. I have still never received an apology. \nThe next morning my MIL called begging to do a do over party at her house. Honestly, we were emotionally drained, and my husband being a people pleaser agreed to it. I was still fuming so I stayed at home. Prior to the \"do over\" we held our own little family party, he had his cake, opened his gifts, played with his new toys, etc. Pretty good considering. My hubby went to his moms and the party was a little over the top, almost over compensating for the complete shit show the night before. My inlaws later told me it was the best party because I wasn't there. \nWe played the narcissistic family abuse game for another few years. Lots of events ruined in an attempt to keep the peace. We realize our part in allowing a lot of things to go down, we were in survival mode, trying to keep the peace while trying to preserve family relationships. About 5 years after the bday incident, we went nc, too much had gone down and nothing was ever getting resolved. We were emotionally drained, our marriage was hanging on by threads, it wasn't good. Because this is a narcissistic abuse situation, we have dealt with a lot of drama. Lots of flying monkeys, guilt trips, crossing boundaries, gossip and rumors. We have now be nc for almost 9 years. My 3 year old is now a handsome 17 year old. We ended up moving away partially to get away from the drama, partially for better work opportunities. My MIL has since passed. The last year of her life/funeral is another story for another day. \nThank you to all who shared their advise. To those who are struggling with narcissistic abuse, bad in laws: there is light at the end of the tunnel. Get therapy! Going nc was the best for us as a couple, we experienced a lot of personal growth, took a lot of risks, and found our voice. We now say no to a lot of things that interfere with our inner peace. I hope you can find your inner peace too!", "*INFO*\n\nSo, lots of people are wondering why we chose to have the party at 5 pm.
