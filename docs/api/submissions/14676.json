Bdays in my hubbys fam are big, everyone is invited. My hubbys fam is big, he is one of 8. They are loud, obnoxious & rude. They live in the same town as us. We are expected to attend every holiday, bday, family get together, etc. My hubby/myself usually end up getting bullied by his fam, we are not close. His fam cannot stand me. I am not from the town we live, my fam lives out of state. His fam is very traditional,I am flexible. We think differently politically & religiously.\nAbout a month ago my MIL calls & asks what we are doing for my sons bday. She informed me that if I wasn't going to throw a party where everyone (my husband's siblings & their kids) was invited, then she would throw my son his bday at her house.\nI told my MIL that I'd throw him a party at our home & started planning. I sent out the invites, everyone rsvp'd yes. \nA day before the party, my BIL contacted us & asked us to push the party back an hour so he could take his wife out for her bday dinner, my son and her share the same bday. We didn't want to fight & said yes. My BIL invited all of my hubbys sibs & my MIL/FIL to the dinner. He invited us, but we passed as they were going to a nice steak house & we didn't feel it would be great for a 3 year old. \nThe day of my son's bday, he helped me make and decorate his bday cake. He wanted to open his gifts, but because all of my in laws had to be around to watch him open them, I had to keep telling him no throughout the day. We went out for dinner, while there my hubby gets a text from his bro, asking him to push the party back another hour. Apparently, everyone arrived late, they had to wait to be seated and were waiting to order/get their food. Our party was supposed to start at 5 & now been pushed to 7. At 6:45 we got a text asking us to push it back to 7:30, it was taking a while to get their check. My hubby told his fam that if they weren't at our house by 7:30 then the party would be canceled. At 7:30 no one was at our house. My husband called his mom to find out where they were. They were leaving the restaurant which was 20ish mins away from our house. I was mad, my 3 year old was falling asleep & my hubby was done. He canceled the party & told his fam not to come over. I ended up putting my son to bed. \nAt 8 there was banging on our door, it was my MIL and one of my BILs. They started screaming at my hubby about how awful & selfish he was. I came downstairs & my BIL told me that everyone hated me & that I was the \"problem\" in the family. My husband pushed them out our door & told them again to leave. 5 minutes later, 2 of my SILs showed up. My husband stepped out onto our front porch as they screamed at him & told him I was crazy & needed therapy. He told them to leave too.

He deserved a birthday where his family prioritized them. What kind of person expects a 3-year-old to be awake and excited to see them after 8pm? What jerks.", "OMG NTA. Your in-laws are horrible, selfish, entitled AHs. It's more likely that they wanted to push the party back because they were all having such a good time and didn't want to go to a silly party for a kid, wouldn't matter whose kid it was other than their own. Stay as far away from these people as you possibly can. You already know they don't like you, it's clear they think very little of your son as well. To expect you to rearrange your son's special day just to accommodate their fun is beyond wretched.", "NTA.\n\nI am going to try and be as respectful as I can be.  Why in the world are you asking this question.  First you was pressured into something you didn't want to do.  Two they kept pushing the time back.  Three you had to disappoint your son because he \"couldn't\" open his pressies, cos family couldn't be assed to turn up, at a reasonable time for a 3 year old.  4 You set a boundary so you can put your son to bed.  5 Then they come on by to argue with you and scream at you.  6 Your son was in bed, an they thought it was appropriate to start an argument?  7 They really don't care about your son or are so stupid (I cant decide), cos they thought it was ok to go to a steak house first for the sister in law instead of three year olds party, what's wrong with going to the steak house later or earlier.  That's without all the BS they have given you in the past.\n\nAt this point, I would of said let me check my giveafuckamatron to see how many I should give.\n\n\\[edit\\]  The most important thing for me would of been making the day about my child's birthday.  On a personal note, I do this on every birthday, dont create or allow anyone to create any drama, and make it about the persons whose birthday it is.  \\[end of edit\\]", "NTA, kiddo is 3 for crying out loud. Your poor kiddo was shoved aside, why couldn't they come over first and then go out to dinner for BILs wife?! 7:30-8pm can be super late for a 3 year old with a routine. Kiddo was a champ but honestly why does your hubby want to stay around them?! They sound terrible.", "NTA - with 7 siblings, you are expected to be at everyone\u2019s birthdays + holidays? That sounds like it\u2019s at least a twice a month expectation. How exhausting. Plus they were incredibly rude expecting you to begin a 3 year old\u2019s party at 8 PM. Sounds like you and your hubby need to set some boundaries and reclaim your nuclear family.", "NTA. They should've prioritized your son's birthday party first, then dinner for SIL afterwards. Did they really expect you to keep your toddler son awake late at night for a birthday party? 7-8pm should be like a nighttime routine and bedtime for a kid that age, not party time with cake and toys.", "NTA but awesome that your husband stood up and made the call so you didn\u2019t have to. Next year have the party with your family and graciously invite the in-laws to join you out of state for his party.", "NTA a thousand times, birthday of a three year old should be taking preference over birthday of a grown-ass adult, even if it's a birthday ending in a zero for them. They sound like a nightmare bunch tbh, have you crossposted this to r/JUSTNOMIL or similar?", "Info: Why did no one consider having the child\u2019s birthday in the afternoon followed by the dinner?", "Nta you tried to be accmodating and they just took advantage", "100% NTA.  Especially given that everyone got there when the birthday boy was in bed.", "NTA Not at all, that was super rude of them to keep you waiting because they were late. It\u2019s not like it was an emergency. \nThey also already knew about the party, and planned the dinner anyway.\nGood for your husband for sticking up for you in the end. I hope he puts his foot down sooner next time.", "Hard NTA.

Top marks to you and your hubby, and I hope your son has better future birthdays without the outlaws.", "NTA - the nerve someones got to have to be upset over this is beyond me. You tried to accommodate them several times. You went above and beyond what's reasonable to expect, pushed back the party several times and they still failed to even show up at a reasonable time. then they show up to yell at you when your three year olds gone to bed. Tell them to f off and stop trying to please them. They're obviously oblivious to what respectful and civil manners are. It's not your job to teach them. It sucks for your husband but his family is not the center of the universe.", "NTA\n\nGet the hell outta dodge. It's not going to get better and nothing you nor your husband does will EVER satisfy them.", "NTA, the good news is you married a man who's firm on standing up to them.

What a bunch of toxic selfish a-hole. You don't want your child growing up around them.", "NTA your hubby was the scapegoat now you are. It is illogical.

Please, for the love of everything that is good in this wretched World, move as far away as possible. If you don't they will infect your life like the virulent fungus they so clearly are. If you can't do it for the sake of your own happiness and sanity, then do it for your son.
