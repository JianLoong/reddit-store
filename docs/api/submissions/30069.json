He bought the tickets and just assumed they'd take care of his kid despite being told repeatedly that they're not willing to be baby sitters.  I'd be more sympathetic to him if he'd asked before buying tickets and if he'd lined up as much baby sitting as possible so there wasn't much for his parents to do.  Instead, he tried to dump his kid on them as a done deal because he'd already spent his money on tickets and accomodations.

Nanna!\" and \"Ugh, parenting is so haaaaaard.\" One thing I'd lay off on though- he chose to have sex, it doesn't sound like they planned a baby. Once she was pregnant and wanted to keep it he had two choices, this or put the kid up for adoption. I really feel for guys who don't want to be fathers and get forced to be because the contraception fails. If that's him and he's not the 'never mind the condom, it won't happen to me' guy, maybe pivot to 'You made the right choice raising your son, but this is the cost of that.'", "Nta he is being entitled.

No.", "Give Vegas strippers more credit than that, you don't maintain a job like that being a schmuck about having unprotected sex with broke tourists.\n\nNothing against broke tourists lol!", "While I support op, that\u2019s an idiotic argument.", "\"Want a weekend off? Stop loving your kid!\" LOL. My generation spent *every weekend* at our grandparents house. The commenter is right, grandparents don't care about their grandkids now, but they didn't really care about their kids either so it shouldn't be surprising."]}
