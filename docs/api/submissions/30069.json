It\u2019s clear that Jay has been struggling with being a father but that was his choice. \n\nHe asked me to watch his kid while he goes on a boys trip to Vegas over NYE.

We are both exhausted on our days off and do not want the extra duties of child care for a toddler. \n\nJay works part-time in retail store and is maybe about 30 hours a week but it should go up hours around the holidays.  He wanted to spend NYE in Vegas and got tickets without talking to us with the expectation we\u2019ll watch his son. \n\nBoth me and his father said no he should be saving his money for his own place.

That\u2019s just how things are. \n\nJay angered at us and has been moody around the house saying most people love to be grandparents but I feel like it would be different if we didn\u2019t still work fulltime and had to provide a roof for an ungrateful son and Nick.", "created_utc": 1698779563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kstwn/aita_for_refusing_to_watch_my_grandkids/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What he *needs* from you is a *favor* but he seems to think he's owed something here.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't give in to this kind of entitlement. If he'd *asked you* and made plans with your blessing, that's one thing, but that isn't what happened. What happened is your kid fucked around and now he's finding out. Parenting is hard.", ">Jay was upset and said it\u2019s not fair that he doesn\u2019t get time to his self to hang out and do boys stuff.\n\nVegas is not boys stuff. He can't afford Vegas.

We do it willingly because we can and it is acknowledged and appreciated. Even thinking about leaving his child without your buy-in from the outset was wrong. Jay is a father. Single or not, that means that there are things that he used to do, that he cannot do any more.

He shouldn't have assumed; but you sound terribly unsupportive. It's one trip. He has a 3yo and needs a break too. Sucks you're parents couldn't help you; but you're choosing not to break that pattern.", "ESH. (Probably unpopular opinions incoming)\n\nYes, you\u2019re right it was his decision to become a father. And you are under no obligation to watch him full time, nobody can necessarily blame you. He also shouldn\u2019t have expected it. \n\nBut on the other hand, as a parent yourself, you could take into consideration what he\u2019s going through and if a trip would do him good. I recognize that caring for child isn\u2019t really the easiest favor to do somebody, but if this is like, your son\u2019s one big ask of the year, I can see why he\u2019s a bit angry.", "INFO: your ages and at what point did you realize you hate your son?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sure. Extra hours at work? If you can swing it. But a trip to Vegas? Absolutely not. \n\nI'd be worried he'd bring home a pregnant stripper.\n\nNothing against strippers.", "He didn't ask.  He bought the tickets and just assumed they'd take care of his kid despite being told repeatedly that they're not willing to be baby sitters.  I'd be more sympathetic to him if he'd asked before buying tickets and if he'd lined up as much baby sitting as possible so there wasn't much for his parents to do.  Instead, he tried to dump his kid on them as a done deal because he'd already spent his money on tickets and accomodations.  On top of that, holidays are very difficult for most nurses to get time off for, especially NYE, so either his father has to do everything or his mother has to spend one of her rare holidays off helping taking care of the grandkid.", "They are helping him.

He obviously doesn't have money to support himself and his child but it's okay to blow what money he does have on a trip to Vegas? Have you ever been to Vegas?
