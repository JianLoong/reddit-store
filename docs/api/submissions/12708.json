He has a friend group of 10 ppl. 3 girls, 7 guys. They have been saving up for a big trip away together in a few weeks' time.   House is booked, etc, by my bf and the plane tickets too. Some still need to pay.  \n\nThe issue here is that Kaitlyn 25F has been in love with my bf for some time now. They once were fwb 2 years ago,  but he stopped it because he didn't see the point anymore. After a month, she confessed her feelings, and my bf shut her down.  She has a lot of mental issues and won't address any of them.  Very confrontation avoiding.  \n\nMy bf invited me along on the trip.  I've met everyone except for Kaitlyn because she doesn't want to meet me. It'll be too hard for her to see me and my bf together is the explanation we got.  Everyone loves me and is super excited, so yeey. We asked everyone if they were okay with me coming along, but Kaitlyn never responded or said anything for weeks.\n\n\nLast week, she told my bf in privat that  she won't be joining because it would be a waste of her money and days off feeling shitty. She wanted my bf to rebook her ticket to me.  Apparentl,  this was all a show,  and she's not okay with not going but is just causing drama and wants the group to dislike me. \n\nLast night there was a party. Kaitlyn was there and walked away when she saw me. 2 of his friends are pro Kaitlyn ish and have told my bf several times she was included in the plans first, so we have to adapt to her feelings, aka I shouldn't be going for her sake.  \n\nIt makes me feel angry and sad when it isn't even my problem. When they said the same thing again, I flat out told the 2 friends it's not my problem she can't deal with her feelings and to get over herself already because I'm not going anywhere.  \nApparently, she heard it because shortly after, we heard someone crying very loud in the bathroom. She left with the 2 friends, and my bf and I got judging looks by the ppl who witnessed everything. \n\nMy bf thinks I'm right, this is not my fault at all and that the 2 friends are just feeling sorry for Kaitlyn. His friends are divided. I'm sick of it all and am wondering if I was an Ahole or what the best plan of action is here..", "created_utc": 1679246530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vr7c2/aita_i_told_a_girl_of_my_bfs_friendgroup_its_not/", "score": 296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get that she used to sleep with your BF YEARS ago, but she needs to grow up. He moved on and is now with you. You deserve to be included in the group, and Kaitlyn needs to understand that. She can't avoid you forever and demand that the friend group always cater to her.\n\nIf she truly isn't over your BF, then she needs to go and separate from him. You and your BF didn't do anything. She is the one who can't control her emotions.\n\nIt's not like you're trying to kick Kaitlyn out of the group.", "You are correct, it is not your problem to deal with. If she can't handle seeing you and your bf together, then she needs to distance herself from him until she can get over him.\n\nNTA", "NTA...... She needs to GTFU! She's not 10 and neither are the other friends. Bf needs to stand up and let everyone know that you are part of his life and that you are going and if anyone has a problem with it and is not comfortable then they don't need come. You're not in grade school.", "Tell the friend group the issue and let them know that you and your BF have no problem with Kaitlyn, and her inability to accept that you and your BF are a couple is not your fault or problem. Ask how to address this problem in the future.\n\n I hate to think that the friend group would fracture over this. It sometimes happens in divorce where a couple's friends choose one spouse or the other to remain friends with. This wasn't a several yearlong marriage and shouldn't have gotten to be this big of a deal. Kaitlyn probably needs counseling if she is this torn up years after their relationship ended.", "NTA, you are not responsible for any unrequited feelings towards your bf as is he and everyone else in your friend circle. I am suprised she still has an audience after two years. It's pretty shitty and extremely immature of her to create so much drama around her bs and expect you and your bf to cater to her entitled wishes and not participating in the trip.", "NTA\n\nEdit: Also this is your BFs problem to deal with his friends. Not yours. If it were me, I would tell his friends that if they have a problem they should take it up with him and you\u2019re not getting in the middle of it. It\u2019a frankly unfair to do to direct all this at you. And your BF needs to step up and handle this.", "NTA, Kaitlyn does need to get over this.\n\nBut at the same time, I think some of this is exagerration by those two (2) friends.\n\nKaitlyn already said she can't go for the reasons she mentioned.\n\n\"Apparentl, this was all a show, and she's not okay with not going but is just causing drama and wants the group to dislike me\".  This I don't buy.  I think whoever told you this / two (2) friends are either instigating more drama out of you or are misreading what Kaitlyn told them, and would be careful.  Unless you hear something from Kaitlyn's mouth herself, don't feed into what the others are saying, because its hearsay until comes out of Kaitlyn's own mouth.  I would still remember this Kaitlyn person is still getting over her feelings.  She may still be mad at the situation that she can't go, but I really doubt that she purposely wants the group to start disliking you, this sounds like hearsay drama to me.", "nta", "NTA! Its time for her to move on and stop being bitter!", "NTA \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this drama within the friend group however your boyfriend is TA.\n\nThere are obviously unaddressed hurt and feelings by Kaitlyn and their friends are right, she was in the friend group first. This being said their anger should not be directed at you. Your boyfriend played with Kaitlyn\u2019s feelings and has continued to be her \u201cfriend\u201d knowing her feelings and their history. There should be boundaries and even a discussion fully outlining that he truly doesn\u2019t have feelings for her. It seems to me that your boyfriend has strung her along for 2 years and just expected for everything to be fine and dandy and her not to be hurt. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have mentioned her mental health because honestly I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with what\u2019s currently going on. \n\nI feel like you should reevaluate your boyfriend because his insensitivity to another woman that he used to have some semblance of relationship with and his blatant disrespect and disregard should be appalling to you and a red flag. \n\nAnyway you are NTA you could have said what you said in a more polite and respectful manner but overall you shouldn\u2019t be excluded from a trip because your boyfriend and kaitlyn haven\u2019t had the discussions they need to have and he hasn\u2019t inserted the boundaries necessary", "i don't know if the asshole here is your boyfriend or Kaitlyn (or both), but either way it isn't you so NTA.", "NTA. She sounds like a total mess. I feel sorry for any future romantic partner she gets. Go on the trip and do not worry about her at all.", "Idk why your bf isn\u2019t standing up for you that\u2019s really shitty. Also the girl sounds like a huge baby.", "NTA - OP you all are too old to be dealing with middle school drama. I'm 99% sure Kaitlyn was going to use this vacation as an excuse to find her self in a promiscuous situation with your BF, have evidence and then use it to ruin your relationship with BF. However, since you're going with them, you'll likely be spending the most time with him, which are ruining her plans.", "NTA she sounds exactly like that one preschooler who\u2019s been playing with someone else\u2019s jump rope and is throwing a tantrum when the owner, not only takes it back but let\u2019s someone else play with it.\n\nShe needs to grow up and deal with her feelings like a responsible adult\u2026. Or possibly she needs a juice box and a nap. From what you told it sounds just as possible. \n\n(You will never know how much restraint I had to use to not say balls and chose jump rope instead)", "Is your boyfriend not expected to ever have a girlfriend after her?  I ask because excluding you implies that your boyfriend is obligated to her forever; as if they were married and he cheated on her but didn\u2019t divorce her", "ESH: she has mental issues she needs to address you said that yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s not your problem you\u2019re are correct about that, but now you\u2019re causing drama in the friend group.\n\nYour bf needs to either lose contact with this girl or risk losing 3 if not his entire friend group. \n\nYou\u2019re in one heck of a sticky situation here and hope things work out for the better rather than the worse", "I'm going to have to say YTA. Your attitude towards her and you not wanting to empathize with her makes you TA, especially when you say it's because of 'mental issues' and is 'avoiding of confrontation'. So what? It seems like you can be a bit much as you take her leaving a situation as an insult. She's still showing emotional maturity to take time to herself. \n\nMaybe your boyfriend also a bit of AH.\n\nShe IS getting over it, in her own way and falling out of love takes time. You've been with the guy for 5 months and she's been in love for over 2 years. Give her some time. \n\nIt isn't your problem, but you insulting her and continuing to shove yourself into her view makes you apart of the problem. Of course she wanted to go on the trip, but her health and his and your fun were put first. If she wanted drama, she would've gone, but she is keeping to herself and her friends to get over it. \n\nLastly, *her* friends have no obligation to be on your side because you're a friend's girlfriend. They know her more than you and you cannot ask them to disregard her. You designating them as only his friends is also strange. She isn't inviting herself, she gets invited by her friends.\n\nSure, you're in your mid 20's, but you all are *humans* with *feelings*. Respect them.\n\nI hope eventually you apologize to Kaitlyn and actually get to know her once she's better.\n\nINFO to help further judgement : \nWhat makes you think she wants drama when her friends are backing her up?\nWhen did you do the 1 on 1?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It doesn't matter if \"she was included in plans first\". Your bf booked everything, so if that isnt reason enough for him to bring his literal gf along then idk what is.

As of now it\u2019s a you vs kaitlin issue. This needs to be and you and your boyfriend vs Kaitlin\u2019s drama. Right now they think they can push you out in favor of Kaitlin\u2019s feelings, they need to know if their gonna make a choice then it\u2019s between your boyfriend and Kaitlin not you and her. He needs to tell them if you\u2019re not invited (to anything really because of her) he\u2019s not going. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019ll incentivize the group to stop catering to her and make her get over it. Worst case even if it doesn\u2019t go the way you planned atleast you and your boyfriend are drama free and she knows her pity party isn\u2019t going to be rewarded (by the group forcing you out of everything and your boyfriend going without you because that\u2019s what she wants) and you and her don\u2019t have to be in the same room again.

She agreed to the trip based on the ppl going when it was first being organized, and now OP and her bf want to change that up. Like, it's great that they asked if everyone was okay with it, but then that means that if even one person isn't okay with it, you either don't go or reimburse them if you decide to go through with it.

She left the situation.\n\nHer friends aren't being driven away either, they're fighting for her which is most of the drama but they're not AH for it as the trip was planned for the previous group and not for a surprised guest, as far as we know.", "Fair, but we don't know what she was doing in those weeks-if she was talking it through with the other members, if she was taking the time to come to a decision, if she was simply unable to respond. It certainly would have been better for her to say something right away, but they still have time before the vacation.", "I think you lack reading comprehension. The trip has not happened yet. That girl is being Wishy washy stirring up drama before a trip that they have all been looking forward to for a while. Again I don\u2019t see how the bf is in any way the asshole, they were -friends with benefits- that is it. He doesn\u2019t owe her anything and she is holding on and making everyone miserable. If she\u2019s not running her mouth then she needs to get her sympathizers in line and tell them to stop harassing his gf because she has done nothing wrong.

He most likely hasn't had a proper conversation with K before and only is doing so because of dating OP. That's why I say he may also be the AH. \n\nHer *friends* are \"miserable\" because they want K and not OP on the trip. K isn't doing the guilt tripping and it barely is that. She explained herself and left a very involved trip, and her friends are reasonable upset on loosing her for OP they barely know but says that they 'love' her. \n\nJust like boyfriend doesn't owe her anything, K doesn't owe him anything.\n\nBoyfriend is also the one that added K into the conversation by saying she is his friend when she hangs out with her friends that also happen to be his.

K might not have even actively pined for those two years, but found she still likes him once OP started dating him. \n\nThere is no hell here. This is about one trip and about OP wanting to converse with K because she's boyfriend's 'friend' and K not wanting to. That is K's choice, and like him not owing her anything, K does not owe OP or boyfriend anything. \n\nThis is K's moment to move on, but it is being publicly criticized by OP and boyfriend.\n\nEveryone else in this thread is defending OP without knowing her as well, and I am trying to see it from both sides from what is given. The side I've seen more error from was OP's.\n\nI have known someone in a similar position as the fence. Eventually, they come to terms with their feelings, but they had the luck of having an actually *good* friend and them having a *nice* SO that gave their space and spoke about. \n\nThe growing up that needs to happen is OP and the boyfriend. \n\nHave a good day/night", "ESH.

I am sure that she thought this trip (without you along) would give her the opportunity to refresh his memory of their  time together, and when you were included, she could not find any other way to get him to see the error of his ways. So she bailed, hoping  to see him beg for her not to cancel, and to put him in a bad financial situation hoping this would lead to the outcome she was hoping for (ie...you excluded from the trip).  Kudos to you and your boyfriend for not allowing either to happen. But she has had 2 others in the group reinforcing her belief that he would return her feelings if you were not along for the trip. He should clear up this misunderstanding prior to the vacation to alleviate any tension directed toward you.", "Thank you! Switch the genders and this would be a no brainer.  I also agree that this whole situation sounds like college freshmen drama - I had to double check the posted ages. \n\nThere were certainly better ways for OP to handle the situation,  so I think maybe ESH.  That woman is way too old to be sobbing at a party because her former FWB/crush has a girlfriend.  OP got the guy; there's no reason to twist the knife and give the friend group ammunition against her. And frankly,  the BF here should be the one putting a stop to the drama within the friend group.", "This. ^^ \nYou could of also said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make her feel uncomfortable. She didn\u2019t say anything when we asked everyone was ok with me coming. So we assumed she was fine\u201d.\nUnkind responses usually lead to more drama.", "No, doing separate stuff will eventually cause a rift between bf and his friend group, and they will slowly turn on OP.  If OP is playing the long game, the best bet is to be overly nice to the other girl whenever she\u2019s around and to never say anything about her or the situation other than I know she has a problem with me, but I don\u2019t have any problem with her, and I hope we can all be friends some day.", "ESH you got baited and said something that could be held against you. It's not unreasonable for her friends of many years to want to cater to her feelings no matter how illogical it might be. You're a plus one on a friend trip, you could at least have more tack and let your bf deal with this without hurting her further.", "NTA, she really needs to grow up and you said what needed to be said", "NTA. She's manipulative.", "They\u2019ve been friends for years, you\u2019ve been around for 5 months. Of course they\u2019re gonna want their friend to go over you. Doesn\u2019t sound like Kaitlyn has done anything to offend you besides avoiding you. If this is how you\u2019re gonna treat their friend, I don\u2019t see this friend group lasting much longer.", "NTA. But it really sounds like you shouldn\u2019t go on this trip. I wouldn\u2019t trust these people or your boyfriend. This sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. You\u2019ve only been seeing this guy for 4 months and his friends seem to relish in the drama. Don\u2019t get too roped up into random friend group drama over a relationship that isn\u2019t going to last (if that\u2019s the case).", "This is a little unfair. OP is new to the group and is feeling uninclcuded by a girl she hasn't even properly met. It would be very easy after hearing comments like this prior to start getting fed up. \n\nIf Kaitlyn is so hung up with a guy she was never in a relationship with, she maybe shouldn't have agreed to go on a trip with him. He is allowed to have a significant other. \n\nI can understand that sucks for her, but she needs to be an adult and either deal with it or remove herself from the situation. OP shouldn't feel ostracized from something that doesn't involve her/happened before she was in the picture.", "Y\u2019all are too old to be having these sorts of high school issues. Everyone needs to grow up.", "YTA - might be an unpopular opinion but the way this reads I have mean girl vibes from OP. Kaitlyn has her own issues to deal with but to cut her down in front of her friends (you\u2019re just a tag along) isn\u2019t the way to go about it either. Not a good look for you if you think they all love you \u2026 until your true colours come out.  Total mean girl vibes.", "NTA but\u2026\n\nHave you considered reaching out to her and apologise. Maybe try to understand her and how you can interact in the group. Making it clear that you are not going anywhere but also don\u2019t want to cause her any pain. Also record this conversation so she can\u2019t twist it. \n\nMake an effort to be kind. You have said she has some issues she isn\u2019t getting help for. I am sure this contributes massively to her fixation and those 2 friends are feeding it.", "nta your bf rlly needs to step up and seriously address this w his friends and maybe kaitlyn in private that he is uncomfortable w all this", "NTA. You're adults, this isn't high school. If she's willing to give up a vacation with her friends because one person she doesn't like will be there, that's her business.", "Your boyfriend should make his decision soon. His obsessed friend or you-his girlfriend. He may lose some friends along the way but he'll realise it's for the best. I cut off a guy friend of mine -who was in love with me- because he wasn't a fan of my boyfriend at the time. He started to turn the whole friend group against him and implied everyone that my bf stole me from him. I am only friends with 2 person from that friend group now (a group of 8 people)", "INFO: Are other people bringing their partners?", ">If Kaitlyn is so hung up with a guy she was never in a relationship with, she maybe shouldn't have agreed to go on a trip with him. He is allowed to have a significant other.\n\nAgreed. Also, the whole dynamic of the two friends siding with Kaitlyn when OP's bf clearly doesn't want her is toxic. They might just not want to see the divide among Kaitlyn and the bf but they are clearly  enabling Kaitlyn's toxic behavior and treating OP as an outsider.\n\nOP, whether you go or not, I wouldn't be comfortable with the bf going on a trip with these friends and Kaitlyn was there. They might try to set up your bf with Kaitlyn.\n\nNTA", "This sounds like high school drama, good lord! \nKaitlyn needs to get over herself and maybe distance herself from the group or you and bf need to find a new friend group.", "I'm going to say NTA, ya'll rich? Cus this all sounds like some rich people made up problem stuff.", "Yes 3 of them + one of them are just dating 1 month now", "Ofc it didn't start this way immediately.  It had been going on for weeks.  At first I told my bf yeah I get her totally and I wouldn't want to intrude on already made plans.  I've had feelings a few times for people that weren't answered and it hurt a lot. The thing is that I removed myself as their friend to heal and later on we got to be friends again once I didn't have feelings anymore.  I kind of expected Kaitlyn to do the same mature thing. I've tried to meet her 1 on 1, I've tried to exclude myself from the beginning but every time I hang out with the friends group the 2 ppl start to bash in on my bf with me next to it.  Saying it isn't fair to Kaitlyn etc.  This was maybe the 6th time they did this and I just had a breaking point. She is more than welcome by me and my bf and I'm willing to accompany her feelings by being more platonic in her presence, but nothing from her.  \n\nSo yeah I've tried to be nice and to be super understanding and the real problem are those 2 friends who are constantly \"standing up for her because she doesn't dare to herself\"\n\nMy bf is telling me it isn't my fault at all and he tried to deal with it by bringing up many solutions to Kaitlyn but she just went into victim mode. We offered to buy her ticket, to meet up front honestly enough..\n\nSo this is the aftermath of it all", "Maybe this is what Kaitlyn is working towards: the fantasy that if OP doesn\u2019t go on the trip, she can shoot her shot and OP\u2019s boyfriend will realize Kaitlyn is his soul mate.", "Kaitlyn likely thought FWB would lead to him falling for her and miscalculated", "What is your boyfriend doing in all of this? My cousin went LC with childhood friends who wouldn\u2019t stop making rude remarks about his then-girlfriend (now wife). He used his words very clearly: \u201cStop badmouthing [girlfriend], and our relationship isn\u2019t any of your business anyways. Stay out of it.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t, so cue their surprise when my cousin blocked them, and was merely polite at mutual friends\u2019 events.\n\nYour bf should be the one shutting this down, and leaving them behind if they refuse to be respectful.", "She hasn't bought anything yet, it is all on my bf his name.  Just rebooking the ticket is 150 for me.", "If they had this trip planned for so long then he shouldn\u2019t have invited you and you shouldn\u2019t go since obviously someone in the original group isn\u2019t okay with you going regardless of how stupid the reason is."]}
