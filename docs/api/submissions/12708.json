He has a friend group of 10 ppl. 3 girls, 7 guys. They have been saving up for a big trip away together in a few weeks' time.   House is booked, etc, by my bf and the plane tickets too. Some still need to pay.  \n\nThe issue here is that Kaitlyn 25F has been in love with my bf for some time now. They once were fwb 2 years ago,  but he stopped it because he didn't see the point anymore. After a month, she confessed her feelings, and my bf shut her down.  She has a lot of mental issues and won't address any of them.  Very confrontation avoiding.  \n\nMy bf invited me along on the trip.  I've met everyone except for Kaitlyn because she doesn't want to meet me. It'll be too hard for her to see me and my bf together is the explanation we got.  Everyone loves me and is super excited, so yeey. We asked everyone if they were okay with me coming along, but Kaitlyn never responded or said anything for weeks.\n\n\nLast week, she told my bf in privat that  she won't be joining because it would be a waste of her money and days off feeling shitty. She wanted my bf to rebook her ticket to me.  Apparentl,  this was all a show,  and she's not okay with not going but is just causing drama and wants the group to dislike me. \n\nLast night there was a party. Kaitlyn was there and walked away when she saw me. 2 of his friends are pro Kaitlyn ish and have told my bf several times she was included in the plans first, so we have to adapt to her feelings, aka I shouldn't be going for her sake.  \n\nIt makes me feel angry and sad when it isn't even my problem. When they said the same thing again, I flat out told the 2 friends it's not my problem she can't deal with her feelings and to get over herself already because I'm not going anywhere.  \nApparently, she heard it because shortly after, we heard someone crying very loud in the bathroom. She left with the 2 friends, and my bf and I got judging looks by the ppl who witnessed everything. \n\nMy bf thinks I'm right, this is not my fault at all and that the 2 friends are just feeling sorry for Kaitlyn. His friends are divided. I'm sick of it all and am wondering if I was an Ahole or what the best plan of action is here..", "created_utc": 1679246530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vr7c2/aita_i_told_a_girl_of_my_bfs_friendgroup_its_not/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get that she used to sleep with your BF YEARS ago, but she needs to grow up. He moved on and is now with you. You deserve to be included in the group, and Kaitlyn needs to understand that. She can't avoid you forever and demand that the friend group always cater to her.\n\nIf she truly isn't over your BF, then she needs to go and separate from him. You and your BF didn't do anything. She is the one who can't control her emotions.\n\nIt's not like you're trying to kick Kaitlyn out of the group.", "You are correct, it is not your problem to deal with. If she can't handle seeing you and your bf together, then she needs to distance herself from him until she can get over him.\n\nNTA", "NTA...... She needs to GTFU! She's not 10 and neither are the other friends. Bf needs to stand up and let everyone know that you are part of his life and that you are going and if anyone has a problem with it and is not comfortable then they don't need come. You're not in grade school.", "Tell the friend group the issue and let them know that you and your BF have no problem with Kaitlyn, and her inability to accept that you and your BF are a couple is not your fault or problem. Ask how to address this problem in the future.\n\n I hate to think that the friend group would fracture over this. It sometimes happens in divorce where a couple's friends choose one spouse or the other to remain friends with. This wasn't a several yearlong marriage and shouldn't have gotten to be this big of a deal. Kaitlyn probably needs counseling if she is this torn up years after their relationship ended.", "NTA, you are not responsible for any unrequited feelings towards your bf as is he and everyone else in your friend circle. I am suprised she still has an audience after two years. It's pretty shitty and extremely immature of her to create so much drama around her bs and expect you and your bf to cater to her entitled wishes and not participating in the trip.", "NTA\n\nEdit: Also this is your BFs problem to deal with his friends. Not yours. If it were me, I would tell his friends that if they have a problem they should take it up with him and you\u2019re not getting in the middle of it. It\u2019a frankly unfair to do to direct all this at you. And your BF needs to step up and handle this.", "NTA, Kaitlyn does need to get over this.\n\nBut at the same time, I think some of this is exagerration by those two (2) friends.\n\nKaitlyn already said she can't go for the reasons she mentioned.\n\n\"Apparentl, this was all a show, and she's not okay with not going but is just causing drama and wants the group to dislike me\".  This I don't buy.  I think whoever told you this / two (2) friends are either instigating more drama out of you or are misreading what Kaitlyn told them, and would be careful.  Unless you hear something from Kaitlyn's mouth herself, don't feed into what the others are saying, because its hearsay until comes out of Kaitlyn's own mouth.  I would still remember this Kaitlyn person is still getting over her feelings.  She may still be mad at the situation that she can't go, but I really doubt that she purposely wants the group to start disliking you, this sounds like hearsay drama to me.", "nta", "NTA! Its time for her to move on and stop being bitter!", "NTA \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this drama within the friend group however your boyfriend is TA.\n\nThere are obviously unaddressed hurt and feelings by Kaitlyn and their friends are right, she was in the friend group first. This being said their anger should not be directed at you. Your boyfriend played with Kaitlyn\u2019s feelings and has continued to be her \u201cfriend\u201d knowing her feelings and their history. There should be boundaries and even a discussion fully outlining that he truly doesn\u2019t have feelings for her. It seems to me that your boyfriend has strung her along for 2 years and just expected for everything to be fine and dandy and her not to be hurt. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have mentioned her mental health because honestly I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with what\u2019s currently going on. \n\nI feel like you should reevaluate your boyfriend because his insensitivity to another woman that he used to have some semblance of relationship with and his blatant disrespect and disregard should be appalling to you and a red flag. \n\nAnyway you are NTA you could have said what you said in a more polite and respectful manner but overall you shouldn\u2019t be excluded from a trip because your boyfriend and kaitlyn haven\u2019t had the discussions they need to have and he hasn\u2019t inserted the boundaries necessary", "i don't know if the asshole here is your boyfriend or Kaitlyn (or both), but either way it isn't you so NTA.", "NTA. She sounds like a total mess. I feel sorry for any future romantic partner she gets. Go on the trip and do not worry about her at all.", "Idk why your bf isn\u2019t standing up for you that\u2019s really shitty. Also the girl sounds like a huge baby.", "NTA - OP you all are too old to be dealing with middle school drama. I'm 99% sure Kaitlyn was going to use this vacation as an excuse to find her self in a promiscuous situation with your BF, have evidence and then use it to ruin your relationship with BF. However, since you're going with them, you'll likely be spending the most time with him, which are ruining her plans.", "NTA she sounds exactly like that one preschooler who\u2019s been playing with someone else\u2019s jump rope and is throwing a tantrum when the owner, not only takes it back but let\u2019s someone else play with it.\n\nShe needs to grow up and deal with her feelings like a responsible adult\u2026. Or possibly she needs a juice box and a nap. From what you told it sounds just as possible. \n\n(You will never know how much restraint I had to use to not say balls and chose jump rope instead)", "Is your boyfriend not expected to ever have a girlfriend after her?  I ask because excluding you implies that your boyfriend is obligated to her forever; as if they were married and he cheated on her but didn\u2019t divorce her", "ESH: she has mental issues she needs to address you said that yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s not your problem you\u2019re are correct about that, but now you\u2019re causing drama in the friend group.\n\nYour bf needs to either lose contact with this girl or risk losing 3 if not his entire friend group. \n\nYou\u2019re in one heck of a sticky situation here and hope things work out for the better rather than the worse", "I'm going to have to say YTA. Your attitude towards her and you not wanting to empathize with her makes you TA, especially when you say it's because of 'mental issues' and is 'avoiding of confrontation'. So what? It seems like you can be a bit much as you take her leaving a situation as an insult. She's still showing emotional maturity to take time to herself. \n\nMaybe your boyfriend also a bit of AH.\n\nShe IS getting over it, in her own way and falling out of love takes time. You've been with the guy for 5 months and she's been in love for over 2 years. Give her some time. \n\nIt isn't your problem, but you insulting her and continuing to shove yourself into her view makes you apart of the problem. Of course she wanted to go on the trip, but her health and his and your fun were put first. If she wanted drama, she would've gone, but she is keeping to herself and her friends to get over it. \n\nLastly, *her* friends have no obligation to be on your side because you're a friend's girlfriend. They know her more than you and you cannot ask them to disregard her. You designating them as only his friends is also strange. She isn't inviting herself, she gets invited by her friends.\n\nSure, you're in your mid 20's, but you all are *humans* with *feelings*. Respect them.\n\nI hope eventually you apologize to Kaitlyn and actually get to know her once she's better.\n\nINFO to help further judgement : \nWhat makes you think she wants drama when her friends are backing her up?\nWhen did you do the 1 on 1?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

By hanging out with her friends? How is she sabotaging the relationship when she is separating herself from it? She is confiding in her friends that so happen to be his and it is their choice to be on her side.\n\nI never said he doesn't 'deserve' to be happy. I'm contemplating on him being the AH by the description of OP.", "Yeah honestly they had this trip planned for months if not years. It's not often they are together with everyone.  This drama is the reason why I normally go on trips alone or with small tight knit groups but yeah.  The trip and the house they booked is great+ the house is so big you'll probably won't see everyone every day."]}
