If you have a joking relationship with them and they'll find it funny go for it. If not, they may not have known your shirt size and didn't want to offend by guessing something too large or too small or maybe they thought it just wasn't your style and you wouldn't like it.

YTA", "YTA\n\nWtf...they got your husband a junk souvenir T SHIRT! And you're offended?? What kind of middle school bs is this.\n\nYou're actually scheming against them over a 15 dollar shirt that says Arizona and has an animal on it. Grow up.\n\nUnless you have a horrible history with them, they probably didn't know your size or didn't think it was your style. Jesus lady, you're pathetic.", "YWBTA. That is so over the top petty, good grief. Let it go. What do you hope to accomplish by doing that?", "YTA  Nice burn though.", "INFO: What was the candy bar? Was it just some common one that you can get anywhere or was it something unique from that area? Are you someone with a sweet tooth?", "YTA\n\nEven as a joke you are creating an awkward situation.  If nothing else you would spend way too much time convincing your in laws you were joking but to no avail.", "NAH unless they routinely single you out as different from everyone else. \n\nI could imagine them at the t-shirt shop at the airport: \"Quick hun, find something for each of them. I can't believe we forgot to go shopping the whole time.\" \"What do you mean you are out of anything with a nice picture in medium?!\" \"I know, she likes candy! We can get her an Arizona candy bar!\"\n\nOf course, if they regularly treat you differently and you want to make a point, you could have your husband and kids all wear their Arizona shirts and you wear one from your current state. It gives the same message but is harder to claim you did it on purpose.", "YTA. This is petty, and you know it.", "Why not just wear the shirt they bought your husband?", "OP let it go because you don't need the bad mojo that it'll bring.  The in-laws were petty for the candy bar and throwing it back in their faces will just make it worse.  Take the high road for your husband and children's sakes.", "YTFA I hope they have a sense of humor cause that's funny as shit. Just to be clear, it's a Your The FUNNY Asshole. I would do it, maybe it'll be awkward for a bit, but I feel like y'all would have to grow stronger from it", "Yeah YWBTA most definitely", "ESH.\n\nLet's be clear: they're not obliged to buy anyone anything. But it's fairly pointed rudeness when they buy gifts for your husband and your kids that are considerably more thoughtful than what they bought you. So they are AHs, no doubt.\n\nBut you would be TA too if you retaliated in this petty way.\n\nSo far, you are N-T-A. You can stay N-T-A by not stooping to their level.\n\nIf this was the first time they've ever done anything like this, I'd let it go.\n\nBut if it is part of a general pattern of behavior, where they often treat you as a second-class citizen compared to your husband and kids, then he should have a serious talk with them. They're his family; he should be the one to deal with them.", "NTA \n\nWear the shirt and bring a can of Arizona iced tea. Tell the in-laws that the drink is to wash down the candy bar they so generously gifted you.", "esh. I can't believe they'd get everyone else a t-shirt and single you out like that. But you would be just as bad doing the shirt thing.", "I mean.  Yeah. You would be TA, but you\u2019d be in good company since apparently your in-laws are as well. \nWould that stop me from doing it?  Nope.

All names of people and cities/towns have been changed.\n\nSeveral decades ago, I was looking to buy a house with my then-partner, whom I'll call Chris. Chris had grown up in a very white-bread place I'll call Whiteville.\n\nWe were having dinner with Chris's family in Whiteville:\n\nChris: \"... and we've found this very appealing place in Diversity City. We're going to inspect it tomorrow.\"\n\nChris's dad: \"Why on earth would you want to buy in Diversity City? It's full of \\[insert racial slur\\]!\"\n\nI was speechless that someone would talk like that. I honestly don't remember what happened next, I was so shocked. I think someone changed the subject.\n\nI was telling a friend about it not long after. They said \"You should have responded with 'Well, we did consider buying a house in Whiteville, but we decided against it. It's full of bigots!' \"\n\nEven if I'd thought of it, I probably would have been the AH if I'd actually said it, and relationships with my in-laws, already a bit frosty, would have plummeted even further.\n\nBut gee, it would have felt good. I'll just imagine there's a parallel universe where I did say it.", "How did your husband react to you getting a crappy gift?", "Good perspective.

I just can't risk it!", "Yeah, it could be a nice fantasy. I don't have to actually live it. \n\nThat is crazy that he said that!

And make sure that you're all wearing the shirts.  \n\nNo judgement either way.", "YWBTA- But there's a germ of an idea there, and I've got ya. What you are looking for here is actually a t-shirt that says 'Zoo Keeper'. There you go MIL, your son's a wolf, your grandkids are a cute lizard and a little bear, and your daughter in law is the boss. Subtle, but you're still 'completing the set' for a daft but cute family photo and it's more of a joke that adds on to their gifts than an 'F you'. TBF they probably thought you had too much personal style to be wearing rando souvenir t-shirts with animals on from trips you didn't go on, I mean if they had got you one would you have worn it for more than one family photo and sleeping in? It's a fine line between 'retro cheesy on purpose' and 'just tacky' even if you are a t-shirt person. It doesn't merit a truly petty gesture, just a punchline.", "YWNBTA.

So I\u2019d be way happier with the candy bar and wouldn\u2019t see it as offensive at all, I\u2019d be happy my in laws actually thought of me and what I\u2019d like.

You have already discussed it with them, they have already joked about it with you, and it has just become a silly in-joke to you. \n\nIn other situations it could be taken as an insult, and seen as just twisting the knife more and holding a grudge.\n\nPersonally I would err on the side of caution.
