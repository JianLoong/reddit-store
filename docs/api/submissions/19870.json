I swear that every single souvenir shirt for women is a different cut and size. I literally have souvenir shirts that range in \"size\" from medium to 3xl that fit the exact same. As a result of that, I don't usually have the ability to buy my female people shirts in a specific size and know they will fit. I am much more likely to buy them something like a funky candy bar.

There's could be many reasons they didn't buy you a shirt.  I hate buying my DIL's clothing because of sizing concerns and tastes.  They didn't forget you or leave you out.
