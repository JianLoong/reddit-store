Outside in the parking lot, there is a handicap spot with a sign underneath that says \u201cReserved for 100.\u201d Well, she\u2019s no longer here and since I now live in 100, I park in the space everyday.\n\nA few weeks ago, a woman moved into the building next to me and I noticed that she started parking in the spot. When I walked up to the car, even though the spot is reserved for Unit 100, I saw that she had a handicap sticker in her window so I didn\u2019t say anything. I am not physically disabled so it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal to me. Then I noticed that she started parking in the space more frequently but in these instances, there were no handicap signs.

The lady saw me coming in today and she was angry that I was parking in the spot. I told her that the spot was reserved for Unit 100 and she countered by saying only if I was physically disabled. I told her that she has a handicap spot to park in in front of her own building and also pointed out that she has been parking in these spaces for weeks with no visible handicap sticker or even a license plate indicating that she needs it.
