Now, Sarah was a good girl, she was the best child I could have asked for as a young single mom, so well behaved and easy to take care of. However, as she\u2019s gotten older she\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult. Now, I put this down to teenage moodiness and try not to let it affect me. A few years ago when she was 14, Sarah and I fought and it ended with me taking her phone. I went through it and found that she\u2019d been telling everyone she was \u201cnon-binary\u201d and asked her friends to call her Liz. I also found an Instagram story with her and another girl (we\u2019ll call her Kelly) saying that was her \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d I immediately confronted her about it, upset that she had lied. That semester, when Sarah failed a class for the first time ever I realised she must have been distracted and I got her to break up with Kelly. As much as I have tried to keep them apart (including taking her phone and transferring her school) Sarah will not stop being friends with Kelly even after they broke up.\n\nThis morning, Sarah comes to me and asks if she can go out on the weekend to the mall with some of her friends. This is a usual occurrence, it happens every few weeks and I think nothing of it. I go through the usual spiel of where, what time, who\u2019s going to be there. She tells me Kelly will be there. \nI immediately shut it down, and say no there is absolutely no way she\u2019s allowed to go. I told her I do not like Kelly and she needs to make other friends. She told me she has other friends, but Kelly is her friend too, and then said I\u2019m controlling and \u201cdetermined to ruin her life.\u201d \n\nTLDR, AITA for not letting my teenage daughter go out with a friend I don\u2019t like?

Two big things: the first is it literally does not matter if your kid dates women or men, or doesn't feel fully like a woman. She started exploring this at 14, a common age to delve into such topics. \"These ideas\" aren't being put into her head, she's finding out who she is in her teenage years. Jesus.

I just saw him more. I texted him from my laptop. I'm also still trans and still gay and getting ready to graduate from college soon. Her being strict didn't make me not gay or not trans or see the guy less. It's going to make your daughter want to see Kelly more, and label you as untrustworthy.

You're giving her a terrible choice - between being who she is or being without your support.

I never told my parents about my boyfriend, when we had been together for almost a year by then.", "OK so your admitting they didn't lie.  Do you honestly blame them for not telling you based on how despicably you've treated them?", "Hmm maybe they were worried that you\u2019d be an over-reactionary bigot. I wonder why they\u2019d think that?", "Teens do not have to tell their parents they have a significant other, they(your child identified as non binary) did not lie to you, they just didn\u2019t tell you for obvious reasons. \n\nWhen I was 18 I didn\u2019t tell my dad one of my friends became my boyfriend, he found out and got mad that I \u201clied\u201d since I didn\u2019t tell him and told me I was grounded from seeing him for a week(didn\u2019t end up lasting a week). \n\nGuess what, that boyfriend is now my husband. \n\nAlso you have given no actual reasons for why you don\u2019t like their girlfriend, it seems like you\u2019re just trying to control your kid who is almost an adult because the person they want to be with isn\u2019t a guy", "You are very obviously homophobic towards your daughter. Someone doesn\u2019t just make someone gay or question themselves, they just allow them to explore the parts they were already curious about and didn\u2019t have names for. You are truly terrible.", "[deleted]", "Don\u2019t even talk to mine anymore. She\u2019s done a lot, but the very last straw was her abandoning me when I needed her the most. She promised me she\u2019d help me, then she ghosted me. Coming up on three years.", "Hmmm so you never played dress up as a kid? I feel sorry for you", "They are right. Your words are problematic for exactly the reasons explained. Especially the \"claims to be NB\". You're accusing the child of exactly the same thing her parent did. Lying about their identity for attention.", "I have been told by several friends and family members that I MUST be a lesbian because I owned 2 plaid shirts growing up\u2026 being a woman who is only attracted to men doesn\u2019t matter. Plaid shirt ownership is an automatic declaration of lesbianism!!!!", "I really don't listen to my cd's anymore. Thanks for the reminder! Haven't listened to those artists in years!", "And mom will wonder why they no longer keep in contact with them", "A friend\u2018s brother moved in with his girlfriend before telling his parents and sister that he has one.", "Not how burden of proof works, bucko. You made claims, so the onus is on you to prove them.", "[deleted]", "Oh and i have always had a pixie cut and most recently bald fades. \ud83e\udd23", "No, that\u2019s Birkenstocks.", "My best friend LOVES plaid button ups, she's straight. Her step mother accused me of \"turning her gay\" despite that at the time she was dating a man, I was dating a woman and she's **loved plaid shirts since 10 years before meeting me**", "God damn it. I just bought myself and my youngest plaid shirts. Guess we\u2019re both lesbians now. And I was so invested in being straight. Her, meh. Whatever. She is who she is", "[deleted]", "You realize people can do both? And there is nothing wrong with it right? I played kick the can and rode bikes and caught frogs, but also did fashion shows for my family.", "I have a pixie cut and plaid shirts. I\u2019m also strictly dickly. \n\nOP is an AH and a bigoted one at that.", "So you\u2019re a bigot, ignorant, *and* intellectually dishonest. That\u2019s a helluva trifecta. Enjoy being lonely as your bigotry turns others away from you.", "My Walmart had men\u2019s plaid for $3! So warm and \u2728gay\u2728apparently! Such a deal!\n\nOP is definitely YTA and a bigot. Can\u2019t imagine thinking my kids\u2019 friends are \u201cinfluencing\u201d them into \u201cthose ideas.\u201d Gross to think it\u2019s like getting a Hydroflask or listening to Stray Kids"]}
