I'm at a loss. \n\nOkay, so. My (f24) boyfriend (m23) of almost 7 years lives with his mom and stepdad, and we spend a lot of time there because while I'm living at/house sitting my grandma's house in town, he doesn't like spending time there. His mom lets me cook there pretty much whenever I want, provided that I clean up whatever mess I make (which I do).\n\nAbout a week ago, I made a batch of white chicken chili for my boyfriend and I and his cousin's wife, and there was plenty left over that I put in the fridge. Three days later, I was over again around lunchtime and was peckish, so I decided to go heat up some of the chili, but when I got to the fridge, it was gone. I asked the stepdad if he knew where it was, and he said they had thrown it out because it had been there a while and wasn't good anymore. I said there was no way it had gone bad already because I've made that recipe and kept it in the fridge for much longer just fine.\n\nI texted my boyfriend and asked why my leftovers kept getting thrown away (not the first time something was gone within a few days) and he ended up talking to his mom about it and she said that she probably shouldn't have thrown it out yet but they usually just throw anything away that's been in the fridge for more than a day or two. He asked her to apologize since I was upset about the wasted money (I'm a first year teacher paying off college loans) and so she came to me and said basically \"hey sorry you're upset I threw your stuff out but we usually throw things away after two or three days\" to which I responded that I wish I'd known there was a time limit because then I'd have moved the leftovers elsewhere. She said something along the lines of \"well it's nothing to be mad about\" and left but I guess she said something to my boyfriend about me still being mad because he came down and yelled at me for being disrespectful to his mom and I shouldn't have said anything back except thanks because it's her house.\n\nI felt I wasn't disrespectful because I didn't have a tone I just calmly and matter-of-factly said I wish she'd told me that beforehand so that I could have made a different decision to not be in this situation at all. Nonetheless he's adamant that I was wildly disrespectful and should apologize to his mom for my back talk. So AITA here?\n\nEdit: formatting for readability (on mobile)\n\nETA some missing context that will hopefully help clear some things up:\n1) I have been actively encouraged by bf AND bf's mom in the past (yes, even the recent past) to cook there and treat the kitchen/house as my house as well (again, as long as I clean up after). When I cook I buy my own ingredients, with the exception of things like flour, sugar, milk, eggs, spices that are already on hand, etc. because it's ridiculous to have a separate pantry for me in their house. However I've also bought those things and more foodstuffs for their house before to repay using her stuff. (For example bf and I have been asked to run to town on occasion to get the ingredients for a meal she's making and I pay for most/all of it myself to pay back what I've used)\n\n2) I do not have \"my own\" kitchen, nor do I have the ability to get my own place now or in the near future. I live with my grandma in town and pay a modest amount of rent to her, and then after Christmas she leaves for Florida until the spring and I watch the house (I first moved in when I graduated college last December to help watch the house while she was gone). My boyfriend doesn't like to be at my grandma's house much, even when she's not there, because it's not \"his house\" and so he has to take care with someone else's things and he can't just go out to the garage and work on his truck whenever he likes, so we don't end up spending much time at grandma's house. Yes I've talked to him about this. No it hasn't really gotten anywhere. The reality is, the stuff I have to work on (papers, notebooks, a laptop, etc) is generally more portable than his stuff (trucks, heavy equipment, tools, etc) so if we both have things to get done but we want to also spend time together it makes more sense to be there. The dinner part had been frustrating me though because I'd been feeling like I was taking over the kitchen a lot lately and wanted to go to grandma's but bf assured me that it was fine and his mom didn't mind.\n\n3) As far as taking things with me when I left, over the next couple days after the chili was made, we were in and out a lot but rarely left his house to go to my house, it was usually to go to his cousin's house or some holiday party with his friends/family or, at one point, my own birthday party at my parents' house. When we were leaving to go elsewhere it didn't really make sense to try to grab the leftovers because then I'd just be carting it from someone else's kitchen to a different someone else's kitchen, and on top of that, it's not like moving the chili was at the forefront of my mind, which leads me to\n\n4) It wasn't a huge container like a full crock pot or anything, it was a medium-to-large sized stackable Tupperware container, and I made sure I stacked it underneath the other stuff they had in the fridge so it didn't get in their way of using the fridge. And yes, despite having been around for almost 7 years and using the kitchen relatively often during that time, I did not know about the hard and fast 2-3 days rule. Usually we didn't have leftovers when I cooked at his house because everyone was eating with us. It's only fairly recently that there had been a couple instances of ending up with leftovers (once I accidentally put too much cayenne pepper in the sauce I was making and so that got thrown away right after dinner because no one wanted to keep eating the too spicy sauce; another time I had a serving of pasta left that I went to find a few days later but was told it went bad which I thought was odd at the time but I let it go, but that was the catalyst for the \"why are all my leftovers getting thrown away\" comment because that was a week or so before the chili incident). The only other \"leftovers\" were the occasional takeaway boxes from eating out that I was under the impression bf dealt with if we/he didn't eat it in time.", "created_utc": 1673146187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1067mmc/aita_for_talking_back_to_my_boyfriends_mom_after/", "score": 1077, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which is reasonable really because if she's allowing her adult son to stay with her (and whether or not she should do that is a completely different question) then it's only reasonable that he can live in the house like a normal human being, cooking in the kitchen and using the fridge.\n\nYour use of the kitchen is an extension of your boyfriend's, due to your relationship. It's not like you're a friend just leaving stuff lying around when you visit. You leaving leftovers in the fridge should be no different from him leaving leftovers in the fridge, if they're from food you cooked together. (Might be slightly different if you just got yourself food when he wasn't there and left that filling their fridge, but that's not the case here).\n\nSimilarly, you leaving leftovers in the fridge should be no different from you leaving a spare coat by the front door, which would be reasonable for anyone regularly visiting their boyfriend's home (which it is, regardless of who owns it - he lives there too).\n\nBoyfriend's Mum is on the verge of being the AH by throwing away your leftovers. They're yours, food you paid for and spent time cooking, and you're a grown adult and able to make your own decisions about whether it's ok to eat or not. (If it had mould breaking out to other food, or attracting ants, then reasonable for Boyfriend's Mum to throw it out. Else not really ok.)\n\nImagine your coat by the door had a hole in it, zipper was broken. Should Boyfriend's Mum throw it out? No. She might not wear it herself in that condition but it's your coat and your choice and not ok for her just to theirs it away. Leftovers no different from coat just because they're cold. (But if your coat was covered in manure, attracting flies and unhygienic to the rest of the family then yes, ok, throw it out.)\n\nHowever, giving Boyfriend's Mum benefit of the doubt because maybe she thought a three-day leftovers rule is a social norm (which it's not, to me anyway). In which case she could have thought that you'd have done the same thing. And she seemed ok to apologise when it was brought up.\n\nYou were still ok to be annoyed at the loss of your food, unsettled that it could happen again with this strange rule, and frustrated by the waste. So \"I wish I'd known\" is a natural reaction.\n\nSo, hard to tell from a text story, but up till now, no foul.\n\nThen there was your \"I wish I'd known\" comment with whatever tone of voice you used, her interpretation of it and any guilt she might have felt at realising you were upset by it, her description of that to you boyfriend, his reading of her emotions based on her tone of voice, and his reaction back to you. Not a huge chain of communication, but easily enough for accidental misunderstanding/escalation.\n\nIt sounds as if the only really heated words were from your boyfriend to you, which potentially sets him up as the best contender for being the AH, but we don't really know enough about what she said to him to know.\n\nAside from that, everyone had been civil, no escalations or personal attacks, so this feels resolvable.\n\nIf it was me, I would work it like a shared student fridge or a shared workplace fridge:\n\no Put your leftovers in a sealed container. Ideally write what it is to give piece of mind to Boyfriend's Mum that is not something toxic.\n\no Put your name on it (or in your case just use tubs easily identifiable as yours, not hers).\n\no Put a use-by date on it, eg if you think your chicken is good for around five days, put six or seven on it to be safe.\n\no Agree with Boyfriend's Mum to that she will let you know if she sees anything unhygienic about the dates you choose (and that something going slightly mouldy in a sealed container is ok if not left for ages)\n\no Agree with Boyfriend's Mum that she'd can throw away anything past the stated date, and can leave the container somewhere for you to clean later.\n\nAnything with no name on is assumed to be Boyfriend's Mum's and she can do with what she likes, and you won't ever throw anything of theirs away (lopsided but an easy concession to give away).\n\nThen, unless you have space issues in the fridge with too many leftovers starting for too long, which is kind of a different problem, it feels as if it ought to all work smoothly.\n\nSo give a gentle apology for upsetting her, then ask her to agree some rules to help it work for you. If you can't between you come up with some rule like the above then whichever of you is being unreasonable on compromising will be the AH ;-)\n\nGood luck.

My bf told me their fridge rules/way of life after like 3 months into our relationship (when I'd started going to his house more regularly). I think it's mostly the bf's fault for not telling you, since his parents might've assumed that he'd give you the rundown of things at their house once you started going there more (as he should've). But it's also sort of on the mother as well for not telling you the rules, nor asking you about your leftovers. Especially if you're paying for most of the ingredients.\n\nAlso I don't think you were disrespecting his mother by making that statement to her about wishing you'd known so you could've moved it. She obviously took it as you being angry with her for the way you phrased it, but in the moment I don't think one would've phrased it differently either.\n\nAnyways, I think it's strange that they'd give you access to their kitchen without telling you the rules, then get angry at you when you get upset that stuff is being thrown away without your knowledge. And it's especially weird that your bf is yelling at you for disrespecting his mother over this? This situation doesn't seem serious enough to warrant yelling. And not telling you the rules for 7 years just seems really inconsiderate. Although you could've also asked. \n\nI think maybe you should just have a talk with them and apologize for the way you phrased what you said, and try to explain what you meant in a less aggressive way. Also try to come up with a compromise of some sort, or if one can't be reached, just bring the food to your grandma's house.
