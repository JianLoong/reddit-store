I'm at a loss. \n\nOkay, so. My (f24) boyfriend (m23) of almost 7 years lives with his mom and stepdad, and we spend a lot of time there because while I'm living at/house sitting my grandma's house in town, he doesn't like spending time there. His mom lets me cook there pretty much whenever I want, provided that I clean up whatever mess I make (which I do).\n\nAbout a week ago, I made a batch of white chicken chili for my boyfriend and I and his cousin's wife, and there was plenty left over that I put in the fridge. Three days later, I was over again around lunchtime and was peckish, so I decided to go heat up some of the chili, but when I got to the fridge, it was gone. I asked the stepdad if he knew where it was, and he said they had thrown it out because it had been there a while and wasn't good anymore. I said there was no way it had gone bad already because I've made that recipe and kept it in the fridge for much longer just fine.\n\nI texted my boyfriend and asked why my leftovers kept getting thrown away (not the first time something was gone within a few days) and he ended up talking to his mom about it and she said that she probably shouldn't have thrown it out yet but they usually just throw anything away that's been in the fridge for more than a day or two. He asked her to apologize since I was upset about the wasted money (I'm a first year teacher paying off college loans) and so she came to me and said basically \"hey sorry you're upset I threw your stuff out but we usually throw things away after two or three days\" to which I responded that I wish I'd known there was a time limit because then I'd have moved the leftovers elsewhere. She said something along the lines of \"well it's nothing to be mad about\" and left but I guess she said something to my boyfriend about me still being mad because he came down and yelled at me for being disrespectful to his mom and I shouldn't have said anything back except thanks because it's her house.\n\nI felt I wasn't disrespectful because I didn't have a tone I just calmly and matter-of-factly said I wish she'd told me that beforehand so that I could have made a different decision to not be in this situation at all. Nonetheless he's adamant that I was wildly disrespectful and should apologize to his mom for my back talk. So AITA here?\n\nEdit: formatting for readability (on mobile)", "created_utc": 1673146187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1067mmc/aita_for_talking_back_to_my_boyfriends_mom_after/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Apologize and start acting your age.", "**Gently, ESH**.\n\nYour boyfriend is wildly overreacting, and that makes him an AH.

From her perspective, she told you how her kitchen is run, and instead of just saying, \"Okay, thanks for letting me know,\" you kept the conversation going when she thought it was over and settled . . . and that CAN come across as antagonistic, even if you didn't mean it to.\n\nBut mostly, and I say this gently because I'm like you, and people often misunderstand my intentions negatively when I'm really just trying to clarify and I mean well . . . you're a bit of an AH for taking advantage of the situation OVERALL. These people are being kind enough to let you spend a lot of time in their home (because that's what their son wants), and even use their kitchen regularly to cook meals in. Even if you clean up after yourself, that's already an imposition on the regular. Assuming that you have a right to keep your leftovers in their fridge for days at a time on top of that is just . . . well, it's a bit entitled at worst, and at best it's just not thoughtful unless they've gone out of their way to tell you, \"Hey, feel free to leave food here, we won't touch anything that's yours.\" \n\nI don't think you're an awful person or deliberately being thoughtless.

You should not expect to just keep your food there. It\u2019s not your home. At the same time, she should know that any food they don\u2019t cook is yours, and at some point should have asked before tossing it, and told you they would be throwing it out after a specified time.

This is an issue for you due to money, my advice would be for freeze and carry instead of using the fridge there for now to side step this loophole that she seems to have about having leftovers OR labeling and dating. We have a whiteboard on our fridge that we keep a list of leftovers on and it helps. \n\nMy suggestion would be to, with your boyfriend in the loop, talk to the mom directly to clear this up.

How was she to know? All she sees it potential junk that no one\u2019s eating, taking up space.\n\nYou were wrong to be rude to her instead of just saying, \u201cok next time I\u2019ll label it\u201d or making plans with her to determine what you need to do next time to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. Passive aggressively saying \u201cwell I wish I knew there was a time limit\u201d\u2014thus putting the onus on HER to anticipate that you\u2019re cooking and need a place to leave food\u2014is rude.

He's also the mechanic (in his spare time after his regular 9-5 mechanic job) for the large machinery at his stepdad's family business, which is headquartered out of the house. So he earns his keep, just isn't in the financial situation to move out yet what with the housing market being what it is (and neither am I, college loans and a teacher's pay being what they are). Yes, being polite to his mom is definitely important given that it's her house. My point exactly is that I felt I wasn't being rude, just having a conversation as adults about the situation and indicating that had I known that was her policy I would have brought my own Tupperware to take the leftovers home in; as it stood I didn't want to take hers home, and it was a busy few days anyway where I didn't have much chance to run leftovers home.", "Well considering she's been letting me cook there and store things in the fridge for years now, I think 1) there's not much anticipation needed and 2) there's been plenty of time for the time limit to be discussed. Usually there isn't much leftover when we cook there (although it's not unusual for me to have some leftover ingredients in the fridge and those are generally left alone) but the last couple times I cooked there ended up being more of the actual meal left over than planned because of fewer people eating than I thought/eating less than I thought, hence there only recently being an issue with this + an established expectation that food I put in the fridge would stay. That's why I was upset.", "Ohhhh that\u2019s helpful context for this sort of high engagement space-sharing with in-laws\n\nHuh, It actually does sound like you are navigating the sort of daughter in law/ mother-in-law dynamics that I imagine must have arisen a lot in olden times when somebody married into the family farm with a big farmhouse and a lot of people sort of using it as a home and business \u2018base.\u2019 So the boyfriend is less the pot-head smoking in an upstairs bedroom (which is sort of what initially came to mind) and more like the family son who will overtake the family farm, out working on the tractor. Makes somewhat more sense now.\n\nYeah,i can see you\u2019re admittedly in a hard position not actually being married into the family \u2018hub\u2019 situation and still girlfriend. I too would find it hard to navigate these fridge/Tupperware conversations in an adult way if it\u2019s not really clear if you are family or guest in any given moment, since it would be hard to gauge how much you can presume or should try to reduce your footprint. I guess try to have some grace for bf\u2019s mom too since it\u2019s probably confusing for her too. Maybe sometimes she feels like warm Amish farm mom wanting her kitchen to be home for everybody, and other moments she is 21st cent person with Clorox wipes straightening up the kitchen and not sure why her fridge is full of other people\u2019s food.

I only cook in her kitchen if it's for me and bf, never just myself, (and I always offer mom and stepdad some as well,) even though bf has told me multiple times that his mom does not mind if I use the kitchen (and she has also told me that herself, she felt bad that I am not allowed to use my own mom's kitchen without permission/supervision because my mom is really particular about her stuff and told me that I could use her kitchen whenever and treat it like mine as long as I cleaned up so I could learn to cook & become more confident/proficient in the kitchen).

At times, I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019m trying to be generous with my space and my life, and in return I\u2019m being told that I shouldn\u2019t live the way I want to live. I should live according to other people\u2019s preferences, even though I\u2019m the one who worked my ass off to be able to afford the house big enough for everyone.\n\nI\u2019ve also been where you are in terms of small salary, student loans, and an expensive city and had to pay rent on top of all of that, so I understand how frustrating it is when food unnecessarily goes to waste. But look at it this way, $10-20 of wasted food is way less than the cost of rent. It\u2019s not worth upsetting the person who is providing your boyfriend (and to an extent you) with free housing because they did something that cost you a few bucks.", "I read OPs comments and how often she\u2019s there is the clear indication. They also allow her to use their kitchen as there own, so it makes sense to at least ask her, otherwise what was the pint of opening up their kitchen to her that way. \n\nJust because she has the right doesn\u2019t mean she should. It was an innocent comment and she blew it out of proportion. OP simply stated that she didn\u2019t know. Get over it and stop being so dramatic.", "Due to food safety, I do the same thing as your boyfriends mom. 2-3 days it goes in the trash. I can't keep track of what dish is good for how long.  I don't do it out of malice, I do it because food poisoning sucks and I have limited fridge space. I can't think of anyone I know that doesn't do the same. Even most jobs I have had throw out leftovers over a couple days old.

Tell him there needs to be a compromise. \n\nAlso, for me if someone leaves 1-2 portion of food, I\u2019m kinda fine with it. But leaving a big batch is an added chore for me. It takes up space, cleaning the container is more than cleaning out a small batch, etc. So if I were you I\u2019d bring containers to bring it home and ask them if you should leave any.

Unless he has an unmanageable allergy to something at your grandma's house, I'm unable to think of another rational excuse for never coming there. It's time for another conversation to reevaluate where you guys spend your time - hopefully a little more evenly between your homes."]}
