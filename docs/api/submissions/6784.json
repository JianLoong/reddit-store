I'm at a loss. \n\nOkay, so. My (f24) boyfriend (m23) of almost 7 years lives with his mom and stepdad, and we spend a lot of time there because while I'm living at/house sitting my grandma's house in town, he doesn't like spending time there. His mom lets me cook there pretty much whenever I want, provided that I clean up whatever mess I make (which I do).\n\nAbout a week ago, I made a batch of white chicken chili for my boyfriend and I and his cousin's wife, and there was plenty left over that I put in the fridge. Three days later, I was over again around lunchtime and was peckish, so I decided to go heat up some of the chili, but when I got to the fridge, it was gone. I asked the stepdad if he knew where it was, and he said they had thrown it out because it had been there a while and wasn't good anymore. I said there was no way it had gone bad already because I've made that recipe and kept it in the fridge for much longer just fine.\n\nI texted my boyfriend and asked why my leftovers kept getting thrown away (not the first time something was gone within a few days) and he ended up talking to his mom about it and she said that she probably shouldn't have thrown it out yet but they usually just throw anything away that's been in the fridge for more than a day or two. He asked her to apologize since I was upset about the wasted money (I'm a first year teacher paying off college loans) and so she came to me and said basically \"hey sorry you're upset I threw your stuff out but we usually throw things away after two or three days\" to which I responded that I wish I'd known there was a time limit because then I'd have moved the leftovers elsewhere. She said something along the lines of \"well it's nothing to be mad about\" and left but I guess she said something to my boyfriend about me still being mad because he came down and yelled at me for being disrespectful to his mom and I shouldn't have said anything back except thanks because it's her house.\n\nI felt I wasn't disrespectful because I didn't have a tone I just calmly and matter-of-factly said I wish she'd told me that beforehand so that I could have made a different decision to not be in this situation at all. Nonetheless he's adamant that I was wildly disrespectful and should apologize to his mom for my back talk. So AITA here?\n\nEdit: formatting for readability (on mobile)", "created_utc": 1673146187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1067mmc/aita_for_talking_back_to_my_boyfriends_mom_after/", "score": 343, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Apologize and start acting your age.", "**Gently, ESH**.\n\nYour boyfriend is wildly overreacting, and that makes him an AH. But it's also fair to say that people don't always communicate well, and his mother may have perceived the fact that you responded AT ALL again once she explained to you that they normally don't keep leftovers long, as you trying to persist in antagonising her, even if that wasn't your intention.  From her perspective, she told you how her kitchen is run, and instead of just saying, \"Okay, thanks for letting me know,\" you kept the conversation going when she thought it was over and settled . . . and that CAN come across as antagonistic, even if you didn't mean it to.\n\nBut mostly, and I say this gently because I'm like you, and people often misunderstand my intentions negatively when I'm really just trying to clarify and I mean well . . . you're a bit of an AH for taking advantage of the situation OVERALL. These people are being kind enough to let you spend a lot of time in their home (because that's what their son wants), and even use their kitchen regularly to cook meals in. Even if you clean up after yourself, that's already an imposition on the regular. Assuming that you have a right to keep your leftovers in their fridge for days at a time on top of that is just . . . well, it's a bit entitled at worst, and at best it's just not thoughtful unless they've gone out of their way to tell you, \"Hey, feel free to leave food here, we won't touch anything that's yours.\" \n\nI don't think you're an awful person or deliberately being thoughtless.

You should not expect to just keep your food there. It\u2019s not your home. At the same time, she should know that any food they don\u2019t cook is yours, and at some point should have asked before tossing it, and told you they would be throwing it out after a specified time. And your BF should be able to communicate without yelling at her. To me it seems the BF and mother both have a passive aggressive communication style which doesn\u2019t mesh well with her more direct communication style.", "NTA - I know people can be weird about food and saying good versus bad but she\u2019s just being flippant it seems. This is an issue for you due to money, my advice would be for freeze and carry instead of using the fridge there for now to side step this loophole that she seems to have about having leftovers OR labeling and dating. We have a whiteboard on our fridge that we keep a list of leftovers on and it helps. \n\nMy suggestion would be to, with your boyfriend in the loop, talk to the mom directly to clear this up.

My point exactly is that I felt I wasn't being rude, just having a conversation as adults about the situation and indicating that had I known that was her policy I would have brought my own Tupperware to take the leftovers home in; as it stood I didn't want to take hers home, and it was a busy few days anyway where I didn't have much chance to run leftovers home.", "Well considering she's been letting me cook there and store things in the fridge for years now, I think 1) there's not much anticipation needed and 2) there's been plenty of time for the time limit to be discussed.

Even most jobs I have had throw out leftovers over a couple days old.

Which is reasonable really because if she's allowing her adult son to stay with her (and whether or not she should do that is a completely different question) then it's only reasonable that he can live in the house like a normal human being, cooking in the kitchen and using the fridge.\n\nYour use of the kitchen is an extension of your boyfriend's, due to your relationship. It's not like you're a friend just leaving stuff lying around when you visit. You leaving leftovers in the fridge should be no different from him leaving leftovers in the fridge, if they're from food you cooked together. (Might be slightly different if you just got yourself food when he wasn't there and left that filling their fridge, but that's not the case here).\n\nSimilarly, you leaving leftovers in the fridge should be no different from you leaving a spare coat by the front door, which would be reasonable for anyone regularly visiting their boyfriend's home (which it is, regardless of who owns it - he lives there too).\n\nBoyfriend's Mum is on the verge of being the AH by throwing away your leftovers. They're yours, food you paid for and spent time cooking, and you're a grown adult and able to make your own decisions about whether it's ok to eat or not. (If it had mould breaking out to other food, or attracting ants, then reasonable for Boyfriend's Mum to throw it out. Else not really ok.)\n\nImagine your coat by the door had a hole in it, zipper was broken. Should Boyfriend's Mum throw it out? No. She might not wear it herself in that condition but it's your coat and your choice and not ok for her just to theirs it away. Leftovers no different from coat just because they're cold. (But if your coat was covered in manure, attracting flies and unhygienic to the rest of the family then yes, ok, throw it out.)\n\nHowever, giving Boyfriend's Mum benefit of the doubt because maybe she thought a three-day leftovers rule is a social norm (which it's not, to me anyway). In which case she could have thought that you'd have done the same thing. And she seemed ok to apologise when it was brought up.\n\nYou were still ok to be annoyed at the loss of your food, unsettled that it could happen again with this strange rule, and frustrated by the waste. So \"I wish I'd known\" is a natural reaction.\n\nSo, hard to tell from a text story, but up till now, no foul.\n\nThen there was your \"I wish I'd known\" comment with whatever tone of voice you used, her interpretation of it and any guilt she might have felt at realising you were upset by it, her description of that to you boyfriend, his reading of her emotions based on her tone of voice, and his reaction back to you. Not a huge chain of communication, but easily enough for accidental misunderstanding/escalation.\n\nIt sounds as if the only really heated words were from your boyfriend to you, which potentially sets him up as the best contender for being the AH, but we don't really know enough about what she said to him to know.\n\nAside from that, everyone had been civil, no escalations or personal attacks, so this feels resolvable.\n\nIf it was me, I would work it like a shared student fridge or a shared workplace fridge:\n\no Put your leftovers in a sealed container. Ideally write what it is to give piece of mind to Boyfriend's Mum that is not something toxic.\n\no Put your name on it (or in your case just use tubs easily identifiable as yours, not hers).\n\no Put a use-by date on it, eg if you think your chicken is good for around five days, put six or seven on it to be safe.\n\no Agree with Boyfriend's Mum to that she will let you know if she sees anything unhygienic about the dates you choose (and that something going slightly mouldy in a sealed container is ok if not left for ages)\n\no Agree with Boyfriend's Mum that she'd can throw away anything past the stated date, and can leave the container somewhere for you to clean later.\n\nAnything with no name on is assumed to be Boyfriend's Mum's and she can do with what she likes, and you won't ever throw anything of theirs away (lopsided but an easy concession to give away).\n\nThen, unless you have space issues in the fridge with too many leftovers starting for too long, which is kind of a different problem, it feels as if it ought to all work smoothly.\n\nSo give a gentle apology for upsetting her, then ask her to agree some rules to help it work for you. If you can't between you come up with some rule like the above then whichever of you is being unreasonable on compromising will be the AH ;-)\n\nGood luck.
