I'd advice to talk to your parents and share your concerns. Their words would weigh something. Try to do everything in writing, so you'd have proofs you tried to resolve the matter constantly.

C'est une dictatrice. On lui donne beaucoup de pouvoir et elle adore \u00e7a. Le travail d'un enseignant consiste \u00e0 enseigner, c'est pourquoi on l'appelle enseignant.", "NTA. I agree with the earlier comment, find out how the system works first before coming to the board. She\u2019s power tripping because she knows she did wrong and it hurt her ego that a student pointed it out to her.  You should also find as many students who think the same as you. A collective complaint is more powerful than one.

They can help advocate for you.", "NTA time to get the other students on board with you", "Fuck her indeed. NTA.", "NTA but as a school board member, please use the chain of command. The school board is also responsible for policy work, not procedural work and staff changes. First take it up with your principal and if that doesn\u2019t work, go to the superintendent. School board really can\u2019t do anything but report it to the superintendent anyway.", ">Ever since French I, my instructor has been refusing to adequately teach us but expects us to know everything through studying by ourselves outside of class in a foreign language class.\n\nINFO: What are you doing during class time?\n\n\u201cTeaching yourself everything outside of class time\u201d is called studying. Your teacher may be using a [flipped classroom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) approach to teaching. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to say from the information given  if the teacher is genuinely a bad teacher or if OP is a kid whining about not being spoon fed all the test answers so that they can get their A with minimal effort.", "NTA always report teachers the moment they cross a line. They're there to guide, teach, and protect, fairly. I've dealt with a few teachers who did none of those things and only good has come of it.\n\nAlso going back and lowering your grades as retaliation is WAYYYYYYYYYYYY over the line. Her personal feelings are affecting her objectivity in grading. That's against policy.", "You're so NTA. I advise you to ask other students in your class to testify to give more weight to your words.\nIf you need help, you can ask me, I am French and I will help you with pleasure!", "NTA, she should be teaching you. But get evidence first.", "NTA honey that's what the board is there for. You give them your information, they decide.  All you're doing is telling the truth to the appropriate people.  I would also inform the head teacher of your report if they seem friendly (if not have your parent or guardian do it) so that they are not blindsided by this.", "NTA She\u2019s not fit to teach. Go to your parents and help them bring it to the school board. If they fail to do anything, have your parents blast the school on social media. Contact news stations if the story gets juicy through retaliation.", "Keep a record of what happens and be respectful, but you\u2019ll get much farther with this if an adult fights this battle. \n\nEven if she is being horrid, keep it respectful. Then she won\u2019t have a justification.", "Nta. You said she lowered your old grades, do you have any proof of what your grades used to be? If so make sure that you bring that to prove that she changed your grades after the fact.  Also, you should try to get as many students as possible in your class to also report her.  If it\u2019s just you reporting her, it could just look like one disgruntled student.  If all of the students report on her not teaching, there will be more of a chance of them looking into it.  Also, any kind of evidence that you can get that helps prove what you are saying will help.  Good luck.", "NTA. I would mark down every incident that happens in class with dates and times so you are prepared when you get questioned. You are likely not the first person to complain about her.", "NTA. If you can remember the dates things happened and write those down, it will help the principal understand the extent of the problem.", "NTA - Go to the head of the language department. Ask them to review your teacher's lesson plans. How do the other students do? What level of mastery have they achieved? There are many different ways to teach a class, and there is something called the flipped classroom where you study at home and test in class. But there needs to be a plan, and not just some handwaving\n\nAlso, if there are question about your personal life that you don't want to answer, just make stuff up. \"Mon peres, Jacques et Henri avait commence baiser Pierre, le gar\u00e7on de piscine\" OK, French classes are nothing but a faint memory now. But you should get graded on your French language skills, not on your family tree", "No not at all", "Nerd", "Sounds like a really badly thought out teaching hook.  She should have made up fake characters, like 'Tom and Julie are married, Emma and Evalyn are engaged, Frances and Steph are divorced'.", "Sorry, I don't speak Italian", "Where do you live?", "Only my mom is in my life and she thinks her grading is ridiculous. She said she\u2019s going to come with me tomorrow for a meeting with the principal.", "It\u2019s a private Christian school. OP faces up hill battle.", "If she\u2019s retroactively lowering grades, she\u2019s a bad teacher. Even if we assume that OP isn\u2019t doing what they should be doing, that sort of retaliation is completely unacceptable.", "She gets distracted for most of class and does nothing but play on her guitar while singing. We spend more than half the class time talking about the Bible (my school is a private Christian school) and if we don\u2019t do that she\u2019s singing some song while playing her guitar. If she\u2019s in the mood, she\u2019ll have us read our textbook by ourselves in class. So no, I am not just a kid who whines about not being spoon fed all the test answers.", "...do you think assigning students detention for not telling her their parents' marital status makes her a good teacher?", "I'm gonna wish you both good luck with this. Hopefully the principal will not cover for the teacher, and acknowledge changes need to be made. If he is combative and will not back down, please do not be afraid to go higher up in the chain to right this.", "Don't be afraid to throw around going to the school board about this if they don't listen. Because they probably won't. This is straight-up bullying and probably illegal behavior, depending on where you live.", "I would ask for written agreement as a result of this meeting. Or, if your principal decline written statement, send him/her follow-up email with step-by-step solution plan you agreed with, so you'd have your record if have to go further to the board.", "Are they French songs? Are you learning songs in French?\n\nI was about to write ESH because the complaint \u201cteacher refuses to teach\u201d is a pretty common one from students when they aren\u2019t actually doing the hard parts of the work.  You\u2019re not going to get very far with that complaint.\n\nPublic school teachers, and many private school teachers are required to have a daily agenda and learning objectives.  It\u2019s possible this is not required at your Christian private school because of Jesus, but if it IS required, that\u2019s a valid complaint.", "Get video proof each time it happens. Gather your evidence first before you go to the board", "I imagine it was a task to learn how to say words like single, married, divorced, widowed, etc in French which seems like an appropriate task for French 2 and refusal to participate in a classroom activity could be ground for detention. Just make something up if you don't wanna say their real status so that you can particiapte/learn", "Yes they\u2019re French worship songs but the songs have absolutely nothing to do with what we are doing in class.", "Yeah, that's bullshit. It's not up to students to lie because teachers can't come up with appropriate assignments.", "Okay so your complaints might go nowhere I\u2019m afraid. Since it\u2019s a Christian school? It\u2019s possible that the admins care way more that you learn to worship Jesus in French than if you actually learn to speak French.\n\nEven if they weren\u2019t Jesus songs, learning to sing foreign language songs is typically part of any language curriculum anyway\u2026. Learning about the arts and culture of those regions is important."]}
