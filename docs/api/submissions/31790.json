She said I was disrespectful and reported me for \u201cbullying and harassment\u201d against her. Additionally, she retaliated by lowering my old grades, give out more assignments/assessments (we have quizzes/tests every class and she never prepares us for them), and reported me for \u201cbullying and harassment\u201d towards her. She\u2019s also forced all of her students to publicly announce their parent\u2019s  marital status and assigned detentions to students for refusing to announce their parents marital status. She assigned me a Saturday detention for questioning her teaching capabilities. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and have decided to report her to the board.

I'd advice to talk to your parents and share your concerns. Their words would weigh something. Try to do everything in writing, so you'd have proofs you tried to resolve the matter constantly.

C'est une dictatrice. On lui donne beaucoup de pouvoir et elle adore \u00e7a. Le travail d'un enseignant consiste \u00e0 enseigner, c'est pourquoi on l'appelle enseignant.", "NTA. I agree with the earlier comment, find out how the system works first before coming to the board. She\u2019s power tripping because she knows she did wrong and it hurt her ego that a student pointed it out to her.  You should also find as many students who think the same as you. A collective complaint is more powerful than one. You can also try bringing parents to complain if possible for demanding to know their marital statuses.", "NTA\n\nYOU NEED AN ADULT ON YOUR SIDE THAT CAN ADVOCATE FOR YOU. It doesn't have to be your bio parents, but it must NOT be someone connected with the school.\n\nIf she has been retroactively changing your grades, there WILL be proof, unless she knows someone capable of hacking the actual school system pc network. If she did it on paper, there will also be evidence, either erasures or whiteout or crossouts. \n\nYou need an advocate familiar with the ins and outs of the network, possibly even an attorney.\n\nWhat are your parents actually saying about all of this?", "NTA \nI don\u2019t know where you are, but it is a matter of the system you are in.  If she lowered your grades then there is a lot more power given to her than in many countries.  \nBe sure to find out and understand how the school works for or against students in this regard, then weigh your options.", "NTA\nIf your parents are on your side I would have them report it too. I had a similar issue in high school biology where the teacher wouldn\u2019t teach us but just gave us copy notes and not teach us at all so I had my mom go to switch me to a new class", "Talk this with other students. Report her to authorities and if they ignore you then shout you'll take the legal action. other students are also suffering so you can say they all are gonna side with you.", "NTA\nYour teacher sounds incredibly petty and immature.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
