This year the new coach is making seniors \u201cdo their part.\u201d It takes SO long and since I drive my guy home every day we aren\u2019t getting home until almost 6. I have to ride his A anyways to get him to study so he doesn\u2019t mess up his eligibility and this is harder.\n\nOn Friday I approached the coach and told him that I didn\u2019t think my guy should have to clean the field anymore since he\u2019s so good of a player and he\u2019s a senior. He said he would take it into consideration. Well I guess at Saturday practice he told the team what happened and everyone was teasing him that I\u2019m treating him like a baby and the coach made him run extra to get the \u201cbut out of his ass\u201d and let him realize they are a team.  My guy avoided me all weekend.\n\nThen today ALL of my friends said I was a major Asshole and I\u2019m not his mommy and need to back off. \n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1675115183, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pf2qx/aita_for_advocating_for_my_guy_to_his_baseball/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You basically did this without your bf's input\n2. The coach is basically instilling in the team a good practice of cleaning up after yourself and you're trying to hamper that effort\n3. You believe your bf is owed special treatment because he is better than everyone else.\n4. As with most people here who are TA you don't make an actual case as to why you're not TA.

You\u2019re \u201cbasically\u201d engaged? I hope he dumps you after this. You\u2019re a control freak and you embarrassed the hell out of him by doing what you did behind his back. The coach was instilling values including that no one is better than anyone else. They might be better players but that doesn\u2019t mean they should not have to do regular chores like anyone else. You sound insufferable to be honest. Get a life of your own", "YTA. You cannot interfere with a relationship between a coach and a player like that.

Basically, what I got from your story is that you think your guy SPECIFICALLY shouldn't have to clean the field because he's... so good at baseball? I don't see the correlation between the two, nor do I see why he gets privileges for being good, it would just cause a rift in the team. Also, you were \"sticking up\" for him even though he never told you there was a problem nor did he hint at one in the first place.\n\nEdit: words", "My guy is how old??  High School Or College?", "Lol yes. YTA. The team wins because they work together as a TEAM. Without the team your guy wouldn\u2019t be anywhere.

Why would you be so intentionally vague? I shouldn't have to read down to find out your relationship when boyfriend would have sufficed. Keep your pet nicknames to yourself as it's not cute, but rather nauseating. \n\nBaseball is a team game and no single player is responsible for the team's success. Even if he's the best player in the country, he still needs 8 other guys to hit, field, and pitch. You seem to be ill-versed on how team sports operate. \n\nThe new coach is free to determine what are appropriate team-building exercises. I played a ton of sports in my younger days and as I've gotten older, I've seen how self-defeating it is to treat seniors or upperclassmen apart from the rest of the team. It's much more effective to reinforce that they're all teammates and in this together. You win together and you lose together. \n\nWho the hell are you to make the determinations of what the coach's players should be doing? And how exactly do you think that would play out in the locker room when the coach shows blatant favoritism to one player? \n\nYou embarrassed your bf with your childish and ill-informed antics. Even worse, you completely didn't consider the message you sent on your unwitting boyfriend's behalf. You made him seem like a whiny prima donna expecting special treatment. That's a good way for a player to end up in a coach's doghouse and get benched to send a message (even a good player).

It\u2019s not impossible, but you aren\u2019t setting yourself up for success.\n\nA couple thoughts:\n1. This was not your place. Over the next several years, there will be a lot of things regarding baseball that will not be your place to interfere. You need to learn that or you will definitely sabotage your relationship. What ever level your \u201cguy\u201d ends up at, he will no longer be the top dog. There\u2019s going to be a lot of things that you interpret as unfair. Keep your mouth shut.\n2. College baseball is basically a full time job. On top of practice, he will likely have mandatory study hall with the team. This is almost universally required of freshman. You will not see much of him. You better be able to cope with that. It will test your relationship and give you lots of challenges.\n3. There will be a lot of girls trying to get his attention in college or at the minor league level. We know several young men in the minors. It\u2019s grueling and there are lots of off field distractions. Be prepared for how hard this will be.\n\nYour post comes across as very controlling.

After this little fiasco, I'm sure he's going to be re-evaluating this whole relationship with you.", "Does he know this?", "Yea we've all been there before. Let's just say there's a reason this comment keeps getting down voted, and you should use that fact to reflect on yourself. You're still a child. The next 5 years of your life will include A LOT of growth and maturation for both of you, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you may grow in different ways and not be right for each other anymore.

Why are you confused about this?", "It is, though and you\u2019re delusional and in denial.", "It is \ud83d\udcaf true. I am a baseball and softball coach for travel teams and deal with this.

They look HARD for these things now.\n\nSchools do a LOT more research these days on players, and they have ALWAYS spoken to coaches about the players' character, life outside the sport and any \"distractions\" they need to be aware of.\n\nYou just fell into the \"distraction\" category and will most likely find yourself given the cold shoulder from now on by coaching staff.", "Tell us it\u2019s not true one more time and we might believe you", "If you can't tell someone how something isn't true, then be quiet.

You're an annoying, clingy, know it all, who thinks her guy needs to be with her 24/7. It's time to grow up.

Dude will dump you when he is exposed to less..  obstinate personalities in college.  You will lose him. You sound entitled and super immature.

Your choice", "But did *your guy* say he had a problem with the raking and needed some help sorting it?", "Does your guy use the field? Yes?

No. If he\u2019s as good as you say he is, there will be women all over him all the time. The likelihood of you fulfilling your fantasy as a pro baseball wife is just about zero.

That account is 19 hours old I wonder if it's OPs attempt to turn minds.", "No where", "There is none.", "If the only reason people are making fun of him is because a girl spoke on his behalf that's sexist.

The coach is not wrong.", "Why do you think he is a great guy?", "Yeah, this is definitely a high school senior. He's way too young to be dealing with this level of clingy and controlling.", "Reading between the lines here, they're both like 17. So just the best thing so far.", "We talked today but what are you implying", "My parents and his parents all started dating in middle school and are so happy. It\u2019s what we want to.", "They were saying I answered a question wrong", "Psssht he don\u2019t need to be recruited he may just go pro", "What in the Sweet Valley High", "I mean not necessarily.

That's the entire point of sports. It doesn't matter if his mom, dad, sister, brother, male or female cousin, nb friend, gender fluid acquaintance did this.

Poor kid.", "He didn\u2019t talk to you all weekend!\n\nObviously even he thinks YTA", "Honey, that's not always healthy.
