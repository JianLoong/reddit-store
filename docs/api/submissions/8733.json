The team do this stuff together is what builds the team. There is nothing more.a coach hates than an outsider telling them how to run things.

You cannot interfere with a relationship between a coach and a player like that.

Basically, what I got from your story is that you think your guy SPECIFICALLY shouldn't have to clean the field because he's... so good at baseball? I don't see the correlation between the two, nor do I see why he gets privileges for being good, it would just cause a rift in the team. Also, you were \"sticking up\" for him even though he never told you there was a problem nor did he hint at one in the first place.\n\nEdit: words", "My guy is how old??  High School Or College?", "Lol yes. YTA. The team wins because they work together as a TEAM. Without the team your guy wouldn\u2019t be anywhere.

Why would you be so intentionally vague? I shouldn't have to read down to find out your relationship when boyfriend would have sufficed. Keep your pet nicknames to yourself as it's not cute, but rather nauseating. \n\nBaseball is a team game and no single player is responsible for the team's success. Even if he's the best player in the country, he still needs 8 other guys to hit, field, and pitch. You seem to be ill-versed on how team sports operate. \n\nThe new coach is free to determine what are appropriate team-building exercises. I played a ton of sports in my younger days and as I've gotten older, I've seen how self-defeating it is to treat seniors or upperclassmen apart from the rest of the team. It's much more effective to reinforce that they're all teammates and in this together. You win together and you lose together. \n\nWho the hell are you to make the determinations of what the coach's players should be doing? And how exactly do you think that would play out in the locker room when the coach shows blatant favoritism to one player? \n\nYou embarrassed your bf with your childish and ill-informed antics. Even worse, you completely didn't consider the message you sent on your unwitting boyfriend's behalf. You made him seem like a whiny prima donna expecting special treatment. That's a good way for a player to end up in a coach's doghouse and get benched to send a message (even a good player).

It\u2019s not impossible, but you aren\u2019t setting yourself up for success.\n\nA couple thoughts:\n1. This was not your place. Over the next several years, there will be a lot of things regarding baseball that will not be your place to interfere. You need to learn that or you will definitely sabotage your relationship. What ever level your \u201cguy\u201d ends up at, he will no longer be the top dog. There\u2019s going to be a lot of things that you interpret as unfair. Keep your mouth shut.\n2. College baseball is basically a full time job. On top of practice, he will likely have mandatory study hall with the team. This is almost universally required of freshman. You will not see much of him. You better be able to cope with that. It will test your relationship and give you lots of challenges.\n3. There will be a lot of girls trying to get his attention in college or at the minor league level. We know several young men in the minors.

Not for nothing, but being the best player on a state quarter finalist team is not the flex you think it is. There are 50 states (not even counting PR, which is heavily scouted) and 8 teams in a quarterfinal round, so at least 400 kids each year can make that claim, and they all also want to get recruited both for college and the MLB. Unless he's been named a top 100 recruit, he's not likely to go pro soon. And, should he make it to the MLB, most players spend at least a few years in the minors, in which case you'd really never see him because he'd be perpetually on the road for 8 months of the year. Bottom line, do not put all your eggs in this kid's basket.\n\nPLEASE try to get some perspective; a future that revolves around someone else's success is extremely limiting.

Is that because you don\u2019t think your relationship will survive, or because you don\u2019t want to spend too much time without him?\n\nBeing in an adult relationship means knowing there are going to be challenges, but you\u2019re going to figure out how to deal with them together. That might mean spending less time together for a while, or even doing temporary long-distance\u2014but if you want to both be happy and together, it is worth it. And you\u2019ll be able to work together to figure out the details and make sure you stay connected.\n\nBecause if you don\u2019t, and you ask each other to give up really good opportunities, you will probably start to resent each other. \n\nYou\u2019re in a relationship, but you\u2019re still two people. Two people with so many amazing things ahead of you. And the only thing that would be worse than breaking up is staying together and both being resentful, sad, miserable and lonely anyway.\n\nA healthy relationship means knowing you\u2019re both actively choosing to be together because you want to make each other happy, and not just staying together because you\u2019re afraid of what things would look like without each other.\n\nGood luck!", "Just because he\u2019s the best on the team doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s exempt from certain team functions. If he doesn\u2019t stay to rake, he would not be acting like a team player. Guys that think they\u2019re too good to do things other than play don\u2019t make it too far because people don\u2019t want to work with them.", "Look back down in a crowded hall you'll see my guy standing...", "Yeah, I was going to tell OP thank you for being a perfect teachable moment to all these seniors... And yes, that kid is going to be teased for that. Hopefully he'll learn how to deal with that too.", "For both of their sakes I sure hope they don't stay together long term lmao.", "Is he really everywhere or a reflection?", "Have you ever thought maybe, you and your obsessiveness is the reason he is pissy and moody??", "Lol. Cringe. YTA", "They won't.  There's no way this guy will meet other people and do other things, and stay around for this.  And possibly visa versa- when *everyone* on the college team was the cream of the crop on their HS team, and this guy is a lowly freshman again, she might decide to move on too.", "I can see Jessica paying someone to dress up as her boyfriend to do it for him", "You can say killed lol. It's reddit not tiktok.", "When I read that I went, \u201cyikes.\u201d", "She is planning to \u201cgo where he goes, and play it by ear.\u201d Basically she hasn\u2019t even thought about her OWN life and goals. She is going to lose him if she doesn\u2019t loosen her grip.", "Only if he chooses where she wants him to go. She is wanting to talk him out of naval school and trying to get teachers on board with her thought just because she won\u2019t see him if he goes!", "Dress up as her guy you mean", "I was considering both options to be honest.", "And the military wouldn\u2019t put up with your interfering nonsense for a nanosecond. God forbid they install a spine in \u201cyour guy\u201d, however would you cope??", "Girl, please let him be his own person. You will not keep him by controlling him like that. He told you what he wants to do. But you aren\u2019t listening bc it\u2019s not the vision *you* had. It\u2019s kind of gross to hear that you are manipulating him, and plan on getting others to manipulate him, to do what you want. He will not stay your \u201cguy\u201d very long if you keep it up. \nStop interfering in his personal business. Stop acting like a parent over him. Stop smothering him!! \nTake a step back and really think about this. \nIf he actually forgives you for this and you guys are fine. Please take my advice here, and worry about YOURSELF. Not him. Think about what you want to do in life. Think about how to make yourself happy in case things don\u2019t work out after HS. Bc a lot of relationships don\u2019t make it once college starts. Don\u2019t follow him like a crazy person. You\u2019ll just push him further away and he will resent you.\nEdit: grammar", "Wow! So this is one of the stories of the girls who attach themselves like a parasite to some young boy with athletic talent hoping she can ride him all the way to a mansion. I expect in 2 years, he'll be in college and you'll have \"accidentally\" gotten pregnant and tell him to go pro so you can sit on your ass living off his skills. YTA!", "That football movie with the Dawson in it. The GF of the first string QB sees him get his leg broken and starts going after him so she can screw her way out of the town. \n\nThat is OP"]}
