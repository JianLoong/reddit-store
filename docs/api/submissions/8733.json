This year the new coach is making seniors \u201cdo their part.\u201d It takes SO long and since I drive my guy home every day we aren\u2019t getting home until almost 6. I have to ride his A anyways to get him to study so he doesn\u2019t mess up his eligibility and this is harder.\n\nOn Friday I approached the coach and told him that I didn\u2019t think my guy should have to clean the field anymore since he\u2019s so good of a player and he\u2019s a senior. He said he would take it into consideration. Well I guess at Saturday practice he told the team what happened and everyone was teasing him that I\u2019m treating him like a baby and the coach made him run extra to get the \u201cbut out of his ass\u201d and let him realize they are a team.  My guy avoided me all weekend.\n\nThen today ALL of my friends said I was a major Asshole and I\u2019m not his mommy and need to back off. \n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1675115183, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pf2qx/aita_for_advocating_for_my_guy_to_his_baseball/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You basically did this without your bf's input\n2. The coach is basically instilling in the team a good practice of cleaning up after yourself and you're trying to hamper that effort\n3. You believe your bf is owed special treatment because he is better than everyone else.\n4. As with most people here who are TA you don't make an actual case as to why you're not TA.

You\u2019re \u201cbasically\u201d engaged? I hope he dumps you after this. You\u2019re a control freak and you embarrassed the hell out of him by doing what you did behind his back. The coach was instilling values including that no one is better than anyone else. They might be better players but that doesn\u2019t mean they should not have to do regular chores like anyone else. You sound insufferable to be honest. Get a life of your own", "YTA. You cannot interfere with a relationship between a coach and a player like that.

Basically, what I got from your story is that you think your guy SPECIFICALLY shouldn't have to clean the field because he's... so good at baseball? I don't see the correlation between the two, nor do I see why he gets privileges for being good, it would just cause a rift in the team. Also, you were \"sticking up\" for him even though he never told you there was a problem nor did he hint at one in the first place.\n\nEdit: words", "My guy is how old??  High School Or College?", "Lol yes. YTA. The team wins because they work together as a TEAM. Without the team your guy wouldn\u2019t be anywhere.

Why would you be so intentionally vague? I shouldn't have to read down to find out your relationship when boyfriend would have sufficed. Keep your pet nicknames to yourself as it's not cute, but rather nauseating. \n\nBaseball is a team game and no single player is responsible for the team's success. Even if he's the best player in the country, he still needs 8 other guys to hit, field, and pitch. You seem to be ill-versed on how team sports operate. \n\nThe new coach is free to determine what are appropriate team-building exercises. I played a ton of sports in my younger days and as I've gotten older, I've seen how self-defeating it is to treat seniors or upperclassmen apart from the rest of the team. It's much more effective to reinforce that they're all teammates and in this together. You win together and you lose together. \n\nWho the hell are you to make the determinations of what the coach's players should be doing? And how exactly do you think that would play out in the locker room when the coach shows blatant favoritism to one player? \n\nYou embarrassed your bf with your childish and ill-informed antics. Even worse, you completely didn't consider the message you sent on your unwitting boyfriend's behalf. You made him seem like a whiny prima donna expecting special treatment. That's a good way for a player to end up in a coach's doghouse and get benched to send a message (even a good player).

It\u2019s not impossible, but you aren\u2019t setting yourself up for success.\n\nA couple thoughts:\n1. This was not your place. Over the next several years, there will be a lot of things regarding baseball that will not be your place to interfere. You need to learn that or you will definitely sabotage your relationship. What ever level your \u201cguy\u201d ends up at, he will no longer be the top dog. There\u2019s going to be a lot of things that you interpret as unfair. Keep your mouth shut.\n2. College baseball is basically a full time job. On top of practice, he will likely have mandatory study hall with the team. This is almost universally required of freshman. You will not see much of him. You better be able to cope with that. It will test your relationship and give you lots of challenges.\n3. There will be a lot of girls trying to get his attention in college or at the minor league level. We know several young men in the minors. It\u2019s grueling and there are lots of off field distractions. Be prepared for how hard this will be.\n\nYour post comes across as very controlling.

You are not looking like someone who can handle the pressures of MLB.", "A helicopter mom, at that.", "And u decided to embarass him?\nWow..", "Not for long \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Do you hear yourself? You are one of the most selfish people I have ever heard.", "If they\u2019re spending a lot of time on this then they\u2019re doing it wrong. Raking the field takes 15 minutes, if that. If they\u2019re being made to rechalk as well then that\u2019s another 5. It\u2019s not much.", "girl\u2026", "Are you gonna approach his professors in college when they give him too much homework? \n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s a star baseball player, professor, he shouldn\u2019t have to study like everyone else!! Besides, I drive him to and from school, I can\u2019t wait till he\u2019s done with all his work, that\u2019s just too long!\u201d Ffs", "Wait until he finds out that other young women don\u2019t do this shit. You\u2019re acting like his mommy. He\u2019ll be someone else\u2019s guy in a heartbeat once he sees other girls won\u2019t nag his ass and whine to his coach that her special little man shouldn\u2019t have to do extra work.", "You don\u2019t know anything. You don\u2019t even know the basics of team building and why a coach wouldn\u2019t make an exception because \u201cyour guy\u201d might be a better player.", "Were you ever on a baseball team?", "You HAVE to think it's not true because if it is you'd have to face the fact that you behaved poorly.", "Do you think Reddit is part of your school?", "That\u2019s pathetic and that\u2019s not love!", "Proven by your actions he does not need you as what you did caused him nothing but problems with his team and coach.", "But that's sort of the issue, isn't it? Neither of you are prepared to live an adult life out on your own because you're so wrapped up in each other you can't even imagine that as a possibility. What happens if you break up? Will you each have developed the skills you need to support yourselves logistically and emotionally? Doesn't really sound like it.", "They said that to be nice.

He's going to have a lot of those types in his life in the future.", "So the answer to the question is NO, he did not ask you to step in and help.\n\nI don't think you had bad intentions here, but you really overstepped, and are causing him issues.  I'd apologize to him, and then maybe to the coach as well - you're sorry for interfering, you're just concerned that he's not getting his schoolwork done.  Let him and the coach work it out from there.", "Yuck. I have news for you; your boyfriend isn\u2019t special.", "Since this is someone you're planning to stay with long term, let me give you some advice: You need to ask people before you do things for them. Otherwise, you run the risk of crossing their boundaries, doing something that reflects poorly on them, and creating more problems. If you think what's happening isn't right, you need to bring that up with your partner, discuss the smartest course of action, and respect his final decision. It's his team; his decision. You don't get to go around him and do whatever you want just because you're having strong feelings.", "No, you didn't.", "It was not your place to step in.", "No.no you didn't. There isn't a pro athlete out there that hasn't done their share of clearing prices or cleaning boots, picking up.kits etc because that's how you become a team player. Your fella isn't that special that he gets to skip this bit.", "I'll be kind here and say I hope you guys are the real deal and have a long life together (I know several couples from my high school who are still together almost 30 years later, it's surprising but it does happen), but for your own sake, please do not pin your entire future on him.  The best thing you can do for yourself, and for him, is get an education, gain some skills, have a career and interests and friends outside of his bubble too.  At worst, it makes you self sufficient should something happen to him or your relationship, and at best, it gives you a fulfilling life and makes you a more equal and interesting partner for him.  If he really does go pro, he'll be practicing and traveling a lot, you need to have your own life too.", "You need to stop babying this man and getting involved when not asked to. When he goes to college/academy/ or even into pro sports like you said he\u2019s gonna learn that there are relationships less toxic, controlling, and suffocating than the one with you. Maybe he likes being babied and you like to baby him, but clearly you went too far and need to discuss boundaries. At this rate you\u2019re gonna be together miserably or he\u2019ll break up with realizing there\u2019s healthier relationships. Also think of the future for yourself because you\u2019re gonna torpedo your relationship, if you haven\u2019t already, if you keep this up.", "What are you going to do if that doesn\u2019t pan out for either of you?", "This will likely fall on deaf ears, but what if he gets an injury that prevents him from being able to play? What if your relationship just doesn\u2019t work out? Or worst case, what if he were to pass away unexpectedly? I know you don\u2019t want to think about these as possibilities because they are uncomfortable and due to your age you likely feel like it couldn\u2019t ever happen to *you*, but these are things you genuinely need to consider as they can and do happen to people every single day. \n\nI think you\u2019re too young to be selling yourself short like this and placing all of your eggs in someone else\u2019s basket. You need to be able to support yourself, not rely on someone else as you\u2019re putting yourself at risk by not having a backup plan.", "Yeah, the stud in my HS had amazing career prospects too until he blew out his knee senior year. Take some advice here: figure out a future where you can support yourself and are doing something you want. Relying on \u201cyour guy\u201d to plan your future is only gonna result in heartache.", "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but life IS more complicated than that, whether or not you think it should be. He could get injured during a game, hit by a bus, sick, or any number of other complications. Something could happen to a family member that changes his plans forever. Are you prepared to find work if he can't play? Do you expect that to go well if you don't have an education or any relevant job training? \n\nHaving an exciting path ahead is great, but you'd be short-sighted and naive not to consider any other prospects.", "That sounds like what OP would call *love* based on her comments", "I hate you for this. I haven\u2019t thought about this commercial in nearly a decade.", "Of course she had the right, she's his ride and it was an inconvenience to her. /s", "He ends up selling cars or something with a mistress while she stays at home with the kids she had trying to \"save\" the relationship and they all live lives of quiet desperation.", "I honestly hadn't either until I saw the opportunity and I knew I needed to take it.", "I think the meningitis messed up your head", "And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a delight 24/7.

Red Flag.", "Lol I know right!\n\nIt\u2019s caused HER to be hooooome so late!\n\nI mean she couldn\u2019t possibly let *her guy* get a lift home with someone else. Had to be her!!!!\n\nCathy Bates will play her in the movie edition!", "Hopefully he breaks up with you for trying to be a crazy controlling girlfriend that shouldn\u2019t be involved in his life decisions. You don\u2019t know where the boundaries are and dont have your own life based on other comments. He may not leave you when he goes pro or goes to college but there is also a decent chance he doesn\u2019t wait around for you since he doesn\u2019t have anything riding on your future, you have everything on his.", "That line (amongst everything else) is soooo telling!!!", "You do not have the right to determine his career. I'm sorry that's not how life works. If you stop him going into the navy,your relationship is over anyway as he will resent you."]}
