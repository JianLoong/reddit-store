{"id": 5418, "submission_id": "zsuw74", "title": "AITA for not teaching my daughter to drive?", "selftext": "I have a daughter (18) who currently has a drivers permit, and is intent on learning how to drive. The way it works in our state is that after 18 you must take the written test, and have your permit for a minimum of 30 days or a maximum of 6 months. She is currently on month 3. However, recently she has had behavioral problems that I feel that needed to be addressed. For instance, she does not validate our concerns, is emotional, and is indifferent to our feelings. She does not have the best social skills, and sometimes doesn\u2019t smile to those who greet her at church. She also has expressed not wanting to be around us on Christmas Eve because she has to go into work. She also is a bit prideful when we address her, and I feel like she needs to be more humble. I expressed to her that if she does not change her behavior I will not continue to teach her to drive, even though her drivers permit will expire soon. She has expressed to us that she rather have us take her phone because learning to drive is important to her, and her only chance at freedom. I explained that respect is more important that learning to drive, and we are trying to work on her character?  AITA for the way I am disciplining her?", "created_utc": 1671738140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsuw74/aita_for_not_teaching_my_daughter_to_drive/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The way it works in our state is that after 18 you must take the written test, and have your permit for a minimum of 30 days or a maximum of 6 months. She is currently on month 3. However, recently she has had behavioral problems that I feel that needed to be addressed. For instance, she does not validate our concerns, is emotional, and is indifferent to our feelings. She does not have the best social skills, and sometimes doesn\u2019t smile to those who greet her at church. She also has expressed not wanting to be around us on Christmas Eve because she has to go into work. She also is a bit prideful when we address her, and I feel like she needs to be more humble. I expressed to her that if she does not change her behavior I will not continue to teach her to drive, even though her drivers permit will expire soon. She has expressed to us that she rather have us take her phone because learning to drive is important to her, and her only chance at freedom. I explained that respect is more important that learning to drive, and we are trying to work on her character?

If she is being rude, and you have already tried to teach her to be better, now is the time to let go and allow her to feel the natural consequences of being an AH. I'm a parent too. I'm also a teacher. Sometimes the best lessons are not the ones we get from our parents, but from people that we don't even know. Being controlling won't fix this. Life will. Let her feel it and fall flat on her face a few times. She'll eventually learn to appreciate what you were trying to teach her, but you are going about this all wrong.

I\u2019m betting your daughter is going to go no contact as soon as she can.", "You don't sound like a mentally healthy parent with proper boundaries, respect and love for your daughter, who happens to be an adult and should have freedom. You are purposely stunting her. That's abuse. You are an abuser. You have a lot to be embarrassed about and should have so much shame. You need to apologize profusely and learn to manage your emotions so that you can learn how to have a respectful relationship with your adult child before she leaves you never to contact you again.", "Okay, I have a question for you. \n\nWHy should she care about your feelings when you clearly don't care about hers?\n\nAnd, saying this as a Christian, If your answer to that question is \"because I'm her father\" then you're a failure, not a father.", "Can you provide an example of her not validating your feelings?", "What has she done to treat you unkindly?", "The way you are treating her is not kind. She is not being unkind for having emotions, not smiling as much as you want or wanting to go to work when she's scheduled, even if its on Christmas Eve.", "She's 18, expect her to come around in her late 20s when she's married and have a few kids. Then she will be daddy's sweet girl again. Until then its going to be pretty much this way. Just pretend she doesn't exist and give her the space she needs. Its tough but its how it is. Rarely see many 18 year olds behaving the way you want.", "Still not explaining much here. Who are you trying to get her to smile at? Maybe they\u2019re not good people. You sound like those \u201cwomen should always smile\u201d men. It\u2019s creepy. She\u2019s your daughter. \nWhy are you talking shit about your daughter to other people? And why should she care!?!? \nHonestly hope she finds someone else to teach her how to drive", ">While she does smile at people, it\u2019s not enough. \n\nWhat does that even mean? \n\nYou are upset that she doesn't have friends at church? \n\nIf she smiles and is polite, that's social skills. You are not going to be best friends with your parents friends or even everyone that shares your religion/church. \n\n\n>I just don\u2019t want her to have a mean streak.\n\nAgain what does that even mean? She smiles and is polite. \n\nDid she turn someone down for a date? Is that what all this is about? \n\n\n>When we told her we want to be around her on Christmas Eve she said that she still wants to work.\n\nEntirely rational behavior for an 18yo adult who is doing everything she can to be independent, despite living with the controlling parents she has. \n\nThere is no state in the US that restricts driving to 18. That's your rule. Your extremely controlling rule. \n\nI am the parent of 3 fully adult children. Our job as parents is to raise responsible, imdependant, self-sufficient adults. \n\nYou are failing. And you are trying to prevent her development independent of you. That is wrong and abusive. \n\nYes, YTA. \n\nA misogynistic controlling abusive AH. \n\nIf your daughter was asking for advice, I tell her to save every dime she can, pay for a Driver's Ed course, get her DL and move away and never look back.", "You are practically teaching her that her boundaries don't matter. She's a responsible adult and has a job, and you're refusing to teach her to drive because she has a bad mood sometimes? You're probably one of those keep-sweet Christians who believe that women should always be happy: news flash, YTA. Teach your child to drive and treat her with respect you wish to be treated with.", "Does she work retail? That seems a reasonable job for an 18 year old. If she\u2019s working in any kind of customer service role during the holidays then she is tapped out on your precious smiles.", "You cannot punish someone into having a different personality. If you don\u2019t like your daughter\u2019s personality that is fine, there is no requirement to like people just because they are relatives but you\u2019ll never be successful in trying to control another person into having a personality that you find more appealing.", "You just confirmed everyone's belief that you are overly controlling. That poor girl. It sounds like you want her to be someone else and nothing (in regards to her personality or comportment) is good enough. My mother was like you, so I moved 2,000 miles away from her as soon as I could.  \n\n\nNothing I did was ever good enough. My \"attitude\" was always a problem - but everyone else found me pleasant enough. Whenever I was around her, I faced an unceasing cascade of criticism and nit-picking. The distance has done our relationship good, but I still can't spend more than a week with her without everything devolving into arguments.   \n\n\nYou're the problem here. I bet if you heard her side of the story, you'd find out that she feels that nothing she ever does will be good enough for you.", "No. Just no. Women do not owe people smiles. It doesn\u2019t matter if \u2018she looks so pretty when she smiles\u2019, or if you\u2019re her parent. It\u2019s creepy and controlling. Of course she doesn\u2019t respond anymore! Her own parents are giving her chauvinistic bullshit about smiling more. I would ignore you about that too.", "If she\u2019s 18 and hasn\u2019t learned kindness and empathy already you\u2019ve failed as parents.\n\nYTA for teaching your daughter to do as you say, not as you do.", "You do know that she's required to be at work if she's scheduled to be there, correct?", "You do realize that she's still a teenager, right?  Teens this age want to be independent and tend to go through a rebellious phase during this stage of their life, which is completely normal.  They're discovering who they are.  If you try to over-control them, you're only going to make the rebellion worse and push them away.  If it's any consolation, this phase tends to work itself out by the time they hit their early 20's.  You did your job as a parent and raised her to this stage in life.  Your job is over except to continue to love and support her for who she is.  If you want to continue to have a good relationship with her, stop criticizing everything she does, help her get her license and let her be the independent woman she wants to be.  Otherwise, you'll lose her, maybe forever.\n\nBTW:. Why is it so important to see her on Christmas Eve.  Isn't Christmas the most important day to be with family?  Can't there be a compromise?\n\nSorry, but YTA.", "Your daughter isn't responding because its the best way she can cope with you attacking her unfairly, and it is unfair. Not smiling enough isn't mean, its not having a mean streak. Wanting to work on Christmas Eve, likely because its a requirement for keeping her job, isn't mean. Not caring what you say about her to other people is also not mean or prideful or anything else, its accepting she can't control you.", "You can say that's what you're doing, but what you're actually trying to teach her is to ignore her own feelings and experiences, and that's a very dangerous thing. That's how many women end up assaulted - they are taught to smile and be nice  so they ignore that gut feeling saying, \"this person isn't safe.\"\n\nDid your daughter tell you why she wanted to work Christmas eve? It's very possible it has nothing to do with you, but with the needs of her job. Are you more focused on her being the porcelain doll you imagined having for a daughter? Or on your daughter becoming a full-on functional adult? Adults sometimes have to work when it's not convenient for others. \n\nBased on what I'm reading, YTA. \n\nTeach your daughter to drive.", "Because you don\u2019t bother to validate her feeling. Why would she bother with your feelings?", "Nope. She\u2019s not a child. She\u2019s an adult now. You are shockingly self centered and I think you\u2019d do well to be less self centered. Do you really think your feelings are more important that your child gaining independence and fulfillment?", "Because she wants to escape your Stratford Wife's cult-like household, and she needs her license to do that", "YTA.There is literally nothing you have said that indicates she is self-centered.  She is trying to be her own person instead of being what you are trying to mold her into. \n\nYou can\u2019t change a person\u2019s personality. She is who she is.", "Probably because your feelings are the only things that have mattered her whole life? You\u2019re really trying to call HER self centered, when you feel that you have a right to dictate HER FACIAL EXPRESSIONS??? YTA and clearly from a different planet. Have fun never hearing from her daughter again after she leaves, which I would expect to happen any day now if I were you!", "She was probably more upset about driving than your feelings because you're probably always unhappy with her. So what was new or shocking about that?", "Lol nooope. She\u2019s an adult who you shouldn\u2019t feel the need to \u201cteach\u201d anything. She can be exactly as \u201cfriendly\u201d as she wants, she can work on Christmas Eve if she wants, and she can be as proud as she wants.", "You\u2019re self-centered asking this! She wants to be a functioning adult with the skills she will need for independence. I wouldn\u2019t care about your feelings if you judged me because I didn\u2019t smile enough.", "She\u2019s not a child. She\u2019s an adult, and soon, she\u2019s going to be an adult who has no contact with you.", "Because she knows that either she'll never be able to please you or the things you require of her to please you are harmful to her (and it doesn't matter if you disagree on that because we're talking about her internal experience and how she feels). And because her being able to drive is an essential skill that you're denying her because you're not happy with her for entirely unreasonable reasons. Why don't her feelings matter to you?", "You're child isn't required to validate you or your feelings.  That's a parents jobs. Stop being a weird control freak and let her grow as a person.  Part of growth is making mistakes, getting hurt and hurting people - it's how humans grow and develop.  You're being too demanding and she's bristling against it (as anyone else would).  Be there to catch her if she needs you but you are stunting her right now.", "That\u2019s like the worst one. You should at least find one with good drugs and free love.", "Big hugs from another former Baptist.", "The unbelievable part isn't that there are people like this, it's that they can be simultaneously clueless enough to act like this but still self aware enough to ask if they're in the wrong. Too much cognitive dissonance.", "Like married to an old man?  Who has a slew of wives?  Yuck.", "Why does she HAVE TO smile at people? She doesn't owe randos anything.", "But see here's the fun part:\n\nYou won't know or see if she is an AH when she is on her own because you won't be included in her life. \n\nYou are trying to dictate every aspect of her life to be what YOU want her to be. You don't respect her as her own self. She's an adult. A real life person. Not someone you get to show off to your church buddies. She has 100% say over who she smiles to or who she flips off.\n\nAnd you want her to be more humble. You are a sad, sad, person.", "Why can\u2019t you do both at the same time? This is a weird power play, OP. It is a control issue. You want  to control how she behaves in church. She\u2019s an adult. YTA", "YTA. Practice what you preach.  Show her more love, and think of yourself less.  Being a parent is a privilege, you are not entitled to abuse that privilege.  Help her learn to drive, be more humble instead of you being frustrated she is an individual who wants to develop their skills.", "You haven't really described what exactly she's doing to be \"self centered\" and \"mean\" or what about her \"character\" you don't like.  We can't really give you any real advice until you describe what it is you're trying to fix other than not teaching your 18 year old daughter to drive because you want to control her behavior is a great way to get her to never talk to you again. \n\nThreatening to take her independence away when she relies on you to get it right now and you won't give her ANY positive help towards what you deem to be an issue and only criticizing her is an AH move.", "Nope, you are going to let the next three months run out on her to get her license.  Then what?  You string her along for another 6 months?  Treat her as the adult she is.", "You can\u2019t control who her \u201ccharacter\u201d is, that\u2019s up to one\u2019s self.

Oh yeah and YTA.", "Yes it is. You want her to be nicer to strangers, you took away her phone, and she can\u2019t be home for Christmas Eve because she has to work. This upsets you very much, and because of this behavior you\u2019re refusing to teach her to drive. How is that not controlling? Can you explain that?\n\nYou don\u2019t like her character, so you\u2019re going to punish her until she acts the way you want. That\u2019s controlling. It\u2019s not teaching her respect and manners, it\u2019s teaching her that she won\u2019t want a relationship with you after all this. You don\u2019t have to teach her how to drive and she doesn\u2019t have to have a relationship with you once she moves out.", "Physician, heal thyself.", "No you\u2019re literally setting her up to fail by setting impossible and ridiculous restrictions on her, and then when she can\u2019t or won\u2019t follow your ridiculous controlling rules, you blame her for failing. If she can\u2019t drive her freedom and independence is limited. Why do I get the feeling we aren\u2019t getting the whole story, that you have younger kids you want her to take care of, or she\u2019s basically your family\u2019s maid, or she doesn\u2019t want to follow the (likely patriarchal) religion you\u2019re forcing on her? YTA, OP, and I hope for your daughter\u2019s sake that she finds a way out of your prison sooner rather than later and never has to talk to you again.", "It's a little late to be working on her character.

There is no way you live in this century and believe this nonsense you just dribbled\n\n\"Showing other people love, and thinking of herself less will take her more distances than driving ever will.\"\n\nWith all the challenges women have just trying to exist safely, you want her to humble herself. You don't want her to be confident in who she is, proud of her achievements, and take up space where she made room to be? That's the kind of thinking that won't let women progress. What will take her the distance is her work ethic, her confidence, and her ability to adapt. \n\nAnd at the big age of 18 she is the right age of thinking she knows everything and being prideful, most teens go through this period. \n\nYTA", "She probably won\u2019t have any issues with other people just her terrible parents.", "It absolutely is a control issue if you're trying to cut her off from being able to leave your house and demanding that she acts like she is everyone's inferior", "That's a pretty low excuse. You want her to think less of her own well being and be more concerned about a facade. This is absolutely a control issue on your part. A mentally healthy person would want their child to think of their needs ( within normal boundaries) and not some false narrative. You want a fake happy daughter who expends her energy on emotional vampires like yourself. You would actually have to model and act in love in order to instill it. \n  You may think you are not entitled to teach your child a life skill that gives them authority over their own life. Maybe you aren't. But I guarantee that once she gets a chance, she will leave and never look back at her abuser other than to point a finger and direct her hate and anger. \nThere is something fundamentally wrong with your behavior and thought process.
