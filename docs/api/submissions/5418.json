{"id": 5418, "submission_id": "zsuw74", "title": "AITA for not teaching my daughter to drive?", "selftext": "I have a daughter (18) who currently has a drivers permit, and is intent on learning how to drive. The way it works in our state is that after 18 you must take the written test, and have your permit for a minimum of 30 days or a maximum of 6 months. She is currently on month 3. However, recently she has had behavioral problems that I feel that needed to be addressed. For instance, she does not validate our concerns, is emotional, and is indifferent to our feelings. She does not have the best social skills, and sometimes doesn\u2019t smile to those who greet her at church. She also has expressed not wanting to be around us on Christmas Eve because she has to go into work. She also is a bit prideful when we address her, and I feel like she needs to be more humble. I expressed to her that if she does not change her behavior I will not continue to teach her to drive, even though her drivers permit will expire soon. She has expressed to us that she rather have us take her phone because learning to drive is important to her, and her only chance at freedom. I explained that respect is more important that learning to drive, and we are trying to work on her character?  AITA for the way I am disciplining her?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t realize that treating other people kindly and respecting your parents was not a popular opinion on Reddit. Whenever we talk to our daughter she immediately gets defensive and emotional. I told her that\u2019s insecurity at it\u2019s finest. Even you disagree with your parents you have to remain respectful. Being rude and indifferent is NOT a personality trait, being withdrawn is selfish.  Because you\u2019re only thinking about how you feel. Indifference/coldness will not be tolerated in my house. You must consider other people\u2019s feelings. She needs to learn to listen to criticism before she gets out into the world. She told me that she is nice to her friends, but again, selective kindness is not kind. If she wants to be rude, she needs to move out to do so.\n\nEdit #2 when I reference humility it simply means being able to accept sound wisdom without feeling personally attacked. Which is a sure fire sign of insecurity.", "created_utc": 1671738140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsuw74/aita_for_not_teaching_my_daughter_to_drive/", "score": 973, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This isn\u2019t her \u201cnot being nice\u201d like you *think it is*, this is *the way her personality is, and that\u2019s just not going to change*. You\u2019re punishing her and trying to stifle not just her independence but her *growth* because\u2026 What? She doesn\u2019t smile enough? Your comments admit that you think she\u2019s not nice enough- not *mean*, not nasty, just indifferent and you don\u2019t like it. Sorry, that\u2019s not going to change. Trying to force it is going to actually make it worse. The family members who tried to do this to *me* as a teenager, I have little to no contact with now that I\u2019m in my mid twenties. Why? Because they tried to change who I was, a fundamental part of who I am, because they didn\u2019t think I was good enough. Read that again: *you are telling your daughter that her personality -being introverted- is not good enough for you, her parent*.\n\nYou see this as a slight against you. This is just who your daughter is. And trying to change it, trying to paint her as mean or unfriendly is egregious, and it\u2019s not being a good parent.\n\nEdit to add and change my judgement for real: YTA OP is interpreting what sounds like an introverted nature on her daughters part and not smiling enough to people (and probably a bit of social awkwardness in general, I mean 18 is still a teenager, I didn\u2019t feel any different than 17- I was still a socially awkward teenager when the clock struck eighteen years), as being unfriendly. And while her daughter may shed some of that awkwardness as she grows out of being a teenager, that needs to come at her own pace and time. And being introverted is never going to change, and daughter being some outward overflowing ball of joy and friendliness is a pipe dream OP needs to get rid of.", "YTA.

The way it works in our state is that after 18 you must take the written test, and have your permit for a minimum of 30 days or a maximum of 6 months. She is currently on month 3. However, recently she has had behavioral problems that I feel that needed to be addressed. For instance, she does not validate our concerns, is emotional, and is indifferent to our feelings. She does not have the best social skills, and sometimes doesn\u2019t smile to those who greet her at church. She also has expressed not wanting to be around us on Christmas Eve because she has to go into work. She also is a bit prideful when we address her, and I feel like she needs to be more humble. I expressed to her that if she does not change her behavior I will not continue to teach her to drive, even though her drivers permit will expire soon. She has expressed to us that she rather have us take her phone because learning to drive is important to her, and her only chance at freedom. I explained that respect is more important that learning to drive, and we are trying to work on her character?

I'm also a teacher. Sometimes the best lessons are not the ones we get from our parents, but from people that we don't even know. Being controlling won't fix this. Life will.

Left tire marks when I moved out of that hell hole at 17.  Found my own religion as an adult. Forced Faith is a myth. Either you believe, or you don't. My mother NEVER went to church with us. EVER.", "There are several countries with states or provinces, and especially English as a foreign language speakers may pick up states as the way to translate those since US English is pretty well represented in anywhere they might be picking up the relevant vocab.", "OP doesn't want to teach her to drive because at some level OP knows that once the daughter is independent she will be going NC.", "Yeah sounds like dad is intentionally keeping their daughter from getting a license because they know she's going to go no contact when she can. Your daughter is almost a legal adult, her not smiling in church does not mean you can keep her trapped in your home without the means to leave. My mother was very controlling and I basically had to beg to get my license before I turned 19.", "Then who is? A person with a learners permit cannot drive without a person over 25 with a license in the car with them. If not her parents, who is obligated to?", "The best thing about masks in public was how many women were feeling relieved that they weren\u2019t getting harassed to \u201csmile!\u201d\n\nThis double standard kills me, \u201cwomen should smile at strangers but men can be silent and rude in professional and social settings\u201d\n\nWhen I worked with others in a customer facing job, it bugged me that the teenage girls didn\u2019t need any real training to be polite to customers (I fell like it\u2019s because they are usually made to feel obligated to be friendly in every setting or face negative consequences) while the teenage boys I worked with needed to be told to say \u201cHi, someone will be right with you\u201d etc instead of pretending you don\u2019t see someone just trying to ignore them until another employee walks into the lobby.", "You want to be careful. OP won\u2019t respect your feelings and will punish you too", "These people have a saying for their subservient daughters \u201cbe sweet\u201d. It\u2019s absolutely grooming and disgusting.", "nah, it's the grasping for straws to get a \"reason\" to cut the kid's wings so they can't leave. OP WAS NEVER going to allow that kid to drive if they could stop it, they would.  Only abusive people resort to the logic of smiles for permit!", "Urgh people like that are exhausting and we politely go along with it. He probably thinks he\u2019s a comedy genius and heading for a open mic slot near you!", "What to bet OP is some Quiverfull follower?", "My rage didn\u2019t hit until my mid-40\u2019s. Five years later it still consumes me sometimes, the way my family set me up to be violated and exploited with OP\u2019s attitude.", "100%, I basically had to beg for a learner's permit before I was 18 and beg for my license before I turned 19. Even then it took several more years to finish college and be able to financially support myself. For years she did everything she could to prevent me from having the means to move out from under her constant control and demands to invade my privacy 24/7. Of course when I was finally able to move out the immediate pivot to constant guilt tripping and \"woe-is-me\" stories about her struggles \"without me there to help\" (aka be told to do whatever labor around the house she wants that day). I was happy to do my part around the house but we're talking 15+ hours a week of house work on top of college and working full time to pay my bills and monthly rent that she raised every time I made more money. I'm approaching 30 and I basically had to gnaw the umbilical cord off to escape. At least over phone calls I can roll my eyes as much as I want.", "Oh I have had RBF since a child. My niece is the same poor kid", "It does indeed.", "I saw a TikTok video yesterday of a girl who was in musical theater. During rehearsal, she looked bored and unenthusiastic. Mom made the mistake of telling her to smile during the show. Smile, she did. She had the most insane and crazed look on her face and she stared at her mom the whole time. It was amazing. That girl is going to be a force to be reckoned with when she grows up.", "This happened to me on my first day back at work after my dad died. \u201cSmile! Nothing\u2019s that bad!\u201d So I burst into tears and said my dad just died go fuck yourself, and the look of horror on his face was priceless. Hopefully he learned to leave random women alone.\n\nOn a funnier note i was walking past a pub and there was a guy outside having a smoke and he started the \u201csmile\u201d thing. I didn\u2019t even stop walking. As soon as he said smile I said fuck off and didn\u2019t even look at him or break my stride.", "I was also forced to go to church (southern baptist) whenever the doors were open until I was 18 and left for college. I haven't been back since. Some of the most awful people I ever met were at church.", "Everyone smiles when Bossman walks into the room! That\u2019s how life works for him!"]}
