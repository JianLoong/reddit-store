My younger brother has always been the golden child between the both of us to my mom (not to my dad). Him and his fianc\u00e9e currently live with her, rent free might I add.\n\nMy dad and I on the other hand have mixed feelings about this wedding. We both feel like my brother is rushing into thing's and not being financially smart. He just finished his bachelor program a year ago, is still trying to get on his feet and find a good full time job in his field, and decides to spend thousands of dollars on a wedding?\n\nWe sat him down and explained this to him and asked him what the rush was? Why not push it off for a few years and save up so you guys can really have the wedding of your dreams?\n\nHe explained to us that his fianc\u00e9e wants the wedding as soon as possible and doesn't want to wait. \n\nWell his fianc\u00e9e's family is pitching in a couple thousand for the wedding, my dad reluctantly is pitching in a couple thousand as well (all important later).\n\nWell a few nights ago I'm eating dinner with my husband when I get a call from my future SIL. Convo starts our normal \"hey how are you?\" \"shitty weather we're having\" etc etc, until she tells me she has a serious question to ask me.\n\nShe asks me if she can use my wedding dress, that I wore to my wedding JUST OVER A YEAR AGO. She explains that she can't afford one herself, that she absolutely LOVES mine and that it would be her \"something borrowed\". \n\nI immediately shut her down and said I'm sorry but no, this is a THOUSANDS of dollars dress we're talking about, that she'd have to get altered to fit her btw too, so no way. We're also not even close at all and barely talk so like wtf?\n\nShe starts begging and even starts CRYING and going on about how she can't afford one. I told her i'm sorry but no. She then starts going on about how I'm not even financially helping her and my brother pay for the wedding, so the least I can do is let her use my dress.\n\nI told her the honest truth, that I think they're rushing into having a wedding and not being financially smart. She said she didn't care, she has a timeline and wants to be married by 25. \n\nI basically said to her that she made her bed so now she has to lie in it, and figure it out herself, and if she can't afford her WEDDING DRESS then she should be having a wedding. Simple as that. \n\nShe ran back to my mom and my brother to tell them what I said. They think I'm an AH because I have the money to financially help my brother and his fianc\u00e9e, but I'm being \"selfish\" and \"unsupportive\". They also think \"it's just a dress so what's the big deal\".\n\n My dad is on my side and defending me and is now thinking of taking back his financial help due to the sheer audacity of my brother fianc\u00e9e asking me such a thing.", "created_utc": 1679405456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xgy8f/aita_for_not_letting_my_sil_use_my_wedding_dress/", "score": 193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you don't want to that is up to you, it's your dress after all and just because you have the money to help someone doesn't mean you are obligated to do so.

Blows my mind how entitled some can be.", "NTA\n\nFor every single reason you just stated.  I would NOT let her borrow that dress.

Of course you said no. There are wedding dresses not so expensive out there. She can use one of those. Or she can postpone the wedding until she and your brother have all their ducks in a row.

Are they even working? A court house wedding is still a wedding and much cheaper. The absolute entitlement that other people should fund their wedding is astounding.", "NTA. It's insane to me the increased entitlement people seem to be having over family members having to contribute to a wedding. Traditionally, maybe parents kick in a little bit- but siblings?!? This is delusional IMO. And she is definitely TA for essentially throwing a tantrum when you said no about her using your dress.", "NTA. Future SIL has a lot of nerve demanding to borrow your dress. Especially since A) You aren't that close to her. B) The dress, which cost thousands of dollars, would have to be altered. Making it not Your dress anymore. C) They can't afford to buy their own dress. Meaning they can't really afford to get married. \n\nStand your ground on this.", "NTA that is your dress. This is exactly why they shouldn\u2019t rush into a wedding. If having a beautiful wedding dress is such a priority, they should put off the wedding. But she wants to get married asap, so she has to accept what she can afford.", "NTA especially since the dress would need to be altered", "NTA - just because you have something doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obligated to give it to someone else.

Literally the cost of the marriage license is all that's required.\n\nIf they want a big, expensive wedding they need to wait until they can afford it.  If they cannot afford the wedding they envision, then they need to alter their vision.\n\nThere are many consignment shops, thrift stores, other resale shops like Goodwill that carry wedding dresses that are in good shape for less than $100.\n\nThere are also places that rent wedding dresses.\n\nYou said\n\nShe then starts going on about how I'm not even financially helping her and my brother pay for the wedding, so the least I can do is let her use my dress.\n\nNope, the least you can do is nothing, which if i were you, nothing is exactly what i would do.\n\nYou said \nMy mom& brother think I'm an AH because I have the money to financially help my brother and his fianc\u00e9e, but I'm being \"selfish\" and \"unsupportive\". They also think \"it's just a dress so what's the big deal\".\n\nOk, great, your mom and brother are personally invested in supporting your brother's immature, demanding, entitled fiance, so they should definitely spend their money to buy her a wedding dress.\n\nHope your soon to be married brother wakes up to the life he will have if he marries his fiance, before it is too late.\n\nNext thing you know they will be demanding someone buy them a home or a car, because they want one and dont want to wait.  Better to bring their entitlement to a screeching halt.\n\nIf they cannot even afford to live alone it is ridiculous to expect others to fund a lavish wedding.", "NTA\n\nMy sisters dress was $120, brand new, and she looked absolutely amazing. I\u2019m sure she could fit a thrifted dress into her budget, and it would still be something borrowed!", "NTA. Not your fault she has champagne dreams and a canned tuna budget.", "NTA\n\nI don't think she was an asshole to *ask*. Obviously you're never going to wear the dress again, and it's not doing anyone any good just hiding in a closet or in storage somewhere. \n\nBut she should have accepted \"no\" for an answer.", "NTA and your dad should take his money back. The nerve.", "NTA. Goodwill/ thrift shops have lots of wedding dresses to choose from. She can also look at online retailers.

If you\u2019re too poor to afford what you really want, you need to be resourceful and not expect everyone to cater to you. Only thing I\u2019d add OP is not to give her any reasons for your responses in the future. The response of: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to lend it out\u201d is fine.

What they want is to have a big fancy wedding that is not feasible in their current situation.", "NTA they sound entitled and ridiculous. Your finances are your business which you work for. Just because your doing well doesn\u2019t entitle anyone to your hard earned money, especially not for a wedding. You are not their parents you are his sister and do not owe them anything. I hate it when brides act like they\u2019re entitled to some else\u2019s dress just because they\u2019re getting married. It\u2019s your dress and you have every right to keep it. Ignore them. You set your boundaries and said your peace be sure they can\u2019t get hold of your dress. Good luck", "NTA. Its your dress. Its yours to do with as you please. Sil can go to dillards, pick out a white prom dress, and accessorize thst as her brudal attire.", "NTA \n\nIf they can't afford it go to the courthouse like we did. Then have a really nice reception the next day. My family cooked all the food and we had it at my aunt and uncles barn. We saved so much money (I got married in carhartt  button up and shorts) it was so informal and relaxing. I don't get this needing to have a huge wedding you can't afford nonsense. Specially if they're in a rush to get married on a time crunch.", "NTA. I\u2019m looking at wedding dresses at the moment and not only are there beautiful ones under $500 (especially if you look for sales) but I just found my dream dress and it\u2019s under $200. And this is from a bridal shop too, not Amazon or online. If she really wants an immediate wedding that means giving up parts of a \u201cdream wedding\u201d if needed.", "NTA.\n\nThrow their argument back at them, It's \"just a dress\" so what's the big deal? She can get married in any dress then, right? Because it's just a dress and no big deal? If it's not a big deal,they need to stop making it a big deal and leave you alone.", "NTA\n\nThere are lovely dresses via Lulu\u2019s and on ASOS that come in under $150. A marriage license in Los Angeles is $91. \n\nSo wherever they are, I\u2019m sure that if they can find $400 to rub together, they can dress nicely and get married. And *marriage* is what\u2019s important, right? (except apparently not)", "NTA.\n\nThey chose to marry young without a lot of means. That means making budget cuts.\n\nShe can always rent a nice wedding dress.", "NTA. The entitlement of the girl is beyond comprehension.", "Can't afford a wedding? Don't get married. NTA", "NTA and I feel sorry for your brother.  She wants to be married by 25.  That is the only reason she is marrying your brother.  No foundation at all.  Your dress.  If you can't afford your own dress, then you definitely shouldn't be getting married.", "NTA - This is literally not your problem. \n\nI would keep my comments to myself, but outside of that, there is no reason you should be financing a thing for this wedding or being forced to loan this girl the dress.", "Yta. I understand that the dress might be sentimental but honestly it\u2019s a dress you will never wear again and somebody somewhere down the line is going to give it away or to good will. Due your brother a solid and let them have the dress. Your personal feelings about your brother\u2019s finances are honestly ill conceived. Let him be happy however he thinks it needs to be done. Besides you telling your brother how to live his life is going to fall on deaf ears. Even if you are right. Especially if you are right.", "Nah\u2026 five year old", ">NTA who pays for their siblings wedding come on now\n\nAgreed, She should be using her money for her family with her husband not a sibling. Saving for a home or future kids college!", "\"it's just a dress so what's the big deal\"", "Who ever wears their wedding g dress again?", "And given the maturity level here, I'd say this marriage is going to last less than a year anyway. Not worth having your wedding dress altered and ruined.", "Last time I checked OP wouldn\u2019t been needing it any longer.", "Thanks for the compliment to my dad, but I don't think he's a girlboss - I'm pretty sure that's not a term that should be exclusively reserved for men who don't let their SILs wear their wedding dresses.", "Many of us have emotional attachments to things. There doesn't really have to be a reason for keeping it other than just getting a warm fuzzy feeling when you see it.", "The fabric can be used if it\u2019s in good shape still. I had our kids christening gowns made out of my wedding dress. (I was married in early 90s so think big hair, puffy princess dresses & miles of train) I had those professionally cleaned & stored so our kids can use them for their kids (if they choose to) & then they can do whatever they want with them. Basically, I just passed on my problem of disposing the dress lol", "If it\u2019s of really good quality she may be intending to pass it on to the next generation, especially if she has her own kids. A lot of people do that, and even though my mom and I are vastly different sizes she wanted me to incorporate some aspect of her dress into mine. (I don\u2019t know where that stands cause I don\u2019t know if she still has the dress she married my dad in, and I\u2019m not incorporating anything from her second wedding.)", "Because she can pass it on to her kid? Cuz there is sentimental value. She only got married in jr a year ago?", "Because she wants to exact revenge on her golden child brother.", "I wore my mom's wedding dress for our engagement photos and my bridal shower. She got married in 1972, and mom grandmother crocheted the entire thing. I had it altered a bit, and it was lovely. I also had a piece of it sewn into my dress.", "I get not understanding the sentimentality of the dress.  It I'm not sure where you are getting the impression that she was trying to bond and create a relationship. She pretty clearly was hoping to get an expensive dress for free, nothing about bonding.", "tbf it\u2019s not *just* borrowed but OP stated that the wedding dress would have to get altered to fit FSIL, i think OP is in the right to not want to lend her dress to someone she barely knows.", "Okay - but the fact it would need to be altered (which can cost hundreds of dollars itself), and is something she might want to pass on to her future child, etc. doesn't make it a 'simple choice' to just say 'go for it'. \n\nI would certainly loan someone a trade paperback if they wanted to get into a comic series. I absolutely would NOT loan someone the mint first editions I keep in sleeves. The first rule of loaning something is you have to be okay with it getting damaged. I don't blame OP for not being willing to accept that risk for something that is senitmental, expensive, and could possibly be passed to her own children.", "Except she clearly said the dress would have to be altered to fit SIL, I'm not a woman myself but I know I wouldn't want such a nice memory altered forever, and what If she's saving it for her kids??", "I know a few people who wore their wedding dresses when they renewed their vows. I know others who have kept theirs for their daughters.", "How do you know what she plans to do with it? She may want to keep it for her future daughter or have it altered for herself to make into a wearable dress or sell it", "That doesn\u2019t matter? It\u2019s of sentimental value to OP, she has absolutely no obligation to give it away", "And if she chose to pass it down to her daughter? It\u2019s a common tradition", "This made me chuckle... \u201cIt\u2019s a hard no on anything \u201cborrowed\u201d from Mom\u2019s second wedding\u201d. LOL", "Seems like this is accurate ... it\u2019s not a horrible plan.", "She specifically said \u201cSomething borrowed\u201d when she asked for it.", "Exactly. There is a chance it could come back fine, just some alterations. Or it could get a giant red wine stain on it, meaning she couldn't pass it down to her kids, loan it to a close friend, or even just decide to donate it in a few years (it has only been a year since the wedding, lots of emotions about it now that might not be there in 5 years)", "She\u2019s gonna rewear her wedding dress? Lol", "I never said she was. It\u2019s just clearly about hurting her brother and not the dress.", "No it isn\u2019t. I\u2019d be surprised if 1% of brides do. And op doesn\u2019t mention that.", "To add to that, if I can have my way, there will be NOTHING from her second wedding there, including the husband. But we will have to see.", "With the rest of the context, that doesn't sound like an attempt at bonding, it sounds like guilt tripping.\n\nIf she'd truly cared about bonding and not the dress, she could have also suggested that maybe she could borrow the earrings OP had worn or some other item. Going straight to the dress, and only the dress, and then having a tantrum over not getting it isn't trying to bond.", "It can be used in other ways.  Like people I know had their kids and grandkids get a portion for the ring pillows.  It was so cherished by everyone.  There's ways to use it", "I mean I literally listed things she may want to do with it.......\"lol\"", "It\u2019s pretty common for people to wear their dress again for anniversaries or a vow renewal. Some also get it altered to a cocktail dress. \n\nI know people who had a section taken from their wedding dress to make a christening outfit for their kid. \n\nPeople do all sorts of things with their dress, because it\u2019s theirs. Not wanting to give it to the SIL doesn\u2019t make OP an AH", "It really doesn\u2019t matter what plans she has for the dress.\n\nShe spent thousands of her own money on it.\n\nShe gets to decide how it\u2019s used. \n\nThis isn\u2019t like borrowing an umbrella.", "I\u2019ve got no idea where you\u2019ve got that from so it\u2019s not so clear after all. Why would she want to hurt her brother?\n\nHer brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 had an unreasonable request (asking for an item with sentimental value) and threw a tantrum when she couldn\u2019t have it.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to get married then don\u2019t get married.", "I know people who have taken it apart and use parts of it for their kids and grandkids to use as the ring pillow.  Was something really special for them..", "As a wedding planner I completely understand ... family dynamics are always a little game of chess. Move the pieces in the right way... you can have it your way & win!", "I read the rest of the context as being completely one sided and biased. There isn\u2019t a thing about it that reads as an objective telling of the story.", "Yeah, like letting your future sil use it.", "Op didn\u2019t. You did. Op doesn\u2019t care about the dress as much as making her brother miserable.", "I never said it made her an AH for saying no. She\u2019s an AH for the reasons she is saying no, which are to punish her brother and exact revenge on him for being the \u201cgolden child.\u201d Her entire post is a hate-fest about him. The dress is incidental.", "I agree. I don\u2019t know why it was brought up.", "And where in the post does the op even hint at that? No where. This isn\u2019t about the dress.", "Thank you. I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way. I always saw it as more of a brute force arm wrestling match where it was my will against theirs. Thinking of it like chess is a lot more calming.", "Oh yeah, there are definitely some issues with her brother and future-SIL seeping through. But it also doesn't sound like unearned frustration. i tend to judge based on facts given, not my own projection. And in this case, who expects everyone to pay for your fancy wedding because you insist on being married by 25?  That's when you either wait to get married or have the smaller wedding.\n\nOr gets upset when someone won't just give you their wedding dress because you want it? Personally I don't get that attached to items, but some people do. Asking is fine, not taking the no isn't.", "And possibly ruin it.  Nope.", "Is this the future SIL??", "I think that's a bit of a leap on your part, it's not like it's an odd reaction for the OP to not want to give her dress away to someone, I think a hell of a lot of people would rather not do that especially when they only got married last year too", "Hate-fest? Really?\n\nI didn\u2019t get that vibe from the post.", "Because you keep insisting she should give the dress away to make her brother happy.", "People change their mind after having kids or as time does on. That's her choice.  She's had the dress for a year only.  She still wants her dress.", "Nobody is asking anyone to pay for the wedding. Op decided it was her place to tell her brother not to get married. I\u2019d get upset if I asked for something and the response was to berate me and tell me what a mistake I\u2019m making. She didn\u2019t just say no, she took out all her issues on this girl.", "Op makes NO reference to saving the dress for anything. This is about her brother, not the dress", "You can read that post and not see her anger towards her brother written all over it?", "I never said any such thing. The dress is incidental. Inflicting pain on her brother intentionally an maliciously is why she\u2019s an AH", "I don\u2019t believe she does still want the dress as much as she doesn\u2019t want her future sil to have it after the page long diatribe about how awful and stupid her brother is.", "Did you miss the part where her parents are paying for part of it, they've worn down her dad into paying for part of it, and then are saying OP owes her the dress because she's not contributing any money to the wedding?\n\nThat sure sounds a lot like expecting other people to pay for her dream wedding to me.\n\nAnd it sounds like she said no, SIL didn't just take the no and started berating her for not helping pay for the wedding and so OP started giving her reasons for the no. Could it have been done better? Probably. But it doesn't sound like it was something that just came up without provocation.", "Except the SIL and brother and mom said said themselves she is being cheap for not paying, that's worse than asking. And clearly sister in law didn't want to bond, you don't send your flying monkeys if you are a decent person.", "She may have been willing to give her dress to someone who she had built a long relationship with and really cared about.  And a relationship that she could see as long lasting.   So yeah it's about the dress and the relationship. And the timeline how it's only been a year.", "Hey, future SIL, you're still not getting the dress no matter how many stories you make up about how she'll never use the dress again. No means NO.", "I missed that, but my comment still stands because using the sil\u2019s dress isn\u2019t payment.", "Oh the SIL said it? Well then it\u2019s certainly true.", "How did you miss that? It was literally most of the context of the post! It sounds like you are doing some of your own projecting here rather than actually responding to the context of the post.\n\nGiving the dress to SIL would be the equivalent of giving her thousands of dollars for a dress. It's not like it's just some small little token, it would be a huge give.", "Also regardless of the wanting to bond part, not wanting your wedding dress to be permanently altered is such a valid reason to not lend it, what about saving it for kids too? AITA has lately been having this entitlement over someone else's stuff lately, like the OP renting his brother post."]}
