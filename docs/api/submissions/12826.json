My younger brother has always been the golden child between the both of us to my mom (not to my dad). Him and his fianc\u00e9e currently live with her, rent free might I add.\n\nMy dad and I on the other hand have mixed feelings about this wedding. We both feel like my brother is rushing into thing's and not being financially smart. He just finished his bachelor program a year ago, is still trying to get on his feet and find a good full time job in his field, and decides to spend thousands of dollars on a wedding?\n\nWe sat him down and explained this to him and asked him what the rush was? Why not push it off for a few years and save up so you guys can really have the wedding of your dreams?\n\nHe explained to us that his fianc\u00e9e wants the wedding as soon as possible and doesn't want to wait. \n\nWell his fianc\u00e9e's family is pitching in a couple thousand for the wedding, my dad reluctantly is pitching in a couple thousand as well (all important later).\n\nWell a few nights ago I'm eating dinner with my husband when I get a call from my future SIL. Convo starts our normal \"hey how are you?\" \"shitty weather we're having\" etc etc, until she tells me she has a serious question to ask me.\n\nShe asks me if she can use my wedding dress, that I wore to my wedding JUST OVER A YEAR AGO. She explains that she can't afford one herself, that she absolutely LOVES mine and that it would be her \"something borrowed\". \n\nI immediately shut her down and said I'm sorry but no, this is a THOUSANDS of dollars dress we're talking about, that she'd have to get altered to fit her btw too, so no way. We're also not even close at all and barely talk so like wtf?\n\nShe starts begging and even starts CRYING and going on about how she can't afford one. I told her i'm sorry but no. She then starts going on about how I'm not even financially helping her and my brother pay for the wedding, so the least I can do is let her use my dress.\n\nI told her the honest truth, that I think they're rushing into having a wedding and not being financially smart. She said she didn't care, she has a timeline and wants to be married by 25. \n\nI basically said to her that she made her bed so now she has to lie in it, and figure it out herself, and if she can't afford her WEDDING DRESS then she should be having a wedding. Simple as that. \n\nShe ran back to my mom and my brother to tell them what I said. They think I'm an AH because I have the money to financially help my brother and his fianc\u00e9e, but I'm being \"selfish\" and \"unsupportive\". They also think \"it's just a dress so what's the big deal\".\n\n My dad is on my side and defending me and is now thinking of taking back his financial help due to the sheer audacity of my brother fianc\u00e9e asking me such a thing.", "created_utc": 1679405456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xgy8f/aita_for_not_letting_my_sil_use_my_wedding_dress/", "score": 8846, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course you said no. There are wedding dresses not so expensive out there. She can use one of those. Or she can postpone the wedding until she and your brother have all their ducks in a row.

Are they even working? A court house wedding is still a wedding and much cheaper. The absolute entitlement that other people should fund their wedding is astounding.", "NTA. It's insane to me the increased entitlement people seem to be having over family members having to contribute to a wedding. Traditionally, maybe parents kick in a little bit- but siblings?!? This is delusional IMO. And she is definitely TA for essentially throwing a tantrum when you said no about her using your dress.", "NTA. Future SIL has a lot of nerve demanding to borrow your dress. Especially since A) You aren't that close to her. B) The dress, which cost thousands of dollars, would have to be altered. Making it not Your dress anymore. C) They can't afford to buy their own dress. Meaning they can't really afford to get married. \n\nStand your ground on this.", "NTA that is your dress. This is exactly why they shouldn\u2019t rush into a wedding. If having a beautiful wedding dress is such a priority, they should put off the wedding.

Literally the cost of the marriage license is all that's required.\n\nIf they want a big, expensive wedding they need to wait until they can afford it.  If they cannot afford the wedding they envision, then they need to alter their vision.\n\nThere are many consignment shops, thrift stores, other resale shops like Goodwill that carry wedding dresses that are in good shape for less than $100.\n\nThere are also places that rent wedding dresses.\n\nYou said\n\nShe then starts going on about how I'm not even financially helping her and my brother pay for the wedding, so the least I can do is let her use my dress.\n\nNope, the least you can do is nothing, which if i were you, nothing is exactly what i would do.\n\nYou said \nMy mom& brother think I'm an AH because I have the money to financially help my brother and his fianc\u00e9e, but I'm being \"selfish\" and \"unsupportive\". They also think \"it's just a dress so what's the big deal\".\n\nOk, great, your mom and brother are personally invested in supporting your brother's immature, demanding, entitled fiance, so they should definitely spend their money to buy her a wedding dress.\n\nHope your soon to be married brother wakes up to the life he will have if he marries his fiance, before it is too late.\n\nNext thing you know they will be demanding someone buy them a home or a car, because they want one and dont want to wait.  Better to bring their entitlement to a screeching halt.\n\nIf they cannot even afford to live alone it is ridiculous to expect others to fund a lavish wedding.", "NTA\n\nMy sisters dress was $120, brand new, and she looked absolutely amazing. I\u2019m sure she could fit a thrifted dress into her budget, and it would still be something borrowed!", "NTA. Not your fault she has champagne dreams and a canned tuna budget.", "NTA\n\nI don't think she was an asshole to *ask*. Obviously you're never going to wear the dress again, and it's not doing anyone any good just hiding in a closet or in storage somewhere. \n\nBut she should have accepted \"no\" for an answer.", "NTA and your dad should take his money back.

If you\u2019re too poor to afford what you really want, you need to be resourceful and not expect everyone to cater to you.

Heading towards **Entitlement.**  Tears alone don't make this manipulation.  What makes it manipulative is the sequence.  Your decision, her refusal to accept it, her begging, then crying, to try to force your compliance.\n3. *going on about how she can't afford one.*   With two parents giving a couple thousand each, **she could buy her dream dress, a nice cake, and a simple cheap venue** like a park with some hired people to dish up the cake.  What she can't afford is the dream **she wants other people to finance for her.**\n4. *starts going on about how I'm not even financially helping her and my brother pay for the wedding,* **Manipulation by Guilt Trip and Obligation.**  These are two of the big three manipulation tactics that make FOG.  The other is fear.  Together these three get and keep people under the manipulator's control.   You have no obligation to fund her event for her.  **How much money you have isn't the point.  Your money isn't hers to control,** and shouldn't be taken into consideration when she makes plans or goals for her life.   That she even brings this up makes me think that she really does think she should have your money, too.\n5. *so the least I can do is let her use my dress.*  Not true.  **The least you can do is nothing at all.  You have no obligation to fund her dream** wedding for her.  Now, that she's shown how manipulative and entitled she is, she's proven your foresight to be right, that this wedding is a mistake.  **Time to shift to Protect Yourself mode around her.**\n6. *she has a timeline and wants to be married by 25.*  Well, goals are important, to motivate ourselves.  But adults do not expect other people to do the work for them to achieve their goals.  She's very immature and is now trying **another manipulation that is often used by abusive people:  trying to make their responsibilities into your responsibility.**  \n7. *She ran back to my mom and my brother to tell them what I said.*   **Another manipulation tactic:  \"flying monkeys.**\"   She didn't get what she wanted, so **she's trying to make someone else get it for her.**\n8. *They think I'm an AH*  They are wrong.  Compliance would be enabling.  **Not complying to the demands of a manipulator isn't being an AH, it's doing what's healthy.  It's protecting yourself.**  It's avoiding joining with the enablers to enable this manipulator to hurt other people more and more easily and to not be faced with the reality that her behavior is wrong.  Them enabling her isn't healthy for them, or for her, or for anyone else.\n9. *because I have the money to financially help my brother and his fianc\u00e9e, but I'm being \"selfish\" and \"unsupportive\".*   **Adults make their own choices** what to do with their money.  **Adults make their own choices how they are available to support** their siblings and other relatives.  Demanding your money is not what good family does to each other.  **Demanding that other relatives comply, that's abusive behavior,** not support.  Support is when you show up at the wedding and smile and wear uncomfortable clothes for them.  It's when you listen to their problems.  \n10.  *\"it's just a dress so what's the big deal\"*   It's ***your*** dress.  Not theirs to make decisions about.  **The big deal here is that this person isn't accepting your decision** about your possession, **and is trying all kinds of manipulations to force you to comply with her demand.**  Whether she calls it a demand or not, it is one.  **The big deal is her bad behavior** that is screaming red flags of manipulation and potentially, abuse.\n11. **Belittling and humiliating you** about your dress isn't being kind or loving to you.  **It's what manipulators and abusers do, though, to get compliance.**  When this is a pattern of behavior, it can be a contribution to emotional abuse. That it's showing up here, with all the other red flags of manipulation is a major concern.  I hope your brother wakes up to the red flags of this person and doesn't marry her.\n12. *My dad is on my side and defending me*  Good.  It's time to say to all of their comments:  **\"I've made my decision.  I'm not discussing this again.\"**   I'd think sixteen times before agreeing to do anything with this person, and take the time to step back and have a few weeks to consider first, before agreeing to be involved in any possible way. \n13. *and is now thinking of taking back his financial help due to the sheer audacity of my brother fianc\u00e9e asking me such a thing.*  Asking was fine.  **Refusing to accept your answer, and then embarking on this mess of manipulations, that's the big issue here**.   This person is showing you all who she is:  manipulative, selfish, thinks her responsibilities should be handled by others for her, wants her wants without consideration of other people at all, expects others to pay for her to have her dreams, and sees no problem with creating a big stink when she doesn't get her expectations from others.  \n14. You and your dad are the ones with open eyes.  I hope your mother and brother can take some time to rethink this. **\"Have you thought seriously about what kind of person will refuse to accept the decisions of other adults, who creates this kind of drama when someone tells them \"no\"?\"**   My MIL was like this.

Their only plan is to stay with Mom as long as possible.", "Sounds like she did make a financial plan, it's just that the financial plan is \"everyone else can take care of me\".", "Who in their right mind would just GIVE an expensive dress to someone they don\u2019t talk to? Especially if alterations are required? If I spent my hard-earned money on a nice gown that has sentimental value to me, I wouldn\u2019t just give it to someone who is just demanding I give it to them.\n\nA couple thousand on a gown isn\u2019t that uncommon. Beading, good quality fabrics, lace, all of that is very expensive. Is that affordable to everyone? No. there are more affordable dresses out there. FSIL doesn\u2019t NEED OP\u2019s dress.", "I agree with you. The OP sounds condescending and mean. Also the conversation she explained sounds very one sided and fabricated. I doubt it went down the way she said it did. 25 is not too young for marriage and her saying that to the fsil told me everything I needed to know about what kind of person she is.", "Agree also going into how her brother is the favorite reeks of unresolved resentment towards her brother which is at least partially motivating her decision.", "Goals: married by 25 so she can get divorced by 26.\n\nNothing wrong with marrying early if you **find the right person**.

I didn't want anything traditional and ended up with the most beautiful dress that I'm pretty sure is actually a bridesmaid dress but it was I think around $300. I wouldn't even hand that over if someone asked. This girl just needs to straighten out her priorities, buckle up, and prepare to go to a bunch of places until she finds something she loves that's in her budget.", "It's the LEAST she can do , considering she isn't helping to pay for the wedding that isn't hers and that she is against.", "It\u2019s in the timeline im sure.", "This!! I got married without a hall or a reception.. my backyard, a friend who was ordained, family/loved ones, and a grill.. that\u2019s all it took and I could not of been happier! A friend took care of the grilling (voluntarily I might add as I planned to get the food cooked) and we had a great party in my garage.. my hands were tied on a few things I wanted due to the pandemic (not able to get items or restrictions of guests) but our love prevailed and it is an amazing memory I cherish.. I didn\u2019t even have a wedding dress.. op NTA", "Oof", "Living with mother in law for life! Forgot about that", "My bff was a little like this in college. She was pretty bummed her college bf didn\u2019t turn into a husband.

But she moved on, went to graduate school and met her future hubby there lol", "Can you salvage some lace or floral motif for her to incorporate into her dress? Mine was too short for my daughter so I cut a floral lace bit , crocheted a blue heart to go with. Florist attached the \u201csomething old, something blue\u201d to her bouquet with a sterling heart charm.\nShe loved having something of my gown with her that day \ud83d\udc99", "After my divorce, I put mine on Craigslist and the nicest older man wanted to buy it for his wife for their 35th anniversary (or something like that). They wanted to dress up again. It was so sweet.", "i haven't gotten married yet but I'm (albeit heavily) altering this white prom type dress! \nit cost like $8 bucks from a thrift store so I'm dyeing it, adding flowers and etc!\nshe has plenty of options and even if she wants a \"perfect\" dress there's plenty of easy ways to up even a second hand prom dress", "100%.

If your FSIL doesn\u2019t face reality, everything will end badly.", "My first wedding, many years ago was quite traditional and very nice. My second wedding, many years later was at the local court house. They had a very nice setup with an archway covered in flowers ( fake.) My mom, brother and son were with us. I wore a white dress with a black diagonal edging. After the ceremony, went to a nice restaurant, and brought our own wedding cake. ( We had been living together for 20 years at that point.) Still going strong.", "Because she wants a dress that costs thousands of dollars even though she can't afford it - much like deciding she HAS to be married by 25", "Then one day a young unmarried couple buys the house. They discover the forbidden artifact left forgotten in the attic, decide to use it for the wedding, and it all goes downhill from there.", "True story!", "oh, very nice. Thank you!", "Cool story", "I got the discontinued floor model too! It still was a bit pricey, but for a raw silk wedding dress, it was dirt cheap.", "I found mine for $300 on Etsy. An,off'white, vintage tulle prom dress with a yellow sash. I LOVE IT. And it's one-of-a-kind. \n\nI see both sides here. But honestly, I wouldn't want anyone wearing my dress bc it's special to me, you know? You could offer to go shopping & help her find a dress? Maybe don't bring up that how you feel about their finances- bc they're adults & it's not really your place. But it is your place to kindly decline to give her your wedding dress.", "NTA- I just bought an evening dress for my wedding dress and it cost me \u00a331!", "Yep. Asking once? Not a problem. Doesn't hurt to check. But it should have been dropped after that.", "I'm coming up on my 10 year anniversary. I had a custom dress picked out, then fell pregnant with my eldest (despite TWO types of birth control!), and had to rapidly figure something else out. Which ended up being a David's Bridal dress in an empire cut. I just wanted a dress to fit me day of, but looking back? I was so gorgeous. Even more so for our daughter inside me while we made our vows.\n\nWe can have all sorts of ideas about the day of our marriage, but in the end, really nothing should be able to \"spoil\" it. For my husband and I? We had a typhoon that caused us day-of to change venue, the bridal party was literally starved because my mother failed to show up with food the morning of, my \"dad\" (uncle actually but dad in every other way) got drunk and lost and almost didn't make it to walk me down the aisle...\n\nNone of that stress matters in the rear-view. I still see that day as being absolutely \"perfect\". It's not fair to assume everyone has the same values as you, I totally get that. However? I would lose my shit at my partner acting this entitled, especially for material things. It's just beyond gross.", "OP needs to find out her dream honeymoon place and vacation there with her hubby and dad when the brother is getting married. I'm just petty that way.", "Also, if it\u2019s \u201conly a dress\u201d and it\u2019s not a big deal, she can buy a cheaper dress. The nerve of some people.", "Seriously! I got married for the cost of the license at the courthouse. Being married does NOT mean having a lavish expensive party. That's just a choice. They could get married and have the \"wedding\" when they can afford it without trying to use the family for money. NTA.", "Right it's supposed to be about the two people joining. Nice to have friends and family there but if you are living with his mom, it's ridiculous to get spendy on a wedding.", "OP could have kept it at no, if the future SIL had accepted the initial no.", "Yep. If you're in budget? Do what you want. But the wedding and honeymoon should be the last priority. If you don't have a place to live, you'd better not be wasting your cash on a massive bash. That's irresponsible and says terrible things about your suitability as a spouse.", "I donated my wedding dress to an organization that provides formal wear to people who aren't well off. They were delighted to get a dress that was a few months old rather than 25 years out of date!", "How else can she get divorced by 26?", "She *must* be married by 25\u2026and divorced by 27, I suppose?  People who worry more about the wedding than the actual marriage are starting out at a disadvantage.", "I got married on the beach on the OBX in a beautiful sundress I picked up last minute that day as we woke up on vacation and were like, let's get married today, lol. Oh, I i was 41, and we had 2 kids already.  Nothing ever goes perfectly according to plan.", "Mine was also a prom dress! Just as beautiful and way cheaper!!", "Yes, and we have the crystal band from my veil. She\u2019s only 21 so I think it will be a few more years.", "That\u2019s absolutely adorable!! All the guys (and gals) in here, take notes!", "She's gotta leave time for the divorce, followed by the panicked hunt for husband number 2 so she can still squeeze a couple of kids into the timeline.", "That's about how much my dress cost, and it was the prettiest one I saw.", "My dress was a custom rental. Someday I\u2019d like to go back to the store and buy it. I can only hope she still has it in storage somewhere\u2026", "It is OP's place now because JNSIL basically wanted the money or the dress from OP. Once JNSIL decided to do that, OP was perfectly justified in providing her opinion. I borrower money from my father exactly once. It was an emergency, I was desperate, and he was nearby. I didn't say \"Dad, loan me money or buy me a new car!\" I asked kindly, told him what the emergency was, and he loaned it to me. This chick doesn't even want a loan, because the dress will be destroyed after alterations. And if OP takes her shopping, JNSIL will want her to buy the dress and won't want anything reasonably priced.\n\nPart of being an adult is paying your own way. If they want to get married they have two choices unless people WANT to help out: They can have a wedding with the resources they have and do stuff like a wedding pot luck, or they can work and save until they have enough for the wedding of their dreams like what most people do.", "But the other person kept going on and wouldn\u2019t except no.  Why is that ok, but the other isn\u2019t?", "NTA I got my dress from Ross and our wedding rings at a discount, I paid $70. for them total and we grabbed a bouquet of roses on the way to the court house.", "I actually bought a Vera Wang wedding gown at Goodwill to wear to a costume party (I wore big fake teeth and carried a wand - I was the Tooth Fairy!). It was a ballgown with a gorgeous pink satin bodice and huge organza skirt, probably only a few seasons old, perfect condition, spotlessly clean, and $45."]}
