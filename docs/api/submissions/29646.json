For a long time we thought it could work out and I would just be the super pregnant maid of honor, I even bought a different dress about two weeks before the wedding because I couldn't fit into mine. My doctors originally thought it was fine for me to go (it was a 4 hour drive in a different state and my husband and I were going to stay the night at a hotel) but about a week before the wedding at a checkup my doctor said she didn't recommend I travel at all as she thought the baby might be early. Well both my best friend and myself were really bummed out but she understood and made one of her other good friends the MOH. My baby ended up being 2 weeks late so I could have actually gone. The thing is unless you move the wedding by a at least a month in either direction your friend may not be able to come, even then she may not. Her baby may be early or late. She may require bed rest, she may need extra time to recover after the birth, you just don't know. Your wedding date is pretty set it seems and it would be hard to change everything. It's up to you and your fianc\u00e9 but I wouldn\u2019t change it.", "NTA \nI think your friend doesn\u2019t understand\u2026\nMove it one week or two? Baby comes whenever they want on full term between 37/38 up to 42 weeks. That\u2019s a month. Add another week (if everything goes SPLENDID and she is a pro with breastfeeding and baby is quiet n nice)\nat home to recoup. Then add the childcare, not many are ok to watch a newborn. Could be a nurse or a family member but it\u2019s not like you find a sitter for such a young infant like in a jiffy. I am not even going down the \u2018she ll be so tired that if someone is watching the baby she\u2019ll probably just want to sleep\u2019", "NTA. She certainly won\u2019t be able to attend a week or 2 after having the baby, and week or 2 before babies can come early and she could not be feeling well struggling with the pregnancy and not able to attend anyway there\u2019s no way to know. So no don\u2019t move the date.", "NTA. The date is special to you and your fiance. Do not move the wedding, in all likelihood she wouldn\u2019t be able to attend a few weeks before or after either. Not to mention the non refundable money you\u2019ll lose.\n\nIt\u2019s just shitty timing, but you\u2019re not the asshole.", "NTA.  These things happen and people miss weddings. Your wedding is planned and scheduled and guests have been saving a date for you.  \n\nChanging the date by a few weeks will not ensure she can come to your wedding.  If this is her first child she could easily have this baby 2 weeks early or two weeks late.  She could have a perfectly healthy pregnancy and still have that baby 6 weeks early.  At this point in her pregnancy, she cannot predict what her restrictions might be during her pregnancy and she has no idea what her recovery time or her child's medical needs might be.  Aside from scheduling the wedding for 3 months sooner or 3 months later, changing it by a few days will not do much to improve her odds of attendance.", "Due dates are *approximate*. You can shift your wedding date by a couple of weeks and your friend could still reasonably give birth on that day. \n\nUnless she wants to schedule a C section, you can\u2019t put a birth date on the calendar.\n\nHave your wedding as scheduled. If your friend is there in person, or on a zoom call or something, you said changing the date would be a logistical nightmare.  \n\nNTA and what you decide to do should not be up for a committee vote.", "NTA. You can't just move the date of your wedding, for crying out loud! It was totally inappropriate of her to even ask you that. Tell her that you're sorry but contracts have been signed, deposits have been paid and changing is just not feasible.\n\nLet her know you're happy for her and you're so excited to meet her baby and while you'll miss her so much at your wedding, you're hoping she can at least join by zoom or something and if not, you'll make sure it's recorded for her.", "NTA how in the world does your friend think changing the date is a solution? If anything, she\u2019s going to be more able to attend before the birth than after. I stood for my friend 6 month PP and it was awful! My breast milk leaked, my body felt squeezed and uncomfortable in my dress. I had to completely undress to feed my baby and the entire time I was at the reception I was worrying about my child. \n\nThere\u2019s no way I\u2019d bring a newborn into a crowd of wedding guests, who will want to touch and breathe on the baby, and whom would .i possibly feel comfortable leaving him/her with? Your friend is upset for no reason.\n\nETA: is your friend aware that she will be bleeding for weeks after the birth? That if she has a C-section she won\u2019t be able to drive or even sit upright for long periods? It\u2019s an unfortunate scheduling difficulty, and she should focus on her health.", "NTA. \n\nBabies don't come on schedule. Many are early or late. Also, the date is special to you and your partner so why change it. \n\nPeople miss weddings for all sorts of reasons. You would of course want her there but it's coincidental that her baby's ETA is that week. You changing it a week earlier or later might still end up being her due date. It's unreasonable to ask people to change their lives around for her and her upcoming bundle of joy.", "NTA\n\nWhen you move it, it will be wrong for someone else.", "I wouldn't change your date, especially considering all the preparations. Even though your date coincides with her expected due date, she could go earlier or later.

On top of that, she may very well be unable to attend even if you do move the date.\n\nRegardless, there's no sense in moving the date, even if it weren't a special day for you.", "It's highly unlikely that your friend would be able to attend the wedding just a few weeks before or after giving birth anyway.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You will find in life that there are times people can't be there for everything.  This is potentially one of them - although baby due dates are notoriously unpredictable and Jane may still make it.\n\nTell her you understand, but it would be too costly and logistically difficult to change your wedding date.  You love her and you'll look forward to celebrating with her and her baby if she can't make it.", "she going to pay for the change? nta", "NTA. The date of your party is important to you, so have your party on that date. Her vanity project is important to her but that doesn't mean you should change your party.", "Nta. While it would be nice to be able to easily change the date of your wedding\u2026it won\u2019t be easy or cheap. You will lose deposits on everything. You may have to find an entirely new venue or caterer, florist, etc. On top of that you could change it to 4 weeks sooner and your best friend could get put on bed rest or have the baby early. You could move it 3 weeks out and baby comes 2 weeks late so mom isn\u2019t well enough to travel. It\u2019s sad she will miss but I\u2019m sure she will understand.", "NTA - it\u2019s entitled to even attempt to ask. There\u2019s no guarantee that she\u2019ll still be able to make it even if you *did* move it. What if the baby is early or late? What if she has the baby before and there\u2019s complications? Or she doesn\u2019t want to leave the baby/bring newborn to wedding?", "Nta - babies are too unpredictable to change a wedding date on. It could come early. Or late. It could be an easy birth. Or not. Tell her you'll have a livestream for her.", "NTA. Has she ever planned a wedding? You can\u2019t just change the date. Most likely the venue is booked, and probably several other vendors. Sometimes life gets in the way of our plans. No one is at fault but she is not thinking clearly.", "Unfortunate coincidence, but not your fault.", "NTA. She\u2019s due the week of, unless she\u2019s having a planned c-section she has no guarantee she\u2019ll deliver then. And even if it is a planned delivery, there\u2019s no guarantee the baby won\u2019t decide to come early. Even if it were an easy thing to move by a week she could still end up in labor. Trying to reschedule this close might not even be possible with some of all of your vendors. \n\nWould you rather have your friend at your wedding and miserable and stressing about going in to labor? Or would you rather enjoy the day knowing she was home, comfortable, and waiting for her own big day? Arrange for a live stream for her. You are both having major life changing events that are happening at the same time because life sometimes throws you a curve. It happens.", "NTA... once you do save the dates, there's no going back. It's upsetting one friend vs upsetting tons of people who may have already started making plans. Don't change the date. Babies are unpredictable anyway. Stuff happens. You could waste a bunch of money changing it, only for her still not to be able to go.", "NAH, I would just give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she didn't know that you guys already had most of it planned and paid for and was just hoping you would still be able to move it so she could be there. So you're not AH for not being able to accommodate, and she isn't an AH for asking.", "NTA. She's unreasonable to ask for that.", "NAH between you and your friend. Your friend just asked because she wants to be there for your day. Since you have things booked, that's probably not possible. Jane being upset doesn't mean she's upset at you - sometimes people are upset about circumstances and no one is in the wrong.\n\nYour family who are calling your insensitive are TA here.", "It\u2019s a shame the timing overlaps but moving a wedding date is a huge deal. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad about keeping your date", "NTA. Even if you move it by a week or two she might still not be able to make it. Only 5% of babies are born on their actual due date so it would be impossible to know whether she\u2019ll be able to be there or not. If she\u2019s willing, suggest a pamper weekend for you both before she hits month 8!", "With a first baby the due date is more of a guideline.  You could go through the logistics nightmare and expense of moving the wedding only to see her go into labor on your alternate date. \n\nLife happens.  Hopefully she'll be able to be with you for at least some part of the day.  Maybe you can loop her in via zoom or facetime to make her feel included.  My niece ended up with a similar situation and had two of her younger sisters take turns circulating the ipad so her friend could participate via Facetime and arranged with her caterer to deliver two meals to the mom and dad at the hospital.", "NTA. Your friend (understandably) has no idea what she\u2019s in for. There is no way to predict when the baby will come. Even scheduled c-sections have to be rescheduled. It would need to be rescheduled AT LEAST a month in either direction, and she still may not be able to go. If she has a difficult birth, she may not be able to travel for a long time. And new mom breastfeeding is a whole other layer of difficulty. I had to feed mine every 1.5-2 hours for the first 2 weeks. You can\u2019t leave the house in that case. \n\nI was supposed to attend a wedding 3 weeks before my due date. Guess what I was doing on the wedding day.  Having a very difficult, traumatic early birth. \n\nTell your friend that you are happy for the baby, but unfortunately, due to the MANY reasons (that redditors) have listed. The pregnancy means that she\u2019ll have to miss the wedding. It doesn\u2019t matter what she wants. She needs to look at the reality of the situation.", "NTA. Her being your best friend would have known, at least with in a week or two maybe not an exact date, when your wedding would be. She made a conscious decision to place herself in a position to possibly conceive a child. She knew your plans and she made her choices. Now she has to deal with those choices.", "Nta lmao, no.  If you change it to later, when?  A week or 2?  She will probably still be *bleeding* and feeling like crap if she had a natural birth, and if she had a c section, the recovery takes even longer!  She'll have a newborn, then a baby, then a toddler. \n\nThis is your wedding, not hers.  It's bad timing, but if she can't come, she can't come.", "NTA. \n\nThe timing sucks in terms of both events taking place during the same time frame. But, hey. That's life. \n\nYou chose your wedding date for a reason.  Stick with it.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks if she misses it, but hey ho.", "NTA - there is no way to know when she will deliver.\nHopefully she can make it in person, otherwise, do Phoebe from Friends and have her join via FaceTime.", "NTA\n\nThe wedding date was set before Jane became pregnant. Also, sentimentality aside, there are a lot of logistical and financial hurdles related to rescheduling a wedding. The people calling you insensitive aren't thinking logically. \n\nJane might have to miss out. It is what it is.", "NTA \nShe might not be able to attend the wedding no matter when the baby comes , postpartum and handling a new born comes withs it own challenges and your friend can\u2019t guarantee her presence no matter how hard she tries \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t change your date", "NTA, and do not change your already-planned and probably already paid for wedding! \n\nUnless your friend is having a planned C-section or induction, there is absolutely NO guarantee the baby will arrive on the due date. Even is the birth is planned. With my first, I was due on the 9th of the month; baby was born on 20th. Second child was due on 25th of one month, born on the 10th of the following month.", "One of my best friends had to have surgery the day before my wedding. We were both sad she couldn't be there. We messaged a few times through the day, I sent her pics no one else saw, so we both still felt like she was part of the day. These things happen in life; neither of you can stop your big life events for the other one. The strength of your friendship is in how well you can each still include the other, if only in your hearts.", "NTA. planning weddings are logistical nightmares already. your family members criticizing you are either dumb or ignorant. it didn't hurt for her to ask, and it's fine for you to say no. \n\nbut try to put yourself in her shoes and think about what would make you happy given the circumstances if you were in her position. maybe it'll make you think of something that might prevent hurt feelings (special shoutout at your wedding or a night out pre-wedding/baby).", "info: Have you already started in inviting people/selecting vendors/venues and making deposits? It may be entirely impractical to change your date, and if you've already sent out invites, it's pretty unfair to your other guests.", "> A few family members have told me I'm being insensitive\n\nYou're not. They're being clueless and/or selfish.\n\n> while others say it's my day and I should stick to what makes us happy\n\nThat's also wrong.  A wedding is a family and community affair and everybody should be considered.  You don't want to start off a marriage by making a bunch of people mad at you.\n\nThere is no harm in her asking.  Maybe it could have worked, but once you send out the notices of the date then it becomes a problem for a lot of people to change the date.\n\nBesides, babies don't have calendars and are notoriously bad at keeping appointments.  They've been known to show up a couple of weeks early or a couple of weeks late.  Everything might just work out.\n\nNTA", "NAH. Sounds like you are both trying, but some bad luck made this issue. How fixed are the plans? Would it be an actual nightmare to change the date? \nAnyway you are perfectly entitled to stick with your date and see your friend afterwards. But if you could change things relatively easily, then why not? On the other hand if it's too much on top of the whole wedding, don't feel bad.

Moving a wedding date is a HUGE undertaking.  Moving it a few weeks only is nearly impossible.  This is not a dinner date with friends.   \n It's a wedding.  That requires a location, an officiant, meal planning and prep, flowers and decorations, and other incidentals.  Not only that, but all of your invited guests who have booked time off for this are also going to be inconvenienced and likely not able to make your next date.  \n\nPersonally,  unless someone is dying and may not make an event and their presence is important to me I wouldn't even try.  Sometimes life just happens.\n\nI will chalk your friend even being insensitive enough to ask this of you up to hormones and love for you mixing in a rather unique manner and call this NAH.", "NTA.

Whether that bee planning vacation days, PTO requests, or even their own milestones events like weddings, showers, or graduation parties? By changing the date instead of having one person in your not attending you will likely have many. \n\nYou are also are making a big assumption that the baby will come on time and have no health problems that require a hospital stay. Add to that     you are both assuming a few weeks after birth she is even going to want to attend an all day event and leave her new born baby. Or even if she is willing to leave the baby with someone she trust, she herself will feel up to attending the wedding at all. If she does I can guarantee she will not be up to staying for most stuff outside of the ceremony itself. \n\nFor goddess sake keep your date as is.", "Good God NTA.\n\nIt's incredibly selfish of the friend to even ask and put you in this situation. It's unfortunate that she won't be able to make it, but if you're marrying the right person her absence will have little impact on your special day. (It's not about her.)

Most likely you wouldn\u2019t spend that much time with your friend because you are also having to give attention to all the family involved, all the guests, and all the business/activities surrounding the wedding.

Many women barely leave the house for a month while they recover.\n\nEditted to add - I found out recently my due date changed by a month (early life saving c-section) AFTER a month of bed rest in the hospital. Two months of my calendar being turned completely upside down. And she wants you to move your date by a week?", "NTA. She is for being upset. It sucks but as most people said the due date is just a guestimate.l and moving it a few weeks probably won't matter. Plus will she even want to attend a wedding with a new born? Probably not.

I understand wanting your best friend there and how disappointing it is to think she might not make it.  But it\u2019s hard to set a date that works for everyone.

Why? Because I had a drinking problem and would ditch her to go get drunk. It's not the same thing obviously but in the end I cried (but not to her) and told her to have a beautiful day. Later down the line when I had gotten my shit together, was away from booze, and she was already married I told her it hurt but it was perfectly understandable why she couldn't have me in her party.

She likely won't have the time or the energy to attend even if you move things by a week or two in either direction.\n\nGently tell Jane that while you love her and wish she could attend, it just isn't logistically possible to move your date. You want her to focus on having a safe delivery and a healthy baby, and you look forward to sharing photos/video with her, and will have someone bring her cake, etc. \n\nShe will take that however she takes it, but it's not on you to lose money/nevies/etc over this.", "NTA but your best friend is. Change the date and probably inconvenience many people and cost yourselves money? \nCan someone be a guestzilla?", "Just because they give you a due date doesn't mean that's when you have the baby.  You can be a week or 2 early or a couple weeks late.  After 2 weeks late they usual induce you.  She has no clue when that baby is coming . If changing the date for you would be that big of a problem then don't do it.", "NTA. Asking you to change a date that you've already booked is unreasonable. Not sure why she'd even ask you that.

Her asking you to change the date is just as asinine as it would have been for you to ban her from getting pregnant before your wedding.

You\u2018re looking at a window of about six weeks during which a baby carried to term might be born. Moving the date by a week might amount to absolutely nothing in the end.", "NTA\n\nThat was a huge ask.  That would be a logistical nightmare and I would be surprised if it were even possible.

However, given where you are in the process , you are correct that changing your date would be a logistical nightmare. I get where Jane is coming from, but this is a really huge ask from her.

We've put a lot of thought nothing to it and it wouldn't be right to change something that means a lot to you you have every right to enjoy and have your special day. You've been planning this longer than she's been pregnant and I know it sounds kind of mean but nobody should have to give up their special days. In my opinion you can try work around it make it more comfortable, but I wouldn't move the day if it's means a lot to you and your fianc\u00e9 you have to be gentle and just say I wish I could but this day means a lot to me and my fianc\u00e9 and I'm sorry but I can't change it. I wish I could but it gets expensive to do that when you've already started investigating it and it's kind of selfish in a way to ask somebody to give up their special day due to their own circumstances not that it's a bad thing it's just a messed up situation to begin with.

The time when even a very close friend could make a very gentle request to reschedule is long past. It was completely inappropriate for her to ask. You seem not to mind her asking, and I'll allow that she may be hormonal, just now realising that she might miss the wedding and not thinking straight, so maybe this is a NAH situation.\n\nIf you are still feeling bad, keep this in mind. You wouldn't have to squint too hard to see that she deliberately got pregnant at a time which meant that she would miss your wedding. However you understand that everyone has the right to choose the time for major milestones in their lives, and that for a person who has had trouble getting pregnant, stopping trying for maybe two full months to avoid missing your wedding was an undue hardship. Since you understand that for your friend, trust that she will understand that asking you to delay your wedding was an undue hardship.\n\nI still think she was a crappy friend for asking, but that's okay, she's not my friend.

Asking once doesn't make her an ahole, but it really is too big of an ask. I also think it's premature for her to get sad about not changing the date - she still doesn't actually know how close the wedding date and birth date will be.

Her fianc\u00e9 has a say in his own wedding, as well.\n\nLord.", "If the date is moved early and the friend develops pre-eclampsia, my understanding is that she goes in to the hospital as early as 20 weeks to get diagnosed, and comes out when she's delivered the baby. Wedding be dammed. \n\nMove the date later and there may be issues with the newborn that require constant medical attention. Again, wedding be damned.\n\nMaybe she could set up a fall back option of a livestream? If she can't make it due to baby, she can still attend virtually? \n\nIt totally sucks that her friend possibly can't be there in person, but spending thousands of dollars to change to a date that is still not even certain?", "He's a little over 1 year old now and he's doing great. :)", "Lol omg. It was like those babies knew Grandpa was coming and were like \u201cgotta beat him! Gotta beat him!\u201d", "Car babies!", "Yup, unless it\u2019s an emergency, such as the baby have prolonged late decels or a placenta abruption or something. If the baby is otherwise healthy, they have no problem bumping that c-section until it\u2019s more preferable for the team.", "I had a scheduled c-section for my last and my daughter decided to break my water and come days before that date.", "Right?! Like, the audacity! \n\n\u201cHey BFF, I know you managed to get your dream venue on a date that is significant to you, put deposits down, secured vendors for that date, and already sent save the dates out to everyone invited, but would be possible to change it up? I mean, it\u2019s only been a year of planning, another date won\u2019t be as significant, there\u2019s a good chance the venue and other vendors won\u2019t even be available, you\u2019ll have to pay for more save-the-dates, and possibly eat the costs of deposits you have already made, but that\u2019s cool, right? Just change it so I\u2019ll either be too pregnant to enjoy the evening, in labor, or freshly postpartum and not up for going anyway.\u201d", "I disagree. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask. It would be unreasonable to expect.", "Just sounds like she wants to be at her friend's wedding to me, and is hoping to make it work.", "The way I read it was more like friend asked if it would make sense and/or be logistically possible for Opie to change the date, like less of a true ask and more just letting Opie know that their dates conflict, and checking in to see if a reasonably simple solution even exists. Sometimes people either don\u2019t have any plans that involve reservations and down payments, and some people don\u2019t have their wedding planned out far enough this far ahead of time for those things to be in place yet. Ofc the majority of couples won\u2019t fall into either category, and for that majority, changing a wedding date at this stage isn\u2019t feasible. But, since we have no idea how involved the friend is in planning the wedding, she might have honestly just been trying to find out. Plus, I know for some people having their best friend at their wedding IS important enough to change a date for! And that\u2019s not like me trying to throw shade at Opie in some \u201cshe doesn\u2019t care enough to change the date\u201d type of way or whatever, I\u2019m saying that friend could\u2019ve also been kinda checking in to see if Opie WOULD want to change the date, so that there\u2019d be enough time to do so should that decision be made. \n\nAll that said, I could be totally misjudging the vibe of how the friend asked, and if she genuinely did ask for the date to be changed in a serious way, that\u2019s not reasonable. Like if it was ANY more \u201cpressure\u201d (for lack of better term) than \u2018hey this is my due date, i understand it conflicts w your wedding. I\u2019d still love to come to your wedding if changing the date is something you WANT to do. I\u2019m not sure how far along in the planning you are, so I don\u2019t know how feasible that would be for you and I\u2019m not asking you to change the date, but I figured I\u2019d bring up the idea just in case.\u2019", "Livestreaming is a good idea, that way the friend can at least witness it even if she isn't in person.", "Yep literally happened to me, baby due on 31st Oct (last year) then almost 2wks later born on her daddy's birthday lol", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "OP has signed contracts, sent save the dates, and invites. It is absolutely unreasonable to ask her to change the date.", "It's not unreasonable to ask. She just wants to be there and is trying to make it work. It's not unreasonable to say no either.", "Yes, it is. Breaking a venue contract would likely cost OP a lot of money. I'd never ask a friend to do that just because I'm having a kid.", "It is unreasonable (especially after contracts are signed!) because a rescheduling is deeply unlikely.", "So? Maybe the friend would be happy to cover that cost. Asking is fine. Expecting is not.", "I simply disagree. Asking is not unreasonable."]}
