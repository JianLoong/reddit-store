For a long time we thought it could work out and I would just be the super pregnant maid of honor, I even bought a different dress about two weeks before the wedding because I couldn't fit into mine. My doctors originally thought it was fine for me to go (it was a 4 hour drive in a different state and my husband and I were going to stay the night at a hotel) but about a week before the wedding at a checkup my doctor said she didn't recommend I travel at all as she thought the baby might be early. Well both my best friend and myself were really bummed out but she understood and made one of her other good friends the MOH. My baby ended up being 2 weeks late so I could have actually gone. The thing is unless you move the wedding by a at least a month in either direction your friend may not be able to come, even then she may not. Her baby may be early or late. She may require bed rest, she may need extra time to recover after the birth, you just don't know. Your wedding date is pretty set it seems and it would be hard to change everything. It's up to you and your fianc\u00e9 but I wouldn\u2019t change it.", "NTA \nI think your friend doesn\u2019t understand\u2026\nMove it one week or two? Baby comes whenever they want on full term between 37/38 up to 42 weeks. That\u2019s a month. Add another week (if everything goes SPLENDID and she is a pro with breastfeeding and baby is quiet n nice)\nat home to recoup. Then add the childcare, not many are ok to watch a newborn. Could be a nurse or a family member but it\u2019s not like you find a sitter for such a young infant like in a jiffy. I am not even going down the \u2018she ll be so tired that if someone is watching the baby she\u2019ll probably just want to sleep\u2019", "NTA. She certainly won\u2019t be able to attend a week or 2 after having the baby, and week or 2 before babies can come early and she could not be feeling well struggling with the pregnancy and not able to attend anyway there\u2019s no way to know. So no don\u2019t move the date.", "NTA. The date is special to you and your fiance. Do not move the wedding, in all likelihood she wouldn\u2019t be able to attend a few weeks before or after either. Not to mention the non refundable money you\u2019ll lose.\n\nIt\u2019s just shitty timing, but you\u2019re not the asshole.", "NTA.  These things happen and people miss weddings. Your wedding is planned and scheduled and guests have been saving a date for you.  \n\nChanging the date by a few weeks will not ensure she can come to your wedding.  If this is her first child she could easily have this baby 2 weeks early or two weeks late.  She could have a perfectly healthy pregnancy and still have that baby 6 weeks early.  At this point in her pregnancy, she cannot predict what her restrictions might be during her pregnancy and she has no idea what her recovery time or her child's medical needs might be.  Aside from scheduling the wedding for 3 months sooner or 3 months later, changing it by a few days will not do much to improve her odds of attendance.", "Due dates are *approximate*. You can shift your wedding date by a couple of weeks and your friend could still reasonably give birth on that day. \n\nUnless she wants to schedule a C section, you can\u2019t put a birth date on the calendar.\n\nHave your wedding as scheduled. If your friend is there in person, or on a zoom call or something, you said changing the date would be a logistical nightmare.  \n\nNTA and what you decide to do should not be up for a committee vote.", "NTA. You can't just move the date of your wedding, for crying out loud! It was totally inappropriate of her to even ask you that. Tell her that you're sorry but contracts have been signed, deposits have been paid and changing is just not feasible.\n\nLet her know you're happy for her and you're so excited to meet her baby and while you'll miss her so much at your wedding, you're hoping she can at least join by zoom or something and if not, you'll make sure it's recorded for her.", "NTA how in the world does your friend think changing the date is a solution? If anything, she\u2019s going to be more able to attend before the birth than after. I stood for my friend 6 month PP and it was awful! My breast milk leaked, my body felt squeezed and uncomfortable in my dress. I had to completely undress to feed my baby and the entire time I was at the reception I was worrying about my child. \n\nThere\u2019s no way I\u2019d bring a newborn into a crowd of wedding guests, who will want to touch and breathe on the baby, and whom would .i possibly feel comfortable leaving him/her with? Your friend is upset for no reason.\n\nETA: is your friend aware that she will be bleeding for weeks after the birth? That if she has a C-section she won\u2019t be able to drive or even sit upright for long periods? It\u2019s an unfortunate scheduling difficulty, and she should focus on her health.", "NTA. \n\nBabies don't come on schedule. Many people are early or late. Also, the date is special to you and your partner so why change it. \n\nPeople miss weddings for all sorts of reasons. You would of course want her there but it's coincidental that her baby's ETA is that week. You changing it a week earlier or later might still end up being her due date. It's unreasonable to ask people to change their lives around for her and her upcoming bundle of joy.", "NTA\n\nWhen you move it, it will be wrong for someone else.", "I wouldn't change your date, especially considering all the preparations. Even though your date coincides with her expected due date, she could go earlier or later.

On top of that, she may very well be unable to attend even if you do move the date.\n\nRegardless, there's no sense in moving the date, even if it weren't a special day for you.", "It's highly unlikely that your friend would be able to attend the wedding just a few weeks before or after giving birth anyway.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You will find in life that there are times people can't be there for everything.  This is potentially one of them - although baby due dates are notoriously unpredictable and Jane may still make it.\n\nTell her you understand, but it would be too costly and logistically difficult to change your wedding date.  You love her and you'll look forward to celebrating with her and her baby if she can't make it.", "she going to pay for the change? nta", "NTA. The date of your party is important to you, so have your party on that date. Her vanity project is important to her but that doesn't mean you should change your party.", "Nta. While it would be nice to be able to easily change the date of your wedding\u2026it won\u2019t be easy or cheap. You will lose deposits on everything. You may have to find an entirely new venue or caterer, florist, etc. On top of that you could change it to 4 weeks sooner and your best friend could get put on bed rest or have the baby early. You could move it 3 weeks out and baby comes 2 weeks late so mom isn\u2019t well enough to travel. It\u2019s sad she will miss but I\u2019m sure she will understand.", "NTA - it\u2019s entitled to even attempt to ask. There\u2019s no guarantee that she\u2019ll still be able to make it even if you *did* move it. What if the baby is early or late? What if she has the baby before and there\u2019s complications? Or she doesn\u2019t want to leave the baby/bring newborn to wedding?", "Nta - babies are too unpredictable to change a wedding date on. It could come early. Or late. It could be an easy birth. Or not. Tell her you'll have a livestream for her.", "NTA. Has she ever planned a wedding? You can\u2019t just change the date. Most likely the venue is booked, and probably several other vendors. Sometimes life gets in the way of our plans. No one is at fault but she is not thinking clearly.", "Unfortunate coincidence, but not your fault.", "NTA. She\u2019s due the week of, unless she\u2019s having a planned c-section she has no guarantee she\u2019ll deliver then. And even if it is a planned delivery, there\u2019s no guarantee the baby won\u2019t decide to come early. Even if it were an easy thing to move by a week she could still end up in labor. Trying to reschedule this close might not even be possible with some of all of your vendors. \n\nWould you rather have your friend at your wedding and miserable and stressing about going in to labor? Or would you rather enjoy the day knowing she was home, comfortable, and waiting for her own big day? Arrange for a live stream for her. You are both having major life changing events that are happening at the same time because life sometimes throws you a curve. It happens.", "NTA... once you do save the dates, there's no going back. It's upsetting one friend vs upsetting tons of people who may have already started making plans. Don't change the date. Babies are unpredictable anyway. Stuff happens. You could waste a bunch of money changing it, only for her still not to be able to go.", "NAH, I would just give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she didn't know that you guys already had most of it planned and paid for and was just hoping you would still be able to move it so she could be there. So you're not AH for not being able to accommodate, and she isn't an AH for asking.", "NTA. She's unreasonable to ask for that.", "NAH between you and your friend. Your friend just asked because she wants to be there for your day. Since you have things booked, that's probably not possible. Jane being upset doesn't mean she's upset at you - sometimes people are upset about circumstances and no one is in the wrong.\n\nYour family who are calling your insensitive are TA here.", "It\u2019s a shame the timing overlaps but moving a wedding date is a huge deal. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad about keeping your date", "NTA. Even if you move it by a week or two she might still not be able to make it. Only 5% of babies are born on their actual due date so it would be impossible to know whether she\u2019ll be able to be there or not. If she\u2019s willing, suggest a pamper weekend for you both before she hits month 8!", "With a first baby the due date is more of a guideline.  You could go through the logistics nightmare and expense of moving the wedding only to see her go into labor on your alternate date. \n\nLife happens.  Hopefully she'll be able to be with you for at least some part of the day.  Maybe you can loop her in via zoom or facetime to make her feel included.  My niece ended up with a similar situation and had two of her younger sisters take turns circulating the ipad so her friend could participate via Facetime and arranged with her caterer to deliver two meals to the mom and dad at the hospital.", "NTA. Your friend (understandably) has no idea what she\u2019s in for. There is no way to predict when the baby will come. Even scheduled c-sections have to be rescheduled. It would need to be rescheduled AT LEAST a month in either direction, and she still may not be able to go. If she has a difficult birth, she may not be able to travel for a long time. And new mom breastfeeding is a whole other layer of difficulty. I had to feed mine every 1.5-2 hours for the first 2 weeks. You can\u2019t leave the house in that case. \n\nI was supposed to attend a wedding 3 weeks before my due date. Guess what I was doing on the wedding day.  Having a very difficult, traumatic early birth. \n\nTell your friend that you are happy for the baby, but unfortunately, due to the MANY reasons (that redditors) have listed. The pregnancy means that she\u2019ll have to miss the wedding. It doesn\u2019t matter what she wants. She needs to look at the reality of the situation.", "NTA. Her being your best friend would have known, at least with in a week or two maybe not an exact date, when your wedding would be. She made a conscious decision to place herself in a position to possibly conceive a child. She knew your plans and she made her choices. Now she has to deal with those choices.", "Nta lmao, no.  If you change it to later, when?  A week or 2?  She will probably still be *bleeding* and feeling like crap if she had a natural birth, and if she had a c section, the recovery takes even longer!  She'll have a newborn, then a baby, then a toddler. \n\nThis is your wedding, not hers.  It's bad timing, but if she can't come, she can't come.", "NTA. \n\nThe timing sucks in terms of both events taking place during the same time frame. But, hey. That's life. \n\nYou chose your wedding date for a reason.  Stick with it.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks if she misses it, but hey ho.", "NTA - there is no way to know when she will deliver.\nHopefully she can make it in person, otherwise, do Phoebe from Friends and have her join via FaceTime.", "NTA\n\nThe wedding date was set before Jane became pregnant. Also, sentimentality aside, there are a lot of logistical and financial hurdles related to rescheduling a wedding. The people calling you insensitive aren't thinking logically. \n\nJane might have to miss out. It is what it is.", "NTA \nShe might not be able to attend the wedding no matter when the baby comes , postpartum and handling a new born comes withs it own challenges and your friend can\u2019t guarantee her presence no matter how hard she tries \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t change your date", "NTA, and do not change your already-planned and probably already paid for wedding! \n\nUnless your friend is having a planned C-section or induction, there is absolutely NO guarantee the baby will arrive on the due date. Even is the birth is planned. With my first, I was due on the 9th of the month; baby was born on 20th. Second child was due on 25th of one month, born on the 10th of the following month.", "One of my best friends had to have surgery the day before my wedding. We were both sad she couldn't be there. We messaged a few times through the day, I sent her pics no one else saw, so we both still felt like she was part of the day. These things happen in life; neither of you can stop your big life events for the other one. The strength of your friendship is in how well you can each still include the other, if only in your hearts.", "NTA. planning weddings are logistical nightmares already. your family members criticizing you are either dumb or ignorant. it didn't hurt for her to ask, and it's fine for you to say no. \n\nbut try to put yourself in her shoes and think about what would make you happy given the circumstances if you were in her position. maybe it'll make you think of something that might prevent hurt feelings (special shoutout at your wedding or a night out pre-wedding/baby).", "info: Have you already started in inviting people/selecting vendors/venues and making deposits? It may be entirely impractical to change your date, and if you've already sent out invites, it's pretty unfair to your other guests.", "> A few family members have told me I'm being insensitive\n\nYou're not. They're being clueless and/or selfish.\n\n> while others say it's my day and I should stick to what makes us happy\n\nThat's also wrong.  A wedding is a family and community affair and everybody should be considered.  You don't want to start off a marriage by making a bunch of people mad at you.\n\nThere is no harm in her asking.  Maybe it could have worked, but once you send out the notices of the date then it becomes a problem for a lot of people to change the date.\n\nBesides, babies don't have calendars and are notoriously bad at keeping appointments.  They've been known to show up a couple of weeks early or a couple of weeks late.  Everything might just work out.\n\nNTA", "NAH. Sounds like you are both trying, but some bad luck made this issue. How fixed are the plans? Would it be an actual nightmare to change the date? \nAnyway you are perfectly entitled to stick with your date and see your friend afterwards. But if you could change things relatively easily, then why not? On the other hand if it's too much on top of the whole wedding, don't feel bad.

I dont think she was outa line to ask based on how close your friendship is and she accepted your response and is understandably sad. And i don\u2019t think your outa line to keep your existing plans. With that said. Is there anyway to maybe stream the wedding so even if she cant be there in person she can be there virtually?", "NTA, but can't you figure out a way to live stream it for her?", "Of course you're not the asshole.  Moving a wedding date is a HUGE undertaking.  Moving it a few weeks only is nearly impossible.  This is not a dinner date with friends.   \n It's a wedding.  That requires a location, an officiant, meal planning and prep, flowers and decorations, and other incidentals.  Not only that, but all of your invited guests who have booked time off for this are also going to be inconvenienced and likely not able to make your next date.  \n\nPersonally,  unless someone is dying and may not make an event and their presence is important to me I wouldn't even try.  Sometimes life just happens.\n\nI will chalk your friend even being insensitive enough to ask this of you up to hormones and love for you mixing in a rather unique manner and call this NAH.", "NTA. How on earth would anyone think you are being insensitive? You are being practical. You have already placed deposits, book the hall, and sent out save the dates. \n\nWhat about every other guest who have already possibly made plans around this date? Whether that bee planning vacation days, PTO requests, or even their own milestones events like weddings, showers, or graduation parties? By changing the date instead of having one person in your not attending you will likely have many. \n\nYou are also are making a big assumption that the baby will come on time and have no health problems that require a hospital stay. Add to that     you are both assuming a few weeks after birth she is even going to want to attend an all day event and leave her new born baby. Or even if she is willing to leave the baby with someone she trust, she herself will feel up to attending the wedding at all. If she does I can guarantee she will not be up to staying for most stuff outside of the ceremony itself. \n\nFor goddess sake keep your date as is.", "Good God NTA.\n\nIt's incredibly selfish of the friend to even ask and put you in this situation. It's unfortunate that she won't be able to make it, but if you're marrying the right person her absence will have little impact on your special day. (It's not about her.) And as soon as that baby comes, your wedding is going to be a pretty low priority for her.", "NTA, it's way too late to change dates.", "NTA for all the reasons people have mentioned. \n\nTell her you feel so sad she won\u2019t be able to make it but that you totally understand why she won\u2019t be able to come. Then come up with a temporary plan to visit her for a weekend after the baby comes ( and she is ready for company) to spend some special BFF time together and meet the new baby. \n\nBeing a bride in wedding includes a crazy whirlwind of activity. Most likely you wouldn\u2019t spend that much time with your friend because you are also having to give attention to all the family involved, all the guests, and all the business/activities surrounding the wedding. A quiet weekend together with her and the new baby would actually give you more quality time together than at the wedding.", "Nta she\u2019s not going to shoot that baby out and start dancing. It\u2019s unrealistic to be able to plan your wedding around her giving birth unless you want to move it months out. The baby could come early or she could have a hard pregnancy and not be able to go out for a while. What if she gets PPD? Too many variables. Do a zoom link for her to virtually be there and plan a small hang after", "NTA - she\u2019s not coming to your wedding if you move it a week or two. She wants to and it\u2019s cute she thinks she\u2019ll be able to make it, but something like 95% of babies don\u2019t come on their due date. After birth she won\u2019t be allowed to drive for a bit, up to a few weeks. Let alone WANT to go anywhere. Many women barely leave the house for a month while they recover.\n\nEditted to add - I found out recently my due date changed by a month (early life saving c-section) AFTER a month of bed rest in the hospital. Two months of my calendar being turned completely upside down. And she wants you to move your date by a week?", "NTA. She is for being upset. It sucks but as most people said the due date is just a guestimate.l and moving it a few weeks probably won't matter. Plus will she even want to attend a wedding with a new born? Probably not. Don't change the date for her but obviously I would express that you're sad she might miss it but that you understand and it is what it is. You two can have plenty of other moments together", "Why would you move a wedding for one person? Regardless of who it is? Unless it's the bride or groom. No", "We had dear friends who could not come to our wedding because of new or imminent babies (two friends, quite a year!). It was sad not to have them there but we did a livestream of the ceremony for them. \n\nHonestly, changing the date would not have helped. You need a wider window than you think for a baby. I'm pregnant now and even though I already know ill need a c-section at 37 weeks, I'm not planning anything past 35. It's super unpredictable how I feel day to day.", "NTA. Only 5% of babies are born on their actual due date. About 73% of births actually happen 1-2 weeks before their due date (some of those are due to cesareans or inductions though). So moving your date by a week won\u2019t guarantee she can attend. \n\nYou can\u2019t plan your wedding around her pregnancy. If she was concerned about it clearly she should have planned her getting pregnant around your wedding! See how silly that sounds? You both have life events happening in a similar timeframe. That\u2019s how life is sometimes. You\u2019re NTA for wanting to keep your wedding on your special anniversary and keep your deposits, etc.", "NTA - But that\u2019s life - or what happens when you are busy making other plans.   \n\nYou already sent out save the date notices.  Other people may have booked their travel.", "If you are good friends, you will be in each other's lives for a very long time! There will be ups and downs and times you can get together and times that life throws curveballs. You will roll with it together. It's not even remotely reasonable to move now that you've booked your venue, sent save the dates etc. Take a deep breath and tell her how much you love her and all of the above. Due dates are a crap shoot anyway. Maybe think about doing something special for her - even FaceTiming her and having a \"toast\" together.", "NAH. She asked (even though anyone who has been part of a wedding knows that's a ridiculous ask), you said no, she accepted it. The only assholes are those who are butting in after the fact.", "NTA and you should know you\u2019re well past the point of no return. If your venue is booked it\u2019s a huge pain to move it and you won\u2019t be able to move it \u201ca week or two\u201d, unless it\u2019s a super unpopular venue I can guarantee it\u2019s books for months passed your date", " *planning our wedding for over a year now.* \n\n**Your plans were in place** before she got pregnant.  **She knew this.** \n\n*A couple of months ago, my best friend (let's call her Jane) announced she's pregnant...Jane approached me and gently asked if there's any way we could move our wedding date,*\n\nShe wants you to change a huge event, with complicated planning that is over a year in the making, for her.  Most people who find that they are pregnant and cannot make it to a wedding, are apologetic to the couple.  I've never heard of someone trying to make the couple change their wedding to suit a friend's pregnancy, when the wedding was already planned. \n\n*shifting everything would be a logistical nightmare.*\n\nWhat she's asking is that you 'set yourself on fire to keep her warm.'   It's a very selfish thing, that she's asking you.   She asking you to change EVERYTHING, a major headache, probably messing up a lot of other people and their plans, too, in addition to maybe losing deposits or suppliers or even your venue.   \n\nHer request is very out of line, and very very selfish.  She should just give her regrets, and leave it at that.  I hope she eventually realizes this, and apologizes to you for even asking this.  \n\nNTA.", "I think you make a great point by saying the baby\u2019s arrival is u predictable. You could move everything and the baby still come on your wedding day. I would leave it. Hopefully her pregnancy goes smoothly and the baby comes a day or two after the wedding.", "Similar here. My wedding and one of my best friends was about to have his 3rd. Due about a week beforehand. Got the ok to bring the new one if it worked out. Delivery was late, ended up having son 3 days before wedding, which was a 3.5hr drive away. I was very ok with them not coming. No need to stress anything over it", "Sure", "It sounds like it's Jane's first baby and that her only conflict is the delivery day. She has no idea how she'll feel or what she'll be able to do for weeks on either side of the estimated due date.", "Also\u2026. It super rare babies come out on thr actual due date by themselves. \n\nOooh, can only say FTM thinking. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Imagine how OP would feel if they went to the expense and logistical nightmare of shifting the venue, and having it conflict with someone else's plans, only to have the birth be early or late, or take more recovery, and have the best friend not be able to make it anyway. \n\nHow would everyone feel then?", "Sure", "If OP is UK you can\u2019t even schedule a C Section! I know so many people who were sent home for C Sections because there were no beds!", "Tea", "I wouldn\u2019t even get into enumerating the logistical reasons, as that usually just invites debate. OP doesn\u2019t really owe an explanation.", "I wouldn\u2019t even get into enumerating the logistical reasons, as that usually just invites debate. OP doesn\u2019t really owe an explanation.", "Yes to all of this! I also had to be in a wedding just about 6 weeks after giving birth (I was 2 weeks late and then had to have a C-section). I felt like crap and definitely did not want to be in a tight dress and heels all day while a total stranger baby sat our baby at our hotel. My boobs were painful and full of milk and leaking and it was terrible. When I went to nurse her she fell asleep after only nursing on one side so I was completely lopsided and in pain and leaking on the other side but still had to go back to the reception. It was hard.", "This is correct response. No good time before or after to accommodate her. Even if you did, she may not make it, or may be not in right frame of mind to enjoy. What will you do if she\u2019s on bed rest or needs accommodations. What will you do to accommodate her newborn? You\u2019re friend can\u2019t be there as you dreamed, but your dream wedding can go on as you envision. Keep your wedding date. Have bridal shower enough in advance that she can attend and show off her baby bump as I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll love doing and talking about. But wedding will not working to accommodate. It\u2019s your dream day, and already arranging. Enjoy you special day that\u2019s about you and your husband. Enjoy planning fun festivities", "Agreed, NAH, I don't see anything that Jane did or said that would maker her TA (maybe acting a bit too upset? Doesn't really seem that way here), and OP certainly isn't an AH for not changing a long-planned date. \n\nKind of sucks that Jane will probably miss it - could always have her call/facetime in for a bit so OP and Jane can exchange congratulations so she's still part of it.\n\nThe only people acting like AHs are those trying to butt in and make OP feel bad. Life happens, we keep rolling.", "She's not unreasonable to ask. She's unreasonable if she demanded or yelled at OP about it.", "And this is a thing that happens with kids.  Kids get sick, get cranky, and parents get exhausted.  New parents are going to miss some events.  It\u2019s important to maintain your friendships, but babies make that tough. \n\nPlus, due dates aren\u2019t set in stone.  Moving it a week isn\u2019t a guarantee.  NTA.", "My friend's daughter was 4 months early. Another was induced 3 weeks late. \n\nYou can't actually plan around a due date with any guarantee.", "Or a quick face time during the reception providing she is not delivering at that time!", "My cousin's wife unexpectedly gave birth on our wedding day so her and her husband were at the hospital instead of at the wedding. Their older (7 year old) daughter was our flower girl.We were getting married in the town they lived in so it was fine as that was her hospital, etc. I am sure they would not have traveled to come to our wedding knowing how far along in her pregnancy she would be.", "Even with delivery date only. It\u2019s an educated guess it\u2019s not specific science. Even your OBGYN will tell you pack n be ready by 37 weeks, contact hospital, get plans, cause the babe is basically baked n really for delivery from that point on. I think Jane has unrealistic expectations and accommodating her on those ridiculous 1/2 weeks will not only not help Jane but also take away the meaning of the wedding date for OP.", "Exactly. This is very possible.", "Not to mention, even if baby hasn't arrived yet, is she really going to feel up to attending a wedding at around 40 weeks pregnant?", ">Jane did or said that would maker her TA (maybe acting a bit too upset? Doesn't really seem that way here),\n\nI mean, it just said she was clearly upset, which is understandable, and I took it as she was upset with the situation and not OP. The main thing is she didn't say anything rude or was mean to OP about it, so I agree the only AHs here is everyone else who was trying to guilt OP.", "Asking someone to move their wedding date after Save the Dates have been sent out and a venue has been booked, is an unreasonable and likely costly request.", "To me, it seems pretty narcissistic to ask someone to reschedule their wedding.", "It\u2019s unreasonable to ask, cause 1 or two weeks in a pregnancy it\u2019s like nothing. Like move it 1 hour! It won\u2019t change the unpredictability that is a delivery date and pre postpartum situation. We are talking 1 or 2 months at best scenario.", "To me, it seems pretty narcissistic to ask someone to reschedule their wedding.", "I know someone whose first baby was two weeks late, and she was in no condition to travel or go to a wedding for at least another week. She had her parents staying and helping our for at least two weeks. \n\nSome people treat due dates as if they were scheduled appointments."]}
