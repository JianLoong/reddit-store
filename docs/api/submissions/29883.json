So in laws can move close but that doesn\u2019t mean they can drop in to visit, or come to see the grandchildren without an invitation.  It\u2019s a nice rule to tell husband you will not ever be entertaining in laws without husband with you. That means unless husband is coming home in middle of day to visit his parents the in laws aren\u2019t welcome.  This was rule in our family with my in laws, especially since MIL would get nasty when her son wasn\u2019t around to hear her. That\u2019s how I dealt with the issue. I did leave open in laws could help if it was in an emergency never happened.", "NTAH I was in a similar situation with annoying Inlaws except they were coming to visit for 4 to 7 days every 3 weeks for the first 6 months. You need either need to blow this up and set boundaries that everyone is aware of whether it be for interpersonal reasons or it would interfere with work too much. I am sure your mom would appreciate a day or 2 off a week from helping out with you. Little kids can be very tiring. In the end the decision is yours as to who you want at the house with you while the baby is little. When they are old enough to not need mom all the time then you might enjoy a day or 2 with the baby at MIL house.", "NTA. So she\u2019s already dictating how many days she will get and how many your mother will get?  And telling you that you will be driving your child to her house on \u201cher\u201d days?", "NTA, MIL is concerned about competing for influence, not the overall health of your growing family.  And the first baby hasn't even been born!\n\n  \"I think my husband told his mother this which sparked jealousy and she told my husband that if she moves she will have to have the same number of daycare days but I would have to drive the kids to her house.\"\n\nThat she expects you to accommodate her by driving (future kids) to her (as of yet unrealized) place is laughable.  You HAVE a plan in place with your mom.  \n\n Make sure your husband is mighty clear about this with MIL...who at this point is all talk.", "NTA, and quite the audacity, dictating who gets to watch the kids.", "Nope. NTA You and your husband need to be on the same page about this. Go to marriage therapy if needed. MIL needs to be told 1)  you guys will not be keeping score of how much time grandparents get with grandchild.2) if they move closer it does not mean she will be at your house everyday or every week 3) she and FIL will need to develop their own social network as you, husband and baby cannot be their entire social network or support. 4) you and your husband will decide who babysits and when. You are the parents and this is your child.. Good luck.", "NTA - you don\u2019t have to have anyone in your house you don\u2019t want too or around your kid.\n\nI would be clear with your husband his parents will be only welcome over when he is able to host them and for him to tell THEM that before she moves with her unrealistic expectations. Also set the expectation with your husband you\u2019re not going to host them every weekend. About\u2026 once to twice a month seems realistic. He needs to manage her and her expectations before she moves. There is no \u201cfairsies\u201d when caring for a child; it is who can you trust and feel comfortable with in your home to care for your child so you can focus on work. \n\nIt is also not your job to meet her wants just because you married a family member, it is your job to care for your baby as best you can, and that includes you not getting super stressed out. That can impact your milk supply, increase risk of PPD/PPA. Your needs, Baby\u2019s needs come before her wants every day.", "How does your husband feel about this?  Is he okay that you are telling his mom to kick rocks and its your mom that gets to do everything? If hes okay with the situation then its perfectly fine. If he thinks its unfair too then yeah maybe you are the asshole", "Considering what a hardship it is on many families to provide quality childcare at an affordable cost where I live, your problem is almost laughable. You have two women offering to provide free childcare to your new baby, two women who will both no doubt love your baby, and you\u2019re whining about it? How does your husband feel about this? What is it that your MIL does that bothers you so? Sounds like you are a bit entitled and ungrateful. Perhaps your MIL senses those qualities also.", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\nIt's hard to judge if you are being fair in not liking MIL as much, because it's not clear why she annoys you. You might be being unfair. It does come off a bit like you're not even trying to give her a chance. You like your mom better, end of story.  Or can you provide some specific reasons for this?\n\n> but I would have to drive the kids to her house. \n\nIs this her demand or you not being willing to let her be in your house while you work?\n\nWhat if your mom gets sick or just needs a break?  You're committing your mom to working as your full-time daycare when you *could* have backup.  And what about date nights you might want? What if you or your husband ended up sick or in a car crash and were recovering for a few weeks?  Your mom is just gonna have to do it all, I guess. \n\nSince you've never had an infant before I think you're underestimating how big a job this is. And you say 'kids' like you're planning on having more.  Advice from an older mom: don't burn bridges lightly on offers of help with childcare. Many parents would kill to have help and you're turning up your nose.\n\nYou don't factor in your baby's or husband's well-being at all, either.  A child would be very fortunate to have another doting pair of grandparents in their life.  You don't care how this impacts your husband either.  Maybe he likes his parents, too, and would enjoy getting to spend more time with them in their golden years and having them around in his children's lives.", "I mean\u2026 I personally don\u2019t see a problem yet? I mean yeah she probably wants to see her grandkids more than  a handful of times a year. Unless she\u2019s said that she plans on coming over every day, then yeah that\u2019s something you\u2019re going to have to deal with.\n\nI mean I had both sets of grandparents that were involved in my life. My maternal grandparents were often who we stayed with most of the time when my parents were still at work but we were done with school but that was because they were retired all ready while my paternal wasn\u2019t. \n\nObviously, no one will know how the birth is going to go, so it could be helpful having both grandmothers around. My sister had a c-section so she couldn\u2019t really move a bunch and had trouble cooking, cleaning, doing chores, and even changing the baby\u2019s diaper. And a baby is a handful, your mother might also be grateful for a break. Even if it\u2019s just one day a week. You might not want your  MIL to be in your personal space all the time, but depending on your husband\u2019s relationship with his parents, he might want them to be close with the baby as well. Just keep that in mind.", "Gee. You sound very unfair. \n\nYour husband is not going to be happy.", "YTA.\n\nYou are only hurting your own child by denying or restricting a relationship with their other grandmother. \n\nYou are not a kind person.", "Whao. I wish I have your problem. I just feel sad for the husband and the baby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did they come during your maternity leave?", "Well I am definitely concerned about his feelings! He's not going to be the one with the kids all day because he is going into the office so it feels like it should be my call. For context he never hangs out with my parents one on one so I don't feel I should necessarily have to just because people are grabby hands about grandkids but maybe that makes me an asshole haha", "I think a lot of women don\u2019t work these days because daycare is more expensive than having a double income where the wife makes less than daycare. If I am a SAHM I am certainly not wanting three cooks in the kitchen during weekdays. Maybe that\u2019s ungrateful! To me I\u2019m just protecting my peace.", "Unclear if mil understands and respect boundaries. Without that information cant call op ungrateful. For free childcare is never truly free. With mil reaction on demanding the baby be drop off is entitled.", "I get what you mean, but they're moving across country for this.  It's a big commitment for 'we tried it and it didn't work, oopsie'.", "She made the demand. The main reason I don't like her is because she decides things and thinks it is final without having a conversation. She didn't ask me if I wanted her help, she told me through my husband! \n\nTo your other point, I realize I am in a privileged position. I can see myself not working eventually to be a STAHM in which case I would need even less help but I DO want as many loving people in the baby's life as possible.", "I see why MIL\u2019s own daughter doesn\u2019t want a child. A lot of expectations involved! Why should DIL have to bare the brunt of this.", "Are y\u2019all really hanging out with your in-laws on a daily basis?

And if you hang around reddit enough you find out that there are enough MIL who get baby crazy because there little boy has a baby. But yes mine inlaws are my wife's parents. They aren't close either.", "Gonna say YTA.  Not because of anything with the mothers but because you don't seem to have a good idea of how your husband feels.  There isn't a right answer for what to do with the mothers, whatever you choose it's probably going to feel unfair to one of them.  But what you have to have is a united front with your husband and if you imply that he isn't apart of that decision because he isn't home all day then I don't feel like you're really taking his opinion into account.", "That's honestly fair of you to be annoyed about.  \n\nIf I were in your position instead of trying to ban the whole thing I'd focus on sitting down with your husband and having a talk about setting firm boundaries upfront.  Also include what happens if those boundaries aren't respected.  \n\nLike, first of all, if she wants to be treated as equal to *your* mom, she'd have to be offering the same type of help that your mom is. And she's not if she's demanding shuttle service.  Just getting a newborn dressed and in a carseat is a PITA.  I'd tell hubby 'your mom, you deal with it.  YOU can be in charge of shuttle service on her days.'\n\nWhatever happens, best wishes on your new arrival!", "He wants everyone to be happy! He is a bit of a momma's boy. I just hope that my happiness counts too. I understand a baby is exciting but I didn't think it would change the family dynamic so much.", ">but I didn't think it would change the family dynamic so much.\n\nTell me you're having your first baby without telling me...\n\nMore than anything else, this comment is why you should hold fire. You honestly sound like you don't know how parenthood, especially of very small children, is actually going to work out. I'm not convinced your own mother is necessarily going to be thrilled about it being assumed that she wants to be a permanent full-time babysitter, her idea of \"coming over to help\" may be very different to the assumptions you're making based on what you've seen your friends do."]}
