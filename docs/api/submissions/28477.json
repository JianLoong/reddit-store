From showering while they sleep to a time of day the bathroom gets more family use typically", "NTA\nTo have privacy when undressed is a very basic need. Your parents treat you as their object to control and access as they please, rather than a unique person with the right to be safe. Being intruded upon at your most vulnerable is UNSAFE. Your abusive parents don't respect your (and your siblings) basic needs for privacy, safety and comfort within your family and home. They feel powerful by deliberately violating those normal healthy boundaries, exerting their power to override the needs and right to respect of their \"property\"- their children. They are telling you that basic respect is something you have \"to earn\" by leaving their home to live apart from them.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyour parents are abusive AHs.", "Leave at 18 and don't look back. Never invite them over to your apartment/house because they will try to pull the same  crap. Tell them it's your house and you can do whatever you want in it, including not inviting them over.\n\nEveryone deserves privacy.\n\nFeel free to open any door in the house no matter what since nobody deserves privacy. I'm betting your mother wouldn't be happy to have you barge in when she's naked or having sexy time.\n\nOr you could get a door stop to put under the door. Technically it would remain unlocked but they wouldn't be able to open the door.", "NTA, go tell your teachers that your parents are both demanding access to your naked body, by threat.\n\nETA, yes they are perverts and you need to get somewhere safe", "Hell, at 8 years old a child deserves privacy in the bathroom.", "If there's a drawer near the door, close the door and then pull that drawer almost all the way out. It will keep the door from being able to swing in. You are not locking the door at that point. \n\nYour parents are weird and invasive.", "Wow ... I was just telling someone last night that I've had the same experience. It was a battle growing up when I began closing doors (including bathroom) and fought back at people entering while I was actively using the bathroom. It was an even more intense battle when I began locking the door to the bathroom. \n\nOP, I assume that because you're posting here, you already have an inkling that this is not normal. But I want to reiterate, because I'm 23 and only realized last month myself, this is NOT normal. It's most definitely a form of abuse and control, and I'm willing to bet, isn't the only issue that you struggle with at home. Take care of yourself , and remember that no one is entitled to your privacy and your body ever. NTA", "NTA. I would tell them that you will keep the door unlocked, but if any of them walk in on you naked one more time you will be telling your mandated reporters at school that your parents like to keep barging in on you naked and that you feel unsafe because of how they enjoy making you feel uncomfortable.\n\nIt takes just an ounce of consideration and a handful of seconds to find another sink. It will take days to deal with the social workers, and years of having to repair their reputation once you start telling everybody you know that they derive satisfaction from peeping on their underage children.", "NTA The day of your 18th birthday when you leave these things in the dust and move in with friends, make a point of waltzing into their bedroom while they are naked and telling them that privacy is not something they should think they deserve.

For safety reasons kids is not allowed to use the locks, but we respect his privacy and later on, when he is bigger, he will be allowed to use the locks. Both adults lock the bathroom doors when privacy is needed or guests are in the house.\n\nClosed doors mean do not enter, this is respected here on every occasion. Without exception.\n\nI think, our way to deal with doors is reasonable and will not force the need of a lock on bedrooms and locking bathrooms for privacy is in general seen as usual.", "Nta.  Agree with everyone else to move as soon as you can.  Alternatively how do you feel about leaving the door hang open and stinking out the kitchen every time you need to take a dump.

Not allowing any privacy in the bathroom is sick. Your mother insisting that the bathroom is where she had to wash her hands is ridiculous and obnoxious. Your father barging in without knocking is disturbing and disgusting.   \nI would barge into the bathroom (without knocking) every time one of your parents is in the bathroom. Maybe if they experience the intrusion often enough they will recognize the idiocy of their \"no locks\" mandate. I would also continue to defy them and lock the door.", "So it to them and see how they like it and or, state walking around inappropriately dresses or naked and see if they like it?

It took me years to realize it was covert incest."]}
