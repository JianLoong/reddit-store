It's fine and good to have an informal agreement like \"please don't sing around me it triggers my misophonia,\" but when words like \"permission\" are used, that's something else, and in your shoes I think I would find it a bit degrading and infantilizing. His inability to be around your singing is his own problem, and it is not some kind of inherent flaw in you as a \"bad singer\". He should handle his own problem like an adult.
