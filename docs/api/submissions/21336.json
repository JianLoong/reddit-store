Maybe you should speak to his boss.", "NTA and good for you.  Your former boss sounds like a royal AH and you are smart to have found a new job.  Good luck!", "NTA. What is going on with people on this thread. In my country not giving workers shifts in a situation like this is considered retaliation and the (former)employee could take legal action. Actually, even just not assigning someone anything to do is a type of harassment because then the upper ups start holding it over the worker's head like \"hey, you don't even do anything here, we can get you fired anytime\" thus causing people to stress out about the possibility of being jobless. It's a power move that sadly is very common. Not what happened here but every time I read about the kind of stuff managers and employers get away with I'm just so shocked that workers just have to suck it up.\n\nI don't think OP did anything wrong, having a job doesn't mean you have to be someone else's punching bag and endure being called a liar just for being human.

Her mom knows how much she gave her daughter so I\u2019m sure she is well aware that the money may (and this may even be the mothers hope) stretch longer than a week. Common sense is free. OP isn\u2019t abusing the \u201ccharity\u201d her Mother has provided her, that\u2019s such a weird narrative that you are getting from this situation.", "I\u2019m treating it just how my mother expected and TOLD me to treat it.
