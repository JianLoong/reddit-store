{"id": 19468, "submission_id": "1466fjw", "title": "AITA for banning my dad from my apartment while I\u2019m gone?", "selftext": "So I (23F) need to go away on a work trip for a week and have asked my younger brother (18M) to live in my place and care for my two cats. He\u2019s excited because he\u2019s always lived at my parents and it\u2019s like a dorm trial before college in the fall. \n\n\nProblem is my parents are antsy about him being there alone. Admittedly I don\u2019t live in the best area, but so long as he hangs out indoors and plays video games all week likes he\u2019s planning he\u2019ll be fine. My dad works in the same city and wants to visit him after work, bring him dinner, make sure he\u2019s ok, ect. \n\nThe problem I have with that is I literally have one house rule that my dad has failed to follow almost every time he has visited. That one rule is that my cats need to be secured in my bedroom with the door closed before the front door opens. My first cat, I\u2019ve had him for a year now, was either a stray or an outdoor cat before being surrendered to the shelter. While he loves cuddling and being around people, he also desperately wants to go outside, and even now a year later he meows at the doors and windows to be let out. Leaving the politics of outdoor cats aside, I live in a very dangerous area for a cat. On one side of my apartment is a five lane two way road, and on the other side is a four labe road, both being very busy. The back of my apartment is a busy bank. If my cat were to get out and run from being scared, it\u2019d practically be a death certificate. \n\n\nEven though I\u2019ve reminded my dad of this one rule every time he visits he always opens the front door while the cats are out. I\u2019m vigilant and catch him and remind him, but he always gets defensive and brushes it off as an accident then does it again, sometimes twice in one visit. He often tries to stand there having conversation with the door open. My parents cats have gotten out because of this but because they live in a suburb they\u2019ve always been ok. My brother is a little absent minded and gets absorbed in his video games so if my dad tries this while I\u2019m not there I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll catch it before my boy can sneak out. \n\n\nThus I\u2019ve banned my dad from my place and he\u2019s extremely angry. He keeps insisting that he won\u2019t do it again and that he doesn\u2019t want my brother there alone. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: \n\nSo I talked to my mom about this post and my worries. Particularly that due to the nature of my work I most likely wont have cell service for the majority of my trip and thus if something happened it wouldn\u2019t be easy to get to me. Also I found out today my younger kitten needs to be on medication longer when he should have been off before the trip (he\u2019s fine just needs steroid ointment and monitoring). \n\nWhen I initially brought up my trip a few months ago she was a bit reluctant to stay as it would make her drive time to work 40 minutes longer and make balancing her garden and my cats difficult, but she offered to take over after I explained my worries and said she\u2019d prefer that to my brother staying there anyways. I\u2019m helping her garden every week-end both because I enjoy it and as thanks. She definitely can be trusted to keep the boys up and my dad won\u2019t come over.\n\n\nI haven\u2019t broken the news to my brother yet, I figure he\u2019ll be pretty sad. I do have festival tickets I was going to surprise him with, so I\u2019ll tell him about it at the same time to make it up to him. I\u2019ll let him hang out for a video game weekend too sometime soon.\n\nThanks all for helping me make a decision! I do feel a bit guilty towards my brother but it\u2019s best to keep the cats safe when I\u2019m not sure if my rules will be upheld while I\u2019m gone without cell service!", "created_utc": 1686419254, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1466fjw/aita_for_banning_my_dad_from_my_apartment_while/", "score": 701, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That being said, I have meal prepped and grocery shopped for the week for him so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about cooking or anything, and I\u2019ve had him over for a few days at a time letting him take the lead, and he\u2019s done just fine.

Your dad refuses to behave in a responsible way regarding the safety of your pets, despite repeated requests on your part that he comply with a single simple rule.

He shouldn't need his Dada checking up on him every day to feed him and make sure he's still breathing.\n\nBUT. Your father seems to be the kind of guy who doesn't give a flying fig about your boundaries and cares only about being right and asserting power over you by PURPOSELY breaking them (once is a mistake, twice is forgetful, anything more than that is intentional in my opinion....).\n\nMuch as I hate to say it, with the pattern your Dad has and your brother's admitted lack of awareness/forgetfulness, I'd consider finding someone else to check in on your kitties OP :/ Kitties' safety trumps family politics ANY day...", "NTA but keep in mind that your father will absolutely pressure your brother into letting him in.

I doubt your 18 year old brother is going to be able to stand up to him.  I suggest finding a different plan if you really want to be safe. I say this as someone whose dad is the same way.
