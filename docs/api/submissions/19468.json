{"id": 19468, "submission_id": "1466fjw", "title": "AITA for banning my dad from my apartment while I\u2019m gone?", "selftext": "So I (23F) need to go away on a work trip for a week and have asked my younger brother (18M) to live in my place and care for my two cats. He\u2019s excited because he\u2019s always lived at my parents and it\u2019s like a dorm trial before college in the fall. \n\n\nProblem is my parents are antsy about him being there alone. Admittedly I don\u2019t live in the best area, but so long as he hangs out indoors and plays video games all week likes he\u2019s planning he\u2019ll be fine. My dad works in the same city and wants to visit him after work, bring him dinner, make sure he\u2019s ok, ect. \n\nThe problem I have with that is I literally have one house rule that my dad has failed to follow almost every time he has visited. That one rule is that my cats need to be secured in my bedroom with the door closed before the front door opens. My first cat, I\u2019ve had him for a year now, was either a stray or an outdoor cat before being surrendered to the shelter. While he loves cuddling and being around people, he also desperately wants to go outside, and even now a year later he meows at the doors and windows to be let out. Leaving the politics of outdoor cats aside, I live in a very dangerous area for a cat. On one side of my apartment is a five lane two way road, and on the other side is a four labe road, both being very busy. The back of my apartment is a busy bank. If my cat were to get out and run from being scared, it\u2019d practically be a death certificate. \n\n\nEven though I\u2019ve reminded my dad of this one rule every time he visits he always opens the front door while the cats are out. I\u2019m vigilant and catch him and remind him, but he always gets defensive and brushes it off as an accident then does it again, sometimes twice in one visit. He often tries to stand there having conversation with the door open. My parents cats have gotten out because of this but because they live in a suburb they\u2019ve always been ok. My brother is a little absent minded and gets absorbed in his video games so if my dad tries this while I\u2019m not there I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll catch it before my boy can sneak out. \n\n\nThus I\u2019ve banned my dad from my place and he\u2019s extremely angry. He keeps insisting that he won\u2019t do it again and that he doesn\u2019t want my brother there alone. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686419254, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1466fjw/aita_for_banning_my_dad_from_my_apartment_while/", "score": 144, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you\u2019re brother is THAT absent-minded and your dad insists on being THAT disrespectful of your wishes and boundaries **and** the whole point of having someone over is to take care of your cats, maybe you should consider asking a friend or a coworker if you can.

If dad stands outside banging on door to be let in with brother give in to dad??  You have to consider also your putting your brother in a difficult spot if dad is a strong authority figure to him.  I commend what your trying to do, but not sure your thinking of dads ability to pressure your brother to let him in to check on him.  It's sadly not as simple as you wish here I'm thinking.  Cats first!  And I'm not a cat person. Still our pets trust us to take care of them and in this case they must come first.

He does have high functioning autism, which is why everyone is so protective, but he\u2019s fully capable of taking care of himself and wants to live alone in the dorm next semester, so I think this is a great opportunity for him. That being said, I have meal prepped and grocery shopped for the week for him so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about cooking or anything, and I\u2019ve had him over for a few days at a time letting him take the lead, and he\u2019s done just fine. He\u2019s very diligent with my cats and doing what needs done.", "If my dad insists on coming over I will change who watches them, but I fully trust my brother. He\u2019s always been very strict on putting the boys up first and is the primary career for my parents cats. \ud83d\ude02 sometimes he calls me or comes over just to see the cats. He\u2019s really good with animals.\n\nEdit: my dad doesn\u2019t have a key", "Yeah, his behavior doesn't indicate any respect for your needs. \n\nHis behavior would make more sense if your request was ridiculous or completely unnecessary, which suggests...  that he thinks it's ridiculous and/or unnecessary. \n\nEither he doesn't get how much danger your cats would be in, or he doesn't care much if they're in danger.", "I somehow suspected there was more going on.", "Yeah I guess I should have put that above for more context but I didn\u2019t even think of it.  To me he\u2019s just my brother. He hangs out with his friends, we go out to music festivals together, he does all the normal kid stuff like going to school, getting into college, and doing chores. I really think he needs to be allowed some space to try new things so long as that\u2019s what he wants", "NTA\n\nYour place. Your rules.\n\nRemind your father of that.", "NTA. He needs to earn your trust back.", "NTA. Your dad refuses to behave in a responsible way regarding the safety of your pets, despite repeated requests on your part that he comply with a single simple rule. You are being a responsible pet owner by banning him. Tough luck if he doesn't like it.", "NTA. As others have said, your boundary is perfectly reasonable. Your brother is also 18 years old- he needs to learn how to handle being on his own, even in \"less than ideal\" locations. He shouldn't need his Dada checking up on him every day to feed him and make sure he's still breathing.\n\nBUT. Your father seems to be the kind of guy who doesn't give a flying fig about your boundaries and cares only about being right and asserting power over you by PURPOSELY breaking them (once is a mistake, twice is forgetful, anything more than that is intentional in my opinion....).\n\nMuch as I hate to say it, with the pattern your Dad has and your brother's admitted lack of awareness/forgetfulness, I'd consider finding someone else to check in on your kitties OP :/ Kitties' safety trumps family politics ANY day...", "NTA but keep in mind that your father will absolutely pressure your brother into letting him in. Have the talk with your brother about this beforehand.", "NTA but i would scrap the trial dorm thing and just go for a cat sitter who isn\u2019t a member of your family. with how often your dad has disrespected your boundaries, he\u2019ll definitely do it again, especially if you aren\u2019t physically there to notice and stop him.", "NTA But your dad isn\u2019t going to listen to you, he doesn\u2019t seem reasonable. I feel like you need to get someone else to house sit for you", "NTA in theory but I think it\u2019s a bit naive of you to believe he won\u2019t show up to your apartment anyways. I doubt your 18 year old brother is going to be able to stand up to him.  I suggest finding a different plan if you really want to be safe. I say this as someone whose dad is the same way. I pay more for pet sitters and ask friends before asking my family because on this front, they can\u2019t be trusted.", ">**Find another cat sitter**.\n\nYour father has no respect for you, your brother, and likely your mother.  He will do whatever he danged well pleases.\n\nIf you leave your brother in charge the cats will all be gone when you return, OP.  He won't be able to stand up to his father.\n\nIf your family has a key, OP, get it back or even better - change the locks.\n\nYWBTA if you leave your cats in danger from your relic of a father.", "Do you feel pretty confident that if your dad shows up after telling you he won\u2019t, that your brother will ignore him even as he is knocking on the door and calling? It\u2019s hard for me to imagine an 18 year old who is used to full parental supervision holding out under those circumstances but of course, you know him best."]}
