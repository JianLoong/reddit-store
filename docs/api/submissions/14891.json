No, you shouldn\u2019t have shouted at him. Speaking as a recovering addict (opiates), he was correct from a medical standpoint. Three weeks is not enough time for the drug to even exit your body (you\u2019ll be good in another week or maybe a bit longer, depending on your body). From an addiction recovery standpoint, three weeks is HUGE. It\u2019s an enormous accomplishment. It\u2019s a difficult change you\u2019ve committed to and hearing someone dismiss it is soul-crushing. I would strongly recommend finding a meeting (one positive effect of COVID is there are Zoom AA and NA meetings that you can attend pretty much any hour of the day (like I live in the states and not too long ago I needed a meeting. It was 3am here so I found a meeting on Zoom being held in London- it was great! And a reminder that A LOT of people have substance abuse problems.) NAH, your doctor should have been kinder but you also shouldn\u2019t have expected him to be a trained addiction specialist, and he was not wrong.  Best of luck with your journey, it keeps getting better!", "NAH, mainly because he\u2019s right. Having only stopped for a couple of weeks when you were a regular every day user doesn\u2019t really mean a lot, and you could benefit from addiction services. Relapse is frequent and somewhat expected and if you\u2019re not wanting to go back to using, having that resource will only help you. They can also help you work through associated anxiety. It would help you continue on with not using when things got difficult.  You\u2019re not an AH for getting upset feeling like you weren\u2019t being listened to, but just because he doesn\u2019t say what you want to hear doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t listening. You ended up losing out on a resource you could have had on top of the one you wanted.  It\u2019s really never okay to verbally abuse healthcare workers, but if you were truly in the middle of an anxiety attack, it isn\u2019t really something you can help.", "Editing because I want to open a bit more positive. You\u2019re doing great! This wasn\u2019t one of your shining moments, but that\u2019s what early sobriety **is**.  \n\nThree weeks is commendable, but is also literally the barest beginnings (speaking from personal experience).\n\nSeeing as his response made you \u201chave a panic attack\u201d lose control, and yell at him, you should seriously consider whatever resources he was recommending to you **to help you**.\n\nYou did get yourself in this position. And you took the first steps getting yourself out of it!! For the record, that\u2019s awesome and **I\u2019m proud of you** and I\u2019ve been there. But, doctors don\u2019t exist to be proud of us, they exist to provide medical help and you yelled at yours for spitting simple unpleasant facts, so YTA but **you\u2019re doing great, keep it up, and soon you won\u2019t be an asshole**.\n\nBut do stop yelling at doctors lol. Congrats on almost a month! This will be a hilarious story someday.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is right. Three weeks mean nothing.

If you look it up on Google, you'll see your own picture.  \n\nYeah, the doc was unprofessional and a little dickish. \n\nBut you deserved it.

Proud of you. \n\n\n\nHe was really dismissive of your achievement, and that sort of comment is uncalled for and unhelpful. \nWhile I don\u2019t condone shouting at doctors, hopefully it made him think twice and will stop him saying similar in the future. Glad you got the referral you needed, best of luck to you in the future", "The MD could have been more supportive.  I understand why that set you off.  Gotta give you TONS of credit for realizing your issue and doing something about it. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re seeking counseling. Wish you lotsa luck and happiness!!!", "YTA. Well done you, v but even you say you were addicted, and three weeks isn't that kind really. I'm bordering on esh, as the Dr works have explained what they could be done for you if you were (eg) clean for 3 months etc, but it's very lopsided towards you", "That's so demoralizing to say to a patient. My father's 250 days of sobriety started with the first 3 weeks. My mother's 20 years of sobriety started with the first three weeks. \n\nWhy would a physician deny a patient counseling if they recommend addiction services anyways?? A physician who is licensed in addiction medicine would recommend psychotherapy too. I can't blame you for shouting. It's really hard to advocate for yourself in the medical system. \n\nProud of you for the progress you've made NTA", "So\u2026.. gonna be unpopular I guess and say NTA. He definitely could have had better bedside manner. You stopped on your own with no help, however he needs to encourage addiction services to you, when you tell him you just stopped smoking weed and were addicted. He didn\u2019t have to be an AH about it. Most doctors would say, \u201cI\u2019m really glad to hear you haven\u2019t smoked for 21 days. Let me tell you about some support we can offer\u2026\u201d idk, it wouldn\u2019t have taken much to not be rude.", "No doctor should ever speak down to or be condescending towards someone who is asking for help. Ever. I feel bad for you ans hope you found someone who will listen. \n\nNTA. I would\u2019ve gotten upset, too. I\u2019ve been misdiagnosed so many times and not listened to, so I empathise. I once told doctors I was sure I had a ruptured disc in my spine. They didn\u2019t listen \u2014 guess what? I had a ruptured disc in my spine and required emergency surgery. To this day I have nerve damage because I was ignored for so long. Makes me hate doctors.", "I really don\u2019t understand anyone who is saying Y T A or even E S H. You are NTA. You\u2019ve accomplished a huge thing and you\u2019re taking all the steps you should be to get help. The doctor dismissed you and didn\u2019t listen to you. \nHe is right that addiction services would be helpful even though you\u2019ve stopped smoking. Addiction services are more than just drying out. It includes psychotherapy, psychiatry, social work, and a whole host of other things. BUT the onus is on him to explain his rationale and help you understand why he\u2019s making this recommendation, instead of just telling you that \u201cthree weeks is nothing\u201d. It\u2019s not nothing. It isn\u2019t everything, but he was unnecessarily dismissive of you. \nYou shouldn\u2019t have shouted at him, but you\u2019re in a vulnerable position right now and asking for help. You\u2019re doing exactly what you\u2019re supposed to do in this situation. His bedside manner is crap and he gave you a panic attack.\nDoctors go to school to become doctors, but they often neglect to develop the people skills necessary to deal with patients in an effective manner.\nI\u2019m future, is there someone you trust who you can bring to doctor\u2019s appointments with you? I find having someone impartial there who knows your situation and symptoms can be incredibly beneficial. They can help communicate and listen without becoming emotional and can help you with any response you have afterwards.", "NTA - you didnt start yelling to him right off from the start. You made your position on your relationship with weed clear as well as the type if help you wanted to seek. \n\nHe ignored this, downplayed your recovery so far, and persisted on his stance regardless of your multiple rebuttals. This constant push eventually led to your outburst.\n\nRecovery is different for each person and it can be a difficult journey. Maybe eventually you do realize you want those addiction services. Maybe you dont. Right now though, you want those recommended counseling services as you find it the best suited for your personal recovery.", "NTA. \n\nDoctors get fixated on their ideas sometimes.  \nDon't go back.", "get a second opinion.. women are often dismissed   medical profession even today", "NTA- Comments like this ARE WHY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE ADDICTED TO SHIT.

Especially a patient that is seeking help. Congratulations on your three weeks!!", "Nta, he's a dick and not a good doc. He was not listening.", "NTA for shouting at him. You are currently suffering from weed withdrawal symptoms which includes heightened anxiety. You do need a support structure but saying \"That means nothing\" completely invalidates the work you put forth. \n\nHe was an ass.", "His comment was not professional and dismissive to a great accomplishment. I can understand why you were upset but yelling at him wasn't the way to go. ESH here but him more than you.", "NTA.\n\nThe Dr was . not . listening  . to . you. He was completely dismissive and disrespectful. Good for you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA. going 3 weeks without a substance you have been using multiple times a day FOR YEARS, without medical support or counseling support, shows your self awareness. The weed use was making your mental health struggles worse- then when you stopped,on your own,with no support- your doctor was a patronizing a\\*\\*. Good on you for seeing you needed to stop. Good on you for seeing you needed help for what you were using weed to self medicate. I wish you the best and I hope the people your idiot doctor sent you to will really help you live your best life. Good luck and godspeed.", "NTA.  You were advocating for yourself when he was being dismissive.  Sometimes it takes strong language to make your point known.  Good on you for standing up for yourself and kicking an addiction.", "NTA. His intentions may of been good, but he went about it in an extremely unprofessional way. He shot himself in the foot, if anything. Don't let all the AA extremists saying YTA get to you.", "NTA, he was not listening to you and getting what kind of help you need.", "NTA - I had conjunctivitis; puffy red eyes, stuck together with mucus and the doctor said I just needed wash my face.

Doesn\u2019t seem like you have the control you think you do", "I\u2019m a medical provider and I was married to an alcoholic. When my ex went to rehab I got a crash course in addiction as a bonus. Your doctor may not have gone about it the right way but in the end he\u2019s not wrong. Pretty much all addicts self medicate. And the substance is only a small part of the problem. It\u2019s the underlying mental health issues and lack of healthy coping skills that are the bigger part of the problem. And 3 weeks is a good start but it\u2019s a drop in the bucket. My now ex was sober for 13 months but didn\u2019t get any help and was white knuckling it. It was almost as miserable to be around him sober as it was when he was drinking.  \nAs medical providers we have an obligation to help people and that includes addressing things that may not be pleasant but doesn\u2019t make them any less important. Weight is a big one and addiction is another. \n\nI understand you went there for a referral to a therapist (which most people can do that without a therapist\u2026 go to [psychology today](https://www.psychologytoday.com) to search for one) but your anxiety is both the cause and the result of your addiction so addiction did need to be addressed as well. I deal with a lot of substance abusers and very few of them want to hear that they have a problem. That still doesn\u2019t mean we should just not talk about it. To kick addiction you need therapy as well as see a shrink. And you need to continue to do that for a long time. Addiction is forever even if you get clean. There is always a chance for relapse. This mean you should continue to stay on top/ahead of your addiction by continuing mental health services to a certain degree for a long time. You don\u2019t just recover from addiction by quitting the substance. You need to address the underlying issues. I admit I really didn\u2019t know much about addiction and many medical providers are not that well versed in addiction other than knowing people are addicts and that they should get help. The one good thing that came out of my now ex\u2019s recovery shit show is that I am now pretty well versed in addiction and it has helped enormously in my job because people feel like I actually know what I am talking about. I know addiction is hard and I don\u2019t judge but I also give it to them straight without sugar coating it.  I explain the disease process instead of just saying hire an addict and you need help. That usually goes a long way and often time something click in their mind and their addiction makes more sense if you will. Doesn\u2019t always mean they\u2019re ready to quit but they understand it better at least. Many grow up around addiction and therefore a dysfunctional household which puts them at high risk for addiction due to environment, not learning healthy coping skills and the genetic predisposition. They\u2019re still ultimately responsible for their addiction but it puts things more into perspective of why they got there.\n\nAddiction is a touchy subject. In addition to that addiction services aren\u2019t easy to come by and often not covered by insurance which makes getting the right needed treatment unavailable for many. Yelling at a medical provider is never a good idea because it doesn\u2019t get you anywhere. But you can always ask to see someone else. But do understand that sometime what you need may not be always what you want. Or sometimes what you want isn\u2019t what you need (like people wanting MRIs when not indicated or narcotics). And of course there are always both patients and medical providers that can be jerks. But rather than flying of the handle just request to see someone else.", "Er. That's sort of a which came first problem. She's acknowledged the weed was/ is a problem. She's also said the anxiety came first, then the weed to self medicate until it didn't medicate shit anymore. That would make the anxiety the underlying problem and the substance abuse the manifesting symptom. Both need help. But working on the underlying issue that led to self medicating straight into addiction is actually pretty likely to do most of the heavy lifting on resolving the substance abuse. But uh? Literally saying that the weed use began in a direct attempt to self medicate for anxiety and also saying that it eventually exacerbated said anxiety is basically the definition of acknowledging the connection between the two.", "Honestly, your comment means more shit than the 3 weeks.

I work in addiction and concurrent mental health treatment.  Counselling, mental health, and addiction treatment, are integrated in a good program, as addiction almost always co-occurs with other mental health disorders.  Understanding why you were numbing yourself with a substance to prevent your anxiety is something a counsellor would help her explore in addiction treatment along with offering support in situations that can trigger that again. I was not present, so perhaps it was not well phrased, but a doctor, should be offering the right treatment to their patient. Also, I have seen many people in treatment lack clarity on where they are at in terms of their ability to prevent relapse, because addiction is complex, hard to treat and is considered a chronic condition. In other words, understanding how to help yourself if you relapse is very important because, it is common.  People who work in addiction specialize in that, so it would help her to have counselling that integrates her mental health and addiction together.

She wasn\u2019t asking to see a orthopedic surgeon for her anxiety, she was asking for a referral to counseling. This was not an inappropriate or unreasonable request. It might not be the optimal strategy, but it\u2019s not wrong. Addiction care is reasonable to offer, but is often not covered by insurance and ultimately was not what she wanted. It\u2019s our job to offer advice, but it is NOT our job to insist on it. He recommended addiction care, she declined. He should have respected that.
