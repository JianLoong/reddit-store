No, you shouldn\u2019t have shouted at him. Speaking as a recovering addict (opiates), he was correct from a medical standpoint. Three weeks is not enough time for the drug to even exit your body (you\u2019ll be good in another week or maybe a bit longer, depending on your body). From an addiction recovery standpoint, three weeks is HUGE. It\u2019s an enormous accomplishment. It\u2019s a difficult change you\u2019ve committed to and hearing someone dismiss it is soul-crushing. I would strongly recommend finding a meeting (one positive effect of COVID is there are Zoom AA and NA meetings that you can attend pretty much any hour of the day (like I live in the states and not too long ago I needed a meeting. It was 3am here so I found a meeting on Zoom being held in London- it was great! And a reminder that A LOT of people have substance abuse problems.) NAH, your doctor should have been kinder but you also shouldn\u2019t have expected him to be a trained addiction specialist, and he was not wrong.  Best of luck with your journey, it keeps getting better!", "NAH, mainly because he\u2019s right. Having only stopped for a couple of weeks when you were a regular every day user doesn\u2019t really mean a lot, and you could benefit from addiction services. Relapse is frequent and somewhat expected and if you\u2019re not wanting to go back to using, having that resource will only help you. They can also help you work through associated anxiety. It would help you continue on with not using when things got difficult.  You\u2019re not an AH for getting upset feeling like you weren\u2019t being listened to, but just because he doesn\u2019t say what you want to hear doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t listening. You ended up losing out on a resource you could have had on top of the one you wanted.  It\u2019s really never okay to verbally abuse healthcare workers, but if you were truly in the middle of an anxiety attack, it isn\u2019t really something you can help.", ". Three weeks is commendable, but is also literally the barest beginnings (speaking from personal experience).\n\nSeeing as his response made you \u201chave a panic attack\u201d lose control, and yell at him, you should seriously consider whatever resources he was recommending to you **to help you**.\n\nYou did get yourself in this position. And you took the first steps getting yourself out of it!! For the record, that\u2019s awesome and I\u2019m proud of you and I\u2019ve been there. But, doctors don\u2019t exist to be proud of us, they exist to provide medical help and you yelled at yours for spitting simple unpleasant facts, so YTA but **you\u2019re doing great, keep it up, and soon you won\u2019t be an asshole**.\n\nBut do stop yelling at doctors lol. Congrats on almost a month! This will be a hilarious story someday.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is right. Three weeks mean nothing. YOu were an AH to shout, get a grip on your addiction and your anger issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" his reply would have absolutely triggered me into smoking again seeing as 3 weeks clean means nothing.\"c .. So you are not ready yet to take responsibility for your addiction.", "ESH.  \n\nThere's a thing called \"white-knuckling. \" It means, basically,  that you're not actively using, but you're not doing anything about the things that caused you to use in the first place. If you look it up on Google, you'll see your own picture.  \n\nYeah, the doc was unprofessional and a little dickish. \n\nBut you deserved it. Everyone in the history of forever that's had problems with substance has (angrily) denied that substance was the problem.", "NTA. \n\nFirst off, congratulations on managing to stop when you realised the impact of it. Proud of you. \n\n\n\nHe was really dismissive of your achievement, and that sort of comment is uncalled for and unhelpful. \nWhile I don\u2019t condone shouting at doctors, hopefully it made him think twice and will stop him saying similar in the future. Glad you got the referral you needed, best of luck to you in the future", "The MD could have been more supportive.  I understand why that set you off.  Gotta give you TONS of credit for realizing your issue and doing something about it. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re seeking counseling. Wish you lotsa luck and happiness!!!", "YTA. Well done you, v but even you say you were addicted, and three weeks isn't that kind really. I'm bordering on esh, as the Dr works have explained what they could be done for you if you were (eg) clean for 3 months etc, but it's very lopsided towards you", "That's so demoralizing to say to a patient. My father's 250 days of sobriety started with the first 3 weeks. My mother's 20 years of sobriety started with the first three weeks. \n\nWhy would a physician deny a patient counseling if they recommend addiction services anyways?? A physician who is licensed in addiction medicine would recommend psychotherapy too. I can't blame you for shouting. It's really hard to advocate for yourself in the medical system. \n\nProud of you for the progress you've made NTA", "So\u2026.. gonna be unpopular I guess and say NTA. He definitely could have had better bedside manner. You stopped on your own with no help, however he needs to encourage addiction services to you, when you tell him you just stopped smoking weed and were addicted. He didn\u2019t have to be an AH about it. Most doctors would say, \u201cI\u2019m really glad to hear you haven\u2019t smoked for 21 days. Let me tell you about some support we can offer\u2026\u201d idk, it wouldn\u2019t have taken much to not be rude.", "No doctor should ever speak down to or be condescending towards someone who is asking for help. Ever. I feel bad for you ans hope you found someone who will listen. \n\nNTA. I would\u2019ve gotten upset, too. I\u2019ve been misdiagnosed so many times and not listened to, so I empathise. I once told doctors I was sure I had a ruptured disc in my spine. They didn\u2019t listen \u2014 guess what? I had a ruptured disc in my spine and required emergency surgery. To this day I have nerve damage because I was ignored for so long. Makes me hate doctors.", "I really don\u2019t understand anyone who is saying Y T A or even E S H. You are NTA. You\u2019ve accomplished a huge thing and you\u2019re taking all the steps you should be to get help. The doctor dismissed you and didn\u2019t listen to you. \nHe is right that addiction services would be helpful even though you\u2019ve stopped smoking. Addiction services are more than just drying out. It includes psychotherapy, psychiatry, social work, and a whole host of other things. BUT the onus is on him to explain his rationale and help you understand why he\u2019s making this recommendation, instead of just telling you that \u201cthree weeks is nothing\u201d. It\u2019s not nothing. It isn\u2019t everything, but he was unnecessarily dismissive of you. \nYou shouldn\u2019t have shouted at him, but you\u2019re in a vulnerable position right now and asking for help. You\u2019re doing exactly what you\u2019re supposed to do in this situation. His bedside manner is crap and he gave you a panic attack.\nDoctors go to school to become doctors, but they often neglect to develop the people skills necessary to deal with patients in an effective manner.\nI\u2019m future, is there someone you trust who you can bring to doctor\u2019s appointments with you? I find having someone impartial there who knows your situation and symptoms can be incredibly beneficial. They can help communicate and listen without becoming emotional and can help you with any response you have afterwards.", "NTA - you didnt start yelling to him right off from the start. You made your position on your relationship with weed clear as well as the type if help you wanted to seek. \n\nHe ignored this, downplayed your recovery so far, and persisted on his stance regardless of your multiple rebuttals. This constant push eventually led to your outburst.\n\nRecovery is different for each person and it can be a difficult journey. Maybe eventually you do realize you want those addiction services. Maybe you dont. Right now though, you want those recommended counseling services as you find it the best suited for your personal recovery.", "NTA. \n\nDoctors get fixated on their ideas sometimes.  \nDon't go back.", "get a second opinion.. women are often dismissed   medical profession even today", "NTA- Comments like this ARE WHY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE ADDICTED TO SHIT. I love how a majority of this uneducated fucking platform got together and decided to gang up and be mad at you for doing the right thing for you. Don\u2019t listen to the Google MD in middle school, you\u2019re doing great", "NTA - While I can understand what the doctor was saying, I work in the medical field and that\u2019s just not how you talk to a patient. Especially a patient that is seeking help. Congratulations on your three weeks!!", "Nta, he's a dick and not a good doc. He was not listening.", "NTA for shouting at him. You are currently suffering from weed withdrawal symptoms which includes heightened anxiety. You do need a support structure but saying \"That means nothing\" completely invalidates the work you put forth. \n\nHe was an ass.", "His comment was not professional and dismissive to a great accomplishment. I can understand why you were upset but yelling at him wasn't the way to go. ESH here but him more than you.", "NTA.\n\nThe Dr was . not . listening  . to . you. He was completely dismissive and disrespectful. Good for you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA. going 3 weeks without a substance you have been using multiple times a day FOR YEARS, without medical support or counseling support, shows your self awareness. The weed use was making your mental health struggles worse- then when you stopped,on your own,with no support- your doctor was a patronizing a\\*\\*. Good on you for seeing you needed to stop. Good on you for seeing you needed help for what you were using weed to self medicate. I wish you the best and I hope the people your idiot doctor sent you to will really help you live your best life. Good luck and godspeed.", "NTA.  You were advocating for yourself when he was being dismissive.  Sometimes it takes strong language to make your point known.  Good on you for standing up for yourself and kicking an addiction.", "NTA. His intentions may of been good, but he went about it in an extremely unprofessional way. He shot himself in the foot, if anything. Don't let all the AA extremists saying YTA get to you.", "NTA, he was not listening to you and getting what kind of help you need.", "NTA - I had conjunctivitis; puffy red eyes, stuck together with mucus and the doctor said I just needed wash my face.  She lectured me on how to wash my hands and said I didn\u2019t need medication. So I rubbed my eyes and touched everything in the room; door handle was first. She screamed at me to stop but I said \u201csince I\u2019m not contagious, this should not be a problem\u201d.  I was amazed at how quick she wrote that prescription.

They have done more studies in recent years and found that stopping heavy cannabis use can cause anxiety and anger issues until it\u2019s been dealt with.  I would recommend both counseling and addiction services both will help deal with the reason why the use was so heavy for so long and how to deal with those feelings going forward to avoid going back to it during difficult times.  Maybe consider marijuana anonymous if OP lives in an area where they exist (there\u2019s a lot fewer of those meetings vs AA or NA)", "Yeah this is just an odd comment to be honest.

Anxiety which WEED only made worse. \n\nIf you must know I did a lot about the \u201cthings\u201d that caused anxiety, none of which helped that\u2019s why I started smoking.

That was a shitty situation for both of them- he told her a hard truth. He could have done it better. She could have listened better.

It\u2019s a real thing, and it\u2019s not an \u201codd comment\u201d.  Another term for it, to borrow from AA, is that you\u2019re currently a dry drunk. Not actively abusing the substance is not the same as getting sober. A lot of people have commented trying to help you, trying to keep from calling you an AH, and you\u2019re so defensive that you\u2019re not getting it.", "I agree with NAH. I understand OP was looking for a counseling referral and got frustrated when that was being ignored. I also understand a physician recommending addiction services to address the initial issue and prevent relapse. OP, congratulations on 3 weeks! Try not to keep replaying this interaction in your head, which I know is easier said than done (I say that as someone with anxiety who does the same thing). I can also say that as someone who has worked alongside doctors for over 2 years, and is headed for medical school in a few months, I promise you are not the first person who has yelled at him and you won\u2019t be the last.
