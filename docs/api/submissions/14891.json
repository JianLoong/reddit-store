No, you shouldn\u2019t have shouted at him. Speaking as a recovering addict (opiates), he was correct from a medical standpoint. Three weeks is not enough time for the drug to even exit your body (you\u2019ll be good in another week or maybe a bit longer, depending on your body). From an addiction recovery standpoint, three weeks is HUGE. It\u2019s an enormous accomplishment. It\u2019s a difficult change you\u2019ve committed to and hearing someone dismiss it is soul-crushing. I would strongly recommend finding a meeting (one positive effect of COVID is there are Zoom AA and NA meetings that you can attend pretty much any hour of the day (like I live in the states and not too long ago I needed a meeting. It was 3am here so I found a meeting on Zoom being held in London- it was great! And a reminder that A LOT of people have substance abuse problems.) NAH, your doctor should have been kinder but you also shouldn\u2019t have expected him to be a trained addiction specialist, and he was not wrong.  Best of luck with your journey, it keeps getting better!", "NAH, mainly because he\u2019s right. Having only stopped for a couple of weeks when you were a regular every day user doesn\u2019t really mean a lot, and you could benefit from addiction services. Relapse is frequent and somewhat expected and if you\u2019re not wanting to go back to using, having that resource will only help you. They can also help you work through associated anxiety. It would help you continue on with not using when things got difficult.  You\u2019re not an AH for getting upset feeling like you weren\u2019t being listened to, but just because he doesn\u2019t say what you want to hear doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t listening. You ended up losing out on a resource you could have had on top of the one you wanted.  It\u2019s really never okay to verbally abuse healthcare workers, but if you were truly in the middle of an anxiety attack, it isn\u2019t really something you can help.", "Editing because I want to open a bit more positive. You\u2019re doing great! This wasn\u2019t one of your shining moments, but that\u2019s what early sobriety **is**.  \n\nThree weeks is commendable, but is also literally the barest beginnings (speaking from personal experience).\n\nSeeing as his response made you \u201chave a panic attack\u201d lose control, and yell at him, you should seriously consider whatever resources he was recommending to you **to help you**.\n\nYou did get yourself in this position. And you took the first steps getting yourself out of it!! For the record, that\u2019s awesome and **I\u2019m proud of you** and I\u2019ve been there. But, doctors don\u2019t exist to be proud of us, they exist to provide medical help and you yelled at yours for spitting simple unpleasant facts, so YTA but **you\u2019re doing great, keep it up, and soon you won\u2019t be an asshole**.\n\nBut do stop yelling at doctors lol. Congrats on almost a month! This will be a hilarious story someday.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is right. Three weeks mean nothing.

If you look it up on Google, you'll see your own picture.  \n\nYeah, the doc was unprofessional and a little dickish. \n\nBut you deserved it.

Proud of you. \n\n\n\nHe was really dismissive of your achievement, and that sort of comment is uncalled for and unhelpful. \nWhile I don\u2019t condone shouting at doctors, hopefully it made him think twice and will stop him saying similar in the future. Glad you got the referral you needed, best of luck to you in the future", "The MD could have been more supportive.  I understand why that set you off.  Gotta give you TONS of credit for realizing your issue and doing something about it. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re seeking counseling. Wish you lotsa luck and happiness!!!", "YTA. Well done you, v but even you say you were addicted, and three weeks isn't that kind really. I'm bordering on esh, as the Dr works have explained what they could be done for you if you were (eg) clean for 3 months etc, but it's very lopsided towards you", "That's so demoralizing to say to a patient. My father's 250 days of sobriety started with the first 3 weeks. My mother's 20 years of sobriety started with the first three weeks. \n\nWhy would a physician deny a patient counseling if they recommend addiction services anyways?? A physician who is licensed in addiction medicine would recommend psychotherapy too. I can't blame you for shouting. It's really hard to advocate for yourself in the medical system. \n\nProud of you for the progress you've made NTA", "So\u2026.. gonna be unpopular I guess and say NTA. He definitely could have had better bedside manner. You stopped on your own with no help, however he needs to encourage addiction services to you, when you tell him you just stopped smoking weed and were addicted. He didn\u2019t have to be an AH about it. Most doctors would say, \u201cI\u2019m really glad to hear you haven\u2019t smoked for 21 days. Let me tell you about some support we can offer\u2026\u201d idk, it wouldn\u2019t have taken much to not be rude.", "No doctor should ever speak down to or be condescending towards someone who is asking for help. Ever. I feel bad for you ans hope you found someone who will listen. \n\nNTA. I would\u2019ve gotten upset, too. I\u2019ve been misdiagnosed so many times and not listened to, so I empathise. I once told doctors I was sure I had a ruptured disc in my spine. They didn\u2019t listen \u2014 guess what? I had a ruptured disc in my spine and required emergency surgery. To this day I have nerve damage because I was ignored for so long. Makes me hate doctors.", "I really don\u2019t understand anyone who is saying Y T A or even E S H. You are NTA. You\u2019ve accomplished a huge thing and you\u2019re taking all the steps you should be to get help. The doctor dismissed you and didn\u2019t listen to you. \nHe is right that addiction services would be helpful even though you\u2019ve stopped smoking. Addiction services are more than just drying out. It includes psychotherapy, psychiatry, social work, and a whole host of other things. BUT the onus is on him to explain his rationale and help you understand why he\u2019s making this recommendation, instead of just telling you that \u201cthree weeks is nothing\u201d. It\u2019s not nothing. It isn\u2019t everything, but he was unnecessarily dismissive of you. \nYou shouldn\u2019t have shouted at him, but you\u2019re in a vulnerable position right now and asking for help. You\u2019re doing exactly what you\u2019re supposed to do in this situation. His bedside manner is crap and he gave you a panic attack.\nDoctors go to school to become doctors, but they often neglect to develop the people skills necessary to deal with patients in an effective manner.\nI\u2019m future, is there someone you trust who you can bring to doctor\u2019s appointments with you? I find having someone impartial there who knows your situation and symptoms can be incredibly beneficial. They can help communicate and listen without becoming emotional and can help you with any response you have afterwards.", "NTA - you didnt start yelling to him right off from the start. You made your position on your relationship with weed clear as well as the type if help you wanted to seek. \n\nHe ignored this, downplayed your recovery so far, and persisted on his stance regardless of your multiple rebuttals. This constant push eventually led to your outburst.\n\nRecovery is different for each person and it can be a difficult journey. Maybe eventually you do realize you want those addiction services. Maybe you dont. Right now though, you want those recommended counseling services as you find it the best suited for your personal recovery.", "NTA. \n\nDoctors get fixated on their ideas sometimes.  \nDon't go back.", "get a second opinion.. women are often dismissed   medical profession even today", "NTA- Comments like this ARE WHY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE ADDICTED TO SHIT.

Especially a patient that is seeking help. Congratulations on your three weeks!!", "Nta, he's a dick and not a good doc. He was not listening.", "NTA for shouting at him. You are currently suffering from weed withdrawal symptoms which includes heightened anxiety. You do need a support structure but saying \"That means nothing\" completely invalidates the work you put forth. \n\nHe was an ass.", "His comment was not professional and dismissive to a great accomplishment. I can understand why you were upset but yelling at him wasn't the way to go. ESH here but him more than you.", "NTA.\n\nThe Dr was . not . listening  . to . you. He was completely dismissive and disrespectful. Good for you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA. going 3 weeks without a substance you have been using multiple times a day FOR YEARS, without medical support or counseling support, shows your self awareness. The weed use was making your mental health struggles worse- then when you stopped,on your own,with no support- your doctor was a patronizing a\\*\\*. Good on you for seeing you needed to stop. Good on you for seeing you needed help for what you were using weed to self medicate. I wish you the best and I hope the people your idiot doctor sent you to will really help you live your best life. Good luck and godspeed.", "NTA.  You were advocating for yourself when he was being dismissive.  Sometimes it takes strong language to make your point known.  Good on you for standing up for yourself and kicking an addiction.", "NTA. His intentions may of been good, but he went about it in an extremely unprofessional way. He shot himself in the foot, if anything. Don't let all the AA extremists saying YTA get to you.", "NTA, he was not listening to you and getting what kind of help you need.", "NTA - I had conjunctivitis; puffy red eyes, stuck together with mucus and the doctor said I just needed wash my face.

Like others have said, it seems like he needs to improve his bedside manner.", "Congratulations on recognizing the problem and seeking help.  Whether you are an addict or not, your body is likely still going through withdrawals, and will be for some time, So the doctor wasn\u2019t wrong.", "NTA. 3 weeks clean is 3 WEEKS CLEAN. It's not to be downplayed! That's a huge change! I am struggling with drinking, and every EVERY negative remark hurts me. Find a healthy, supportive group \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA F that guy and all doctors who don't listen to their patients, treat them as drug seekers, minimize your symptoms or any of the 1000 other shitty things they do instead of, you know, their damn job.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't have shouted, but there are some doctors who just simply won't listen to their patients, and I have no idea what to do with them. I wouldn't shout, but I don't think you're an AH for shouting, especially considering your predicament. It sounds like your doctor ultimately agrees. Maybe the doctor will listen more carefully in the future.", "The doctor isn\u2019t an AH but he\u2019s incompetent if he says things like that to people.", ">You ended up losing out on a resource you could have had on top of the one you wanted.  It\u2019s really never okay to verbally abuse healthcare workers,\n\nThis. What you did was not OK. And you also hurt yourself by pushing away someone who could've helped you.\n\nI hope you treat your consellor better than this doctor.", "I absolutely love how you handled that situation! I'm so thankful to have a wonderful primary care doctor in my life. I've had my share of jerks over the years so I know how much of a difference it makes.", "Hah! This made my day. Fucking asshole doctors. I have fired so many. The doctors I have now have been my doctors for years because I doctor shopped until I found skilled practitioners who LISTEN.", "I agree that from a medical standpoint it means nothing, but from a personal compassionate standpoint it does mean something.", "3 weeks is a lot to someone trying to get sober. Stop downplaying it because sh*t like that makes people fall off the bandwagon, since they feel like they\u2019re trapped in a cycle of addiction. OP only mentioned it IN PASSING because it would possibly be a factor in the anxiety. She hasn\u2019t had the urge to smoke in those 3 weeks and has stayed away from it. I think that\u2019s a pretty good grasp for someone trying to get sober. Some people go a year until they fall off and have to start all over again.\n\nPeople like you are the reason why my mother struggled with alcohol addiction. Her family made her feel less than even if she felt proud of being off of it for a month. \n\nShe felt like she couldn\u2019t do it because people actively discouraged her with this sort of talk, so she nearly offed herself.", "Bang on!", "Not every mental health professional that specializes in substance abuse issues works in a rehab.", "I wonder if a therapist who specializes in substance abuse issues would help OP navigate their withdrawal symptoms?  Just like OP\u2019s doctor suggested in the appointment. \ud83d\ude44", "Are you kidding me?", "It has nothing to do with gender. OP verbally abused a doctor. \n\nDoctors are there to check patients and give medical advice. They are not just dispensers of referral letters. \n\nThe doctor was totally right to inquire (it seemed gently) about drug use. How could the doctor know if this patient just needed counselling, or needed detox, or perhaps some other medical intervention if he hadn't asked?", "I don't think that gender plays a role here. In med school we learn that while it is great if a person stops using drugs, more often than not they relapse, even more so if it was cold turkey. I agree it could have been worded alot better and he could have shown more emapathy, but i don't thin that his approach was inherently wrong, so NAH.\n\nThat being said, OP you are doing great and don't let yourself be discouraged by this interaction.", "OP, I think you are NTA. People are pointing out that it makes sense for your doctor to be concerned that you are \u201conly\u201d three weeks sober, but that is not the issue you were asking help for. Doctor was too pushy and presumptuous. If they had asked for your permission to discuss services for addiction, that would be a better approach then dismissing you. I don\u2019t think you should feel bad for having a big emotional response. A doctors office should be a nonjudgmental and safe space and you\u2019re going through a lot right now.", "Congrats on the three weeks, but you seem totally insufferable. You need to learn to listen to people.", "Bedside manner matters", "He was talking to a patient about a mental illness and showed no empathy. Yet you think he wasn\u2019t inherently wrong? His approach 100% wrong. There was nothing he did correct at all. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t have the skills to do it right. Doctors can\u2019t be experts in everything. But his bedside manner needs work for sure.", ">A doctors office should be a nonjudgmental and safe space\n\nA doctor's office should also be a safe space for the doctor. My friend is an ER doctor in Canada, and the amount of verbal and sometimes physical abuse he faces - especially from young drug users - is astounding. \n\nThe sub isn't judging whether the doctor is an AH. It's whether OP is -- and in the moments she was screaming and cursing at a doctor, she was. Just because she have reasons for being an AH (anxiety, etc) doesn't mean it's right. \n\nWe're also hearing from what an unreliable narrator. OP said she \"blanked out\" and had an anxiety attack. She also has come here repeatedly to argue and defend herself. Doctors may not 100% word things perfectly, but it's very likely he just told her something she didn't want to hear -  which is that she also needs addiction recovery support. \n\nImagine being a doctor having to deal with that time and again. They are people, too. \n\nYTA, OP. Please get the help you need.", "Are YOU her doctor?? Lol", "Nah it\u2019s a good response. I\u2019m a fan of AA, but its what I call \u201cclassicalist approach\u201d is not at all accurate and I hate seeing people shoehorned into it by well meaning, but uneducated people who think addiction is one size fits all.\n\nIt also has a bad effect of setting people up for permanent judgement when we do now acknowledge that sometimes people stray into full on binge type coping behavior during periods of their life which perfectly parallels AAs idea of addiction, but does resolve when the outside factors resolve, IE it\u2019s not always \u201cwhite knuckling\u201d and there is plenty of medical documentation and evidence for \u201cspontaneous recovery\u201d though that\u2019s a terrible term, as what usually happens is a comorbid issue finally gets treatment.\n\nPoint being, I love AA and the classical approach and it\u2019s very helpful for people who need it, but it\u2019s fine to let people find their way and find what works before throwing terms like \u201cwhite knuckling\u201d at them. If they need AA it\u2019ll always be there waiting, but it\u2019s fine if this person tries other less intense things first, they just need to stop yelling at doctors lol. \n\nTLDR you\u2019re totally right to shut that shit down. If this persons on a journey that ends with AA, they\u2019ll get there.", "Hey OP. You did something very good. You went and sought help. Good job and keep going. I\u2019m an alcoholic. Drinking wasn\u2019t my problem, it was a whole bunch of shit that lead to drinking. \n\nKeep looking at those underlying problems. Take the referral. Focus on you. \n\nAnd I\u2019m going to suggest you stay off this thread. You don\u2019t need to be diving into overthinking your behavior right now. You went looking for a lifeline and got it. So focus on getting back to shore.", "Yeah, my main issues are how it's presented as the *only* option (especially when it comes to court ordered situations) and that people claim it's secular when it just simply is not. I'm also very resistant to putting just about anything on a pedestal.", "Yup, zero argument from me. My favorite oldtimer who basically taught me all the father stuff I didn\u2019t get once, was very fond of saying court ordered AA was the biggest well intentioned mistake anyone made, both for courts and for the AA program.", "Quick fact check!\n\nCourt can\u2019t legally order AA. They can only order you to attend support groups. AA is just the most common people attend. \n\nEvery AA group agrees on their own rules. There are atheist AA groups. It\u2019s non religious but \u201cspiritual.\u201d Everyone picks their own thing and their own groups. My BF and his sponsor are both atheists. I\u2019m agnostic. Physics can literally be your higher power. \n\nPlus you don\u2019t even have to work the steps to be a member. \u201cThe only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking\u201d You don\u2019t even need to be sober, you just want to be. \n\nNot every group and not all members believe that way. But that\u2019s what happens when a bunch of addicts get in groups. Many are toxic. But that is what the literature says."]}
