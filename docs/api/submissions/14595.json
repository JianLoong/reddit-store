I told him he should grow up and stop being crazy  he started crying and is now in the room talking to the stupid bear again instead of talking it out with me. \n\nHow does this guy make enough money for a 3 bed house on his own yet does stupid stuff like this? For the record we don\u2019t live together and completely support ourselves separately. Should I encourage him to get a hobby or something?\n\nAITA: For wanting a grown man to stop having teddy bears ?

He obviously has some emotional connection with the  bears as a way to cope with some trauma. It's not \"weird\". What's weird is that you're so insecure that you feel threatened by something as innocent as teddy bears. If I was him, I'd break up with you. Good luck", "You're trying to get him to confirm to social norms. If that's the case, then would you be ok if he was glued to the TV watching sports and start ignoring you because the game is on? How about if he starts playing Xbox with his friends and completely disregards your existence?\n\nWe all have quirks. We've become accustomed to middle aged men playing sport video games that it's become normal, but the fact is that it's still video games. The reality is that your bf replaced this with teddy bears instead, and you disagree. Sure I think it's weird, but if he's being a responsible adult - I don't see why you get to be the judge in deciding what's acceptable and not acceptable for an adult.\n\nI'm sure you have some quirks too that wouldn't be normal for \"adults\", but most people prob overlook at your quirks. Why is it diff for him? Take a step back and break things down in category of why you really don't like the teddy bear, and see if your reasoning is rational.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\n P.s Tell him to give me a call me and my Teddy would love to meet him!\n\nedit to fox typos", "YTA\n\nAlso come across as judgemental for the \u201chow does this guy make enough money for a 3 bed house yet own stupid stuff like that\u201d.", "YTA.\n\nThe only friend and confidante I had for too long was a teddy bear.

Saying \u201cstop being crazy\u201d never helped anyone, ever. Yes, it definitely sounds weird but dismissing it as \u201cstupid\u201d is callous. Are his family aware of the situation?

Your boyfriend's attachment to his teddy bears is not hurting anyone and is a harmless source of comfort for him. It is not your place to dictate what he should or should not have as a source of comfort.\n\nYour boyfriend's interest in teddy bears may seem strange to you, but it is not uncommon for adults to find comfort in stuffed animals. It is also not your place to judge what is a \"grown-up\" hobby or interest. People have different ways of coping with stress and finding comfort, and it is not fair to judge them for it.\n\nInstead of trying to change your boyfriend's behavior, you should try to understand and accept it. If it bothers you, you can communicate your feelings to him in a respectful manner and try to find a compromise. Encouraging him to get a hobby or talking down to him about his interests is not the solution.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to respect your partner's interests and hobbies, even if they seem unconventional to you. It is not fair to judge or shame them for finding comfort in something harmless.

Yta honestly, but if this is something that you feel that strongly about you need to have an actual discussion that\u2019s not telling your bf to grow up or insulting him.

The human mind doesn't do too well talking to an empty room, but talking to a specific thing is somehow different.
