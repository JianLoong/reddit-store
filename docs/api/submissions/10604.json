He and his family live  about 8 hours away from my home town and they were just there for the wedding. (I\u2019m Canadian and he\u2019s from the US)\nLong story short - we fell in love and got married around 2018. \nI had to go through a lot of immigration stuff and I couldn\u2019t travel freely for a while. I really missed my family. But life goes on. \n\nDuring this wait period I got pregnant and had our first child (2019). It was during the last few months of pregnancy that I got my travel papers and could finally travel, but I couldn\u2019t at that point due to pregnancy. After the baby we visited my family once or twice before Corona hit and every where was shut down. \n\nAfter the craziness of Corona finally eased, we visited my family in march 2022 for a FEW days - I think a long weekend. \n\nWhen we got back to the US, I found out 2 months later that I\u2019m pregnant with twins and I all of a sudden became a high risk pregnancy. \n\nAgain - we couldn\u2019t travel for a while. \n\nWe had our babies this fall. They have  gained good weight. They are good eaters and the pediatrician has no concerns. So now I\u2019m trying to plan a trip to my hometown. I miss my family terribly and I want them to meet my twins. I also feel very sad and alone since the only adult I talk to now is my husband and sometimes his mom when she comes over to help \n\nThis is where the issue starts-\nMy husband is saying I\u2019m a horrible mother for subjecting my babies to a 8 hour drive (we would obviously take breaks) and that I\u2019m putting them in harms way all for \u201c15mins of fame\u201d because I had \u201ctwins\u201d and so I can \u201cshow them off\u201d \nWe would fly, but the babies don\u2019t have their passports yet. \n\nHe keeps telling me that they are gonna get sick and lose all the weight they gained. And keeps making me feel like crap. He has made me cry several times by calling me selfish and all other kinds of names.  \n\nThey will be a little over 4months olds during our trip. \nI\u2019ve told him we can\u2019t keep putting our life on hold. \nI miss my family and of course my family will be cautious around them - not being around them if they are sic, etc. \nHe finally admitted that he doesn\u2019t want to do the 8hr drive and that he will be miserable with my family. \nBut he keepssaying the trip is unnecessary and I\u2019m selfish. \nI made crazy sacrifices to be here with him -left my family, job and friends. \nI feel like me going back home shouldn\u2019t even be up to him or his call. \nIf I want us to go, we will go. It\u2019s the least he can do for me.\nAll the holidays, thanksgivings and major events have been spent with what little family he has here. \n\nWe are now not talking to each other and he\u2019s extremely angry at me.\nBut I don\u2019t feel like the a-hole, but I\u2019m just wondering if I\u2019m missing something and maybe I am?\n\nI\u2019d like to mention - the babies have barely been outside the house because he won\u2019t allow it.
