Husband (36m) and I (32f) have a strained relationship with all of his family. Things are hot and cold with all of them. \n\nFor context, we live in same town as his parents, about 20 min drive. His sisters used to live here, but moved away last year. \nFor the last 10 years, every event and holiday and gathering has revolved around SIL1 and her family. She was the only one with kids. SIL2 is married, child free by choice. Neither sister works.\n\nAnyways, now we have a baby (8mo m). His parents see him maybe once a month, typically initiated by us, but that's a whole other story. \n\nSIL1 has seen our son twice since he's been born. For a total of maybe 3 hours combined. SIL2 has only seen him once.\n\nBoth of them have been in town since last Thursday. My husband and I both work full time. So you would think that they would have thought about the fact that seeing their nephew would probably be easiest to do over the weekend, or on the 4th when we had off work. But he obviously isn't a priority to them. \n\nOn the 4th, SIL1 texted husband and let us know that they'd be at their parents house the next day and that we should bring baby over to see everyone. \n\nMy husband was already hurt that we hadn't heard anything from them. He didn't respond that night.\n\nHe ended up responding the next morning and said we are working and baby will be with the sitter. \n\nShe responded saying \"well when can the kids see baby?\"\n\nI told him it was his call. At that point, the only options were Friday night or Saturday morning before they left. Weekday evenings are always a rush due to feeding a solid meal, bath time, me pumping, bedtime routine, etc. \n\nHusband told her we would be home Friday evening or Saturday morning. She responded saying they were leaving too early on Saturday, and had plans Friday night. She later said they could maybe manipulate plans to make Friday work. \n\nFriday rolls around and she let's us know they plan to stop by around 7.\n\nBaby's bedtime is 8:00, and sometimes hes ready for bed closer to 7:30 - we follow his sleepy cues. He ended up telling her that would be too close to his bedtime and the extra stimulation right before bed would throw off his whole routine. He told her they should try again next time theyre in town, and that maybe they'd make us a priority next time instead of an afterthought. He received no response, to no surprise.\n\nWe've tried to be flexible for the last several years, but we don't have much room for flexibility when I have a pump schedule, and baby has a feeding/nap/bedtime schedule. We are also sick of bowing down to what his sister wants. We want to be a priority, too. \n\nSo, AITA (well, my husband, not me) for telling them they can try again next time if they make us a priority?\n\nThe reason I'm wondering is because we're not giving my son a chance to see his cousins, and because I guess the wording could have been harsh.\n\nETA; we did tell them bedtime was at 8pm and that husband would be home at 5, and me earlier. We also let them know we'd be off Mon-tues, and asked to get together Mon. We got no response to those messages.", "created_utc": 1688830100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u75iq/aita_for_not_allowing_family_to_see_our_son_due/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you meant 5 say 5.  But then it would interfere with dinner, wouldn't it.  \n\nGetting together with siblings is a two way street.  They need to reach to you but you need to reach to them too.  Did you invite them for dinner or to hang out any day earlier?  If you don't invite you don't get to complain when they ask you to do something  late.  At least they tried and put some effort into it.  You put none.", "You are definitely NTA. And those saying you are, are the ones treating their family members this exact same way. You owe them nothing. They(including in-laws)have made it very clear how important you are to them. Believe me, I\u2019ve lived it the past 20 years. My daughters (26 & 21) have zero relationship with my husbands parents, because once his sister had her first child; their other grandchildren ceased to exist. They made no effort to spend time with our girls unless we initiated it. And when we were around them all his mom could do was talk about his sister and her kids. It\u2019s not worth the emotional effort. Just plan on seeing them at Christmas/maybe thanksgiving.", "Info: why didn\u2019t you bring your son over the day you were invited? Is that not your SIL making an effort? \n\nIt sounds like both you and your husband are reacting out of hurt.", "NTA \n\nThey think they are the center of the universe. For years, everything revolved around them and their kids. They expected that dynamic to continue,  even if it was not practical for your family. I'd they want to meet up, they need to actually schedule a time rather  than expecting you to drop your routines and plans to to revolve around them.", "ESH, this is very typical family drama. We only hear your side of story which reflects poorly on your SILs. But even then, you made it more difficult. If you follow strict schedule for the baby then you should specify cutoff time for Fri evening n start time for Sat morning. Kind of an AH move but this also feels like an indicator of what happens generally. There is too much tussle n bad blood already", "I'm leaning towards YTA since from what you said in your post they haven't said or done anything bad. If they want to prioritize other things they're free to do so. All she asked was when they'd be able to see your child, and you gave them a day without a clear time restriction. The one to first say or imply anything rude was your husband.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You told them when you were available, with 2 whole days they could have seen you. They didn't even bother to reply.", "We did ask them to come over earlier in the week. They did not respond. We let them know we'd be off work on Mon and Tues for the holiday. We didn't hear a word from them until after our days off.\n\nAlso when husband text her, he said bedtime is 8pm and that he'd be home at 5.

I think we did react out of hurt and maybe didn't go about it the best way. Thank you for your response", "They texted them they were off on monday and Tuesday. The sils didn\u2019t respond. However conventionally found time and ask for a visit on Wednesday. When they knew they would be working.", "Fair enough, I hear what you're saying. \nWe did try planning a meal. We invited all of his family over on Momday. We received no response from SIL in question. \n\nThen found out later that all of them went to a festival 2 minutes from our house. No invite, only found out because my niece posted about it. \n\nSo yeah, I think we're bitter because we're hurt and thay affected how we reacted. I don't want my son always wondering if his aunts care about trying to see him. I communicated the days we had off and were free. I offered to host something. My husband offered to smoke some meat.", "What time did you mean when you said evening", "Not responding does not make them AHs since we don't know why.", "[deleted]", "We told them if they wanted to come when we got off of work, and we specifically told the times we got off of work - 5pm for husband, 4pm for me.

I got a text invite to my nephews baptism just a day before the event. I was like you had this planned for a month at least and I get a text invite the day before. Sorry can't make it as I already have plans this weekend. Only if you have given me 1 week notice like you did for the rest of your guests who probably got more than a week's notice then I could have made it.", "NTA. They don't really want to see the baby if it takes any effort. And you don't really want to see their selfish selves.\n\nEveryone got what they wanted. Please don't let your feelings get hurt, they are who they are. Enjoy your baby with the people who want to see him.", "NAH\n\nYou both sound like petulant children because his family has not bowed down and worshipped your child in a manner you want and had events catered to the nieces/nephews when they lived close. \n\nDoesn't sound like your husband nor you are extremely close to his family.  They DID attempt to include you in the holiday, but if it was inconvenient, it was inconvenient.  No one is at fault there.\n\nWhen people are traveling to their hometown, with their own children, they have LOTS of stops to make.  Why do you become your own special priority just because you had a kid?  3 visits in 8 months to someone else's kid is a LOT.  \n\nIt is unfortunate that the drop by didn't happen, but seriously this is not some gigantic slight to you and your kid, it is called a vacation with lots of activities and people to address.\n\nPlease get off your victim wagon and just appreciate that they at least attempted to get together and maybe reach out and PLAN something next time they are in town.  The phone works two ways.", "YTA but a soft one. it's hard when families get bigger. They are being an arse too. You can't all be the priority.\n\nI live out of town and my SIL is always wanting me to work in specific times to see them and the kids around work and their schedule. From my point of view, I've driven 6 hours and taken time off work, can their be some give. Also if they come to my parents (2km.away) I can see them and everybody together, which for a limited visit is so cool. I get so little time with everyone if I visit everyone individually. Just another view.\nFamilies are hard. Having a baby is hard.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to worry about \u201cnot giving your son a chance to see his cousins,\u201d because he\u2019s 8 months old. He will be as genuinely happy to see a paper plate as a person at that age. He doesn\u2019t know who his cousins are.\n\nI also don\u2019t love how your SIL responded \u201cWell when can the kids see baby?\u201d As if he\u2019s an exhibit at the zoo they\u2019ve been wanting to visit. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with her saying it, I admit I can see it being said in plenty of contexts that would be fine, but I still just don\u2019t love that wording. If his cousins were just SO EXCITED to see the baby, you\u2019re right, your in-laws should have made it more of a priority to see you.\n\nIt ends up feeling like SIL is probably more upset that she has to tell her kids it\u2019s not going to happen than she is that she didn\u2019t get to see her own brother or nephew.", "You hit the nail on the head with how we've felt.\nWe lived away and always made an effort to see them when we were home. We worked around their schedule and came when they said was convenient. We missed out on lots of things we could have done with friends so that we could see our niece and nephew. \nHis parents only see our son when we've initiated it and we're about to be done initiating it, because it's always one sided. And they also constantly talk about their other grandkids constantly - often comparing our son to our nephew. \nIt's so emotionally exhausting", "This is typically how it goes. We used to just change our plans around to accommodate them, but it's a lot harder to do now, and we're honestly tired of doing it.", "We had already told them when they could see us. And they chose to not respond to us until that time had passed, asking when they could see our son. That's what we're so frustrated about. They could have seen us at any time during the first 4 days of their visit - we let them know that - but they ignored the message and then expected us to accommodate on a day we work, during the work day. Then decided they could squeeze in a few minutes at an inconvenient time for us.\nThey didn't even want to make enough time for an actual visit. They were going to *try* to stop by for a few minutes. Basically long enough to take pictures so they can play auntie of the year on Facebook (what they did last time they visited - came long enough to take a few pics and stayed a whopping 30 minutes, then posted on fb how much they love their nephew and they're his favorite aunt)\n\nEdit: sorry, I feel like I left out a lot of relevant info in my OP due to length.", "I understand completely!! When we had our first child, I made an effort to not make a difference between my parents and my in-laws. I loved my in-laws and had a great relationship, and they were a big part of our lives. Fast forward 4 years, SIL and I both get pregnant at the same time. Her first, my second. I had my daughter first and I remember my husbands other brother asking me if I wasn't afraid that now that their sister was pregnant, I wasn't afraid our kids would be pushed to the back burner, and I couldn't fathom that happening. But it did, BIG TIME. Do not feel guilty about not making extra effort for anything. I always let them know then the girls had things and they would come to those, but any form of them going out of the way to spend time with my kids, outside of what I initiated never happened. Ever! We all live in the same town too, so distance is not an issue. I have so many stories. Once my girls both turned 18, I told my husband I was done! Of course he got mad, they're his parents, it's their choice who they want to spend time with. But he and his brother grew up with sister being the golden child, so I guess to him it's normal and he doesn't care how it made his kids feel. But I care. I don't wish anything bad on his parents, or hate them. I'm just indifferent. It's not worth the emotional toil. It really isn't. Your children will be fine. You can't miss what you never had.", "In regards to the time thing - I meant if your son is going to go to sleep at 8, and you don't want anyone to potentially disrupt that, then you should have said something along the lines of, \"You can stop by at any time before 6pm so that it doesn't disrupt his bedtime\". Saying that he's going to sleep at 8pm is not the same as saying, \"We don't think you should visit an hour before bedtime, and it'd be best if you come at 6pm or earlier if you want to spend time with him\". You never disallowed 7-8pm in the initial message based on what you've said in your post.\n\nIf they don't want to spend a significant amount of time with you all they are allowed to make that decision. It is up to you two to decide whether or not you are fine with that though. There isn't anything inherently wrong with them only wanting to spend half an hour with you all during their visit.", "It only takes a minute to respond that doesn\u2019t work for us but we will get back to you. Even now of days you can like a message to simple acknowledge it.", "That alone does not make them AHs in this situation.i agree that it takes little effort to reply to messages and have had this discussion with others in my own life before, but that alone does not put them in the wrong. I can definitely say they're rude if they saw and didn't respond, but not AHs."]}
