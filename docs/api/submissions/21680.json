Husband (36m) and I (32f) have a strained relationship with all of his family. Things are hot and cold with all of them. \n\nFor context, we live in same town as his parents, about 20 min drive. His sisters used to live here, but moved away last year. \nFor the last 10 years, every event and holiday and gathering has revolved around SIL1 and her family. She was the only one with kids. SIL2 is married, child free by choice. Neither sister works.\n\nAnyways, now we have a baby (8mo m). His parents see him maybe once a month, typically initiated by us, but that's a whole other story. \n\nSIL1 has seen our son twice since he's been born. For a total of maybe 3 hours combined. SIL2 has only seen him once.\n\nBoth of them have been in town since last Thursday. My husband and I both work full time. So you would think that they would have thought about the fact that seeing their nephew would probably be easiest to do over the weekend, or on the 4th when we had off work. But he obviously isn't a priority to them. \n\nOn the 4th, SIL1 texted husband and let us know that they'd be at their parents house the next day and that we should bring baby over to see everyone. \n\nMy husband was already hurt that we hadn't heard anything from them. He didn't respond that night.\n\nHe ended up responding the next morning and said we are working and baby will be with the sitter. \n\nShe responded saying \"well when can the kids see baby?\"\n\nI told him it was his call. At that point, the only options were Friday night or Saturday morning before they left. Weekday evenings are always a rush due to feeding a solid meal, bath time, me pumping, bedtime routine, etc. \n\nHusband told her we would be home Friday evening or Saturday morning. She responded saying they were leaving too early on Saturday, and had plans Friday night. She later said they could maybe manipulate plans to make Friday work. \n\nFriday rolls around and she let's us know they plan to stop by around 7.\n\nBaby's bedtime is 8:00, and sometimes hes ready for bed closer to 7:30 - we follow his sleepy cues. He ended up telling her that would be too close to his bedtime and the extra stimulation right before bed would throw off his whole routine. He told her they should try again next time theyre in town, and that maybe they'd make us a priority next time instead of an afterthought. He received no response, to no surprise.\n\nWe've tried to be flexible for the last several years, but we don't have much room for flexibility when I have a pump schedule, and baby has a feeding/nap/bedtime schedule. We are also sick of bowing down to what his sister wants. We want to be a priority, too. \n\nSo, AITA (well, my husband, not me) for telling them they can try again next time if they make us a priority?\n\nThe reason I'm wondering is because we're not giving my son a chance to see his cousins, and because I guess the wording could have been harsh.\n\nETA; we did tell them bedtime was at 8pm and that husband would be home at 5, and me earlier. We also let them know we'd be off Mon-tues, and asked to get together Mon. We got no response to those messages.", "created_utc": 1688830100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u75iq/aita_for_not_allowing_family_to_see_our_son_due/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you meant 5 say 5.  But then it would interfere with dinner, wouldn't it.  \n\nGetting together with siblings is a two way street.  They need to reach to you but you need to reach to them too.  Did you invite them for dinner or to hang out any day earlier?  If you don't invite you don't get to complain when they ask you to do something  late.  At least they tried and put some effort into it.  You put none.", "You are definitely NTA. And those saying you are, are the ones treating their family members this exact same way. You owe them nothing. They(including in-laws)have made it very clear how important you are to them. Believe me, I\u2019ve lived it the past 20 years. My daughters (26 & 21) have zero relationship with my husbands parents, because once his sister had her first child; their other grandchildren ceased to exist. They made no effort to spend time with our girls unless we initiated it. And when we were around them all his mom could do was talk about his sister and her kids. It\u2019s not worth the emotional effort. Just plan on seeing them at Christmas/maybe thanksgiving.", "Info: why didn\u2019t you bring your son over the day you were invited? Is that not your SIL making an effort? \n\nIt sounds like both you and your husband are reacting out of hurt.", "NTA \n\nThey think they are the center of the universe. For years, everything revolved around them and their kids. They expected that dynamic to continue,  even if it was not practical for your family. I'd they want to meet up, they need to actually schedule a time rather  than expecting you to drop your routines and plans to to revolve around them.", "ESH, this is very typical family drama. We only hear your side of story which reflects poorly on your SILs. But even then, you made it more difficult. If you follow strict schedule for the baby then you should specify cutoff time for Fri evening n start time for Sat morning. Kind of an AH move but this also feels like an indicator of what happens generally. There is too much tussle n bad blood already", "I'm leaning towards YTA since from what you said in your post they haven't said or done anything bad. If they want to prioritize other things they're free to do so. All she asked was when they'd be able to see your child, and you gave them a day without a clear time restriction. The one to first say or imply anything rude was your husband.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You told them when you were available, with 2 whole days they could have seen you. They didn't even bother to reply.", "We did ask them to come over earlier in the week. They did not respond. We let them know we'd be off work on Mon and Tues for the holiday. We didn't hear a word from them until after our days off.\n\nAlso when husband text her, he said bedtime is 8pm and that he'd be home at 5. I originally tried to put all of that in my OP, but I was at the character limit and had to shorten. I edited it to reflect those details", "Also she did not even change her plans. She just said they could *try* to stop by after her plans were over.", "We both had to work, and they knew that. They said they'd be there mid morning to afternoon, not during hours we were off. \n\nAnd yes, part of our reaction is out of hurt. We're sick of being the last priority and revolving things about his sister. We lived away and she never made an effort when we were in town - but we still made them a priority every single time.", "Also, we'd already paid for child care for the day. Had we know in advance, we could have chosen to not take him for the day. He'll, we could have taken a vacation day off of work if we'd know in advance.", "I understand and hear what you're saying. I think we did react out of hurt and maybe didn't go about it the best way. Thank you for your response", "They texted them they were off on monday and Tuesday. The sils didn\u2019t respond. However conventionally found time and ask for a visit on Wednesday. When they knew they would be working.", "Fair enough, I hear what you're saying. \nWe did try planning a meal. We invited all of his family over on Momday. We received no response from SIL in question. \n\nThen found out later that all of them went to a festival 2 minutes from our house. No invite, only found out because my niece posted about it. \n\nSo yeah, I think we're bitter because we're hurt and thay affected how we reacted. I don't want my son always wondering if his aunts care about trying to see him. I communicated the days we had off and were free. I offered to host something. My husband offered to smoke some meat.", "What time did you mean when you said evening", "Not responding does not make them AHs since we don't know why.", "[deleted]", "We told them if they wanted to come when we got off of work, and we specifically told the times we got off of work - 5pm for husband, 4pm for me. We also specifically said his bedtime is 8 at the latest.", "Yes it does. It hurts on a whole other level when you have the fear of your child feeling it."]}
