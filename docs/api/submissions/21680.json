SIL2 is married, child free by choice. Neither sister works.\n\nAnyways, now we have a baby (8mo m).

SIL2 has only seen him once.\n\nBoth of them have been in town since last Thursday. My husband and I both work full time. So you would think that they would have thought about the fact that seeing their nephew would probably be easiest to do over the weekend, or on the 4th when we had off work. But he obviously isn't a priority to them. \n\nOn the 4th, SIL1 texted husband and let us know that they'd be at their parents house the next day and that we should bring baby over to see everyone. \n\nMy husband was already hurt that we hadn't heard anything from them. He didn't respond that night.\n\nHe ended up responding the next morning and said we are working and baby will be with the sitter. \n\nShe responded saying \"well when can the kids see baby?\"\n\nI told him it was his call. At that point, the only options were Friday night or Saturday morning before they left. Weekday evenings are always a rush due to feeding a solid meal, bath time, me pumping, bedtime routine, etc. \n\nHusband told her we would be home Friday evening or Saturday morning. She responded saying they were leaving too early on Saturday, and had plans Friday night. She later said they could maybe manipulate plans to make Friday work. \n\nFriday rolls around and she let's us know they plan to stop by around 7.\n\nBaby's bedtime is 8:00, and sometimes hes ready for bed closer to 7:30 - we follow his sleepy cues.

We are also sick of bowing down to what his sister wants. We want to be a priority, too. \n\nSo, AITA (well, my husband, not me) for telling them they can try again next time if they make us a priority?\n\nThe reason I'm wondering is because we're not giving my son a chance to see his cousins, and because I guess the wording could have been harsh.\n\nETA; we did tell them bedtime was at 8pm and that husband would be home at 5, and me earlier.

You owe them nothing. They(including in-laws)have made it very clear how important you are to them. Believe me, I\u2019ve lived it the past 20 years. My daughters (26 & 21) have zero relationship with my husbands parents, because once his sister had her first child; their other grandchildren ceased to exist. They made no effort to spend time with our girls unless we initiated it. And when we were around them all his mom could do was talk about his sister and her kids. It\u2019s not worth the emotional effort. Just plan on seeing them at Christmas/maybe thanksgiving.", "Info: why didn\u2019t you bring your son over the day you were invited? Is that not your SIL making an effort? \n\nIt sounds like both you and your husband are reacting out of hurt.", "NTA \n\nThey think they are the center of the universe. For years, everything revolved around them and their kids. They expected that dynamic to continue,  even if it was not practical for your family. I'd they want to meet up, they need to actually schedule a time rather  than expecting you to drop your routines and plans to to revolve around them.", "ESH, this is very typical family drama. We only hear your side of story which reflects poorly on your SILs. But even then, you made it more difficult. If you follow strict schedule for the baby then you should specify cutoff time for Fri evening n start time for Sat morning. Kind of an AH move but this also feels like an indicator of what happens generally. There is too much tussle n bad blood already", "I'm leaning towards YTA since from what you said in your post they haven't said or done anything bad. If they want to prioritize other things they're free to do so. All she asked was when they'd be able to see your child, and you gave them a day without a clear time restriction.

They DID attempt to include you in the holiday, but if it was inconvenient, it was inconvenient.  No one is at fault there.\n\nWhen people are traveling to their hometown, with their own children, they have LOTS of stops to make.  Why do you become your own special priority just because you had a kid?  3 visits in 8 months to someone else's kid is a LOT.  \n\nIt is unfortunate that the drop by didn't happen, but seriously this is not some gigantic slight to you and your kid, it is called a vacation with lots of activities and people to address.\n\nPlease get off your victim wagon and just appreciate that they at least attempted to get together and maybe reach out and PLAN something next time they are in town.  The phone works two ways.", "YTA but a soft one. it's hard when families get bigger. They are being an arse too. You can't all be the priority.\n\nI live out of town and my SIL is always wanting me to work in specific times to see them and the kids around work and their schedule. From my point of view, I've driven 6 hours and taken time off work, can their be some give. Also if they come to my parents (2km.away) I can see them and everybody together, which for a limited visit is so cool. I get so little time with everyone if I visit everyone individually.

He doesn\u2019t know who his cousins are.\n\nI also don\u2019t love how your SIL responded \u201cWell when can the kids see baby?\u201d As if he\u2019s an exhibit at the zoo they\u2019ve been wanting to visit. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with her saying it, I admit I can see it being said in plenty of contexts that would be fine, but I still just don\u2019t love that wording. If his cousins were just SO EXCITED to see the baby, you\u2019re right, your in-laws should have made it more of a priority to see you.\n\nIt ends up feeling like SIL is probably more upset that she has to tell her kids it\u2019s not going to happen than she is that she didn\u2019t get to see her own brother or nephew.", "You hit the nail on the head with how we've felt.\nWe lived away and always made an effort to see them when we were home. We worked around their schedule and came when they said was convenient. We missed out on lots of things we could have done with friends so that we could see our niece and nephew. \nHis parents only see our son when we've initiated it and we're about to be done initiating it, because it's always one sided. And they also constantly talk about their other grandkids constantly - often comparing our son to our nephew. \nIt's so emotionally exhausting", "This is typically how it goes. We used to just change our plans around to accommodate them, but it's a lot harder to do now, and we're honestly tired of doing it.", "We had already told them when they could see us. And they chose to not respond to us until that time had passed, asking when they could see our son. That's what we're so frustrated about. They could have seen us at any time during the first 4 days of their visit - we let them know that - but they ignored the message and then expected us to accommodate on a day we work, during the work day. Then decided they could squeeze in a few minutes at an inconvenient time for us.\nThey didn't even want to make enough time for an actual visit. They were going to *try* to stop by for a few minutes. Basically long enough to take pictures so they can play auntie of the year on Facebook (what they did last time they visited - came long enough to take a few pics and stayed a whopping 30 minutes, then posted on fb how much they love their nephew and they're his favorite aunt)\n\nEdit: sorry, I feel like I left out a lot of relevant info in my OP due to length.", "I understand completely!! When we had our first child, I made an effort to not make a difference between my parents and my in-laws. I loved my in-laws and had a great relationship, and they were a big part of our lives. Fast forward 4 years, SIL and I both get pregnant at the same time. Her first, my second. I had my daughter first and I remember my husbands other brother asking me if I wasn't afraid that now that their sister was pregnant, I wasn't afraid our kids would be pushed to the back burner, and I couldn't fathom that happening. But it did, BIG TIME. Do not feel guilty about not making extra effort for anything. I always let them know then the girls had things and they would come to those, but any form of them going out of the way to spend time with my kids, outside of what I initiated never happened. Ever! We all live in the same town too, so distance is not an issue. I have so many stories. Once my girls both turned 18, I told my husband I was done! Of course he got mad, they're his parents, it's their choice who they want to spend time with. But he and his brother grew up with sister being the golden child, so I guess to him it's normal and he doesn't care how it made his kids feel. But I care. I don't wish anything bad on his parents, or hate them. I'm just indifferent. It's not worth the emotional toil. It really isn't. Your children will be fine. You can't miss what you never had.", "In regards to the time thing - I meant if your son is going to go to sleep at 8, and you don't want anyone to potentially disrupt that, then you should have said something along the lines of, \"You can stop by at any time before 6pm so that it doesn't disrupt his bedtime\". Saying that he's going to sleep at 8pm is not the same as saying, \"We don't think you should visit an hour before bedtime, and it'd be best if you come at 6pm or earlier if you want to spend time with him\". You never disallowed 7-8pm in the initial message based on what you've said in your post.\n\nIf they don't want to spend a significant amount of time with you all they are allowed to make that decision. It is up to you two to decide whether or not you are fine with that though. There isn't anything inherently wrong with them only wanting to spend half an hour with you all during their visit.", "It only takes a minute to respond that doesn\u2019t work for us but we will get back to you. Even now of days you can like a message to simple acknowledge it.", "That alone does not make them AHs in this situation.i agree that it takes little effort to reply to messages and have had this discussion with others in my own life before, but that alone does not put them in the wrong. I can definitely say they're rude if they saw and didn't respond, but not AHs.", "NTA, your child is 8 months and they do not need to come at his bedtime.  As for him seeing his cousins?? He is way too young to understand or to remember if he sees them or not.  They were in town for a full week and blew you off until the last night.  If they want to see him they need to make him a priority.", "ESH- Could they have made more of an effort earlier? Yes, absolutely. \n\nWith that said, I think you and your husband came into the situation already hurt and defensive. You didn't need to wait until they contacted you. The baby would have been fine if they were a little off their evening schedule. At the end of it all, your baby didn't get to spend time with their family. That sucks.", "NTA - but people/family don't have to be interested in a relationship with your child. That's your expectation not theirs.", "NTA \n\nYou can let yours pal the way off the hook with these people. You and your family are not a priority for them.

The SILs seem to not really care if they see you or the kid.  It is not their priority.  If they want to see the kid, they need to work around the baby's schedule.

The last time they came to town, they stopped by long enough to get a couple pics of them with our baby - then posted on fb about how much they love their nephew and how she's the favorite auntie, blah blah blah.", "After plans would most likely be a lot later after you son was sound asleep.", "Unfortunately you're not her priority. It's good that you're figuring this out now, because your son can have lower expectations from their promises in the future. \n\nProtect him from this not cold behaviour rather than letting him lap up any crumbs of affection they give. Perhaps his cousins will be better and genuine, but be cautious", "They were told beforehand when they were available. What time bedtime and getting off work was. They ignored that and wanted to meet when they saw convenient. Its one thing to say unfortunately none of those times work for us. Hopefully we can see you on the next visit.

Which may seem like they wanted it to seem like they tried to visit.", "Read my response to OP.

She should know better than to expect to show up an hour before bedtime. Especially for op child to play with their cousins.", "You\u2019d figure at least the sil with kids would get it. When I had my first I lost a lot of time and energy trying to explain to my friends that they couldn\u2019t just show up whenever anymore and we had to be strict about our kid\u2019s schedule, dinner time, bedtime etc. good for you for not putting yourself through that particular hell.", "Best thing I ever did was stop expecting anything from my in-laws.

If they cared, they\u2019d be there. I\u2019d honestly just stop putting effort and energy into those relationships.

Then later found out that all of his family went to a festival that night literally 2 minutes down the road from us. No invite to us, we only know because niece posted about it. So yeah, we definitely went into the conversation hurt and defensive.", "I also live away from family and it's a challenge to try to see everyone- Everyone feels like they should be a priority, you have to work around everyone's schedule, not to mention dealing with your own kids. It's so much easier when my family all meets in one place and I can see everyone.", "You're exactly right. We're an afterthought. They spent the time they knew we were off work with people they prioritized over us. Had they only been in town on days we worked, I could have worked with them and kept baby up a little later and dealt with the loss of sleep it would entail. But I'm not willing to do that for someone who has shown that we are not a priority to them.", "That additional information was helpful.
