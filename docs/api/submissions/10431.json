This is creepy and weird. \n\n>He says that he doesn't care\n\nThat's a problem as he is openly dismissive of your feelings.", "NTA. Watching it is one thing. Having it as a full on screensaver in the middle of the living room, is something else. \n\nBut the most bothersome part is how he says he doesn't care about how you feel about that, if you ask me.", "Nta lmao, don't watch hentai in the living room if your partner does not like it. It is supposed to be that easy. Time for some ultimatums imo.", "NTA\n\nCommon rooms should be kept comfortable for both partners.", " NtA. There is a diffeernce between liking this stuff, and putting it on full display. Him saying he doesn't care that it bothered you completely disregards your feelings and does not bode well. Time to deck out the rest of the living room in cute My Little Pony merch, or put a calendar with hunky guys up in the bedroom, see how he reacts (note: thiy is petty and not thr correct approach, but still hilarious to me).", "NTA.  If he doesn't care about your feeling enough to change this, he isn't worth your time in a relationship.", "NTA. \n\nIt is creepy and weird. He clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit about that boundary you\u2019re trying to create. It\u2019s completely reasonable for you to ask him to change it when it\u2019s the first thing you see in a public space. Does he enjoy that it makes you uncomfortable?", "NTA. Listen, im a big computer guy in my 40s. Have been since I was a kid on a commodore 64. That being said, if he wants explicit screen savers (which dont have any purpose) he should pick ones that a guest that comes over wouldnt look twice at when seeing. There is no need for pornographic screensavers in a public room.   \n\n\nI dont think its creepy or weird to like what he likes. It is however creepy and weird to display it to guests or strangers that might come into the house.", "NTA what you described can be considered pornographic to many people. Not everyone is comfortable with that. Unfortunately, all you can do is express that discomfort, and see if he will at least turn the monitors off while not using it.", "Euhhhh this made me cringe so hard he\u2019s 40. And I\u2019m praying he dosent refer to himself as \u201cweeb\u201d this is why I don\u2019t tell people i watch anime\ud83d\udc80", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s creepy. And he is 100% pushing your boundaries. \n\nI don\u2019t know many women who want a heaving panting screensaver playing non stop looking at me while I watching Greys Anatomy on the TV. \n\nYuck!\n\nNo!\n\nNo way!", "NTA and it is inconsiderate and rude (and frankly tacky) of him to have these photos in the living room - the most public room - when you've told him they make you uncomfortable. He said he \"doesn't care\" so why is he unwilling to modify his choices for you? \n\nIf it were his private office, that would be a completely separate situation.", "I'm the type to really not give a shit about this at all, like if someone has animated lewd anime girl stuff going on in their home office then I say go hogwild, but I don't think it's great for a shared area of the house. Like, there's a time and a place, man. And in particular, if you're like \"I don't want that in the shared space\" and he simply doesn't care, that's rude.\n\nNTA.", "NTA change the screensaver to a gif of cute buff gay men having really enthusiastic sex \n\n\\-signed, the gay dude that thinks this post is fucking hilarious", "If anybody is interested in what Smol and Weeb mean, I looked them up.  Smol means little in size and a weeb is someone who obsesses over Japanese culture.", "NTA. Gross.", "NTA\n\nNo porn in the shared spaces, unless you have explicit consent from everyone who uses those spaces.\n\nWhy on earth is he using a screensaver for? Black screens or sleep mode only.\n\nSo much wrong here.", "NTA- I might be old fashioned but at his age it seems so... pathetic.\nIf he doesn't get how inappropriate it is, I'd be a bit concerned about his general social awareness.", "NTA.  He can like whatever he likes, but he can\u2019t display that in a common room where any of my guests could see it.", "yeah NTA. this seems like behaviour you grow out of once you get in a relationship/move in with somebody... i would be uncomfortable too.", "Info: You say it's in the living room.... Is this your house??? His house??? or a shared house?", "NTA - This is sexual harassment to anyone who walks into your home and doesn't want to be subjected to sexual imagery without their explicit consent. I'd insist he moves the computer to somewhere move private or put the computer in sleep mode until a password is typed in to wake it up. I also wouldn't be okay with porn flashing on my partners screen. This is hentai imagery.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe whole situation is extremely cringe, but if it's his place he has the right to put whatever he wants on his monitors. That being said, you're completely valid in being repulsed by basically softcore hentai in a common area, and it's his disregard of your feelings that puts him in AH territory. I think the people claiming it's sexual harassment are overreacting tho.\n\nI also love anime and gaming, but the lewd wallpapers and gifs are super corny lol. Even in private settings, but that's just my opinion.", "NTA, enjoy life with a weirdo that will creep everyone out, figure out how you\u2019ll be a part of that", "Nta. I too find it so weird for people to be fixated on 2d images of women (half of which are either canonically children or made to look like children).", "NTA\n\nNo matter your age and how much you love gaming some things are disturbing. This is one of them. \n\nAlso I can't even think why he feels it's okay to have that playing constantly in your house while you eat your lunch or watch a movie....", "NTA, and it\u2019s debatable if he is or isn\u2019t. I get that it\u2019s his \u201cthing\u201d, but here are some questions I have:\n\n1. Does he absolutely refuse to change the screens to something less lewd?\n\n2. Is he willing to move his setup to where it\u2019s less in your face?\n\n3. Does this cause significant fights for you that end in resentment/stalemates/etc?\n\n4. If 1 and 3 are yes, and two is no: is this a dealbreaker for you?", "NTA it's definitely creepy and weird especially if this princess is princess zelda considering she's a minor, the only other video game princesses i can think of from the top of my head are from mario and at least to my knowledge they aren't sexualized nearly as often as zelda", "NTA.  I would have walked away immediately, and I am a guy.  \n\nThere is a time and place for porn, and it is not on your best high-def setup while you have a date to watch Netflix.", "NTA im a weeb but i got no balls to put up a wallpaper like that infront of people", "NTA. Start sticking up hyper sexualised pics of men and see what effect that has?", "NTA. I'm on the same page as you. I like anime and I don't mind lewd artwork, but I can't stand the super corny and uncanny anime softcore drawings. The ones where it's so overly hypersexualized it becomes comical. Those ones are difficult to perceive as 'sensual and artistic', and come off as gaudy and unrefined to me. Having that on the big screen right in your face 'cheapens' the look of the room.\n\nIf it's like those poorly animated avatars/banners available in the Steam points shop --- you know the ones where the anime girl's disproportionate body is contorted to show perfectly-spherical cleavage and ass at the same time that either violently jiggle or float with \"balloon boob physics\", and she's making an exaggerated face where it's past the point of ahegao and into \"brain damaged\" territory -- then I especially agree with your sentiment. It's cringe\n\nMaybe to explain it to him better you can say:\n\nit's not necessarily distasteful in the sense of being a prude; it's distasteful because it's just fucking ugly. It looks ridiculous because of the quality, *not* the smut content. There are better looking lewd screensavers out there.  Maybe you can help him select a new one.", "INFO: Are you sharing this place with him?

Fill the whole apartment with such pillows.", "INFO: I'd need to know what you consider to be \"tasteful? Semi-appropriate?\" it could be creepy or you could be a prude, I have no reference.", "NAH. Since he calls himself a weeb, I think it's central to his identity, which is why he chose this hill to die on. However, also feel free to put up whatever you like in the living room regardless of what he says.", "NAH. The guy likes what he likes. He\u2019s allowed to like it if he wants, and you\u2019re allowed to dislike it.\n\nDoes he pay the rent? Then you need to deal with it or leave him if it bothers you that much. The only thing I can say is bad is **if** he leaves the monitors on the screensavers while company is over. If they\u2019re on in the comfort of his own home when no one else but you and him are there, then there\u2019s no problem.\n\nUltimately you\u2019re uncomfortable and it isn\u2019t up to him to change his behavior or what he likes to make you comfortable.
