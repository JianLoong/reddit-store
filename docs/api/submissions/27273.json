We have full time daycare, during the day, and he works from home.\n\nThe other night, we had a date night planned. We were going to go out to dinner, then had plans to go to a bonfire with friends. \n\nWe got a sitter. I got all done up. Dinner started great, but hit a sour note when my husband made the comment that he was disappointed we weren\u2019t doing something more exciting. I took it to heart because I was excited for the night we\u2019d planned so I was moody and quiet. We were still in a tiff heading back home to change for the bonfire. When it came time to meet our friends, they said they were finishing dinner/having a drink or two at a nearby restaurant and asked us to join. My husband stated that he\u2019d rather take the time to take a nap, then he\u2019d meet us for the bonfire after. I did say I\u2019d prefer he come with, but he declined. So I went, had one drink, then came back to get him for the bonfire. He\u2019d texted while I was out and said he\u2019d thrown up, but still planned to go with to the bonfire. I got back to pick him up and asked if he still felt up to going to the bonfire and he said no. I asked if he wanted me to pick up the kids from the sitter, early, and get them to bed so he didn\u2019t have to while I was with our friends. His response was, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t really want to go get them.\u201d So I did go pick them up and brought them back and got them to bed. He was still distant, so I left to follow through with the original plans. I was out for 2.5hrs and got home before midnight. \n\nI took care of the kids for him to attend a golf tournament with his two guy friends for 9 hours the following day. \n\nWhen he got back from golfing, he expressed frustration that I\u2019d left him that night, stating that he\u2019d never leave me when I was sick, and that the point of the night wasn\u2019t to go see friends, it was to spend time together. I explained that I work, nonstop, and to me, getting out of our house, out of routine, and having time to laugh and joke with friends was important. I explained that I would have rather spent the time with him, but he never, at the time, indicated that he wanted the time together, he wasn\u2019t feeling great, and said at the time that he just wanted to go to bed. I had texted him several positive/caring messages while I was out, and got no response. \n\nHe encouraged me to make a post on AITA, because he insists that no \u201cgood\u201d wife would leave their sick husband to spend time with friends, when the plan was to spend the night together, saying I \u201cditched\u201d him. \n\nI said he should have expressed to me that the time together was important to him, and not been cold toward me, expecting me to abandon our previously-made plans and sit at home, again, then cover for his golf outing with friends, for nine hours, the following day.", "created_utc": 1695222536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16nnoj0/aita_for_leaving_my_sick_husband_to_spend_time/", "score": 475, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That sure was a fast stomach bug.", "NTA.  He wasn't sick.  He was well enough to go golfing the next day.  I highly doubt he even threw up and it was an excuse to not go to the bonfire.", "Well, since he suggested posting here, I am going with a strong NTA! You aren't a bad wife for going out for 2.5 hours. For the love of God, he threw up, he wasn't on his death bed. He wanted to take a nap and did so. If you were home, would he have not napped?  Was he going to stay up & make it exciting at home or what? Working full time & studying for a doctorate is time consuming alone on top of having a family. \n\nThe same way a lot of people will say I'm not a mind reader also goes for you. He should have said I'd like for you to stay home with me or whatever. I also agree that getting one night out of the house, away from the kids, having a date night and having some time with friends is VERY healthy for all concerned. I would also think your husband would want you to have a moment of fun and want to see you have a good time since you do work so hard, but apparently not.  He then whined/complained about wanting to do something more exciting but went home to take a nap. This was, unfortunately, a no-win situation for you no matter what you did. \n\nApparently, he lived thru his upset stomach, and got a day out with his friends, but somehow, some way you're TAH and a bad wife? Sigh\\~ NTA in my book. Good luck on your studies.", "NTA\n\nNot so sick he would cancel golf the next day, it seems. Throwing up is an odd one - usually a stomach bug lasts more than one night, even mild food poisoning would leave him too wobbly to golf the next day. Did he drink too much?\n\nSo if he were very unwell, might have deteriorated, needed watching in case he needed hospitalization, then yeah, you would be the AH in that situ. But you were confident enough that he wasn't that ill, and you were proven right. Without being there I can't be certain, but it doesn't sound like you were wrong here. I wonder how the evening went from his perspective, though?", "NTA.  \n\nSo- he wanted you to stay home and what?  Watch him sleep?  Is that his idea of quality time?  \n\nHe was \u201csick\u201d to the point where he felt you shouldn\u2019t have left him, but well enough that he was able to spend the entire next day golfing with his buddies?  Yeah, NO.  If he was truly sick, he would have needed more than a few hours of sleep to recover.  \n\nIf quality time was truly top of mind for him, he could have postponed his golf date and arranged a last minute sitter.  But he didn\u2019t.  Yet he wants to shame you for a few hours at a bonfire?    Also- at dinner whilst you were SPENDING quality time with him, he complained that it \u201cwasn\u2019t exciting\u201d.  \n \nYour husband is behaving like a child. He is complaining about YOUR choices / behavior, citing impact on your relationship (the whole \u201cwe need quality time\u201d argument) yet he didn\u2019t adjust HIS actions at all to address this need.   \n\nTo sum up, you had a few hours with friends; he had an entire day.  And he\u2019s annoyed with YOU?", "NTA. He's being moody and manipulative for no good reason. I'd maybe get it if he never got time to himself and he was jealous you did, but literally the next day he spends 9 hours at a gold tourney so it doesn't sound like he doesn't get time to himself or to do things he wants to do.\n\nif time together was so important he could have spent less time at the golf tournament the next day to make up for the fact that he ditched your plans the night before.", "Your husband was acting passive aggressively and likely manipulative-he was so sick he threw up and needed you, but not so sick to do a huge day trip with his friends the next day? How many days do you get to take with your friends where you drive hours away and do whatever you want? \n\nA \u201cgood\u201d husband would use his big boy voice and tell you what he wanted. A \u201cgood\u201d husband would understand that sometimes you need to socialize and break routine with what sounds like a hellish schedule. A \u201cgood\u201d husband would have picked to spend the next day with you instead of his friends. \n\nNTA\n\nSince your husband was the one who recommended you post this, I hope you show him all the replies", "NTA - if time together was so important, why does he get to make golf plans the following day?  How sick was he really if he went golfing the next day?  When you are working shifts and working on your PhD, time to decompress with friends is essential.  Both your needs for friend time were met, and that is what was important.  He needs to get over himself about you needing to care for him when he has a tummy ache.", "NTA, he's just being jealous and probably lied about the throwing up to guilt trip you because he was in tatrum mode.", "Hey, OP\u2019s husband. A man cold won\u2019t kill you. And if you want something from your wife, use your big boy words. Expecting her to read your mind is ridiculous. And if you could golf for 9 hours the next day, you weren\u2019t that sick \n\nOP, NTA. Try a spa weekend. Let hubby figure out how to parent", "NTA. I'm not believing he was sick. He needs to speak up and communicate *before* plans are already in motion. Why bring up on the day after that 'date night isn't for seeing friends' rather than before when planning was taking place? Then complaining about not doing something \"more exciting\"? Let me guess: He didn't plan the date but let you take on the mental load of planning? Or he just gave you a generic 'yeah whatever's fine' response when you suggested things? He can't complain and get a tummy ache if he isn't going to act like an adult and use his words effectively and collaborate actively in planning date nights. And by effectively, I mean being clear and not just hoping the breadcrumb hints get picked up.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like he sabotaged your night out. It sounds like he is trying to isolate you from friends. \n\nThe only thing that maybe could have been different is just getting the kids to bed without asking (when partner is sick) but I honestly don't know that he was sick. It just sounds like he's trying to control and isolate you. \n\nHe can go out golfing for nine hours the next day? He can make plans with you and friends, then emotionally sabotage it last minute? He can claim he threw up and wants to sleep, but despite your giving him that down time and taking some much needed time for yourself, too, he can act cold then call you cold even though you checked in with caring messages? Naw. Not cool. You both need time with friends. His taking care of the kids some evenings while you work doesn't change that, and it sounds like you are taking care of them on weekends a lot more. If I had to guess, you probably do a lot of the mental load for the family, too. If he wanted to enjoy time with you, he could have made that effort the night before and helped plan a different night together that he'd find more \"exciting\" in the future.", "NTA\n\nHis man-cold excuse for wanting you to wait on him hand and foot instead of having a full night out is sad. Let\u2019s recap:\n\n1. Husband mentioned he wanted to do something more exciting than dinner. Spoiled the mood for you.\n\n2. Friends you\u2019re meeting later invite you for an impromptu drink (exciting!) and now he wants to go home for a nap? Did he mention he wasn\u2019t feeling well at this point? Doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\n3. You go out with the friends for one drink. He tells you he\u2019s thrown up but still wants to do the bonfire. You come get him, he decides he just doesn\u2019t want to do anything, including caring for his own kids.\n\n4. You rally and try to salvage the night, picking up the kids, putting them to bed and then going to enjoy the bonfire.\n\n5. Next day, he\u2019s fine and going to a 9 hr golf tournament with his buddies. And he\u2019s acting like a pouty child because you didn\u2019t stay home with him instead of enjoying the night out you were previously both looking forward to.\n\nYou have three children, not two.\n\nEdit to add: if the sickness part was made up to \u201ctest\u201d you in someway, that\u2019s also passive-aggressive AF.", "So, first he was pissy because he thought your plans for the evening weren't \"exciting\" enough? Then (conveniently whilst you're absent) he apparently throws up (once? For no apparent reason?), but says your plans are still on, presumably so you come back to get him, rather than staying out. Then, when you arrive, he decides plans are off and becomes distant and doesn't use his words. You continue with plans, whilst ensuring he's not bothered with childcare.\n\nHe's then mysteriously well enough to go out play golf for *nine hours* the next day, but decided you are at fault for not prioritising him the night before?\n\nThere was really *no* pleasing him yesterday, was there? Why is he determined to find fault? This smells like someone with something else underneath, starting fights over nothing, desperate to cast you as a villain for something.\n\nNTA. But, why would he do that? Has he been more absent than usual? Is he often whining about what a 'good' wife would do? Has he complained about you working? Do you earn more?\n\nIt feels like he's either got a bee in his bonnet over gender roles, is overly stressed at work and is misdirecting, or his interest has strayed elsewhere and he's picking fights to make you the bad guy.", "NTA Well, he was not sick, he was not feeling well, and he was well enough next day to go golfing. You took care of the kids and let him sleep, I don't know what else you could do.", "NTA. He is not a child, and did not ask for you to stay or help him in any way. \n\nHe would rather take a nap than spend time with you and your friends??? I would feel slighted by that. \n\nThen he asks you to post on AITA? Nooooo, it was not like he was dying or even that sick.", "NTA\n\nHe didn't want to go out at all and is now trying to guilt trip you into not going out next time either by saying you're not a good wife.", "NTA your husband is just a dick, funny how he was apparently so sick the night before he felt you should\u2019ve stayed home but yet wasn\u2019t sick the next morning so he could golf for 9 hours.", "Nta. Absolutely *not* the asshole.", "NTA.\n\nGrown people can care for themselves when they are sick. If he felt so ill that he needed supervision, he should have said that. And if he felt well enough that he wanted to hang out with you but not go out, he should have said that too. \n\nHe started the night by putting down your quality time- when he had NOT proposed something more exciting himself- but expected you to read his mind that he wanted time together, after putting down and then declining quality time together. \n\nHe also managed to get it together for 9 hours of golf. So husband, I hope you are reading this- if you want quality time, plan it and show up for it as your best self. If you aren't feeling well that's cool, but either say you need help or let your wife have some fun while you sleep. And you owe her 9 hours of time off since you got yourself together for golf after putting down a date with her.", "NTA", "NTA....wasn't too sick to go golfing", "Am I allowed to add context on his behalf?\n\n- I should clarify that he wasn\u2019t unwilling to get the kids! Just didn\u2019t want to have to go get them later if I was going to leave him, not feeling well. \n- I believe he was equally disappointed in my reaction to his comment at dinner and had, himself, suggested several other really adorable date plans, that I\u2019d declined, but ultimately, we made our plans for the night together.\n- He definitely wasn\u2019t drunk. Not a drinker. He had one glass of wine with dinner. I think he really just had a weird bug, but it was nothing too serious. He\u2019d been saying he felt \u201coff\u201d the whole day, and the day prior, but hadn\u2019t been like, bedridden or out of then normal routine. \n- He\u2019s a great dad and does a LOT of the parental tasks and daily household tasks even though I\u2019m definitely the \u201cmental load\u201d carrier. He works really hard. \n- We do have a very loving relationship, and struggle with communication at times (clearly.) I think he really did intend to have the quality time with me. \n- My goal on this thread is to determine if I was in the wrong, because he\u2019s repeatedly said my decision to leave him was selfish. Given that the plans with our mutual friends were made in advance, with his agreement, I guess I didn\u2019t feel that way. \n- I didn\u2019t mind having our kids the following day! I don\u2019t get a lot of quality time with them either, so I was more than happy to have them while he golfed!\n\nI may have opened a can of worms here.", "Raise your hand if you don\u2019t believe he was sick the night of the bonfire.", "NTA\n\nHe just throw up and went to bed. Critical situation? Nope!\n\nYour husband practice golf or opera? Because he sounds like a diva to me.\n\nTake care.", ">He encouraged me to make a post on AITA, because he insists that no \u201cgood\u201d wife would leave their sick husband to spend time with friends, when the plan was to spend the night together, saying I \u201cditched\u201d him.\n\nI guess he doesn't spend enough time on AITA because not only will we vote for NTA, but emphasize that he is the AH, and we will give you things to consider that you may not have thought of. Wow, he did one thing right by you this weekend...\n\nGood luck with everything!", "NTA. what are you supposed to do? Just sit and watch him while he pukes and/or sleeps? He's being unreasonable. \"a good wife\" oh please. then I guess HIS 9 hour golf outing the following day makes him not a \"good husband\" but I doubt he'd ever see it that way", "NTA\n\nHe wasn't feeling well, he didn't go. Why does he expect you to stay beside him all the time? He should just go to them and sleep it off, you don't have to be there for that.\n\nI'd never ask my partner to not go out with friends just because I'm not feeling well.\n\nThe only thing where I think you're an AH is that you got moody throughout the whole dinner just because he said he'd rather be doing something more exciting, what the hell is up with that?\n\nYou two need to learn to better communicate with each other.", "NTA he is a grown man who barfed once. He was able to golfing the next day for how many hours??\n\nYou deserve a better husband.", "NTA you are allowed to have a social life outside of him. Would have been great if he was there, you took care of the kids checked his emotional needs and made use of the time where he said he wanted to sleep. \n\nAre you supposed to spend time with a sleeping person??", "NTA\n\nYou gave him plenty of opportunity to use his words and his texting fingers. But he expected you to read his mind.  That's never going to turn out well.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe needs to get over himself.", "Hahahahahhahah is he being serious?\n\nSo he was well enough to spend 9 hours playing golf? I call bullshit on him even being sick at all.\n\nHe was bored at dinner and He didn't want to go to a bonfire. That's all.\n\nNTA\n\nBut your husband sure is.", "NTA. He felt well enough to ditch you to play golf the next day!", "INFO \n\nWhat is your husband's job and educational level? Is he perhaps resentful you might outshine him? He may not say it out loud but let these little side quibbles out instead.", "NTA no sympathy for him from me. It was hardly vital and a doc would probably tell him \"go home, hydrate and get into bed\" which is probably what he did anyway.", "he was a poor communicator\n\nNTA", "I really hope you update us with his response to this post being overwhelmingly on your side. NTA.", "NTA let\u2019s pretend for a second that your husband was actually sick. You did everything to make it easier for him. Got the kids and got them in bed. He expected you to then do what? Sit around and watch him be sick? On one of your few nights off from and incredibly demanding and stressful job and one of the few times you have plans away from being mom? Why? What on earth would that have done? He\u2019s a grown man and knows how to lay in bed to get better on his own. \n\nNow let\u2019s switch back to reality. Your husband sabotaged your night. From beginning to end. I\u2019ve had food poisoning. It\u2019s throwing up all night. It\u2019s not being able to move the next day. It\u2019s your stomach being twisted and fragile for the next few days or longer. It\u2019s not one convenient throw up when your spouse is out. It\u2019s not playing golf and walking around for 9 hours. He was pouty at the beginning of the date and then faking sick for attention and to take away your night. \n\nHe is a narcissistic manipulator whose gaslighting you. Run girl run! If not for yourself then for your children. Be a good wife and get the F out of there.", "NTA\n\nIf your husband spent the entire next day in bed sick, then you'd royally suck. But, he wasn't sick.

And if your husband is complaining about not spending any quality time you might have to reflect on it and have an honest conversation with him. He should also not be going on 9hr golf trip", "NTA\nHe wasn't that sick if he went golfing the next day.

So he played sick to see if you'd stay home and then get mad when you didn't.  All he had to say was that he wasn't feeling well and would really love to spend time with you so maybe you could both just curl up on the couch and watch a movie together.

Time away from your children, responsibilities and routine is crucial. \n\nNTA. Your husband tried to manipulate you and it didn't work. Then he attempted to try to turn the tables on you.

I would be extremely upset at my husband for lying to me and not communicating what he wanted. You both really need to work on your communication or your relationship will fall apart even if you guys resolve this. You should have communicated to him that it really hurt your feelings that you took the time to plan this date out of your busy schedule and you were really looking forward to it. And he should have been honest and said I want to just stay home and bang all night while the kids are at the sitters because I assume that's really what he wanted. You guys both need to work on being 100% honest with each other. Really you will both be a thousand times happier. You can't expect him to be a mind reader and he can't expect you to be a mind reader. If you love your husband and he loves you you're going to have to sit down and have an honest conversation about all of your feelings and his feelings. Also you could have just snuck off to bang somewhere crazy like in a bathroom or your car the second he said he was hoping for a more exciting date I think that's what he meant honestly. But he should have asked you if that's what he was really hoping for. But to me it seems obvious that he's really attracted to you and was hoping for a different sort of date night.

We have full time daycare, during the day, and he works from home.\n\nThe other night, we had a date night planned. We were going to go out to dinner, then had plans to go to a bonfire with friends. \n\nWe got a sitter. I got all done up. Dinner started great, but hit a sour note when my husband made the comment that he was disappointed we weren\u2019t doing something more exciting. I took it to heart because I was excited for the night we\u2019d planned so I was moody and quiet. We were still in a tiff heading back home to change for the bonfire. When it came time to meet our friends, they said they were finishing dinner/having a drink or two at a nearby restaurant and asked us to join. My husband stated that he\u2019d rather take the time to take a nap, then he\u2019d meet us for the bonfire after. I did say I\u2019d prefer he come with, but he declined. So I went, had one drink, then came back to get him for the bonfire. He\u2019d texted while I was out and said he\u2019d thrown up, but still planned to go with to the bonfire. I got back to pick him up and asked if he still felt up to going to the bonfire and he said no. I asked if he wanted me to pick up the kids from the sitter, early, and get them to bed so he didn\u2019t have to while I was with our friends. His response was, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t really want to go get them.\u201d So I did go pick them up and brought them back and got them to bed. He was still distant, so I left to follow through with the original plans. I was out for 2.5hrs and got home before midnight. \n\nI took care of the kids for him to attend a golf tournament with his two guy friends for 9 hours the following day. \n\nWhen he got back from golfing, he expressed frustration that I\u2019d left him that night, stating that he\u2019d never leave me when I was sick, and that the point of the night wasn\u2019t to go see friends, it was to spend time together. I explained that I work, nonstop, and to me, getting out of our house, out of routine, and having time to laugh and joke with friends was important. I explained that I would have rather spent the time with him, but he never, at the time, indicated that he wanted the time together, he wasn\u2019t feeling great, and said at the time that he just wanted to go to bed. I had texted him several positive/caring messages while I was out, and got no response. \n\nHe encouraged me to make a post on AITA, because he insists that no \u201cgood\u201d wife would leave their sick husband to spend time with friends, when the plan was to spend the night together, saying I \u201cditched\u201d him. \n\nI said he should have expressed to me that the time together was important to him, and not been cold toward me, expecting me to abandon our previously-made plans and sit at home, again, then cover for his golf outing with friends, for nine hours, the following day.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It sounds like you planned it. The partner who doesn\u2019t plan the date night does not get to complain about the plan.

So being moody that you didn't read his mind for doing something MORE EXCITING . He knew it won't happen since you already had plans which wasn't about spending alone time.

He was complaining about going through with the first part of the plans you'd made. He didn't appear to think he was more than a little sick. He didn't show any sign, at the time, that he wanted you to stay with him. He was planning to go to bed and sleep. Nowhere in any of this do I get 'I just want to spend time with you'. In fact, his behaviour fully indicates the opposite. \n\nHe knew what the plans were. You communicated clearly that you were going to continue with the original plans. The only thing he actually seemed to push for a change on was bringing the kids home early. And even that wasn't actually communicated, just implied, because he never actually said 'go get them now', just that he didn't want to pick them up himself. \n\nIt sounds like his plan was to go to bed, have you get the kids early, then you stay home with the kids instead of going out with friends. Nowhere in anything he did or said that night indicates he was going to do anything but sleep, so this can't have been about spending time with you.\n\nHe then disappeared for most of the day the next day, way longer than your less than 3 hours. This adds to the fact he didn't appear to want to spend time with you. If that had been the issue, why didn't he say it that morning and cancel his plans so you could get the time then instead? \n\nTo me, this reads like he was trying to passively force you to cancel your plans to wait on him hand and foot and deal with the kids. He obviously wasn't all that sick if he could go out for so long just fine the next morning. And now he's angry because you went through with the pre-made plans. He doesn't care that he never told you to stay home with him, or that you clearly told me you were still going out with the friends, he just cares that you didn't drop everything for him without him having to be the 'bad guy' by telling you that's what he wanted. \n\nIt actually sounds like if he'd said 'I don't feel well, can you stay and catch up with your friends tomorrow instead' that you'd have stayed home. Or if he'd said 'I want to spend the night just the two of us'. \n\nThe problem here isn't you, it's his refusal to communicate what he wants but expecting you to know anyway. It's him acting one way but expecting you to think it means the opposite. Everything he did that night indicates he wanted to be at home alone sleeping. And now he's saying he wanted to spend time with you, the complete opposite of what his behaviour was communicating.", "OP Nta! But tell us your AH husband\u2019s response to this thread!
