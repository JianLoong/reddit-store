These are not isolated incidents; this class is the only one that\u2019s ever given me this problem, and I know it involves multiple students.

How are you expected to get evidence? Are they giving permission for hidden cameras or tracking devices? Maybe \"thief paint\" to leave a trace on the offender's hands? Having the school resource officer sit in and watch the class? Police reports and investigations followed by charges?", "NTA. They are not entitled to a holiday party.

Lock away your things to prevent stealing, write a list of assignments that need to be got through, have a three strikes rule for the really bad stuff (back-talking, etc.).

Is it fair to the students in class who haven\u2019t given you grief? They have had to suffer with these other kids and now also don\u2019t get a break or fun when their peers from other classes are. Giving some a pass can feel like favoritism and may get you in a sticky situation with administrators and parents. Sometimes kids suck, sometimes it\u2019s because home is hard, sometimes it\u2019s because they suck. Having things stolen from you is 100% not okay. However, have you had conversations with the suspects? Like one on one to find out if more is going on? You totally may have but there may be a lot more than meets the eye going on. My favorite teachers were ones who tried to understand and help me see my potential. Maybe try and ask the class if they think they deserve a party and if so, explain why they think they have earned it. Maybe this can help them realize the grief they have given you.
