Please help me see if I was indeed being an arse. Thank you.\n\nI (30F) saw an old high school friend (Anne - 30F) the other day at work (I'm a doctor and her friend has been in my care for quite some time now. After Anne knew who I was through her friend, she said she wanted to come and say hi). \n\nWith Anne's persistence, I agreed to grab a cup of coffee with her over my break. We talked about the old days and all. She said she had a husband and two kids. After Anne asked, I told her I now had a wife and a 4 year old daughter. \n\nAt first, she was very excited, asked me if she could see some pictures of us so I showed her a few. After that, she laughed and told me how ironic this whole thing was given the fact that I used to bully her back in the day. \n\nBack in high school, Anne was more or less of a tomboy. I was a cheerleader. I didn't know any better and I used to be quite cold towards her. I unfortunately didn't say anything when my friends would talk about her sexuality. \n\nThey used to tease her for being 'gay' even though she wasn't. I went along with it and didn't say anuthing. I also was rude and judgemental. I'm not at all proud of the way I was. Quite the opposite actually. However, I never made any comments myself. I was a silent bystander which is also horrible but I just wanted to clarify.\n\nI said I was deeply sorry for not being a good friend back then, and I apologised. I also told her I was a confused closeted girl who had no idea what she wanted. (I didn't know what I wanted pretty much until I met my wife) Later, I said I wish I could take it back and make it up to her.\n\nShe told me she got an apology only after she found me and asked me why I hadn't tried to apologise through social media. I don't use social media much . I simply said I was sorry and didn't know any better. And I said I honestly didn't think she'd want to hear about any of this.\n\nShe called me an entitled AH who could get whatever she wanted from life. Anne said I should have apologised long ago. She then left and told me she genuinely hoped I was a better human because my wife and daughter deserved the person I was back then.\n\nWas I indeed an AH?", "created_utc": 1677755601, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g07ev/aita_for_not_apologising_to_a_girl_i_used_to_bully/", "score": 799, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Clearly, she wanted an apology. But that's a fucked up way to go about getting one. \n\nBut what's especially frustrating here is that you *did* apologise to her...you explained that you were a stupid kid and you said sorry. \n\nI don't really understand why she expected more of you than that. \n\nExpecting you to get in touch with her out of nowhere to apologise is not a realistic expectation.  \n\nI was bullied relentlessly in high school, but if any of my bullies reached out to me on social media out of the blue, I'd be like 'fuck that'. \n\nHer behaviour was deceitful and weird, and then to insult you even when she was the one who asked you to hang out and you did actually apologise when she asked you to.\n\nIf she disliked you that much, then she could have no other reason to ask you to hang out with her other than to be a dick to you and make you feel shitty. \n\nNah, she's the asshole here, not you.", "I'm gonna go with NTA. You apologized when you two met again, that's good.\n\nHer being upset that you didn't reach out to her right away to apologize is a bit weird.\n\nHell, a lot of people *do not like it* when a bully tries to insert themselves into their lives, years later, just to absolve themselves, just 'cause they want an \"I forgive you\", because it just opens up old wounds.", "In case I missed something, this woman sought you out to catch up and have a cup of coffee, and then told you that you bullied her in high school. When you apologized, she told you it wasn\u2019t good enough? What else does she want from you? NTA.", "NTA.\n\nMost of us walk away from school and don't keep in touch. It seems odd of her to expect you to seek her out specifically to apologise. The normal thing to do there really is to just sort of, move on? Sure, reaching out to someone you used to bully would be a very good thing to do, but she may well have also never wanted to hear from you again and so reaching out wouldn't have had a good impression.\n\nI was bullied at school a bit and honestly if any of my former bullies dropped me a message on Instagram to apologise, I'd probably just ignore it. I think I'd genuinely prefer to never hear from any of them again. Like what are they expecting? It's not like we're gonna become friends now. It makes zero difference in my life whether they message me or not. I genuinely don't care. It was so many years ago now, I'm over it and I've moved on with my life.\n\nSo yea, reaching out earlier on might have been a good thing to do, but I don't think it makes you an asshole for not reaching out sooner. It just makes you...normal.", "NTA. Anne needs help to get over her past, not to berate you. You apologized, end of story.", "NTA\n\nThis wasn't a friendly cup of coffee, this was an AMBUSH.", "NTA\n\nWhile it might still be hurtful, she got out of high school 12 years ago. If she really had a problem and wanted to discuss it with you she shouldn't have invited you out for a \"friendly lunch\" and then tried to back you into a corner to feel guilty.", "You're NTA. You did apologize. The fact that you did not seek her out on social media to do it doesn't make you an A-H. Her part in this conversation screams that she deliberately set this up just so she could lash out at you for things that happened over a decade ago. I wonder if she seeks out all her other high school classmates for the same purpose.", "NTA- you apologised sincerely and clearly feel terrible about things you let happen around you. \nWhat more does she want?\n\nHaver any of the others reached out to her in the past to apologise?", "Unpopular opinion but to me NAH.\n\nYou apologized. And seems like a more sincere apology than something I could've given under the circumstances. It is also true that trying to track her and inserting yourself in her life would probably have done more harm than good. This is not \"my name is earl\". \n\nBut also it's within her right whether or not to choose to accept your apology. It's her prerogative whether she forgives you. \n\nSometimes there's wrongs we cannot undo, there's things we cannot unbreak.", "NTA. Sounds like you did apologize to me. And she wasnt expecting it and still wanted the scene she had in her head you deserved. Not your problem. \nAs weird as it sounds I'm actually cool with a bully from my past who was like you..only sometimes she did say things too. She just never put hands on me like her friends. She ended up being my bestfriends bestfriend and neighbor when we were adults. She was so excited to see me and so shocked when I asked why she wanted to be nice to me now. She apologized,  said she was stupid and insecure..she just wanted her friends/bullies to like her too. I asked her if she wanted to smoke a blunt and we talked about our kids for awhile. Now I'd consider her a friend. She owned what she did and apologized. And is a diffrent person who had actually had my back quite a few times when needed. \nIt dosent always turn out this way, theres others I wouldn't forgive if they apologized but...sometimes kids are stupid and thoughtless and cruel. I know i myself was at times in diffrent ways.  I think those who genuinely mean it when they are contrite deserve a second chance to be a decent human. Without that..there probably wouldn't be alot of decent humans out there.", "NTA. I don't know how you could have handled it better. \n\nSometimes people take the most offence not on the bullies, but on the silent participants. I sort of get it, they are the ones that could help if they were the magical movie protagonists that can put the bully in their place. \n\nThat's not certain though, people stay silent because they don't want to be the one on the receiving end and holding this against the silent participant isn't helping anyone. This is kids were are talking about afterall. Adults we can hold accountable up to a point.\n\nHer comment sounds like she could really use some therapy. Or this is the first time she has opened up about it and she might even regret saying that now that she got it off her chest.", "I'm gunna say NTA. You were an asshole for being that kind of person back then, but one doesn't change overnight and after high school people drift apart from each other and from who they were. Probably you never gave it another thought, and while that's too bad, it's not asshole level.   At least when the memory of it all popped back into your life, you had the maturity to understand how bad you had been and apologize.", "NTA\n\nYou apologised. She then asked why you didn't apologise to her online and then gave out to you because she perceived you to have had it easy. She needs therapy.\n\nPerhaps it's because I was bullied by so many people that they became a hostile amorphous blob or because I'm autistic but when bullies have apologised to me I've not really cared about the apology and cared more about changes they've made to their behaviour. It's scary to stand out as a teen and no one knows exactly why one behaves poorly but it's usually through fear of becoming the target.", "NTA, she basically ambushed you. Even if you did use social media a lot, why would you go out of your way to message a girl you went to school with over a decade ago who probably didn't cross your mind until very recently? This was a self-serving stunt and she is TA.", "NTA\n\nWe can't walk around apologizing to anyone we realize hurted when we were kids. Kids sometimes do super fucked up things. It's not good, and it's absolutely something we have to apologize for. WHEN it happens. Not years later as adults. We are not nearly the same people at the age of 30 as we were at the age of 16.\n\nYou did your part apologizing in person when you two met, doing it through social media several years after it happened would've been unnecessary.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA. \n\nLook, no one ever has to accept an apology. But when the behavior is in the past and not ongoing, you can either accept the apology or not. You don\u2019t get to keep berating someone for an apology already given or act like it doesn\u2019t count. And here, she basically browbeat you into meeting up with her and demanded an apology with every intention of dismissing that apology when given. That\u2019s frankly bizarre behavior.", "I don't know how it's going to be perceived but I'd personally say NAH.\n\nIn your situation you couldn't apology through social media, not everyone wants to remember those kind of experiences, therefore you took a respectful approach not contacting Anne.\n\nAt the same time, I can see how Anne reacted, I can't blame her and at least she got an apology, I hope the best for you both.", "NTA - she\u2019s right you should have apologised a long time ago (if you were aware of your actions and their impact on their), but a late sincere apology is better than none. It sounds like she\u2019s taking it out on you for all the others who never apologised.", "NTA\n\nIf your story is true and you never actually never did the bullying, but just were a bystander, then it is fine. Being cold and not a good friend is not being an asshole in my opinion. You even apologized for not acting which wasn't even your duty. \n\nShe really needs therapy if this bothers her to this day, with or without apologies from her bullies.", "NTA. I don't understand people who think they're entitled to an apology from an adult for actions from childhood. Everyone has a rough time in school. Most people spend some amount of time on both sides of bullying.", "YTA. You were a bully. And you have a problem with accepting it. Stop all 'but's' and give her an unconditional apology. What you did is not apologize. You made excuses and invalidated her pain. You are AH. A huge one.", "This is unpopular  but I'm going to go with ESH. She ambushed you with this which isn't  cool and it was weird she expected you to contact  her out of the blue. I'm glad you apologized but let's be honest sorry doesn't  really do much. Idk why reddit  thinks a simple apology makes everything  okay because it doesn't.", "ESH\nProbably unpopular opinion. You were a bully OP and for that you will always suck to her. You are a person that caused her trauma that you have no idea how much it has affected her throughout her life. That earlier apology was probably something that could have helped her a lot. And now you come complaining that your past actions have consequences in her lashing out at you. Can you really blame her?", "NTA, sje invited you for a drink of coffee or whatever under false pretences and then ambushed you about the passed, which you apologised over.", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m calling bullshit on her. She was fishing for an apology so she could make you feel bad when you did.", "NTA - sounds like she just wanted you to publicly humiliate yourself. Social media - seriously! Talk about entitled! Love your self-reflection and that you took responsibility for your actions (or non-actions). Thank you for sharing this.", "NTA Clearly, she was after more than an apology, since... she got that. Probably money.", "How could you be \"rude and judgemental\" if you were simply a \"silent bystander?\"\n\nLike you realize that people who weren't bullies don't get randomly accused of being a bully and years later have people from their childhood bring it up...right?\n\nThat doesn't happen to people that weren't bullies.\n\nYTA. Both for expecting that your apology had to be accepted...and then for coming to Reddit and lying to all of us by denying that you actually were a bully.", "Yta you were a bully.", "NTA. Honestly, sounds like she came over just to berate you and ruin your day. The comment she made is something you would think of after festering for a while not in the moment. Dont feel bad because nothing you would have done in the past nor present would have been good enough for her. If anything you should feel bad for her since she seemly cant let go of the past.", "NTA. You apologised not only for being a bystander, but also for what the other girls did in a way. But even after you apologised, Anne still didn't accept your apology. Not only that but why, after all these years, would you search for someone's social media? It's a bit creepy tbh.\n\nOP's NTA.

That's not much of an apology.", "Exactly this. You apologized when pressed in person, and that's understandable.

It just wasn't as important to you as fitting in with your friends. Like, how hard is it to say \"yanno, I was wrong then and it wasn't okay. I made bad choices and I'm sorry for the pain it caused you\"?", "You really don\u2019t think Anne was a complete asshole in this situation? She ambushed OP for an apology. After getting the apology Anne says it should have happened a long time ago and proceeds to insult the wife and daughter. Just because someone was bullied as a child doesn\u2019t give them the moral high ground. In fact saying an apology should have happened a long time when you get it automatically makes you an asshole", "Lots of people never called me a dyke at school, but they stood around and laughed when other people did and didn't try to stop it, and that's tacit participation in the bullying. I've been in therapy for years over a self esteem problem and social anxiety I developed from the same kind of bullying in school. Sure, I don't chase my bullies down for apologies (because fuck them), but that shit bothers people their whole lives.", "You realize that the reason \"everyone has a rough time in school\" is literally because of this exact mindset of *not* expecting bullies to apologize for their behavior later on...right?", "And she even got the apology, heartfelt it seems, and was still an AH.", "She's not in OPs life anymore. OP doesn't need to beg for forgiveness on their hands and knees, because of how they acted as a kid. This woman is living in the past.", "Um, OP did apologize. You think it wasn't good enough because she provided the context behind it? Context is good.", "So what else was OP supposed to do?", "I'm kinda with you here, yeah, she did kind of ambush her, which is kinda not fair. On the other hand, homophobic bullying during school is not necessarily a small thing in another person's life and it might warrant a lot more than a pressed \"I'm sorry you felt that way\". Personally, I grew from a tomboy into an anxious butch lesbian. Everyone called me \"dyke\" at school constantly and that made accepting my sexuality and presentation very difficult. I internalized their homophobia and directed it at myself. I self harmed over it, and spent years trying to be someone I wasn't. I developed social anxiety in junior high and high school that persists in my mid thirties. I didn't come out until mid university because of it,and it severely impacted my self esteem. I don't know if OP really understands the impacts of her behaviour when she was younger. At the same time, for me, anyone who called me Dyke in high school is a complete write off, even if I proudly wear the label now. I understand looking for closure, but what can you expect from high school bullies, really? Yeah ESH.", "This is very insightful", "It doesn't sound like Anne was bullied \"a bit\", it sounds like it was quite frequent and targeted. Also, everyone handles things like this differently. What doesn't affect you will fuck up others, and I'm sure things that wouldn't bother her would affect you deeply as well. That's just how humans are.", "She didn't bully her, and she's now a grown woman so maybe she should get over it instead of holding resentment forever", "Ok, so let me get this straight. \n\nWhat you think should have happened here is that OP should have reached out, at random, to someone they wronged in high school but haven't seen or heard from since, and said sorry I was kind of mean to you?? \n\nOr, sorry I didn't say anything when other people were kind of mean to you 15 years ago? \n\nThat isn't a realistic expectation. In a perfect world, nobody would be bullied, and if anyone was bullied, the bullies would always come around, realise their wrongdoings, and reach out to those they wronged and apologise. But this is not the world we live in. \n\nI mean, frankly, you've been a bit of a dick to me right now, your tone is aggressive and surly and you've accused me of placing conditions on people and whether or not they deserve an apology (which I haven't done, by the way) and I think I probably deserve an apology from you...but I ain't gonna get one, that much I know. \n\nMy expectations are realistic. I know that no matter what you say online, there will always be strangers on the internet that disagree and get pissy, and then choose to make aggressive comments. Should you be doing that? No, probably not. But this is the world we live in. \n\nAt the very least OP realises that they were a stupid kid who did a mean thing, and they apologised. That's better than the big old nothing most victims of bullying ever get. \n\nWhy tf would this girl want to hang out with someone that bullied them if not to fulfill some fantasy of calling them out and making them feel shitty? Just because she was bullied doesn't give her the right to engage in bullying behaviour now. Fighting fire with fire does not work. Especially when it is 15 years later and your lives and personalities are most likely vastly different. That makes her the AH, not OP.", "Yeah reading it back it does kind of seem like that.

Like...physically beaten up by groups of people to the point where I was hospitalised and those people were expelled from school, that level of bullying. \n\nIt has affected me hugely, it has shaped who I am as a person and yeah, sometimes I wish those people could see what they did and I wish they would apologise. \n\nBut, most days, I don't think about those people. \n\nThey mean nothing to me anymore. Giving them meaning in my life gives them power, because you can bet they ain't worrying about me. \n\nIf I saw them in public, I would ignore them. \n\nI would not invite them to dinner to enact some 15 year old fantasy of telling them how shitty they were and making them apologise. \n\nAnd *then*, upon realising they aren't the same people they once were and have them apologise sincerely, to then get mad about that because it didn't go the way I thought and now all that anger has nowhere to go. \n\nThat's not normal, it isn't nice and it was not the right thing to do.

If you think that's normal...well, we know what you were in school lol.", "TL;DR.\n\n\"Do you think the OP should have reached out to apologize for their past history of being emotionally/verbally abusive to their victim?\"\n\nYes, yes I do. And literally anyone that has a shred of human decency and ethics thinks the same ffs.", "Not always. In this case no.", "Living in the past is her burden. Not OPs problem.\n\n\nIf we all obsessed over every bad childhood experience then we'd never get anything done.", "Wow. That sounds like a lot more bullying than just a bit", "But the situation isn't as black and white as that, it never is. \n\nI'm fairly certain you did read what I said and the TL;DR was just a juvenile attempt to appear witty.\n\n But we do actually agree on the key points here, I'm just taking a more realistic and rounded stance. \n\nYou're being a dick. Please stop. Hope that's short enough for you.", "I have a problem with this approach. At the point we are talking about, a decade or more, when you as the repentant bully don't know this person. You reach out to them, and apologise out of the blue. But maybe they moved on. Or maybe they have not, and don't wish to be reminded of it. Maybe it was so traumatic that reminding them at all just reawakens the pain. But you don't know either way. At this point, apologising is more about forgiving yourself, or trying to seek forgiveness. And I don't think it's often welcome, so in that case if such a long time has passed without contact then reaching out could be, and often is, a mistake that achieves nothing, or worse by bringing all the trauma up again.\n\nI'm not saying that Anne's anger isn't justified: she was bullied, OP played a part, she has every right to be angry. But she seems to have used that anger to deceive, and then to insult, someone who had already understood their error. What was achieved by lashing out, by lying, by insulting OP's family into the bargain? There's no call for it. If she wanted an apology, better to have led with that rather than by pretending to have moved on for a whole conversation.", "\"Abusers don't bear any responsibility for the damage they inflict on their victims. That's the victims problem.\"\n\nUnreal.", "It was not a fun time. \n\nBut my point is that you can be bullied a *lot* and still come out the other end as a person who deals with their emotions in a reasonably healthy way...and does not enact some weird revenge fantasy onto their bullies 15 years after the fact. \n\nIt would be great if OP had reached out and apologised, but I understand why that didn't happen. And I think in this situation, OP actually acted better than the girl she had once bullied.", "Actually, it was simply a way to tell you I wasn't going to read paragraphs of you defending the idea that after enough times passes, people simply aren't responsible for being abusive to someone else.\n\nAlso yeah, if someone was abused they absolutely have the right to at least make a snide comment to their abusers face.", "Yeah, and OP gave a sincere apology along with an explanation.

She is though.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't want an apology, she wants humiliation for OP\n\nShe apologize, she can move on", "Agree. I have heard from many victims of bullying that they would hate to have someone reach out over social media and apologize to them. They would think they were only doing it to ease their own mind, so selfish reasons. What should OP had done? It's not like she could build a time machine and go back in time and un-do the bullying.", "Theres a big difference between wanting an apology and wanting revenge using the shame associated the apology.\n\n>Expecting you to get in touch with her out of nowhere to apologise is not a realistic expectation. - Not if you're the main character", ">I was bullied relentlessly in high school, but if any of my bullies reached out to me on social media out of the blue, I'd be like 'fuck that'.\n\nI had a girl who bullied me friend me on facebook and when I cancelled her request she messaged me to ask why.  I told her that we were never friends, so why would I accept a friend request.  She was convinced that we were friends and that she had always been so nice to me, even though she had to be sent home in hysterics (like, proper screaming-so-hard-the-whole-school-knew-about-it-people-thought-someone-had-died hysterics) the day I stood up to her and she nearly got expelled over it once the whole story came out.  So I accepted her request, waited two days for her to forget and then dropped her.  It seemed like less effort than dealing with her delusional ass.", "Definitely seems like she just wanted to make OP feel uncomfortable and ashamed. It's fine if she doesn't want to forgive her for going along with things, but meeting with her and then bringing up that topic to make OP apologise and to then criticise the apology being late or not good enough implies she really hasn't healed much at all.", "I agree, but if any of my bullies does reach out to *me* I hope I find out they are divorced losers and *not* happily married doctors lol! \n\nFrom what I do know, a few of them seemed to have peaked back in HS playing football and bullying their classmates.  So sad.", "I was bullied in high school and have had nothing to to with anyone I went to school with. If they were to reach out to me on social media I would block them without reading. Don't understand why she would expect you to reach out to her.", "Oh yes.  Honestly, I would be annoyed if any of my former bullies stalked me on social media and reached out.  Would definitely ignore them while rolling my eyes hard.", "No she doesn't need to get over it if it caused trauma. Bullies need to be called out.", ">\tI sort of get it, they are the ones that could help if they were the magical movie protagonists that can put the bully in their place.\n\nMore like they\u2019re safer/more satisfying targets for anger. The worst bullies are likely to not care one bit what they did in high school or might even pick up where they left off. OP as a silent bystander is a much safer target for Anne\u2019s anger.", "Everyone is downvoting your comments, but I agree with you. \n\nOP minimizes her actions quite a bit here, and it seems like she\u2019s trying to garner sympathy\u2014 \u201cyeah, I was there, but I wasn\u2019t *that* mean to her.\u201d (I\u2019d be willing to bet that\u2019s probably what her apology actually sounded like to Anne). \n\nThe victim wouldn\u2019t have sought her out if she wasn\u2019t a direct participant. I get being closeted and scared, but you\u2019d think that\u2019d give her a bit more empathy.", "My best friend went through something like this just before Christmas.\n\nBackstory - she got involved with a married man who lied about getting divorced.   Wife found out, much drama happened. 25 years ago.\n\nFriend is at work, serving at some banquet, and the ex wife walks up and starts chatting with her.  Friend freaks, hides in bathroom a couple minutes, comes out, and admits to her blame and apologizes.\n\nFrom the sounds of it, the ex wife had planned on drawing out a stressful encounter as payback (they've crossed paths before), but teh sincere apology left her spinning.", "She sounds like a very manipulative person", ">It's like she wanted a big emotional gotcha moment and instead she got a sincere apology so she had to switch it up to feed her anger.\n\nShe attempted to deceive and straight up bully OP into a grand apology for her ego and not out of sincerity or getting past trauma. OP was basically a teenager that witnessed bullying but didn't actually bully OP apparently. Anne expecting her to reach out earlier out of nowhere and being so mad at OP for actually admitting her faults as a fucking teenager, seems worse and more entitled bullying behaviour than OP seems to have done.", "This is another really good point. Because you're right, I actively would not want my bullies to contact me. \n\nIt would bring back all that trauma and all those memories, and more often than not it is self-serving.", "Plus depending on what happened, it could retriggger trauma. \n\nI am of the opinion the interactions should be initiated by the victim based on what is healthy for them. It shouldn't be done to assuage guilt by the perpetrator.", "I do. I was fucking TORMENTED. From 3rd grade through the end of highschool. I was never let to feel like I wasn't ugly and weird.  I STILL feel ugly and weird. I am a fully adult person.", "Where are you getting that from?", "And I'm guessing this story was written by the same person who wrote here a couple of days ago about meeting this acquaintance they hadn't seen since forever, who was friendly at first but then suddenly got mad and unfairly accused them of bullying. \n\n(Except gender flipped.)", "I mean, OP does minimize in her post--- Anne was \"teased\" for being perceived as gay, sure--- so who knows how sincere (regardless of intent) the apology sounded to Anne. \n\nImagine experiencing targeted homophobic harassment and having someone who at the very least enabled that call it teasing. Then OP minimizes her role by saying that, yeah, she was rude and judgmental but she didn't like directly do anything really either way so...\n\n If we're going to make wild conjectures, why not give Anne some credit. Maybe she did go in thinking OP had really worked on herself only to find that OP still wasn't willing to take full responsibility for her behavior? Maybe instead of OP apologizing for her behavior, maybe Anne also got a treatise on how it was actually just \"teasing,\" OP didn't *actually* do anything to her, and it was because of internalized homophobia so maybe the real victim is OP?\n\nI mean, there's plenty of reasons OP would have had not to come out as a teen. Seeing and participating in what was done to Anne? Probably part of it. \n\nAt best, with the info given here, I think this is a soft ESH. People are very quick to jump to OP's side on this, and internalized homophobia sucks yeah, but it doesn't excuse that OP participated in homophobic harassment. However much Anne insisted on meeting, OP agreed to and she did her best to get away without acknowledging that she did things she should apologize for.", "If your actions ended up hurting someone in the past and you apologize to someone now they\u2019re totally within their rights to tell you to fuck off. A person who\u2019s truly sorry offers an apology with no expectation of it being accepted and no excuses for what they did. If they have doubts after having it rejected then they probably were offering it to excuse themselves. Reading the post OP is throwing out all her reasons for doing what she did and minimizing her role in it. That\u2019s not an apology that\u2019s asking for forgiveness.  She didn\u2019t get it and now feels bad because she knows she was never really sorry to begin with she only wanted to be let off the hook.", "I think you\u2019ve got a good understanding of how homophobic bullying affects lesbians. Now put yourself in the shoes of OP - a closeted lesbian who saw the people around her tear down a gender nonconforming straight girl by using homophobic insults. Ideally, yes, OP would have said something in this other girl\u2019s defense, but I think she deserves some grace for being a scared kid. I think you and OP have a lot in common with being girls attracted to girls affected by homophobic bullying, even if your experience was more direct than hers.", "How dare you not apologise to me on Facebook so I can screenshot and share with everyone else and embarrass or harass you", "Except it's even worse, it's:\n\nWoman 1 (OP): Here\u2019s a picture of my wife and kids.\r  \n\r  \nWoman 2: Ironic, since you used to say nothing when OHTER PEOPLE called me gay in high school.\r  \n\r  \nWoman 1: Yeah, and I\u2019m really sorry about that.

But then Anne slid right into A H territory with this:  \n\n>She called me an entitled AH who could get whatever she wanted from life. Anne said I should have apologised long ago. *She then left and told me she genuinely hoped I was a better human because my wife and daughter deserved the person I was back then.*\n\nHer hope may have been genuine but it was definitely uncaring, and worse because she's an adult.", "But I don't want to deal with them in any way. Apology or no. I don't want them to come to me about how bad they were, or not ....", "Plenty of gay people in heterosexual marriages.", "You can give someone grace and still hold them accountable for the harm they caused. These are not mutually exclusive concepts.\n\nWas OP in a horrible situation as a teen? Undoubtedly. Did she agree to meet with Anne? Yes. Did she try to avoid acknowledging the harm she took a part in causing however indirectly? Well, Anne did have to bring up the bullying herself. Did Anne cross the line in this interaction? Yep.\n\nIs OP trying to downplay her role and impact in what happened now as an adult woman with a child? Unfortunately, that is how it is coming across to a few people. Apparently, that's what it looked like to Anne. I hope that what OP gets from this isn't that Anne is a weirdo for having wounds that have yet to heal. Or that she's an irredeemable monster for not having the tools to deal with homophobia in a completely flawless way as a teen. But if OP's apology was anything along the lines of this post then she probably fumbled it and came across as a little dismissive.\n\nSometimes all you can do is acknowledge and apologize for hurting someone. To do that sincerely you have to actually take responsibility for what happened though. You don't minimize, you don't excuse, you don't quantify.", "My wife 'passes' as straight. She was also 'straight' until university. Her experience tracks a lot more like OP's. She can have grace for being a scared kid, I get that. but the other side of grace is -extending- it to others. In this case, the high school acquaintance she watched get bullied (and or participated in bullying). I'm not saying OP is the worst person ever, but it sounds like she delivered an apology with very little introspection, and acceptance of her part in the bullying. \"I didn't know better\" is a cop out in an apology. For sure she knew that girl being teased for being gay was wrong. We all know better when we're joining in or not walking away.", "Yep, I'm not arguing that she was or wasn't wrong.
