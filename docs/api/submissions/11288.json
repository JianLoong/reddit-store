Please help me see if I was indeed being an arse. Thank you.\n\nI (30F) saw an old high school friend (Anne - 30F) the other day at work (I'm a doctor and her friend has been in my care for quite some time now. After Anne knew who I was through her friend, she said she wanted to come and say hi). \n\nWith Anne's persistence, I agreed to grab a cup of coffee with her over my break. We talked about the old days and all. She said she had a husband and two kids. After Anne asked, I told her I now had a wife and a 4 year old daughter. \n\nAt first, she was very excited, asked me if she could see some pictures of us so I showed her a few. After that, she laughed and told me how ironic this whole thing was given the fact that I used to bully her back in the day. \n\nBack in high school, Anne was more or less of a tomboy. I was a cheerleader. I didn't know any better and I used to be quite cold towards her. I unfortunately didn't say anything when my friends would talk about her sexuality. \n\nThey used to tease her for being 'gay' even though she wasn't. I went along with it and didn't say anuthing. I also was rude and judgemental. I'm not at all proud of the way I was. Quite the opposite actually. However, I never made any comments myself. I was a silent bystander which is also horrible but I just wanted to clarify.\n\nI said I was deeply sorry for not being a good friend back then, and I apologised. I also told her I was a confused closeted girl who had no idea what she wanted. (I didn't know what I wanted pretty much until I met my wife) Later, I said I wish I could take it back and make it up to her.\n\nShe told me she got an apology only after she found me and asked me why I hadn't tried to apologise through social media. I don't use social media much . I simply said I was sorry and didn't know any better. And I said I honestly didn't think she'd want to hear about any of this.\n\nShe called me an entitled AH who could get whatever she wanted from life. Anne said I should have apologised long ago. She then left and told me she genuinely hoped I was a better human because my wife and daughter deserved the person I was back then.\n\nWas I indeed an AH?", "created_utc": 1677755601, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g07ev/aita_for_not_apologising_to_a_girl_i_used_to_bully/", "score": 353, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Clearly, she wanted an apology. But that's a fucked up way to go about getting one. \n\nBut what's especially frustrating here is that you *did* apologise to her...you explained that you were a stupid kid and you said sorry. \n\nI don't really understand why she expected more of you than that. \n\nExpecting you to get in touch with her out of nowhere to apologise is not a realistic expectation.  \n\nI was bullied relentlessly in high school, but if any of my bullies reached out to me on social media out of the blue, I'd be like 'fuck that'. \n\nHer behaviour was deceitful and weird, and then to insult you even when she was the one who asked you to hang out and you did actually apologise when she asked you to.\n\nIf she disliked you that much, then she could have no other reason to ask you to hang out with her other than to be a dick to you and make you feel shitty. \n\nNah, she's the asshole here, not you.", "I'm gonna go with NTA. You apologized when you two met again, that's good.\n\nHer being upset that you didn't reach out to her right away to apologize is a bit weird.\n\nHell, a lot of people *do not like it* when a bully tries to insert themselves into their lives, years later, just to absolve themselves, just 'cause they want an \"I forgive you\", because it just opens up old wounds.", "In case I missed something, this woman sought you out to catch up and have a cup of coffee, and then told you that you bullied her in high school. When you apologized, she told you it wasn\u2019t good enough? What else does she want from you? NTA.", "NTA.\n\nMost of us walk away from school and don't keep in touch. It seems odd of her to expect you to seek her out specifically to apologise. The normal thing to do there really is to just sort of, move on? Sure, reaching out to someone you used to bully would be a very good thing to do, but she may well have also never wanted to hear from you again and so reaching out wouldn't have had a good impression.\n\nI was bullied at school a bit and honestly if any of my former bullies dropped me a message on Instagram to apologise, I'd probably just ignore it. I think I'd genuinely prefer to never hear from any of them again. Like what are they expecting? It's not like we're gonna become friends now. It makes zero difference in my life whether they message me or not. I genuinely don't care. It was so many years ago now, I'm over it and I've moved on with my life.\n\nSo yea, reaching out earlier on might have been a good thing to do, but I don't think it makes you an asshole for not reaching out sooner. It just makes you...normal.", "NTA. Anne needs help to get over her past, not to berate you. You apologized, end of story.", "NTA\n\nThis wasn't a friendly cup of coffee, this was an AMBUSH.", "NTA\n\nWhile it might still be hurtful, she got out of high school 12 years ago. If she really had a problem and wanted to discuss it with you she shouldn't have invited you out for a \"friendly lunch\" and then tried to back you into a corner to feel guilty.", "You're NTA. You did apologize. The fact that you did not seek her out on social media to do it doesn't make you an A-H. Her part in this conversation screams that she deliberately set this up just so she could lash out at you for things that happened over a decade ago. I wonder if she seeks out all her other high school classmates for the same purpose.", "NTA- you apologised sincerely and clearly feel terrible about things you let happen around you. \nWhat more does she want?\n\nHaver any of the others reached out to her in the past to apologise?", "Unpopular opinion but to me NAH.\n\nYou apologized. And seems like a more sincere apology than something I could've given under the circumstances. It is also true that trying to track her and inserting yourself in her life would probably have done more harm than good. This is not \"my name is earl\". \n\nBut also it's within her right whether or not to choose to accept your apology. It's her prerogative whether she forgives you. \n\nSometimes there's wrongs we cannot undo, there's things we cannot unbreak.", "NTA. Sounds like you did apologize to me. And she wasnt expecting it and still wanted the scene she had in her head you deserved. Not your problem. \nAs weird as it sounds I'm actually cool with a bully from my past who was like you..only sometimes she did say things too. She just never put hands on me like her friends. She ended up being my bestfriends bestfriend and neighbor when we were adults. She was so excited to see me and so shocked when I asked why she wanted to be nice to me now. She apologized,  said she was stupid and insecure..she just wanted her friends/bullies to like her too. I asked her if she wanted to smoke a blunt and we talked about our kids for awhile. Now I'd consider her a friend. She owned what she did and apologized. And is a diffrent person who had actually had my back quite a few times when needed. \nIt dosent always turn out this way, theres others I wouldn't forgive if they apologized but...sometimes kids are stupid and thoughtless and cruel. I know i myself was at times in diffrent ways.  I think those who genuinely mean it when they are contrite deserve a second chance to be a decent human. Without that..there probably wouldn't be alot of decent humans out there.", "NTA. I don't know how you could have handled it better. \n\nSometimes people take the most offence not on the bullies, but on the silent participants. I sort of get it, they are the ones that could help if they were the magical movie protagonists that can put the bully in their place. \n\nThat's not certain though, people stay silent because they don't want to be the one on the receiving end and holding this against the silent participant isn't helping anyone. This is kids were are talking about afterall. Adults we can hold accountable up to a point.\n\nHer comment sounds like she could really use some therapy. Or this is the first time she has opened up about it and she might even regret saying that now that she got it off her chest.", "I'm gunna say NTA. You were an asshole for being that kind of person back then, but one doesn't change overnight and after high school people drift apart from each other and from who they were. Probably you never gave it another thought, and while that's too bad, it's not asshole level.   At least when the memory of it all popped back into your life, you had the maturity to understand how bad you had been and apologize.", "NTA\n\nYou apologised. She then asked why you didn't apologise to her online and then gave out to you because she perceived you to have had it easy. She needs therapy.\n\nPerhaps it's because I was bullied by so many people that they became a hostile amorphous blob or because I'm autistic but when bullies have apologised to me I've not really cared about the apology and cared more about changes they've made to their behaviour. It's scary to stand out as a teen and no one knows exactly why one behaves poorly but it's usually through fear of becoming the target.", "NTA, she basically ambushed you. Even if you did use social media a lot, why would you go out of your way to message a girl you went to school with over a decade ago who probably didn't cross your mind until very recently? This was a self-serving stunt and she is TA.", "NTA\n\nWe can't walk around apologizing to anyone we realize hurted when we were kids. Kids sometimes do super fucked up things. It's not good, and it's absolutely something we have to apologize for. WHEN it happens. Not years later as adults. We are not nearly the same people at the age of 30 as we were at the age of 16.\n\nYou did your part apologizing in person when you two met, doing it through social media several years after it happened would've been unnecessary.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA. \n\nLook, no one ever has to accept an apology. But when the behavior is in the past and not ongoing, you can either accept the apology or not. You don\u2019t get to keep berating someone for an apology already given or act like it doesn\u2019t count. And here, she basically browbeat you into meeting up with her and demanded an apology with every intention of dismissing that apology when given. That\u2019s frankly bizarre behavior.", "I don't know how it's going to be perceived but I'd personally say NAH.\n\nIn your situation you couldn't apology through social media, not everyone wants to remember those kind of experiences, therefore you took a respectful approach not contacting Anne.\n\nAt the same time, I can see how Anne reacted, I can't blame her and at least she got an apology, I hope the best for you both.", "NTA - she\u2019s right you should have apologised a long time ago (if you were aware of your actions and their impact on their), but a late sincere apology is better than none. It sounds like she\u2019s taking it out on you for all the others who never apologised.", "NTA\n\nIf your story is true and you never actually never did the bullying, but just were a bystander, then it is fine. Being cold and not a good friend is not being an asshole in my opinion. You even apologized for not acting which wasn't even your duty. \n\nShe really needs therapy if this bothers her to this day, with or without apologies from her bullies.", "NTA. I don't understand people who think they're entitled to an apology from an adult for actions from childhood. Everyone has a rough time in school. Most people spend some amount of time on both sides of bullying.", "YTA. You were a bully. And you have a problem with accepting it. Stop all 'but's' and give her an unconditional apology. What you did is not apologize. You made excuses and invalidated her pain. You are AH. A huge one.", "This is unpopular  but I'm going to go with ESH. She ambushed you with this which isn't  cool and it was weird she expected you to contact  her out of the blue. I'm glad you apologized but let's be honest sorry doesn't  really do much. Idk why reddit  thinks a simple apology makes everything  okay because it doesn't.", "ESH\nProbably unpopular opinion. You were a bully OP and for that you will always suck to her. You are a person that caused her trauma that you have no idea how much it has affected her throughout her life. That earlier apology was probably something that could have helped her a lot. And now you come complaining that your past actions have consequences in her lashing out at you. Can you really blame her?", "NTA, sje invited you for a drink of coffee or whatever under false pretences and then ambushed you about the passed, which you apologised over.", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m calling bullshit on her. She was fishing for an apology so she could make you feel bad when you did.", "NTA - sounds like she just wanted you to publicly humiliate yourself. Social media - seriously! Talk about entitled! Love your self-reflection and that you took responsibility for your actions (or non-actions). Thank you for sharing this.", "NTA Clearly, she was after more than an apology, since... she got that. Probably money.", "How could you be \"rude and judgemental\" if you were simply a \"silent bystander?\"\n\nLike you realize that people who weren't bullies don't get randomly accused of being a bully and years later have people from their childhood bring it up...right?\n\nThat doesn't happen to people that weren't bullies.\n\nYTA. Both for expecting that your apology had to be accepted...and then for coming to Reddit and lying to all of us by denying that you actually were a bully.", "Yta you were a bully.", "NTA. Honestly, sounds like she came over just to berate you and ruin your day. The comment she made is something you would think of after festering for a while not in the moment. Dont feel bad because nothing you would have done in the past nor present would have been good enough for her. If anything you should feel bad for her since she seemly cant let go of the past.", "NTA. You apologised not only for being a bystander, but also for what the other girls did in a way. But even after you apologised, Anne still didn't accept your apology. Not only that but why, after all these years, would you search for someone's social media? It's a bit creepy tbh.\n\nOP's NTA.

That's not much of an apology.", "Exactly this. You apologized when pressed in person, and that's understandable.

It just wasn't as important to you as fitting in with your friends. Like, how hard is it to say \"yanno, I was wrong then and it wasn't okay. I made bad choices and I'm sorry for the pain it caused you\"?", "You really don\u2019t think Anne was a complete asshole in this situation? She ambushed OP for an apology. After getting the apology Anne says it should have happened a long time ago and proceeds to insult the wife and daughter. Just because someone was bullied as a child doesn\u2019t give them the moral high ground. In fact saying an apology should have happened a long time when you get it automatically makes you an asshole", "Lots of people never called me a dyke at school, but they stood around and laughed when other people did and didn't try to stop it, and that's tacit participation in the bullying. I've been in therapy for years over a self esteem problem and social anxiety I developed from the same kind of bullying in school. Sure, I don't chase my bullies down for apologies (because fuck them), but that shit bothers people their whole lives.", "You realize that the reason \"everyone has a rough time in school\" is literally because of this exact mindset of *not* expecting bullies to apologize for their behavior later on...right?", "And she even got the apology, heartfelt it seems, and was still an AH.", "She's not in OPs life anymore. OP doesn't need to beg for forgiveness on their hands and knees, because of how they acted as a kid. This woman is living in the past.", "Um, OP did apologize. You think it wasn't good enough because she provided the context behind it? Context is good.", "So what else was OP supposed to do?", "I'm kinda with you here, yeah, she did kind of ambush her, which is kinda not fair. On the other hand, homophobic bullying during school is not necessarily a small thing in another person's life and it might warrant a lot more than a pressed \"I'm sorry you felt that way\". Personally, I grew from a tomboy into an anxious butch lesbian. Everyone called me \"dyke\" at school constantly and that made accepting my sexuality and presentation very difficult. I internalized their homophobia and directed it at myself. I self harmed over it, and spent years trying to be someone I wasn't. I developed social anxiety in junior high and high school that persists in my mid thirties. I didn't come out until mid university because of it,and it severely impacted my self esteem. I don't know if OP really understands the impacts of her behaviour when she was younger. At the same time, for me, anyone who called me Dyke in high school is a complete write off, even if I proudly wear the label now. I understand looking for closure, but what can you expect from high school bullies, really? Yeah ESH.", "This is very insightful", "It doesn't sound like Anne was bullied \"a bit\", it sounds like it was quite frequent and targeted. Also, everyone handles things like this differently. What doesn't affect you will fuck up others, and I'm sure things that wouldn't bother her would affect you deeply as well. That's just how humans are.", "She didn't bully her, and she's now a grown woman so maybe she should get over it instead of holding resentment forever", "Ok, so let me get this straight. \n\nWhat you think should have happened here is that OP should have reached out, at random, to someone they wronged in high school but haven't seen or heard from since, and said sorry I was kind of mean to you?? \n\nOr, sorry I didn't say anything when other people were kind of mean to you 15 years ago? \n\nThat isn't a realistic expectation. In a perfect world, nobody would be bullied, and if anyone was bullied, the bullies would always come around, realise their wrongdoings, and reach out to those they wronged and apologise. But this is not the world we live in. \n\nI mean, frankly, you've been a bit of a dick to me right now, your tone is aggressive and surly and you've accused me of placing conditions on people and whether or not they deserve an apology (which I haven't done, by the way) and I think I probably deserve an apology from you...but I ain't gonna get one, that much I know. \n\nMy expectations are realistic. I know that no matter what you say online, there will always be strangers on the internet that disagree and get pissy, and then choose to make aggressive comments. Should you be doing that? No, probably not. But this is the world we live in. \n\nAt the very least OP realises that they were a stupid kid who did a mean thing, and they apologised. That's better than the big old nothing most victims of bullying ever get. \n\nWhy tf would this girl want to hang out with someone that bullied them if not to fulfill some fantasy of calling them out and making them feel shitty? Just because she was bullied doesn't give her the right to engage in bullying behaviour now. Fighting fire with fire does not work. Especially when it is 15 years later and your lives and personalities are most likely vastly different. That makes her the AH, not OP.", "Yeah reading it back it does kind of seem like that.

Like...physically beaten up by groups of people to the point where I was hospitalised and those people were expelled from school, that level of bullying. \n\nIt has affected me hugely, it has shaped who I am as a person and yeah, sometimes I wish those people could see what they did and I wish they would apologise. \n\nBut, most days, I don't think about those people. \n\nThey mean nothing to me anymore. Giving them meaning in my life gives them power, because you can bet they ain't worrying about me. \n\nIf I saw them in public, I would ignore them. \n\nI would not invite them to dinner to enact some 15 year old fantasy of telling them how shitty they were and making them apologise. \n\nAnd *then*, upon realising they aren't the same people they once were and have them apologise sincerely, to then get mad about that because it didn't go the way I thought and now all that anger has nowhere to go. \n\nThat's not normal, it isn't nice and it was not the right thing to do.

If you think that's normal...well, we know what you were in school lol.", "TL;DR.\n\n\"Do you think the OP should have reached out to apologize for their past history of being emotionally/verbally abusive to their victim?\"\n\nYes, yes I do. And literally anyone that has a shred of human decency and ethics thinks the same ffs.", "Not always. In this case no.", "Living in the past is her burden. Not OPs problem.\n\n\nIf we all obsessed over every bad childhood experience then we'd never get anything done.", "Wow. That sounds like a lot more bullying than just a bit", "But the situation isn't as black and white as that, it never is. \n\nI'm fairly certain you did read what I said and the TL;DR was just a juvenile attempt to appear witty.\n\n But we do actually agree on the key points here, I'm just taking a more realistic and rounded stance. \n\nYou're being a dick. Please stop. Hope that's short enough for you.", "I have a problem with this approach. At the point we are talking about, a decade or more, when you as the repentant bully don't know this person. You reach out to them, and apologise out of the blue. But maybe they moved on. Or maybe they have not, and don't wish to be reminded of it. Maybe it was so traumatic that reminding them at all just reawakens the pain. But you don't know either way. At this point, apologising is more about forgiving yourself, or trying to seek forgiveness. And I don't think it's often welcome, so in that case if such a long time has passed without contact then reaching out could be, and often is, a mistake that achieves nothing, or worse by bringing all the trauma up again.\n\nI'm not saying that Anne's anger isn't justified: she was bullied, OP played a part, she has every right to be angry. But she seems to have used that anger to deceive, and then to insult, someone who had already understood their error. What was achieved by lashing out, by lying, by insulting OP's family into the bargain? There's no call for it. If she wanted an apology, better to have led with that rather than by pretending to have moved on for a whole conversation.", "\"Abusers don't bear any responsibility for the damage they inflict on their victims. That's the victims problem.\"\n\nUnreal.", "It was not a fun time. \n\nBut my point is that you can be bullied a *lot* and still come out the other end as a person who deals with their emotions in a reasonably healthy way...and does not enact some weird revenge fantasy onto their bullies 15 years after the fact. \n\nIt would be great if OP had reached out and apologised, but I understand why that didn't happen. And I think in this situation, OP actually acted better than the girl she had once bullied.", "Actually, it was simply a way to tell you I wasn't going to read paragraphs of you defending the idea that after enough times passes, people simply aren't responsible for being abusive to someone else.\n\nAlso yeah, if someone was abused they absolutely have the right to at least make a snide comment to their abusers face.", "Yeah, and OP gave a sincere apology along with an explanation.

Because we have no idea what the frequency was. What we know is that it left enough of an impression on the victim for them to bring it up *years later* and get mad at a perceived lack of accountability. That suggests it was more than just a few times.\n\n>That's not the same thing as being an abuser\n\n\"Engaging in abusive behavior doesn't mean you're abusive.\"\n\n>People are responsible for themselves\n\n>You aren't responsible for fixing other people's hang ups decades later.\n\nNobody said abusers have to \"fix\" their victims trauma.", "Ok, but I\u2019m basing my reaction on what OP wrote, which is that she was having a conversation with someone who brought up something that hurt her in the past and OP responded with an apology. It\u2019s unfair to add additional details that OP didn\u2019t include just based on your assumptions.", "Look, whatever life event you've been through that you're projecting on to this, we aren't talking about that.\n\n\nOP did exactly what any well adjusted adult would do in that scenario and the woman she was apologising to was being unreasonable (regardless of whatever may have happened when they were kids). There comes a point in adulthood where most people realise that they aren't the child they used to be. That child died long ago; only their memory survives. It's the same for any friends or bullies or acquaintances you had in your school. Those people don't exist anymore. Holding onto your childhood like that isn't healthy, and if you can't let go, then you need a therapist (not a more dramatic apology).", ">. I also was rude and judgemental.\n\n>However, I never made any comments myself.\n\nSo which one is it?", "NTA Sounds as if she arranged the meeting with an agenda in mind.  \n\nIf she won't accept a heartfelt apology, that's now on her.", "NTA, this was a setup by her because she never let it go. You apologized and it was in HS. Not defending bullying, but you are obviously a different person now and did change your ways. History can\u2019t be changed unfortunately", "Nta, but you were a bully. Not saying anything is allowing the bullying to happen thus you are complicit, especially because these were your friends and not just a random group of girls bullying someone.

I still received demeaning comments on my social media when I had it beyond Reddit and discord, they aren\u2019t going to feel remorse for how they treated me. Should I ever be invited to a school reunion I\u2019m doubtful I\u2019d go. I hated school. But if I did I doubt anyone would want to interact with me at all. That\u2019s just, whatever, yes they (not all, but a lot) can go to hell but I do not think they would apologise.\n\nYou should probably try to give that person some space if possible, and if they try to insist on seeing you more consider putting up some very strong boundaries at least temporarily. It sounds like they\u2019re not in a good place.", "NTA", "NTA \nLmao\u2026..She\u2019s been waiting to say that to you. Practicing in the mirror. \nAn in person apology comes off much more sincere than a random DM.", "Nta, just because you didn't apologize when or how she wanted doesn't mean you didn't apologize", "NTA, you *did* apologize", "Ugh I hate bullies", "Nope NTA. She\u2019s the AH. She lined you up to get all her gripes of her chest. It sounds like you apologised appropriately.", "Only when you were young, certainly not at that lunch.", "NTA.

Sounds like she wanted a fight, not an apology.", "NTA it was a set up, didn't go the way she wanted cause you did apologize,  she got mad.", "NTA absolutely. She's rightly still hurt about being bullied; I get that. But if you had, out of the blue, messaged her on socials that, to me, would've come across as entirely self-serving (alleviating your own guilt) - opening old wounds just to make yourself feel better. And I get the sense she would've said / felt as much!\n\nYou gave a sincere, heartfelt apology after a legitimate personal re-connection. That's really all any of us could hope for.", "Nah - You made her feel like shit then, she made you feel like shit now. Could she have been a bigger person? Sure. But your and your friends actions likely caused her a lifetime of working through trauma, so I don't think its morally outrageous for her to cause you to sit with your feelings of guilt for an afternoon.\n\nMaybe you didn't say anything, but if she's still holding a grudge after all this time it seems likely you were more than just a passive bystander in all this.", "I think Anne realized halfway through this that an apology from her former bully didn't give her any sense of resolution, and lashed out accordingly. For some people it can, and others can be struck by the fact that nothing changed. She sounds jealous of where OP is in life, and while it's absolutely true that what she went through in high school may have impacted her trajectory, that's nothing an apology can change. Dissatisfaction with your life can only be changed by you: either by changing your circumstance or your mindset.", "Exactly, if any of my childhood bullies reached out to me now I would wonder if this was some sobriety check list they had to go through to make amends.\n\nWhat I want them to do is be decent people who don't let their kids become bullies too.", "Right!  Many times I see on those sub people telling former bullies \"don't reach out on social media and inflict your presence upon your old victims just so you can apologize.\"  Anna's behavior seems very vindictive.  I don't blame  her for feeling angry or even vindictive but acting on it years later and being mad op didn't reach out is weird", "I agree, she was definitely TA here.  Manipulative and rude.  She deliberately set you up.  You are NTA, OP.", "If one of my high school bullies reached out to me out of nowhere i\u2019d have a panic attack. Shit i had some adult bullies at the tender age of 26 that would make me freeze if i saw their name in a message. \n\nit\u2019s definitely not normal to sit around and wait for an apology from childhood from someone who is a literal stranger to you as an adult. NTA.", "Yeah it feels like she set it up so OP would apologize just so she could be all \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d about it", "You don't think it was kind of an AH move to lure your former grade school bully to a meetup with the hopes of getting an apology that you (apparently) don't intend to accept and using that meetup to bully them in the here & now? \n\nShe already knew she wasn't going to accept the apology because OP didn't reach out on her own years ago.

She specifically went after OP rather than the others because OP is gay and then reminded her that the bullying centered on her sexuality.\n\nIt\u2019s really just a hunch and I could easily be wrong, but she would need to be particularly motivated to want an entire coffee date for an apology for high school bullying that OP didn\u2019t even orchestrate or enact. People are lazy and flakey as hell with people we *love* so I\u2019m looking for a present-day motivator/goal that is strong enough to solicit what is essentially a date with guaranteed awkward confrontation. Usually I\u2019d assume they want to show off how successful they\u2019ve become\u2026 but this one is too tied up in both woman\u2019s sexuality for me to ignore. \n\nThe fact that she\u2019s married with a baby even leans me further in that direction because married people cheat all the time and both being married could have been her way of disarming op.

Even if she didn\u2019t hurl that insult I still think Anne is an ass for how she handled things", "You're not wrong, but my point was simply that things affect different people differently. I'm happy that you were able to move past your bullying in a constructive and healthy way, and her trauma doesn't excuse her behavior, but it does inform the situation and make the behavior much more understandable. Not everyone is able to move past things like you did.", "Let the victim lead. She started by focusing on the good times, on their lives now, etc. I would have taken that as a cue that she had moved on, and not brought something up that would sour the tone.\n\nEdit: \n\n>\\[Anne\\] said she wanted to come and say hi.  \nWith Anne's persistence, I agreed to grab a cup of coffee with her ... We talked about the old days and all. She said she had a husband and two kids.

After that, she laughed ...\n\nWhere is the opportunity here to interrupt all this positivity and enthusiasm by bringing up something that you could reasonably think may be traumatic for her? I wouldn't touch it with a bargepole. So the only other choice is to approach her randomly in the street, or perhaps to try and arrange a meeting *yourself*, or to track them down on social media or whatever, in order to give that apology. But this is already borderline harassment if you don't know whether the apology is welcome or not; it is (often) self-serving, as often the motivation of such \"apology-stalkers\" is not to apologise to *them,* so much as to get *them* to forgive *you*. And, finally, it's already fifteen years too late. What's a couple more minutes, just to make sure that they want to talk about it?\n\nI can tell you right now, if anybody who'd bullied me at high school or primary school, or even university, reached out, I wouldn't welcome it at all. I've moved on. So should they have. And no doubt there are those I've wronged in the past too, and it's the same way. We've both moved on, and until I know otherwise why would I try to track them down just to let them know I've moved on?", "Well then, more fool you because that isn't actually what I said at all, it isn't what I have said at any point. \n\nYou probably should have read what I've said properly before being a dick to me. I can't believe you can't see the irony in being so staunchly against bullying and then talking the way you are to me. Absolute madness. \n\nYou're being obtuse, and unpleasant. Just stop.", "Oh, I don't think Anne is innocent here. She def needs therapy AND OP used to be an asshole. An ESH situation.", "But this isn\u2019t really about if OP was an asshole as a teen. It\u2019s about if she\u2019s an asshole now for not apologizing earlier. A NTA situation", "It is interesting to me that Anne basically had to call OP out for her to apologize. Like she didn\u2019t remember being awful to this girl. That\u2019s why I still say that ESH.
