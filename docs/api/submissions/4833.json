One excuse after another, to get you to open your door. Nope. Not happening.", "NTA. Holy shit. He definitely wasn\u2019t out for a run and a photo of a bandage is super easy to fake. He was a practical stranger trying to get you alone in the middle of the night in your home. He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and came up with a bunch of excuses to weasel his way in after you repeatedly said no. He\u2019s not just an AH but he\u2019s also a creep. Your bf is also and AH for taking his side and not seeing this for what it is. Ask him for a picture *without* the bandage. You won\u2019t get one. Keep in mind continuing to see you BF may mean having to see this creep continuously in the future.", "NTA, that whole situation is sketchy. You were around him for a year and just now meeting his friends? To me that\u2019s a little odd but to each their own.

It's really suspicious that he showed up out of the blue and so late like that, and you were absolutely right not to let him into the house! For all you know, it could have been a ruse and it's weird that you only met a couple of times and he's referring to you as his \"friend.\" Just because your boyfriend trusts him, doesn't mean you should or have to when you barely even know him.

This whole situation feels very odd! If his knee was in such bad shape it could possibly be broken, how did he get to your house and why wasn't that the first thing he said? Why is he laughing and joking instead of asking immediately for help or for you to call an ambulance? Did you offer and he brushed it off, and why didn't he ask you to call one if his phone is dead?

It's extremely unlikely that he just happened to end up outside your apartment late on a Friday night with an injured knee and a dead phone. At best, he's a creep who was hoping he could put the moves on you once he was alone with you. At worst, he's a dangerous predator. Anybody can put a bandage on their leg after the fact. Your boyfriend is also TA for not supporting you in this, and him enabling Matt's creepy behaviour is an enormous red flag for him as well. It might be time to reconsider this relationship. You did the right thing.", "You are definitely NTA.

Please see that as a red flag", "NTA!  No, you didn\u2019t overreact.  That was creepy af.  Matt is a dangerous AH. The fact that John didn\u2019t have your back?  AH. \nBuh bye, Jon", "Ooof I would have been scared too! The guy sounds overbearing at best and sinister at worst.   If your boyfriend thinks you\u2019re supposed to let creepy guys in your house late at night, and doesn\u2019t even want to hear your side of it, then he doesn\u2019t sound like he cares about you.

Do you really want to be with someone like that? You can do much better.", "10000% NTA. Good for you for trusting your gut.\n\nAlso, consider dumping Jon while you're at it. If he doesn't understand why you wouldn't let a very insistent/potentially aggressive dude that you barely know into your apartment, late at night, after you expressed your discomfort.. then you really need to evaluate if you want that type of partner longterm - especially if he's giving you the silent treatment because he thinks you overreacted.", "NTA!! Your boyf is TA for not understanding how creepy Matt is!", "NTA", "NTA.  I still would not believe his story if I were you.  It's possible he put a bandage on without actually being hurt.  How else would he make you into a bad guy.", "NTA, creepy situation and I would have slammed the door way faster. I probably wouldn\u2019t even open it tbh", "NTA.  Matt really set off some creep, stalker vibes.  Did he say that he normally jogs at midnight?  \n\nThe most you could have done was call 911 and get that ambulance for him.\n\nGood for you for standing your ground and not letting him in.  Your BF needs to understand that as a woman and for your own safety, you are not going to invite someone into your home in the middle of the night that you barely know.", "NTA and that sounds creepy as hell and something as to how not to be murdered", "NTA, you really don\u2019t know him, everything he was saying was sketchy.  I wouldn\u2019t have opened the door.", "NTA. You have to trust your gut. This whole thing is super creepy.", "Absolutely NTA. Keep trusting your instincts, OP. You did the right thing. PS, ditch your boyfriend.", "NTA  So many red flags!! They're the assholes for expecting you to let into your house a virtual stranger at midnight. Lose Matt and Jon for that matter.", "NTA...that is soooo super weird.  I would have been very creeped out too.  If your BF can't empathize with your feelings here, that's concerning.  I wouldn't let an aquintance in my house super late at night.", "Holy creeper much. He was literally looking for you. Murder shows tell me he was going to attack you on that job or attempt to if he was let into your place. Good bye to both guys. Yikes\n\nNTA", "Just reading this gave me chills.\nYou were really smart lying to him in the first place and then not opening the door in the second.\nI bet whatever you want that he doesn't have anything under these bandages and honestly: better loosing a boyfriend then having such a psycho in your life!\nDoes he even live in your area tgat he joggs there??\nPsycho!\n\nNTA. Not for a second. If you let him in and he assaulted you, who would your boyfriend believe in?", "NTA.  Matt is a creepy lying asshole.  If it was about his 'injury' he would have led with that.   It was a pretext to get into your home.   That's how dateline episodes start.  Hard pass.

Frankly your boyfriend is a idiot anyone who clearly loves someone would've said wait hold up you knocked at my girlfriends apartment at midnight over a knee injury. And why the hell did you go running at midnight after she jokingly told you midnight are you trying to get at her cause that's plain creepy. If I ever hear that again we've got a huge problem \n\nHad a similar experience when dating my now husband I was visiting on a trip to see him staying at his place with his young son during the day while he worked. Some random dude starts hammering at the front door yelling for my now partner. At the time he was just a bf so I'm at the door this guy's all hey I need to come in and wait for *name*. I'm confused as hell he's jumping around I need to come in it's an emergency, I need to see *name* it's urgent I'm hurt, walked x miles as he's the closest person I know in the area. Can I just come in. I politely said I'm sorry I don't know who you are, I've never met you *name has never said who you are in relation to him* I have a kid with me you are not coming in. He starts whining that it's hot, his feet hurt and that he's desperate and has nowhere else to go , and that \"everyone\" knows who he is. I am not everyone I don't know you and  said if is that important call him but I doubt he will answer unless  your truly a friend or wait outside under a tree till he comes home and he'll take it from there. He of course couldn't the guy was strung off his face, I had to call my partners mom  because I was so nervous and gave a description of him she immediately drove to mine and basically told him to *go somewhere else as he was also known to her* the guy was a junkie and addict and an ex family member. The emergency he wanted was to ask my partner to go get his car out of impound so he could go get more drugs or booze. I apologized so much. If said the guy was sketchy as hell, obviously on something and he's fighting tooth and nail to get into your house and it scared the chyt out of me. I have your kid I'm alone and there's a strange man expecting me to just let him in \n\nYou know what my partner said I'm sorry he creeped you out and I'm so  glad you said no, I know him but you didn't if I was here he would've been let in only because of xyz.  He could've been anyone but you did the right thing called mom, let me know and triple locked everything. I'm glad you decided to keep him waiting outside.", "NTA and that friend is a creep.

He then changed tactics from trying to invite himself in to claiming he was injured and NEEDED in immediately.

I commend you for not letting his best friend in.  I absolutely believe his was lying about his knee and a bandage means nothing. \n\nYou did not overreact.  You trusted your instinct - don't doubt yourself.\n\nThe main issue moving forward is your boyfriend.  I'm not sure what will happen with him.  His response of \"don't contact him until he's ready to talk\" is not a good sign.  He's choosing his best friend over you.  Now, don't get me wrong....you've been dating less than a year.  I'm not a fan of dumping your friends after 3 months or something like that when you start dating someone.  Most likely, your relationship isn't likely at the point that friends/family are \"second tier\" in priority if that makes sense.  And that's okay.\n\nBut the fact he isn't willing to talk to you, to hear your side of the story....that's a big problem.  It's basically a snapshot of what a future relationship would be like.  If a difficult situation arises, he's not going to talk.  He's going to pick a side.  Great if it's you - in this case it's not you.\n\nRespect his request....and take this time apart to evaluate your relationship.  Try to take a step back and look objectively....this is not easy for anyone.  Is this someone that you could possibly see having children with? (if you desire children).  Is this someone you know you can count on for support when bad things happen (losing a job, developing long term health problems, etc). \n\nBest wishes for you.", "Nta ! You did not overreact!

As I was reading the story I had a chill going up my spine.  I think you really dodged a bullet by not letting this man into your house.  If he were really injured he would have said that first thing and asked for help.  And that his phone was dead is just too much of a coincidence.  Also creepy that he remembered your saying that you jog at night and suddenly appearing.  What does he want with you, and why was he so eager to get inside your house? At best he\u2019s intrusive, pushy, and inappropriate. At worst\u2026 well this isn\u2019t far from the way rapists and serial killers behave.  Be very careful.  Trust your instincts!

Jogging at midnight IS weird, and for Matt to *just so happe * to be out at that time? Give me a brake. I would have been sleeved out my damn mind. \n\nHonestly, Matt seems like he won't take no for an answer, and being alone with him in your house could have gotten real rapey real quick.

Protect yourself from them both and be wary going forward.", "NTA. Believe us, believe us! You made a good decision and stuck to it. The fact he continued to invent reasons to be let in is really off and you were right not to be swayed. The boyfriend might not be a keeper. If he's giving you the big freeze over this, then he both does not understand how women need to take care of themselves (red flag #1) and isn't strong enough to distance himself (let alone rebuke and correct) from his friend in your defence (red flag #2).

One that includes this face. \n\nAlso point out that Matt said it might be broken when he probably wouldn't be able to walk on it if it was.  He tried every excuse he could think of to get in there so it is very likely that he was up to no good.  \n\nIf your BF doesn't trust you or understand why you wouldnt want to have a near stranger in your home in the middle of the night then break up with him now.", "OP=NTA\n\nThat is just creepy.

He\u2019s shown you who he is, I would believe that and count yourself lucky that it\u2019s come out now, rather than later.\n\nYou 100% did the right thing. \nMy bet is he would have tried to hit on you, done something untoward and then told Jon it was all you, and Jon probably would have believed him.", "NTA each time you responded with a no he came up with another excuse to get into your apartment. If he had all of those issues he would\u2019ve stated all of them at the same time but he didn\u2019t.  Having  a Band-Aid on your knee doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re actually hurt.

Any asshole can pick up an ace bandage at a store, that doesn\u2019t mean he was injured and in need of your help.

I would have been scared to let someone I hardly know into my home late at night.  It sounded strange to me.", "NTA as you laid this story out.

NTA, just cautious and alert, as you should have been in that situation.", "He didn't mention his \"injury\" initially. It was just, Hey! I was looking for you, and now I'm at your front door. When you didn't let him in, then he suddenly had an injury...and when you said no, he suddenly had a phone problem. He initially laughed when mentioning his \"injury,\" but then escalated to it might be broken. He was doing his level best to manipulate you into letting him in.\n\nHe was exhibiting classic predator ploys, and for your BF to ignore that is more than a little troubling. \n\nNTA. Not even close.", "So let me get this straight... Matt's first tactic is to act like he was just out jogging at the obviously sarcastic time you said you jog, and wondered what you were up to since he didn't see you out jogging (why was he out looking for you?). \n\nWhen that didn't work, he said he'd hurt his knee and wanted to clean it right then and there instead of just, idk, going home and dealing with it? If it's hurt that badly wouldn't you be finished your jog anyway? \n\nAnd when THAT didn't work, he said it might be broken, even though (I assume, based on your description) he didn't seem in pain at all and was standing normally? If it was hurt enough that he thought it might be broken, why wasn't that the first thing out of his mouth when you answered the door? And why was he trying to use that as an excuse to come in, when he really should go to the hospital (either figuring out a ride himself or by ambulance like you suggested, except oh wait his phone's conveniently dead and instead of just asking to borrow your phone to call a ride he wanted to come in for several minutes to charge it). I'm surprised at that point he didn't insist you needed to drive him to the hospital... except of course he didn't ask you to, because it was never about getting help for an injury. It was about coming into your apartment, where you were alone. \n\nAbsolutely NTA, you were smart and listened to your gut. This reads like one of the milder stories on Let's Not Meet. Ugh.", "Nope. Not an over reaction. I\u2019ve seen this episode and it often doesn\u2019t end well for the woman home alone in the middle of the night. And if your boyfriend is one that discourages you from listening to your gut in situations where your safety is concerned then I\u2019d be reevaluating that immediately. NTA", "NTA. Go with your gut.

It was absolutely the correct action to not let him in your home. \n\nPredators are very manipulative, and his friendship with your bf has probably allowed him to sway bf to his side. Give bf time to calm down and rationally retell the story exactly as you told it here. If bf still sides with the friend, I would make it clear this behavior made you feel unsafe and his friend is no longer welcome near you. BFs reaction will be very telling about your next steps. I hope he sees how predatory this behavior is. \n\nI have literally used examples almost identical to your scenario to train people on predators and stalking. No joke. \n\nFrom a former security professional, please take/consider the following actions.\n\n1) Change all locks. Do not give BF a key until you have resolved this situation to your satisfaction and he can be trusted to support you and your boundary with the friend. (It would be very easy for the friend to steal the key and make a copy without BF noticing)\n\n\n2) Install some kind of camera at home entry points. (Not sure what your finances are like, but there are some reasonable ones online)\n\n\n3) Stop running that route all together and run at a gym, or if you really hate the gym, run in a group at a different location. Change your route and running time frequently if possible.\n\n\n4) While running, use a location sharing app with a friend/trusted agent WHO IS NOT PHYSICALLY WITH YOU. Text them your planned route as well as planned start and end time. Establish criteria for friend calling police and other emergency procedures you feel necessary.\n\n\n5) Make sure a friend or trusted agent (at this point I would not count BF) aware of this incident. Don't keep things like this secret or quiet.\n\n\n6) File a report or complaint with your local law enforcement. They can't do anything on this interaction, but it will establish a paper trail. This is critical if the friend's actions continue. Explain why you are making the report (paper trail, obvious stalking predatory behavior) and that you understand they can't make an arrest. (Cops get annoyed because people always want them to arrest people who haven't done anything to be arrested for).\n\n\nHopefully, you and BF can work something out to address this predatory person. \n\nStay safe and stay alert.

And then, either send him a message detailing what happened and not taking him back until he apologizes, or just kick him to the curb.\n\nBut whatever you do, PLEASE don't let them convince you that you were just imagining things, and stay away from Matt at all costs.

Win win! And continue the 911 call even if/when they do leave you alone, report what happened.", "Don't, Jon has shown you the kind of person he is. Even if he wasn't in on this, which I personally believe theres a good chance he was. But even if he wasn't, by completely disregarding your concerns and not seeing how reasonable it is to take issue with what his friend did, he is showing how skewed his perceptions are. If he thinks that what Matt did is fine, he's clueless or intentionally ignoring the danger women experience from this pattern of behavior from men. At this point, I'd say Jon is a loss. Move on and protect yourself.", "And Jon is relying on that to manipulate you. I'd be certain about that if he has some idea that you really can't stand conflict and just agree to anything to avoid it. The silent treatment is very manipulative. Jon's reaction would be a dealbreaker for me.\n\nLow self-esteem? Maybe consider CBT? It was brilliant for me. Very useful if you are OK asking yourself and making yourself answer difficult questions and confront difficult memories. It helped me set boundaries and feel OK expecting better for myself.", "Huge red flags here OP...Jon has put his predator pal Matt ahead of you", "Nah, you shouldn't miss that pile of hot garbage.  Just toss him out and wash your hands of this whole group.", "No guy who doesn't take no for an answer should be called a \"good person\" IMO", "A good person would have understood your concern and not taken offense. Granted, a noncreep good person wouldn't have done what he did. Even in an emergency it wouldn't have gone down the way it did. It only escalated to that when nothing else worked to get into your house. \n\nAnd catching you on a trail late at night is easy cover to hurt you and get away with it in the dark and isolation without you for sure having known who he was.  \n\nINFO what was he wearing? Dark colors? Type of clothing? Idk, I feel like this could also be another indicator of intentions combined with all the other flags, too.", "You\u2019re not crazy for being scared at all. John is crazy for thinking any of this is normal. \nIf my friend had shown up to my SO\u2019s house in the middle of the night, and they hadn\u2019t let them in, I\u2019d fully understand that. \n\nJohn is weird\nMatt is weird \n\nYou are not safe around either of them. John not talking to you at all for a week over this is \ud83d\udea9 behavior as well. \n\nNTA\n\nAs painful as it is (because you\u2019ve had a year long relationship with this man) I agree with everyone else here, let him go.", "\"I was crazy for being scared\" - again, gaslighting. \nGirl, run.", "This is one of those gift of fear moments. \n\nDon't let him know where you are. He's a predator and he was trying to rape you.", "...Candygram.", "\u201cTelegram\u2026\u201d", "To be honest....that sounds sketchy. It sounds like your bf knew what was going to happen and is upset you thwarted the plan.", "When he contacts you, don't pick up.", "I agree with everyone saying this is creepy and well done for not letting him in. \n\nIt's also not okay that your boyfriend doesn't seem to care about this incident and how you feel.\n\nAnd I wanted to add that ignoring you for a week is a huge red flag in my opinion, mature adults don't need to ghost their partner to sort their issues out. Communication is key and this guy you're dating sounds like an ass hat with dangerous friends.", "Don't even meet with him again and never allow yourself to be alone with Matt. Even if you did overreact (which you definitely did not), your boyfriend has proven that he doesn't care about you feeling safe. If that is not a giant red flag, I don't know what is.", "remember to pepper spray first and ask questions later.", "She probably needs permission from her building\u2019s management to change the locks.  Good stuff to know though, thanks!", "Oh I bet that \"dad how do I\" YouTube channel has a video on how to do it", "With a dead phone battery, apparently.", "No, the gathering was at her boyfriend's place.", "Can I wash it? No? Maybe it's broken haha! Still no? Oh look my.phone is also dead hahaha, no? Then I'm just going to aggressively buzz and then bitch to John, take that!\n\nGood lord this whole story gave me chills. Matt is NOT a safe person.", "Agree completely. OP please read **The Gift of Fear**. It will help you put your self doubt to rest.", "Dang. So harsh. And so true. omg. Thanks for that.", "I hate the word \"creepy.\" But, yeah. Dude was being creepy guy.", "\"Well, if you won't let me in, do you mind calling for help?\"\n\nThis MF did not need help, or he woulda led with it and been focused on getting it - not getting inside while OP was home alone at night.", "Dudes often don't see the predatory behavior of their friends. Is it possible he's in on it? Sure. Is it possible he's just completely clueless about how creepy his friend is? Also yes.", "Just not at midnight on Friday.", "Seriously. Plus if he really had been hurt\u2014 emergency level hurt with a possibly *broken* knee then he would have led with that. Not, \u201cHey, I thought I would bump into you!\u201d Dumbass. What creepy bullshit.", "I read a study that showed about 5% of men will admit to being rapists if you don\u2019t use the word in the survey. They asked have you ever had sex through the use of force or the threat of force. And those were the 5% dumb enough not to realize what the question was asking, so the real number is probably higher.", "Exactly! \nAnd because they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be a woman and alert all the time for any potential predatory behaviour, out of necessity, then they simply cannot empathise with women. \n\nGood men do try to understand however and listen to the women in their lives, working hard to make sure we feel safe and *are* in fact safe from other men. \n\nGuys like OP\u2019s boyfriend are self centred and obtuse in their blatant unwillingness to even try to understand.. it takes effort to put your yourself into someone else\u2019s shoes - & this guy is too lazy to do that.", "Just not at midnight on a Friday.", "Never said it was once just that she only met him 3 months ago and then he came to a party at her place. He\u2019s still the creepy creeper. If some dude showed up at my place late at night he\u2019d be not let in. Seems like guy didn\u2019t even have her phone number just knew where she lived from the party. Ick.", "Read it again, a few weeks later Matt came to her place which is where he brought up jogging in the neighbourhood", "\u201cA few weeks later i had a gathering at my place and Matt came\u201d. Fifth sentence of the post. That\u2019s when he asked her about jogging.", "Yes, please. His behavior fits right in with the predators like not accepting no for an answer. I am so glad OP protected herself from the beginning with this dude.", "I second this. It\u2019s an amazing book. Totally with the time to read- and you will learn a lot about the world and yourself while reading it.", "I cannot recommend this book enough. Stumbled across it in my high-school library and it was what I needed to get away from my abusers. I keep a copy in mint condition with the full intention of having my kid read it when she's older.", "Great recommendation also wanted to add, OP please do not jog on the trail alone anymore. \n\nAt least not for a long while. I know that is unfair and inconvenient but safety has to be your priority.", "Lol I was thinking Brand New, but FOB works too!", "This!  This seemed really odd. Why\u2019d it take a year to meet his friends? So weird.", "They don't follow up rapes in many places. They're not going to haul someone in for unsuccessfully making a single attempt to stalk them. Mores the pity.", "He dismisses your (legit!) concerns and ghosts you for a week? Jon hasn't exactly covered himself in glory here. I would say cut your losses and move on. Chalk this one up to a lucky escape. You deserve better.", "You haven\u2019t heard from him in a week after his friend harassed & stalked you. He\u2019s gaslighting you, diminishing your trauma. He\u2019s now using emotional abuse to get you in line. \n\nYou need to realize that it could kill you to trust humans that don\u2019t deserve it. Your EX should not be trusted. \n\nConsider this a gift & gtf away from that man, he will harm you one way or the other, he\u2019s already proven that by everything he\u2019s done since you told him you were stalked and harassed by his friend. \n\nChange the locks, CHANGE YOUR JOGGING ROUTINE - change times & change routes, change starting & ending points, and keep them changing. Tbh, any fem presenting human that runs or walks outside regularly using your tried & true route/s should switch up their routines. For the benefit of not being predictable but also bc you become more trusting of your route and surroundings & are less aware and on guard the more comfortable you are in your routine. \n\nTake care of you OP.", "He probably wasn\u2019t. But men not believing women and refusing to call out their friends when they behave in ways that threaten women is exactly why you had to not let him in.\nIf more men challenged their friends over lower level stuff it would be easier to spot the potential of assault. \nWell done for staying safe. \nHopefully your next boyfriend is a decent human. x", "You seriously need to dump the idiot. Even if he was not in on it, he is a disgusting idiot for taking his friend's side in this obvious attempt at \"seduction\" / rape. And the way he handled the situation, even if the friend's story had been true, is a huge red flag.", "NTA but OP, there are so many replies telling you Matt is a creep and your boyfriend is at best an ignorant buffoon and worst, fully aware of Matt\u2019s predatory behaviour. \n\nYou are 31 years old. However much you think you love Jon, his actions are telling you who he is. Believe him. He hasn\u2019t contacted you? So what? Let the trash take themselves  out.", "The fact that Jon was more upset with you than his pervy friend trying to get with you in the middle of the night should tell you everything. Don\u2019t stay with this guy!\n\nAlso please update us if you can / want! This has me quite worried. Please tell me Jon doesn\u2019t have a key to your place?!", "More like such an emergency that she had to let him in but not enough of an emergency so he could still walk on the leg to her home lol", "Try doing a google reverse image search of the picture. Of course he could have just wrapped a bandage around his non-hurt knee, but it\u2019s worth a shot.", "If he knee was broken he would of been screaming in pain. This dude is full of shit and sketchy as hell", "At first he said his knee was hurt and needed to clean it, and after she said no, he said it was broken", "I see thx", "Ohhhh okay. Thanks.", "Exactly THIS!! The whole thing gave off extreme Ted Bundy vibes!! But the only other alternative is that Matt thought you were cleverly propositioning him when you said Friday at midnight. Bootie call. And so he showed up and then did some role play and then got pissed and told John so he\u2019d be the first story John heard. And no way would John ask to see the knee. I\u2019m willing to bet that if you let this slide, Matt will pretty quickly accuse you of coming on to him. None of which is your fault. Men are freaking clueless about how women feel about being approached.", "I agree. The whole thing is friggin creepy. \n\nI was recently watching a video about staying safe as a woman. The woman talking was saying that statistically men are unlikely to ask a woman for help when they need it. The ones who do genuinely need help will simply move on to the next available person, but men who persist likely have ulterior motives. Even if that's trying to hit on you.\n\nFor this guy to show up at OP's house in the middle of the night, when:\n\nShe said she would be jogging \n\nInjured\n\nAND, his phone is mysteriously dead\n\nIt's too coincidental. Too unlikely to be believed. Also, his knee was suddenly injured ONLY when she wouldn't let him in or join him on a jog? Hell no, it's suspect. And...how did he know where she lived exactly? Was the party she met him at HER house? I didn't get that impression, but at least it would explain how he found her. Knowing what trail she runs on isn't synonymous with her address. How did he track her down?\n\nEven if we look at this as the least likely situation.. He's awkward. Didn't realize how creepy it would look for OP. But once she said no to letting him in, he should have backed way off. Any good man would. Any decent PERSON would back off when they realized they were making someone uncomfortable, making them feel unsafe. Instead this dude ran to the boyfriend to complain. The boyfriend's reaction is sus too. She should ditch them both because something is wrong here!", "Block them, maybe change your locks if Jon could possibly have made a copy of your key. Consistently make sure all your doors and windows are locked.", "oooo, i didn\u2019t even have the thought of matt claiming op would come onto him if she let this slide. you are a very smart one, that\u2019s clever. and he probably would bc he seems like a weirdo.", "I thought the gathering was at Jon's place", "There was another one after that at her place."]}
