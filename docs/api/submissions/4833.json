He asked when do I usually go. For some reason I lied and said \u201cAround midnight on Friday nights\u201d. I meant it as a joke because to me it seems absurd to jog at midnight alone.\nFast forward to last Friday. I was in my apartment almost sleeping and I heard my door buzzing. I answered it and it was Matt he said (not word from word) \u201cHeyyyy you\u2019re home! That\u2019s great I thought I would\u2019ve seen you jogging\u201d I was confused because he didn\u2019t tell me who he was. Once I worked it out I just said that I was tired and heading to bed and I wished him a good night he stopped me and said \u201cActually I hurt my knee pretty badly, do you think I can come up to wash it?\u201d I said no and informed him that there was a 7-11 nearby and he could go there. He laughed and said \u201cit\u2019s an emergency and I want to be with a friend, also it would be broken\u201d I told him to call and ambulance. He told me that his phone died and he would also like to charge it. By this point I was annoyed and flat out said \u201cNo\u201d.

I was scared for about an hour but eventually went to sleep. I woke up the next day and checked my phone. I had several text and calls from Jon calling me an asshole for not trusting Matt.

One excuse after another, to get you to open your door. Nope. Not happening.", "NTA. Holy shit. He definitely wasn\u2019t out for a run and a photo of a bandage is super easy to fake. He was a practical stranger trying to get you alone in the middle of the night in your home. He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and came up with a bunch of excuses to weasel his way in after you repeatedly said no. He\u2019s not just an AH but he\u2019s also a creep. Your bf is also and AH for taking his side and not seeing this for what it is. Ask him for a picture *without* the bandage. You won\u2019t get one. Keep in mind continuing to see you BF may mean having to see this creep continuously in the future.", "NTA, that whole situation is sketchy. You were around him for a year and just now meeting his friends? To me that\u2019s a little odd but to each their own.

It's really suspicious that he showed up out of the blue and so late like that, and you were absolutely right not to let him into the house! For all you know, it could have been a ruse and it's weird that you only met a couple of times and he's referring to you as his \"friend.\" Just because your boyfriend trusts him, doesn't mean you should or have to when you barely even know him.

This whole situation feels very odd! If his knee was in such bad shape it could possibly be broken, how did he get to your house and why wasn't that the first thing he said? Why is he laughing and joking instead of asking immediately for help or for you to call an ambulance? Did you offer and he brushed it off, and why didn't he ask you to call one if his phone is dead?

It's extremely unlikely that he just happened to end up outside your apartment late on a Friday night with an injured knee and a dead phone. At best, he's a creep who was hoping he could put the moves on you once he was alone with you. At worst, he's a dangerous predator. Anybody can put a bandage on their leg after the fact. Your boyfriend is also TA for not supporting you in this, and him enabling Matt's creepy behaviour is an enormous red flag for him as well. It might be time to reconsider this relationship. You did the right thing.", "You are definitely NTA.

AH. \nBuh bye, Jon", "Ooof I would have been scared too! The guy sounds overbearing at best and sinister at worst.   If your boyfriend thinks you\u2019re supposed to let creepy guys in your house late at night, and doesn\u2019t even want to hear your side of it, then he doesn\u2019t sound like he cares about you.

Do you really want to be with someone like that? You can do much better.", "10000% NTA. Good for you for trusting your gut.\n\nAlso, consider dumping Jon while you're at it. If he doesn't understand why you wouldn't let a very insistent/potentially aggressive dude that you barely know into your apartment, late at night, after you expressed your discomfort.. then you really need to evaluate if you want that type of partner longterm - especially if he's giving you the silent treatment because he thinks you overreacted.", "NTA!! Your boyf is TA for not understanding how creepy Matt is!", "NTA", "NTA.  I still would not believe his story if I were you.  It's possible he put a bandage on without actually being hurt.  How else would he make you into a bad guy.", "NTA, creepy situation and I would have slammed the door way faster. I probably wouldn\u2019t even open it tbh", "NTA.  Matt really set off some creep, stalker vibes.  Did he say that he normally jogs at midnight?  \n\nThe most you could have done was call 911 and get that ambulance for him.\n\nGood for you for standing your ground and not letting him in.  Your BF needs to understand that as a woman and for your own safety, you are not going to invite someone into your home in the middle of the night that you barely know.", "NTA and that sounds creepy as hell and something as to how not to be murdered", "NTA, you really don\u2019t know him, everything he was saying was sketchy.  I wouldn\u2019t have opened the door.", "NTA. You have to trust your gut. This whole thing is super creepy.", "Absolutely NTA. Keep trusting your instincts, OP. You did the right thing. PS, ditch your boyfriend.", "NTA  So many red flags!! They're the assholes for expecting you to let into your house a virtual stranger at midnight. Lose Matt and Jon for that matter.", "NTA...that is soooo super weird.  I would have been very creeped out too.  If your BF can't empathize with your feelings here, that's concerning.  I wouldn't let an aquintance in my house super late at night.", "Holy creeper much. He was literally looking for you. Murder shows tell me he was going to attack you on that job or attempt to if he was let into your place. Good bye to both guys. Yikes\n\nNTA", "Just reading this gave me chills.\nYou were really smart lying to him in the first place and then not opening the door in the second.\nI bet whatever you want that he doesn't have anything under these bandages and honestly: better loosing a boyfriend then having such a psycho in your life!\nDoes he even live in your area tgat he joggs there??\nPsycho!\n\nNTA. Not for a second. If you let him in and he assaulted you, who would your boyfriend believe in?", "NTA.  Matt is a creepy lying asshole.  If it was about his 'injury' he would have led with that.   It was a pretext to get into your home.   That's how dateline episodes start.  Hard pass.

Frankly your boyfriend is a idiot anyone who clearly loves someone would've said wait hold up you knocked at my girlfriends apartment at midnight over a knee injury. And why the hell did you go running at midnight after she jokingly told you midnight are you trying to get at her cause that's plain creepy. If I ever hear that again we've got a huge problem \n\nHad a similar experience when dating my now husband I was visiting on a trip to see him staying at his place with his young son during the day while he worked. Some random dude starts hammering at the front door yelling for my now partner. At the time he was just a bf so I'm at the door this guy's all hey I need to come in and wait for *name*. I'm confused as hell he's jumping around I need to come in it's an emergency, I need to see *name* it's urgent I'm hurt, walked x miles as he's the closest person I know in the area. Can I just come in. I politely said I'm sorry I don't know who you are, I've never met you *name has never said who you are in relation to him* I have a kid with me you are not coming in. He starts whining that it's hot, his feet hurt and that he's desperate and has nowhere else to go , and that \"everyone\" knows who he is. I am not everyone I don't know you and  said if is that important call him but I doubt he will answer unless  your truly a friend or wait outside under a tree till he comes home and he'll take it from there. He of course couldn't the guy was strung off his face, I had to call my partners mom  because I was so nervous and gave a description of him she immediately drove to mine and basically told him to *go somewhere else as he was also known to her* the guy was a junkie and addict and an ex family member. The emergency he wanted was to ask my partner to go get his car out of impound so he could go get more drugs or booze. I apologized so much. If said the guy was sketchy as hell, obviously on something and he's fighting tooth and nail to get into your house and it scared the chyt out of me. I have your kid I'm alone and there's a strange man expecting me to just let him in \n\nYou know what my partner said I'm sorry he creeped you out and I'm so  glad you said no, I know him but you didn't if I was here he would've been let in only because of xyz.  He could've been anyone but you did the right thing called mom, let me know and triple locked everything. I'm glad you decided to keep him waiting outside.", "NTA and that friend is a creep.

He first went jogging when he hoped you would be out and about. And when you weren't, he decided to go bother you at your place likely knowing full well that Jon wasn't there. He then changed tactics from trying to invite himself in to claiming he was injured and NEEDED in immediately.

I commend you for not letting his best friend in.  I absolutely believe his was lying about his knee and a bandage means nothing. \n\nYou did not overreact.  You trusted your instinct - don't doubt yourself.\n\nThe main issue moving forward is your boyfriend.  I'm not sure what will happen with him.  His response of \"don't contact him until he's ready to talk\" is not a good sign.  He's choosing his best friend over you.  Now, don't get me wrong....you've been dating less than a year.  I'm not a fan of dumping your friends after 3 months or something like that when you start dating someone.  Most likely, your relationship isn't likely at the point that friends/family are \"second tier\" in priority if that makes sense.  And that's okay.\n\nBut the fact he isn't willing to talk to you, to hear your side of the story....that's a big problem.  It's basically a snapshot of what a future relationship would be like.  If a difficult situation arises, he's not going to talk.  He's going to pick a side.  Great if it's you - in this case it's not you.\n\nRespect his request....and take this time apart to evaluate your relationship.  Try to take a step back and look objectively....this is not easy for anyone.  Is this someone that you could possibly see having children with? (if you desire children).  Is this someone you know you can count on for support when bad things happen (losing a job, developing long term health problems, etc). \n\nBest wishes for you.", "Nta ! You did not overreact!

As I was reading the story I had a chill going up my spine.  I think you really dodged a bullet by not letting this man into your house.  If he were really injured he would have said that first thing and asked for help.  And that his phone was dead is just too much of a coincidence.  Also creepy that he remembered your saying that you jog at night and suddenly appearing.  What does he want with you, and why was he so eager to get inside your house? At best he\u2019s intrusive, pushy, and inappropriate. At worst\u2026 well this isn\u2019t far from the way rapists and serial killers behave.  Be very careful.  Trust your instincts!

Jogging at midnight IS weird, and for Matt to *just so happe * to be out at that time? Give me a brake. I would have been sleeved out my damn mind. \n\nHonestly, Matt seems like he won't take no for an answer, and being alone with him in your house could have gotten real rapey real quick.

Protect yourself from them both and be wary going forward.", "NTA. Believe us, believe us! You made a good decision and stuck to it. The fact he continued to invent reasons to be let in is really off and you were right not to be swayed. The boyfriend might not be a keeper. If he's giving you the big freeze over this, then he both does not understand how women need to take care of themselves (red flag #1) and isn't strong enough to distance himself (let alone rebuke and correct) from his friend in your defence (red flag #2).

One that includes this face. \n\nAlso point out that Matt said it might be broken when he probably wouldn't be able to walk on it if it was.  He tried every excuse he could think of to get in there so it is very likely that he was up to no good.  \n\nIf your BF doesn't trust you or understand why you wouldnt want to have a near stranger in your home in the middle of the night then break up with him now.", "OP=NTA\n\nThat is just creepy.

He\u2019s shown you who he is, I would believe that and count yourself lucky that it\u2019s come out now, rather than later.\n\nYou 100% did the right thing. \nMy bet is he would have tried to hit on you, done something untoward and then told Jon it was all you, and Jon probably would have believed him.", "NTA each time you responded with a no he came up with another excuse to get into your apartment. If he had all of those issues he would\u2019ve stated all of them at the same time but he didn\u2019t.  Having  a Band-Aid on your knee doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re actually hurt.

I would have been scared to let someone I hardly know into my home late at night.  It sounded strange to me.", "NTA as you laid this story out.

NTA, just cautious and alert, as you should have been in that situation.", "He didn't mention his \"injury\" initially. It was just, Hey! I was looking for you, and now I'm at your front door. When you didn't let him in, then he suddenly had an injury...and when you said no, he suddenly had a phone problem. He initially laughed when mentioning his \"injury,\" but then escalated to it might be broken. He was doing his level best to manipulate you into letting him in.\n\nHe was exhibiting classic predator ploys, and for your BF to ignore that is more than a little troubling. \n\nNTA. Not even close.", "So let me get this straight... Matt's first tactic is to act like he was just out jogging at the obviously sarcastic time you said you jog, and wondered what you were up to since he didn't see you out jogging (why was he out looking for you?). \n\nWhen that didn't work, he said he'd hurt his knee and wanted to clean it right then and there instead of just, idk, going home and dealing with it? If it's hurt that badly wouldn't you be finished your jog anyway? \n\nAnd when THAT didn't work, he said it might be broken, even though (I assume, based on your description) he didn't seem in pain at all and was standing normally? If it was hurt enough that he thought it might be broken, why wasn't that the first thing out of his mouth when you answered the door? And why was he trying to use that as an excuse to come in, when he really should go to the hospital (either figuring out a ride himself or by ambulance like you suggested, except oh wait his phone's conveniently dead and instead of just asking to borrow your phone to call a ride he wanted to come in for several minutes to charge it). I'm surprised at that point he didn't insist you needed to drive him to the hospital... except of course he didn't ask you to, because it was never about getting help for an injury. It was about coming into your apartment, where you were alone. \n\nAbsolutely NTA, you were smart and listened to your gut. This reads like one of the milder stories on Let's Not Meet. Ugh.", "Nope. Not an over reaction. I\u2019ve seen this episode and it often doesn\u2019t end well for the woman home alone in the middle of the night. And if your boyfriend is one that discourages you from listening to your gut in situations where your safety is concerned then I\u2019d be reevaluating that immediately. NTA", "NTA. Go with your gut.

So this guy knew OP lived alone.\n\n And thought she\u2019d be alone on this running trail, in the dark, around midnight, and when she wasn\u2019t, he knew where to find her and knew she\u2019s be home alone.", "And why was he doing this at the very time that OP had facetiously said she went jogging around there? And then he started by trying to talk about that, so clearly he\u2019d been deliberately trying to find her out jogging at midnight.", "\ud83d\ude0a thank you. I just wish Jon would talk to me at least", "Jon agreed that I was crazy for being scared\nHe said Matt was a good person \nHe probably is but idk", "They should also get a copy of the book, \u201cThe Gift of Fear,\u201d and read it.  Invaluable!", "It sounded weird. If anything he should\u2019ve called Jon and had Jon meet him at my place \n\nJon lives only a few miles away", "I was wondering if I was overreacting because I do watch true crime \nJon mentioned that I let the shows mess with my  logic \nIt\u2019s been almost a week and he still won\u2019t talk to me", "Or he'd blame her instead. \"Why did you let him into your house in the first place? Maybe you really cheated on me with him and are now falsely accusing him of rape because you feel guilty for it.\" That type of bullshit.", "If something it happened, and she had gotten hurt, Jon wouldn\u2019t have believed her. He seems like the type of guy who always takes his friends\u2019 side, so I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve found a way to either not believe her or make it her fault.\n\nOP, dump Jon. You don\u2019t need that shit in your life, or his shit friends.", "Exactly. The whole thing is sketch AF, starting with jogging with you, even in broad daylight. I've ended up in a much scarier situation and he also used the \"but I'm your boyfriend's friend\" bs. Thankfully he took my reaction seriously and backed off. Trust your spidey sense. A decent person would feel bad that you were frightened if it was all so innocent. Which it most certainly was not.", "Men who aren\u2019t afraid of being r*ped by a random stranger run without a full charge at night.  Even if this is completely innocent (it is not) it just shows the privilege men move through the world with", "Yea it was just a close up of a bandage. So face in it", "Like too creepy! If it was a random afternoon and he led with \u201cI hurt my knee can you come down and help me\u201d. That would be kind of understandable at least. \n\nBut going out at the same time she goes out in the hopes of \u201crunning into her\u201d in itself is super creepy. No one runs at that time, unless you have a really bizarre schedule. He was setting something up.", "Glad you said this!  I was thinking it but doubted myself.  Matt is like some character out of a bad stalker movie.  Jon just so happens to be unavailable.  And then Jon is angry with OP but without any understanding of why anyone wouldn\u2019t just do it what the person at the door wanted.\n\nFor me, a relationship ender to be sure.", "I don't think it's that much of a stretch.  Jon's reaction is completely wrong for someone who cares about his GF--I was thinking that myself, but decided I'd said enough with \"predatory\".", "Call an ambulance like a normal person. If he was really hurt that badly, he wouldn't have jogged all the way to her place.", "Not go to a woman\u2019s house at midnight and demand to be let in for one. Accept no for an answer the first time. Or better yet realize how scary that can be for a woman and not ask to be let in at all at any time.\n\nETA: go to a pharmacy, public bathroom, or urgent care to take care of your own needs.", "My spidey sense says run", "Even if he does, please be cautious--you could honestly be in danger here and no one wants you to be a statistic.", "John has shown you who he is.  Believe him.", "Let him go. For all you know, they planned this together. It happens.", "The fact that he thinks you were in the wrong is pathetic..", "Honestly, don't bother. The silent treatment is an incredibly manipulative tactic. He wants you to feel terrible and crawl back, but you have absolutely nothing to apologize for and it sounds like you are dodging a bullet.", "Jon was in on it. Or will believe his buddy over you.\n\nEither way... good riddance. You don't want somebody whose first reaction to this story is berate you instead of asking if you're OK.", "Why? He berated you because you called his friend out for sketchy behavior. He thought you should put yourself in a dangerous situation. Fuck that shit, he's not a keeper.", "Dont waste your time. This guy has shown you who he is.\n\nSomeone not taking no for answer is wrong on all levels.\n\n\nAsk yourself if Matt is a predator and your boyfriend stood up for him. What exactly does that make Him?\n\n\nNta block your ex boyfriend", "Yeah no. He would be ok with his friend going to his partners place at 12 am when you barely even know them. Your feelings should be above his friend\u2019s feelings in this situation. He\u2019s shown you who he chooses to side with on this matter. Matt\u2019s comfort and opinion matter more than yours. Sorry hun. You are definitely NTA", "Please don't forget that he was out running at a time that he expected you would be! That in itself is very creepy! Even if he was legitimately hurt, he was deliberately trying to run into you without asking you about it first.\n\nTrust your instincts, you did the right thing! If Jon can't understand why you would make the choices you did, then he doesn't deserve you. You are NTA in any way.", "People thought Jeffrey Dahmer was a good person too.\n\nYou are not crazy for being scared.  You did the right thing.\n\nDon't trust Jon or Matt.", "Ask any guy how many rapists he knows, and the answer will be none- none of his friends would do that. And yet the statistics for how many women have experienced some kind of sexual assault are so high that it seems nearly impossible that all of these men know nobody that would do such a thing. The reality is that they are men and not women, so their friends have never been creepy, inappropriate, or assaulted them and until it happens to you you never really know.", "It doesn't matter. You did the safe thing. You offered him a solution. It may have been cool to offer to place a call for him if he didn't have his phone but that by itself is sketchy. His entire behavior is sketchy. You did what you were supposed to and tried to contact help. A policy of I don't open the door in weird situations is a very good one. If he was really hurt when you offered to call the police he should have been glad if he needed help urgently. This is very dangerous.", "Matt is not a good person. Trust your original instincts.", "I could easily see both sides. Maybe he was like hey this is my buddy's girl and if I see her out jogging we can become friends too. Maybe he really did get hurt and doesn't realize how creepy and off-putting everything he did was. Perhaps...or perhaps he was being creepy trying to meet his friends gf outside along or any of the more sinister things people have suggested. At the end of the day your instincts and fears took priority over niceness. Most men won't ever understand the fear you have a woman with stuff like this. Heck some woman don't even get it. You did nothing wrong. You might get a chance to explain it to Jon and he may or may not understand. If he doesn't or you don't get the chance then you learned something valuable. You deserve someone who, even if they don't understand it, trust that your sense of safety is more important than a knee scrape.", "Look at it this way -- a really \"good\" person would understand how creepy Matt's behavior was. If Matt were a good guy who just happened to go running and hurt his knee at that hour, he'd say, \"Oh, sh\\*t, that must have really freaked OP out to have a guy she hardly knows show up like that. I need to apologize. Good for her for looking out for herself.\" That's what an actual decent guy would do. Not complain to your boyfriend. Not get mad at you for being careful. \n\nA human predator's #1 move is to try to make you feel guilty for not \"being nice.\" \n\nAnd your bf's behavior is ringing alarm bells, too. Stay safe, OP.", "Jon is not realizing most victims are victimized by people they know", "You don't know if Matt's a good guy meeting him just a couple times. The way he behaved showing up like he did sounds scary af and unsafe. NTA. Statistically  speaking that was more likely to go sideways than a random stranger being around you is. Jon has shown he's going to side with Matt over you. Cut your losses and get all the way out from that whole circle.", "This! Everyone should read that book!", "...does John know what time you jog? Might want to switch it up.", "Or like be an adult and go home not knocking at your door in the middle of the night.  This is all suspicious behaviour and your bf is also a creep to side with his sketchy friends. I would dump him if I was in your shoes having to interact with shady ppl. NTA", "Yup and if his phone really was dead why didn\u2019t he open with \u201chey my phone is dead, can you call Jon for me?\u201d He only had phone problems after you shot down his other reasons for not letting him in.", "Well fuck Jon. Safety first babe, we just met Matt and don't know anything about him. He has no reason coming to your house in the middle of the night, after admitting he was waiting for you (I'm sure he would have reached out first and see if you're okay with it like a normal person would), the. Say he got hurt, refuse hospital service, and then tell Jon all about it.\n\nIt's better to be safe than sorry.", "Those shows could have very well saved your life. Jon is not worth this.", "I'm also I'm interested in true crime and listen to a variety of podcasts.  One thing I hear over and over is to trust your instincts! Many people (especially women) ignore their instincts for the sake of being polite or not causing a fuss.  And then bad things happen.  \n\nEven if he didn't have bad intentions (which i highly doubt) his reaction and your boyfriends reaction is a red flag by itself. Why would you let someone that's pretty much a stranger into your home at that time of night? I know it's easy for a random internet stranger to say,  but you might be better off without this guy.", "True crime is how we learn and develop safety mechanisms for creeps.", "Sounds like your boyfriend wants you to get hurt... icky", "This is right.  You were set up.  No matter what you did, you would have been blamed.  Making you feel guilty, sorry, awful was the objective.", "That\u2019s an excellent point. Any normal person would\u2019ve realized they were scaring OP and would have felt bad. The fact that this creep had the nerve to complain about OP screams bad intentions. I was uncomfortable just reading about their interaction.", "That story is suspicions especially his response, someone proactively sending pictures of bandages to get sympathy and rile up your boyfriend is predatory behavior. It puts the blame on you instead of explaining to his friend, why he was waiting for his best friend's girlfriend at midnight? That is scary, always trust your instincts. Get a new boyfriend with better friends.", "OP think about it - First he asks you to go for a run and then immediately says that his knee is hurt and needs to clean it up right away like it's gushing blood!!! That right there should tell you that you didn't overreact and he was trying to get inside your house and thank goodness you were smart enough to not let him. Do not let Jon's reaction make you think otherwise. You most likely were going to be a victim of assault in one way or another!! Your instincts just saved your life!!!", "Along the same lines, it seems strange that they\u2019ve been together for almost a year but he just introduced her to his best friend a few months ago. How well does he even know Matt? Doesn\u2019t sound like a longtime friendship.", "Shouldn't op go to the police? If you are saying this guy and her boyfriend of one year are planning to like attack op. Why shouldng she go to the police with all this evidence", "That\u2019s actually a good point. He had to climb up a little hill too to get to my building \n\nI didn\u2019t even think of this", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Omg planned what? Op should go to the police", "I was going to say the same thing about Ted Bundy.", "You are so right. Thank you. I don\u2019t know why I have this guilt", "The whole story is sketchy AF.", "Have you ever heard of people have someone try to lure their partner (or child) into an unsafe situation?  And then have that person scare the crap out of them.  To, you know, educate them about personal safety.  (Warped beyond belief but it does happen).  This sounds like an attempt at that.\n\nOr Matt is a predator just learning his craft\u2026", "Because there is no actual evidence. It's sketchy as hell and a real possibility. But there's no proof to any nefarious means", "In my view, BF is now an ex.  Whether he was planning something or he was simply unconcerned with the safety of OP.\n\nIf you tell a detective in sex crimes this story, they would almost certainly say Matt\u2019s behavior is exceedingly suspect.  And that she almost certainly at risk.  But Matt never had an opportunity to commit the crime.  So what about an inchoate offense?  \n\nAlmost impossible to prove without a witness or some sort of electronic or written account of what he planned to do.  Matt\u2019s new story might go something like this:  Jon was very concerned about her safety and how trusting she was of strangers.  He asked me to see if I could talk my way in.  I was concerned that I was unsuccessful I would be seen as a creeper.  If I was successful, I would simply say you are lucky that I wasn\u2019t a threat.  If I wasn\u2019t successful, Jon agreed to come to my defense.  Obviously, he never wanted her to know that he asked someone to trick me.\n\nOr something like this:  I thought she was very cute.  When she shared she jogged at midnight, I took that as an invitation to just meet her on the trail.  I really just wanted to talk with her so when I didn\u2019t see on the trail, I went to her apartment.  I had fallen and asked for help.  She didn\u2019t want to help so I left.", "Exactly! If it was so minor that he made it up that hill then it was just an excuse to make a late-night stop there cuz he knew you'd be up possibly or jogging... \n\nI sorta get why he thought you wouldn't mind cuz he's known you for 3 months now but he's also a guy and many live in the safe bubble they get for being dudes. They don't understand how scary it is to have a man show up at your door that late so in turn, don't realize how creepy they're being. This would be a great moment to educate (but I digress and it shouldn't be your job to educate him).", "Also stay safe near Jon. He doesn\u2019t seem very trustworthy at the moment.", "If it's a small gash then just go home... it's super fucking creepy to come to a woman's house you barely know in the middle of the night.", "Sounds like a set up for a robbery.", "Can't charge someone if nothing bad happened... But I agree OP should get out this feels so wrong. My SO would flip if one of his mates did this. Just scary.", "Because this entire thing seems designed to test your boundaries and train you into not listening to your own warnings. It is absolutely normal to do what you did. They are pushing you into apologizing to throw you off balance. It's frankly very worrying", "Because women are trained to feel bad when they \"rock the boat\" (aka \"don't go along to get along.\") This is how date rape happens.\n\nMatt and Jon are using that mentality to their benefit. Don't let them.", "Also OP\u2026 how did he know where you live/what apartment was yours!? And how did he send a photo of his injury to ur BF /call BF if his phone was dead\u2026 this guys a creeper", "You need to block Jon and his friend. Boyfriend shouldn\u2019t dismiss your concerns and then ghost you.", "Because women are programmed to be nice. To override their boundaries, their instincts to be non confrontational. Also listen to your instincts and never let anyone breach those boundaries. Lie with dogs, get fleas. Your bf has shown what kind of person he is. Now it depends on you how you handle it. They both aren't nice fyi.", "[deleted]", "Exactly that\u2019s why I would never help another person no matter the circumstances", "She had a gathering at her place it says in the post.", "What?! When was race ever mentioned anywhere in this post? I think you might be projecting... unless I'm missing something here?\n\nEdit: it's creepy that a MAN did it... their race has nothing to do with it", "Or you know, just call the cops.", "What\u2019s wrong with mentioning race ? What does that change", "Not my problem.", "Because no one is talking about it except you... why the hell are you bringing that into this? This is about what a man did creepily to a woman... Quit projecting.", "Just asking you why it's creepy that a black man did it"]}
