We knew each other for a while before we started dating. Anyway he recently started introducing me to his close friends. I met his best friend Matt about three months ago. We are all at a party at Jon\u2019s house. A few weeks later I had a gathering at my place and Matt came. Matt mentioned that he jogs on the path that loops around my place. I said that I did too. He asked when do I usually go. For some reason I lied and said \u201cAround midnight on Friday nights\u201d. I meant it as a joke because to me it seems absurd to jog at midnight alone.\nFast forward to last Friday. I was in my apartment almost sleeping and I heard my door buzzing. I answered it and it was Matt he said (not word from word) \u201cHeyyyy you\u2019re home! That\u2019s great I thought I would\u2019ve seen you jogging\u201d I was confused because he didn\u2019t tell me who he was. Once I worked it out I just said that I was tired and heading to bed and I wished him a good night he stopped me and said \u201cActually I hurt my knee pretty badly, do you think I can come up to wash it?\u201d I said no and informed him that there was a 7-11 nearby and he could go there. He laughed and said \u201cit\u2019s an emergency and I want to be with a friend, also it would be broken\u201d I told him to call and ambulance. He told me that his phone died and he would also like to charge it. By this point I was annoyed and flat out said \u201cNo\u201d. He buzzed my door non-stop for about a minute, I called and texted Jon\u2014with no response.I told him that I would call the police. He replied \u201cwow! What a psycho!\u201d He left. I was scared for about an hour but eventually went to sleep. I woke up the next day and checked my phone. I had several text and calls from Jon calling me an asshole for not trusting Matt. Jon sent me the picture Matt sent him. It was a picture of Matt\u2019s knee with a bandage it. Jon told me not to contact him again until he\u2019s ready to talk.\nNow I wonder if I over reacted", "created_utc": 1671157201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zn3isy/aitah_for_not_letting_my_boyfriends_friend_come/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is freaking predatory behavior and your BF is a total, complete and contributory AH for giving you ANY grief at all for not letting someone you barely know into your apartment in the middle of the night when you are there alone.  So F'ing what he put a bandage on his knee--doesn't prove anything at all, except he staged a picture to justify what he did.  You would do well to lose Jon's contact and never call him again since he has no issue with this.", "NTA. Matt sounds like a creep and you are very smart for not letting him in your home. His behaviors were huge red flags and I would never trust him", "NTA, that was some seriously creepy behavior from Matt and I think you should seriously reconsider your relationship with Jon if he\u2019s going to be siding against you without even hearing your side of the story.", "NTA. Trust your instincts. He used every excuse to try to get inside your house. Your bf also sucks for siding with his sketchy friend. I would run with a friend or switch up my route temporarily. Stay safe OP.", "Run!  Run away from Jon the Creeper Enabler.  \n\nThere is no way I'd let that guy in.  *Maybe* it was innocent.  But it feels more like you'd be needing to call the police for a whole other reason if you'd let him in.\n\nNTA", "NTA - that is sketchy as all get out. One excuse after another, to get you to open your door. Nope. Not happening.", "NTA. Holy shit. He definitely wasn\u2019t out for a run and a photo of a bandage is super easy to fake. He was a practical stranger trying to get you alone in the middle of the night in your home. He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and came up with a bunch of excuses to weasel his way in after you repeatedly said no. He\u2019s not just an AH but he\u2019s also a creep. Your bf is also and AH for taking his side and not seeing this for what it is. Ask him for a picture *without* the bandage. You won\u2019t get one. Keep in mind continuing to see you BF may mean having to see this creep continuously in the future.", "NTA, that whole situation is sketchy. You were around him for a year and just now meeting his friends? To me that\u2019s a little odd but to each their own. But he tried every line in the book to get in to your place, it\u2019s clearly bad news and your bf is clearly in on it I\u2019d say.", "Yeah your spidey sense was right on that one. There\u2019s no doubt he went jogging in the hopes of finding you out on the path. I don\u2019t know what the whole knee thing was, if that was just an unfortunate coincidence, or if he deliberately hurt himself, but you did the right thing. I would not have even answered the door that late. NTA and Jon should know better.\n\nEdit to ask for INFO: where was Jon? Cause if he works nights and Matt knew he wasn\u2019t there, it\u2019s even worse. Did Matt ever ask for Jon?", "NTA follow your instincts.", "NTA. I think we all know what you avoided.", "NTA and the fact your boyfriend doesn\u2019t see a problem with this and is actually placing blame on you is highly problematic to me", "NTA at all! It's really suspicious that he showed up out of the blue and so late like that, and you were absolutely right not to let him into the house! For all you know, it could have been a ruse and it's weird that you only met you a couple of times and he's referring to you as his \"friend.\" Just because your boyfriend trusts him, doesn't mean you should or have to when you barely even know him. Your boyfriend is the asshole for not taking your side, and I'm sure he would've felt extremely guilty if something bad had happened because you trusted this \"friend\" of his.", "NTA. This whole situation feels very odd! If his knee was in such bad shape it could possibly be broken, how did he get to your house and why wasn't that the first thing he said? Why is he laughing and joking instead of asking immediately for help or for you to call an ambulance? Did you offer and he brushed it off, and why didn't he ask you to call one if his phone is dead? Why was he jogging so late with a dead phone? \n\nYou don't know him well and this was a strange situation. You had every right to decide not to let him in.", "Totally NTA, dude sounds fishy as f..", "NTA -- trust your instincts.  And I would dump Jon", "NTA.  Good riddance to Jon, but I'm so sorry he brought someone like that into your life and caused you to doubt yourself.", "NTA. That word that he used about you might be used about himself!", "I tell all my female friends to get a Ring camera- DO NOT open your door", "NTA!!! No no no! This is a huge red flag from Matt. It's extremely unlikely that he just happened to end up outside your apartment late on a Friday night with an injured knee and a dead phone. At best, he's a creep who was hoping he could put the moves on you once he was alone with you. At worst, he's a dangerous predator. Anybody can put a bandage on their leg after the fact. Your boyfriend is also TA for not supporting you in this, and him enabling Matt's creepy behaviour is an enormous red flag for him as well. It might be time to reconsider this relationship. You did the right thing.", "You are definitely NTA. As hard as it might feel to face, Jon does not care that you were scared and freaked out\u2014your partner should be putting your feelings and safety first. He doesn\u2019t want to  hear from you until you\u2019re ready to talk? Sounds like the problem solved itself. Goodbye to both of them, and good riddance.", "NTA \nNo is a full sentence. And who runs without a full charge at night? Ohhh poor baby with an entire bandaid.\n\nYour boyfriend's response is shocking too. You don't know Matt that well and you're in your place alone. Please see that as a red flag", "NTA!  No, you didn\u2019t overreact.  That was creepy af.  Matt is a dangerous AH. The fact that John didn\u2019t have your back?  AH. \nBuh bye, Jon", "Ooof I would have been scared too! The guy sounds overbearing at best and sinister at worst.   If your boyfriend thinks you\u2019re supposed to let creepy guys in your house late at night, and doesn\u2019t even want to hear your side of it, then he doesn\u2019t sound like he cares about you.  NTA", "NTA. Dude was being pushy and creepy. You trusted your gut.", "NTA This guy is obviously a creep. If your boyfriend is going to indefinitely ghost you over this, you should just ignore him when he does try to contact you.", "NTA at all! And what is wrong with your boyfriend that he\u2019s siding with the creepy stalker that showed up at his girlfriend\u2019s house in the middle of the night? Do you really want to be with someone like that? You can do much better.", "10000% NTA. Good for you for trusting your gut.\n\nAlso, consider dumping Jon while you're at it. If he doesn't understand why you wouldn't let a very insistent/potentially aggressive dude that you barely know into your apartment, late at night, after you expressed your discomfort.. then you really need to evaluate if you want that type of partner longterm - especially if he's giving you the silent treatment because he thinks you overreacted.", "NTA!! Your boyf is TA for not understanding how creepy Matt is!", "NTA", "NTA.  I still would not believe his story if I were you.  It's possible he put a bandage on without actually being hurt.  How else would he make you into a bad guy.", "NTA, creepy situation and I would have slammed the door way faster. I probably wouldn\u2019t even open it tbh", "NTA.  Matt really set off some creep, stalker vibes.  Did he say that he normally jogs at midnight?  \n\nThe most you could have done was call 911 and get that ambulance for him.\n\nGood for you for standing your ground and not letting him in.  Your BF needs to understand that as a woman and for your own safety, you are not going to invite someone into your home in the middle of the night that you barely know.", "NTA and that sounds creepy as hell and something as to how not to be murdered", "NTA, you really don\u2019t know him, everything he was saying was sketchy.  I wouldn\u2019t have opened the door.", "NTA. You have to trust your gut. This whole thing is super creepy.", "Absolutely NTA. Keep trusting your instincts, OP. You did the right thing. PS, ditch your boyfriend.", "NTA  So many red flags!! They're the assholes for expecting you to let into your house a virtual stranger at midnight. Lose Matt and Jon for that matter.", "NTA...that is soooo super weird.  I would have been very creeped out too.  If your BF can't empathize with your feelings here, that's concerning.  I wouldn't let an aquintance in my house super late at night.", "Holy creeper much. He was literally looking for you. Murder shows tell me he was going to attack you on that job or attempt to if he was let into your place. Good bye to both guys. Yikes\n\nNTA", "Just reading this gave me chills.\nYou were really smart lying to him in the first place and then not opening the door in the second.\nI bet whatever you want that he doesn't have anything under these bandages and honestly: better loosing a boyfriend then having such a psycho in your life!\nDoes he even live in your area tgat he joggs there??\nPsycho!\n\nNTA. Not for a second. If you let him in and he assaulted you, who would your boyfriend believe in?", "NTA.  Matt is a creepy lying asshole.  If it was about his 'injury' he would have led with that.   It was a pretext to get into your home.   That's how dateline episodes start.  Hard pass. You might want to reevaluate Jon's role in your life if he is giving you a hard time about this wildly reasonable boundary.", "NTA this whole thing sounds like a crime documentary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s something super weird about the fact that your BF waited 9 months to introduce you to his friends and then the basically tried to stalk you.

Glad you got away from both of them!", "NTA whew the dude was blatantly creeping on you and trying to use every line in the book to get access to your apartment and you. Frankly your boyfriend is a idiot anyone who clearly loves someone would've said wait hold up you knocked at my girlfriends apartment at midnight over a knee injury. And why the hell did you go running at midnight after she jokingly told you midnight are you trying to get at her cause that's plain creepy. If I ever hear that again we've got a huge problem \n\nHad a similar experience when dating my now husband I was visiting on a trip to see him staying at his place with his young son during the day while he worked. Some random dude starts hammering at the front door yelling for my now partner. At the time he was just a bf so I'm at the door this guy's all hey I need to come in and wait for *name*. I'm confused as hell he's jumping around I need to come in it's an emergency, I need to see *name* it's urgent I'm hurt, walked x miles as he's the closest person I know in the area. Can I just come in. I politely said I'm sorry I don't know who you are, I've never met you *name has never said who you are in relation to him* I have a kid with me you are not coming in. He starts whining that it's hot, his feet hurt and that he's desperate and has nowhere else to go , and that \"everyone\" knows who he is. I am not everyone I don't know you and  said if is that important call him but I doubt he will answer unless  your truly a friend or wait outside under a tree till he comes home and he'll take it from there. He of course couldn't the guy was strung off his face, I had to call my partners mom  because I was so nervous and gave a description of him she immediately drove to mine and basically told him to *go somewhere else as he was also known to her* the guy was a junkie and addict and an ex family member. The emergency he wanted was to ask my partner to go get his car out of impound so he could go get more drugs or booze. I apologized so much. If said the guy was sketchy as hell, obviously on something and he's fighting tooth and nail to get into your house and it scared the chyt out of me. I have your kid I'm alone and there's a strange man expecting me to just let him in \n\nYou know what my partner said I'm sorry he creeped you out and I'm so  glad you said no, I know him but you didn't if I was here he would've been let in only because of xyz.  He could've been anyone but you did the right thing called mom, let me know and triple locked everything. I'm glad you decided to keep him waiting outside.", "NTA and that friend is a creep. I would change where you run too, he sounds like he would try to catch you outside alone since he couldn\u2019t get inside. Be safe!", "NTA\u2026that is stalker type behavior. You\u2019re better off moving on if your bf does not support you. I mean\u2026dude meets you a few times and tries to run into you randomly, then when that doesn\u2019t work he concocts this story, and then deflects when your bf gets involved.", "Show me your friends, and I'll tell you who you are.", "Maybe this is a stretch, but I could easily see Jon being on this, and he gets off on his friends hooking up with his girl. Some sick game between them. I just cannot imagine any dude that would be upset with a woman he cares for over this. And isn't pissed at his friend from purposely jogging when he thought he would see her at a weird ass hiur, and acting fuxning predatory as hell.", "So what should a person whose hurt do to not make it predatory", "Don't ask for a picture. He would either do some make-up (it's super easy) or just hurt himself for real before taking the picture. Ask him in person (being the boyfriend, obviously not OP!). Definitely NTA", "He probably just stuck a bandage on it and snapped a picture. It\u2019s more than likely just fine.", "The same thing you would have done if there wasn't a person there that you \"knew.\" Limp home. Or to a nearby convenience store. Or anything other than demand into the home of someone who said no. He's still essentially a stranger to her and she was alone.", "I was thinking that too. Let's see the wound, buddy, that was such an eMerGEncY at your friend's GF's place at f-ing midnight.
