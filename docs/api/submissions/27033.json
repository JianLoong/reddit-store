I answered an ad online for a personal assistant that would help with filing and small errands. When the lady in question called me, she explained she had several problems, but I thought since I was just helping her with paperwork, they would not be a problem.\n\nI met her Wednesday for my first day. She is wheelchair bound. She sprayed me with hand sanitizer right away, asking me to wear sleeves on my shoes, and don't touch anything. I was really confused because how could help her with paperwork if I couldn't touch anything. Then she said that my first job was to do her laundry, help her with her hair, mop the floors, then take her to the doctor. Now I am really confused because she mentioned none of this in the phone call.\n\nLong story short, I drove her to two different doctors, the dmv, the food store, and several other places. Wasted half a tank of gas. I told her that I could only work until 6 or 7. Well, at 630, I was still waiting for her at the last doctor. I told her that I needed to go home, but she asked if my husband could make dinner for him and my son so I could continue to help her. I finally got out of there at 8pm and I was exhausted and furious.\n\nI felt used. I did everything she asked me to because i wanted to help her, but she took advantage of me. I am currently seeing a physical therapist for an injury and she asked me to reschedule all my appointments to accommodate her. I said no.\n\nTo make matters worse, she wants me to drive 10 miles under the speed, she reached over to honk the horn if a car drove beside us (which i told her not to touch the wheel of my car), and wants me to roll through stop signs instead of stopping. I have NEVER felt so uncomfortable in my life.\n\nThen today, after telling her in texts that I could no longer work for her, she begged to rethink my choice and tried to guilt me in working for her today. When I continued to tell her no, she turned aggressive and argumentative. In total, I think she sent me 10 to 12 messages and all them calling me all kinds of names. Telling me I was a lair and a cruel person. She has since changed her cragslist job post since she accused me of everything under the sun.\n\nThe reason why I feel terrible is because she told me goes to the church for food when she doesn't have money to buy food and that her money goes to doctors. Her apartment is basically empty expect for a couch, a bed, and a few other things. I wanted to help someone in need, but I feel so used and angry for allowing someone like her to get to me.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: In my text to her on how I couldn't work for her, I told her the reasons why and she continued to try to guilt me, then accused me of being a terrible person.

I'm disabled and have a set amount of government funding per year for support workers. I'm what's called \"plan managed\", so all the money, payment etc is handled by a company. They're not paid by me, they're paid by the company. I hope that makes sense? (I could be self managed, where I directly employ and pay the workers, and pay all the therapy bills etc, but holy moly that is SO much work. Even if I did it that way, it's still not \"my\" money, it's my funding, if that makes sense? Like I don't get the cash, but my support is paid for out if the amount I'm allocated.\n\nI also spend the majority of my money on doctors! I'm so grateful for funding allowing me more opportunities to not only be involved in the community, but access help and therapies that I need.", "[removed]", "My son is a caregiver for his older disabled brother.  He also gets paid through a third party entity through the state.  It was quite an ordeal to get his certification through the state as a caregiver, but he wanted to do it."]}
