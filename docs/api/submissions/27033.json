I answered an ad online for a personal assistant that would help with filing and small errands. When the lady in question called me, she explained she had several problems, but I thought since I was just helping her with paperwork, they would not be a problem.\n\nI met her Wednesday for my first day. She is wheelchair bound. She sprayed me with hand sanitizer right away, asking me to wear sleeves on my shoes, and don't touch anything. I was really confused because how could help her with paperwork if I couldn't touch anything. Then she said that my first job was to do her laundry, help her with her hair, mop the floors, then take her to the doctor. Now I am really confused because she mentioned none of this in the phone call.\n\nLong story short, I drove her to two different doctors, the dmv, the food store, and several other places. Wasted half a tank of gas. I told her that I could only work until 6 or 7. Well, at 630, I was still waiting for her at the last doctor. I told her that I needed to go home, but she asked if my husband could make dinner for him and my son so I could continue to help her. I finally got out of there at 8pm and I was exhausted and furious.\n\nI felt used. I did everything she asked me to because i wanted to help her, but she took advantage of me. I am currently seeing a physical therapist for an injury and she asked me to reschedule all my appointments to accommodate her. I said no.\n\nTo make matters worse, she wants me to drive 10 miles under the speed, she reached over to honk the horn if a car drove beside us (which i told her not to touch the wheel of my car), and wants me to roll through stop signs instead of stopping. I have NEVER felt so uncomfortable in my life.\n\nThen today, after telling her in texts that I could no longer work for her, she begged to rethink my choice and tried to guilt me in working for her today. When I continued to tell her no, she turned aggressive and argumentative. In total, I think she sent me 10 to 12 messages and all them calling me all kinds of names. Telling me I was a lair and a cruel person. She has since changed her cragslist job post since she accused me of everything under the sun.\n\nThe reason why I feel terrible is because she told me goes to the church for food when she doesn't have money to buy food and that her money goes to doctors. Her apartment is basically empty expect for a couch, a bed, and a few other things. I wanted to help someone in need, but I feel so used and angry for allowing someone like her to get to me.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: In my text to her on how I couldn't work for her, I told her the reasons why and she continued to try to guilt me, then accused me of being a terrible person.", "created_utc": 1694925962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16krphh/aita_for_telling_a_handicapped_woman_i_can_no/", "score": 1996, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She lied to you.  Now, she uses her disabilities to guilt you?  Don't fall for it.  She is a user and an overall awful person.  Remove yourself from the situation and block her.  Consider this a lesson in growing a spine.", "NTA. She sounds like a boundary stomping abusive narcissist who can't conduct herself appropriately, nor be respectful of other people whatsoever.\n\nShe baited you, didn't care about your timeline requirements and probably won't even pay you.

She needs a Personal Care Worker, not a Personal Assistant and she misled you, then completely disrespected your time and efforts.", "NTA.  You should just say, \u201cno, you completely misrepresented the job.\u201d  Repeat.  Not sure if the platform you found the job on or if it possible to report the listing as completely inaccurate and report her for fraudulent posts.", "NTA you agreed to be a personal assistant not a full time carer. It was a bait and switch.", "I'm sure she goes through a dozen of kindhearted people per month, taking advantage of each one as long as they take it. NTA.", "NTA. She needs a home health aide. Her doctor's office can help her get that into place for her and covered by her insurance. \n\nI wouldnt be doing any of this without certification and as part of an agency in case something happened (car wreck, on the job injury helping her).", "NTA There's a saying about not being obligated to light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. This job makes me think of that.", "NTA. This may be mean to say but handicapped people can be the asshole too. Just because she\u2019s disabled doesn\u2019t give her the right to lie, manipulate and hound you either. Get your money and block her number!", "Not the asshole.", "NTA, this was one of those bad job postings. You don\u2019t need to stay in a bad situation.

She set you up", "NTA. she used you and abused your kindness.", "That\u2019s really difficult and I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for stepping out of the situation you: \n\n1. Didn\u2019t sign up for and were totally mislead by\n\n2. Still attempted to help with and were met with contention and unfair expectations\n\nAnd \n\n3: tried to escape from with totally understandable reasoning and a clear establishment that this wasn\u2019t the right role for you (and again, one you DIDN\u2019T sign up for). \n\nI would totally feel the same way. As someone who has been a support worker before (a role I DID sign up for) I even still had some of these feelings. Although I never experienced anything like this, I often felt that my boundaries were pushed and times where I was going over time by a lot helping the person with things. \n\nIt\u2019s ok that you feel frustrated at this person. Anyone would in that case (surely). But perhaps to even the context, it helps to consider why this person has \u2018baited\u2019 you into the role and is acting in these seemingly irrational ways. To me these are all actions symptomatic of a system that fails disabled people everyday. It seems like they are desperate for support, albeit going about it in the wrong way.\n\nI feel for them and wish there was better for our disabled community, whilst also understanding your pain. \n\nSo the asshole here is the SYSTEM, not you (and to extent all us non disabled folk who are sometimes complacent in it, but that\u2019s another story)", "[removed]", "Block her?", "NTA", "I\u2019m a supervisor with a home care agency and you would be absolutely shocked how common this is, and how many times I\u2019ve had to talk my crying care staff down after a client got nasty with them for refusing to do tasks outside of their scope and for which they are not insured if they get hurt.", "Sometimes individuals with disabilities need to find their own help but the hours are paid by an agency. Did she mention what agency oversees her personal care? If you can identify it- they would help get your work hours paid.", "I want to kick myself now, but some of the comments are correct. I am a pushover. I saw someone who needed help and I thought that I was doing the right thing.
