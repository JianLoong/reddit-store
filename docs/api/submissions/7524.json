It's unreasonable to expect her to sit around all day, unpaid, waiting for a possible email.", "YTA\n\n> if he sends something by that morning, and we don't respond by evening, he pressures for a response. I respect that professionalism\n\nThere is **NOTHING _PROFESSIONAL_** about that kind of insecure needling.\n\n> I no longer consider my books just mine, but the family's\n\nRolling my eyes **_so_** hard. Your daughter doesn't work for you.\n\n> Keep in mind these are self-published books we're working on getting successful\n\nGood luck, tho! Amazon's got a ton of self-published dinosaur erotica, so competition is *pretty* steep!", "YTA. Your illustrator is obnoxious, and rather than deal with that, you\u2019re demanding that your daughter do nothing but wait with bated breath for the next illustration to come in so you can appease your demanding illustrator.  You\u2019re directing your demands and anger at the wrong person.", "YTA is this the same daughter who didn't want to proofread your books anymore?", "YTA. Every time you post a version of this story, everyone tells you YTA. So now YTA for demanding unpaid labor and posting about this numerous times. YTA. The answer isn\u2019t changing. YTA.", "This is the greatest most self-centered post of all-time. Is there an award for that? The whole family is working on books for free that make no money. Wow. I love it. Can I be in the family?\n\nETA YTA", "YTA for a couple reasons.\n\nFirst, you misled your daughter. You could have said \"we're waiting for a sketch back from X, and I'd rather have you here. Would you be willing to do something later this evening?\" Instead, you said it was okay and then got nasty with her after the fact. That's unprofessional and sets your daughter up for failure.\n\nSecond, you're not paying your daughter. That means that the relationship you have with your daughter is not a professional one. She is doing favors for you, and favors come with an expectation that you will be gracious and grateful. If this is a \"family business\" then pay her. It's not acceptable to say they are \"our\" books when it's work time, but not when it's revenue time. \n\nThird, you need to set professional expectations with your illustrator. Getting testy and demanding a response in less than 1 business day is not \"professionalism.\" It's just impatience. You can send your illustrator a quick \"Thanks, received, will have the approval to you by tomorrow\" email and let your daughter have one freaking lunch uninterrupted.", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter volunteers her time to help YOU with YOUR books. She is not obligated to give up her lunch plans for you.", "YTA, she's helping you essentially out of the goodness of her heart, a love for your craft, and/or feeling as though she has to. considering she doesn't get paid. \n\nand since she doesn't get paid, she doesn't have \"work hours.\" she's free to get lunch whenever she pleases. she's also a full-grown adult. \n\nall of this, and she even had the courtesy to give you a heads-up, and you STILL came down hard on her. ofc YTA.", "YTA. I get that you think it\u2019s a family thing, but it\u2019s really your thing that your family assists you with.\n\nYou don\u2019t own her time, especially since she\u2019s basically an unpaid intern. OP you should apologize to your daughter and ask her if/when/how she\u2019d like to contribute to your project.", "YTA - You want free labor from your daughter essentially. That makes you an ah. \n\nAlso if this illustrator is demanding responses that quick, thats on you to manage expectations.", "YTA. Your daughter is doing you a favour by volunteering in your little projects. You are not in a position to tell her how to spend her time.", "YTA. You expressly told her okay to getting lunch downtown. To turn it back around based on your wariness of this illustrator's \"professionalism\" isn't her issue. \n\nAnd as your edit says, you're not paying her.", "YTA you're not her employer. And why is this illustrator demanding you approve his work immediately? You're paying him. You're the client. How is his weird work issues your daughters problem? Or your problem?", "YTA. You don't pay her so her time is all hers to do whatever she wants including leaving for a whole week, never mind going for lunch. And this guy you've hired for illustration works for you, he can operate on your timeline and you need to set that expectation.", "YTA. And the dude you hired is not professional, he's obnoxiously pushy. You pay him to perform a service for you. He doesn't get to dictate the time you put in. I'd think you would want time to really look at and think about what you put in your books - stories - whatever. & Why should she waste a whole day sitting around just... Waiting. Waiting for who knows how long.", "YTA. If you aren\u2019t paying her, she doesn\u2019t have a responsibility to help. Do you make any revenue from the books? You should focus more on the fact that the illustrator has unrealistic expectations.", "YTA. She\u2019s not your employee so doesn\u2019t need to be at your beck and call.", "YTA- its NOT professional to make people feel like that have to respond in a set time. If he sent something at lunch time then you have 24 hours or by business day the next day to respond and STILL be viewed professional.\n\nYou dont tell your daughter off for wanting lunch because some artist expects you to drop everything and check for emails all day.", "Well, if you dont pay your daughter an hourly wage, then you are not entitled to her time.\n\nThe illustrator can learn to wait.\n\nYta", "YTA your insecurities are not your daughter\u2019s responsibility", "YTA.. you don\u2019t pay for daughter. Therefore she is free to do what she wants with her time, which in this case included lunch.", "YTA. You're a 60 yr old man. You're more than capable of making a decision about a chapter header & you have your wife for back up. If the two of you agree, your daughter's opinion is not needed.", "YTA. Her life doesn't center around your schedule or anyone else's. Don't like it, then find someone else to bug.", "YTA - It's you book. Your daughter deserves to live life on her terms, not around some arbitrary deadline. The artist works for you, NOT the other way around and needs to cool their jets - and I say this as someone who used to work for a game publisher.", "YTA. This is your little project. Stop forcing it on the family. She deserves her own life. Is she allowed to get a job, or are you expecting her to stay home and work with your books?", "YTA so you aren't paying her but expect her to play by employee rules, jesus come back to reality please", "YTA, and your edit seals the deal. If these books are a family undertaking, then all contributors deserve to be paid for their contributions. Anything else is exploitative by nature. The fact that she\u2019s family makes it worse, and it inherently calls into question the validity of her consent to this. For all you know, she feels like she\u2019s not allowed to back out without hurting/failing/disappointing you. But that\u2019s speculative. Whatever the circumstances surrounding the financial reality, you can\u2019t expect free labor to be supplied on your schedule. If you expect her to be at the beck and call of an eccentric artist who demands same day turnaround on any feedback, then you need to pay her. If you don\u2019t/can\u2019t/won\u2019t pay her, then you have no right to expect instant access to her time.\n\nEdited for clear wording", "**YTA** because you've been using this sub as your personal journal for months to go on and on about your weird little family self-publishing business and how you hold your grown-ass daughter hostage to it when she's trying to escape from you (and you keep changing your story about whether she's moved out or not).\n\nNo one cares. We're not your diary. Stop repeat posting about the same damn thing every few days. If you're that desperate for attention get therapy. You need it.", "YTA. You don't really talk about how your daughter feels about this whole situation.  So do you even know how she feels about writing or helping with these books?  Is it possible that she doesn't feel as deeply about this as you or your SO does?  Maybe your daughter is telling you in a way that you should have this responsibility and it's not up to her, and she is looking to find her own way in life (she just graduated college). This is just what I'm thinking. These books could mean a lot more to you than they do to her and she's just a graduate, you're her father, maybe she feels pressured more than she should be by her parents to help make these decisions.", "YTA.  I work in an industry where people commonly expect short turnaround, but anything less than half of a working day in ordinary circumstances is ridiculous.  Tell the illustrator you'll respond to future requests within five *business* hours and he can take a few deep breaths in the interim.", "YTA\nChill dude. Damn, I\u2019m a professional artist for a very well known card company and it\u2019s okay to take some time to review and offer feedback. What are deadline expectations with your illustrator? Have you set those expectations with your illustrator? So, your daughter taking time for herself is totally okay. Take a breath and calm tf down.", "YTA. Your unpaid daughter wanted to go out to lunch like a normal person; that's reasonable. What's not reasonable is pressuring and pestering your daughter because of your artist, whose time I do respect, being so needy with approval. People have lives and he can wait for your daughter to get home from lunch, or heaven forbid, 24 hours for a response.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t paying for her time so you have no right to it. Piss off bud", "YTA - Your daughter isn't being paid at all, but she's supposed to sit home \"on-call\" for you, all so you can ask \"how high?\" when someone (who you hired) says \"jump\"?   Seriously?  If you hired this dude online, presumably you're paying him, he's not paying you, and neither of you are paying your daughter.  She should go get herself lunch whenever she feels like it, unless paying employment gets in the way.", "You don\u2019t pay her. She went out to lunch to enjoy herself, which doesn\u2019t seem like an everyday thing from how you\u2019ve explained it. And you snap on her\u2026? She\u2019s a grown woman and this is a shitty way to treat someone who helps you with your passion. YTA.", "YTA.\n\n1. As you confirmed. She is not paid, she may enjoy doing it but if she is getting nothing back then who can blame her for wanting to do something for herself for a few hours.\n\n2. You gave her the ok only to snap at her for it. That sounds so manipulative.", "YTA. What\u2019s the risk/harm if she doesn\u2019t weigh in on this one decision? She\u2019s doing this to help you, and you\u2019re begrudging her a lunch out?", "YTA. She gave you a heads up, you told her the lunch was ok, you knew how long she'd be gone. Even if this was a paid job, getting mad at her for taking an approved break just because something urgent came up in the meantime wouldn't be ok, and it's even worse that it's an unpaid family favor.\n\nIf the illustrator can't even wait a few hours for feedback then that's ridiculous. I'm also confused about who's setting the deadlines here; isn't *he* the one working for *you*? You need to stand up to the person you're hiring and paying, rather than pushing your unpaid family help to sacrifice their personal lives for his schedule.\n\nAlso, does your daughter even think of this as equally \"her\" book, or is she just helping you out?\n\nDo the books make any profit, and how is it divided up?", "YTA, if he's that pushy about a response, which your daughter seems aware of, and you're that dominated by someone you hired to do work for you, then make the decision without her. She's allowed a life, especially if this isn't a paying job.", "YTA - you don\u2019t even compensate your daughter and yet you expect her to sit and be at your beck and call? That\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nAlso - did you not hire the illustrator?  Pretty sure that means that you call the shots. Your anxiety to keep up with the demands of your illustrator are not your daughters responsibility.", "YTA. You're exploiting your daughter. You don't even want her to take a break for a couple hours because you want her to focus on YOUR work without pay for hours every day. Jeez. She's entitled to a break especially since you refuse to pay her. Shame on you. Many writers take on the majority of the work themselves when they're self-publishing, but you clearly don't have the work ethic to do that. And yet you get mad at her after you've already dumped your work on her day after day?", "Ugh. You again. YTA.", "Oh my god, not this guy again. Dude, leave your daughter alone. She doesn\u2019t want to help with your shitty books. YTA", "Anyone can give the opinion. I don\u2019t see why you need a 100% vote. Let the woman LIVE. Apparently you aren\u2019t even paying her, so yes, YTA.\n\nEdited to add, your illustrator actually IS your employee; so I\u2019d be telling him he can expect in future, a response within 48 hours, period.", "YTA. I\u2019m 23f, and if I were your daughter, I\u2019d be getting very frustrated. Work is important, but having a social life is important too. I see in the comments that you don\u2019t even pay her. I hope she finds a part time job and starts making lots of new friends wherever she starts working.", "YTA Unless you are willing to pay her, the time is hers to do whatever.", "Why is some version of this reposted weekly?", "YTA I was on your side until you added that she\u2019s not being paid for her work.", "YTA.\nYou sound so ungrateful for what she does for you OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF HER HEART, and then you have the nerve to hop on Reddit and hope for validation of your awful behavior? \nI hope she realizes that she deserves better treatment and ditches you and that useless person you actually give a job title to.", "INFO Have you posted here about your daughter before, something about her wanting to move away and get a job outside of working \"the family business\"", "YTA, you post this every week. Parents' pursuits are NOT the priority in the life of a young adult. Please help her move out, then leave her **alone** for at least 6 months so she can start her own life. I replied the same thing last time. Your books are not important for her to deal with at this point in her life. Please enjoy your own pursuits without bothering her.", "Obviously YTA. Your daughter does not work for you can get lunch wherever and whenever she wants.", "YTA. Your illustrator is weirdly needy\u2014you don\u2019t need to reply on such strict deadlines.\n\n> I asked her why she is leaving in the middle of the day for hours in the first place\n\nFor lunch\u2026 read your own post, my man. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly bizarre that you expect your ENTIRE FAMILY to sit around doing nothing all day to cater to a needy illustrator for what is essentially your hobby. It\u2019s **YOUR** hobby, not a job, and certainly not your adult daughter\u2019s job.", "Oh, it's YOU again. Still the AH.", "YTA. Less than 24 hours to respond is not in fact very professional. I think you need to grow spine with this illustrator.", "YTA. So she\u2019s not getting paid for helping, and you\u2019ve pushed this to become more than just a hobby to the detriment of others like her who need to be available on demand.  So you can\u2019t even set boundaries with your illustrator to indicate that life events how come up, and that you\u2019ll get the response back within a quick but revised timeframe. \n\nShe\u2019s not going to make any friends at this rate.", "This situation has been posted before. I see your books still aren\u2019t successful and you are still using them to isolate your family Y (still) TA", "YTA and your Illustrator AH. You hired him and he's acting so unprofessional.  Why is he so demanding that his illustrations get approved in such a narrow window of time?  It sounds like you can't set boundaries with him and tell him more time is needed for approval.", "YTA - Couldn't you just give notes on your own?\n\nIt's very nice that you all do this together, that really is kind of a sweet family activity. But your daughter should be free to go out for lunch without feeling beholden to your illustrator's moods. Would it really be the end of the world if you/they waited a few hours for her thoughts? This isn't her job - it shouldn't get in the way of the rest of her life.\n\nYou say if the illustrator sends notes in the morning, he wants feedback by the evening. Fine, good for him, nice professionalism and follow-through. That being said, he sent the notes in the afternoon  (she's out for lunch, so I'm assuming here), so... why couldn't your family illustrations review wait a few hours?\n\nYOU pay the illustrator, not the other way around - why is he setting all the terms for your working relationship? If you said you'd get thoughts back to him the next morning, would he quit? You're the  client!", "YTA. You were the asshole last time you posted about free work from your daughter on your hobby.

YTA.", "Any \"family activity\", be it sports or music or writing books- should never be forced.\nParticularly unsuccessful book publishing.\n\nThis guy posted before-  basically everyone in the family has to give up all their free time and not be able to develop hobbies or interests of their own.\nGive it a rest.\n\nYour daughter should be working and finding friends and hobbies and travelling and loving, NOT being controlled in your losing venture.", "YTA. You post this every few months, and the verdict never changes.\n\n>we need everyone's thoughts to write our response back for adjustments\n\nTrust me, as a graphic designer and illustrator, we hate clients who crowdsource critiques on our work. It's exhausting and near impossible to make everyone happy. I'd hazard a guess that he wants fast feedback to get your job finished ASAP. \n\nAnd stop using your family as free labor. It's not a family business if you can't afford to pay them, it's a hobby they can't get out of participating in.", "Yta and it isn't even close.

I am beyond proud of her and proof read occasionally, but in a million years she would never expect me to be at her beck and call! Your daughter is an adult who deserves to have her own career and her own life. As a parent you should want the best for you child. I honestly cannot understand how any parent can be this selfish.\n\nAlso, I hope you have another source of income.
