You have a family who raised you your whole life and seem content with that.\n\nYour bio family chose adoption (likely to avoid fallout from the way you were conceived), they don't have a right to a do over after 18 years.", "The choice is yours, if you decide not to then no NTA.", "NTA. The choice is yours. It impacts your life.  It also affects the lives of your adoptive family but they decided to give you the contact info so you could make that choice.  \n\nIf you are happy in your life, there is no need to reach out. You may be faced with a choice again in the future if your birth mother ever finds you but you can cross that bridge then.", "NTA\n\nIt's your life, not theirs. You're not curious and that's that; I'm not getting the impression it's because you're bitter about being given up for adoption, it's just that you have your family and that's enough for you.\n\nI'm happy you had a loving family to grow up with!", "NTA.  Don't listen to anybody on this issue but yourself.  This is a very personal decision and all your friends and family need to butt the hell out.", "NTA because you've made it so far in life without any contact with them and if you don't feel compelled to contact them now why open the door to people you don't know who could make your life more difficult.", "Absolutely NTA.  Nobody has any business telling you what to do in a situation like this.  At most, a close family member might gently coax you to seek out your biological family.  But your cousin & friends hassling you about it? They\u2019re the ones acting like assholes.", "NTA. It\u2019s your bio family, your choice to reach out or not.

As someone who is also adopted, no one will blame you if you decide not to contact your bio-families side. Blood does NOT mean someone is considered family. In my case, I did actually meet my bio-family and understood almost instantly why not being raised around them or with them was a good thing.\n\nIt's up to you. Don't let anyone pressure you. If you ever get to the point where you want to contact them then that should be your choice. If not, that's also a respectable and valid choice.", "Fellow adopted young kid here, no one gets to decide about getting to know your bio family but YOU. It's 100% a personal choice and to hell with anyone trying to dictate otherwise.", "NTA\n\nI don't talk to most of my family, and I've met them all. Firstly, they're not great people, lots of bigoted views. Secondly, just because we share a bloodline, doesn't really mean shit. Character and effort are what matters. You see the effort your (adoptive) parents have put in. They're your mom and dad, and raised you as such. Makes sense you wouldn't feel obligated to want to meet your bio parents.

If you're good with that, then you're good.  Keep the information because you might change your mind at some point in the future.  As for your cousins and friends, this has nothing to do with them, and is not their choice.", "NTA it's your life Not theirs and they shouldn't be trying to force you to do it. Maybe in the future you may be open to building that bridge but since you feel this way now stand on that", "NTA It is not their choice. their opinion means nothing.", "NTA. An unfortunate situation happened with your birth mom and her being only 14 makes it even worse. She might not have wanted to give you up if she were older when it happened but it probably would have been tough regardless of age due to the circumstances regarding how she got pregnant. I'm sure your bio mom would love to hear from you as I'm sure it still hurts her to this day and she probably blames herself for the whole thing. Regardless of all that, I still think you wouldn't be an asshole to not contact them/her. It's your decision ultimately.", "NTA It's a decision you get to make, nobody else. Don't let anyone pressure you or make you feel bad for your decision. \n\nI will add it might be worth at least keeping the names and/or contact info of bio family just in case there are ever health concerns you might consider asking them about. But even if that scenario happened you don't have to build a relationship with bio fam. And you don't ever have to reach out if you don't want to.", "NTA. Adoptive kid here. I have never had much of a desire to know anything about my bio family. I wrote letters back and forth a couple of times with my bio mom but stopped soon after because i just didn't care enough (and she said some shit about my adoptive mom that pissed me off). I did the Ancestry DNA test just so that i could see my ancestry and i have not connected with any of the matches that come up. I'm just not interested. As far as I'm concerned, the people who adopted me are the most important and only family i have.\n\n You ultimately have to do what is right for you and don't let people guilt you into it.", "I was also adopted as an infant and was contacted by bio father's family at 18. I also had loving and supportive adoptive parents and did not feel like I needed or wanted to know my bio family. Long story short, I did meet bio dad several years later and I am so thankful. He and my adoptive parents got along great too. My parents are now gone, but I still have a wonerful relationship with my bio dad (as do my kids and husband) that I almost missed out on. He will never feel like a parent to me, but our relationship is still very special especially because I do not have much family left at this point. I am not saying that you should meet your bio family or even that you need to make this decision now. It is a personal choice and you may, or may not, change your mind in the future. But I will say that meeting them won't invalidate your relationship with or lessen the love between you and your parents. Love is awsome in how it can keep growing and expanding infinately. And that sometimes the best surprises are realtionships we didn't expect or think we even wanted. And if you do choose to meet them and decide they aren't your kind of people, you do not have to continue that relationship (what I figured would happen in my own case). Good luck with whatever you decide.", "NTA. Your biomom may have life long ramifications over a scenario like that. Not really fair to contact her out of the blue without her reaching out first.  The trauma she went through as a child..", "NTA at all. My best friend and cousin are both adopted and have no interest in meeting their bio families. \n\nI actually had a roommate who's situation sounds similar to yours. Her mom practically forced her to meet/build a relationship her bio mom and she said it was awkward as hell. Bio mom was (understandably) very emotional and my roommate was 16 and in her words 'angsty teen with no capacity to deal with her bio mom's very intense emotions'. \n\nDon't let anyone make you do something you don't want to do!", "NTA. You have NO obligation to contact them. None at all. You do you.", "NTA - but as many others have said it's good to get a hold of their medical history.", "As a fellow adoptee with a pretty messed up experience of my own, let me say this: blood relationships mean fuckall in my book. My biological family perished, and I'm estranged from my adoptive family. The mom of one of my closest friends in college treats me as a second son, and the sister of one of my closest friends in hs treats me as another sibling. That's the family I have nowadays, and I'm so much better off for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words, this is **your** decision and nobody else's. Do what is best for you.", "Medical information is the big thing. It's better to have it and not need it than it is to need it and not have it. Other than that, NTA, for not wanting a relationship with them.", "Was going to mention getting medical history, guess I\u2019m not alone in this thought.", "I second this. They want some kind of reunion TV movie scene. But you're the one who has to live with whatever happens. \nOP,  If your friends try to bring it up again, say--- that you are waiting for your maternal family or your biological mother to contact you first because your birth might have been incredibly traumatic for her. And that you respect the decision that they made in regards to your adoption.\n\nHell, there might be some truth to that anyway.", "Why now? Did something happen that now they're pushing you to meet them?\n\nNTA", "Nta. Start giving your opinions on things in your friends life that you shouldnt be (basically do what they are doing) Than say \u201csee how your feeling now, that\u2019s how I feel when you try and tell me it\u2019s wrong that I don\u2019t have any desire to reach out to my birth family. \u201c", "I have no contact with one of my bio parents and am nearly 50 and I do not regret my choice. They are not a good person and I am not interested in them. I did, however, end up finding three more siblings from that parent (technically half siblings). I also met a big extended family and that has been fun. I was always a black sheep with my adoptive and other bio parent's families but they are all pretty great, too. Now I have three big families and enjoy them all. I like how I naturally fit with my newly reunited family.\nYou are absolutely NTA. It is a hard choice to make and you alone get to make it and everyone else needs to respect it.", "NTA.", "NTA if you are happy as things are now why would you contact your bio family. If your bio grandparents wanted you in their life you wouldn't have been placed for adoption. Enjoy your life with your adopted family who loves you.", "NTA. Here is a bit of my experience with meeting birth family members. I was in my 30\u2019s, a letter was passed to me with a lovely message and an offer to provide medicals or meet if I would like. I decided to allow contact. 20+years later I am still sorting out my feelings about the whole thing. Even in the best scenario, its a lot. If you were not even curious yet, perhaps that is an indication to seriously consider passing on meeting/contact at this time. Many people in my life were all for the meeting of my birth family. Its easy to romanticize the idea when you are looking in from the outside. My best advice is be truly ready, do it for you because you want/need it and have tons of therapeutic support on hand. Once the genie is out, impossible to put it back. There are awesome parts and not so awesome in every big life moment and so it is with meeting birth family members, please follow your head & heart. Good luck and take care one adoptee to another."]}
