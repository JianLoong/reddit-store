Every time we visit, we try to make plans to see this place with beautiful scenery, but every time the plans don't work out. \n\nThis year we made valid plans to visit this place the day after christmas but they got canceled by a distant family member's suggestion that traffic is bad the day after Christmas. Let's call this distant family member Jessica. I understood so I suggested that we go the day after we planned. For reference, we plan to leave 2 days after Christmas so we really only have two days to visit this place. My mom was silent so I told her that I would talk to her later in private. \n\nWhen we got to talk I reiterated that we should go the day after we planned. My mom said that when I was not there she talked to Jessica and my father and they both said traffic was bad even 2 days after christmas and that we should just not go at all. I asked her how they would know traffic would be bad the day after Christmas and she avoided my question entirely. My mother said that since Jessica has lived there for years and my father has lived there in the past they would know. I was still not convinced and continued to tell her that if we left early enough we could make it to this place. She said that she had dinner with a friend that day and even though it was late in the evening she didn't want to rush. I told her that she would have 2 to 3 hours to get ready for her dinner. She said no and I probably should have left it alone but I kept talking to her until I regrettably said that she followed people blindly and would not come up with her own conclusions. To be fair she has done this before multiple times. \n\nMy mom said she was insulted by what I said and we kept going back-and-forth until I gave up and left. I went back to my room and started regretting that I talked to her on Christmas Day. I started feeling that I was a spoiled brat since I got 4 very nice presents for Christmas and I should have been thankful. Instead of going to this special place Jessica suggested my mom go to this museum with a garden next to it. To be fair, it sounded nice so I felt that maybe my mom was trying her best and I should have been grateful to go anywhere at all. \n\nTears started to well up in my eyes and that's why my mom came in. She kept repeating herself saying that I didn't know anything and what i want did not matter. I started to cry even though I was trying not to. I told my mom that she loved to sit in her anger and then my mom said she was tired and I told her that she should probably go to bed. so we can both talk about this later with clear minds. She told me \"Don't tell me what to do.\" My mom said that I was playing the victim and sarcastically said \"You're always a victim and I'm always a perpetrator\" then she left. I couldn't help but to feel that I was a spoiled brat and I should be grateful for anything at all. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1703572677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r1yne/aita_for_crying_on_christmas/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
