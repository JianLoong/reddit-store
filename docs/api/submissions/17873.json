Things were going well, until invited me to meet up in person: \n\nI showed up at the restaurant expecting a quiet dinner and a heart to heart, instead I found out that my father\u2019s fraternity had rented out the whole damn place for a twenty five year reunion. He met me at the door and told me to act like we\u2019re a happy family in front of his old friends. I, being hungry as hell at this point, made a beeline for the buffet. He promised me dinner, and by god I was going to I have it. \n\nI tried to blend into the background, until I got to chatting with some other folks my age, my father\u2019s friend\u2019s kids I assume. They started talking about their parents and I nodded and smiled along. Then I was directly asked what I got for my eighteenth birthday, and I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I defaulted tot he truth. \n\n\u201cSo, what did your parents get you for your eighteenth?\u201d\n\n\u201cUmm\u2026 I got kicked out.\u201d\n\n*cue awkward silence*\n\n\u201cOh my god, are you ok?

Apparently, what I said had gotten back to my father\u2019s friends who are now being very cold to my father. He was angry with me because \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal to just lie and save face\u201d and now he\u2019s in hot water with his university friends. \n\nI muted him and went to bed. I was sure that I was in the right here, but now I\u2019m having doubts.
