He met me at the door and told me to act like we\u2019re a happy family in front of his old friends. I, being hungry as hell at this point, made a beeline for the buffet. He promised me dinner, and by god I was going to I have it. \n\nI tried to blend into the background, until I got to chatting with some other folks my age, my father\u2019s friend\u2019s kids I assume.

Your dad was using you to look like a good dad. He couldn\u2019t even give you a heads up that the event was happening. He knows kicking you out was mean, that\u2019s why he wanted you to lie, he doesn\u2019t care if you like him or forgive him, he just wants to pretend to be a good dad so other people approve of him. I know it must hurt so bad that they reached out and it wasn\u2019t to make it up to you, it was to make them look good, but I really hope you know what kind of people they are and are able to find peace far away from them.

So now i want absolutely nothing to do with them. Welp my mammaw (dad's mom who i have nothing against shes tolerable for the most part and i do care for her as she was always kind to me and did her best to protect me back then) contacted me and told me about my step grandpa's passing and told me that nobody wanted my name on his headstone cause they were putting all his grandkids names on there but my stepmom insisted i be added. My mammaw asked me to go write something on his obituary page since i was \"family\" or whatever. Part of my wanted to be absolutely petty and say no because i knew they wanted me to do it just so their sham wouldn't be exposed. They wanted me to act as if i was still close with them and by putting something on there they could show that. I ended up doing it but not for them i did it for the rest of the family and my step grandpa because they were all nice people who never did anything to wrong me and it didnt feel right to just say no and upset them when they'd done nothing wrong to me. So i ended up writing a short message something along the lines of \"we didnt get to spend much time together in a long time but i have fond memories of the time i did spend with him and ill remember them fondly\" or something like that. I know they put my name on his headstone and wanted me to write something to save face for themselves so i worded it in a way to say i haven't been in contact with them for a very long time. It was my version of sticking it to them essentially. I will never do something like that again though. I dont regret writing something on his obituary page but i will absolutely not be doing it again just so they can \"save face\" they dont deserve to be allowed to save face like that. I was a doormat then and and did it back then to not rock the boat. If it happened now id probably give them a resounding he// no!! \n\nIf your family is wanting to use you to save face to everyone around them then you should tell them where they can shove it.
