So now i want absolutely nothing to do with them. Welp my mammaw (dad's mom who i have nothing against shes tolerable for the most part and i do care for her as she was always kind to me and did her best to protect me back then) contacted me and told me about my step grandpa's passing and told me that nobody wanted my name on his headstone cause they were putting all his grandkids names on there but my stepmom insisted i be added. My mammaw asked me to go write something on his obituary page since i was \"family\" or whatever. Part of my wanted to be absolutely petty and say no because i knew they wanted me to do it just so their sham wouldn't be exposed. They wanted me to act as if i was still close with them and by putting something on there they could show that. I ended up doing it but not for them i did it for the rest of the family and my step grandpa because they were all nice people who never did anything to wrong me and it didnt feel right to just say no and upset them when they'd done nothing wrong to me. So i ended up writing a short message something along the lines of \"we didnt get to spend much time together in a long time but i have fond memories of the time i did spend with him and ill remember them fondly\" or something like that. I know they put my name on his headstone and wanted me to write something to save face for themselves so i worded it in a way to say i haven't been in contact with them for a very long time. It was my version of sticking it to them essentially. I will never do something like that again though. I dont regret writing something on his obituary page but i will absolutely not be doing it again just so they can \"save face\" they dont deserve to be allowed to save face like that. I was a doormat then and and did it back then to not rock the boat.

Your parents aren't just assholes, they are  \n\ud83d\udd25*flaming*\ud83d\udd25 assholes. \n\nIt makes me sick to think you were treated this way. Sometimes bad parents happen to good people.", "They only contacted you for reunion", "NTA\n\nOh I wonder if your dad has been using you as an excuse for years? Sorry I have to take a day off, my son is graduating. Sorry I can\u2019t make that work related thing, I promised I\u2019d take my son fishing that weekend.", "NTA, but your parents are.", "You said you're over it but I don't think you are. You shouldn't care about them at all. You didn't do anything wrong. Your dad deserves to be shunned. Why on earth did he bring you? It sounds like they wanted their kids there but he should have made up an excuse. Why would you lie? He didn't earn your loyalty.", "NTA. Your parents kicked you out and ONLY invited you back into their lives to play happy families for your sperm donors reunion with his uni buddies. Sounds like he's been lying to them forever about what kind of person your parents are.\n\nKeep his ranting texts and if they try to cover their asses by slandering YOU to paint them as martyrs for raising you, show the texts. They threw you away at the first legal opportunity. Let them rot in the mess they created themselves.", "Your dad probably lost face because he lied and was found out, not because he was a shitty parent; If he had not tried to put forth the \"happy family\" facade, he would not have lost face. \n\nNTA for being truthful.", "Truth sets everything free. Hehe (\u2060\u25e0\u2060\u203f\u2060\u25d5\u2060)\n\nNTA", "NTA. No one can make me change my mind. NO ONE CAN.", "This was a masterful revenge without it actually even being revenge. All OP did was make conversation at a party they didn't even know they were attending.\n\nOP is NTA", "I would go one of two ways on that.\n\n\"Wait, so you *didnt* kick me out?!? Wow, talk about getting our wires crossed! /s\"\n\nOr\n\n\"I dont lie about things its way too much effort and I'm laaaaazzzyyyyyy\"", "Kind of sounds like you\u2019re coming down on OP for the approval thing. That\u2019s a very normal and valid thing for people. It has only been 2 years since it happened. OP was hesitant and doubtful, but went ahead and gave them the benefit of the doubt like a lot of people would. Of course they were hopeful and wanting their parents to embrace them possibly.", "Frankly I would have been voting NTA if OP had made a point of announcing this at the top of her voice unprompted.", ">The fact that he told, not asked but told you to play happy family for his friends, is telling that they\u2019re not sorry at all.\n\nIt's also telling that *he knows it was wrong*. \n\nIf he genuinely thought it was a justifiable method of character-building/parenting, he would have no problem telling his buddies that \"we encouraged her to stand on her own two feet at an early age, and she's been successful beyond our expectations - we're very proud of her\" or something. \n\nBut no. He knows it was shitty and isn't sorry at all for its effects on OP. He's just sorry that his pettiness and cruelty was found out by people he respects, and that the result is that they no longer respect him.", "The father shouldn't have anything to be embarrassed of... Right? Right?? This clearly shows that he knows what he did [kicking out his 18 year-old son] was wrong. I say he (the father) should suck it up lol and don't try to hide the fact that he kicked his son out.", "Why? This was calculated by OP\u2019s sperm donor to make the legacy of his name look good. Completely self serving for the  \u201cfather\u201d. Go NC and consider a name change.", "The frat bros have probably never seen OP before, as his post indicates he mostly raised himself.   Bros probably put Dad on the spot to finally show OP in person. \n\nWhat the hell sort of lies was OP supposed to be able to make up on the fly, after being TRICKED into a party when he was only expecting dinner? \n\n*\"Yeah, Dad bought me a Maserati.\"*  would quickly have been followed by requests to see the pictures of same on OP's phone. The jig would be up immediately.\n\nSounds like Dad was on the spot to bring OP, lured him there with lies, and blew his cool when OP told the truth.  \n\nHe f'ed around, found out, and instead of taking responsibility for YEARS of his own shtty behaviour, tries to blame OP.\n\nNTA, OP.   COMPLETELY NTA.", "Your comment has been removed because it does not address the OP in good faith.\r\n\r\nIf you suspect a post breaks one of our rules, please report it instead of commenting. **Do not feed trolls**\r\n\r\nContinuing to post comments like this will lead to a ban.\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "  But it also shows he/they had no intention of making up with you, he just wanted you on hand to make him look good.", "kick HIM out.", "OP is male.  And, yes, I'm sure he tried that line.  But I'm equally sure none of them believed him.", "Well no the part of them being cold to OP is probably true or his father wouldn\u2019t be blowing up his phone. And even if they did tell a story about OP being wild, it wasn\u2019t enough and no biggie but fyi OP is a male.", "This.\n\nOP, that is your response to your father if he blows up your phone anymore:\n\n\"Dude! Did you or did you not kick me out when I turned 18? If that is embarassing to you you should have thought about behaving with integrity and the love of a parent. I'm not going to lie for you because I Do have integrity.\"\n\nThen , end the discussion. No good is going to come from this. They treated you very poorly indeed.", "_\"Good evening everybody! Is this mic on? Ah yes. Thank you for the wonderful evening so far. I've had a great time hearing stories about the childhood of all your sons and daughters. And that has brought me to share my own story on stage here....\"_", "But ofc he lied about his son age as well (making it 2 years younger) because else his relations could have done the math and concluded that they had been very young when they became parents.", "Imagine being 20! years old and still being referred to as a kid. You're older than the universe for crying out loud.", "Definitely NTA. You told the truth. If your father's upset, then he deserves to be \"embarassed.\"", "My husband has given up with his brother. At some point you realise the gain is not worth the repeated pain.", "I don't think anyone lied about his age. Someone just asked what he got on his 18th birthday (not if he's still 18).", "\u201cWell well well, if it isn\u2019t the consequences of my own  actions\u201d \u2014OP\u2019s Dad.", "/u/Jazzlike-Eg is a comment stealing bot.
