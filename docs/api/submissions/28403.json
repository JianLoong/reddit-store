{"id": 28403, "submission_id": "1720u8a", "title": "AITA for ignoring my sisters after they weren't there in my time of need?", "selftext": "I (29F) won't say the diagnosis, but it causes me to be ill very often; it's a miracle if there's one week where I'm not sick. This diagnosis means I'm prone to getting ill and will often easily pick up whatever my work colleagues or anyone who is sick and is around me has. My immune system is weak, and whereas people are often told to rest and take paracetamol/ibuprofen, I have to go to my GP for solid antibiotics to fight this infection as my immune system can't. Although I have this diagnosis, I don't talk about it or complain and get on with the day.\r  \nAnyway, this is a recent issue. About three weeks ago, I became ill. This was the worst type of illness I experienced, and my doctor booked me in for a next-day appointment and diagnosed me with what she thought was the diagnosis and what she thought was the correct treatment. I came home and took the treatment but didn't feel better after a few days, so I called my doctor, who upped the dosage. Usually, although I'm ill, I'm alright on my own, but I just was so poorly I couldn't get out of bed for this illness. I asked my oldest sister if she could just come down and look after me for a few hours, and she said she couldn't, which I respected as she does have a one-year-old son now. I asked my middle sister, who's currently unemployed, and she just said no, and I'm not going to lie; I was pissed with her. \r  \nA few days later, I felt worse and decided to call the ambulance, and the paramedics said I developed sepsis. This was the scariest moment of my life as my mum passed away due to sepsis two years ago. I was so scared I couldn't stop crying, and the paramedic comforted me. We went to A&E, and they phoned my NOK, and my oldest sister, who is NOK, said she couldn't come down. My best friend, however, drove straight down from work to be with me. \r  \nSince then, I've fully recovered from sepsis but haven't recovered mentally, if I'm honest, and the thing is, what I find difficult is whenever my sisters are ill or need money, it's always me coming down to look after them even though I have a weak immune system. I always lend them money as I don't have financial circumstances. The only person here for me in my time of need is my best friend. I'm pissed and upset with my sisters for not being there, and I felt they would know what I would think due to what happened with mum. \r  \nI haven't spoken to my sisters since then, yet they still try to call me and text me but say I'm being an asshole for being upset and ignoring them just because they weren't at the hospital. Certain family members have said I'm being childish and pathetic, and it's about time I grew up. I feel a bit guilty for not messaging my sisters, and I wonder if I'm the asshole for being upset with them and taking it too far?", "created_utc": 1696665791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1720u8a/aita_for_ignoring_my_sisters_after_they_werent/", "score": 601, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So why shouldn\u2019t you be angry with them?! The ones that need to grow up are them. Unless it\u2019s literally life or death - no more help financially or otherwise for them. They\u2019ve shown their true colors with this. And that\u2019s what you need to tell the others when they fall for their story.", "Your life was in danger and your sisters didn't seem to give a flying fig. You have every right to be absolutely furious with them. NTA.  \nI'd suggest updating your emergency contacts and POA and suchlike to the person who has proven they will be there for you.", "Nta It's those hard times that show you who you family is. Obviously, you're lucky to have a family member in your best friend. Cherish her and don't give so much to those who don't give back. It's just a saner approach to family.", "NTA, they've clearly been using you for money and favors. That needs to stop now. Stop helping them. They made their choice, and should feel the consequences.", "NTA! They ignored you in your time of need when you got sick with something that actually killed your mother! You have the right to ignore them, and like someone else said, change nok to your best friend who was there for you when it should have been your family", "Nta- sweet love please consider NC.\nBig hugs!", "NTA inform your sisters that they have shown they obviously have better things to do then care about your health and you have better things to do as well. To the family saying grow up ask them to as well and to mind their business or be cut off. I would take a step back and treat them the same way they treated you. They can complain and remind them of how they treated you and to not expect anything different. Match their energy.", "NTA but to be honest sometimes someone who is sick all the time wears down the people around them. I know because I had a double lung transplant and needed caregivers 24/7 for a few months after. I also have no immune system due to the anti-rejection drugs. Cut your family some slack as I am pretty sure they care. I am willing to bet a lot of your conversations involve stating how poorly you feel in one way or another. Your family has \"your disease fatigue\" for the moment.  It does not mean they don't love you. Your friend was a good friend to you.", "Quit helping them\u2026 they weren\u2019t there for you so why keep bailing them out?\u2026 they were probably already thinking about how they are going to be splitting and spending your money while you were in the hospital. No - you are NOT The ASS! But your family is for acting like they are!!!", "What so bad being childish and pathetic? You feel one way relationship, so to respond to that is being childish, because it's one way relationship anyway.", "NTA. Your sisters dgaf about you. You help them, they don't bother. It's a one way street. Which us unsustainable and why I'm not in contact with my sibs", "NTA.  Now you know a lot about how your siblings feel about you. They think you're an ATM.  Say no to every request about money from now on.  Don't be there when they're ill.  In their world, this is acceptable behavior.  Maybe it was difficult logistically for the sister with a toddler, but your other sister just wasn't interested.  I'd go low contact with your sisters and certain family members.  Communicate when you feel like it, ignore them when you're just not up to dealing wit them.", "NTA\n\nUpgrade BF to sister. Downgrade former sisters to strangers.", "NTA.", "Based on what is shared in OP's post, NTA.  \n\nI would love to know the sisters' stories.  It's a little suss to me that the illness in question isn't shared.  And for sisters to not show up if a hospital calls them and says your sister is here for sepsis, there is definitely another side to this story.  \n\nUnless they really hate OP and want her to die.  If that's truly the case, then - most definitely - go no contact with them.  And take them out of any will you may have.\n\nOP, do not burn your best friend out by calling on her all the time.  You need some real supports. Paid ones, because even people who care about you have lives & other responsibilities. You might want to look into something called adult case management in the U.S..  If you aren't in the U.S., call whatever passes for Health & Human Services (or ask your doctor) what is available to you for support.  People with serious health conditions or disabilities can get assistance finding state programs to assist them with home health (can be nursing, companionship, or even light housework) and transportation to medical appointments or the pharmacy.\n\nIf you are this vulnerable to serious illness needing frequent nursing care, you should try to find an assisted living arrangement.  An adult case manager can help with that, too.", "OP needs to start saving their time, energy and money for themselves since the siblings can't be relied on at all. If they have a problem with it, than OP can remind them that they are never their for OP. \n\nNTA, and OP, you need to drop the rope. It'll be much healthier for OP in the long run.", "There is the concept of the social bank account. Basically when you do something nice and helpful it grows and if you rely on favours it diminishes.\n\nOP sisters have heavily overdrawn their account and trying to go further into debt. It's time they do stuff for OP.", "This is the correct response! \n\nOP my immune system is weakened from MS. So every cold I get is at least 2 weeks! I\u2019m prone to bronchitis and now go straight to the dr for antibiotics as soon as I cough up something yellow. I have started asking people if they have AC & if anyone in the house is sick before I visit! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The flu shot helps me so much as did the medication for COVID the one time I had it. About sepsis my stepdad is diabetic, has had sepsis twice\u2026\u2026 the last time he lost all his toes and 1/3 of his foot! So if you even think you might have sepsis you need to rush to the ER that moment! \n\nI wish you the best!", "And  OP needs to have a talk with her bestie about having her POA and NOK", "Agreed", "This is the way.", "what they said", "One of the best days of my life was the day I went NC with my sister.  So damn freeing. \n\nHappy Cake Day!! \ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf82", "Yes, I was about to mention changing the NOK designation. There\u2019s a reason I\u2019m my best friend\u2019s official next of kin. It\u2019s because if someone calls me to let me know there\u2019s an issue, I fucking turn up, unlike his family. Sounds like OP needs to change hers over.", "That's what gets me. Every one of those family members would be terrified and hope for some sort of support network or someone to be there at all for them. Yet call OP childish for wanting one of her sisters there.\n\nThe sis with the 1 year old I can kind of get. But you'd think at the word that their sister was in the hospital for sepsis that they would have husband or a friend take the kid for an hour or two and go to see their sister.", "If they haven\u2019t already they really should apologize to you and also you have an amazing best friend who really cares for you", "I wonder if we have heard the full version too. But based on the post, it\u2019s NTA\n\nOP stop giving people money, keep it for yourself incase you need to pay for a carer", "As soon as op stated not sharing illness, I knew something was off.", "People trying to apologize don\u2019t sic other family members on someone and tell them to grow up. They don\u2019t want to apologize, they just want things to go back to normal, for them, where OP gives and they take.", "YES!!!", "Just so you know, that quote has no historic basis. It\u2019s a modern thing that popped up online a few years back as the \u2018true quote\u2019 but there is not a single historic source actually backing that. It\u2019s about as historic as \u2018live, laugh, love\u2019.", "This pulled at my heartstrings and made me realise I have not one person in my life who would do this for me. What a wake up call.", "The hospital is calling to tell you about your sister. I don't think there is any explanation left to feel the gravity of the situation, because the hospital would have told what is going on.", "I am so sorry.   NTA", "She developed SEPSIS, the hospital called the sister, that is a reason to drop everything especially when it is what killed their mother too.  \nAlso, she never calls her sisters for help when she is sick, this was a one-time thing. If my sibling called to ask for help for something they generally don't, I'll go running to them.", "I'd ask if the friend would be okay to be written down as NOK. They don't sound reliable at all.", "NTA for OP, whats the point of relatives if not one can respond in the time of need especially since OP helps them sometimes. AT least a equivalent transactional return would be nice. This is like strangers. OP should however ensure that she has a support structure in place for these kind of emergencies since they are more likely to occur due to low immunity.", "It's also crazy how much eliminating little stressors like that can help improve the body's ability to deal with autoimmune shit", "I read something somewhere on reddit~ The fuck bank is empty. You are overdrawn. We are all out of fucks to give. More fucks must be deposited to get your fuck account positive.", "I have polymyalgia rheumatica, so immune system problems hit home.", "Definitely", "Honestly, chronic illness can wear on people. If OP is a sick as often as they describe, that might cause bestie to back off is she\u2019s given more responsibility than she currently has. \n\nI imagine the mom of a one-year-old has a really hard time juggling their child\u2019s needs with their chronically ill sibling\u2019s needs. And being unemployed doesn\u2019t mean someone is available at beck and call. \n\nThe relatives saying OP needs to grow up lends me to think that maybe OP needs a therapist instead of seeking attention from her siblings. Sure, sepsis is deadly, but it\u2019s Peter and Wolf\u2026someone who calls often for help will not get the same response as someone who only calls when things are really bad.\n\nEdited for clarity", "1652 is modern times? Wow. TIL.", "Who cares, it's appropriate. Nobody's talking about history here.", "Did I mention historic?\n\nChecks post. \n\nNope I didn\u2019t.", "NOK stands for next of kin, friend should have Healthcare directive", "Well how about simple reciprocity then? She is there for them when they are sick, and gives them money without complaint. They should at least do the same. Or OP should wash her hands of them and build a new support system"]}
