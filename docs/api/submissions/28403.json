{"id": 28403, "submission_id": "1720u8a", "title": "AITA for ignoring my sisters after they weren't there in my time of need?", "selftext": "I (29F) won't say the diagnosis, but it causes me to be ill very often; it's a miracle if there's one week where I'm not sick. This diagnosis means I'm prone to getting ill and will often easily pick up whatever my work colleagues or anyone who is sick and is around me has. My immune system is weak, and whereas people are often told to rest and take paracetamol/ibuprofen, I have to go to my GP for solid antibiotics to fight this infection as my immune system can't. Although I have this diagnosis, I don't talk about it or complain and get on with the day.\r  \nAnyway, this is a recent issue. About three weeks ago, I became ill. This was the worst type of illness I experienced, and my doctor booked me in for a next-day appointment and diagnosed me with what she thought was the diagnosis and what she thought was the correct treatment. I came home and took the treatment but didn't feel better after a few days, so I called my doctor, who upped the dosage. Usually, although I'm ill, I'm alright on my own, but I just was so poorly I couldn't get out of bed for this illness. I asked my oldest sister if she could just come down and look after me for a few hours, and she said she couldn't, which I respected as she does have a one-year-old son now. I asked my middle sister, who's currently unemployed, and she just said no, and I'm not going to lie; I was pissed with her. \r  \nA few days later, I felt worse and decided to call the ambulance, and the paramedics said I developed sepsis. This was the scariest moment of my life as my mum passed away due to sepsis two years ago. I was so scared I couldn't stop crying, and the paramedic comforted me. We went to A&E, and they phoned my NOK, and my oldest sister, who is NOK, said she couldn't come down. My best friend, however, drove straight down from work to be with me. \r  \nSince then, I've fully recovered from sepsis but haven't recovered mentally, if I'm honest, and the thing is, what I find difficult is whenever my sisters are ill or need money, it's always me coming down to look after them even though I have a weak immune system. I always lend them money as I don't have financial circumstances. The only person here for me in my time of need is my best friend. I'm pissed and upset with my sisters for not being there, and I felt they would know what I would think due to what happened with mum. \r  \nI haven't spoken to my sisters since then, yet they still try to call me and text me but say I'm being an asshole for being upset and ignoring them just because they weren't at the hospital. Certain family members have said I'm being childish and pathetic, and it's about time I grew up. I feel a bit guilty for not messaging my sisters, and I wonder if I'm the asshole for being upset with them and taking it too far?", "created_utc": 1696665791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1720u8a/aita_for_ignoring_my_sisters_after_they_werent/", "score": 2364, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do you need someone to take care of you when you are sick?  Even for a few hours?   Your sisters are not your mother.  What are they going to do that you can't do for yourself?\n\nLastly, you are pretty damned judgemental on your sisters, aren't you?

They have their own lives and plans, and you know nothing about what these are. \n\nSo let me paint a picture- you are always sick.  You ask them, quite frequently, to take care of you.  This requires them to drop what they are doing, cancel plans, and come to you to baby you.  Rinse.  Repeat.  Over and over.

People have different traumas and different boundaries.

How you got it. \n\nWhile not uncommon or impossible, I find it odd that there was no boyfriend there. And no one other than your best friend there. It's either one of two things. Either you got it from a boyfriend who had it and your family warned you at some point about this situation, or more likely, you were a drug addict (most likely heroin) and they understandably are not concerned with your well-being. Not that it makes it right what they did, but being apathetic to you isn't shocking to me. There must be a reason they've been this apathetic, especially considering the way your mother died two years. Another option that comes to mind is \"the boy who cried wolf\". You've possibly turned into a hypochondriac due to your condition and they're sick of enabling you. \n\nAgain, this is a presumption, and I'm not gonna say anything either way as it is all speculation based off of not thinking of an alternative as to why you're adamant about not discussing your diagnosis.

I literally said I'm not saying anything either way because we don't know if there's a backstory. I simply suspect that there is. I've had people with mental health problems and drug addiction in my life. I've also had sick people too so I understand her side of the story. So, if there is a backstory, she needs to be honest about it before going on here before garnering sympathy from unwitting redditors", "I wouldn't be able to trust sisters in this situation. OP mentioned something about sisters needing financial help, we don't know what the economic difference is between OP and her sister and we don't know if sisters might make certain decisions because it would result in them getting a windfall.\n\nI mean it's not very likely, but it's happened!
