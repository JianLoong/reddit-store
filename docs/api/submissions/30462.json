He was trying to bond with one of the few people he can have conversations with, and you tried to set what is overall a healthy boundary at work. Although I'm not sure what his background has to do with anything.", "NAH, you aren't obligated to share anything you dont want to but you could have been a little less blunt. You made your comment personal by adding \"with you\" at the end of it. \n\nAs a reformed ex convict  who is socially awkward he may have taken that to mean that you have a problem with him, which is seems like you do when you say \"especially with him, I find it eerie.\" and its fine if you are not comfortable with him but if you want to remain friendly with him then you may want to apologize and explain that you dont like talking about your private live in general at work and that it wasn't meant personally.", "Do you get freaked out when other people ask about your family?\n\nChances are James didn't have a normal family life.  He's interested in how yours works. \n\nTry to pretend he's a person and don't assume he's a predator.", "NAH. Do you know what James was in prison for? If it was something having to do with harming another person, I understand why you're wary.\n\nYou are obviously not obligated to tell anyone anything about your personal life, regardless of the situation. James was imprisoned when he was young, though, and it has likely affected his ability to communicate and form friendships/relationships with others. \n\nAs long as he is not a dangerous individual, and from the description you gave he does not seem to be, then I think it's safe to assume he was only trying to deepen your connection beyond small talk in order to form a true friendship. \n\nYou have set your personal boundaries, which is never something to feel bad about. Maybe try breaking the tension with him by striking up a conversation about something else next time you see him.", "NAH. If you want to alleviate his anxiety, you can let him know that it's not a personal thing about him specifically and that you don't like discussing those subjects at work/with coworkers. Even if that isn't quite true, it may help him both feel better and also understand that those probing questions may not be appropriate for the workplace.", "NTA. James has difficulty figuring out what you can and cannot discuss when you are shooting the breeze with a colleague. You did him a favour by telling him he had overstepped. Next step is letting him know that you are not mad at him, and that you can discuss other things. Like the weather, football, fashion, or whatever you guys would like to talk about. It is not the end of the world that he overstepped, and that you took so long to stop it. You have probably both learned from the experience.", "NAH I feel for him and I feel for you as well because it can be awkward. \n\nI hate how previous comments insinuate things like *\"why mention the ex-con thing as if it were important?\"* and that you *\"have a problem with him\"*\n\nYou don't have a problem with him ***however***, you are a young woman who is trying to be kind and inclusive without putting yourself at risk and people need to understand that. Your coworker might not see it and men tend to say we're paranoid...but when something happens to a young woman people are quick to jump to *\"how did she not know better?\"* \n\nFunny enough, I'm in a similar situation with a coworker (not an ex con) but he asks me off the wall questions about my family and travel habits (???) and he found out that I'm going to rent a bedroom in a new place and he's going to be my neighbor. He's gone on and one about helping me move furniture into my room even though I've told him multiple times that I don't need furniture, and he's \"curious about my set up\" (!!!!) and that if I need anything, he can give me a ride (fuck that) and that he wants to come over for a house warming (I'm just...renting a room) and this dude is weird. And nosy AF. He's white, in his late forties and has all the red flags. He knows what car I drive and I've mentioned it to my coworkers and it's freaking hard. \n\nIs he nosy? Is he socially awkward? Is he unstable? Is he dangerous? Why is he leaving work later? Why does he keep \"bumping into me\" on my breaks? Why why why..?\n\nAs a young woman (I'm 25F) it's ***freaking tough***. I can understand where you're coming from and I would honestly just let this pass with your coworker. When he asks you questions that you aren't comfortable with, you can set down a healthy boundary and not answer him. You could also deflect by asking him questions (ex: did you do anything fun this weekend?) or occasionally deflect him if you can (ex. Hold that thought! So and so is calling me, can I catch up later?) and you can even tell him you didn't mean to hurt his feelings, but people have boundaries. He'll get the hang of casual conversation in due time.", "NAH, but you could have handled it better, you could have kept it vague and said you don't discuss your family much at work, not making specifically about him.\n\nGoing out on a limb, maybe he comes from a dysfunctional one and was trying to live family life vicariously through you? You are by no means obligated to go along, just let him down in a more gracious way?", "NTA - and don't feel bad.  You've set up a perfectly acceptable boundary.  Like you said, I am not surprised that he has some confusion with social cues but that's totally understandable.  I honestly don't think that this will be too much of a big deal.  You never said that you were going to stop talking and socializing with him, just that you aren't going to do it with your family as the subject.  As long as he sees that you're still friendly and supportive, you and he will get a long fine.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Be nice to him but no one needs to know any personal details you don\u2019t want to share.", "NTA - you sound like you\u2019re polite and exercising boundaries is a part of that. Hopefully both him and yourselves give him a chance to be comfortable again. It\u2019s alright, he needs to have that happen as he\u2019s getting back into the world", "NAH But please go say Hi to James, ask him how hes doing or make small talk with him when you see him next time at lunch or a break.  I don't know what he did to get into prison and that could make a huge difference but it seems like your kindness towards him has meant a lot.", "NAH he doesn\u2019t know what else to make small talk about", "> I don't like sharing private matters like that at work, especially with him, I find it eerie.\n\nWhy?\n\nNAH, but like... why? It sounds like he's just trying to be polite. You're under no obligation to tell your coworkers anything, but the ex-con info feels very strange to mention.", "This. It\u2019s normal to ask coworkers about their family, especially if they bring it up first. But you don\u2019t have to tell him anything and it\u2019s fine to ask him to stop.", "This. I don't think he's an A H or are you; however why even mention the Ex-Con thing?", "He\u2019s been in prison since she was 14 it\u2019s completely reasonable to be alert to a risk he may pose. 12 years in prison is not a small time thing. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s common thing all people go through. \n\nIf a dozen years of prison can\u2019t be a red flag on its own then what can be?\n\nIt sounds like he was just being polite honestly, but it\u2019s not ridiculous to be suspicious", "I think it\u2019s relevant for two reasons:\n\n1. Social anxiety at work. He was stuck in jail from ages 20-32, so there\u2019s a very high chance he\u2019s never worked in an office before & might be a bit nervous about etiquette/social expectations. He\u2019s missed out on life events, how culture & media have evolved (isolated since 2011 would be a huge shock), and for him specifically, the more \u201cforgivable\u201d blunder years of your 20s - people kinda expect you to have it together by 32. All in all, I feel like it was a key explainer of his polite nervousness. \n\n2. He\u2019s been ostracized by his other coworkers - she said most of them won\u2019t talk to him due to his past :( Which explains why he seems a bit clingy/needy to her since she\u2019s one of the few people there to be friendly to him. \n\nAgreed that it\u2019s NAH! I can\u2019t imagine how jarring and nerve wracking it must be to be in his position, but from experience I know it can be tiring to be someone\u2019s sole friend, even when it\u2019s limited to a work setting.", "When you're a single young woman, shit like this is scary because some conversations can seem friendly but end up having a sinister intent behind it. I have a coworker whose not an ex con and he asks some out there questions like my family and he even knew when I was going to move. He knows what car I drive and I observe his work habits as well. As of three weeks ago, he leaves later the later I stay. Sometimes, your gut just knows. \n\nThe only difference is the ex con could take a hint and excused himself. My coworker doesn't and he's like....super interested in knowing about where I live and what my travel habits are and I've told him to fuck off and he just doesn't. \n\nIf you've been in the situation, you can become a little paranoid and it's tough. When you're a younger female, family tends to drill the worst possible scenarios into your mind. And if you watch crime shows, forget it! You become super aware of everything! \n\nPeople need to be aware of who you're asking this questions. Asking a 24 year old single female is different than asking a 55 year old married man. They're things you learn from exposure.", "There is a huge difference between your situation and this one. In your case it sounds like you have a stalker who is asking questions about how he can track you better.\n\nIn OP's case it is someone who is asking how her family is doing and what they do at a family meeting. Thats just someone who is trying to be a friend.", "100% this.", "True! I do have a stalker and I've taken the proper steps to minimize and mitigate the issue (as lame and troublesome as that is) and yes, her coworker does legitimately sound like someone who came off as awkward, but I can understand where they're both coming from.\n\nWhen you've been stalked before, you either read too much into friendly interactions (like possibly OP's case) or being able to catch on to subtleties.\n\nIs OP reading too much into her coworkers intentions? Honestly, none of us will know except her. There's a difference between listening to your gut and letting fear augment and disproportion a situation. It's up to OP to figure out which one it is, and she might require the help of a third party to help dissect the interactions step by step if her judgement is clouded.", "Your friend is wrong. How can a nice, polite, cordial guy with a LOT of social anxiety learn how to.behave, if no one tells him when he overstepped? You did fine. Hopefully, he comes back again next time with a better sense of your boundaries and what is appropriate to broach. \n\nNAH.", "NAH \n\n\nBut maybe think about topics you'd be willing to talk about with him. Family is an easy thing to talk about when trying to make small talk. If you want to be friendly/talk to him, try to figure out how to steer the conversation. TV shows? Weekend plans? Hobbies? Sports?", "He was honestly just trying to be a friend to you", "YTA honestly. The way you worded your response just shows that you also judge him from his past instead of it actually being a rule against discussing family at work. Which fair, you can do that if you wish, but it sounds like he was just being friendly and you burned him for it. On the bright side, he probably won\u2019t bother you anymore", "NAH\n\nProbably a big assumption on my part, but if he had a dysfunctional family, hearing about what a seemingly functional (to him) family does is intriguing to him.", "NTA. Go with your gut.", "\"James, I'm not comfortable talking about my family at work.  Mentioning my family meeting was a one-off.  I've tried hinting that it makes me uncomfortable, but realized that I needed to be more direct.  Unfortunately that directness came across harsher than I intended, as I neglected to add that I'm not comfortable discussing my private life with anyone at work.  I'm happy to continue chatting with you, but only if you respect this boundary.\"\n\nNTA.  I might agree with those who say N A H if you were a man his age or older, but you are a younger woman who may or my not know why he was in prison.  Best to err on the side of caution.", "You sound like a nice, decent, considerate person. Don\u2019t get played by an ex con. They are master manipulators. \n\nYou didn\u2019t say why he was in prison, but twelve years is a while. It was probably something violent. I don\u2019t know why he was in prison, but he wasn\u2019t sent there for singing too loud in church.  \n\nKeep your guard up around this guy. Be polite, but distant. Say good morning and keep on walking.", "It sounds like James thought he had made friends with you when you didn't see him as a friend, which is kind of obvious in your question when you refer to him as \"my ex-con coworker.\" You made it clear to him that you don't want to share information about your family, which is your prerogative. NTA.", "NTA. In general, it\u2019s good to keep your private life out of the workplace. But do you know why he was in prison? Did he steal a car, murder someone or commit sexual assault? That might have a bearing on why people haven\u2019t been welcoming.", "NTA but as others have said, he was probably just looking for topics to talk about in trying to learn how to be social. Maybe you can reach out to him and bring up sports or something on tv and be ready to talk about safe things.", "NTA but i certainly would have worded it differently. How you said it likely came off as \"I don't want to discuss my family with \\*you\\*\" rather then \"i don't really want to discuss my family in general\"", "NAH - You are under no obligation to discuss your personal life with people you don't want to, whether it's a work colleague who is an ex-convict, or whatever. It's important to set boundaries.\n\nIt seems like a lot of people here are making assumptions about the guy's intentions. We don't know what his intentions are, we can't know, and that is beside the point.", "Nah. But I would\u2019ve said at work instead of \u201cyou\u201d. \n\nHe\u2019s already socially awkward, he knows how people see him and using the word \u201cyou\u201d probably set him back from finally feeling comfortable and semi-accepted by someone. So I think that was a little rude and you could\u2019ve chosen better wording.", "NAH. The guy was just trying to find a topic he could use to socialise with, and you're drawing a reasonable boundary. \n\nIf you're concerned about him being anxious about it, a quick follow up with him to say you're not angry or anything, you'd just prefer not to talk about your private life, but are happy to discuss other things.", "That and he might be estranged from his own family. He could be for any reason, but I know someone who went away for several years and had a hard time reconnecting with his family after getting out. So maybe there was some vicarious living at play as well.", "That is all beside the point. No one is obligated to talk to a colleague about their personal life. She did nothing wrong by setting boundaries.", "That, maybe why Op became somewhat candid. Throwing no shame or aspersions. To be fair there are crimes, and then there are \"CRIMES\"."]}
