Maybe you can hire a babysitter or two and shove all the kids together in a nearby location but not in the actual venue. Maybe someone can bring them over for the duration of one song of the reception and take them back out again. If people are traveling to get to you maybe you can arrange a hotel babysitting service or something. \n\nThe mistake people make in these situations is usually not being clear enough about how committed they are.

Everything at the wedding was extra luxurious. Most luxurious wedding I have ever attended. The brides dress looked a lot like Grace Kelly's wedding dress.

I'm from the UK - so it was legal to have alcohol with a meal under 18.\n\nOP's 21 rule seems bonkers, especially as apparently OP is in the UK so the drinking age is officially 18. Keep young kids out - yes, sure. But OP is excluding legal adults.", "Huh, I guess my eyes skipped over the spelling and focused on the 21.\n\nI saw another comment where OP mentioned the venue is 21+, so that's where the age comes from. I don't remember (and on mobile so I can't check while typing), but OP mentioned that the venue age requirement wasn't an important detail because they chose the venue because of the age requirement. \n\nPeople from the UK did comment, and apparently, it's normal for clubs to have a 21+ requirement or a separate section for people 25+ because of maturity levels? Idk seems weird to me, but I live in a country where you can vote and die for your country at 18, but you can't drink. So I can't judge.", "She choose Pop World Bar for her wedding. Did a quick google search and it says you have to be 18+ to enter and show some ID.", "Apparently it\u2019s 16 if there is a parent present.", "Weddings are life cycle events, and those are things which enhance the bonds of extended family.", "It\u2019s not trying to use someone else\u2019s event as a reunions. Weddings just have a lot of family gathered so it\u2019s natural to treat it as a reunion. My 90 year-old grandma wouldn\u2019t have flown almost 20 hours for a family reunion, but she did for my wedding.", "Clearly not the intention, just a lot of people would see it as a happy side effect.", ">Specific-Garlic-1036 \u00b7 31 min. ago  \n>  \n>Which is sort of wild.  Don\u2019t try and use someone else\u2019s event as your cheap reunion.   Host a reunion yourself\n\nOh Jesus Christ, grow up.", "She\u2019s not excluding her brother. She\u2019s saying his kids aren\u2019t invited. That\u2019s not the same.", "I just read a detail in another comment that I don't get why OP left out well wanting a favorable judgement. The venue has a 21+ rule. If it's a venue rule that makes a big difference\n\nIf I made a post here and was fishing for a favorable outcome I might include one of the biggest details in my favor.", "IME most venues will relax the rules at a wedding reception but that depends very much on the feelings of the owner/management, the character of the local area and the social classes involved. \n\n\nFor example a lot of venues will flat out refuse to let Travellers book their venue or function rooms because there is a perception that the event will involve trouble, fighting etc. Technically it's illegal to discriminate but it's very difficult to prove; most venues will suddenly be fully booked when they hear a common Traveller surname, or if they think the person trying to book sounds like a Traveller, or if there are a lot of Travellers in the local area, that sort of thing.\n\nOn the other hand I've been to plenty of private functions - weddings, christenings, confirmation celebrations etc - where someone books a function room or reserves an area in a pub and children are present and there'll be one staff member serving drinks who isn't going to directly serve a drink to someone who can't prove they're over 18, but is also not going to be going around making sure Uncle Joe isn't buying drinks for his 17 year old nephew. \n\n\nUsually an underage drinker who's surrounded by older family and family friends isn't going to get into any trouble and has people looking after them, making sure they don't go overboard or get alcohol poisoning, as opposed to being in a pub full of 18 year olds, is the thinking. Also, they're not going to cause more work or problems for the staff.\n\nA lot of places won't accept bookings for Debs (graduation) celebrations either, for similar reasons, afaik that's not illegal.", "And they can do whatever they want. The problem is in op whining because people are taken aback. Like stfu you are creating a problem for a lot of people and making others feel shitty. Accept it and stop acting like you aren\u2019t being shitty yourself", "OP doesn\u2019t seem angry to me\u2026 more like baffled that people are contacting her to tell her they can\u2019t sort childcare 18 months in advance. Fine, but assuming invites went out with RSVPs, simply RSVP \u2018No\u2019 & leave it at that.", "Idk. If 18 yr olds can\u2019t come and are family members they could babysit. Lol", "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go so far to say you\u2019re an asshole, but to not have adults at the wedding seems odd and sort of targeted in exclusion. They can just not go, though. so i guess NaH", "None of our nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends\u2019 children under the age of 21 have been invited due to our decision to have an adult-only wedding at a 21+ venue. \n\nIt is not targeted, merely a wedding we\u2019d like to have and I\u2019m positing whether we (my partner and I) should be seen as assholes because of what we want to do, for us. \n\nThank you for your opinion.", "Not gonna lie if I was an 18-20 year old in this family I'd rent a huge hall get all the addresses of everyone who has kids 20 and under and invite all the kids and charge like $30 per kid for a huge sleepover/shut-in have a carnival, movies, pizza, popcorn, bouncy house etc etc and split the money with anyone 17 and over who helps with the little ones. (After expenses) lol\nI'd see it as a money making opportunity!", "So 21 is 5 YEARS over the drinking age.  That makes it so much worse!", "Their name is UKBookEditor - I\u2019m gonna assume they\u2019re from the UK", "OP has confirmed multiple times that she is in the UK.", "OP was vague enough that there is likely some 18-20 year olds being impacted.  Otherwise OP would not have chosen a 21 and older venue.\n\nBut yes it does sound like this policy is mostly targeted to her brothers kids which is strange on its own.", "I got thrown out of a place in Boston for being 24, so that\u2019s not true", "Nah drinking age is 18 where OP is.  This has nothing to do with alcohol which is what is so puzzling to well me at least.  It\u2019s like why ban adults from places sans drinking age.", "Not necessarily, I\u2019m British, drinking age 18, but there are some over 21 venues.", "LOL.", "She clearly doesn't want certain parents there. Whether they're relatives or friends, who knows? I hope no one turns up.", "I think it's that OP didn't want kids in general, then found a venue they liked that was 21+ only, liked it, and thought \"well that sets the age limit as well so it's perfect.\"", "OP mentioned the bar she was using and I did a google search and it is telling me that you have to be 18+ and a UK resident to enter.", "She\u2019s getting married in Pop World? Each to their own but Jesus Christ", "Not to everyone.  For a lot of people has nil to do with extended family, but is all about chosen family.", "If full family with kids isn\u2019t important enough to go to a reunion for, should be no problem not at a wedding", "Makes no sense to be upset then when someone doesn\u2019t want that if it\u2019s just a sometimes bonus", "Grow up and host a reunion, problem solved", "Excluding your nieces and nephews at your wedding is very much a dick move if you have any semblance of a close relationship with your siblings.\n\nThis is one of those situations where anyone commenting online supports the \"your wedding your choice\" philosophy, but if it were someone you actually knew personally, you would absolutely think they were an asshole.", "She specifically chose a 21+ venue in order to exclude guests 18-20.", "Reading between the lines OP chose the venue Because it was 21 and up.  Since the drinking age is 18 where OP is whatever is driving the 21+ rule has nothing to do with drinking laws in Britain.", "Some people don\u2019t want to leave their kids though? I didn\u2019t leave my daughter with anyone til she was 3 and even then it was only with my mum, to this day I wouldn\u2019t go to a wedding without her. She\u2019s allowed to have no kids but of course people are going to say no.", "I suspect they\u2019re hoping she\u2019ll change her mind. They\u2019ll give up eventually.", "I mean, most people don't expect their siblings to exclude their children from the wedding...", "They could, but how would you feel as an 18 year old being excluded with the children?", "It very much feels like you're abdicating the responsibility for having a 21+ wedding to the venue, when it was you that booked the venue.", "You said yourself that the coice of venue was deliberate to be a place only over 21. If this has the appearance of targeting family members, good luck getting anything good out of that.", "That sounds really fun. I'd rather do that than go to a wedding.", "Yeah. It\u2019s so obviously not the reason but because it aligns with US laws people are getting confused.\n\nMy bet is that OP is trying to exclude someone but doesn\u2019t like conflict so has made up a weird old age child policy.", "If that's the case, then you're right and I have completely changed my mind regarding the concern about minors and alcohol.\n\nI still think it's her rule and like someone else said, the family is free to feel how they want to feel.", "That is truly bizarre and not at all common.", "I\u2019m British and it just so happens that the venue is 21+. That\u2019s quite common over here, I feel, no? Like, some places don\u2019t let you hire them unless you\u2019re,\n21, 25+ and, sometimes, even 30 and over.", "Exclusive as it goes.\n\nPopworld.\n\nThis has to be a wind up.", "Gotta say your vows on the revolving dance floor", "Definitely possible even likely. Still if I was OP I would have included that information. All in all OP just doesn't seem to like people.", "I mean I love my nieces and nephews but if I were to get married I wouldn't necessarily want them there. It doesn't mean I love them any less, just that I don't need them to be in every part of my life. I'm also the type that doesn't introduce girlfriends to family pretty much at all and am far from settling down so I could see my opinion on it changing by the time I ever find myself in that position.", "And being stuck babysitting? No thanks", "For the specific reason of it being a 21+ venue too.", "That everyone in her family sees through and is reacting accordingly to.", "Maybe they don\u2019t do it anymore, but you had to be 24 if you had an out of state license at a bunch of places. Bizarre and I\u2019ve never encountered it anywhere else. It does exist though", "Literally never heard of it for a wedding. Unless you\u2019ve chosen a nightclub.", "It's really not common in the UK to host a wedding at a 21+ venue. I've been to dozens of weddings. I've planned or helped to plan three weddings. Not once have I come across an over 21 wedding venue. The fact that they exist doesn't change the fact that no one would ever expect a 21+ rule for a wedding in the UK.", "30 & over? Um, no. I\u2019ve never heard that one\u2026", "I\u2019ve not run into that here on the other side of the pond so that may be  affecting perception of your post (nor have I run into that for hiring either, other than being over 18).", "I get the not generally liking people vibe too, lol", "Yep, Pop World.", "I mean do they exist though? I\u2019ve lived in the UK my entire life and never heard of anywhere with a higher than necessary age limit. I mean it\u2019s not like as a country we really give that much of a shit about underage drinking. I went to a wedding at 15 and my uncle was surprised I wasn\u2019t drinking!", "No one would have their wedding at pop world, your taking the piss now. Plus it's not a 21 venue", "Pop world isn't 21+ for events", "Just did a quick google of Pop World Bar UK and if I am looking at the right place it says 18+ is allowed but will probably need an ID."]}
