So after my mom remarried I was unhappy and I refused to let her husband adopt me, I refused to call him my dad, I corrected people who would mistake him or call him my dad.

A couple of times he and my mom went to get the adoption and a change of my last name through. But each time the judge wanted to speak to me and I would say I didn't want a different last name and I didn't want to be adopted. My mom would get so upset with me when the judge would refuse the adoption or the name change. She would ask me why I had to do that.\n\nI was 12 mom and her husband decided they should just have a child of their own and he focused way less on me. Though she kept saying I should be letting him in and she knew I wanted a dad. Mom did get pregnant a year later but she miscarried at 15 weeks and ended up really sick from it. She was hospitalized for about two months after the miscarriage. My grandpa (mom's dad) stepped in and took me to my grandparents (dad's parents) where I wanted to go when I was faced with being left with my mom's husband and grandma made me not want to go with them. It caused a lot of drama afterward and when mom recovered she and her husband were stunned that I would choose to go somewhere else when something happened to mom. \n\nMom and I started fighting a lot in the last 16 months and two months ago she decided we all needed family therapy. But the therapist refused to see the three of us together and said mom and I needed therapy together, just the two of us, first.\n\nIt was two weeks ago when, after mom had been saying for weeks how she did her best for me, she did what she felt was right and what she knew I wanted, I told her that she was wrong to speak about what I wanted instead of just saying she did what she thought was right. I told her I never wanted a new dad. I told her I felt she remarried way too fast. I told her I felt like she just replaced dad and said fuck you to him, which wasn't fair. And I said I never agreed with how she handled things. I told her what I needed the most after dad died was her, was comfort, was the chance to get used to life without him before throwing some rando in and trying to make him my new dad. I didn't get to say much else because mom zeroed in on the fact I said she was wrong and asked how could I say that because she's my mom and she knows me better than anyone does.

I am both better and worse for it, as it\u2019s unfortunately likely you will be as well, but you\u2019re NTA on any of this. \n\nThe next time your mom tells you something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re really hurting me with what you\u2019re saying\u201d- and it\u2019s a go-to line in the narc playbook, so she\u2019ll be saying it- tell her something like \u201cyeah, hearing the bad things a person does said back to them would make most people feel bad\u201d.

While I can appreciate that your mother may be shocked because she didn't realize how you felt, she needs to recognize that these conversations are what family therapy is for. \n\nOutside of the therapy sessions, she needs to manage the situation like an adult, respect the process, and do the hard work of her navigating her own complicated emotions.", "Tell her you\u2019re your own person and you have feelings that cannot be changed at will.

I would ask her \u201cso if I died, would you just get another girl from somewhere, call her your daughter and that\u2019s that?\u201d That is basically what she was asking you to do.

Good luck to you.", "Absolutely NTA. My wife\u2019s mom used to pull this kind of crap regularly. My wife doesn\u2019t share a dad with any of her three siblings. Her mom would always try to force them to accept and call her new husband(she\u2019s been married 5 times) dad. When I got into the picture, she was leaving marriage 3 and heading to marriage 4. I watched as she tried to make her younger kids(my wife is the oldest) call the new guy dad, to which the 2 directly younger than my wife refused, while the youngest did. Moving along to marriage 5, same attempt, same result. It was maddening to watch this woman think you can just force someone to accept a new man as dad. \n\nYour mom was acting selfishly, not in your best interest, by trying to get you to call him dad. I can\u2019t say she was moving too fast because Love is a very complex thing and I don\u2019t feel I have the right to speak on how someone else feels, but I absolutely can appreciate how it was too fast for you, and am truly sorry you had to go through that. But getting remarried is one thing, trying to make your child call the new man dad is a WHOLE other thing, and a massive problem. The title of \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d isn\u2019t forced, it\u2019s earned. In the words of Yondu(Guardian\u2019s of the Galaxy reference) \u201cHe may have been your father boy, but he wadn\u2019t your daddy.\u201d A person only ever gets to be dad or mom when the child feels that level of connection, respect, and love for that person. They were MASSIVELY in the wrong for trying to make you call him that, and even more so for trying to do the adoption and name change without your consent, which shows she wasn\u2019t acting in your best interest, but on her own desires. Really sorry you had to go through all of that", "NTA\n\nWOW.. tell me you're a narcissist without telling me you're a narcissist, this woman needs a reality check.\n\nHow dare she say she knows you better than yourself? How dare she say she's never wrong just because she's your mom? Especially when she doesn't seem to be a good one to start with? What does she think she is? A god? She needs to get over her self, she didn't do what she believed you wanted, she did what she knew SHE wanted.\n\nShe was scared as fu_ck by the idea that she will have to raise you alone and she didn't know how to do it, which is understandable, so her solution was to marry someone else, she didn't want to feel guilty about her decision so she deluded her self into thinking that you wanted this and that it was for you, to support this stupid idea she tried everything to get you to be adopted by said husband, but then you didn't want it and that's when her plan to live happily and guilt free ended, because if she actually listened to what YOU wanted then she will have to face the reality and accept that she did what she did only for herself.\n\nShe doesn't want to solve things nor does she want to come to an understanding, she just wants to corner you in front of a therapist in hopes that they will support her and you will finally just do as she says, she won't listen because the moment she does she will have to accept that this is all her fault and that she has no right to force you to get over your father, and by doing that, she's betraying both you and him.\n\nUnless someone gave this woman a wake up call, and she actually stopped being in denial nothing is ever going to change.", "NTA however I don't hold much hope for this therapy because she doesn't want to hear it.", "Neither do I.

It wasn't for you, it was for her. Trying to force her new husband on you is absolutely ridiculous and you have zero obligation to accept him as any sort of parental figure especially when they're threatening you and trying to coerce you.

We could all use a mental oil change from time to time.", "NTA. \n\nFor personal context, my dad remarried when I was 12 to give me a mom and I resented them for years because they would try so hard to force her as my parent. I hated her so much. I told them I didn\u2019t want a new mom. I didn\u2019t want to be adopted. I fantasized about cutting her out of my life and moving away. I didn\u2019t want to hear her be called my mom and would correct anyone who said it. Once they gave up and I did move away she actually became of of my very best friends. We talk daily. Haven\u2019t spoken to my dad in a long time and he passed recently. \n\nBack to forcing a stepparent on a child\u2014maybe you can see some parallels here. It didn\u2019t matter to my dad because \u201che knew me best\u201d. Reality is he wanted to be married and supported and was projecting those feeling to me. Heaven forbid he be the one in need and not his child. Guy couldn\u2019t admit to being vulnerable ever. We never actually spoke about my mom for more than a second in passing while growing up\u2014really felt like she was thrown away. You\u2019re not the asshole. Your mom probably isn\u2019t going to take ownership of her mistakes or personal faults and that\u2019s okay as long as you know you are not the problem here. Parents aren\u2019t perfect people and adults rarely truly understand when they are fucking up in the long term. It\u2019s ok to tell the truth and it does not matter if it hurts her feelings because you don\u2019t need to spoon feed your parent kindness.  \n\nI hope you can see some similarities between our situations. So please don\u2019t fall into the trap of yearning/demanding for her to truly understand you. Say your piece and then when she doesn\u2019t understand (or doesn\u2019t even try to understand) you just have to go \u201cok Susan\u201d and move on with your life. There is no winning in the family relationship game.

Hope the therapist can help her have a breakthrough, but until that happens, know that you were correct in what you said. You needed her, and that would have been enough to learn a new normal.

She should have had your back.", "NTA, please please please use this time with the therapist to get all your thoughts and feelings out whether or not Mom accepts or wants to hear it.

Anything repeated enough often becomes the truth in your brain. And then you act on it. \n\nTrying to reality reference can be really hard. It's also likely why the mom is doubling down on \"but you needed a dad\".\n\nYet - \"I know you better because I'm your mom\". That is toxic af. And very \"adults know all, kids know nothing\" and exactly why at least two of my friends have health issues as their parents ignored symptoms and complaints because \"they knew best\". One of my friends is deaf in one ear precisely because her parents 'knew better than her'.", "Very true!!"]}
