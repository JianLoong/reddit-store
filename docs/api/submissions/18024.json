He\u2019s on disability currently. I\u2019m a medical student so I\u2019m typically very good with communicating with other doctors on my families behalf. He started living with me and my fiance in 2020, 4 years prior my brother was diagnosed with end stage renal disease and CHF. This was preceeded by hypertension due to a poor diet and not seeing physicians for 30 years. After having to be put on dialysis 5 years ago, it\u2019s been tough. I was shocked to see that he has made no dietary changes,eats fast food 24/7, completely avoids vegetables and mostly drinks soda and juice. Even when I would cook he seemed disgusted if it was remotely healthy but I cook VERY well. \n\nThen he was presented with the option of kidney transplant last year. I started attending his many appointments with him and noticed that he was falsely reporting his symptoms (saying he could walk a mile when I watched him struggle to walk 10 feet to my car), he even denied having CHF at his cardiac clearance. This is the norm. He is very poor on follow up for appointments and struggles with giving his health history. He inaccurately reports his health record and has deferred it to me. We moved out in October because I couldn\u2019t take living with him. He was storing bags of poop under the couch were he would nap, and he kept trash around. In addition he has poor personal hygiene (does not shower, wash hands or brush teeth). \n\nIn February he was on the table for a non invasive procedure and he flatlined. Doctors realized that his heart was in worse condition than they had realized. He was no longer a candidate for kidney transplant. We encouraged him to go to a short rehab to regain his strength after his ICU stay and he refused despite the hospital encouraging him. He went home and my fiance and I became much more hands off. His nephew moved in to be a roommate for him in one of our homes and we live 5 minutes away. \n\nAt the end of April he was admitted to the hospital and they\u2019re saying that his heart is at end stage of failure. He can\u2019t tolerate dialysis and his only option is to get a double transplant (heart and kidney) or go to palliative care. This comes after being told in the past that he wasn\u2019t a candidate for heart and kidney, however after continuously saying he wanted to live they\u2019ve started to screen him. They\u2019re stating that he would need a very strong support system in order to be a candidate. I\u2019m truly disturbed that they\u2019re considering this for him. He has a very poor support system outside of me and truthfully I\u2019ll be back busy in med school soon since I\u2019ll be finishing up my dual degree. (my fianc\u00e9 provides financially but works ALOT). He listed myself, his two brothers and nephew as his support system, and two of those individuals are very unreliable. \n\nI\u2019m at the point of considering telling the social workers the truth when they call me this time!

Patients don't hop off the operating table as good as new. They can develop infections, organ rejection, blood clots, strokes, and on and on. Our friend got a single lung transplant for pulmonary fibrosis.
