He\u2019s on disability currently. I\u2019m a medical student so I\u2019m typically very good with communicating with other doctors on my families behalf. He started living with me and my fiance in 2020, 4 years prior my brother was diagnosed with end stage renal disease and CHF. This was preceeded by hypertension due to a poor diet and not seeing physicians for 30 years. After having to be put on dialysis 5 years ago, it\u2019s been tough. I was shocked to see that he has made no dietary changes,eats fast food 24/7, completely avoids vegetables and mostly drinks soda and juice. Even when I would cook he seemed disgusted if it was remotely healthy but I cook VERY well. \n\nThen he was presented with the option of kidney transplant last year. I started attending his many appointments with him and noticed that he was falsely reporting his symptoms (saying he could walk a mile when I watched him struggle to walk 10 feet to my car), he even denied having CHF at his cardiac clearance. This is the norm. He is very poor on follow up for appointments and struggles with giving his health history. He inaccurately reports his health record and has deferred it to me. We moved out in October because I couldn\u2019t take living with him. He was storing bags of poop under the couch were he would nap, and he kept trash around. In addition he has poor personal hygiene (does not shower, wash hands or brush teeth). \n\nIn February he was on the table for a non invasive procedure and he flatlined. Doctors realized that his heart was in worse condition than they had realized. He was no longer a candidate for kidney transplant. We encouraged him to go to a short rehab to regain his strength after his ICU stay and he refused despite the hospital encouraging him. He went home and my fiance and I became much more hands off. His nephew moved in to be a roommate for him in one of our homes and we live 5 minutes away. \n\nAt the end of April he was admitted to the hospital and they\u2019re saying that his heart is at end stage of failure. He can\u2019t tolerate dialysis and his only option is to get a double transplant (heart and kidney) or go to palliative care. This comes after being told in the past that he wasn\u2019t a candidate for heart and kidney, however after continuously saying he wanted to live they\u2019ve started to screen him. They\u2019re stating that he would need a very strong support system in order to be a candidate. I\u2019m truly disturbed that they\u2019re considering this for him. He has a very poor support system outside of me and truthfully I\u2019ll be back busy in med school soon since I\u2019ll be finishing up my dual degree. (my fianc\u00e9 provides financially but works ALOT). He listed myself, his two brothers and nephew as his support system, and two of those individuals are very unreliable. \n\nI\u2019m at the point of considering telling the social workers the truth when they call me this time!

He has not been doing either.", "NTA.\ntransplant recipient here! unfortunately i have to say, i\u2019d tell them the truth about your brother in law. in my opinion, you have to earn the right for a transplant. like if an alcoholic were in need of a liver transplant and still drinking, they would not be eligible for a liver transplant because the doctors would consider it a wasted organ. it makes me mad as a transplant recipient that your BIL isn\u2019t taking his health seriously but is so entitled to still think he has the right to get new organs when he isn\u2019t even trying to help or salvage the ones he has now. i can guarantee if he isn\u2019t making the healthy and right changes for the transplant, he won\u2019t make the right changes for the transplant afterwards and will end up in the same spot or worse after the transplant too.\n\ngood luck to you guys but NTA, i\u2019d just tell the truth, it\u2019s a don\u2019t shoot the messenger type of situation.", "He stores poop in bags in his home. He should have been reported to his social worker a long time ago because he needs help other than a transplant.\nNTA.", "NTA. You know whats going to happen. He's going to die. And as a future physician you'll see it all the time. What use will it be to give your BiL a kidney when he's going to continue on with his kidney destroying lifestyle? How long will his life be extended? Could someone else use that kidney to better effect?\n\nThose are the hard questions. Realistically none of us here should answer them. But focusing strictly on the question of whether you should tell his social worker about his history, thereby barring him from the transplant entirely, the answer is no. Simply withdraw your support and go low contact. You are not beholden to his lifestyle just because you are family adjacent. If you need to explain yourself to family, do so but don't sugarcoat it like you didn't in this post.", "NTA.\n\nSomeone who deserves those organs, by that, I mean someone who is going to eat healthy, exercise,not drink and ruin those two new organs- should get them. The doctors need to know the truth.", "Info : why are you the POa of your BIL ? Your husband really pawned it of on you and you're ok with it ? Can't your husband make decision about his family,  not it's you. Wow", "NTA. If he cannot do the work that it takes now, he will not have a miraculous turn around just because he gets a transplant. That is an incredibly difficult surgery and recovery period but also, life afterwards is forever changed. It\u2019s a life of medication snd complications, and he will need extensive therapy just to recover. He will need to manage his weight, have significant diet restrictions, and will have to commit to. regular exercise or he will die and take that organ with him. \n\nNobody is asking you to make the decision. Just be honest to the social workers and let the transplant team make the call because this is their job. This decision isn\u2019t on you. His health and the decisions that led him to this point are on him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s scared, but he chose not to take the necessary steps that he knew could have prevented this. I\u2019m not trying to make the call or tell you to, just tell the social workers the truth so they can make the right decision.", "NTA - it\u2019s not fair for him to get a new heart and kidney that he will just ruin again and someone who would care for it will die.", "Nta\nLife for an organ donor recipient involves complex ongoing care and compliance with restrictive treatment regimes. Your BIL has not shown he is willing or able to comply with treatment. As others have pointed out, tell the treatment team the truth and lie your ass off to the family members harassing you. \"Oh I'm sorry I did all I could but they made the decision . Of course I supported him.\" If you argue or try to change the family members minds, they will think you can be won over or worn down.", "I don't know about this story. Obviously NTA. However you say you are a medical student that communicates well with doctors yet comes to Reddit for advice on a major health decision instead of the health team that should know all this, which yes includes a case manager. You say you understand illnesses and what a transplant entails, yet you are not sure to tell his providers. Just saying", "NTA.  Don't take a heart away from someone who can actually live a full life with it.", "Exactly. If he gets it, when his transplant fails because he's noncompliant it sounds like family will use you as a scapegoat. They're already trying to put blame/responsibility on you. You've gone above and beyond already. Take care of yourself", "I have a genuine question, how is it possible for him to lie about his heart condition? The medical team normally asks for the paperwork from the cardiologist and any other specialist before doing any procedure, and if the patient doesnt give them, they call the other doctors directly? (I was thinking about the flatlining thing).\nIn your country maybe, if he changes hospitals there is no communication between the different medical teams? I am curious how it works!\nHe can easily lie about his life habits, but i am surprised about him being able to hide medical results", "NTA\n\nA support system exists to help support a commitment that already exists.\n\nYour BIL has shown time and time again he doesn\u2019t have a commitment to his health - and trying to outsource the responsibility to you isn\u2019t fair and isn\u2019t likely to work.\n\nAs you pointed out, you\u2019ll also be busy. It\u2019s utter hypocrisy to be angry at you when they themselves don\u2019t step up.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean this situation isn\u2019t sad; and ultimately no matter what judgement you get here, you are the one who is going to have to live with your decision.", "Yep. Tell the truth. Also, don't forget that there are limited organs. If he gets them through lying, he'll be taking them from someone else.", "Medical doctor here myself. My medical opinion is that Lying is not helping him, and my \u201cwas once a med student\u201d opinion is that you cannot be his primary carer and function well in medical school. I would discuss with one of your student support/counselling systems available through your uni, because whatever you decide you will almost certainly feel awful and so you need to make this decision with professional backup to help you through the process.", "My cousin's spouse waited 2 years for a heart. They had an LVAD for 2 years while waiting for a heart. Got a call one day that a heart was available. Went to the hospital, and just before they put them under, the doctors discovered something wrong with the heart. No surgery for them that day. Just by luck, they got a call the following week, and they were able to do the surgery. \n\nMy cousin's spouse lived for 2 years and 2 months after their heart transplant. These 2 years allowed them to spend time with their young kids. They died in their mid 40s. This was a person who worked 40 hours a week while on the LVAD, helped raise their kids, and helped with housework. They also went back to work once able after the transplant. \n\nI say all this because the heart they received was a gift. A gift of life. Something that they weren't going to sit around and let go to waste. Never once did my cousin's spouse poop in bags because they were too tired or lazy to get up from the couch. Never once did they not provide for themselves and their family. Never once did they do something that the doctors said they shouldn't do. Why? Because even with a transplant, your days are numbered. Please, do NOT lie and deceive the doctors to let the gift of life go to someone who won't appreciate it or utilize it to its fullest potential. Doing so could result in a child missing out on having a parent in their lives for a bit longer. \n\nI am sorry you are in the situation. You are going to med school. You are going to be required to take an oath to do no harm. So think to yourself... are you going to do harm to someone who would truly benefit from a new organ by lying so that your BIL could receive a new organ to let it waste away?\n\nYou would be NTA if you told the truth. Ultimately, your BIL is responsible for his own poor health choices.", "Adding to this, there are other people who need those organs. I had two aunts who had a few kidney transplants after their kidneys failed as teenagers (hereditary illness). They looked after their bodies, did dialysis when the organ failed and they had to go back on the transplant list. They both died in their sixties from conditions brought on by the cocktail of meds they had to take to maintain their transplanted organs. They were both immensely, vocally grateful for the fifty years of life those donors had given them. By supporting your BIL\u2019s lie, you are reducing the chances for donors who will do the right thing to get a transplant. It\u2019s a tough decision to make but you know he isn\u2019t going to respect the organ or make the changes\nEdited: typos", "So unfair and hard for you. You have to live with your decision.  You make the decision that sits the best with you, in your heart.  You are training to be a doctor, you are  already a wonderful caring compassionate person. You have done a hell of a  lot for him.  As someone else mentioned no one has to know what you said if asked in private interviews.", "Yeah but one heart saves one person not several. It cannot be split in two.", "NTA.\n\nIt occurred to me, how would the donor's loved ones feel if they knew the BIL's lifestyle choices and that they lied about those choices just to get on the transplant list?  Honestly, I  think it would be a tragic waste of those organs.  The medical staff don't judge, they just implant the organs in the next compatible person on the list.  BIL says he wants to live, but he does nothing to show it.", "Hes going to waste a heart and kidney and die. Nta", "NTA\n\nFor his sake you need to tell the truth", "\\*This\\* is the most important point.", "And he's already proved he won't look after himself. This is a horrible situation, but OP is definitely NTA, and WNBTA if they told the social/healthcare workers the truth.", "NTA. I know this sounds harsh, but organs would be a waste for someone like him as he doesn\u2019t take care of himself or even make an attempt to change his lifestyle.", "NTA - if he is still eating junk food then why would anybody expect you to make sacrifices if he isn't?\n\nYour husband (assuming he is your husband's brother) or his actual blood relatives need to pick up this load and do the work they are asking you to do.\n\nIt might be that you need to move out of this residence.  Move in with other medical students and no patients.", "Oh okay! Thanks for your answer! And I also think you should be honest with the medical team :) if he doesnt take care of himself he will die even with the transplant. He'll have to take anti rejection drugs aml his life, have a strict diet, watch out for infections...\n\nThe way you describe it, it seems that he will just \"waste\" organs that could have been donated to someone else. Anyway...NTA, tell them and let the team decide", "Im not POA. Lol I said I represent him when speaking with doctors. My fianc\u00e9 is poa but obviously that only matters when he\u2019s unconscious or unable to speak for himself. I stepped it when it became clear he was not communicating well with his physicians. It might be important to state that neither of us are his blood relatives. We\u2019ve taken him in as family, he worked for my fianc\u00e9 and helped him with something life changing years ago, so he feels indebted.", "He hasn\u2019t been following a cardiologist regularly, he was diagnosed with heart failure and never followed with a cardiologist afterwards. So the cardiac clearance team who saw him for his kidney transplant was almost starting at Square one. And as long as he was on dialysis they couldn\u2019t see his true ejection fraction due to the removal of fluids and the one procedure he got was a heart procedure being done to ensure that he was able to clear for the surgery. But at this point his heart could not support anesthesia and they realized he was way worse off when during the procedure his ejection fraction was only 21%.", "Why would you assume this was the only place I\u2019ve consulted?", "He has no spouse, never married and doesn\u2019t have a partner.", "My fianc\u00e9 and I no longer live with him. After the poop in bag discovery and the persistent messiness we had to go and now live 5 minutes away. But we distanced after we realized he was not caring for himself. We are only stepping back in now due to him being hospitalized for almost a month. He truly has no blood relatives invested in his care. His blood brother has left us picking up his slack for years.", "OP should tell the truth about the amount of care she can provide. The information about other family members is not hers to give.", "How guilty would you feel if you lied, he got the transplants, and (for lack of a better term) kinda wasted them? NTA. I think you'll regret lying more than not lying.", "Because consulting with a bunch of randos on reddit about such a serious question is idiotic."]}
