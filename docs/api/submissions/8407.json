So drug test comes back negative with a faint line, but two lines period means negative. My stepmom works on healthcare and went ahead and said that means positive which completely goes against what the test says. \n\nMy dad and stepmom convinced I smoked weed, decided to take my car away, I didn\u2019t really care because at that point I was fed up with the bullshit.\n\nSo fast forward to Christmas Day, My stepmom calls me and says that I need to come home so they can open presents. I borrowed my grandpas truck and went home. I get home and my brother hears me and comes running out his room to give me a hug, when he did this, he saw all of his Christmas presents that were on the open floor and completely missed his reaction to it, my stepmom then continues to scream at me saying the following \u201cAre you fucking high? Did you loose brain cells from smoking weed? Like are you really that fucking stupid\u201d she then tells my dad that I went in his room and accused me of waking him up to show him his presents. My dad then yells at me saying I ruined Christmas for them. I told him that he needs to stop siding with her all the time just to make her happy because it\u2019s honestly bullshit. \n\nHe then tells me to go apologize to her, I told him \u201cI love you but I\u2019m not doing that, She owes me an apology if anything\u201d he says \u201ctime then say goodbye to your car\u201d so they sold the car the next day *$14,000 ford that I paid about $6000 of* they also told me that I will have to find somewhere else to live through college.
