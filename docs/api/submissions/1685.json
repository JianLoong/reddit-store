I completely believe that the parents made a very poor decision to not seek help.

So for one day, to spend it with someone who you don't just supposedly love, but bothered to bring into this world, and react this way, is just mind boggling to me.

I would push myself to do what you\u2019re demanding but it would come at high cost to my mental health and I\u2019d be stressed and paying for it for days if it was me.

How are you not angry about that?", "Absolutely NTA. Get a new planner, and congrats on your wedding.", "OP has an uncanny parallel life except it's just my mother who has developed a reclusive personality, and wedding is not imminent (but will happen). I haven't been on a holiday with parents for years, and her last time outside 5km radius was a few months ago but mostly in a car and to take a different member of family back home. My comment will swing and look at it from both sides, it should take you on a rollercoaster before my solution/verdict. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople saying if you have problems you shouldn't be a parent, I think my mum's mental health declined after some time in the parenthood, she wasn't troubled before and she took child rearing seriously - infact too seriously so I think her tensed mentality made her unravel among culture shock and tonnes of things wearing her down. + cultural stigma means she wont accept it,  she struggles to find a therapist that connects with her without huge cultural and experience gaps. She's a great mom - weave had a lot of problems, but it comes from the best place from her and even with our friction she is my mum.\n\nMy mum likely wouldn't want to be at my wedding she wont want the attentions etc, so she has set up her boundaries (just because your are a mum doesn't mean you cant have boundaries and refuse to make a speech if she wouldn't do it for anyone else). I could have read parts wrong so correct me, but your parents said they will join as long as they are not at the front... and they still attended parents evenings albeit online/ phone.. aka they still spent time with you, just working around their boundaries. and they were willing to witness the wedding and be there at an important ceremony.. they took the compromise, so what's the fuss. There is a huge emphasis that you are an asshole if you do not conform to arbitrary societal normal like straight out of an American sitcom, we are allowed to have quirky unresolved patterns (as long as it's not like drinking etc where it revolves into straight up neglect/ abuse). Too many people here on AITA would look at my phobia of fire and say oh you won't go to an event with your future kid because fire terrifies you, you are a monster for not resolving it, we can let people have their seemingly arbitrary fears and ways because at this rate anyone so much as scares of a spider is broken and is an asshole for not going to therapy.\n\nThere is a lot of people here assuming too my parents (by my uncannily similar life to OP) that the parents are horrible people when really they have flaws and we should accept people and their quirkiness. But do tell me if I have read something totally wrong and it isn't the case and the parents just really don't care. Lot of people here underqualified and never experienced what OP has, so my verdict is NSEAUH Need Some Empathy and Understanding Here. Too may people see anything out of a ''normal wedding format' as worse than Mussolini when really there are very few straight up normal families, we all have quirky members of the family and we love them they way they are despite them embarrassing you once in a while.  We are different people, some are social butterflies and others are less sociable but amazing in their nice quirks and hobbies and everything in-between and they all deserve love - unless you are a racist or entitled. Will add, as I'm still confused with what's going on, they must make some contribution to the wedding for them to not be an asshole, even if they view the wedding 400 meters through binoculars if that's what you both agree during a sit down.

Have they overcome this to accommodate you in the past?\n\nPSA: I'd like to remind other Redditors (this is gonna get me a lot of downvotes) that yes, while a mental health issue is not a get out of jail free card and folks still have to put in effort, **be careful about reinforcing stigma**. Saying \"oh the parents are AH for not putting in enough effort\" is the sort of thing that will make people with MH issues who have had trouble getting help feel even worse about themselves. Anxiety, depression, and many other disorders make it really hard to reach for help, and \"I haven't done enough, I'm not worth it anyways\" is an insidious thought that makes things worse. Don't reinforce that thought.", "NTA, but also some things to consider:\n\n1) Your organizer overstepped. Reaching out to them was inappropriate unless you asked for them to do so. You should address that and take a closer look to be sure that was this person\u2019s only misstep with the planning.\n2) You might want to talk to your parents about how the degree of their isolation isn\u2019t healthy. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being introverted, but the extremes they go to in order to avoid the outside world is not just introversion. And that\u2019s coming from an introvert. Several suggestions have been offered here from all us armchair psychologists/psychiatrists. You may want to read through them and decide if your parents really do need professional help.\n3) Have you considered putting some chairs for them up front and off to the side with a screen or curtain to block people from looking at them? Then they could be at the front with you, but out of sight. You could make it something really pretty with flowers and such in front of it so no one realizes what it is. It would look like part of the decor. Then they could be there, but with a little perceived protection. Just make sure everyone knows they aren\u2019t comfortable interacting.\n4) If they never leave the house, but are willing to show up for your wedding, they\u2019re making an effort, even if they aren\u2019t comfortable with a lot of the other stuff. \n\nI understand that you wish they were less anti-social. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting things to be better. But you may have to find a way to make things better within a restricted framework and only increase by margins the amount of extra interaction they get. \n\nLike, with getting closer to your S/O\u2026 Maybe let your fianc\u00e9 talk to them on the phone for five minutes here and there? Be on the phone for a minute first then and say, \u201cHey, I need my hands for a second here, let me put you on speaker. Oh, say hi to (fianc\u00e9)!\u201d They\u2019ll end up getting to know him a little better if he speaks to them a little that way. Eventually, they may be willing to talk to your fianc\u00e9 without you on the line and maybe he can say, \u201cOh, god! I have NO idea what to get OP for his birthday this year! Can you brainstorm with me?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a story about a woman who goes to the village shaman to ask for help in getting to know her stepson. The shaman tells her that in order to help her, she must first bring him a lion\u2019s whisker. She goes and over the span of several weeks, wins the trust of the lion by approaching it slowly and kindly, a little closer every day, leaving it food and bringing it water. Eventually, it trusted her enough to let her touch its face and she was able to trim a whisker. She took it to the shaman and he took it and tied it into a knot which he sewed to a necklace and hung around her neck. Then he said, \u201cYou must approach your stepson as you did the lion. Slowly, carefully, and with kindness so that he knows you are trustworthy. When you need to be reminded of this, look to the lion\u2019s whisker and remember.\u201d In the end, it worked. Nothing is ever as simple as it is in a story, of course, but the sentiment is still important.\n\nAgain, NTA. I\u2019m just trying to offer some steps towards a balance for you and them. And an immediate solution for them to attend your wedding, because I suspect that you really do want them there. Consider the curtain idea.

Sitting in the front row isn't too much participation. You may be able to explain to them that the wedding party will be the focus not them. But if this was the last straw for you and if it will hurt you too much if they don't do at least some of the parent things at your wedding, then it may be best to not have them there.

Some people shouldn\u2019t have children and that\u2019s alright but it\u2019s unfair of them to not get help when it seems their child has made it very apparent they\u2019re hurt by their parents\u2019 absence in their big life moments. I\u2019d say NTA", "It\u2019s more about lack of necessity. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder since childhood. It wasn\u2019t a big deal when I was younger so I gave into it a lot. The minute I graduated high school it was give into it or be homeless. If they truly cared about having a relationship with their son it would create a sense of urgency to change. They love him, just not as much as they love themselves.", "My grandmother and great-aunt were like this. They did indeed get worse the older they got, to the point where they a) refused to come to my wedding, even when I told them they could stand in the vestibule and leave immediately after the vows and b) refused to go see my dad (my grandmother's only child) when he was dying from cancer in the hospital. I stopped having any contact with them whatsoever as soon as my dad passed, and honestly I don't think it bothered them much at all. My mom stayed in touch and they never once brought up wanting to see me or hear from me.", "Thank you! Your issues aren't your child's problem and if you love them enough, you get thru it. And I say this as someone with actual diagnosed agoraphobia. That isn't what this is at all.

Add in two male parents which may not be very acceptable in their area.  There may be more reasons at play as to why they feel safe in their neighborhood and not elsewhere.", "I never said OP's parents can use it as a cop-out? Of course they failed as parents. Hence me saying it makes a lot of sense that OP gives them consequences.\n\nBut the thing with mental problems is that you can't apply logical statements like this. Of course they should have solved their problems before bringing a child in their home. But they probably weren't of the capacity, due to their mental problems, to recognize that themselves. That's not an excuse, but it is an explanation that led to a sad situation. But telling OP things like \"if they loved you they would have looked for help\" is not helpful to OP and is far from the truth. They weren't able to help themselves, despite loving OP. It is really sad. But telling someone their parents didn't love them is just making the situation worse.", "It's interesting, because they had to go to school, they had to meet each other, etc etc etc.  I think they figured out a way to cocoon, and didn't stop to see how it impacted their child.", "I agree. Parents are selfish and no disorder excuses them. I think they have enabled and normalized the problem and have excused themselves for emotionally neglecting their child. They are self centered jerks.", "I did agree with NTA in every comment. I just think people underestimate what people in this kind of situation can consider normal because they find it normal. They think \"other people do it different, but we do it this way and that is fine too\". It wasn't fine. They weren't right. But withental problems like this there is no logic. They don't recognize their own wrongdoing. It is clear in all their actions.\n\nI am not saying OP is wrong. I'm saying people telling op that her parents didn't love her because they would've gotten help for her sake are wrong. They are making it more difficult for op, they aren't right probably and they aren't recognizing how difficult the situation is. OP has been forced to a very difficult point that parents that clearly care about OP simply aren't mentally well enough to be parents and in her life. That is incredible hard, to remove well-intentioned people from your life that you have some kind of love for, not only resentment. People telling op those things aren't recognizing that.", "I don't think it is a matter of loving, but a matter of being in their capacity. Just because you got a sense of urgency and changed doesn't mean they could. Unfortunately, not everyone deals with it in a good way, like OP's parents. They are offended they aren't invited to the wedding and that is a big hint they are so deep I'm they don't even recognize what they did. They won't, no matter how big their love.", "OP's parents are a man and a woman; OP is the one getting married to a man. If anything I would suspect the parents might be homophobic. Also, I'm not clear on how \"festival\" and \"neighborhood\" imply they're not in the US or Europe.", "I respect that pov a lot. Can\u2019t change the past. I think I feel for OP because my parents took care of my physical needs but weren\u2019t there for me emotionally and dont listen when I explain how that hurt. Going off of OP\u2019s reaction I can empathize with how it feels to beg and beg for your parents to be parents and them not giving a single inch. It doesn\u2019t sound like OP\u2019s parents even care to change or acknowledge how they\u2019re failing their child which to me is the biggest problem. Even if they truly can\u2019t do anything about their issues and simply will never be able to be at the wedding in the capacity OP wants, they don\u2019t seem to be acknowledging OP\u2019s sadness. If OP needs to uninvite them to the biggest day of their life for them\nto finally understand then I support it. But if even that doesn\u2019t cause them to at LEAST consider that they need help, then it\u2019s better they aren\u2019t there anyways in my opinion.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying though when you realize your world is about to be upturned \u201ccapacity\u201d doesn\u2019t matter. The landlord and government wouldn\u2019t really give a shit if working wasn\u2019t in my capacity bc I had anxiety attacks everyday. If their boss decided no more work from home be in the office by 8am next week. If they were at risk of becoming homeless from that, they would be in that office at 8am. Ok maybe love isn\u2019t the right word they are acting selfishly because while they do care, they care about themselves more.", "Was about to say something similar. By the time I was born in the early 90s my maternal grandmother, two of her siblings and a few of my mom's cousins were diagnosed and treating bipolar... I literally grew up knowing it could be a possibility for me as well.", "It doesn't matter if someone gives a shit or not. If you can't you just cannot. Your boss can fire you, but he can't make you better if your mentally aren't capable. Just as OP can take distance from her parents.

It was highly unprofessional for him to disclose any of your plans to anyone.  It sounds like your parents are agoraphobic. Not that that is an excuse, but they've enabled each other over the years.  You have every right to want your parents at your major life milestones.  If they can't/ won't be there, that's on them not you.  I think you need to stop expecting something from them that they can't or won't give.  It only hurts you.  Live your life for you, your parents can choose to be part of your life or not.

Otherwise, we had to always go to their house for holiday celebrations, sunday lunches, birthdays, etc. My family is perfectly okay with this because we understand how absolutely HARD it is to be a caregiver, especially as a senior. Now, is there times when I wish I could've had a normal childhood and had them there with me?

I\u2019m glad your not my kid. YTA", "NTA, your grandparents can sit in the front instead", "YTA!\nDo you think there condition is a joke?\nI'm pretty sure it won't be something trivial if they had WFH from that time, never attended your school stuff, had no interaction in neighborhood, tried bonding with your person but struggled and are not willing to be in the first row for your wedding.\n\nThere's a major possibility that they're struggling with some sort of mental health issue so you should respect that. They've always been good to you otherwise.\n\nPLEASE INVITE THEM IS NORMAL GUESTS!!!!!", "You seem very resistant to accepting the fact that your parents have very, very severe issues that are probably bona fide mental disorders.  OP, would you agree with this?", "NTA They don't want to be involved, so I don't think you've done anything wrong. If you & your fiance are paying your cousin's boyfriend to perform a service as your wedding organizer he needed to keep his mouth shut ethically speaking. I hope this works out for you & I'm so glad for you that you had your grandparents & aunt's & uncle's to depend on.", "NTA. \n\n1. Ditch the wedding organizer ASAP. Tattling your details to anyone at all is highly inappropriate! Be sure to tell them why they are being replaced. Try to do that nicely but clearly. \n\n2. Whether you choose to invite your childhood babysitters (parents) or not is none of anyone's business. Now that the rude cousin blabbed \"stuff that was none of her business\" all you need to say to anyone asking is, \"They didn't want to leave the house.\" Or \"They chose not to attend.\" Then walk away or ignore them from that point forward.", "I can't say about loving OP, but they definitely neglected OP, and that's just absolutely not OK. They had decades to seek treatment and they must have seen how their antisocial behaviour affects their kid (I also can't imagine that nobody, not even their parents, ever talked to them about it), but apparently it wasn't important enough to them.", "Agree.... They def have mental illness issues. This tactic will not work and it shouldn't be forced on them. Let them come and sit in the back row. They can sneak away during the reception and then you and your bride can go over for a nice celebration dinner after the honeymoon. I hate that people force these tight social \"rules\" on holidays and special occasions.", "I get where your coming from, but how many disappointments that this kid handle? What happens when she has a child? Are they going to be \u201ctoo much\u201d with all their emotions, and get banned too? NTA for OP, but she needs to look at her future too", "While reading your post, it really took me by surprise that you thought they would be capable of *any* of your wedding requests that you made of them.  It makes me wonder if you are in denial about the reality of your parent's situation, almost as if you think they are simply choosing not to go outside of their comfort zone as opposed to them suffering from relatively severe mental disorders.  If so, perhaps you should review and reassess all of this again, but through the lense of viewing your parents as people who suffer from bona fide mental disorders, and then see what your feelings about inviting them are after that.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing with you but wanted to point out, if they couldn\u2019t leave the house for the kids important shit do you really think they were leaving the house to have regular doctors appointments? Or to go have an abortion once they found out they were pregnant? They\u2019ve neglected themselves just as much as they neglected op it\u2019s not like they were just living the good life happy 24/7 just cuz they say they\u2019re more comfortable at home because mentally ill people don\u2019t think like normal people do", "Don't forget the stigma too. And the minimization as well.  Call it wild speculation, but OP attributes it to \"just being anti-social\" rather than a mental illness, as if it's a choice. That plays into it as well.", "OP's a guy", "[deleted]", "Oh my apologies! Missed that. Happy cake day!", "My counter to that would be that, as a recovering alcoholic myself, it took me 6 years of my child\u2019s life to realize I had to get sober. In no way am I condoning my behavior and I applaud you for setting boundaries and not enabling your parents.\n\nMy only reply to this is that I never once didn\u2019t love my son. I get from the outside that it seems very much that alcoholics (or anyone struggling) doesn\u2019t love their kids. But it\u2019s simply not the case. \n\nIn AA they drive it into you that you CANT GET BETTER FOR YOUR LOVED ONES. You HAVE TO GET BETTER FOR YOURSELF. I imagine this is true for anyone with mental/emotional problems.\n\nEither way, I\u2019m sorry you went through that. It gives me relief that I got sober early on in my child\u2019s life", "How do you know they didn't seek help?", "There might well be a translation issue with the term \u201cheaven\u201d. \u201cHaven\u201d might be a closer meaning, or maybe some vague \u201cplace of security\u201d meaning that\u2019s hard to translate.", "I agree in a perfect world but parents are also people and people fuck up. And it's not a bad thing to have grace for someone who screwed up", "That's not helping the issue. As it's still there crutch.", "Perhaps they weren\u2019t like that in the beginning. Perhaps it snowballed into the ease of staying home. Maybe they both had the propensity staying home and instead of one encouraging the other to go out, they supported each other to stay home. Maybe they were busy and family offered to help with OP\u2019s events and that became the norm. The internet has made shopping easy, you can get groceries delivered, Zoom doctor\u2019s visits, and business meetings. Really, you don\u2019t have to leave the house. So if you are anti-social, anxious, and agoraphobic this is a perfect time to be alive!", "Yes, in the US, insurance companies could exclude all mental health care from any coverage until 2008. There was national legislation to get it included. It was incredibly expensive and difficult to get any kind of care before that.", "How did your grandparents treat them for being like that? Did they treat them badly? If they did that could also explain why they are uncomfortable being around people.", "Even if you have panic attacks, you can take medication for this one very important event. There's just no excuse here.", "I mean, if they are neurodivergent, that would have a perfectly good way to live, until they dragged a child into it.", "Good point", "Honestly, OP should have just cut them out ages ago. I don't think they'd miss OP at all at this point. I mean, they've Missed their child's entire life.", "You\u2019re lucky to be alive.  If they hadn\u2019t met in High School I\u2019m pretty sure neither of them would have gotten married.", "This is how I feel too. I have a lot of issues, but I do my best to put them aside when my kids need me to show up for them. I don't always succeed, but I talk to them about it and explain why. Right now I'm feeling guilty because I just had surgery and what I'd love to do is take them out for the day to a place they want to go, since the weather is gorgeous.  Even though it's the last thing I really should want to be doing atm.", "You realize that they call it heaven because everything else is hell, right?", "It's likely that they just... don't know. To me this sounds like people around them have enabled this behavior and in their mind they probably think they are being reasonable and can't relate to OPs view point at all.\n\nThey need a reality check, their families need to sit them down and hold them accountable, both for the way they treated OP growing up and for not having gotten any help till now.\n\nOP discribing them as \"Anti social\" is already a big indicator that mental health probably hasn't even been suggested as a probable cause.\n\nIt sounds like she's been told \"They are just anti social, that's just how they are.\" His whole life really.\n\nEdit: Used the wrong pronoun for Op by accident"]}
