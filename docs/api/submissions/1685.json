I understand your anger, because in those moments they weren't there, but I see that your parents have some issues.\n\nTheir being anti-social, as you describe it, is borderline with hikikomori and this is a condition that cannot be overcome suddenly and probably for them, being the center of attention for such an important event, is one great stress.", "NAH.

NAH\n\n\nInfo: have your parents always been natural born introverts, or did they experience a traumatic event that made them withdraw like that?", "NTA. Your parents have serious issues, but they never addressed them to your detriment. It sounds like they enable each other. I find it fishy about the seating they want to do. Your family knows who they are, it's not like they won't be approached in person. Their anxiety is getting in the way of logic. \n\nIf you want, see if you can livestream the service. Send them some videos of the reception. I wouldn't have them there in person. They may end up with severe panic attacks due to their phobias.\n\nOut of curiosity, did they keep a clean house, or were they hoarders?", "YTA- I get wanting them to participate but it sounds like it\u2019s a huge step for them to even be there. I personally deal with anxiety/PTSD in big crowds and while I can push it off for awhile, eventually I have to step away to collect myself. This would be exacerbated by being shoved into the spotlight. Especially when they couldn\u2019t quietly step away if needed. I would push myself to do what you\u2019re demanding but it would come at high cost to my mental health and I\u2019d be stressed and paying for it for days if it was me. It sounds like they\u2019re trying and you\u2019re not satisfied. Meet them halfway.", "Small YTA. I have crippling anxiety. Your parents obviously do as well and you're forcing them into an incredibly uncomfortable situation", "NTA but first fire your organizer extremely unprofessional", "NTA. either your parents are massive self absorbed ahole that just dont like people or have serious problems. But honestly if you parents have such issues doing anything i'm sorry but they shouldn't have had children in the first place because they frankly seem incapable of the basic things required to be a parent. As you have said your parents were never really there for you so yeah if i was in your shoes i wouldn't invited them because just like the rest of your life they have never been willing to do anything for you.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t invite them if they are too antisocial for you it\u2019s your wedding you can invite who you want to be there. If that means they don\u2019t make the cut so be it.", "YTA , they have social anxiety so crippling that they can't even function normally in society and you've known it for years, you're a doctor, you could have pushed them to seek treatment waaay before now, instead you're trying to force them to do something that's their worst nightmare and instead of letting them sit where they could comfortably manage their disorder you start issuing this ultimatum.", "NTA but your organiser breached your trust in a major way. How are you not angry about that?", "Absolutely NTA. Get a new planner, and congrats on your wedding.", "OP has an uncanny parallel life except it's just my mother who has developed a reclusive personality, and wedding is not imminent (but will happen). I haven't been on a holiday with parents for years, and her last time outside 5km radius was a few months ago but mostly in a car and to take a different member of family back home. My comment will swing and look at it from both sides, it should take you on a rollercoaster before my solution/verdict. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople saying if you have problems you shouldn't be a parent, I think my mum's mental health declined after some time in the parenthood, she wasn't troubled before and she took child rearing seriously - infact too seriously so I think her tensed mentality made her unravel among culture shock and tonnes of things wearing her down. + cultural stigma means she wont accept it,  she struggles to find a therapist that connects with her without huge cultural and experience gaps. She's a great mom - weave had a lot of problems, but it comes from the best place from her and even with our friction she is my mum.\n\nMy mum likely wouldn't want to be at my wedding she wont want the attentions etc, so she has set up her boundaries (just because your are a mum doesn't mean you cant have boundaries and refuse to make a speech if she wouldn't do it for anyone else). I could have read parts wrong so correct me, but your parents said they will join as long as they are not at the front... and they still attended parents evenings albeit online/ phone.. aka they still spent time with you, just working around their boundaries. and they were willing to witness the wedding and be there at an important ceremony.. they took the compromise, so what's the fuss. There is a huge emphasis that you are an asshole if you do not conform to arbitrary societal normal like straight out of an American sitcom, we are allowed to have quirky unresolved patterns (as long as it's not like drinking etc where it revolves into straight up neglect/ abuse). Too many people here on AITA would look at my phobia of fire and say oh you won't go to an event with your future kid because fire terrifies you, you are a monster for not resolving it, we can let people have their seemingly arbitrary fears and ways because at this rate anyone so much as scares of a spider is broken and is an asshole for not going to therapy.\n\nThere is a lot of people here assuming too my parents (by my uncannily similar life to OP) that the parents are horrible people when really they have flaws and we should accept people and their quirkiness. But do tell me if I have read something totally wrong and it isn't the case and the parents just really don't care. Lot of people here underqualified and never experienced what OP has, so my verdict is NSEAUH Need Some Empathy and Understanding Here. Too may people see anything out of a ''normal wedding format' as worse than Mussolini when really there are very few straight up normal families, we all have quirky members of the family and we love them they way they are despite them embarrassing you once in a while.  We are different people, some are social butterflies and others are less sociable but amazing in their nice quirks and hobbies and everything in-between and they all deserve love - unless you are a racist or entitled. Will add, as I'm still confused with what's going on, they must make some contribution to the wedding for them to not be an asshole, even if they view the wedding 400 meters through binoculars if that's what you both agree during a sit down. (ridiculous analogy but you get the sentiment - they need to work with you). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdits: Clarifications and sp", "NAH/YTA, they seem to really struggle and even attending a wedding sounds like it would cause them distress. \n\nThey are trying to compromise, it sounds like you have built up resentment for a lifetime, which is understandable. As a child you deserved parents who could engage and support you in a way you wanted. However, parents are han and did the best they could within their abilities. \nSome parents don't engage in parents of the groom traditions due to simple shyness and it sounds like there's a lot more going on with your parents.  We generally don't want to make those we love to do things that'll distress them.", "YTA. If they're that anti-social you should be glad they're willing to attend at all.", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to have all the feelings you do. But they clearly have mental health issues. And they still wanna make the effort to be there and support you. Give how they rarely can force themselves to do that it should have been enough. But asking for speeches and such was greedy and honestly confusing since you\u2019ve known them your whole life. If you want your parents to be other people you are shit outta luck. But if you want them at your wedding give them an invite and let them come to see to ceremony. It\u2019s the actual important part. The dinner and speeches and cake and dancing isn\u2019t the part that matters at all.", "NAH. I say that assuming you have no concept of what groups of people do to your parents emotional wellbeing. They dont want to be like that, but thats the hand they were dealt. Social anxiety at the level your parents have it means that they cannot cope. They want to be there. They love you. But they want to just sneak in the back and remain as unnoticed as possible. Why are you trying to force them to suffer? It's kind of cruel on your part. I don't think you understand what you're asking. To come at all requires huge bravery on their part. Why can't you accept that gift of love?", "N AH No one chooses mental illness, these parents have a serious problem. They seem to have done their best as long as it doesn\u2019t involve gatherings and distance from home.  I feel terrible for OP and I completely understand his frustration. He and his parents need help to move forward.", "Yes, this is the key takeaway. This wedding planner unnecessarily caused a huge family drama with their unprofessional and indiscrete behavior. \n\nOP, is this just someone informally helping out with planning as a friend, or are you paying this person, a professional wedding planner, for services rendered? Because if it's the latter, this shit is absolutely unacceptable. If the former, they're still an asshole too, but if this is a supposed professional, this is bonkers. It's like if your bank teller called your mom to gossip about how you're opening a new account, or if your career coach reached out to your family to make sure they know you're considering an out-of-state move for work.", "yeah I\u2019m in this boat I think. \n\nif anyone is the real arsehole here it was the wedding organiser. he shouldn\u2019t have told everyone like that, it was a really shitty thing to do. to try and get some sort of jury judgment on your decision for your own wedding\n\nOP, I can absolutely understand why you\u2019re upset, I hope you\u2019re able to get to a place where you can invite them as guests; but they already uninvited themselves from most of your life, so I do understand if this is just where things are at for you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the arsehole. I\u2019m sorry you have gone through so much of this with your parents. I hope you have a beautiful wedding where you are surrounded by people who care about you.", "Nope.

They are TA because they let this get in the way of celebrating their son. I have extreme social anxiety, and have used the 'too people-y' excuse before, but to this extent?

His parents have a lot of issues it sounds like, and they refused to even just sit in the front. Guess what? Weddings are about the people getting married, not their parents. They wouldn't be in the spotlight.\n\nThey never supported their kid before, I feel like they would dip out right after the ceremony. They didn't bother being in his life before, hell they didn't bother getting to know their future son in law. \n\nThis is coming from someone with social anxiety, btw. I can understand not going to a few events because they can't, but they missed graduation and many other milestones.", "I'm an introvert. This is not introversion.", "Her parebts aren't gay, they're neglectful. They value their right to be hermits above their kid. Kids owe such parents nothing.", "It also isn\u2019t unreasonable for parents to seek out mental help so that they can participate more fully in their only child\u2019s life. Did you miss the part where they won\u2019t even get to know the fianc\u00e9? They\u2019ve had 31 years to make changes to improve their mental health so that it wasn\u2019t adversely affecting their only child\u2019s life to the extent they allowed it.", "Given that these parents have essentially never shared anything else in OP's life, including their schooling, why should OP make the effort that they never have?\n\nChoosing not to seek help for a problem - and being unable to support or celebrate your children is a problem - is a choice. I think OP should go forward with the family members who did show up.", "It's a disability. You can't fix autism. And it seemz to be autism.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to assume they don\u2019t love their kids.

I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nice or fair to add insult to injury and suggest to OP that her parents never loved her.", "Also depending on their age/location they may never have had the chance so they created a life they could lead. Yes they could seek help now but realistically even the most successful intervention isn't going to result in them being comfortable enough for his wedding.

You can't get ND person  to be more social than they are", "So deaf and blind people should always get painful or dangerous surgeries so that they can see/hear their childrens partner?\n\nMaybe the parents could have done more (in retrospect most parents could) but the family history and relationship dynamics are not what this post is about.\n\nGiven the situation, is OP in the wrong for not accommodating their parents disability if they wanted their parents at their wedding? I say yes. The way the situation was handled seemed reactionary and over the top.", "Mental health really is a complex thing and understanding this certainly helps to understand people like OP's parents better, but it doesn't immediately absolve them of all their responsibility.\n\nI don't have any problem at all with them being basically agoraphobics at this point, it's fine and they can be so until the end of their lives if that's what makes them truely happy - but the moment they got a child, they would've needed to step up. And maybe they *did* try to, in which case this would actually be a NAH situation (because trying to get better and actually getting better are unfortunately two entirely different things and sometimes the chemicals in your brain will not let you get better, no matter how hard you try), but if they didn't? If they decided \"Nah, this works for us, why get treatment?\" They absolutely would be the assholes. They let their mental health issues come in the way of properly caring for their child and being there for it.\n\nAt that point, they wouldn't have been all too different from someone with untreated depression, alcoholism, whatever - they wouldn't be the assholes for having the issues, they would be the assholes for not treating it. And you can absolutely have empathy and compassion for their issues *while* considering them assholes, mind you.\n\nIn regards to the original question of this thread, it would massively depend on whether they tried to get help or not, but regardless of that, I don't think OP is the asshole in any case. OP obviously suffers from the issues of his parents and when we're talking about being empathic to mental health issues, that should encompass being empathic to the relatives who may suffer from these issues just as much or possibly even more. That's not a one-way street.", "They didnt see teachers in person, didnt attend any of their kids milestones, etc. Thats not neglectful at all? I know plenty of people with autism that go to therapy and learned to cope with it and work around their issues to live a normal productive life. \n\nYeah you might not be able to fix mental health, but the effort needs to be atleast made. They made no effort whatsoever. Just defaulted to the theres to many people around we cant go.

It\u2019s not their fault they have issues but it is their fault that as adults they didn\u2019t take any responsibility for those issues and instead just let their child be traumatized because of it.
