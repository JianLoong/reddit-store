I completely believe that the parents made a very poor decision to not seek help.

So for one day, to spend it with someone who you don't just supposedly love, but bothered to bring into this world, and react this way, is just mind boggling to me.

I would push myself to do what you\u2019re demanding but it would come at high cost to my mental health and I\u2019d be stressed and paying for it for days if it was me.

How are you not angry about that?", "Absolutely NTA. Get a new planner, and congrats on your wedding.", "OP has an uncanny parallel life except it's just my mother who has developed a reclusive personality, and wedding is not imminent (but will happen). I haven't been on a holiday with parents for years, and her last time outside 5km radius was a few months ago but mostly in a car and to take a different member of family back home. My comment will swing and look at it from both sides, it should take you on a rollercoaster before my solution/verdict. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople saying if you have problems you shouldn't be a parent, I think my mum's mental health declined after some time in the parenthood, she wasn't troubled before and she took child rearing seriously - infact too seriously so I think her tensed mentality made her unravel among culture shock and tonnes of things wearing her down. + cultural stigma means she wont accept it,  she struggles to find a therapist that connects with her without huge cultural and experience gaps. She's a great mom - weave had a lot of problems, but it comes from the best place from her and even with our friction she is my mum.\n\nMy mum likely wouldn't want to be at my wedding she wont want the attentions etc, so she has set up her boundaries (just because your are a mum doesn't mean you cant have boundaries and refuse to make a speech if she wouldn't do it for anyone else). I could have read parts wrong so correct me, but your parents said they will join as long as they are not at the front... and they still attended parents evenings albeit online/ phone.. aka they still spent time with you, just working around their boundaries. and they were willing to witness the wedding and be there at an important ceremony.. they took the compromise, so what's the fuss. There is a huge emphasis that you are an asshole if you do not conform to arbitrary societal normal like straight out of an American sitcom, we are allowed to have quirky unresolved patterns (as long as it's not like drinking etc where it revolves into straight up neglect/ abuse). Too many people here on AITA would look at my phobia of fire and say oh you won't go to an event with your future kid because fire terrifies you, you are a monster for not resolving it, we can let people have their seemingly arbitrary fears and ways because at this rate anyone so much as scares of a spider is broken and is an asshole for not going to therapy.\n\nThere is a lot of people here assuming too my parents (by my uncannily similar life to OP) that the parents are horrible people when really they have flaws and we should accept people and their quirkiness. But do tell me if I have read something totally wrong and it isn't the case and the parents just really don't care. Lot of people here underqualified and never experienced what OP has, so my verdict is NSEAUH Need Some Empathy and Understanding Here. Too may people see anything out of a ''normal wedding format' as worse than Mussolini when really there are very few straight up normal families, we all have quirky members of the family and we love them they way they are despite them embarrassing you once in a while.  We are different people, some are social butterflies and others are less sociable but amazing in their nice quirks and hobbies and everything in-between and they all deserve love - unless you are a racist or entitled. Will add, as I'm still confused with what's going on, they must make some contribution to the wedding for them to not be an asshole, even if they view the wedding 400 meters through binoculars if that's what you both agree during a sit down.

Your medical conditions doesn't take away from consequences that effect others. Especially your own children for God's sake..", "They don't love her *enough* to even be at her milestone events. They won't take one step out of their comfort zone to support their daughter. It sounds like they won't even try. She's not important enough to them for them to even *try*", "Him. OP is male.", "It's a lack of love to make no effort whatsoever.", "This definitely doesn\u2019t sound like agoraphobia or OCD. I\u2019ve had both conditions for a long time and this behaviour is not in line with either condition. \n\n\nMost people with agoraphobia also suffer from a panic disorder. They want to leave the house, but get crippling panic attacks in certain public settings. Home tends to be regarded as more of a prison that a heaven by most people I\u2019ve interacted with in the community.\n\n\nOCD is characterised by intrusive thoughts, ritualistic behaviour, or a combination of both. Whilst there\u2019s diverse subtypes of the disorder, all types involve a person feeling distress from their symptoms.\n\n\nOP\u2019s parents seem to be able to enter public settings, they just dislike the social aspect of being in public. They also don\u2019t appear to demonstrate compulsive/ritualistic behaviour or any apparent distress from their isolation, they\u2019re just incredibly asocial. I\u2019m not a psych, but I\u2019d be very surprised if either had agoraphobia or OCD.", "OP is a he", "I agree. I'd bet that the parents really do love OP, but they've just had screwed up priorities, like prioritising their unhealthy avoidance of triggers over their kid's wellbeing.\n\nFor me personally, I know my parents love me, but I know that I'm not a priority over their addictions and mental illnesses. It still sucks ass, but I find it preferable than them totally not giving a shit ever.", "OP is male", "People like that shouldn\u2019t have had children. They could have got help years ago but they instead chose to try to socially isolate their son and neglect him (refusing to go to parents/teacher conferences, school activities, let him establish friends is a form of neglect). There is a lack of love there.", "OP is a man marrying a man", "It's not their fault that they are sick but it's their responsibility to take care of that sicknes, with I don't think they do anything about. I didn't find any mention of them being in therapy or taking meds but maby I just missed it somewhere in comments.", "You cannot control mental illness, but you can control how you respond to it. Refusing to manage it is a problem. They knew they were missing out in OP's life. OP was not enough of a motivation to seek changes or help, though. And that's not the mental illness destroying lives at this point- that's a refusal to manage it.", "Agreed. Who has tried to help them?", "Yes and no. \n\nNote that OP only said \"Anti-Social.\" As in, his parents just don't like being in contact with other people.\n\nAnti-Social Personality Disorder, on the other hand, is often attributed with psychopaths and/or sociopaths, and indicates a complete lack of regard for people other than yourself- which does not seem to be the case with the parents, as hands off as they may be.\n\nOn the other hand, the person you're replying to is definitely misusing the term.", "OP also hasn't said they did.  I hope that OP would have included in their post if the parents had attempted treatment at any point, as that would be relevant information.", "I was referring to these parents specifically, not just Asocial people. Asocial people absolutely can and should have kids IF they are willing to put the effort in to at least try for their kids.OPs parents didn\u2019t try. They pawned him off on everyone else and don\u2019t seem to care how it affected their kid. \n\nTo miss every single important life event for their child is more than just Asocial and bad mental health, it\u2019s bad parenting. If they knew they hated being social this badly, they were selfish as heck to have a child they were going to neglect.", "I didn't say it was \"an excuse\". I was pointing out that almost by definition mental health issues make no logical sense.", "Especially when their behavior negatively affected their child.  They were lucky other family members stepped up.\n\nBut mental health issues are never a shield for doing harm to others.", "last thing you should call someone with a disability is \"abnormal\", you sound like an AH", "This is a really hard place to draw a line about neglect though. If a family was too poor to throw a block party would that be neglect? They didn\u2019t say he couldn\u2019t have friends, they just didn\u2019t have them there. And they communicated with the teachers so they clearly cared, it just wasn\u2019t in person. \n\nObviously they needed therapy, and obviously OP has complicated feelings about it. It wasn\u2019t great parenting but does it meet the standard of neglect?", "OP is a he/him.", "I was going to say, I have OCD and it\u2019s so misunderstood. Thank you for clarifying for people that that is almost certainly not the problem here.", "This is going back 30 years. Mental health and therapy was far less of a thing.", "I'm going to say NAH. You're going to be a doctor, and in your professional life, you're going to meet a lot of people who have mental health problems, and they are going to need you to be compassionate, and knowledgeable.", "This person was born 31 years ago. Therapy was way different and far less available", "Sorry, but that is a nonsense statement, since not all mental health issues are even already present for people to get treatment for BEFORE they have children - in fact for women pregnancy and birth are times in which often mental health issues can become visible that were not there (or at least not identified) before.\n\nIssues like agoraphobia, social anxiety etc also tend to worsen OVER TIME if not treated.\n\nI think given how extreme their condition seems to be - not even having been up to getting to know the fianc\u00e9 - they are already making clearly quite an afford to go to the wedding at all, even if not sitting in the front row. I have worked with many clients who would not even have entered a groceries store, let alone attend an entire wedding event.\n\nI say NAH because OPs disappointment makes sense, and almost all children of parents struggling with mental health issues at one point or another wished that they had parents who did not - but the parents are not AH for struggling either, and we have too few information to know if they have ever attempted to seek treatment or not (or if that was ever even an option for them - in the US at least that is not a given either).", "Hopefully other adults and peers because it absolutely 100% is NEVER on the child if you are trying to imply that OP should have been hand holding his parents through psychiatric treatment.", "Are we really gonna assume op never once asked them to get help in there childhood? Are we being this intellectually dishonest now?", "Most people mean asocial when they say Anti-soical, it's a common mistake.", "It\u2019s not like OP would even necessarily know if they did.", "It would be relevant info, I agree.  Which may be exactly why it\u2019s left out.  Or it could be left out because it didn\u2019t happen.  Hopefully OP clarifies in an edit or comment", "That's why I said I couldn't speak for OP's parents but what Asocial people typically struggle with in terms of socialization. Like I said they can have kids but they're more comfortable with interacting with those they already know, it's just harder to interact with those they don't and will try to avoid it. Doesn't mean they are 100% against it.", "I'm autistic, I get it, but it's not a get out of jail free card to put one's own needs above the needs of others every single time.\n\nOP wants their parents to act like parents at their wedding, they've already compromised saying they don't need to make a speech, all they need to do is sit on the front row which not many are even focused on anyway because the whole focus of the day is the bride and groom.\n\nRefusing to compromise is selfish. Yes it will be uncomfortable for them but it will mean the world to OP. They can have exit routes and coping mechanisms and a quiet space to retreat to. Autism is a struggle, it is not an excuse to be selfish.\n\nAlso saying you can't get a neurodivergent person to be social ingrains a stigma, there are plenty of sociable neurodivergent people.", "That 100% fits the standards of emotional neglect. Children can have all of their physical needs met and still be neglected!", "I think finding help for your mental problems is impossible for some and I don't necessarily fault the parents for not finding the strength to do so. It is too easy to say someone should find help like it is an easy step to take. It doesn't mean they didn't love OP, they simply were unable to.\n\nBut while it is sad they never found the strength to help themselves, it still had consequences on their relationship with OP. Being unable to help yourself doesn't absolve you of that. And if that means OP doesn't want to invite them to their wedding, that is a consequence they have to live with.", "[removed]", "I'm almost 99.9% sure OP meant \"haven\" and didn't know how to spell it.

They very obviously have problems they are refusing to treat. Therapy has gotten quite good and in depth recently and they could start at any time to maybe ay least try to be there for their kids at all? Better late then never.", "If you can't leave the house,  you should not have children.  If you have uncontrolled mental health issues,  you should not have children.  I have way more compassion for neglected children than adults who inflict their issues on innocents.  Mental health is not an excuse to not parent your child.

You don't have to see or hear someone to get to know them.

The surgeries have serious risk factors up until death...\n\nThat's the only reason they will not be done. If these surgeries had the same risk factors as therapy which is essential none except simply not working. Then yes.

How are we going to handle friends? School activities? Graduations?\" I just don't understand their line of thought on that. What were their expectations?

Then, I started picturing a little kid tugging on my hand, asking me to go outside, telling me about their upcoming school play or soccer match...I have my issues too but seeing their disappointment/sadness would hurt too much. I know we're getting only one side of the story but man, how do you sit back and watch your kid go through life and not have some urge to see what they're accomplishing/living outside your walls?

This isn't just \"dead people traditions\" as this clearly matters to OP and it's the parents final last opportunity to make them feel cared for at a significant life event.\n\nThey've prioritised their needs over OPs needs throughout their entire life, this is one last significant event for them to show up and show OP they care.", "The fact that they literally missed every single milestone shows that they didn't try.
