I completely believe that the parents made a very poor decision to not seek help. However, I also cannot label them as 100% AH, no matter how selfish they might have been, simply because mental health problems are so complex and difficult to deal with.

So for one day, to spend it with someone who you don't just supposedly love, but bothered to bring into this world, and react this way, is just mind boggling to me.

Your parents have serious issues, but they never addressed them to your detriment. It sounds like they enable each other. I find it fishy about the seating they want to do. Your family knows who they are, it's not like they won't be approached in person. Their anxiety is getting in the way of logic. \n\nIf you want, see if you can livestream the service.

They may end up with severe panic attacks due to their phobias.\n\nOut of curiosity, did they keep a clean house, or were they hoarders?", "YTA- I get wanting them to participate but it sounds like it\u2019s a huge step for them to even be there. I personally deal with anxiety/PTSD in big crowds and while I can push it off for awhile, eventually I have to step away to collect myself.

I would push myself to do what you\u2019re demanding but it would come at high cost to my mental health and I\u2019d be stressed and paying for it for days if it was me.

How are you not angry about that?", "Absolutely NTA. Get a new planner, and congrats on your wedding.", "OP has an uncanny parallel life except it's just my mother who has developed a reclusive personality, and wedding is not imminent (but will happen). I haven't been on a holiday with parents for years, and her last time outside 5km radius was a few months ago but mostly in a car and to take a different member of family back home. My comment will swing and look at it from both sides, it should take you on a rollercoaster before my solution/verdict. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople saying if you have problems you shouldn't be a parent, I think my mum's mental health declined after some time in the parenthood, she wasn't troubled before and she took child rearing seriously - infact too seriously so I think her tensed mentality made her unravel among culture shock and tonnes of things wearing her down. + cultural stigma means she wont accept it,  she struggles to find a therapist that connects with her without huge cultural and experience gaps. She's a great mom - weave had a lot of problems, but it comes from the best place from her and even with our friction she is my mum.\n\nMy mum likely wouldn't want to be at my wedding she wont want the attentions etc, so she has set up her boundaries (just because your are a mum doesn't mean you cant have boundaries and refuse to make a speech if she wouldn't do it for anyone else). I could have read parts wrong so correct me, but your parents said they will join as long as they are not at the front... and they still attended parents evenings albeit online/ phone.. aka they still spent time with you, just working around their boundaries. and they were willing to witness the wedding and be there at an important ceremony.. they took the compromise, so what's the fuss. There is a huge emphasis that you are an asshole if you do not conform to arbitrary societal normal like straight out of an American sitcom, we are allowed to have quirky unresolved patterns (as long as it's not like drinking etc where it revolves into straight up neglect/ abuse). Too many people here on AITA would look at my phobia of fire and say oh you won't go to an event with your future kid because fire terrifies you, you are a monster for not resolving it, we can let people have their seemingly arbitrary fears and ways because at this rate anyone so much as scares of a spider is broken and is an asshole for not going to therapy.\n\nThere is a lot of people here assuming too my parents (by my uncannily similar life to OP) that the parents are horrible people when really they have flaws and we should accept people and their quirkiness. But do tell me if I have read something totally wrong and it isn't the case and the parents just really don't care. Lot of people here underqualified and never experienced what OP has, so my verdict is NSEAUH Need Some Empathy and Understanding Here. Too may people see anything out of a ''normal wedding format' as worse than Mussolini when really there are very few straight up normal families, we all have quirky members of the family and we love them they way they are despite them embarrassing you once in a while.  We are different people, some are social butterflies and others are less sociable but amazing in their nice quirks and hobbies and everything in-between and they all deserve love - unless you are a racist or entitled. Will add, as I'm still confused with what's going on, they must make some contribution to the wedding for them to not be an asshole, even if they view the wedding 400 meters through binoculars if that's what you both agree during a sit down.
