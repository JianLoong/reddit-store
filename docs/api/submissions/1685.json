People will pay more attention to them if they find out that those are your parents, and they want to hide in the back row and dip out ASAP. It probably won't be anything more than a \"huh. That sure is odd\" comment, but it'll certainly be much less attention than \"those must be her parents.\"\n\n2.) It's YOUR wedding. People won't be looking at your parents nearly as much as they will you. It's odd that they're concerned about \"being the attention\" when you're going to be up on an altar, and they'll be in the crowd. \n\nThat being said, I'd still drop them the invite, let them exist in the space as they please, and dip out. Having severe social anxiety is one thing, but it sounds like they can barely see the forest through the trees.", "NTA. \nSurprised you\u2019ve continued to try to have a relationship with them ( I understand though I know how hard it can be) \n\nIf they don\u2019t wish to participate in the way you want them to, they don\u2019t need to be there.\n\nWish you and your partner the best of luck and a happy life together \u2764\ufe0f", "Are they agoraphobic, have anti-social personality or simply don't care to invest in having a healthy relationship with you?

So I will just suggest that given you know their significant limits perhaps pushing them to go further than they are capable of going is just going to be a situation where you are constantly upset and hurt. Younger you deserved better. Adult you may need to accept that your parents have some sort of mental hygiene issue that is going to prevent you from having a traditional relationship with them. Either way it stinks for you.", "NTA  \n\n\nIts your wedding, if you don't want to invite them then don't. It doesn't seem like they put any effort into being parents, at least besides the basics of feeding and putting a roof over your head when you were younger. If they don't want to put in effort to be there, then you don't have to invite them. It's your day, you do what you want to do and fuck anyone else.", "I'm going to say NAH. You're going to be a doctor, and in your professional life, you're going to meet a lot of people who have mental health problems, and they are going to need you to be compassionate, and knowledgeable. You can practice your skills with your parents. They are mentally ill.\n\nAnd unless they are violent, or harm others, they are *not* anti-social. They are unsociable. There is an important distinction. And they can't just shake it off.\n\nIt's hard for you, because their illness has cost you in very serious ways. You can be detached when it's your patient, but it's harder when it's your mom and dad. But I think you should work with their limits. People who have managed to work at home long before the pandemic must feel their need for isolation in a very profound way.", "NAH\n\nI fully understand your point of view, because it's normal to want parents close and proactive for your wedding and for the most important moments of your life. I understand your anger, because in those moments they weren't there, but I see that your parents have some issues.\n\nTheir being anti-social, as you describe it, is borderline with hikikomori and this is a condition that cannot be overcome suddenly and probably for them, being the center of attention for such an important event, is one great stress.", "NAH. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but this seems more medical than it does a lack of desire to be in your life?? If I\u2019m wrong, then N T A because they chose to do this to themselves.\n\nIf I\u2019m right and it is more of a medical/mental issue, they might be doing the best they can. From what it sounds like, just going to the wedding as regular guests would be an incredible feat for them.\n\nBut it\u2019s also understandable that you feel unsupported or abandoned by them and just want them to act like \u201cnormal\u201d parents who are excited for these things and therefore want to be involved in all aspects of your life.", "NTA If they knew they had these problems, why did they have a child(ren)? Things such as this happen in your life when you have kids. You obviously had to do social things in life even when it was uncomfortable for you. Going to a family members funeral to show support for your loved ones, because their pain means more to you than some family members you just can't stand; needing to sign your child up for school, because education is required; having to go to school yourself, and the experience of all that; having to get a job, and going to interviews; groceries (or stuff for gardening if you have a garden) because you need to live and survive, paying bills, the list goes on. So for one day, to spend it with someone who you don't just supposedly love, but bothered to bring into this world, and react this way, is just mind boggling to me.

But.. with whatever social disorder they have, and I'm sure you are tired of being understanding, but perhaps understanding one last time and not taking it personally, (hard to do, I'm sure) is the thing to do. You do not want to look back at this significant moment in your life and have it tainted by bitterness or regret. And is this really how YOU feel, or has someone else in your life perhaps influenced or projected their feelings about it onto you?", "NTA, One or both of them clearly have mental health issues.  You and your husband shouldn't feel burdened by them on what will be your most important day together.  It's your party.

If it wasn't for other  family members stepping up..You wouldn't have had a life.", "You need new wedding organizer. Loose lips sink ships.", "It sounds like they don't want to be in anyone's life. Being there means showing up. Literally. Having virtual parents doesn't sound very fulfilling. Nta", "Why can't you just appreciate that they are uncomfortable in the spotlight and allow them to attend and support as they are best able to -- sitting in the back if that's what works.  Did you honestly think they would give a speech?????  C'mon!!  You cannot make them be who they are not.  And honestly, why do you need to?  Can't just just appreciate their presence and support?  You seem very immature and without empathy.    Hope you are nicer to your patients with medical/mental health issues.", "YTA - It sounds like they have a pretty sever disorder and they can not force themselves into situations that most people would see as normal. Its pretty inconsiderate to try to tell them \"be normal or don't be there\".

They can't help their disability, but from your post, it doesn't sound like they've taken any steps toward getting treatment. That's the tipping point for me: you can be compassionate about a mental health issue, but it's not a blanket free pass. You get to have feelings too because it impacts you as well, in a very direct sense. You're allowed to feel upset about the absences because they're *your parents* \\- that hurts. I'm so sorry that happened to you.   \n\n\nTwo things to think about:   \n1. Your grandparents did a lot of heavy lifting for your parents so that you could have as normal a childhood as possible - would it be possible to place them in the spot of honor reserved for the parents at your ceremony and reception? Even if you don't call attention to it with a strobe light and backhanded announcement, it might be nice to give them that place of honor for all they've done.  \n2.
