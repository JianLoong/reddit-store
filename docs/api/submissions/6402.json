{"id": 6402, "submission_id": "102fde1", "title": "AITA for eating near my coworker who has autism?", "selftext": "So at the store I work at, we just hired a girl (we'll call her Anna) about a month ago. So far she's done nothing but sit in our breakroom and work through the absolute monstrosity that is our onboarding/training. She still has about a week or two left in it as well so she's temporarily stuck in the back all day. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, my manager pulled me aside and told me that Anna had complained about me. She said Anna told her the crinkling of my bag of chips I was eating in the breakroom was distracting her, and since she's autistic, she can't have distractions like that otherwise she won't get anything done that she needs to. She also requested that we all stay out of the breakroom while she's in there so she can focus. My manager told her that she would mention it to me, but that she won't make the break room off limits so she can concentrate. She also told her that in the future, she would prefer if we talked it out ourselves and not involve her in issues we may have with each other. So she brought it up with me and just told me to keep it in mind if I choose to go back there. \n\nSo the other day, I went back and I could tell immediately that Anna was upset. She glared at me the minute I walked into the room, and she kept huffing and puffing every time she heard my footsteps. Our breakroom is fairly large, and I was on the opposite side of it, but I'm assuming based on her actions she still could hear me. I spent all of maybe 10 minutes back there, but at that point I felt too bad to stay because I didnt want to disrupt her. It started to get on my nerves a bit as well. \n\nThis went on for a few days, until finally the day before yesterday I confronted her about it. I apologized for bothering her but told her that I would continue coming back here if I needed to, and if I ever get too loud to just let me know instead of glaring at me in silence. I let her know that this space is for all employees, and while we can definitely try to be quiet, sometimes noises happen. She got all sulky and basically just said she wouldnt be made to feel bad about her autism. She didn't say anything else, but any time she saw me over the next two days, she refused to say anything. Just glared at me. \n\nI'm really not sure where to go from here. Part of me feels terrible because I don't know how difficult it is to have autism and enter a new job where you dont know anyone. But part of me is also very annoyed, because Anna is a grown woman older than I am and has had many jobs in the past similar to the one we have now. Everyone I've talked go about this, including my best friend who also has autism, has told me I handled the situation about as well as I possibly could have. But i still feel guilty, at least somewhat. \n\nSo reddit, aita?", "created_utc": 1672770383, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102fde1/aita_for_eating_near_my_coworker_who_has_autism/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Autism can be all about one rule applies to all and its all very literal.\n\nExplaining to them eating is a normal thing to do in an eating area where everyone does this here. If they are feeling over stimulated by this they need to find a place to accommodate their own disabilities as a communal area as its not just for them.\nI'm all for work place accommodations for those with disabilities but some of it has to be they need to do on their own not everyone move out of the way for them kind of thing.", "NTA.

I'm sensitive to noise myself, and it makes it tough for me to concentrate. (I wonder if Anna has tried things like noise-canceling headphones to block out noise.) So I get where she is coming from. But she's certainly not entitled to monopolize the breakroom.\n\nIf anyone here is the asshole, it's management for not coming up with better accommodations for her.", "NTA, but neither is Anna. Your boss sucks though; not only are they doing a terrible job of accommodating Anna's needs, but they're also outright *refusing* to do their own job (i.e. managing staff), by telling you to sort this out between yourselves. This puts both you and Anna in a shitty position when neither of you are to blame.", "NTA. She can remove herself whenever she wants.

While yes, sensory things like someone eating nearby can be very distracting, that doesn't give her the right to be the only person allowed to use the break room.

The rest of the world does not stop for your issues or disability. That sounds harsh, but it's true.\n\nIt's not everyone else's job to make the break room appropriate for Anna due to her autism, it's Anna's job to find a way to make the break room tolerable for her (headphones, asking to train in another room, asking to do onboarding at home).\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Your manager should provide proper accommodations for Anna since this is considered a psychological disability. I say this as someone who has the same issue with people making noise when I\u2019m working, and had a documented psychological disability with my university when I was a student because I had to take exams in a separate rooms. That\u2019s something Anna and your manager should be working out, not you.", "NTA. The break room is for taking breaks and eating, not studying and training. She needs to be moved somewhere else that's quiet. Surely you aren't the only person who needs the break room for actual breaks.", "NTA. FWIW, I'm autistic and have sensory issues. It's not your responsibility to accommodate her sensory issues, it's the manager's. And if the break room is too noisy/distracting to focus, she should be provided a space that isn't. A break room isn't an appropriate space to expect someone to focus on work. If the only issue is the noise, she could use ear plugs, noise canceling headphones/earbuds, etc. Assuming she doesn't need to be listening to someone talk to her, there are hundreds of options she could use to accommodate herself.  \n\nYou didn't do anything to make her feel bad about her autism, she made you feel bad about using the break room for it's intended purpose. IDK if talking to your manager will do anybody any good, but it's up to them to provide suitable space for Anna to work, and it's up to Anna to accommodate herself as much as is reasonable.  \n\nIt's also worth noting, despite Anna being older and having previous work experience, she might not realize on who's responsible for what regarding her accommodations. Being expected to work in a break room for over a month is not at all normal. Autistic people sometimes don't know how to deal with new situations properly.  \n\nAutistic people also often don't express emotions the same way non-autistic people do. Her \"glaring\" might not be glaring at all, it might just be her neutral facial expression. (Especially autistic women are often read as being \"stuck up\" or \"angry\" when they're just not putting on an expression for other people's benefit.) If she doesn't realize she's being read as pissed off, and you're talking to her as if she is, it might explain why she seems to think you're coming off as trying to make her feel bad. Don't assume her mood based on her facial expression. This is the only thing you're doing wrong, but it's not like you're being rude/AH-ish, just *potentially* making a wrong assumption.", "NTA she is weaponizing her autism and making everyone cater to it in a shared space.

Please try to not alienate your coworker because of this. I imagine that she wants to do the training well and when there is a distraction internally she is like \"oh god oh god I will not complete this training, I need to focus, I need to focus\" and obviously cannot focus and very quickly stops thinking rationally. This is what happens to me anyway.\n\nOn top of this, it is very difficult to make friends and navigate new social situations. Please just assume that she wants to do a good job and has nothing against you personally.\n\nIf you do talk to her about this, please try to find a moment outside of when she is trying to do the training (definitely not when she is upset).\n\nAutistic people respond well to routine, so if you were to propose something like \"I will always come at quarter past and spend 10 minutes in the break room\" or \"How about we eat together at XX time and you take a break from your training then\" she might respond better to something like this.
