{"id": 6402, "submission_id": "102fde1", "title": "AITA for eating near my coworker who has autism?", "selftext": "So at the store I work at, we just hired a girl (we'll call her Anna) about a month ago. So far she's done nothing but sit in our breakroom and work through the absolute monstrosity that is our onboarding/training. She still has about a week or two left in it as well so she's temporarily stuck in the back all day. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, my manager pulled me aside and told me that Anna had complained about me. She said Anna told her the crinkling of my bag of chips I was eating in the breakroom was distracting her, and since she's autistic, she can't have distractions like that otherwise she won't get anything done that she needs to. She also requested that we all stay out of the breakroom while she's in there so she can focus. My manager told her that she would mention it to me, but that she won't make the break room off limits so she can concentrate. She also told her that in the future, she would prefer if we talked it out ourselves and not involve her in issues we may have with each other. So she brought it up with me and just told me to keep it in mind if I choose to go back there. \n\nSo the other day, I went back and I could tell immediately that Anna was upset. She glared at me the minute I walked into the room, and she kept huffing and puffing every time she heard my footsteps. Our breakroom is fairly large, and I was on the opposite side of it, but I'm assuming based on her actions she still could hear me. I spent all of maybe 10 minutes back there, but at that point I felt too bad to stay because I didnt want to disrupt her. It started to get on my nerves a bit as well. \n\nThis went on for a few days, until finally the day before yesterday I confronted her about it. I apologized for bothering her but told her that I would continue coming back here if I needed to, and if I ever get too loud to just let me know instead of glaring at me in silence. I let her know that this space is for all employees, and while we can definitely try to be quiet, sometimes noises happen. She got all sulky and basically just said she wouldnt be made to feel bad about her autism. She didn't say anything else, but any time she saw me over the next two days, she refused to say anything. Just glared at me. \n\nI'm really not sure where to go from here. Part of me feels terrible because I don't know how difficult it is to have autism and enter a new job where you dont know anyone. But part of me is also very annoyed, because Anna is a grown woman older than I am and has had many jobs in the past similar to the one we have now. Everyone I've talked go about this, including my best friend who also has autism, has told me I handled the situation about as well as I possibly could have. But i still feel guilty, at least somewhat. \n\nSo reddit, aita?", "created_utc": 1672770383, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102fde1/aita_for_eating_near_my_coworker_who_has_autism/", "score": 835, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Autism can be all about one rule applies to all and its all very literal.\n\nExplaining to them eating is a normal thing to do in an eating area where everyone does this here. If they are feeling over stimulated by this they need to find a place to accommodate their own disabilities as a communal area as its not just for them.\nI'm all for work place accommodations for those with disabilities but some of it has to be they need to do on their own not everyone move out of the way for them kind of thing.", "NTA.

The rest of the world does not stop for your issues or disability. That sounds harsh, but it's true.\n\nIt's not everyone else's job to make the break room appropriate for Anna due to her autism, it's Anna's job to find a way to make the break room tolerable for her (headphones, asking to train in another room, asking to do onboarding at home).\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Your manager should provide proper accommodations for Anna since this is considered a psychological disability. I say this as someone who has the same issue with people making noise when I\u2019m working, and had a documented psychological disability with my university when I was a student because I had to take exams in a separate rooms. That\u2019s something Anna and your manager should be working out, not you.", "NTA. The break room is for taking breaks and eating, not studying and training. She needs to be moved somewhere else that's quiet. Surely you aren't the only person who needs the break room for actual breaks.", "NTA. FWIW, I'm autistic and have sensory issues. It's not your responsibility to accommodate her sensory issues, it's the manager's. And if the break room is too noisy/distracting to focus, she should be provided a space that isn't. A break room isn't an appropriate space to expect someone to focus on work. If the only issue is the noise, she could use ear plugs, noise canceling headphones/earbuds, etc. Assuming she doesn't need to be listening to someone talk to her, there are hundreds of options she could use to accommodate herself.  \n\nYou didn't do anything to make her feel bad about her autism, she made you feel bad about using the break room for it's intended purpose. IDK if talking to your manager will do anybody any good, but it's up to them to provide suitable space for Anna to work, and it's up to Anna to accommodate herself as much as is reasonable.  \n\nIt's also worth noting, despite Anna being older and having previous work experience, she might not realize on who's responsible for what regarding her accommodations. Being expected to work in a break room for over a month is not at all normal. Autistic people sometimes don't know how to deal with new situations properly.  \n\nAutistic people also often don't express emotions the same way non-autistic people do. Her \"glaring\" might not be glaring at all, it might just be her neutral facial expression. (Especially autistic women are often read as being \"stuck up\" or \"angry\" when they're just not putting on an expression for other people's benefit.) If she doesn't realize she's being read as pissed off, and you're talking to her as if she is, it might explain why she seems to think you're coming off as trying to make her feel bad. Don't assume her mood based on her facial expression.

Please try to not alienate your coworker because of this. I imagine that she wants to do the training well and when there is a distraction internally she is like \"oh god oh god I will not complete this training, I need to focus, I need to focus\" and obviously cannot focus and very quickly stops thinking rationally. This is what happens to me anyway.\n\nOn top of this, it is very difficult to make friends and navigate new social situations.

However, what the able-bodied employee doesn't realize is that the employee in the wheelchair also has shoulder issues that preclude them from raising their arm above their shoulder.\n\nThe book clearly needs to be kept on a lower shelf so the employee with the wheelchair can reach it.

Would you mind putting it on a lower one?\"?\n\nOr let's say the able-bodied employee does know the wheelchair user can't reach the higher shelf and one time absent-mindedly puts the book out of reach. Should the boss get involved? You could argue that yes, technically it's the boss' responsibility, but assuming it wasn't done maliciously and isn't a pattern of behavior, all parties (both employees and the boss) are likely better served by the person in the wheelchair making a simple request.\n\nIn either of these situations can the wheelchair user ask the boss to have the conversation? Sure, and if it's repeated/malicious behavior or if it's a systemic change that needs to be made (i.e. 20 people spread across 3 departments and 2 shifts use the book, and it's not practicable for the employee to run around making requests), that's almost certainly the best approach.\n\nBut if it's not malicious, repeated, or systemic, the boss' involvement is likely to sour the relationship between the employees to some degree and would typically be better handled on a peer level.", "You're right, there isnt any other option.

Wouldn't kill them to be polite about it, but every autistic person is different, and many struggle socially, which is why I don't want to assume they're just being Rude from the information we're given. Benefit of the doubt does not mean \"autistic people can do no wrong,\" just, y'know. Nuance. Not black & white, etc etc.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA. I have sensory quirks around others eating. I once had a co worker who sat next to me (an elderly man) who would make a full bowl of cereal in the morning and slurped it so sloppily and loudly it was insane. It was like a physical stabbing pain in my ears and caused indescribable fury, you know what I did? I not so subtly took my work out into the corridor until he was done. \n\nYour manager fucked up putting her employee in the break room where people eat and there are smells and noises. Even for normal people that would be insufferable and irritating. The new girl had a right to complain but not to take it out on you and manager needs to fix this problem and put the new girl in an area that\u2019s more appropriate. I hope the new girl goes higher and stops focusing on you who is the innocent party here.", "Why did management stick her in the breakroom? That\u2019s not a good place to get work done at all. Your manager is more the AH than anyone else, so I\u2019m going to say NTA.", "Where\u2019s HR? Employees have the right to a breakroom and Anna has a right to accommodation! Manager needs to provide this.", "Why is she not able to complete the training at home? Or have sound proof headphones? Where are any kind  accommodations for her that don\u2019t put her at odds with the rest of the staff? NTA but I don\u2019t think she is either", "NTA.\n\nAnna needs to manage her own sensitivities, there are noise cancelling headphones if she needs them, the break room is where people are supposed to take their breaks, her autism doesn't make her queen of the world. You were mature enough to talk to her and apologize and she's acting like a sulky toddler.", "That\u2019s one weird store. I got about an hour\u2019s training on how to operate the computerized point of sale system, then I went to work operating the register, with an experienced employee doing in-the-job training. Most stores can\u2019t afford a month\u2019s salary when the employee might be  unsuited to the job.", "All I want to know is, what kind of store requires 5/6 weeks of training? Not to be rude. I\u2019ve worked in retail 20+ years mostly management and I\u2019ve never had that much training at induction.", "NTA but your manager needs to provide another communal space or get that other employee headphones. It\u2019s not up to you to sort it out. They didn\u2019t quite provide enough accommodations, or perhaps they set the other new employees expectation too high as to what could be reasonably expected. They need to fix it. That\u2019s their whole role, they manage.", "NTA, it's the breakroom.  Your employer should find another place or way to accommodate her.", "NTA. If she can't handle this much noise then she needs to be provided ear plugs by management, not expect the people around her to cease to exist.", "Definitely NTA", "NTA \n\nThis is a workplace. People come and go! And eat food!!!!!\n\nShe needs a different job or different place of work if her issue is people around her!", "As someone who struggles with misophonia, specifically triggered by people in the same or adjacent room eating chips, I mean this as gently as possible when I say that you are not the problem and she isn\u2019t entirely either. I wish I could talk to your coworker and tell her some of my coping strategies (moving to a different space, listening to music, eating simultaneously, wearing noise cancelling earplugs) but I don\u2019t know her. I hope she\u2019s able to get access to some accommodations because I completely understand the huffiness. However, it isn\u2019t fair for her to direct it at you and in a work place where one can be expected to face sensory triggers she should be creating coping mechanisms with y\u2019all\u2019s boss instead of complaining about those triggers. She can\u2019t control how irritating your chips are, but she can control how she reacts.", "NTA. If she can\u2019t handle noise & distractions she needs to find a new job.", "NTA. A manager's job is to find a place for newbies to train that doesn't inconvenience everybody else that's working. \n\nAlso, I gotta ask - what job is she going to do where she'll have no distractions? If a chip bag throws her off, most jobs would be utter chaos.", "NTA - tell her to get some Loop earbuds.", "NTA, you have a horrible manager.", "NTA. I'm autistic, and one of the things that I realize is that if I'm going to be around other people, I'm going to have to deal with them doing things like eating and making other small noises that annoy me, while the noises are perfectly fine to everyone else. That's just life.", "This! Also...even if she's distracted for a few minutes, so what? When I did employee training in the break room I wasted time screwing around some of the time, so did everyone else, most employees are not productive 100% of the time. Plus most break room training is just dumb videos explaining stuff everyone already knows. If it's a real problem they should have another area she can do it in. We sometimes used the manager's office or cash office for the computer training (that was soooo boring). NTA", "Yes! Even just regular earplugs, headphones  or earbuds help a bit if she doesn't have noise cancelling ones.\n\nBut also noise canceling headphones are amazing and a useful accessibility tool for anyone with hearing sensitivity or who are easily distracted.", "Employee: \\*uses autism\\*\n\nu/ATrueGmr: no u\n\nManager: \ud83e\udd2f", "My 30+ nephew is autistic and would NEVER act that way!", "That's what it sounds like to me too. They should move her to a quieter place and not require everyone else to change to accommodate her disability. It's a break room!", "As far as I know,  I am neurotypical but (at least to some extent) I share your sensitivity to the sounds of eating and think earplugs or headphones are a great solution.  (I like music or audio books because I am prone to racing thoughts if I have nothing to listen to)\n\nI feel for the OP, and they are definitely not wrong but even more, I am really upset about Anna being expected to work in a space that is intended for non-work traffic- lunch,  personal calls, grabbing coffee, whatever.  Even for an NT trainee, that would be an unfair disadvantage and is setting her up to have resentment from coworkers who,  very reasonably,  expect to use the break room freely. The boss is an idiot and is actively fostering interpersonal problems.", "I too have this issue, it's actually called Misophonia. This is my problem and no one else's, I always do my best to handle it myself. Noise cancelling headphones are the best solution in my opinion.", "4 to 6 WEEKS of training in the break room though!!? I'm assuming videos and quizzes. That is ridiculous"]}
