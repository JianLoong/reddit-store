Let's say there is a zero tolerance on physical fights. Kid A escalates their bullying deciding to corner and beats up kid B. Kid B punches their assailant leaving a bruse and both get equally punished for being in a first time fight. (Something not unusual in zero tolerance policy settings.) Few months later Kid B gets picked on again by another kid. Kid B's past experience taught them that even when acting in strict self defense they will be punished. Therefore since they think they are going to be eventually punished anyway they decided to go on the offensive and viciously respond to the new bully.

Oy vey! \n\nPoor Sam must've felt mortified, isolated, and powerless to stop her awful mother - who she essentially was forced to watch, destroy her chances to develop a healthy, normal, active, light and fun social life. Sam's self-esteem must be in the bottom of the deepest well. \n\nIf folks like me are correct in our estimations, and Sam is nothing like her mother, but is instead a shy, self-effacing sweetheart (something that can easily be discovered) - you might find that choosing to ask her to align herself with you and become allies, could be the perfect answer to ending all your issues with this idiot, once and for all. If your son and Sam have a genuine detente, and manage the beginnings of a real friendship - then there would exist NOTHING about which the old bat could complain, let alone lodge a complaint. Your son would be off the hook for good.

I never heard that argument before and had to chew on it for a bit. I suppose the logic goes \"Because we discipline misdeeds regardless of other factors, everyone is treated equally.\"  Now I have questions.

How is this not getting a handle on his behavior? \n\nWhat are you taking issue with? That OP admits her son did something horrible but isn't willing to hold this over his head months after the fact?

I remember when my youngest son (now an adult) was in middle school, and during PE class someone took his coat and backpack from the bleachers (where they all were supposed to put their things) into the trash. Son got upset and was yelling. I get a call about how he's going to have to serve in-school suspension (\"it was really scary to the other students and should be out of school suspension\"). I assured the principal that I would take it seriously and talk with my son, but I did have one little question:  What was the teacher doing that he failed to stop bullying of my son during class? ... pin drop.\n\nI'm sure that wasn't the only issue, but he was not the PE teacher the next school year. Because yes--if you're going to punish my son for getting upset about being bullied, I'm going to be asking why a teacher isn't stopping bullying from taking place \\*during class\\*. So the upshot was that he only had one day of that in-school suspension instead of the three he was \"supposed\" to get, because I made it clear that I was going to push harder on the failure of the adult in the room. But my son \"had to be punished\" ... for being the victim of bullying and having the audacity to not just meekly take his things back out of the trash and pretend like everything was ok while the teacher let the class get so out of control that students could bully another student. TBH, I don't think my son should have been punished at all, but I just told him that in the future, he should not yell in school, just tell me when he got home ... and I would do the yelling for him--figuratively, I mean.

When I was in middle and high school (I'm in my early 20s, barely legal to drink so not that long ago), boys figured out what happened when you pulled a girl's bra strap back and let it hit their skin. Think rubber band. It was school-wide epidemic at some points. Middle school did jack-squat about it, but the high school cracked down hard on that behavior.  I stopped hearing it about happening sophomore year because consequences = reasons to change behavior. I doubt those boys choose random girls as targets for this, but girls they were already bothering. It never happened to me thankfully, but I knew girls it had happened to. Those girls were as sweet as pie to me, despite me being a very quiet girl with terrible social skills. \n\n**I would rather them crack down when its verbal and get a better chance of avoiding it turning physical.** I doubt any of my classmates would've had to put up with that nonsense if action had been taken.", "The issue with zero tolerance policies is that more often than not they don't actually do anything about bullying until the victim says fuck it and fights back after months or years. It is one of the least appropriate methods for handling bullying in a school.", "If the policy is that you get suspended for saying something mean, that's just a shitty policy. There's way too much research on the negative impacts of suspensions for schools to be justifying that policy these days. But that's the thing -- zero tolerance doesn't inherently mean that an infraction leads to a suspension. It could be a meeting with guidance or lunch with the principal. It could be something that might actually help the kid be less of an asshole \ud83e\udd37 What makes it zero-tolerance is that nobody, not one adult in the school, will let it slide.\n\nWe have a zero tolerance phone policy. The first time we take it to the office, then it escalates.

We do not ever let it slide, so they don't even try.", "The school has already gone the extra mile on this and what is happening is out of their control.
