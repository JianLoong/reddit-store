I literally just read an article about Facebook groups formed by parents that attend specific colleges and how they attempt to set up adult play dates for them because they don\u2019t have any friends yet. So trust me\u2026 it can happen. \n\nBut I think you are also downplaying how kids interact. They may not be reporting on anything, because Sam may not even be saying anything.

That's shitty implementation, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a shitty practice to have consistent, guaranteed consequences for particular behaviors. In fact, we know that consequences being consistently enforced is more effective in reducing unwanted behaviors in children than consequences being harsh. \n\nThe kid who said I hope there's a bomb threat -- somebody heard what they said, right? And that person reported it for a reason. Perhaps somebody *did* see it as a threat because they know that kid better than you do. \n\nMeanwhile, we had a student in an old district who told a teacher she was #something on his kill list, and his consequence was a chat with the AP and a bag of Takis because they don't have weapons at home/ he was kidding / he's experienced trauma. That's fucked up. \n\nKids need to know their words, serious or not, have major impacts on them and others.", "I agree that mandatory minimums are bad.

However zero tolerance often does do what the above poster outlines; removes critical thinking. If you are overly ridged with X always must yeild Y consqences with little nuance, then the law of unintended consqences leads to some unwanted situations. Where it encourages misbehaviour too. Let's say there is a zero tolerance on physical fights. Kid A escalates their bullying deciding to corner and beats up kid B. Kid B punches their assailant leaving a bruse and both get equally punished for being in a first time fight. (Something not unusual in zero tolerance policy settings.) Few months later Kid B gets picked on again by another kid. Kid B's past experience taught them that even when acting in strict self defense they will be punished. Therefore since they think they are going to be eventually punished anyway they decided to go on the offensive and viciously respond to the new bully. In order to make a point about not picking on them and get the anger and frustration out in the easiest way possible. \n\nThe point is having a default set of protocols devoid of allowing situational context and awareness doesn't allow for the fact that situations arise for various reasons and those reasons need to be accounted for. Misbehaviour shouldn't be excused, but also needs to be addressed within context. Ignoring root causes of behaviour can also allow behaviour to continue unfettered. Sometimes people use zero tolerance as a way to handle things without further depth letting unknown problems fester. There really needs to be a happy medium.
