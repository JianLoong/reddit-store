His role in their life doesn\u2019t diminish their relationships with their dads who they see all the time. We\u2019re now having our own baby and couldn\u2019t be happier. You need to ask your bf if being a family is in the future and if not, I wouldn\u2019t waste anymore time on him. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be with a man who doesn\u2019t want to see my kids as his own as well. Not saying anything against men who don\u2019t want to be stepdads.

Get rid of the boyfriend he sounds manipulative and is completely gaslighting you .. \u201cplaying mommy and daddy\u201d your not \u201cplaying\u201d anything\u2026 your just both doing your jobs as parents. This sounds like a typical case of a Toxic male trying to get involved with a single mom to try and manipulate her into choosing him over her kids, I swear men try to do this just to prove to them self there a gift to the world. He\u2019s insecure and shouldn\u2019t be involved or have any say on your relationships with your children\u2019s father, you should not have to explain yourself.", "YTA if you stay with this guy. Not everyone is able to date someone with kids and that is okay. You as the parent need to be the one who recognizes it though and puts a stop to it. Your boyfriend is going to have his best interest at heart not your kids and you are an AH for ignoring that because you are the one responsible for those kids not him.", "NTA. Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t understand the concept of peaceful coparenting - you and your ex are GOALS. \n\nYou deserve better than an insecure man-cub.", "NTA. \"Play mommy and daddy\" you ARE mommy and daddy. You are still co-parents. If your new partner doesn't get that, he can get moving.", "You were TA in the first situation, but not the second. You should not be playing babysitter at his house. That\u2019s not about being nice or not being nice. You each have your own space for the kids at your respective homes. It\u2019s just an all around bad idea and can be confusing for the kids. If you are going to have the kids, have them at your house. \n\nAs far as the trick or treating, that\u2019s no big deal.NTA. If you get along cordially enough, why not both walk with them. There are always going to be things going on in your kids lives where both parents should attend, and getting along is best for the kids. \n\nBut the issue of Saturday directly preceding ToT, I\u2019m not surprised that your boyfriend was butt-hurt. \n\nYou need better boundaries with your ex and better communication with your boyfriend. He needs to understand that not all exes are at each other\u2019s throats, and that\u2019s good for the kids.", "NTA OP. If he is acting this way now, imagine if you marry him? Would he try and claim to be the father figure now and try to ban your ex from having any presence in your kids lives? Dude is raising more red flags then a Soviet military parade.", "Absolutely agree. The boyfriends reaction is also alarming to me. Sounds like he has trust issues to overreact at OP going trick or treating with their kids father.", "INFO: Is your boyfriend \"nice\" to any of his exes or female friends?\n\nI don't need it for a judgment, I'm just interested in the tea.", "My brother's ex is going through health complications and all manner of stress and right now is living in my brother's house where his fianc\u00e9 and his teenage son reside. No one is stressed out about that no matter how uncommon it might look to strangers.\n\n Life does not have to be complicated, but sometimes people get it twisted anyway, it seems? \ud83e\udd23", "Men like this are notorious for *not* making any adjustments in themselves and demanding everyone else bow to their whims. He's petty and jealous. My ex was the same way, he took it personally that just because his ex wife raked him over the coals and I was civil with my ex, he would try to bad mouth their father in from of my kids. He's gotta go, this will only escalate from here. He has no right to make *any* demands on how op chooses to coparent. NTA unless she stays with this guy.\n\nEdited for spelling errors.", "100%! They have a great co-parenting relationship which is in the kids best interest. BF is the AH.", "This 100%", "One of the good things about marriage is that there is a clear process to end it, and a lot of formalities that ensure that it\u2019s ended and there are clear expectations.\n\nWhereas in a non-marital relationship there can be a much more of a gray area.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t care about what the new boyfriend thinks, but having their parents play happy family, but only sometimes, can be quite a mindfuck for the kids. They get their hopes up when they see their parents together, and then it all comes crashing down at the end of the day.", "He has mentioned it before but it\u2019s been quite awhile. Over a year. He (my bf) doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time with my kids and is not involved with any parenting I do. We also do not live together. Which I did mention to him if he were more involved, he would be more included in the choices I make regarding the kids.", "Thank you! I was looking for someone who pointed this out and I\u2019m shocked I had to scroll this far", "Don\u2019t even consider it the guy reeks oh jealousy so bad even Phthonus is envious of the guy. If he can\u2019t handle OP mearly co parenting now imagine if they were to have their own kids together", "Sounds like she already has one- her ex.\n\nAs a person dating someone with kids, I love their child and the life we\u2019re building together after his marriage ended.\n\nBut if OP wants the ease and pros of being close with her kids father THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE STAYED TOGETHER *that\u2019s what co-parenting is* it doesn\u2019t start after the separation because there are cons, this is one of them- literally a case of not getting your cake and eating it too. \n\nLike, op and ex, if you want to figure shit out for your kids- fix your relationship and don\u2019t make someone suffer. Don\u2019t even bother with a relationship because another person will be okay with kids, but the ex was made an ex for a reason, why do so many people ignore this???\n\nI hope this new bf leaves, fuck this noise \n\n1) kids\n2) partner\n3) ex\n\nNOT\n\n1) kids\n2) ex\n3) partner", "Thankfully we already discussed children and he doesn\u2019t want any. And I don\u2019t want any more. So we won\u2019t be having any together.", "I do agree with you about Saturday. But I will say the moment my bf said he didn\u2019t like the idea, I said no problem and changed the plans to bringing the kids home instead. My thought was more time with my bf by watching the kids at their dads. But even initially I wasn\u2019t even comfortable doing it. I just wanted to spend more time with my bf and not miss a night with him because the kids dad went to a party.", "There's no issue watching kids at the other parents house. Nothing shared so far mentioned an issue with \"boundaries\" with the mom and the ex.", "He only has one female friend that I know of. He doesn\u2019t speak to his exes. And the one female friend he really only seems to care for because she\u2019s been there for him through a lot.", "I'm going to have to disagree with you. I think there is a lot of value in showing your children what an amicable relationship looks like after separation. There definitely needs to be clear and open communication between the children and the parents. But its not a bad thing to show these kids that even though mommy and daddy aren't in a romantic relationship anymore, that doesn't mean that they can't still be friends, or that they can't still do things as a family.\n\nIMO this is the most mature way you can possibly coparent.", "Why in the world would you let him make decisions involving your children???? He already feels he has the right to control you .\n\nIf it were up to him he\u2019d keep the kids away from their father.", "Please don\u2019t double down with this dude and move in together. He doesn\u2019t spend time with your kids bc he isn\u2019t interested in parenting them. He does seem interested in controlling you though. Ick", "His attitude about your kids definitely says he is not ready to parent, which is inevitable if you lived together. Please take this relationship slowly for the sake of your children. It sounds like you and your ex have a good co-parenting thing going, don't let your bf ruin it. Unfortunately for your bf, the father of your children is always going to part of your life.", "For the love of God, do NOT move in with this man and give him any authority over your children. He clearly cannot handle a co-parenting relationship and sounds like a nightmare. He does not NEED to be more \u201cincluded\u201d in the choices you make in regards to YOUR kids.", "Actually it\u2019s \n1) kids\n2) me\n3) partner\n\nThe ex isn\u2019t on my list. Good try though. I don\u2019t do anything for my ex. I do everything for my kids. Thanks for making me laugh though. I needed it.", "Their dad and I don\u2019t always get along but we do the best for the kids. We do mutually agree however that we no longer want a romantic relationship and only want to communicate for the benefit of our children. I do not love him anymore, I tolerate him for my kids. If I had a choice I\u2019d never see him again. But unfortunately you have to do things you don\u2019t always want to do for the sake of your kids and their happiness.", "Interesting.", "OP\u2026this dude has to go. You do right by your kids. Always. \n\nMy daughter is 17. She tells me all the time that she\u2019s the only person she knows who\u2019s parents like each other and get along. We do stuff with our kid, sometimes just us 3 and sometimes with our current spouses(who also get along). \n\nMy daughter is such a great kid. And though her dad and I are not perfect people, we really do make a huge effort to care about each other for our kid. Anyone who thinks that\u2019s weird can get bent. And she\u2019s told me flat out how much this has meant to her growing up. \n\nThis stuff will absolutely make a difference in your childrens lives. Keep the good relationship with your ex, ditch the bf. He doesn\u2019t have your kids best interests at heart, just his own childish jealousy", "I\u2019m sorry, OP. They\u2019ve always \u2018been through a lot\u2019 or \u2018been there for him through a lot\u2019. In my (extensive) experience, cheaters tend to be a lot more paranoid about their partners cheating.", "To be clear, I would never allow anyone to make decisions for my children. However I have no problem including him and discussing things with him as his feeling and opinions do matter to me. But my children will always come first.", "Nailed it!", "He already has a problem with you even walking around the street with your ex . You don\u2019t think him interfering With Your relationship with your kids father isn\u2019t going to affect your kids in the long run???.\n\nBeing with a man who\u2019s going to throw a fit if your kids dad invited to birthday parties and special occasions like graduations and big milestones . \nOr if your children a dad picks them up from the house you share with him if you move in.\n\nYour kids will end resenting you for being with an insecure man that wants to erase their father from their lives .", "But you are letting him make decisions if you stop seeing your ex and children at the same time? He's the one choosing that. Not you, not your ex, and not your children.", "Clearly they don\u2019t come first if you\u2019re keeping a guy around who wants to ruin your co-parenting relationship.", "How is him saying his needs (not feeling comfortable having their partner share a sleeping space with their ex) controlling?\n\nDon\u2019t you think if it was convenient for OP and the ex to have trade off child care like that they should LIVE together all the time?\n\nOP can\u2019t be in a relationship and choose to watch her kids during the exes time and have her new partner be uncomfortable with it and then have them be labelled controlling for having a reasonable boundary. These comments are killing me and doing a great job of demonstrating how so many fucked up relationships people keep if they think this is anything other than OP being an AH\n\nSolution: OP should have told ex to find a babysitter or trade a night for a night. \n\nseparation means SEPARATE, not \u201cwhen convenient for us (again, no mention of the actual kids feelings here at all) at the expense of all other and future partners\u201d smdh", "I don\u2019t disagree with you. But I also very firmly believe there are underlying reasons he\u2019s insecure that have nothing to do with myself or my kids. Basically it\u2019s a Jim problem that he needs to fix. I can\u2019t fix it for him", "But he did not make that decision nor has he ever. The kids dad went with us trick or treating so\u2026.", "Did anyone say he was staying around?

I mean, they could be total dicks and make their children's lives miserable..... like you seem to think they should. \nOOOOOOOORRRRRRRR......\nThey can act like adults and be friendly. \n\nNote: she was not going to sleep over at her ex's. She was going to be at his place without him and put her kids to bed there. Then she was going to leave and go to get bfs.

Yes his insecurities have nothing to with you but yet it doesn\u2019t stop him from taking it out on you does it??\n\nHes being controlling and when you don\u2019t do as he says he gets angry .  That shit\u2019s ABUSIVE. \n\nIf he  has your this wrapped already , do your kids a favor and give your ex full custody.  \n\nThey shouldnt have to pay for your bad taste in angry, insecure men.", "Yes, we all agree that his behavior sucks.\n\nINFO:  Do you think he is willing and able to change?", "This is Reddit, if you don't break up with someone the moment you have the slightest disagreement, people will come at you.

My kids aren\u2019t going anywhere. And it\u2019s pretty rude of you to say that. I\u2019m not defending him. I plainly stated that I can see it\u2019s his problem and not something I did. Cool your jets with telling me to give them to their dad. There are good reasons I have full custody.", "At this point no", "Yeah, everyone is saying I\u2019m nta and he is. You\u2019re the only one saying I\u2019m doing the wrong thing. Only you. I\u2019ve not been defensive towards anyone but you because you are trying to say I don\u2019t put my children first when clearly I did put them first because we went trick or treating WITH THEIR FATHER. Regardless of what my boyfriend said.", "My apologies . You sound like a good mom willing to keep a good relationship with their father , despite your misgivings of him . Which makes it a bit more frustrating your willingness to give in to your controlling bf\u2019s whims (not letting the kids get more rest by staying at their dad\u2019s)or letting him bait you into arguments where he questions your loyalty . \n\n\u201cClaims being separated means we don\u2019t do ANYTHING together anymore PERIOD. Even if it is for the kids.\u201d   \n\nSo because he feels this way , then you should too ? And when you don\u2019t , he gets angry.  How is this not abusive behavior ??\n\nFor context , I lost a sibling who\u2019s widow dated a person like your bf . Controlling  and insecure,quick to anger when things didn\u2019t go their way,wouldn\u2019t even allow my sibling\u2019s picture in the house . Resented the children for looking like my sibling .
