She is a wonderful bird but has a lot of issues due to an abusive former home. I've had her for 3 years and since then haven't taken any vacations or trips away as it would be too disruptive for her. She distrusts everyone and is very reliant on her routine. I love her deeply and I'm happy to make sacrifices for her. They are permanent toddlers and very intelligent birds.\n\nI met my husband by the time his kids were older, my stepdaughter was 16 at the time. We married when she moved away for college. Nevertheless I thought we'd managed to have a decent relationship, until now... my stepdaughter is getting married in March, and naturally there's a lot of preparation involved. They're wanting a huge traditional wedding and she is stressed out of her mind. They live out of state, and she invited me recently to come visit her for a week to help make wedding plans and spend time with their 2yo. I declined and she insisted to know why, acting very hurt, and I explained the parrot... Well jt all went downhill from there. \n\nShe caused a massive fuss with her dad, saying she never got a mother figure and I never accepted her as my full blood daughter and this is the ultimate snub for a silly animal. That I'm cold and emotionless... I feel really hurt and I can tell he agrees with her even though he's refusing to take sides. But I don't see why I should be expected to take holiday time off work to babysit and \"bond\" all of a sudden and I don't see how I'm a monster for this... am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: context of our relationship, we don't usually talk at all and she hasn't visited home in 4 years.", "created_utc": 1673906532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dttwx/aita_for_prioritising_my_parrot_over_my/", "score": 2076, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's going to be a multi-day trip...", "I was leaning to a NAH judgement but then I read your edit and comments on how the stepdaughter has only spoken to you 5 times in 4 years and that's been through your husband. The bird is a factor but overall, your stepdaughter is probably looking to use you as free childcare and is now trying to guilt you into coming for the week by moaning on how she needs a mother now more than ever to your husband.\n\nYou have tried to maintain a relationship with her from what your comments say while she's given you the bare minimum.\n\nMy judgement is NTA. Tell your husband that the bird isn't the issue, it's his daughter suddenly wanting a relationship which seems to only be to use you as a babysitter she doesn't need to pay.", "I actually agree with both sides but you need to sit down and decide what your stepdaughter is to you. Do you want her to call you grandma? Do you want to be around your grandkids? Do you want her in your life?\n\nI don\u2019t agree with dropping everything for a week but what\u2019s preventing you from doing zoom calls and being a part online? From what you wrote, you aren\u2019t even trying to be involved. That\u2019s ok, it\u2019s your choice, but it will change your relationship with your husband, stepkid and grandchild. Is it worth that? Cause those are humans that will support you til you die. Your parrot, while extremely important, will not give you a life outside their cage. \n\nI\u2019m gonna say NAH as long as you figure out what you want for the future and set clear and appropriate boundaries.", "If you had no parrot, would you have said yes? If not, then the bird has nothing to do with it. If you don't want to go for a week, that's fine but just say so. It doesn't sound like you all have much of a close relationship to begin with. On the flip side, if she really only wanted you to come to babysit, she should have also been honest about that as well.", "NTA potentially destroying years worth of work doesnt sound worth spending a week with people who never talk to you", "NTA. Just because you didn\u2019t meet her unspoken expectations doesn\u2019t mean you owe your step-daughter anything.  People who don\u2019t get it never will. Some people think pets are possessions.", "Question. Are you literally never going to leave the bird ever again? If so that is not healthy", "Need more info.  I'm not sure what \"distrusts everyone and is very reliant on her routine\" means.  Is there no way you can start transitioning your husband to handle its care while you're away?", "NTA\n\nYou didn't help raise this person. You weren't married to her dad until she was an adult and went to college.\n\nIf your step daughter really wants to have a bonded relationship with you, she's got a funny way of going about it. Demanding you come help her with her giant wedding then having a tantrum when you're not available.\n\nAlso, she's NOT your \"full-blood\" daughter, so why would you have to accept her as that? The fact that she \"never got a mother figure\" is not your fault, it's her bio-mother's fault. Sounds like she's taking that out on you.", "You are still going to the wedding, however, correct?  You didn't decline attending the wedding, did you?  I'm assuming that it's just the extended time away from the bird for a full-week that you cannot do, but you can manage to miss a few days for the wedding.  If that is the case, then you are not an a-hole, but if you are missing the week of preparation AND the wedding because of your pet, this makes you an a-hole.\n\nIf my assumption is correct and you are not an a-hole, and your stepdaughter is only now seeking your involvement due to needing a babysitter, and in the past has not involved you in things, and so this \"ask\" feels out of character, then you not being available is permissible and \"the why\" doesn't matter.  It could have been that you didn't have the vacation days to spare with the wedding and other future plans.\n\nHer claiming you are putting an animal ahead of her is no worse than her using you for babysitting under the pretense of \"bonding.\"", "NTA, you can choose to do what you want with your life. Put up boundaries if they serve you, but understand when reciprocal boundaries are deployed.  Offer to help virtually, but this definitely sounds like a free babysitting play", "Info  You kind of contradict yourself as to your motives. You decline to go because of the bird. But then you bemoan that you would have to take time off in order to \u201cbabysit and bond.\u201d Those are very different reasons. If someone you were close to was having a wedding out of state, would you made accommodations for the bird and attend the weddings?  If you didn\u2019t have the bird would you agree to taking the time off for your stepdaughter\u2019s wedding?  Are you not going solely because you have to take care of the bird? Or is your relationship with your stepdaughter also factoring into your decision?", "Wow. All you people who are saying that OP is the a h. She met stepdaughter\u2019s dad when the girl was 16. Not 6! Then the stepdaughter went to college 2-3 years later. How much bonding do you think they did? Y\u2019all keep saying OP is the only mother figure she had, while we don\u2019t really know about the girl\u2019s actual mother. It\u2019s more likely that the girl thinks of OP as \u2018Dad\u2019s wife and not my mom\u2019. \nHow many of you would leave their \u201cpresshus furbaby\u201d who has separation anxiety in order to drop things for a week, to help provide free childcare to someone? \n\nSome redditors be crazy. \n\nOP, you are NTA. Your bird has suffered neglect for 15 years, and if it doesn\u2019t trust anyone else, I also wouldn\u2019t leave it to stress and starve.", "NAH I can understand both sides. Maybe your stepdaughter thought wedding preps were a great way to bond with you albeit your relationship seems politely distanced aside from that. At the same time, I'm an animal person. I've cared for animald, I've had pets, and I get it. I just get that you don't want to leave the bird alone. Throwing away three years of progress would frel horrible. At the same time though, maybe try to find people (women) who are also accustomed to taking care of birds so you have someone to take care of her if you have to go somewhere. Some things aren't voluntary. If you get into an accident, the bird is alone, if somebody else needs you to go somewhere urgently for a few days, you can't go.", "NTA\n\nIn terms of you two bonding it sounds like she maybe didn\u2019t put in effort for it either. To not come home for 4 years and you two not talk much after this many years of knowing each other makes it equal fault. Because it\u2019s equal fault, she has no right to flip her lid about it. She can\u2019t just accuse and blame you solely for the relationship that\u2019s missing. She should\u2019ve communicated nicely, and she should\u2019ve started sooner. \n\nNow she might be trying to create a bond after not having it before, but she needs to accept if you don\u2019t want or don\u2019t care to. She needs to be understanding in general. I don\u2019t know birds but I\u2019m sure some compromise could be found if it was her wedding DAY. Not planning it. It doesn\u2019t sound like you want to go, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019d be against it if the bird wasn\u2019t a factor. Meaning why is she really wanting your help? If you aren\u2019t that close?\n\nNot to mention it\u2019s her wedding? She and her fianc\u00e9 should be figuring the pieces out. If they can\u2019t do it then maybe it\u2019s not meant to be imo. She can call you, or FaceTime, or zoom with you to try to talk more, to get your opinions on wedding things, but you don\u2019t really owe her help. If you two aren\u2019t close IMO you don\u2019t owe her that. \n\nI get some lowkey vibes that she has had resentment towards you for a while and is quick to anger when issues arise with you? Idk what the story was before with her mother but imo you\u2019re not her biological mother and it sounds like the bond isn\u2019t there. If you two really want a bond start communicating otherwise you don\u2019t owe her anything. She sounds like she needs to grow up, and stop aiming her anger at sources that didn\u2019t cause it. \n\nShe aimed her anger from her stress at her dad to attack you. She\u2019s not communicating and she\u2019s not being mature. If she was she\u2019d accept why you can\u2019t go and shut up and get on with her life and her plans. \n\nHer losing it and causing the drama makes you NTA from the context given.", "I'd normally say you were an asshole for putting a bird before family, but you've made it clear she's been pretty distant with you. \n\nThe thing about realtionships (*all* realtionships) is they require effort and attention. Just because you're related (by blood or law) doesn't mean someone is entitled to your presence, especially if the realtionship isn't exactly a good one.\n\nYou aren't the asshole. I assume if your realtionship were better, you'd make more of an effort. You're still going, so it isn't like you're *skipping* the wedding.\n\nNTA, I don't blame you.\n\nEdit: also, my sister has twins and more often than not, \"spending time\" with the kids means baby sitting them, this doesn't sound like a vacation, but a desire to put you to work.", "NTA- macaws and parrots are not just \u201cbirds\u201d like budgies where you can ask a pet sitter to feed and water them all week. Macaws are like gifted children who scream and can rip your fingers off. They are a 80 year commitment and often only bond to a single person. Birds in general are extremely sensitive to any environmental changes so someone who doesn\u2019t know what they are doing can hurt or even kill the macaw.\n\nShame on everyone for saying \u201cchoosing an animal over family\u201d like it\u2019s a bad thing. The macaw seems more like family than her step daughter.  If it was that big of a deal then step daughter would help make accommodations rather than just want a baby sitter.", "NTA. This is an adult woman wanting you to drop everything to help her plan her wedding and watch her kid when you don\u2019t really have a relationship? The bird is entirely beside the point.", "NTA. speaking from experience, caring for pets with PTSD is a whole other thing that people don't really understand unless they've got experience. i have cats, i imagine it might be worse with a parrot. stepdaughter calls it a \"silly animal\"-- it's family. pets are family. your stepdaughter must not have ever had a pet. also it seems like she just wants you to come over to be free childcare while she makes wedding plans-- \"help make wedding plans and spend time with their 2yo\". i wish you and your parrot well!", "I\u2019m going with NTA but with some advice having been someone who was \u201cgrounded\u201d by a fur baby for several years.\n\nFirst, it sounds like DIL is just looking to use you since there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a relationship outside of this wedding when she all of a sudden needs free help. \n\nSecond, I also was grounded from my elderly cat who passed last September. He was my first baby since 2008 and had gotten a lot of health issues and was on multiple medications due to hyperthyroidism and losing too much weight from not eating enough. It was insanely stressful and the level of personal responsibility I felt over his life caused me to not vacation for four years. I did have to travel for work occasionally though and had my husband well taught on caring for him in my absence. I had to TRUST my husband to do it and let go of the need for control, and he honestly did a great job. M\n\nMy point? You could leave the care of the bird in your husband\u2019s hands. You need a back up. Parrots live a very long time and you will hate your life if you never figure out a way to have a break here and there.", "Eeerrrr\n\nAnyone else feel like the AITA post titles are a bit \u2026.. off (if I am being generous; cuckoo was the word that really came to mind)", "YTA and you can say goodbye to any relationship with your step daughter. She hasn\u2019t visited in 4 years? Well have you? Also there was a pandemic for most of that and people weren\u2019t travelling, plus she was pregnant then had a baby. You\u2019re selfish and I disagree with all the NTA.", "Based on your comments, this isn\u2019t *really* about the bird, because you\u2019re willing to find a solution for the bird for the wedding. So you have someone you trust to take care of the bird. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to help with wedding planning or watching the kids. It\u2019s not enough of a priority to you to get help with the bird. I\u2019m not sure that really makes you an asshole, but I understand completely why your stepdaughter is upset. She wanted to involve you in a really important milestone and you rejected that. \n\nYTA for blaming it solely on the bird.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t get to decide whether or not your excuse is \u2018good enough\u2019. \n\nAlso, it sounds like she wants some free work from someone she\u2019s not that close to. That\u2019s expecting too much.", "NTA - while I think you shouldn\u2019t put your entire life on hold for the bird, that\u2019s a decision you made so if you miss events that\u2019s something you\u2019ll need to deal with. I\u2019m more stuck on how you\u2019re expected to drop everything for two weeks when you two aren\u2019t super close (even more so with your edit).", "NTA: I do not think you are an asshole at all for your position. It sounds like from your post, neither of you wanted to have a parental relationship and didn\u2019t frankly have the time to build one when she moved to college.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly telling that she thinks that insulting you will get you to bond in that type of relationship. It\u2019s sounds like that this is news to you that she was looking for a mother figure despite you meeting her as an adult.\n\nShe invited you. You are not a dog that you can summon to do any tasks. Invitation are just invitations. They are not summons nor demands.  She cannot demand to ask you to be a wedding planner and child care.\n\nThen when you decline respectfully because you are responsible for pets who rely on you. She insults you. \n\nIf your husband her father is so worried about the stress of planning the wedding then he should go be wedding planner and child care. Not demand you do that. \n\nPlus from your comments. She did not to suggest she wanted that bond. Mother and daughter relationships require more than 4 or 5 calls over a span of years. In a healthy relationship they would talk more than that during the year.\n\nThis reeks of entitlement on your stepdaughter part", "Unless you know parrots in general (and how people finicky they can be, especially abused ones), this isn't an animal you can simply drop off at a pet sitter. OP could lose the previously abused birds trust if the bird thinks OP had abandoned them. \n\nSame time, you are already associating \\*bonding\\* as being a free babysitter. Also, a last minute one at that. Maybe it's true, maybe it's not. Just sounded a little callous, but then again you are NOT obligated to be her babysitter. NTA.", "I don\u2019t think your stepdaughter is as upset by the fact you declined her invitation as she is your reason why.  Did you tell her the parrot was your only reason for declining?  Did you also mention you needed to clear it with your boss first?  \n\nI am assuming you are a responsible pet parent.  This means the parrot has a regular veterinarian.  Most vets have boarding facilities for pets.  They kinda have to in case the pet needs overnight stays due to illness or surgery.", "NTA - she doesn\u2019t usually speak to you or take time out to get to know you but all of a sudden she wants you to come for a week and spend time with her and her 2 year old?

She's planning on using you for free childcare, and honestly sounds very entitled.", "NTA as long as you're not skipping the wedding. \n\nPeople getting married get one day that is solely about them. Not a bunch of free wedding planning and child care labour for a week. Not sure why everyone gets so entitled about wedding expectations but it's ridiculous to expect more than showing up to celebrate the wedding day unless the person WANTS to help more. Asking sure, but respect the no if you get one in response.\n\nFor context, I'm engaged and currently planning a 60-65 person wedding.", "NTA. I don't like birds. But you get to choose what you do with your time. It'd be nice if you went, but you want to keep a stable home for a traumatized pet. A lot of comments are saying \"it's just a BIRD who cares?\" What if it was a dog in the same circumstances? What if you rescued a dog from fighting pits? No one would give you shit because most people can sympathize with dogs. You love this bird like family and it sounds like she is only taking her own needs into account, maybe even just banking on free childcare. Don't let people bully you into doing something you're not comfortable with.", "Nah because I understand both sides. \n\nPeople will never grasp that animals, like humans, can and do have different needs and I understand how hard it is with abused animals. \nYour parrot can't just be cared for by anybody. \nOn top of that, stressing yourself and him out for a stepdaughter that, up until this point, has wanted no relationship with you, I wouldn't either. \n\nOn that same token, your step daughter doesn't understand that and that's fair. It's totally understandable for her to be so upset.", "You are the bird's mate, period. Yes, it's very difficult for you to go away. Your commitment will be years long (but you know that, of course... just filling in for others). You'll get a lot of y-t-a-s from people that don't know much about those types of birds.\n\nThe invitation was very kind on her part. She reached out to you.

If you two never talk and she hasn\u2019t even been home in 4 years I don\u2019t get why she turned to you now. Doesn\u2019t she have MOH or bridesmaids whose role is to help with the wedding? I\u2019m in two minds about your birdie because I know I\u2019d be dead worried about leaving my dog for that long as he has separation anxiety and abandonment issues, while I also suffer with anxiety. But you also should start working on helping your birdie become a bit more independent. It\u2019s been a slow journey for my dog and I but small steps help. Someone suggested you go see your stepdaughter for a few days rather than 2 weeks. That seems like a good starting point.", "NTA, because it sounds like she was trying to get free childcare and labor out of you rather than wanting bonding time.  Your title made it sound like you'd be missing the wedding.  You definitely need to go to the wedding, because at that point you're taking it too far putting the bird over family.\n\nMaybe offer if there's anything you can do to help prepare from home, if that's something you want to do.\n\nETA: if you are going to make sure to make it to the wedding, you need to clarify that in the post, because I think a lot of people are reading this as you saying you won't be going to the wedding.", "**NTA.** You shouldn\u2019t be expected to put your life aside for somebody who hasn\u2019t even visited in four years. Now that she needs help she chooses to pull this guilt trip over her needing a mother figure? No. Stay with your baby bird who is devoted to you. Fuck that", "NTA, to be honest the parrot sounds like much more likable than the stepdaughter.

Personally YTA for the line about her not visiting in 4 years\u2026so the fact that she was pregnant then with a 1-2 year old doesn\u2019t grant her grace for not visiting more often?

Are you planning to literally never travel anywhere or go on vacation until this bird dies?

The people saying y-t-a are pricks man. Y'all are a bunch of teens who don't understand adult responsibility and have clearly never worked with animals - particularly special needs animals - before. As far as OP's side goes, we understand that the step-daughter hadn't ever really expressed an interest in having a relationship, which is fine. She probably accepted that she's the stepmom to an older child and that they don't have that sort of connection. But now, all of the sudden, the stepdaughter wants a full week of childcare and labor? Huh? I don't think I could manage that for some of my closest people to me, not in this economy. \n\nParrots are difficult birds to find sitters for. Especially one with an abused past. I've done a lot of sitting for special needs animals, whose owners hadn't gone on vacation in a decade because no one was qualified to help out. Birds are more than just feeding them and cleaning their cage. Like she said, they're large, intelligent toddler-esque creatures. She's not not attending the ceremony!! It's not that she's not going at all or taking any time to come visit. She just doesn't want to leave her bird - who has grown highly reliant on her for routine and support - alone in their home for an entire week, being taken care of by potential strangers. Also, would it be great to have friends and fam pitch in time and energy to help with the wedding planning and prep? Of course. I'm planning on asking around for assistance on my own wedding. I wouldn't have the entitlement and audacity to be pissed off and offended if they declined, for ANY reason. If everything in OP's post is true, and details aren't being intentionally left out, then the stepdaughter is one entitled chick. I get she's stressed about the wedding, that's fair. But she doesn't get to go around making demands of people like that. Being a bride doesn't make you no grand pubah of nothing.", "NTA, but I understand why daughter might be upset. I don't know much about birds but is there anything you can do, mb plan the trip to her that wouldn't be soon and in the meantime try to introduce your parrot to someone who is a woman, has experience with birds and can \"babysit\"? Bc it sounds like your stepdaughter could really use your help and support, but I also understand it's important for an abused animal to have a routine and I don't think you can take them with you. But even if you're not going now, having someone who can take care of your parrot and with whom they'll be comfortable with is important in case anything happens to you and also for their health. As I said, I don't know much about birds, but they are intelligent and I think there could be some way to work through trauma\u00bf I mean, I know with dogs you can do it, and I know that crows are like 7 year olds, so smarter than dogs, I assume parrots somewhere in that range and can be trained too\u00bf", "YTA\n\nSo I do rescue (kittens not parrots) so I get it. In the summer when it is kitten season I don't travel. It's my life. \n\nHowever, you're not doing the right thing by making that bird dependent on you and only you. At some point you may need to travel or you make it sick and end up in the hospital. \n\nRather than develop a situation where you've got to deal with a major problem and your bird, It's best to start conditioning the bird to be away from you now.\n\nTalk to your local bird store and find out what options are available to you. It might mean having your bird go visit a pet sitter for a day. But they're intelligent creatures. So once he starts learning that you're going to go away but come back, he'll be able to cope with that. \n\nYou might also talk to your veterinarian about what options are available to you such as anti-anxiety drugs.\n\nIf you want to stay home for the rest of your days, that's fine.

They're wanting a huge traditional wedding and she is stressed out of her mind. They live out of state, and she invited me recently to come visit her for a week to help make wedding plans and spend time with their 2yo. I declined and she insisted to know why, acting very hurt, and I explained the parrot... Well jt all went downhill from there. \n\nShe caused a massive fuss with her dad, saying she never got a mother figure and I never accepted her as my full blood daughter and this is the ultimate snub for a silly animal. That I'm cold and emotionless... I feel really hurt and I can tell he agrees with her even though he's refusing to take sides.

Seems like it hasn't been the best time and life gets busy.\n\nAnd into the macaw, I've rescued parrots, we had a quaker that came to us that self mutilated, even though the owner THOUGHT they were doing what was best for them, they just weren't, they had a completely dependant relationship on each other, macaws and other parrots are flock animals, they're meant to be with other birds, they're meant to forage and fly around and be constantly enriched, the quaker I took in couldn't be on her own (because they're flock animals) but we aren't birds, we can't give them every thing they need and it leads to frustration and mutilation. Especially if they've been hand reared which I'm guessing that's the case as it usually is with most big birds, probably since that bird has been born its been away from mum and fed by people.\n\nIf all health related stuff have been ruled out then it will be psychological. I personally don't agree with keeping a parrot on their own, the one we took in would watch videos of other Quakers all day long with their owner, when she came here we built her an aviary, she was then with other parrots for the first time in her life, she bonded with one and they're now mates for life and she's SOOO much happier. They will groom and cuddle all day, also do the nasty lol. But that's what parrots are naturally meant to do, have you built any outdoor access for her? Does she have constant enrichment throughout the day, parrots are expensive and shouldn't be kept inside constantly in a cage. They were never meant to be.\n\nContinuing never leaving her and not looking at other options is on you, not your step daughter, it does seem she's trying to reach out and you've took it as a negative thing.

It may help the perspective of the situation.", "INFO\n\nReading what you wrote and the comments that you wrote... it appears that your commitment to the bird's full recovery is your number 1 priority in life.  And that's fine; I wouldn't criticize that.\n\nIf I were your stepdaughter, and only knew you a little bit for two years and you moved in when I moved out... it would probably be a bit hard for me to figure out how to relate to you.  And as a 18 year old, I'd probably look toward your actions to figure out if you had any interest in me as a person.\n\nI've known a lot of step situations... both with the children living home and when they're older.  Its pretty much the norm that the step parent has little to no interest in step children, especially if they're grown.\n\nSo its very possible that while you were busy with the bird, your step daughter internalized the message that you weren't available/interested.\n\n(As a side note, my adoptive from birth mother? when I'd call home she'd monologue about politics and sports and then say 'okay, here's your dad'... without ever giving me a chance to say anything to her, or asking me a single question about how i was doing.  If my experience sounds familiar to you...)\n\nAnd you weren't available.  How could you have traveled when you first had the bird?  Between COVID, and it not being safe for the bird's mental health for you to leave her (the bird) alone... would it have made sense to invite you?\n\n(As a second aside, how are you going to make sure the bird is okay for the wedding?  Do you have someone who can provide adequate care?).\n\nI'm also feeling from your write up and comments that you're not interested in this step daughter... but that instead of just admitting you're not interested, you want to find ways to blame her for there not being a relationship.  It's just better to admit (at least to yourself) that you married the man, but that you waited for the children to be gone because they didn't interest you.  A very large majority of step parents feel this way.  Admitting it makes it so that you're less likely to hurt anyone as then everything is on the table.\n\nI think also that when your step daughter complains that she never got a mother figure (i think in comments that you mention that the birth mother was out of the picture by age 6... which... really sucks), that shows that she did spend all that time hoping for something from you... something she never got.  And its normal for step children to want a step parent to fill that void.\n\nSome people can do it; most can't.  Most.  can't.  Being honest about it helps.\n\nAs far as your husband's reaction... I think you should allow him to feel how he feels.  It's good that he's not taking sides, and I would hope that everyone would appreciate that.  Some battles are best to side step.\n\nBut also, he's probably not reacting based on just this week, but on the totality of the relationships over time.\n\nWhat I mean is this: if you didn't have the special needs parrot, how would you have otherwise avoided helping with the wedding?\n\nI ask because, based on everything here... I'm pretty sure that you didn't want to go for anything more than the ceremony.\n\nAnd again, being honest at least to yourself about that is probably a helpful thing.\n\nThere's something about what you wrote and how you phrased things that reminds me of my own \"mom\" who drove out during the week I was having my commissioning in the military and my graduation from college.  Or that's why she told my dad she was coming.  In reality? She went to record shows (she's a collector) and missed both of my events.  I knew already that I meant nothing to her, that there was no relationship, so I found her missing the events a bit funny.  My ex was furious and I would have never told my dad what happened.\n\nMy dad, best I understand the universe, is in Jewish heaven right now.  if I had to talk to him about it (if I died before my mom), then I'd tell him \"Its okay.  After adopting me as a 3 month old, she never bonded to me.  She wasn't able to. Not her fault.  Its okay all the things she missed. She never meant anything by missing them... those events just carried no meaning for her. its okay...", "Regardless of what your stepdaughter's prior interest in a relationship with you was before this, she will always believe - from this decision on - you have no interest in a relationship with her.

I can also see why this hurt your step daughter (although I do think she could definitely have handled it better and I hope she comes around). Based on what you say she said to her father about never having a mother figure or being accepted by you, it sounds like she has some typical abandonment trauma. Since weddings are largely considered a very important day in people\u2019s lives, it can bring to the forefront any wounds around important relationships and their role in life milestones. Maybe you declining to be more involved triggered a trauma response in her from her mother wound? I suspect she may have felt rejected and may be feeling the absence of a mother figure in her life really heavily right now leading up to the wedding, and that\u2019s the place she had that reaction from. Obviously I\u2019m not familiar with the dynamics in your family, but as someone with a special interest in psychology and trauma, this is what stands out to me from your story. Maybe what you know about trauma and healing can help you to connect with and support her in a way that doesn\u2019t compromise your commitment to your macaw?

But my local bird store boards birds and I have left her there many times. I have also brought her there many times to go shopping with me or to have her nails done and beak trimmed. She is very used to the store and the people around her. If you are not taking your bird out at least to the bird store to get trimmed and looked after that is on you. At the very least, you could check to see if your vet does boarding and if you don't have a vet, well...

I would also see the bond he had with my dad, though, and I would look at him, and I would see a clearly intelligent creature looking back at me.

However, relationships go two ways and need give and take from both people, it\u2019s not really fair to expect OP to be the one doing ALL the work reaching out and trying to bond, if a relationship is something she actually wants she needs to put in some effort too. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right we don\u2019t know stepdaughter\u2019s motivations, but it also does seem odd that someone who may be struggling to even reach out and reply to one of OP\u2019s emails suddenly wants her over at her house for a whole week.

On one hand this could be an opportunity to actually have a relationship with the daughter (it could also just be a ploy to get a week work of free babysitting), but at the same time if she leaves for an extended period of time she risks undoing a lot of the 3 years of work she\u2019s put in to helping this parrot", "People are throwing around how she didn\u2019t talk to her for years.

The step daughter has a socially acceptable reason to ask for help with an activity that is traditionally mother-daughter.

And rewarding. The smaller birds are much easier to care for, for obvious reasons. The larger birds (parrots of varying shapes and sizes) are far more challenging.

A large cage to sleep in is a must. My mom lets her African Gray out in the morning when she gets up and he follows her around the house as she does things. He has his special snacks and toys and humans that he tolerates, but he\u2019s absolutely bonded to my mom. They\u2019re a huge responsibility and are usually a minimum of a 30-40 year commitment (depending on how old the bird is when you get it), and most are known to live up to 80 years in captivity. So, the best way I can think of to describe it is - if you\u2019re willing to look after a toddler for a few decades, go for it. You will LOVE having a bird. If not\u2026 go for the smaller birds - finches and the like.", "It's very sweet of you to do this.", "This is what I\u2019ve heard! I recently fell down a rabbit hole on YouTube and apparently budgies/parakeets are the easiest.

I give mad props to the people who do it though because they are beautiful birds who deserve all that love.", "They are, and it\u2019s super fun when they start repeating words back to you. Iggy (my mom\u2019s African Gray) has a set routine that he likes. Up and out by 8 or 9 am and running around the house all day, chasing after my mom. By about 7 pm, he\u2019s asking to go to bed. He toddle into the room and say \u201cwanna go to bed?\u201d and that\u2019s mom\u2019s cue to set him up in his seriously oversized cage for the night. \ud83d\ude06 Spoiled rotten, he is, and he loves it.\n\nSmaller birds are just as rewarding as the larger, but they absolutely require less intensive care. If you\u2019re up for it, I would suggest trying with one or two small birds. They\u2019re a joy to be around. For the most part. lol"]}
