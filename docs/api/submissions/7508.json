{"id": 7508, "submission_id": "10dttwx", "title": "AITA for prioritising my parrot over my stepdaughters wedding?", "selftext": "So I'm the owner of a wonderful rescued macaw. She is a wonderful bird but has a lot of issues due to an abusive former home. I've had her for 3 years and since then haven't taken any vacations or trips away as it would be too disruptive for her. She distrusts everyone and is very reliant on her routine. I love her deeply and I'm happy to make sacrifices for her. They are permanent toddlers and very intelligent birds.\n\nI met my husband by the time his kids were older, my stepdaughter was 16 at the time. We married when she moved away for college. Nevertheless I thought we'd managed to have a decent relationship, until now... my stepdaughter is getting married in March, and naturally there's a lot of preparation involved. They're wanting a huge traditional wedding and she is stressed out of her mind. They live out of state, and she invited me recently to come visit her for a week to help make wedding plans and spend time with their 2yo. I declined and she insisted to know why, acting very hurt, and I explained the parrot... Well jt all went downhill from there. \n\nShe caused a massive fuss with her dad, saying she never got a mother figure and I never accepted her as my full blood daughter and this is the ultimate snub for a silly animal. That I'm cold and emotionless... I feel really hurt and I can tell he agrees with her even though he's refusing to take sides. But I don't see why I should be expected to take holiday time off work to babysit and \"bond\" all of a sudden and I don't see how I'm a monster for this... am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: context of our relationship, we don't usually talk at all and she hasn't visited home in 4 years.\n\nEdit 2: Beginning to think it was maybe a mistake posting this. Mostly because this is a real and nuanced situation and reddit is no place for nuance, and maybe personal relationships shouldn't be judged in the AH context in the first place. But also because I should be more understanding and a bigger person regardless of who is or isn't the asshole. Life is too short to be butthurt and offended.\n\nI called my stepdaughter and told her that I understand this is a big moment in her life and she wants someone there to help and support her, and that I'm still willing to help her in any way I can to plan the wedding via zoom and virtually. We talked a bit and I asked her why she hadn't accepted me reaching out in the past and she apologised and said she didn't want to accept someone as a stand-in, \"fake\" replacement for her bio mom, but now she regrets it and would like a closer relationship, especially seeing how close her SO is with his mom. We ended the conversation positively and I'm hoping things can improve going forward. I told her I'm a crazy bird lady and asked her if she still wants a relationship knowing that and she said that after the wedding she's willing to travel to visit us if we have room... which we do. I'll leave this post up but I'm happy either way and I'm glad the feedback here motivated me to make the call.", "created_utc": 1673906532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dttwx/aita_for_prioritising_my_parrot_over_my/", "score": 12015, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's going to be a multi-day trip...", "I was leaning to a NAH judgement but then I read your edit and comments on how the stepdaughter has only spoken to you 5 times in 4 years and that's been through your husband. The bird is a factor but overall, your stepdaughter is probably looking to use you as free childcare and is now trying to guilt you into coming for the week by moaning on how she needs a mother now more than ever to your husband.\n\nYou have tried to maintain a relationship with her from what your comments say while she's given you the bare minimum.\n\nMy judgement is NTA. Tell your husband that the bird isn't the issue, it's his daughter suddenly wanting a relationship which seems to only be to use you as a babysitter she doesn't need to pay.", "I actually agree with both sides but you need to sit down and decide what your stepdaughter is to you. Do you want her to call you grandma? Do you want to be around your grandkids? Do you want her in your life?\n\nI don\u2019t agree with dropping everything for a week but what\u2019s preventing you from doing zoom calls and being a part online? From what you wrote, you aren\u2019t even trying to be involved. That\u2019s ok, it\u2019s your choice, but it will change your relationship with your husband, stepkid and grandchild. Is it worth that? Cause those are humans that will support you til you die. Your parrot, while extremely important, will not give you a life outside their cage. \n\nI\u2019m gonna say NAH as long as you figure out what you want for the future and set clear and appropriate boundaries.", "If you had no parrot, would you have said yes? If not, then the bird has nothing to do with it. If you don't want to go for a week, that's fine but just say so. It doesn't sound like you all have much of a close relationship to begin with. On the flip side, if she really only wanted you to come to babysit, she should have also been honest about that as well.", "NTA potentially destroying years worth of work doesnt sound worth spending a week with people who never talk to you", "NTA. Just because you didn\u2019t meet her unspoken expectations doesn\u2019t mean you owe your step-daughter anything.  People who don\u2019t get it never will. Some people think pets are possessions.", "Question. Are you literally never going to leave the bird ever again? If so that is not healthy", "Need more info.  I'm not sure what \"distrusts everyone and is very reliant on her routine\" means.  Is there no way you can start transitioning your husband to handle its care while you're away?", "NTA\n\nYou didn't help raise this person. You weren't married to her dad until she was an adult and went to college.\n\nIf your step daughter really wants to have a bonded relationship with you, she's got a funny way of going about it. Demanding you come help her with her giant wedding then having a tantrum when you're not available.\n\nAlso, she's NOT your \"full-blood\" daughter, so why would you have to accept her as that? The fact that she \"never got a mother figure\" is not your fault, it's her bio-mother's fault. Sounds like she's taking that out on you.", "You are still going to the wedding, however, correct?  You didn't decline attending the wedding, did you?  I'm assuming that it's just the extended time away from the bird for a full-week that you cannot do, but you can manage to miss a few days for the wedding.  If that is the case, then you are not an a-hole, but if you are missing the week of preparation AND the wedding because of your pet, this makes you an a-hole.\n\nIf my assumption is correct and you are not an a-hole, and your stepdaughter is only now seeking your involvement due to needing a babysitter, and in the past has not involved you in things, and so this \"ask\" feels out of character, then you not being available is permissible and \"the why\" doesn't matter.  It could have been that you didn't have the vacation days to spare with the wedding and other future plans.\n\nHer claiming you are putting an animal ahead of her is no worse than her using you for babysitting under the pretense of \"bonding.\"", "NTA, you can choose to do what you want with your life. Put up boundaries if they serve you, but understand when reciprocal boundaries are deployed.  Offer to help virtually, but this definitely sounds like a free babysitting play", "Info  You kind of contradict yourself as to your motives. You decline to go because of the bird. But then you bemoan that you would have to take time off in order to \u201cbabysit and bond.\u201d Those are very different reasons. If someone you were close to was having a wedding out of state, would you made accommodations for the bird and attend the weddings?  If you didn\u2019t have the bird would you agree to taking the time off for your stepdaughter\u2019s wedding?  Are you not going solely because you have to take care of the bird? Or is your relationship with your stepdaughter also factoring into your decision?", "Wow. All you people who are saying that OP is the a h. She met stepdaughter\u2019s dad when the girl was 16. Not 6! Then the stepdaughter went to college 2-3 years later. How much bonding do you think they did? Y\u2019all keep saying OP is the only mother figure she had, while we don\u2019t really know about the girl\u2019s actual mother. It\u2019s more likely that the girl thinks of OP as \u2018Dad\u2019s wife and not my mom\u2019. \nHow many of you would leave their \u201cpresshus furbaby\u201d who has separation anxiety in order to drop things for a week, to help provide free childcare to someone? \n\nSome redditors be crazy. \n\nOP, you are NTA. Your bird has suffered neglect for 15 years, and if it doesn\u2019t trust anyone else, I also wouldn\u2019t leave it to stress and starve.", "NAH I can understand both sides. Maybe your stepdaughter thought wedding preps were a great way to bond with you albeit your relationship seems politely distanced aside from that. At the same time, I'm an animal person. I've cared for animald, I've had pets, and I get it. I just get that you don't want to leave the bird alone. Throwing away three years of progress would frel horrible. At the same time though, maybe try to find people (women) who are also accustomed to taking care of birds so you have someone to take care of her if you have to go somewhere. Some things aren't voluntary. If you get into an accident, the bird is alone, if somebody else needs you to go somewhere urgently for a few days, you can't go.", "NTA\n\nIn terms of you two bonding it sounds like she maybe didn\u2019t put in effort for it either. To not come home for 4 years and you two not talk much after this many years of knowing each other makes it equal fault. Because it\u2019s equal fault, she has no right to flip her lid about it. She can\u2019t just accuse and blame you solely for the relationship that\u2019s missing. She should\u2019ve communicated nicely, and she should\u2019ve started sooner. \n\nNow she might be trying to create a bond after not having it before, but she needs to accept if you don\u2019t want or don\u2019t care to. She needs to be understanding in general. I don\u2019t know birds but I\u2019m sure some compromise could be found if it was her wedding DAY. Not planning it. It doesn\u2019t sound like you want to go, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019d be against it if the bird wasn\u2019t a factor. Meaning why is she really wanting your help? If you aren\u2019t that close?\n\nNot to mention it\u2019s her wedding? She and her fianc\u00e9 should be figuring the pieces out. If they can\u2019t do it then maybe it\u2019s not meant to be imo. She can call you, or FaceTime, or zoom with you to try to talk more, to get your opinions on wedding things, but you don\u2019t really owe her help. If you two aren\u2019t close IMO you don\u2019t owe her that. \n\nI get some lowkey vibes that she has had resentment towards you for a while and is quick to anger when issues arise with you? Idk what the story was before with her mother but imo you\u2019re not her biological mother and it sounds like the bond isn\u2019t there. If you two really want a bond start communicating otherwise you don\u2019t owe her anything. She sounds like she needs to grow up, and stop aiming her anger at sources that didn\u2019t cause it. \n\nShe aimed her anger from her stress at her dad to attack you. She\u2019s not communicating and she\u2019s not being mature. If she was she\u2019d accept why you can\u2019t go and shut up and get on with her life and her plans. \n\nHer losing it and causing the drama makes you NTA from the context given.", "I'd normally say you were an asshole for putting a bird before family, but you've made it clear she's been pretty distant with you. \n\nThe thing about realtionships (*all* realtionships) is they require effort and attention. Just because you're related (by blood or law) doesn't mean someone is entitled to your presence, especially if the realtionship isn't exactly a good one.\n\nYou aren't the asshole. I assume if your realtionship were better, you'd make more of an effort. You're still going, so it isn't like you're *skipping* the wedding.\n\nNTA, I don't blame you.\n\nEdit: also, my sister has twins and more often than not, \"spending time\" with the kids means baby sitting them, this doesn't sound like a vacation, but a desire to put you to work.", "NTA- macaws and parrots are not just \u201cbirds\u201d like budgies where you can ask a pet sitter to feed and water them all week. Macaws are like gifted children who scream and can rip your fingers off. They are a 80 year commitment and often only bond to a single person. Birds in general are extremely sensitive to any environmental changes so someone who doesn\u2019t know what they are doing can hurt or even kill the macaw.\n\nShame on everyone for saying \u201cchoosing an animal over family\u201d like it\u2019s a bad thing. The macaw seems more like family than her step daughter.  If it was that big of a deal then step daughter would help make accommodations rather than just want a baby sitter.", "NTA. This is an adult woman wanting you to drop everything to help her plan her wedding and watch her kid when you don\u2019t really have a relationship? The bird is entirely beside the point.", "NTA. speaking from experience, caring for pets with PTSD is a whole other thing that people don't really understand unless they've got experience. i have cats, i imagine it might be worse with a parrot. stepdaughter calls it a \"silly animal\"-- it's family. pets are family. your stepdaughter must not have ever had a pet. also it seems like she just wants you to come over to be free childcare while she makes wedding plans-- \"help make wedding plans and spend time with their 2yo\". i wish you and your parrot well!", "I\u2019m going with NTA but with some advice having been someone who was \u201cgrounded\u201d by a fur baby for several years.\n\nFirst, it sounds like DIL is just looking to use you since there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a relationship outside of this wedding when she all of a sudden needs free help. \n\nSecond, I also was grounded from my elderly cat who passed last September. He was my first baby since 2008 and had gotten a lot of health issues and was on multiple medications due to hyperthyroidism and losing too much weight from not eating enough. It was insanely stressful and the level of personal responsibility I felt over his life caused me to not vacation for four years. I did have to travel for work occasionally though and had my husband well taught on caring for him in my absence. I had to TRUST my husband to do it and let go of the need for control, and he honestly did a great job. M\n\nMy point? You could leave the care of the bird in your husband\u2019s hands. You need a back up. Parrots live a very long time and you will hate your life if you never figure out a way to have a break here and there.", "Eeerrrr\n\nAnyone else feel like the AITA post titles are a bit \u2026.. off (if I am being generous; cuckoo was the word that really came to mind)", "YTA and you can say goodbye to any relationship with your step daughter. She hasn\u2019t visited in 4 years? Well have you? Also there was a pandemic for most of that and people weren\u2019t travelling, plus she was pregnant then had a baby. You\u2019re selfish and I disagree with all the NTA.", "Based on your comments, this isn\u2019t *really* about the bird, because you\u2019re willing to find a solution for the bird for the wedding. So you have someone you trust to take care of the bird. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to help with wedding planning or watching the kids. It\u2019s not enough of a priority to you to get help with the bird. I\u2019m not sure that really makes you an asshole, but I understand completely why your stepdaughter is upset. She wanted to involve you in a really important milestone and you rejected that. \n\nYTA for blaming it solely on the bird.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t get to decide whether or not your excuse is \u2018good enough\u2019. \n\nAlso, it sounds like she wants some free work from someone she\u2019s not that close to. That\u2019s expecting too much.", "NTA - while I think you shouldn\u2019t put your entire life on hold for the bird, that\u2019s a decision you made so if you miss events that\u2019s something you\u2019ll need to deal with. I\u2019m more stuck on how you\u2019re expected to drop everything for two weeks when you two aren\u2019t super close (even more so with your edit).", "NTA: I do not think you are an asshole at all for your position. It sounds like from your post, neither of you wanted to have a parental relationship and didn\u2019t frankly have the time to build one when she moved to college.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly telling that she thinks that insulting you will get you to bond in that type of relationship. It\u2019s sounds like that this is news to you that she was looking for a mother figure despite you meeting her as an adult.\n\nShe invited you. You are not a dog that you can summon to do any tasks. Invitation are just invitations. They are not summons nor demands.  She cannot demand to ask you to be a wedding planner and child care.\n\nThen when you decline respectfully because you are responsible for pets who rely on you. She insults you. \n\nIf your husband her father is so worried about the stress of planning the wedding then he should go be wedding planner and child care. Not demand you do that. \n\nPlus from your comments. She did not to suggest she wanted that bond. Mother and daughter relationships require more than 4 or 5 calls over a span of years. In a healthy relationship they would talk more than that during the year.\n\nThis reeks of entitlement on your stepdaughter part", "Unless you know parrots in general (and how people finicky they can be, especially abused ones), this isn't an animal you can simply drop off at a pet sitter. OP could lose the previously abused birds trust if the bird thinks OP had abandoned them. \n\nSame time, you are already associating \\*bonding\\* as being a free babysitter. Also, a last minute one at that. Maybe it's true, maybe it's not. Just sounded a little callous, but then again you are NOT obligated to be her babysitter. NTA.", "I don\u2019t think your stepdaughter is as upset by the fact you declined her invitation as she is your reason why.  Did you tell her the parrot was your only reason for declining?  Did you also mention you needed to clear it with your boss first?  \n\nI am assuming you are a responsible pet parent.  This means the parrot has a regular veterinarian.  Most vets have boarding facilities for pets.  They kinda have to in case the pet needs overnight stays due to illness or surgery.", "NTA - she doesn\u2019t usually speak to you or take time out to get to know you but all of a sudden she wants you to come for a week and spend time with her and her 2 year old? Sounds fishy. I can\u2019t imagine asking someone to take a full week out to spend with me that I usually don\u2019t engage with in that manner.", "NTA", "NTA - she wants a free live in baby sitter for a week. You can\u2019t not visit for 4 years and not call then expect someone to drop everything. Life doesn\u2019t work that way.", "NTA. She's planning on using you for free childcare, and honestly sounds very entitled.", "NTA as long as you're not skipping the wedding. \n\nPeople getting married get one day that is solely about them. Not a bunch of free wedding planning and child care labour for a week. Not sure why everyone gets so entitled about wedding expectations but it's ridiculous to expect more than showing up to celebrate the wedding day unless the person WANTS to help more. Asking sure, but respect the no if you get one in response.\n\nFor context, I'm engaged and currently planning a 60-65 person wedding.", "NTA. I don't like birds. But you get to choose what you do with your time. It'd be nice if you went, but you want to keep a stable home for a traumatized pet. A lot of comments are saying \"it's just a BIRD who cares?\" What if it was a dog in the same circumstances? What if you rescued a dog from fighting pits? No one would give you shit because most people can sympathize with dogs. You love this bird like family and it sounds like she is only taking her own needs into account, maybe even just banking on free childcare. Don't let people bully you into doing something you're not comfortable with.", "Nah because I understand both sides. \n\nPeople will never grasp that animals, like humans, can and do have different needs and I understand how hard it is with abused animals. \nYour parrot can't just be cared for by anybody. \nOn top of that, stressing yourself and him out for a stepdaughter that, up until this point, has wanted no relationship with you, I wouldn't either. \n\nOn that same token, your step daughter doesn't understand that and that's fair. It's totally understandable for her to be so upset.", "You are the bird's mate, period. Yes, it's very difficult for you to go away. Your commitment will be years long (but you know that, of course... just filling in for others). You'll get a lot of y-t-a-s from people that don't know much about those types of birds.\n\nThe invitation was very kind on her part. She reached out to you.

If you two never talk and she hasn\u2019t even been home in 4 years I don\u2019t get why she turned to you now. Doesn\u2019t she have MOH or bridesmaids whose role is to help with the wedding? I\u2019m in two minds about your birdie because I know I\u2019d be dead worried about leaving my dog for that long as he has separation anxiety and abandonment issues, while I also suffer with anxiety. But you also should start working on helping your birdie become a bit more independent. It\u2019s been a slow journey for my dog and I but small steps help. Someone suggested you go see your stepdaughter for a few days rather than 2 weeks. That seems like a good starting point.", "NTA, because it sounds like she was trying to get free childcare and labor out of you rather than wanting bonding time.  Your title made it sound like you'd be missing the wedding.  You definitely need to go to the wedding, because at that point you're taking it too far putting the bird over family.\n\nMaybe offer if there's anything you can do to help prepare from home, if that's something you want to do.\n\nETA: if you are going to make sure to make it to the wedding, you need to clarify that in the post, because I think a lot of people are reading this as you saying you won't be going to the wedding.", "**NTA.** You shouldn\u2019t be expected to put your life aside for somebody who hasn\u2019t even visited in four years. Now that she needs help she chooses to pull this guilt trip over her needing a mother figure? No. Stay with your baby bird who is devoted to you. Fuck that", "NTA, to be honest the parrot sounds like much more likable than the stepdaughter. The stepdaughter sounds like she is looking for a babysitter for a week and even though has no real relationship with you, decided that you will do in looking after her kid. I guess her father can't do this because, reasons.", "I guess this one boils down to what kind of a future relationship you want with your stepdaughter and grandchildren.  If you don\u2019t really care about them, then go right ahead and prioritize your bird.  Personally YTA for the line about her not visiting in 4 years\u2026so the fact that she was pregnant then with a 1-2 year old doesn\u2019t grant her grace for not visiting more often?  Stuff like this rips families apart.  Think about what you want the future to look like.", "So blame it on your lack of relationship, not on your parrot. YTA", "Meh. Sounds like you're using the bird as an excuse to get out of things you don't want to do.\n\nYou don't want to bond or to hang out with their kid. She knows. Your husband knows. Not sure why you're blaming the bird. YTA for that. It seems like it's gone through enough.", "So she's shown NO interest in you in the last 4 years but suddenly wants you to come out for a week to help her with her wedding planning? This is a hard one. That bird's gonna live forever and you can't use it to get out of things you don't want to do forever. I dunno, OP. You can't not have a life forever because of this bird. Maybe you could go for a long weekend.  \n\n\nESH I guess", "I guess I need more information because right now I\u2019m leaning YTA. Are you planning to literally never travel anywhere or go on vacation until this bird dies? You say it\u2019s about not wanting to disrupt your parrot\u2019s routine but it *sounds* more like you don\u2019t want to take vacation time and you\u2019re not interested in bonding with your stepdaughter.", "NTA!!!! The people saying y-t-a are pricks man. Y'all are a bunch of teens who don't understand adult responsibility and have clearly never worked with animals - particularly special needs animals - before. As far as OP's side goes, we understand that the step-daughter hadn't ever really expressed an interest in having a relationship, which is fine. She probably accepted that she's the stepmom to an older child and that they don't have that sort of connection. But now, all of the sudden, the stepdaughter wants a full week of childcare and labor? Huh? I don't think I could manage that for some of my closest people to me, not in this economy. \n\nParrots are difficult birds to find sitters for. Especially one with an abused past. I've done a lot of sitting for special needs animals, whose owners hadn't gone on vacation in a decade because no one was qualified to help out. Birds are more than just feeding them and cleaning their cage. Like she said, they're large, intelligent toddler-esque creatures. She's not not attending the ceremony!! It's not that she's not going at all or taking any time to come visit. She just doesn't want to leave her bird - who has grown highly reliant on her for routine and support - alone in their home for an entire week, being taken care of by potential strangers. Also, would it be great to have friends and fam pitch in time and energy to help with the wedding planning and prep? Of course. I'm planning on asking around for assistance on my own wedding. I wouldn't have the entitlement and audacity to be pissed off and offended if they declined, for ANY reason. If everything in OP's post is true, and details aren't being intentionally left out, then the stepdaughter is one entitled chick. I get she's stressed about the wedding, that's fair. But she doesn't get to go around making demands of people like that. Being a bride doesn't make you no grand pubah of nothing.", "NTA, but I understand why daughter might be upset. I don't know much about birds but is there anything you can do, mb plan the trip to her that wouldn't be soon and in the meantime try to introduce your parrot to someone who is a woman, has experience with birds and can \"babysit\"? Bc it sounds like your stepdaughter could really use your help and support, but I also understand it's important for an abused animal to have a routine and I don't think you can take them with you. But even if you're not going now, having someone who can take care of your parrot and with whom they'll be comfortable with is important in case anything happens to you and also for their health.

They're wanting a huge traditional wedding and she is stressed out of her mind. They live out of state, and she invited me recently to come visit her for a week to help make wedding plans and spend time with their 2yo. I declined and she insisted to know why, acting very hurt, and I explained the parrot... Well jt all went downhill from there. \n\nShe caused a massive fuss with her dad, saying she never got a mother figure and I never accepted her as my full blood daughter and this is the ultimate snub for a silly animal.

They will groom and cuddle all day, also do the nasty lol. But that's what parrots are naturally meant to do, have you built any outdoor access for her?

It may help the perspective of the situation.", "INFO\n\nReading what you wrote and the comments that you wrote... it appears that your commitment to the bird's full recovery is your number 1 priority in life.  And that's fine; I wouldn't criticize that.\n\nIf I were your stepdaughter, and only knew you a little bit for two years and you moved in when I moved out... it would probably be a bit hard for me to figure out how to relate to you.  And as a 18 year old, I'd probably look toward your actions to figure out if you had any interest in me as a person.\n\nI've known a lot of step situations... both with the children living home and when they're older.  Its pretty much the norm that the step parent has little to no interest in step children, especially if they're grown.\n\nSo its very possible that while you were busy with the bird, your step daughter internalized the message that you weren't available/interested.\n\n(As a side note, my adoptive from birth mother? when I'd call home she'd monologue about politics and sports and then say 'okay, here's your dad'... without ever giving me a chance to say anything to her, or asking me a single question about how i was doing.  If my experience sounds familiar to you...)\n\nAnd you weren't available.  How could you have traveled when you first had the bird?  Between COVID, and it not being safe for the bird's mental health for you to leave her (the bird) alone... would it have made sense to invite you?\n\n(As a second aside, how are you going to make sure the bird is okay for the wedding?  Do you have someone who can provide adequate care?).\n\nI'm also feeling from your write up and comments that you're not interested in this step daughter... but that instead of just admitting you're not interested, you want to find ways to blame her for there not being a relationship.  It's just better to admit (at least to yourself) that you married the man, but that you waited for the children to be gone because they didn't interest you.  A very large majority of step parents feel this way.  Admitting it makes it so that you're less likely to hurt anyone as then everything is on the table.\n\nI think also that when your step daughter complains that she never got a mother figure (i think in comments that you mention that the birth mother was out of the picture by age 6... which... really sucks), that shows that she did spend all that time hoping for something from you... something she never got.  And its normal for step children to want a step parent to fill that void.\n\nSome people can do it; most can't.  Most.  can't.  Being honest about it helps.\n\nAs far as your husband's reaction... I think you should allow him to feel how he feels.  It's good that he's not taking sides, and I would hope that everyone would appreciate that.  Some battles are best to side step.\n\nBut also, he's probably not reacting based on just this week, but on the totality of the relationships over time.\n\nWhat I mean is this: if you didn't have the special needs parrot, how would you have otherwise avoided helping with the wedding?\n\nI ask because, based on everything here... I'm pretty sure that you didn't want to go for anything more than the ceremony.\n\nAnd again, being honest at least to yourself about that is probably a helpful thing.\n\nThere's something about what you wrote and how you phrased things that reminds me of my own \"mom\" who drove out during the week I was having my commissioning in the military and my graduation from college.  Or that's why she told my dad she was coming.  In reality? She went to record shows (she's a collector) and missed both of my events.  I knew already that I meant nothing to her, that there was no relationship, so I found her missing the events a bit funny.  My ex was furious and I would have never told my dad what happened.\n\nMy dad, best I understand the universe, is in Jewish heaven right now.  if I had to talk to him about it (if I died before my mom), then I'd tell him \"Its okay.  After adopting me as a 3 month old, she never bonded to me.  She wasn't able to. Not her fault.  Its okay all the things she missed. She never meant anything by missing them... those events just carried no meaning for her. its okay...", "Regardless of what your stepdaughter's prior interest in a relationship with you was before this, she will always believe - from this decision on - you have no interest in a relationship with her.

I respect and commend your devotion to your macaw and think it\u2019s totally reasonable for you not to be available to your step daughter in the way she\u2019s asked. I can also see why this hurt your step daughter (although I do think she could definitely have handled it better and I hope she comes around). Based on what you say she said to her father about never having a mother figure or being accepted by you, it sounds like she has some typical abandonment trauma. Since weddings are largely considered a very important day in people\u2019s lives, it can bring to the forefront any wounds around important relationships and their role in life milestones. Maybe you declining to be more involved triggered a trauma response in her from her mother wound? I suspect she may have felt rejected and may be feeling the absence of a mother figure in her life really heavily right now leading up to the wedding, and that\u2019s the place she had that reaction from. Obviously I\u2019m not familiar with the dynamics in your family, but as someone with a special interest in psychology and trauma, this is what stands out to me from your story. Maybe what you know about trauma and healing can help you to connect with and support her in a way that doesn\u2019t compromise your commitment to your macaw? If these things are true, maybe a conversation where you affirm to her that you do really care about her, even though you can\u2019t be there in the way she wanted.

Then I saw your edit to your main post. Good on you for taking some of the criticism you received and considering how you can do better - that\u2019s tough stuff!

If you don't know this, then you have no business having exotic pets. I hatched my blue and gold and raised her from a baby she was fully dependent on me. But my local bird store boards birds and I have left her there many times. I have also brought her there many times to go shopping with me or to have her nails done and beak trimmed. She is very used to the store and the people around her. If you are not taking your bird out at least to the bird store to get trimmed and looked after that is on you.

How was her pregnancy? When I was pregnant, I couldn't be in a car unless I was the driver because my motion sickness was so bad.  Did you expect her to put her infant on a plane during a pandemic or drive 12 hours? Because as a mother to a toddler, let me tell you, long car rides with babies and toddlers are awful.

If OP uses that rationale to score keep, well then she will miss opportunities to actually form a bond with her SD.  It's actually situations like these and shared experiences that help people bond or actually form real relationships.  Maybe the SD just wants a free babysitter, but it actually also creates an opportunity for them to develop a real bond.  Sometimes people do come together out of necessity but that actually then creates a foundation to create a genuine relationship.  I have seen this happen at funerals.  Relatives not in communication all of a sudden joined together, reacquainted, realizing how much they have in common and choosing to make an effort going forward.\n\nMaybe this is the only way the SD knows how to make an effort.  She didn't have a mother growing up.  Now there is a wedding and what she is asking OP to do is what you would ask your mother to do...maybe that is actually her attempt.  I mean if she hasn't had much of a relationship with OP for the last 5 years and her kid is 2 years old, I'm assuming she's been fine finding a babysitter for her child up to this point such that she doesn't actually NEED OP to babysit.\n\nI am also assuming by timelines that the SD is still in her 20s.  As someone who is well beyond their 20s, I can assure you people in their 20s are still SO young.  They are adults in name but really still so immature and in need of guidance from parents and loved ones.  The SD is far less mature than OP which to me means greater expectations on OP to be able to forgive and overlook, not score keep and perhaps be able to look beyond the rejection she has felt to realize this is a real opportunity.  If not now, then when?\n\nI personally think she should go...maybe not the whole week given the bird.  Perhaps just the 2 days she thinks is acceptable for the wellbeing of her bird and then again 2 days for the wedding.

During her spay surgery the vet found BBs embedded in her belly skin. :(\n\nAnyway, the only human she really loved and trusted completely was HER human, an old lady who lived down the street. She would try out sitters by having you over for snacks and iced tea and if the cat allowed you to -see- her, that was enough. Touching her? Pipe dream of course, no one except Miss Patty could touch her.\n\nShe tried every teenager, young adult and interested adult in the neighborhood (she left fliers on our door a year prior to her son's wedding... can't say Miss Patty didn't plan ahead!) plus a bunch of people who responded to her bulletin board fliers she left at pet stores, and found two people that Dahlia would allow to look at her. So when the old lady took a weekend away with friends I started as the pet sitter.\n\nThe first SEVEN times I catsat, I did not actually glimpse the cat. I was told not to try to bother her, to clean her litter, clean and refill her water bowl, fill her food and then sit in the living room for \"at least an hour\" quietly in case she wanted attention. And those seven times, she was not seen. But food was disappearing and litterbox was used so I didn't worry.\n\nDuring the wedding (a 5 day trip iirc) I was asked to actually stay at the house because Miss Patty wanted it to look lived in. I was 15 and thought this was really cool and grown up sounding so I accepted. I was making a sandwich the second evening and felt something brush my bare leg. I froze, looked down... and noticed a white speckled tabby cat (vet said her white spots were probably scars? I think that's what Patty told me anyway.) was rubbing herself on my leg.\n\nI extended a hand with a bite of lunch meat as slowly as I was capable of, and she ate it.\n\nAfter that, she would sometimes come out and look at me, or rub herself on my leg when I was around. If I sat on the sofa, she would sit on the loveseat on the other side of the room and look at me.\n\nIt took another three gigs before I was brave enough to touch her, but eventually I could sit on the sofa and crochet and she would tuck herself into my lap and purr at me. Soft stroking was permitted but if I moved too fast, coughed, sneezed, or the winds changed, she would bolt.\n\nI actually brought over my polaroid camera (before cell phones, it was that little flat one that took pictures a little bigger than a stamp, lol) and took a picture of her on my lap so I could prove to Patty that I had been deemed worthy. xD\n\nEventually another teenager, Jim, also was deemed an acceptable sitter, although it took him a lot longer to touch her she let him see her right from the start so it evens out. But when I was moving out of the neighborhood, my neighbor actually cried and told me she would \"never find another sitter for Dahlia!\"\n\nAlthough Jim told me later (we bonded over the cat, we're still social media type kinda-friends) that she did find another sitter a year after I moved, it was a Hispanic lady who spoke almost no English which is how Jim and I found out Patty was/is fluent in Spanish and loved having a new friend to practice with. (To be clear, Patty is a very sweet woman, she wasn't just calling us when she needed a sitter, we'd come out if we saw her come home with groceries to help her carry them in, then she'd give us cake and iced tea. She also would cook you dinner if you didn't make an excuse to leave quickly enough... so if you were in with Patty, you had a real friend in life.)", "A cat adopted us.

My husband and I just got married out of state. And about 2 years prior they adopted a very old sickly dog that needed constant care and that dog was with her 24/7.\n\nAnd yet they managed to find a great caretaker for the dog who was able to give it that level of attention and care it needed while they were gone for my wedding. \n\nI can't imagine my step mom bailing on my wedding because of a pet.\n\nAnd considering my actual life story seems on par with your step daughters, I feel uniquely qualified to give my ruling.", "OP isn't skipping the wedding they are just declining to spend an extended time babysitting the kid.

Part of that is that they require specialized care by people they trust. If they don't trust their carer, they can stop eating, give up in despair, or throw themselves against their enclosure.\n\nAnother part of that is that they are genuinely fragile creatures. Frighteningly fragile. \n\nAnd another part of that high maintenance is that they can easily snip off a finger if they feel threatened. \n\nHaving a bird means you have to work on their schedule and their limitations. Their carers have to work around their needs - and they are exceptionally needy creatures.

OP wants to stay home because of a bird, apparently for the rest of her life too since birds live for-fucking-ever...

Babies are a lot of work too, you know!\n\nAnd in general, I feel like people need to be more forgiving of the decisions that younger people make too. Maybe the daughter wasn't super close to OP when she was younger, but it's hard enough to be a teenager/young adult, and especially difficult to be in that step-situation, and I think you shouldn't hold it against them when they're 25 or 30 and trying to build a relationship with you.\n\nI also disagree with all of these \"she just wants you to be a babysitter\" comments. That's your grandchild, essentially. It's not really \"babysitting\" when it's family like this. I know if I had a kid, my parents would jump at the opportunity to spend a week with them, even if all they did was change shitty diapers for 7 days straight. \n\nThe daughter extended an invitation, she's trying to build a relationship, OP said no.

The parrot is not the only one in the OP's life who was abused, the stepdaughter was abandoned by her bio mom, that kind of emotional neglect/abandonment can cause lifelong emotional damage to people as well. Was the stepdaughter supposed to immediately get over that trauma and take equal responsibility for her relationship with the OP? Or maybe we can realize 2 years is actually a long time when you're only 16? And that healing from childhood trauma takes years if not decades?

Might be something to think about. \n\n\nAlso as the kid who didn't have a mother figure, I get why stepdaughter is hurt. If you can figure out a way to make it work, or even try to meet in the middle she would probably be grateful. Maybe instead of a whole week or two, a day lunch halfway between you two here and there. Video calls. Maybe a trip up to taste test cakes as a training session for your bird.

Don\u2019t know if it made a difference, but I wanted to help them be ok.", "Aww, your poor pup. Something incredibly traumatic happened to him as a pup. I\u2019m happy he\u2019s had an amazing life you with you guys tho. 15 years of unconditional love is a true gift.", "I literally traumatized my dog by leaving him for 6 weeks while I was in a residential psychiatric program. My husband had him the whole time, but poor Puddleglum looked for me every time they went outside, and he snubbed my husband the whole time I was gone. I\u2019ve been home 3 months now, but the poor dog still gets super nervous anytime I leave the house, and he doesn\u2019t put himself to bed anymore, like he did before I left. He just falls asleep next to me on the couch or in my office, until I go to bed.", "perfect", "lmao, he\u2019d have bitten off fingers, toes and quite possibly my nose had I ever tried it. Closest I got was him saying \u201cgood morning, want some juice\u201d when I got up in the morning to work an opening shift for my job. To which I would respond with, \u201cgood morning, yes you can have some juice.\u201d Then I would go to the kitchen and pour myself a small glass of juice and offer him some. \n\nI say cohabitated because you never truly own a bird. However, a bird can absolutely own you. lmao"]}
