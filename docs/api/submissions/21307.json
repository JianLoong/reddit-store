This means it\u2019s next to impossible for me get my kids out of the car and walk across the parking lot without being put in real danger if one of those spots isn\u2019t open. I tried talking to the management and they said that assigned spots are more hassle than they are worth and said to talk directly to the neighbors. \n\nSo I did and basically asked if the spot closest to the door could be \u201creserved\u201d for me. Basically all of them said no, in varying manners of rudeness by the way. My kids are with their dad for his time so I decided to try again without them around since the conversation would be more \u201cadult to adult.\u201d Two of my neighbors didn\u2019t even respond and the third said \u201cyou get one the spots in front often enough, why is this even an issue?\u201d I said I need them all the time as a single mother. He said \u201cyou are a real piece of work for trying to play that card, the other spots are maybe 20 feet further away.\u201d I said it\u2019s not the distance, it\u2019s that I have to have my kids walk across the parking lot.

Walking the additional distance of one or two parking spaces is in no way, shape, or form, an appreciable danger.

You being married wouldn't make an extra bit of walking somehow easier or less \"dangerous.\" You just want to have the prime parking spot and are using it as an excuse.", "It is not a desirable situation that you are in.

How do you navigate those lots with your kids?", "You're obviously having to make a lot of adjustments, but yes, by expecting this, YTA. \n\nThere are lots of situations where , as a parent, you need to make sure that you are watching out for your kids and that you you teach them how to keep themselves safe. You don't say how old your kids are, but even quite mall children can learn that they must stand by the car and wait to hold your hand before running off, and if they can't, or are too young, that's why things such as reins, cars eats that can be carried, and child lock on car door exist. \n\nYour neighbour is correct - learning o cross roads, walk safely in a parking lot etc. *are* life skills and your focus needs to be on teaching your kids how to navigate those things safely. I get it, juggling two kids as a single person can be hard work, especially if you are not used to it, but  thousands of parents do it.  Short term, I'd suggest that you make it a priority to teach your kids that they mustn't leave the side of the car without you / your permission, That way, you can hold their hands and walk with them, so the major risk, t (that they run out in front of a car or that they are not seen as they are shorter) are both limited.\n\nUnfortunately , you will be coming over as pretty entitled to your neighbours, and the fact that all three of them have said no to your demands should be the clue that what you are expecting isn't reasonable.  You're probably lucky that the spaces are not reserved - if they were, it's likely that they would have been allocated on a 'first come, first served; basis and that as the newest resident you would not get to use the spot y the door at all, until one of the longer serving residents moved out and you got a reserved spot.", "A SINGLE MOTHER who also already has a BF mere months after a divorce.

I tried talking to the management and they said that assigned spots are more hassle than they are worth and said to talk directly to the neighbors. \n\nSo I did and basically asked if the spot closest to the door could be \u201creserved\u201d for me. Basically all of them said no, in varying manners of rudeness by the way. My kids are with their dad for his time so I decided to try again without them around since the conversation would be more \u201cadult to adult.\u201d Two of my neighbors didn\u2019t even respond and the third said \u201cyou get one the spots in front often enough, why is this even an issue?\u201d I said I need them all the time as a single mother. He said \u201cyou are a real piece of work for trying to play that card, the other spots are maybe 20 feet further away.\u201d I said it\u2019s not the distance, it\u2019s that I have to have my kids walk across the parking lot. He said \u201cit\u2019s a life skill\u201d and shut the door in my face.\n\nAITA for asking my neighbors to park in different spots so I can have access to the ones close to the building?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
