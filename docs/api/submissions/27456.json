My parents are divorced, so there are 3 different places we could go and everybody wants to see us. My mum also lives alone and struggles with her mental health, so I feel bad leaving her on Christmas.\n\nWe haven't yet spent a single Christmas with Joe's family.\nEach year we have attempted to make arrangements, but it never works out.\nIt's difficult to stay with them for Christmas, as they don't have a spare room in their house. Hotels are expensive around Christmas time, and Joe and I are in agreement that we don't wish to stay in a crappy hotel over Christmas that costs a fortune.\nThe biggest issue is that Joe's family have a very large, territorial and aggressive dog that they struggle to control. When we have visited we have been forced to remain upstairs out of the way as this dog's behaviour is so unpredictable, and any time he's heard us he's lost his shit downstairs.\n\nWe are very fortunate to own a large house with 2 spare double bedrooms. This is perfect for welcoming Joe's family for Christmas.\nJoe has started to make arrangements for his family to come and stay over the holiday this year, which is lovely.\nThe problem is that his family will refuse to come without bringing their dog. I am very concerned about this because:\n- The dog has a history of aggression. I don't want to feel like I can't come downstairs to our kitchen (where he would stay overnight), or be scared just to walk around in my own home.\n- Joe thinks the dog can stay outside in our small garden most of the time, but we can't predict the weather that far in advance, and his barking could disturb our neighbours on Christmas day.\n- I am worried about the safety and wellbeing of my cats. They will feel anxious, and could be torn apart!\n- Everyone will be stressed out trying to control the dog.\n\nI shared my concerns and Joe told me that although he understands why I'm worried, he genuinely doesn't believe this will be a problem.\nHe shared that they plan to bring a large crate to keep the dog in the kitchen, and he can be in our garden, or be out on walks most of the time. I just can't see this logistically working.\n\nJoe has since told me that he already told his family that it won't be a problem (before consulting me). I was obviously upset about this too.\nI don't want to be TA and tell him his family aren't allowed to come for Christmas, especially as we have never spent a Christmas with them. I also don't want his family to think I'm the reason they can't stay if Joe has already told them yes.\n\nWIBTA for telling him that they can't come if they bring their aggressive dog?", "created_utc": 1695470477, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16q2psr/wibta_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_his_family/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou need to put your foot down on this one. Say NO! and mean it. \n\nThere is no reason they can't board the dog in kennels for a few days while they visit. There is no reason for them to bring an aggressive dog in to your home that will likely end up scaring your cats in to running away.\n\nIt has to be a hard no to the dog or they don't come.", "NTA. \n\nThey need to find a solution for the dog before coming. But understand your husband situation  he didnt  spent CHrismas with his family for  years. A dog sitter is needed.", "NTA. If you can\u2019t roam their house because of the dog then that\u2019s a sign of an aggressive animal, IMO. Animals that show aggression as you describe can be unpredictable. Add that in with a new environment and who knows what will happen. Plus it is not fair to an animal to have to be locked up like that. Even more so your concerns about barking at valid for in the yard or in that kennel.\n\nThey should either board their dog, have a close friend the dog is comfortable with come by to care for it, or board the animal if they want to come visit. \n\nAs it is both of y\u2019all\u2019s house and you have animals then he shouldn\u2019t be making the decision alone. He has to be considerate of you and vice versa. Talk it out and find the compromise.", "NTA. You should be able to feel safe and comfortable in your own home.\n\n>Joe has since told me that he already told his family that it won't be a problem (before consulting me).\n\nThat's not how things should be done. He shouldn't be surprised if you spend Christmas elsewhere.", "NTA.\n\nI want to focus first on the part where your partner made the decision that this arrangement was okay for both of you, but without consulting you and while knowing it was making you uncomfortable. Taking away your voice is not a partnership. I would probably spend more time wanting to talk about that to be honest.\n\nIt is not common for people visiting family for the holidays to bring their pets with them. It doesn\u2019t matter the reason and you don\u2019t need to search for one in order to be able to simply say that you are not comfortable with that. If you wanted to go the extra step to offer a doggy daycare or local pet sitting solution you certainly can, but ultimately it is their responsibility to make arrangements for their pet or decide not to travel.", "NTA\nEven if you would be \"I just don't want a dog in my house\" this is enough to not let a dog into your house. You should feel comfortable in your own space. You said that this dog is agrresive so they should really consider dog hotel or dogsitter. And as i understand you want his family to come stay over so it's not like separating him from family.\nFor 15 years I always had someone petsit my dog because my family doesn't wanted him during Christmas. And he was 16 pound sweetheart and still it's reasonable to just don't want him in their house...\nThey can choose a pet hotel in your city if they don't want him to stay behind .", "NTA.  Even in a short-term guest scenario, nobody enters your house to stay overnight unless hubby and wife both agree in advance.  Which means, any individual (husband, or wife) has veto power over any plans for visitors to stay overnight.", "NTA\n\nInsisting on bringing your pets to someone else's home is rude. Not wanting a problematic dog in your house is also not unreasonable.", "NTA. The dog needs to stay at a kennel or at home with a dog sitter. It\u2019s not fair to the dog to be forced to stay outside in the garden. His family failed that dog by never getting him properly trained. I wouldn\u2019t let an aggressive dog in my house and I love dogs.", "NTA. He needs to tell his family \"no\" about the dog and be firm. Op, please have a place to go if they show up with the dog. I have a feeling neither your husband nor his family cares what you think. They will bring the dog anyway because your husband told them it was ok. \n\nHonestly, you have a huge husband problem.", "NTA. Normally you should definitely have them over, but the dog totally changes everything. Why can't they do something else with him?\n\nYour best solution is probably to suck it up and get a hotel room near them, so at least you don't have the dog tearing up your house and threatening your cats.", "Tell them you want the dog muzzled when he is out of the crate in the house and thats a deal breaker . Your house, your rules.", "Has the dog ever bitten anyone? Is he actually aggressive or just scared?   A aggressive dog is actually pretty rare a scared aggressive dog is fairly common. Take the time for the dog to know you.   \n\nIf they can\u2019t handle the dog at all he either gets crated all the time (which will actually make it worse) or he stays home.", "Info: can the dog stay with a muzzle on whilst he\u2019s outside the crate? Can the dog be supervised at all times as a boundary you\u2019ll enforce?", "Yta you have had the privilege of spending Christmas with your family every year even though it should have been switched of. And your partner and his family compromised by having them make the trip. Instead you should have ground rules for the dog ie staying in the create and or anytime he needs to be out he should have to wear a muzzle.

I was struggling with this, especially because of the cats.\n\nBut the comments about \"his barking could disturb our neighbours on Christmas day\" is what decided it for me.\n\nThis doesn't seem like a real reason. This seems like you're throwing stuff around to see what will stick. Especially when you pre-empted the actual story talking about how you're worried about your mother's mental health. \n\nIt paints a picture of you looking for a reason l, any reason, to not be with Joe's family. \n\nOr if you're with someone you truly think will put your cats in a position to \"be torn apart!\" leave him.\n\nYes I know that could happen, but if he's so casual about it then he's clearly a bad egg.", "Absolutely NTA. The dog can be boarded.", "Nta - the dog can be boarded over the holidays.", "This is a very reasonable boundary. Even if the dog were perfectly behaved it would totally reasonable. He needs to tell his family that the dog is not allowed.", "NTA. Call them and tell them Joe didn't run it by you and while they are welcome, the dog is not. If they show up with the dog, take your cats and go somewhere else. This is a disaster waiting to happen. The immediate physical danger trumps all personal feelings in the matter. If your partner gets upset, well you know where you stand on his priority list.", "YWBTA\n\nIt's not fair that you don't even try when you won't go there. \n\nThat's all there is to it. If it doesn't work, well then you know it doesn't work. \n\nBut at this point you are making it all about you and your cats and selfishly acting like it's just fine that he never gets to spend Christmas with his family.", "NTA. If you couldn't even go downstairs while in their home, that dog is unpredictable and dangerous. I would be worried about your cats too.\n\nAnd the cats are the excuse, not you. \"I'm so sorry Joe said it would be all right, he didn't consider the cats when he told you that. I'm really sorry, but we can't risk having your dog here because of them. Please find a kennel or a dog sitter so you can still come!\"", "No kennel is going to deal with that.", "If the dog has a high prey drive it could unfortunately do much more then hurt OP\u2019s cats.

He is therefore very wary of strangers and protective of his female owner, but I think unfortunately this has been allowed and/or rewarded in the past.", "Scared is worse IMO. Scared aggression is unpredictable. Straight up aggression, they warn you.", "Wearing a muzzle indoors sounds the best & safest solution tbh", "Thanks for the comment. Just to explain my reasoning (I wrote a much longer post initially but it went over the character limit!)\n\nMy thoughts on this were that if I was trying to enjoy my Christmas and my neighbours locked their dog in the garden barking away then I would be very frustrated. I was more trying to consider the wellbeing of everyone on my street. If \"we could just shut the dog outside most of the time\" was the solution to the dog being in the house, I was concerned that this would cause conflict with our neighbours.\n\nAlso I definitely don't think my partner would deliberately put my cats in a position where they could be harmed, but I do have a very curious and slightly dim ragdoll cat who has no concept of danger lol. The likelihood of him strolling into his own kitchen if the door was accidentally left open and then being attacked by the dog are quite high.", "It's what you pay them for!", "That\u2019s the shits honestly. I\u2019m sorry but that dog should either go for training or be put down it is just a liability waiting for a place to happen.   We adopted a dog almost exactly what you are describing but we took for training and was good. Sounds like the dog has had to be the boss and they will be the boss.  Look up Brian killcommons (I think that\u2019s how you spell it) in dog training a very excellent way to train your dog. Get them one of his books for Christmas maybe they will get the hint", "Yes when you hear the deep belly growl of a aggressive dog that means business you won\u2019t forget it.   Straight up aggression is what it is you know what is going on and what will trigger it.  Scared aggression is just reactive to the environment", "I get on well with Joe's family and would very much like to welcome them... just without the aggressive, terrifying and loud doggo \ud83d\udc36", "They are not paid to deal with dangerous aggressive animals with a known bite history. Not safe for the staff, not safe for the other boarders, and not safe for the aggressive animal. Full stop. \n\nOf course they could try to be assholes and lie, saying there's no behavior problems. That's why a lot of boarding facilities want to meet your dog before they agree to take you on as a client.\n\nBest option would be to have someone the dog knows check on it in its own house, but the history of break ins freaking the dog out makes that problematic too.\n\nBottom line, this dog is a dangerous liability. Bringing it into OP's home, even if you keep all the animals separate and keep a basket muzzle on the dog, cats could end up so stressed they start peeing everywhere, and now OP has a different difficult animal behavior to deal with. \n\nThis is bad several ways. The parents are assholes for allowing the behavior to continue this long. Dog needs professional help like years ago.", "Get them the book absolutely", "What I would take away from this is that if you provide a list of reasons for something, only list the strong reasons or people will fixate on the weakest.\n\nThe dog being aggressive is a good enough reason all on its own. You wanting to be safe and comfortable in your home is good enough, too.\n\n\"The dog might hypothetically bark outside on a holiday\" starts to sound like you're trying to offer up a smorgasbord of reasons in hopes that your husband might pick one that he'll respect. \n\nThe first two items were already worthy of being respected.", "Then go to the pet store, buy some large raw bones. Dog will be outside quietly entertained  chewing on the bones", "With all that has been in the news recently about dangerous dog breeds. I think it's fair to say, bad owners make dogs dangerous.", "It's always been the breed of human that's the problem, but that's really not relevant here. Dog has a history of trauma, is reactive, is owner protective, has a bite history against people it lives with. I really don't care what breed it is."]}
