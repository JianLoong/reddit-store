Hotels are expensive around Christmas time, and Joe and I are in agreement that we don't wish to stay in a crappy hotel over Christmas that costs a fortune.\nThe biggest issue is that Joe's family have a very large, territorial and aggressive dog that they struggle to control. When we have visited we have been forced to remain upstairs out of the way as this dog's behaviour is so unpredictable, and any time he's heard us he's lost his shit downstairs.\n\nWe are very fortunate to own a large house with 2 spare double bedrooms.

Use strong language in describing your apprehension, focus on your own feelings and highlight the events in the past which led you to feel this way, don't allow your feelings to be dismissed. But stop short of dishing ultimatums. Suggest that he talks to his family about making arrangements for the dog, explore options for addressing your concerns - there may be options you haven't considered. Give him the opportunity to come up with a solution.

There have been a number of reasons it hasn't worked out, most of them have actually been his family's decision and not ours.", "I'm in the UK... definitely not a possibility here!", "I would agree, Go to your Mum's if your BF won't say no dog to them.", "I would be very concerned about this.", "Heck no ,he gets to take his family and find some place to go, not OP", "THIS. The first thing I thought was these cats are in DANGER.", "Yes! This dog is going to kill those poor kitties. I can't believe they're even having this discussion, I'm genuinely scared for the cats. I hope that if this somehow gets forced on them they will find another place for the cats to stay or even board them in a kennel. This is really upsetting.", "This. The dog sounds aggresive enough that it would use a cat as a chew toy. Those cats deserve to feel safe in their own home.\n\nAnd how is that dog guna react in a forgein environment? Could attack her or him. Destroy the house. Escape and attack an innocent bystander.\n\nIve always wanted a black cat but i have two jack russells one of which hates cats so i know its a no no", "My dog can't be around other dogs so his trainer boards dogs. One of the only people who could handle my dog, and yes it is much more pricey than a kennel but it's what we have to deal with! Hopefully OPs in laws can look into something like this just in general", "And good luck finding a dog sitter willing to put up with that.", "We've had family members in the past tell us we can one or both of our dogs to see them (6 hour drive away). We decline for those very reasons- they don't have dogs and it's not fair to ask them to have dogs in their space. We keep them with trusted people at home or we have someone stay at our house while we're out of town. \n\n\nNevermind an agressive dog. I'd not allow an agressive dog in my home with my dogs either! Recipe for disaster for everyone involved!", "I\u2019ve only allowed one dog in my house and that was a small one from one of my neighbors who I know won\u2019t be problem AND it was in one specific room away from the cats. There is no way I am going to upset my cats or allow another dog to claim territory or leave a mess in my house. If it\u2019s people bringing pets in uninvited, that is just rude.", "Depends on the family honestly.\n\nIn my family it's common to bring a dog when visiting as long as it's not aggressive.\n\nMy brother brings his 2 dogs every Christmas. I bring my Alaskan malamute.\n\nBut that's my family. And while it's very common where I live, for you it would not be acceptable.\n\nOP's in law's need to keep their aggressive dog home with a sitter or put him in a dog hotel.", "There are dogs that don\u2019t shed just fyi, but I get what you\u2019re saying. If I\u2019m going to a friends/family house and they have a dog, I\u2019ll ask if I can bring my dog to play with theirs. \n\nMy dog is also super friendly to everything so no one has a problem besides his constant tail wagging, and none stop licking.", "I bring my dog to my parents. But it's with their permission and they've known him for years. I only bring my dog with express permission. Otherwise, he chills at home like the couch potato he is", "As a dog owner of a dog with ptsd that can lead to aggressive scenarios I don't understand this myself. They just purely have to be selfish or self centered. If I'm going to someone's house for any reason and plan on staying there unless its talked about first I'm not going to just bring my dog or assume my dog can come. And if the answer is no the answer is no, I chose a dog because I wanted it, I chose to keep my dog even after his incidents that have him ptsd because I wanted to, they didn't. The only time I even take my dog to other peoples houses is because they ask or were having a playdate. Just expecting people to accommodate to your potentialy aggressive animal is so wild to me.", "Not true. I had a mixed bully who could be super sweet but had a high prey drive and couldn\u2019t be around other dogs.  This isn\u2019t some unusual occurrence.  It will cost more to board the dog since it will have its own room, play and walk times but there are definitely options available. They usually have video cameras set up everywhere so you can check up on your dog. \n\nI would tell OP to have the ILs to do a test run to make sure they are comfortable with the boarding place before doing it over the holidays.", "For a normal visit I might do this. I will not be booted out of my home for Christmas. In-laws can make other arrangements.", "Yep, OP should just go to her mom's for Christmas and either take the cats or board them. Let SO deal with his family and their beastly dog.", "I felt terrible, his name was Shorty, my mom and step-dad had rescued him about a year before my step-dad passed unexpectedly in 2010 and he was a few years old at that point.  My mom and her now husband have a business with high pressure air guns and this was one of the customers who is over frequently and has become good friends over the years but she was super uncomfortable with him bringing his dog since they have several rescue cats and she felt like the dog was going to be a problem.  She had my daughter out doing some school shopping and her husband was in the shop when the dog brought Shorty in like he was some kind of prize after he killed him. They were just sick over it and the guy obviously hasn't brought the dog back since and won't be, but he also felt so bad. All the way around it was pretty heart breaking. Shorty was the last living pet from when my step-dad was alive too so it kind of felt like an extra blow that his chapter ended that way.\nEdit: to clarify this just happened about a month ago.", "How in the world would a dog sitter work if guests can't even come downstairs?", "She and her husband hid upstairs in the  in laws house from the dog and if he doesnt have her back then he isnt much of a man.", "Compromise safety for an aggressive dog? No.\n\nThe deal is this: in-laws are welcome,  the hell hound is not. As caretakers of said hell hound,  it's on the in-laws to compromise.", "You most definitely are not. Your in laws are within their rights to own a dog with behaviour issues that require managing; you are 110% within your rights to not want that animal in your home, terrorizing all the occupants. \n\nI hope you\u2019re able to resolve this situation \u2026 all the best xo", "Did I say otherwise?", "Shepherds can be the best dogs if they're trained and socialized properly.  What a shame.", "No I mean she needs to go to his parents\u2019 house and stay in an Airbnb there or a hotel. If she needs to spend money to make it work that\u2019s what she has to do. He really wants Christmas with his parents this year.", "A dog that has bitten several times should really be put down or placed in a location able to deal with aggressive dogs. Not brought to your house as an unwelcome guest. Your husband is TA here.", "Yea, it's a difficult situation, but I feel like you can make it work together. Sorry for assuming earlier that you have an issue with dogs.\n\nI personally have no clue about cats, but when I was googling for \"What to do when a dog visits me - I own a cat\" one of the things mentioned often was:\n1. If possible keep a room for the cats where no dog smell is allowed to enter so they really feel safe there.\n2. Keep in mind that it might take some time for them to be happy in all rooms again, because they might still be put off by the smell.\n\nAll the best!\n\nBtw.: Of course your husband should've talked with you about \"making it work\" before telling his parents, but well ... next time (that's why I voted N T A and not N A H).", "A crate and muzzle isn\u2019t going to do anything but add stress to the situation. Especially if he\u2019s not being trained with those already. YWBTA if you continue being a pushover about this dog you know is a problem and you\u2019re going to get someone or something seriously hurt. Just put your foot down. Why they even have this dog around still is baffling. What happens when someone in the family has young children? Will it just be a nightmare for them too? This family has to take better accountability for their dog regardless of if he shows improvement, he\u2019s still an aggressive dog.", "Send the cats somewhere. I don't know. \n\nI just know that people come before pets. And in 20-40-50 years when the parents are gone, they will regret it.", "They've never heard of a muzzle? This isn't complex.", "I think you and your husband should figure out how much a hotel room might be where they live. They can't bring the dog to you, and there's every chance they can't leave the dog behind. Maybe see if the in-laws are willing to pay for some of the cost of the hotel? \n\nI will say your Husband is an AH for unilaterally making plans like that.", "LOL yet it's been six years and still no christmas spent together until now. bffr", "They shouldnt have to board the cats to house an aggresive dog. No should mean no. If the il's refuse to board the dog then they shouldnt come", "I don't understand why people get animals they can't control. Know your animal. Know your limitations with it, then work within those. Need a kennel? Get one? Need extra training or socialization? Get it and or do it. Too many people get animals and let them turn into assholes because they can't or won't train them. I eve heard one excuse where the lady wanted to let dogs be dogs. Not realizing that lack of any training means they can't be just dogs. Dogs need manners wherever you go, and not having any limits where you can take your animals.", "Sort your dog out or get rid of it if you cant control it", "In 2022, a dog sitter in Texas was attacked by 2 dogs she was watching. They ripped her face off. The dogs were described as lovely. The sitter had met the dogs. Op is faced with a dog already determined to be aggressive.

You\u2019re seriously asking some minimum wage earning teenager to control a large dog? Most of the staff at kennels don\u2019t get health insurance. You get bit, maybe your employer will pay for the ER visit if you\u2019re lucky, but you\u2019re still going to be out of work.  It\u2019s completely an asshole move.", "Good dog owner.", "This. My family is 3 dog people and 1 outlier with allergies. We bring dogs if my brother, the allergic one, won\u2019t be at a gathering. Leave them home of he will. Never had a discussion about it, just seems to be where we all landed.", "This doesn't read like just having dog aggression, though. I have a dog-aggressive dog and we have similar arrangements as you. Individual room, individual walk and play times, the works. But mine is predictable around people. She's a big ol' mush around people and has never directed her aggression at them.\n\nThis dog, though, sounds like it has unpredictable aggression issues with people and animals alike. If this dog goes ballistic because guests are staying over, that's a pretty big issue.  No kennel is going to want to board a dog that has a high risk of biting one of their workers.", "I board one of my dogs at the vet whenever young children are coming for a visit \u2014 she had what seemed to be aggression many years ago that turned out to be a response to severe joint pain we didn\u2019t know she was having. She\u2019s in excellent health now and hasn\u2019t been \u201caggressive\u201d in years (they usually don\u2019t even muzzle her at the vet despite knowing her full history), and I\u2019m 99% sure she would be fine around kids, but 99% is not 100% and I\u2019m not willing to risk the kids or the dog. \n\nI don\u2019t know how it is at other boarding facilities, but my vet keeps all the dogs separated at all times \u2014 there\u2019s no group play. They do refuse to board dogs who are aggressive toward humans, but you absolutely can board most dog-aggressive dogs. The unfortunate reality is that life with a reactive dog sometimes means you don\u2019t get to travel or have visitors. OP needs to protect herself and her cats here.", "I'm so sorry for your loss.", "In my city you can hire professional  dog sitters who know how to wrangle problematic dogs. It is not cheap, but it is part of the cost of having a problematic dog.\n\nI have a friend who supplements her income by working as a 1099 for a dog sitting company. She is also a professional dog trainer and trains dogs for rescue work -- like for finding people in rubble after ah earthquake and stuff. I believe she charges around $250/day to dog sit for difficult dogs. Like I said, it's not cheap, but it is part of the cost of ownership for people who choose to own dogs like that.", "The dog is currently in training, and I will say that he definitely has improved from how he used to be. Whilst out in public the owners definitely have better control, so at least they're trying to fix the problem. However the dog still is aggressive and territorial, and the training is still in progress. He's definitely still not safe to be around strangers, and definitely not safe to be around cats! In his mother's own words, he still lunges towards men and \"anything smaller than him\".", "I'm gonna disagree, you can't make this work. A big strange dog in a house with indoor cats is already hard, but add aggression and there's a recipe for disaster. I would highly discourage allowing the dog to visit.

It's Joe's entitled family that doesn't seem to realize this by making everyone bend over backwards to accommodate their dog.", "Why don't you volunteer to host a dog that has bitten people? AH!", "Again, there are four adults involved in making those plans, it's not solely down to me.\nMost of the reasons we haven't seen them have been down to my partner's unwillingness to stay in a hotel, or due to my in-laws caring for very sick relatives (that have now passed) so not being available. Plus the expense on both sides - saving for a house then buying a house 2 years ago meant we were short on money for a while, so traveling or hosting was not an option.\nI'm pleased that we have an opportunity this year to host them and that they are available. My only concern is their dog.", "I agree. I don\u2019t know many families that could have adopted our dog. Our sweet girl was abused when she was little, then in and out of rescues before we got her at the age of four. She just clicked with us but has been horribly afraid of anyone but us, our dog trainer, and our amazing housekeeper. So when we travel we often pay as much for her accommodations as we do for ours. Of course it limits our options but our vet and multiple trainers agree this is the absolute best quality of life for her. Some trauma can\u2019t be undone. She can\u2019t be socialized out of this, anxiety meds make it worse. She\u2019s safe and happy and we pay a damn fortune for her care because some horrible people abused an innocent animal. She deserves a happy life.", "I totally agree, but I've noticed on the dog whisperer show where the guy works with badly behaved dogs, it's the dogs' people that he mostly trains. Kind of like a house with badly behaved kids - it's the parents who need instruction.", "I see this at the dog park, people that are obviously afraid of their own dog and afraid to intervene when their dogs get aggressive.  But then people also choose to live with dogs they've not bothered to house train, so go figure.  \n\nNTA OP.  You're right, don't let this dog ruin your Christmas.", "Boom!!!!", "I think part of that answer is when people get dogs, they don't want to spend the money needed to get help with the training.
