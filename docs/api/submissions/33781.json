Maybe I\u2019ve been hanging around in JustNoMIL too much but why would anyone complain about grandparents giving three presents to each kid? How does that make anyone look bad? There is info missing here.", "Bad advice. Don\u2019t punish the kids for the mom\u2019s shit attitude. Don\u2019t get the mom anything.", "Also \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re such a bad mom to your kids that they can\u2019t do basic math yet and understand more people equals more gifts, and also sorry that you apparently cannot buy 3 or more gifts for each of your children\u201d\n\nalso \u201cI\u2019m sorry 3 times 14 is more than 3 times 2\u201d", "Yeah. People are taking this way too much at face value. I really don\u2019t think it has much to do with OP giving people gifts as it does about OP making herself the center of attention on Christmas. \n\n1. This is not her daughter, but daughter-in-law. I\u2019m guessing 1 of 2 things are likely an underlying issue here. They either always go to the husband\u2019s family\u2019s Christmas every year or her own parent\u2019s Christmas is lackluster. Which leads to\u2026\n\n2. The DIL really doesn\u2019t want to be there but is forced to go. And she doesn\u2019t have agency in the situation because her kids (and husband) want to go to this Grandma\u2019s house every Christmas. And with no way to really opt out it leads resentment for\u2026\n\n3. OP\u2019s huge production giving everyone multiple gifts puts them in a tough spot to keep the magic of Christmas going. The young kids are getting more gifts from grandma than Santa, putting financial stress on the DIL and son to come up with more money to provide for Christmas.", "Finally! I had to scroll way too far to see a response like this.\n\nYeah, DiL was completely out of line with her comments, and even more insane to be the one now demanding an apology. But, I agree that OP could have been the bigger person in the moment and not sunk to the same level with the \u201cpoor\u201d crack. She\u2019s insulting her own son at the same time!\n\nAnd the excess? 3 presents for each grandkid, two for each kid and presents for the pets as well? How long does unwrapping take just for the grandkids alone?? Does anyone really need this much stuff? What\u2019s wrong with one present per person?\n\nIt really does feel like there\u2019s some not-so-subtle bragging going on here.\n\nIf I were one of OP\u2019s kids, I\u2019d be telling Mom there could be a better way to go about things and teach the grandkids an important life lesson. Take the extra two presents each grandkid gets and the extra present each kid gets, and donate them to those who truly can\u2019t afford even a fraction of this. Donate to an organization that helps women and kids out of domestic violence situations. Donate to a local toy drive, or a children\u2019s hospital. Donate to a local food bank. So many options that can show the grandkids something about giving to those less fortunate. They\u2019d still get a present from grandma, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re losing out.\n\nI\u2019m with you - ESH for all of the adults in this situation.", "Thank you!  I suspect there\u2019s more to the story and background than OP is telling, and DIL shouldn\u2019t have said what she did. But poor shaming her son and his family in front of the relatives was so uncalled for, and it shows a distinct lack of empathy. Holidays can be so financially stressful when you have young children and want to give them the things they want but can\u2019t always afford to. OP could have handled it much better with a quiet \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you feel that way, as that was not my intention. But I don\u2019t deserve to be spoken to in that manner,\u201d and then pulled her aside later to kindly ask her why she was so upset.", "POO mode is on this, OP won't be able to comment, or comments seen on this thread.", "She gets her kids and grandkids a few gifts.... what are you talking about? Even if she got everyone one gift it'd still LOOK like a lot. The DIL counting boxes is the perpetuator of materialism. \n\nAlso... who said OP's Christian?", "I don't want to be rude, but none of this is OP's problem. She shouldn't have to take anyone aside and talk to them about their financial situation when they do this every year. \n\nNTA", "Why does OP need to show grace when DIL is attacking her in her own home? Maybe if DIL showed some grace and had a private conversation rather than trying to \"show this bitch\", OP would have responded with some grace.", "DIL repeatedly called attention to her poverty.", "You are being far too charitable towards someone who does not deserve it.  Your \"let's sit and see where we went off the rails,\" approach, while noble is borderline laughable.  There's turning the other cheek, and then there's straight up letting an insecure bully run over you out of cowardice.  The \"Y T A\" vote you offered is pretty heinous if we are being honest", "Based on what exactly? The gift giving? The hosting of Christmas? The cooking?", "...Uh huh", "Sound like all the kids got 3 gifts each. And since there were so many people there were a lot of gifts.  The DIL is poor and can't give her kids as nice of a xmas as grandma is providing everyone and is salty about it. What doesn't add up?", "Honestly she came off as smart and practical for spreading the cost out over the year rather than rushing for just the one month.", "She was explaining the circumstances so we would understand the story behind the conflict.", "POO mode is on this, OP won't be able to comment or is OP does comments won't be seen on this thread.\n\nOnly stating it because I am sure a lot of people don't know what it means and OP not responding will make people mad.", "What? Where are you even getting this idea to form a question?", "Her DIL called her a bitch in her own home. She doesn't owe her an apology.  \nNext year she could keep the number of gifts under the tree down by not buying anything for her son, DIL & their kids. Do you think that's the solution the DIL is looking for?", "Lol! Yes!", "The second the B word left DIL\u2019s mouth I would have gathered up their coats and packed up their presents. \n\nA. You are not going to disrespect me in my house.\n\nB. You are not going to tell me how to spend MY money.\n\nC.

The DIL being a jealous cow is not her problem. The son needs to nip this, pronto.", "I mean, an easy solution is to disinvite DIL if seeing her kids have a great Christmas is so troubling to her. Another idea might be to invite DIL to host next year, so the whole family can gather over THERE, and DIL (and her kids) can see that giant mountain of presents that everyone brings for everyone else piled up under HER tree for a change, which might make her feel better. And maybe giving her a taste of all the work and stress involved in hosting might make her more appreciative in the future of someone else doing it for her.\n\nIn any case, definitely NTA.", "Right?! How could no one else have spoken up when the is went down? This absolutely would not fly with my family.", "Right... It would have been throw down time.

I remember one year that we all searched for a present that my oldest niece wanted, but it was sold out.  I found something close, and when my then 8 year old niece opened it she told me that she liked it better than the thing she wanted.  My siblings did a great job raising their kids to understand just how lucky they were to have a big family that cared enough to make the holidays special, and to make sure they got presents.\n\nOP's DIL is missing the point - she should be grateful that her in-laws are making sure her kids are treated fairly, with no distinctions made.  Hopefully, DIL isn't raising her kids to be as ungrateful as she is.", "My dad was VERY competitive with my mom's parents about gift giving.

My dad had a serious complex. He also knew that I loved them more than his mother (for a lot of reasons) and presumed it was due to gifts on holidays. (No, his mother was just awful.)\n\nBut he definitely wanted to be the ONLY person (mom could take partial credit, but he wanted the real glory) who gave me anything I REALLY wanted for Xmas.", "While I don\u2019t agree with DIL, here is another perspective. My MIL buys a ton of presents for my kids. If we don\u2019t tell her to stop, she will send at least 10 presents each, including really big stuff (like 4x6 foot stuff). We had several years in a row where my husband and I would buy something for the holidays, only to find she sent a bigger fancier version. Our oldest was ending up with so many toys, we started to run out of room and my husband and I even stopped buying him Christmas presents because we would say we were getting him something and she would get it too. She\u2019s not a mean or bad person. She just really likes sending stuff. It really started to affect our joy in the season because we couldn\u2019t get our kid much of anything.

Presents are my love language too and i would love to be OP in this spot.  But the whole point is generosity of heart.  Technically sure I can make a case for the gift giver being the aggrieved party. The complaint is about the gift giving being harmful, has legitimacy.  So she became the asshole when that wasn\u2019t as important as the parcels and accolades for getting them.\n\nShe handled it horribly and owes MIL an apology.  I\u2019d rather know her than MIL. I don\u2019t want to know someone so insensitive about financial differences that her response is \u201cit\u2019s not my fault you are poor\u201d.\n\nOne of two things is true.  Either MIL has known for a while that this is an issue and is Determined that her tradition trumps her feelings or this came out of the blue and then sitting down and figuring out where it comes from is appropriate. \n\nMIL can walk away from this snuggly knowing she did nothing wrong and every year cause stress to DIL in dealing with family Christmas or if she was really using gifts to express her family love she can be the bigger person and seek solution.  The ball is now in her court, because it\u2019s her party, her expectation. And she had the last ugly words.", "Yup.

I'd def be embarrassed if I had no or only crap gifts for my kids at Christmas, and had to watch them open really great stuff their grandma got them, but that would be MY problem.

It wasn't I'm sorry your family is having a rough time or my son can't provide, it was that DIL is poor, a very specific jab. \n\n>Enabling bad behaviors is your solution\n\nOops, nope, you're getting you and me confused. Or is calling people poor not bad behavior in your book, cuz you're definitely cosigning that? I'm suggesting you prevent bad behavior by being compassionate. \n\nThe whole scenario just makes it feel like self-serving generosity. If it was actually about the kids having a good Christmas and not about how generous OP is for going so out of her way to get all those presents, then there were other options. OP could've offered to pitch in for a few more presents, or the pets could've gone without or I'm sure the adult children would've been ok with 1 present instead of 2 so that the kids could have a good Christmas. But that's not what happened, cuz it's not about the kids, it's about OP and how everyone telling her how generous she is makes her feel. \n\nEven if she didn't want to do any of that, there are other ways to establish a boundary without insulting the person you're establishing a boundary with. I'm done talking about this, the presents are already there, we can't change anything now, if you're going to continue to rant, I'm going to ask you to leave the table. This is my house, my table, and I won't be disrespected like that, let's behave like adults. \n\nThere was no adult reason to call her poor. It was petty and OP should apologize for that.", "That doesn\u2019t sound like the situation here though.", "We have a very similar situation and have tried over and over to set boundaries without them being respected. We are going to move across the country this year and as a side-perk I\u2019m so excited to be too far away for her to drop a ton of crap off at our house and ruin our Christmas. I just want the chance to gift my kids toys myself and not spend the entire week of Christmas trying to filter through so many toys my kids won\u2019t even play with. For context, we have 2 kids and a large SUV - the toys this year wouldn\u2019t even all fit in our car to drive home.", "Me too. Feeling a certain way about it isn\u2019t the problem.

You\u2019re a good parent.", "That's totally understandable that that was your first impulse. It's OK to feel sad that you can't give your kid as much as you want to give them.

Everybody wins! (Unless Grandma refuses to put \"from Santa\" on the tags and insists upon direct credit for the gifts, which would be a bit of a jerk move.)

I think it just sucks from the kids pov to go from like 5 total presents under a tree to over 100 under a tree, it's gonna make it clear their parents aren't doing well and make them guilty for the stuff they did get.
