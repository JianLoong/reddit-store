They made several replies here, falsely accusing me of making threats, getting physical, etc. None of that happened at all. Calm down and get over yourself you strange person.\n\nEdit: We ran into each other about an hour after posting this, and we apologized to each other and talked it out. He's a fairly good kid, and nobody's upset at one another anymore. I'm going to have to highly disagree with the comments suggesting he purposefully was being inconsiderate or using his autism as a get out of jail free card for everything in life. I've met my share of people like that, but that isn't what happened here. Also, to the one person who sent me a private chat saying I'm a narcissist, my wife laughed at you and wants everybody to know she thinks you're a dingus.\n\n------------------\n\nA few days ago, some kid moved in to the vacant apartment on my floor. Right off the bat, our introduction wasn't on a great note. He somehow couldn't figure out how to get inside the building (you just use a key...) and I had to come out at 1 AM in the snow to help him. I let it slide since he looked about 18 and maybe hadn't lived in an apartment ever.\n\nFast forward to tonight, when he for some reason decided to do his laundry and drying at... 1 AM. For the record, my apartment is right above the washer and dryer in the basement. All 10 families in the complex get enough time to do the laundry, with leases saying you can only do it between 8 AM and 9 PM.\n\nAs you can expect, my apartment was shaking to the point it woke me up. I went down to the basement and saw him with a deer in the headlights look. I asked him why he was doing his laundry this late at night, well into quiet hours, and he didn't have anything to say. I told him he isn't any exception to the quiet hours rule, and he started firing one excuse after another, saying this was his first apartment, claiming he'd never felt the washing machine in his adjacent apartment, etc. I told him to stop with the excuses and take this as a lesson learned to not do laundry outside the hours outlined in the lease. He gave yet another excuse, saying that he's autistic and sometimes doesn't think things through the way a normal person would. He started stuttering out apologies and hoping I don't hate him (???). I just went upstairs and told him that if he ever needs to do laundry at night again, to take an Uber to a 24/7 laundromat.\n\nI went to the gas station to get soda, and when I got back in bed, my wife let me know she went down there and talked to him. Apparently he's afraid of men in general and was worried I'd call management and he'd end up homeless, and my wife had to reassure him nothing like that would happen.

You let him know what the expectation was within the building and even gave him an option should the 1 AM laundry need strike again.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t go down there and scream at him. You probably could have been more gentle, but there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with being direct. Sounds like he has a bit of trauma that made the encounter more difficult for him, but luckily your wife is an absolute treasure and was able to reassure him. Now that you\u2019re aware of his situation though a gentle, \u201chey buddy, remember what we discussed re laundry during quiet time?\u201d Would be better suited, but you hardly knew that in advance.", "Nah. I can see how he figured if the laundry was open, it was okay to use it any time he wanted. Sounds like it's been resolved.", "NTA. If he does unsociable things he's going to be confronted angrily, especially if interrupting someone's sleep. You're not going out of your way to be a dick. It's up to him to know what the rules are and how they apply to him, not up to everyone else to accommodate him, particularly at 1am", "NTA at all, and I\u2019m not understanding any of these Y T A comments. It\u2019s absolute fucking common sense to not start a cycle of laundry in the middle of the night when you live in an apartment building. You got woken up by it and it\u2019s completely reasonable you\u2019d be angry. As someone with a serious mental illness, it\u2019s unreasonable and unrealistic to use that as a crutch to avoid responsibility.", "I might be going against the grain here but NTA.  Anyone with a bit of common sense realizes you don\u2019t make noise in the middle of the night.  Imagine if you weren\u2019t confrontational, his behavior would have continued.  You may have been harsh, but I get it.", "Soft AH, but you wife is an absolute angel", "Soft YTA here - I understand your frustration at being woken up at that hour, but it sounds like you came in guns-a-blazin\u2019 on the poor kid. It\u2019s his first apartment, he\u2019s autistic, and it sounds like he has some phobia and perhaps trauma surrounding men; he\u2019s not going to be perfect at all of this stuff off the bat. And of course you couldn\u2019t have known these personal things about him\u2026except for when he tried to explain it to you. You seem to dismiss all of his explanations as excuses, when really he was just trying to explain *why* and give context. You did ask first why he was doing the laundry, it just took him awhile to respond.\n\nI think if you\u2019d calmed down and listened to him first, you could\u2019ve avoided coming across quite as harsh as you did. Again I understand your frustrations here and it\u2019s not like you\u2019re a bad person or anything. It\u2019s just a bit more kindness and patience is what a situation like this needs, which your wife seems to be aware of. It might be helpful to apologize to him and give him a few tips related to the rules and operating hours of other things in the building. That shows him you\u2019re a good neighbor while also hopefully minimizing any future events like this.", "NTA!!! You didn\u2019t intimidate him? You didn\u2019t scream at him?? I don\u2019t know where the ef people got that from. \n\nThe child made a mistake. You didn\u2019t take it personal. \n\nI have extreme anxiety that even standing next to an unknown man causes me to palpitate, but reading what you said sounded reasonable, unless you have a deep voice then I understand feeling like you\u2019re getting yelled at. \n\nBut those downplaying the literal movement of your apartment, or telling you to expect noise? What?\n\nWhen moving into anywhere w a lease/contract, it is important to always read it thoroughly. \n\nAs you should be when you\u2019re signing it. \n\nI understand the kid didn\u2019t know any better. \n\nBut OP just made it clear to be mindful next time. He didn\u2019t cuss him out. \n\nJust confronted the one making noise at 1am. As anyone would do. \n\nAnd I hope the boy has some form of therapy to help w his fear of men, because unfortunately living in an apartment alone won\u2019t help it. \n\nBut could be why he does laundry late at night, so when you apologize I\u2019d ask OP. \n\nAnd even suggest to go during hours people are mainly at work as they\u2019re usually empty I\u2019d believe as they are in the places I\u2019ve lived.", "Nta", "Not for telling him but you seem a bit of one how you handled it. I mean you must have recognised that he was actually afraid when he gave all these excuses, didn't you? See, I would be annoyed as well but if I see the other one actually is afraid and if the excuses would annoy me any further I would just say: \"No big deal, just don't do it again.\" And I am actually a very strict person that can come off as harsh but I wouldn't want to let someone be an over the top uncomfortablenesses in context to the actual situation. For that it wouldn't need the information of him being autistic, it would just clear my surprise that someone would be scared from that. But well, I am a woman and that we're on average a little better in such things is no secret, lol (you're on average better in other things, just saying, before someone feels pissed when coming along someone who doesn't ignore differences in sex).

Including those who claim to be autistic.\n\nNTA.", "YTA, kind of. The guy should be respectful of the lease and quiet hours but it sounds like he didn't know or realize. You could have just told him the quiet hours/laundry times and directed him to the lease and asked him to please do laundry inside those hours because of the noise and such. Maybe don't go at him so hard.", "Soft YTA for how you went about it. I understand being woken up at 1am, but it's not something he's constantly done that you've spoken to him about. You said yourself that he looked young & I'm sure you scared him which is why he was saying so many things. Your wife is really sweet & I'm sure she handled it better than you did. Perhaps you could speak with him along with your wife so he's comfortable & you can discuss things in a helpful way that might ease things for everyone.", "YTA. The fact that you said he looked like a deer in the headlights says to me that you intimidated him. You should have read the situation better, he\u2019s 18 and told you he\u2019s autistic.  But given his initial response, you should have changed tactic.", "YTA you intimidated him. Guy didn't read the rules and needed to be told, yes, but ya could have been a little nicer about it.", "You politely accepted your feedback and agreed to restart neighborly relations with a gift basket. Yes, soft YTA, but definitely fixable and good on you for not being defensive!", "YTA\n\nIt's okay to be flustered about the noise, I hate it when things keep me up so I totally get it. But it sounds like you were unnecessarily confrontational about it. This could have been handled better if you had kindly explained that it keeps you up, the kid probably would have just apologized and never done it again, and everything would have been fine. Jumping down his throat over a mistake was not necessary.", "NTA.\n\nTake this from someone with special needs of.... varying severity, if he\u2019s using it as a get out of jail free card and he does it too often then yes, I\u2019d agree on them trying to stop you from blaming them, it\u2019s not acceptable even if it is something that does need to be taken into account. You did the right thing in asking him not to and your wife is an amazing person, I\u2019d suggest asking her to help you communicate with him.", "Sorry YTA - there's approaching with a level head and being a nice neighbour and there's going in all guns blazing. \n\nYou autistic neighbour sounds sweet", "Soft YTA you overreacted, but you did not know what was happening and you did not know about the kids mental issues. You were woken up in the middle of the night so being mad is understandable. As long as you apologize for your screaming and he does not do laundry in the middle of the night again, I think you are fine.", "[deleted]", "YTA. It sounds like the kid was apologizing profusely and instead of just saying \"now you know, everybody has to learn somehow\" you just kept complaining and berating him. It wasn't necessary at all. You called his apology \"excuses\" and then when he tried to explain as part of the apology that being autistic makes it tough for him to guess reactions, you continued to be harsh. He wasn't making excuses, he was trying to apologize and explain. You had every right to tell him about the quiet time hours but that could have been a simple statement, not a tirade.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
