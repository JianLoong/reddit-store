That's her choice and should be respected. Also, Robyn wants it for the wrong reasons. It's sentimentally valuable and sounds like an increasingly rare and valuable, intact set. It shouldn't be broken up and sold, but kept together as a family heirloom. \n\nINFO by the way: did you grandmother leave Robyn something else? If she left everyone something specific and Robyn has already got hers, this would be double dipping.", "Nta. It's yours. And you want it because it was your grandmother's.

I highly doubt Grandma wanted it sold off.", "NTA \n\nGrandmother's china is where grandmother wanted it to be.  Enjoy it!", "NTA... She can sell her own stuff if she wants the surgery.  Your stuff is your stuff.  As long as its legal, it doesn't matter how/why you got it.  Period.  Do with it, what will.", "NTA. Your grandmother gave you the china. It belongs to you. Your cousin isn\u2019t suddenly entitled to it just because she decided she is.", "NTA, it's not her property to decide what to do with. Hide it if you have to.", "NTA! The whole point of a will is for the deceased to pass along their possessions in the manner of their choosing. Grandma chose you, and that is all that matters.", "NTA\n\nThe china set was willed to you specifically. This isn't each grandkid got to pick one thing or set after Grama died, this is Grama actually went through and bequeathed those in writing in a legal document while she was still healthy to do so.", "NTA- Absolutely not. Your grandma wanted you to have the china- she **literally** put it in her will. Even if you wanted to sell the china or go out and smash it on the pavement, that would be your right because it is *your* china now, this literally has nothing at all to do with Robyn nor will it ever.", "NTA. That's your china. Even if it's sold for good reason, it's still better to keep it and use it.", "NTA. I don't think, as yoy said, that Robyn being identified as a woman would change anything about your grandma giving you her china. \n\nRobyn can fin other way to finance her surgery other than wanting to sell a thing it's not even hers.", "NTA. \n\nWho is Robyn to second guess your grandmother\u2019s intentions and will?  She is the AH here. Not you.", "NTA and the value is significantly diminished if parts of the set are missing. It makes way more sense to keep the set together.", "NTA your grandmother wrote her will when she was of sound mind and body. \nYour cousin isn't owned anything. You don't own your cousin a dime. She wants to gave surgery then she needs to be a grown up and fiqure it for herself.", "NTA\n\nChina is not a gendered item, so it isn't automatically owed to all granddaughters. \n\nYour cousin isn't owed a portion of your inheritance - especially since she wants it to sell instead of wanting it for sentimental reasons", ">My grandmother recently passed away.

These things are usually inherited as a whole set and not separated between a couple different people.", "Definitely NTA", "Nope. NTA.", "NTA especially because you're keeping it and are going to use it. Robyn is being greedy and opportunistic.", "NTA. Robyn would like something a granddaughter might receive. Selling the china is an excuse; even rare china patterns won't earn but a fraction of what surgery costs.\n\nAre there any of Grandma's heirlooms - a piece of jewelry, a beloved book - that Robyn could have for remembrance? It would be kind to offer if you can.", "NTA\n\nYour grandmother willed it to you, and \"half\" a China set would be useless.\n\nGet it appraised and offer her a token cash settlement for her half.

Robyn wasn't willed it. She has no claim to it whatsoever and is an AH for even asserting as such. Moreover, her claim isn't even about being a granddaughter to your grandmother, it's a cynical, vulgar, transparent cash grab. I can't imagine your grandmother left it to you with the hope that you would sell it. Keep it and tell her to drop it. It's not up to discussion, not now, not ever. Don't entertain it further.  \n\nI would also recommend making sure you store it safely as I've seen too many spiteful AHs destroy treasured things because they didn't get their way.", "NTA, tell Robyn to get bent. The China was left to you and you alone.", "I really hope you are right. I loved my grandmother--and a love of cooking and entertaining is something we shared. It was a special thing between us.

She had her own inheritance but is bummed she can\u2019t sell it. That ain\u2019t it fam.", "Why? Robyn was willed something of her own.

You\u2019re totally NTA & I hope she can accept that, and find another way to fund her future.", "I have no doubt that even if you were a guy, your grandma would've still left you the china.

Being trans is irrelevant. Only thing that matters is that the china was willed to you and you are the only one who has a say in how it is used.", "Robin is TA. Selfish and entitled", "NTA. It\u2019s YOUR China SET. Full stop. There is no sharing a full set of china.", "NTA, she wants to break up YOUR set of beautiful china and SELL it?!!I love China and wouldn't dream of doing this. It's your property, don't let her sell some", "NTA\n But don't me tonight that you might give it up if she intended to use it.\n\nYou may find she has a sudden \"change of heart\" after that.", "I wasn\u2019t the only granddaughter but I was the oldest granddaughter and close to my grandma and she left me her china.\nIt\u2019s a discontinued pattern but I don\u2019t think think it would sell for much not that I would want to.\nI doubt Robyn would get much for an incomplete set but you don\u2019t owe it to her.\nIf grandma wanted it to go to her granddaughter she wanted it to be used, not sold.

Absolutely fine, according to your grandmother\u2019s will she already has \u2018her share\u2019 - she was willed none and gets none.

Keep the China set and make a donation towards her surgery.", "Robyn is definitely not entitled to the china given to OP. But also, let's not pretend that it is easy for Transwomen to find work, so it's not necessarily as simple as \"go work for your surgery.\" But OP is nta for wanting to keep it all intact.", "NTA", "Nta\u2026..\n1. The China was a willed to you \n2. Who in their right mind splits up a China set to me an english woman you never split up a China that is just despicable", "NTA. It\u2019s yours. Especially NTA as you plan to keep and use it where as they just want to sell it.", "Robyn doesnt want her 'share of the china' she wants money to afford transition.\n\nTo do that with something not even hers is gross. As another has sugessted, make sure the set is locked away before she gets sticky fingers. I wouldn't be surprised if some pieces get taken and sold slowly"]}
