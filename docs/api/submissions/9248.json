Your cousin, however, is. Your grandmother left the set of china to you. No one is expected to split up a set of china, any more than one would expect to split up an elaborately coordinated outfit. All of the pieces are made to be presented together.

Her wishes should be honored and her legacy respected. Just because \"robyn\" decided to become a granddaughter doesn't mean she's entitled to your inheritance.", "OP I wouldn't give it away or share it if i were you. 1. It is yours, willed of to you by your grandma, 2. She knew that you would appreciate its worth, sentimental and not just financial and 3. You never split a set, especially one so rare, and must be beautiful.", "It doesn't matter what Robyn wants the money for. It's your inheitence, per your Grandma's wishes.", "NTA.   \nMake sure she isn\u2019t left alone while visiting.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nLook, this is a difficult situation. The assumption you\u2019re making is that you were gifted the china as you were the only girl, and that as you no longer are, it\u2019s fair to share it. I\u2019d like to challenge that. I think your grandmother gave you the china because she knew you\u2019d love, cherish and use it. She probably knew that you loved how she entertained people with it, and that you\u2019d continue the tradition. \n\nOut of curiosity; did Robyn get anything from the will? Because if she did, then she absolutely got her fair share, gender and monetary value regardless. Inheritance isn\u2019t entirely about money - it\u2019s about sentimental value too. Your grandmothers death isn\u2019t something to cash in on.\n\nAt the end of the day, the china was left to you. You love it, you\u2019re going to use it, and you want to honour your grandmother by keeping it as a complete set. That is perfectly fair. I understand that Robyn desperately (and fairly) wants her surgery, but guilting you is not the way to go about it. \n\nWhile I\u2019m here; lock the china up. If you live with your parents/family, find somewhere else to keep it, and tell no one (or keep it in your room and get a lock).  If you\u2019re on your own/with roommates, don\u2019t let anyone related to Robyn (aka her mother) into your place alone, and tell your roommates the same. If Robyn does come over, don\u2019t use that china set. By the sound of it, she might just break something on purpose, out of pure spite, and that would be devastating. \n\nI am truly sorry for your loss, and that you are having to deal with this drama while you are grieving. I hope that you get to use the set as much as you had planned, and that it brings you as much joy as it did when your grandmother used it.", "NTA, it\u2019s your\u2019s and the cousin just wants to sell it to fund something? Nah, tell the cousin to get bent.", "NTA, the china was YOUR gift from your grandmother.  It was legally left you you in her will.  The intent was to keep it together, not split it up.  You are the custodian for this heirloom.  Robyn needs to stop being entitled and figure out another way to fund her surgery.", "When my father died, my grandfather and aunt looted all of his belongings and funds.  Last time I saw him at my father\u2019s funeral, he was wearing Dad\u2019s Rolex watch.  I was just 20 and didn\u2019t know about the theft for a couple of years.  NTA.  Throw a lovely dinner and toast your grandmother.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nDidn\u2019t Robyn get gifted something ? Is she offering to share ?", "Nta. It was meant for you. You will use it. Not sell it.", "NTA grandma willed it to You. You are the one she wanted to have it. Everything else and everybody else do Not matter and have Zero say.", "This. There is no \"Robyn's share\", plain and simple. The china was left to YOU, not \"any granddaughter\".\n\nBesides, breaking up a set seriously diminishes its resale value.", "Do not ever let your cousin come over lol. Heirlooms are priceless, you don't want her doing something out of spite. I feel for her, but this is your memento of your grandmother. Protect it please. People that want irreplaceable stuff for selfish reasons stress me out, lol. I", "Even if there were 50 granddaughters, she left it to you. Definitely NTA. Please for the love of god and baby Jesus on a blue banana do not give her half.", "Thing is, china doesn't have that much resell value nowadays. It's difficult to handle, super delicate and takes up a lot of space. The market for people wanting to clutter their homes with dishes that don't go into the dishwasher is very, very small. And if you split a complete set, like your cousin wants you to, its monetary worth will be even less.\n\nI'd suggest honour it, and use tf out of it. So what if it gets chipped, at least every meal makes you think of grandma.", "Wow. Your cousin sounds spiteful and vain. Cut the cousin off. It won\u2019t be any loss.", "Also, much fun selling an incomplete set of china. There's almost no market for it these days."]}
