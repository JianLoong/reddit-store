What a clown world we live in\nOP I hope you pay your parents back what they gave you.", "NTA. This is not your problem. If they do not even have 500 to spare for school fees, they will also not have 500 to spare to pay you", "Have her write you a check for 500 dollars and then tell her you will wait until Friday to cash it. Then you could give her the money and ensure you will be paid back.", "It shouldn\u2019t matter if or when she pays you back. You said no. Anything after is attempted coercion", "\"If you have the money to pay for classes, you have $150 to lend me for Pampers.\"\n\nAn actual quote from my cousin, back when I was putting myself through Uni by working a full time job. \n\n \"It's because I pay for my own classes that I have no money.\"  Yeah, I won't even go into why she really needed $150 (around $350 in today's dollars) for \"Pampers\"... \n\nNTA\n\nNever let family use emotional blackmail and resentment to rob you of the future you're working so hard for.", "Lol, they're his parents. They definitely have all his info.", "Retail cashier here! I also do cash office in the mornings. One of my tasks every day is to verify all the checks we got the previous day were signed (we've gotten at least one check every day I've worked there, so at least 200 days of evidence) and then process them in the computer/get them set up to be mailed to the bank. The courier for cash comes a couple times a week. So writing a check and not having it deposited the same day IS still a possibility in 2023 America (not sure of OP's nationality).\n\nOTOH, a check made out to a school is... iffy. They may have electronic check reading/depositing set up, they may not, but they may also have someone who's happy to go deposit the check/visit the bank for change for the bake sale fundraiser/etc. because they can grab a nice iced coffee on the clock.", "I believe europe and australia don't do checks anymore. There were other threads where people were like \"just write a check\" and the non-americans were all like \"lol, backwards americans!\""]}
