I am talking about ending my own lease early, moving into incredibly dodgy and dangerous housing, selling my own stuff kind of rock bottom. It's financial abuse and if you do it once it won't stop until you get to that point and you have no more to give. I would put myself in financial dire straits because of her manipulation and guilt trips and so on. Stop thinking about lying about you have no money.

For one your mom was out of line with the name calling.\n\nNow I am prepared for downvotes. I don\u2019t know what your relationship is with your sister, but I (also majored in computer science) helped put my brother through some schooling because I could afford to, we are close, and he\u2019d do the same if roles were reversed. We do have a large age gap so I was post college and maybe our finances are completely different. One Christmas my parents didn\u2019t really have any money, but he was still a kid, and my then bf now husband and I made sure he had as many gifts under the tree we could afford as poor college students. It\u2019s not your job, but if you can help and have a good relationship with your sister- I\u2019d do it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
