Now I\u2019m ashamed of being a picky eater as it just looks like I\u2019m searching for attention when in reality I try my best not to come across that way. She made a chicken soup meaning she cooked chicken then she shredded it and put a tomato soup-like thing over it. My whole life I\u2019ve actively hated chicken I\u2019ve tried it so many times and I just hate it same with tomatoes so I asked my sister if I could maybe just have a salad however she refused and told me I was an attention seeker and I was a bad person for not wanting to try it. I didn\u2019t want to cause more drama in front of my family so I sucked it up and tried to eat it, I immediately hated the taste and the texture and I felt like I wanted to throw up I know it seems dramatic but I have a huge problem with texture and every time I\u2019ve had chicken I\u2019ve threw up. Everyone pressured me into having a second bite and I hated it but I pushed through then everyone started pressuring me even more to have another big bite and I gagged I tried not to but it just happened I ran upstairs and threw up i started crying as I felt bad for causing a scene. My mom berated me in front of everyone and my sister didn\u2019t speak to me the rest of the time. \n\nI really can\u2019t tell if I was wrong or not.

You did nothing wrong here (It would be good for you if you managed to stick up to them, but that doesn't make this your fault).\n\nIt might be a good idea to talk to a doctor about this, and maybe look up ARFID (Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder).", "NTA but you should read up on autism and other disorders that can cause extreme sensory issues and food aversions.

Next time, stick to what you feel is right.   You're eighteen now and that means that you're an adult (in most countries anyway).   You are going to have to stand up for what you feel is right for you, even when it isn't popular.

I personally deal with texture issues, due to my own sensory issues. I've theorised personally that it might be because I'm neurodivergent but even if not, I simply cannot eat foods with textures that my body doesn't agree with.\n\nA picky eater could be struggling with the sensory issues that comes from neurodivergency, an eating disorder, etc. Most picky eaters know how to deal with it though, but the weird new stigma around it isn't exactly welcoming for picky eaters to simply make their own food like some comments say.", "NTA.

OP also stated that they have tried chicken multiple times throughout their life but still hate it due to texture issues.

You have a flavour palette and you are old enough to decide what you want to eat and not. Your mother should freaking know after 18 years that she shouldnt push you into eating what you dont like. \nShe knows you tried. \nSo tbh she should tell your sister off. \n\nMaybe you could take a look at ARFID.

I am also a picky eater, and have profound issues with some foods. Fish is probabily the worst of them all, and it has been like this since i was an infant. I hate everything from the taste, the smell, the texture. And i've tried countless fishes made in any way possible.\n\nI hate salmon expecially. I still try to eat some fish when my parents cook it, so i don't cause so much trouble, but i absolutely hate salmon, but they made it anyway. And the last time i had it i threw up so much that i can't even begin to think about eating it again. \n\nThis happened more then a year ago, maybe two, but my mom still brings it up and thinks i've made myself sick on purpose just to not eat it anymore.

I just happens.", "NTA As a person who hates soup, just the description of the food has me pulling my face and don't let anyone force you to eat food you don't like.

Do these people also force people into sex so as not to feel bad about their sex? In the South, so many fully grown adults were snotty to me in the 80s about turning my nose up about foods- like they\u2019ll just melt if anyone thinks their taste in food is imperfect. Adults just ragging on a three year old because they\u2019re that afraid that their food is embarrassing in some way. It\u2019s like they think that saying, \u201cI don\u2019t eat onions, I don\u2019t eat meat,\u201d is the same as calling them gross, dirty hill people who eat poor person food (if you\u2019re not from the south, you may not get this- but the chip on the shoulder everyone down here if you don\u2019t fully agree with all of their choices is humongous. Not agreeing is too much for many to survive. Everyone is so afraid of how they\u2019ll feel if someone \u201cturns their nose up\u201d to some food that they\u2019ll have 5 kids on one toddler, just hazing them into eating foods in a worse manner than fraternities hazed at my university- and people died from that shit. Still, southern adults are worse if they happen to see a child who doesn\u2019t want to sloppily pig out on exactly the same food choices they make. It\u2019s really weird, and I think it\u2019s just so brainless and classless and tactless and trashy).", "NTA. I don't have it as extreme as you, but I have an aversion to pork and beef (beef I can eat only if breaded and cooked all the way). I will end up throwing up if I eat those two. My family, thankfully, doesn't eat red meat. But I can't eat onions. Never liked them. I feel that when I eat them, it burns my tongue, and idk why. It just hurts to eat them. My family for years tried to force it on me. And shame me. They stopped after I was around 8-9 years old. Cause they realized it was just onions.

Tastes just differ. 0/10 tastebuds in common. Ok, chocolate with one grandma.  \nAhem...

She seems to be trying to do a graduate course in Asshole.", "I'm so sorry. Unfortunately, if people can't physically see a problem that someone has, then they choose not to understand and consider it attention seeking. \n\nI have one granddaughter who eats almost everything whilst her sister is very specific about her food. That's the way she is, so we accommodate.", "NTA! NTA! NTA! \n\nThey actively saw you try it, hate it, and then said to keep eating?? That's awful! I for one share your odd relationship with food. I am not as picky about flavors, but I can not stand certain textures. As well as I can't handle it when my food is touching. Despite the fact I am a full fledged adult I still use children's plates with the seperaters in them.\n\nI've been made fun of for it a ton. Like, to the point I have developed a slight phobia of eating in front of others, to the point I would rather not eat then let someone I don't trust deeply see me eat. I've only had a few people in my life ever get genuinely angry with me about it, and they usually stopped upon seeing how much it genuinely effects me.\n\nThe best course of action I can suggest going forward is talking to your doctor, more specifically a therapist or psychologist. You don't mention anything besides being a picky eater, but your strong reactions (to me anyway) indicate something deeper in your brain. For me there unfortunately hasnt been much they can do for it, despite figuring out what has been causing it. It may help though to have a readily available reason for it, as some people won't listen or respect you until you say \"I can't do this because of this.\" As well as they may even be able to help you expand your pallette a bit with the help of therapy.\n\nI also just want to add, it does not make you lesser for having issues with eating.

We just need to respect it.\" I wish you the best of luck with whatever you choose to do!", "It's abusive behaviour to force someone to eat food which they don't want.\n\nYour mother and sister should be ashamed of themselves.

You have my sincere sympathies as I went through times being forced to eat food that made me sick (fish and seafood). It ended when instead of me rushing to the toilet, bucket or bowl I began aiming at the responsible person (at their lap or torso). When told that was not acceptable I responded 'it's not rocket science, stop feeding me the foods that make me sick and I will not be able to be sick over you'. I took no prisoners. I also began adding vinegar to drinks and once mustard powder to custard in retaliation to fish and seafood being added to my plate (my siblings stopped finding their little jokes funny when they quite literally got a taste of it). Without knowing how they will react I cannot recommend that you go down the additions route.

So finding \u201csurprises\u201d in my food can lead to projectile vomiting. It will happen, and I can\u2019t do anything to prevent it. All I can do is try to get to a bathroom before I end up vomiting near or on people. \n\nYou didn\u2019t cause a scene at dinner, your family forced one on you. \n\nPlease talk to a doctor.

My partner ate only one vegetable when we met. Now he eats many, but it took him a long while to grow in confidence to try new things in a relaxed environment (as in, an environment without judgment or pressure \u2013 the way his parents reacted to his aversions really affected his relationship with food).

She made a chicken soup meaning she cooked chicken then she shredded it and put a tomato soup-like thing over it. My whole life I\u2019ve actively hated chicken I\u2019ve tried it so many times and I just hate it same with tomatoes so I asked my sister if I could maybe just have a salad however she refused and told me I was an attention seeker and I was a bad person for not wanting to try it. I didn\u2019t want to cause more drama in front of my family so I sucked it up and tried to eat it, I immediately hated the taste and the texture and I felt like I wanted to throw up I know it seems dramatic but I have a huge problem with texture and every time I\u2019ve had chicken I\u2019ve threw up. Everyone pressured me into having a second bite and I hated it but I pushed through then everyone started pressuring me even more to have another big bite and I gagged I tried not to but it just happened I ran upstairs and threw up i started crying as I felt bad for causing a scene. My mom berated me in front of everyone and my sister didn\u2019t speak to me the rest of the time. \n\nI really can\u2019t tell if I was wrong or not.

I was horrified by your story OP. So many cultures sadly have a thing about making kids eat foods they hate.  Even the whole \u201cyou are required to try one bite\u201d is not a good thing. \n\nMy friend who is a pediatrician recommends something called \u201cdivision of responsibility\u201d for feeding children. Caretakers present a variety of healthy food and kids decide if and how much of the food to eat. No one comments on what anyone else eats. Kids are taught to say 2 things when food is offered \u201cno thank you\u201d or \u201cyes please\u201d.   Apparently kids are happier and have healthier eating habits when families implement this. (There are special instructions for disorders like AFRID). But making kids eat, even making them try foods is not encouraged because kids generally do better when they decide when to try a new food.  I grew up with a lot of stressful dinners being called \u201cpicky\u201d and hated it. I didn\u2019t enjoy food till I was an adult. I find this a breath of fresh air.", "NTA and shame on your mom and sister for their behavior. They and the others egging you on pretty much scripted the whole scene.", " NTA - you have arfid I have to. I struggle with texture and taste as well. My family never pressured me and always helps with compromises you aren\u2019t attention seeking at all.

I was forced to eat foods that repulsed me as a kid, with my stepmother watching me choke back tears and oatmeal at the same time and dismissively saying \"it's not like we're making you eat broken glass.\" This happened repeatedly and literally traumatized me. If it wasn't your sister's brand new house I would have suggested you throw up at the table to show that you're not being overdramatic about it. Plus, you did try the soup!

Your sister and mother definitely are though.\n\nARFID (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) is a very real thing that can come in many forms and be associated with taste, texture, smell, sound when eating, etc.\n\nIt has become more understood by normal people who are not involved in healthcare in the last and accepted as a disorder rather than someone \u2018just being a picky eater\u2019. However, there are still many people who don\u2019t take time to do some basic research and educate themselves who will continue to live in wilful ignorance so that they can use this to attack and belittle people who have a real condition, which is what your sister and mother have done to you.\n\nIt seems that both your sister and mother were very well aware that you had intolerances to both chicken and tomatoes, and lo and behold, your sister made a dish starring both of these items. It was a petty and childish targeted attack on you with the hope that you\u2019d be publicly embarrassed and shamed when you could not eat the dish.\n\nYou\u2019re also 18 - still young and developing - and it is in childhood and adolescence that ARFID really hits hard, so don\u2019t feel bad about only being able to eat certain things.\n\nIf the types of food you can eat are extremely limited and doesn\u2019t equate to a healthy diet, I would seek help from dieticians and specialist to try and lower your sensitivity and tolerance to include more variety into your diet. You\u2019re still very young so you can make some positive changes if you need them.\n\nMy advice: if you can see a specialist and get an offical diagnosis it may help to convince your family that you have a real condition and are not doing this \u2018for attention\u2019 - this depends on their views on eating disorder and mental health related conditions. If they continue to harass you I would say when you can move away go LC and just leave if they disrespect you.\n\nTLDR: you likely have ARFID and have made your food intolerances well known and your sister made a dish of items you can\u2019t eat to humiliate you.

People who aren't picky eaters don't understand this: people who are picky eaters don't want to be picky eaters. \n\nI'd love to be able to have a salad, but it feels like I'm eating paper. I'd love to have a Big Mac, but the combination of different textures grosses me out more than you could imagine. I'd love to be able to order a random thing off the menu and not worry about the taste, texture, what it'll do to my body, etc. I would love to not be a picky eater, but it's harder than not to find safe foods. I'd love to not stare at my plate and pick apart everything so it's not a texture nightmare.\n\nMy sister can't eat chocolate cake because she threw it up once when she was a kid. Every time she tries to eat it, it tastes like puke to her. We just never made her a chocolate cake. If she wants to try it, it's up to her. We didn't try to throw her a chocolate cake intervention. Because her being unable to eat a specific food is not an issue - there's more to life than forcing someone to eat a food you like. \n\nPressuring someone to eat a certain food will do nothing but isolate a person further from that food. I hate Mac n' cheese. But it's a staple child's food. Every time I was forced to eat it as a kid, the more I never wanted to engage with it. I still feel that way. I've never had it since I was forced to eat it. \n\nIs it good to try to expand your safe foods? Yes. I try to, even if it ends up that that food is on my no-go list. I'll try it. But it's important to be on YOUR OWN TERMS. \n\nThe problem is - it isn't someone else's job to force you, an adult, to eat a specific food. You're an adult.

It's hard to explain to people that it can cause a literal physical response - in the worst case if can be gagging, panic, sometimes when I tried to force myself to eat a horrible food I'd literally cry out of distress.)\n\nI've tried, so hard. \n\nBut wow, I've felt a lot happier since I found out what ARFID is, since I've learned why I react like this, and since I've accepted it!  It's made me able to eat *better*. Not just because I no longer force myself to eat food that makes me extremely distressed, but because I can kind of figure out what the factors are that really bother me. And then I can try to change those factors!  \n\nLike I hated spaghetti forever. Then I figured out that what bothered me most was the texture of gross tomato chunks in the spaghetti sauce.  I tried a spaghetti sauce that had no chunks...and holy crap now I actually like spaghetti???\n\nBut there's some food I'll never like, and that's okay.  I'm never going to eat chilli.  So (once my parent *finally* understood that I wasn't *being stubborn*, I was *suffering*), when they'd make chilli, I'd make myself something else. It wasn't me being ungrateful, it was me wanting them to be able to enjoy a food they like, without worrying about me getting sick or being miserable.\n\nMy family used to treat me similarly to yours.  They finally started to understand, after years. They used to literally force-feed me, plugging my nose and shoving food in my mouth when I had to open my mouth to breathe. While I cried and begged. No one would go through that - or what you go through, throwing up, etc - out of stubbornness or pickiness. It's insane for people to think that. And no family should treat you like yours is. They have no right. They're making fun of you, treating you SO cruelly, for something you can't help. They need to smarten the fuck up, they're behaving disgustingly. Frankly, they're behaving abusively. They're forcing you to do something that hurts you.  \n\nThat's not right.\n\nMy life has gotten so much better since I figured out what is going on. \n\nI have a limited type of food I can eat, but now that I know why, I'm not just... berating myself for it. I know that it's legitimate, it's a genuine, diagnosable eating disorder (often associated with being autistic, or having ADHD - think sensory issues and extreme sensitivity). And I now that I'm aware of it, I know the types of food I can eat are fairly limited, so I also am more aware of trying to make sure I get vitamins, etc.  I'm aware of it, and I can accept it, and try to work with it and around it to keep myself healthy, instead of beating myself up over it!

But at the same time, they do know themselves best, and unfortunately professionals can misdiagnose or miss things too. The misdiagnosis of autistic women (as not autistic, or as something else) is unfortunately hugely common. Self diagnosis CAN turn out to be correct and helpful to the person, especially if they do not have financial or other access to professional diagnosis.", "no", "... Mate, if you think doctors are very ignorant, what chance do you have of accurately diagnosing yourself from google? My god. This is such an incredibly stupid discussion. You can not self diagnose your own mental conditions, sorry, mate. There is absolutely no way you can be objective enough to do so.", "The point of this sub is to tell a one sided story yes... That's literally all the posts in this subreddit, they give their piece and explain what happened, why they think they might be the asshole, obviously they will always try to be seen as not the asshole. It's usually pretty easy to weed out assholes even if they make the post in their favour. And I didn't pull anything out of my ass? What do you think I said?", "Absolutely, it is all too easy to venture into hypochondriac territory if you\u2019re not cautious. Glad it makes sense to some people though", "Most people know themselves better than doctors and will be able to accurately self diagnose after being properly informed.\n\nAutism is not a \"mental condition.\" You have no idea what you're talking about and are just being ableist.", "Yeah, sure, lol, and usually, when the story is clearly incredibly biased like this one is, people have no issue calling them out for it... Also, my last sentence was obviously a generalised statement about all the NTA votes. Just go and read them to see what I mean...", "Agreed 100% some people really don\u2019t understand"]}
