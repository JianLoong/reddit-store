I have gotten cold sores a couple times a year since I was a kid, got it from my mom. Ultimately, what he is upset about is the fact that I did not explicitly tell him I have oral herpes earlier into the relationship since he is \u201cvery cautious\u201d about STDs. I don\u2019t have any STDs, and I had mentioned I had a cold sore months ago. I say it\u2019s his fault for not being more educated on something he is \u201cvery cautious\u201d about because he obviously has no idea what a cold sore is, what HSV-1 implies, and how it is contracted.

I take Lysine daily as well as an antiviral when I have outbreaks, and on top of that I avoid all contact because I have had this most my life and am careful about transmission.\n\nThe real question in all of this is, AITA not explicitly telling my partner that I have HSV-1 before I ever got a cold sore?", "created_utc": 1668678254, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxm1yk/aita_for_not_disclosing_i_have_oral_hsv1/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Though it still can be)", "NTA. I'm gonna say your bf is acting like an asshole but with a caveat. STIs are a common fear for many, and like you said, some people hear the word herpes and dont realize that HSV 1 connotes the oral and not the genital kind. While I get the fear from his end, him lashing out at you and accusing you of \"getting around\" is a red flag (if i were you) tbh. Everyone deserves respect, and this fear of his has unlocked some core slutshaming tactics. Definitely worth a conversation if you feel up to that.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s uninformed and making it your problem.\n\nFeKing out about you possibly cheating or \u2018getting around\u2019 is showing you he can\u2019t listen or stop being self-centred and judgemental in instances like this", "NTA.  The herpes virus is contracted in a bunch of different ways with different manifestations.  You have oral herpes, which is not sexually transmitted and is a evolutionarily different virus from the sexually transmitted one.   Chicken pox and shingles are also forms of herpes virus.  The 5yo I care for had chicken pox at 16 months old and she's not promiscuous at all, then or now. \n\nYour boyfriend sounds like he's the jealous type.  Take care that doesn't manifest in other areas of your life.  Neither he nor you had to come to the relationship with no sexual history and he has no right to judge you for past relationships (or vice versa)", "NTA. Something like over 50% of the world has HSV-1, even if it doesn't manifest as cold sores. It's also easy to transmit oral herpes by sharing drinks etc.\n\nI think he is just confused about what herpes is - eg doesn't realize there is a difference between oral and genital herpes. You said you had a cold sore also, so you did tell him. Not sure what he thinks cold sores are?", "NTA\n\nMassive over reaction from your BF. To immediately jump to saying you 'get around...' is ridiculous. It's not even an STI... massive red flag there I'm afraid.", "He\u2019s an ignorant fool. A large majority of people have this in their system but only some get coldsores. NTA and move on.", "Just send him an article to read which clearly explains what it is, that'd be much easier. You're NTA but communication is the most important part of a relationship and he clearly is not fully understanding your explanations.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is going to go berserk when he learns how many children get HSV-1 as toddlers. \n\nIf he\u2019s worried about genital herpes, there\u2019s an easy solution to that. No more BJs.

As evidenced by the number of people who have one not from sexual activity\u2026 NTA", "NTA. Millions of people get cold sores, and you get over the counter medicine for them. \n\nIf you had something like HIV, chlamydia, syphilis etc and had kept it quiet, then his reaction would be fair, but that's not the case here. \n\nYou'd had one before and told him. It's not your fault that he doesn't know what causes them.", "NTA. Your partner is uneducated - which isn\u2019t necessarily his fault but his reaction is from a place of fear and lack of knowledge. He needs to get over his fear, to the point where you can actually explain what Herpes is and there\u2019s a high chance he has it already. \n\nI struggled with OCD and was terrified of STDs, my husband gets cold sores. When he has an active one, I make him stay away \ud83d\ude02 but I understand the difference between a cold sore and a genuine STD. I realize I probably have it anyways.", "NTA but his reaction is ...yuck. Let's ignore the fact that he's confusing the oral with genital kind of h, who the hell jumps to \"oh you must get around\" when they hear someone has an STD? You could have been in a monogamous relationship and your partner cheated/lied about not having any STDs and got you infected. The truth is, he doesn't know the circumstances, and the proper response would have been to talk with you like an adult and get tested himself.", "NTA. You\u2019ve mentioned cold sores before.

I hope you\u2019ll take the time to be properly honest and make sure you guys are on the same page.
