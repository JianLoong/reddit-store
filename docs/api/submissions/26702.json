My parents have offered to take me and my fiance  abroad on a family holiday and pay for all the costs. The thing is there are a few catches. \n\n1. Me and my fiance would be responsible for my younger siblings (ranging from 1 to 7 year old) in terms of childcare as they all have special needs of some sort. \n \n2. We would have to sleep in separate rooms for the 2 weeks as they are spliting rhe rooms by gender, so 4 girls in one room and 5 boys in the other.. Bare in mind I have been with him for 5 years and living with him for 2 by that point 6 and 3. So as you can imagine that is not ideal.\n\nI don't feel like this is a treat like they seem to think it is. I wouldn't be able to have time alone with my partner at all and I want time to relax especially after 3 years of uni. I know what family holidays are like with them, I don't enjoy it. When I finished my GCSEs they took me away to 'celebrate' but then would shout at me if I did things I find relaxing because it's a waste of money for me to sit reading a book rather than spending all my time in the pool.\n\nBoth me and my partner do not want to go. We've discussed maybe doing something ourselves, but we're not sure. I just want one time in my life with them where I'm not a glorified babysitter. \n\nAnother issue is that they want to take us to the exact location we have chosen for our honeymoon and they know this. So that's a no no for us as we want our first time there to be special.\n\n\n\nEdit for some clarification and comments\n\nThe head count for each room includes my parents, me and my fiance. So in total there are 5 kids that would be going, 2 are old enough to be left to their own devices. In this situation I would be with the girls and my mum and my fiance would be with the boys and my dad. \n\nI just want to say thank you to everyone for validating my feelings and showing that I am not overreacting here, something that my parents told me I was doing at 16 when I first refused to go away with them because I was always the glorified babysitter. \n\nI will be having a convo with them to say that 1. We will not be going and 2. We will be doing our own thing for my graduation as that way I can enjoy it, after all these 3 years have been hard for me.\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nSo I have spoken to my mum and told her we will not be going because of the conditions and it not being what we want. Turns out she has booked it already for them and was going to add us if we wanted to come. But get this she has not only chosen our HONEYMOON location but also the exact hotel we was going to go to. I cant express how hurt I am because she knew that we wanted to go there as somewhere special for us but now if we go there on our honeymoon it won't feel as special because they went there first. \n\nShe seemed disappointed that we don't want to but didn't actually say anything other than ok, thought that would be the case.\n\nUPDATE 2\n\nAfter talking to my fiance, the absolute angel he is, we have decided that we will still go to the same country, just go to a different hotel and probably a different city. That way we can still do the activities we planned to do together. Yes it means adjusting the budget but it'll be worth it. I'm considering adult only hotels so there's no chance of them ruining it again. \n\nWe are not telling my parents about our wedding and honeymoon plans anymore as I don't want anymore drama over this. \n\nThank you everyone for your advice and reassurance. At least I know its not just me and my partner who think they're narcissists. \n\nI probably won't update again bc there's nothing else to say really.", "created_utc": 1694513603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16gngaa/wibta_if_i_said_no_to_a_paid_family_holiday/", "score": 377, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have there been any signs of that before? Also, the age difference between you and yor siblings is significant. Were you by chance the product of an unplanned teen/young pregnancy that seriously affected your parent's life?

Is it only the hotel? Or are they planning on doing the stuff you planned?", "I'd be tempted to choose a different location (or at least hotel for your Honeymoon", "Wait, let me get this straight, they\u2019re going to be at roughly the same location as you during your honeymoon? That is not just wrong, that\u2019s unhinged. You may want to think about going low contact for a bit with them until they can act appropriately. I would be so livid if I was your soon to be spouse.\n\nYour plan to go to an adult only hotel in another city is a great plan.", "Bad bot! Partial comment stolen from wandering_aimlessly9. Report and downvote!", "I think the parents were kind of thinking it was payment/ a partial gift. \"Look at this great thing we're doing \"to celebrate\" (with?) you. All you have to do besides graduate is pay us back by...\"", "Me and my partner chose our location that we want for our honeymoon, which is not booked yet. She has decided that now she wants to go on a family holiday there to the same hotel that we was going to go to.\n\nHonestly, my partner has expressed it and that's what's made me feel like I can stand up to them. We are both sick of them and as a result I have gone nc before when they've been horrid to my partner until they apologised and they've been very careful up until this point. However I think I will be going lc for now and see how that goes. As for giving them info on our wedding etc, they are not getting any at all.", "No, luckily, it's just where we decided to go right down to the hotel, we'd already decided not to tell them when we were going because we had a funny feeling they might try going at this same time.", "We've actually spoken about doing it with our kids one day as someone else suggested. As for my parents I think I might go low contact for a while as they fairly often try to guilt me into babysitting", "My mum was 20 when she had me and has always said she had tried for years for me, honestly I've always had doubts with how she treats me compared to my siblings. I do have siblings around my age 18 and 16 but the 16yo isn't going. I know she resents me in some way as it rushed her wedding so maybe she doesn't want me to make rhat mistake, she asked me so often if I'm sure I'm not pregnant especially if I say that I suddenly want something.", "Honestly idek I didn't ask because my brain shut off a little. All they said was that they'd tailored it all to them to do everything they'd wanted to do", "This is actually the reason why we've refused to have anyone have a financial stake in our wedding. I don't want anyone to have a say in our day other than me and my fiance. After all its our day. Yes its meant we've been saving up for 2 years so far but it'll be worth it  I think that's partly what upset me about their choice, they knew we've been saving for it and now we've decided that we're going to see if we can budget to go elsewhere", "Not during our honeymoon, that's not actually booked yet. But they have chosen to go to the hotel that we was planning on going to. So yes now our plan is to go elsewhere because I don't want any accusations that we copied them or anything like that", "I'm in agreement with you on everything, *except* the idea that an entire future honeymoon destination is ruined for you because your family visited it first, without you. Surely you must realize that there is literally nowhere you could go for your honeymoon that will not have been visited by countless other people first. *What makes a honeymoon special is the person who's on it with you,* not the uniqueness of the destination (because, as I said, no destination will ever be unique to you; many other people will have been there before you). You really need to get over that.", "Maybe do a few different things, then you were planning if possible. That way either when they get back, or when you get back. In case she does, she can\u2019t say you did the same stuff we did.", "If you choose another place, make sure to lie and tell your parents it is a different one. That will be easier for keeping the real one a secret and they might yet try to sabotage the new (fake) one too.", "Luckily I hadn't told her all of our plans activity wise, we have got activities that I know she would hate planned :)", "That\u2019s good at least! Has she done stuff like this before? Or is this a first?", "This is a first but honestly it's the first time we've planned anything big like this for us", "NTA. That isn\u2019t a gift; it\u2019s a job. A gig.", "NTA but all I'm going to say is never go on vacation with them again; they don't see you as anything but a babysitter and never will.", "NTA and if they truly thought it was a treat for you that wouldn't be a problem. In fact it would be better than not saying and not enjoying it etc. They'd suggest or ask if there's something else that you would like instead.", "This is not a holiday, this is you being an unpaid carer, it's an utter piss take, don't go.", "Well, this doesn\u2019t sound like a family holiday. It sounds like your parents are going on a holiday, and taking the kids plus childcare with them. \n\nDon\u2019t go. \ud83d\udc95\n\nNTA.", ">My parents have offered to take me and my fiance abroad on a family holiday and pay for all the costs.\n\n>Me and my fiance would be responsible for my younger siblings (ranging from 1 to 7 year old) in terms of childcare as they all have special needs of some sort.\n\nHahahaha. No. Good job shutting that down OP. NTA.", "NTA.\nGood on you for standing your ground.\n\n\"...it won't feel as special because they went there first.\"\nIt would be special because it is your honeymoon! So what if your family has been there already? What makes something special is what it means to you, not because it is exclusively yours.", "You\u2019re not being treated. You\u2019re the travel nanny.", "Yeah, it's just a treat *for the parents*.", "When I was single and my sister's kids were young, her ex would go to a lot of conventions, so we would come along if it was a family friendly area. Like Orlando. He would be out at the convention, so I'd help my sister with the kids at Disney or wherever. I really enjoyed it. It wasn't what I'd choose for a vacation if I were paying for it, but since they always covered everything, I had a great time. I didn't get the kids dumped on me all the time, they weren't partiers anyway so I'd go out in the evening because they'd be back at the hotel with the kids. (Hell, sometimes I'd find a bar at the Disney resort and charge my drinks back to the room. Many drinks were had at the Gurgling Suitcase!) And I liked spending time with the kids. Great excuse for going to children's museums and things like that--children's museums are awesome. Sometimes I'd stay with the older kid while my sister took the younger one back to the hotel for a nap or a quiet afternoon at the pool. Disney can be very overwhelming for very little kids, especially when it's super hot, but a lot of parents ignore it because they're so determined to get their money's worth. I hate when I see that, the parents and older kids still raring to go but the little kids are stuffed in a stroller in a stupor with tear tracks down their faces because they're being ignored.", "Post a couple of decoy places in your social media. There are so many ways (and people) to find out the real honeymoon site.", "It's not all the other people, it's her parents in particular."]}
