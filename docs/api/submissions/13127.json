{"id": 13127, "submission_id": "1216c3c", "title": "AITA for reporting the maintenance man for letting himself into our apt?", "selftext": "My apt unit consists of me and 3 other young women. As such, we are wary of making sure our doors are always locked. One of my roommates is particularly afraid of intruders and doesn\u2019t even let me keep our bedroom window open at night because she is afraid someone may come in through it.\n\nThe other day, one of my roommates overslept a bit. She had a flight to catch in the afternoon, and when she didn\u2019t answer her mom\u2019s calls, her mom ended up calling our building manager. The manager sent us an email letting us know that her mom was trying to get ahold of her. None of us saw this email until much later.\n\nAbout an hour after it was sent, her mom called again and asked for someone to knock on the door and check on/get ahold of my roommate. She never explicitly asked for anyone to come into the unit. This time the building manager sent the maintenance man up to knock on our door. He knocked on our front door while two of my roommates and I were sleeping. He honestly banged so hard it woke me up, and then proceeded to let himself inside when we didn\u2019t answer, only to knock on my bedroom door. I was sleeping and partially unclothed so I did not answer the door for him.\n\nHe then banged on my roommates\u2019 bedroom door. They said they yelled multiple times who it was and he did not answer for some reason. They opened the door for him. He did \u201chelp\u201d in the sense that he ensured my roommate caught her flight in time, but there is a good chance she would have caught it regardless, since she still had hours to catch it at that point, her mom was simply overreacting.\n\nI think the maintenance man really overstepped by entering our unit without our permission and that if it was truly an urgent matter, the building manager should have at least tried calling us first. Most of the time my roommates don\u2019t sleep in clothing, and it would have been particularly violating if they had been unclothed when he came in. It is not okay for a grown man to enter our space unannounced and knock on our bedroom doors.\n\nWe have been friendly with him when he has fixed things in the past and I feel that he thinks we will be okay with him overstepping boundaries simply because we are young, nice girls. In the past he has used a few of our items without asking us and continued to use them even after we noticed and asked him not to, and I get the sense that he thinks we will let him be in our space. He is a kind man and I do think he is well-meaning, but this is too far. I emailed the building manager about it and she was receptive and apologized, saying she had no idea that he had let himself in and has made it clear to him that it\u2019s not okay to do so. He was not asked to do this by anyone. In my state (CA) it is also illegal to come in this way without prior notice.\n\nI posted this on another subreddit and I was surprised by the amount of people who were defending the maintenance guy. Now I am wondering if we overreacted in reporting his behavior. AITA?\n\nEdit 3: I will put this at the top because people keep saying it. No one asked for a wellness check. The mother did not ask for that, and the manager did not ask for that. The mother asked them to knock on our door and check on/get ahold of her daughter. There was no imminent danger, she just thought her daughter was going to sleep through her flight. The amount of people saying this was a wellness check are not understanding that nothing indicated this was an emergency situation. It was a \u201cyour mom\u2019s calling you, call her back\u201d level of urgency\n\nEdit: I will say that we truly do not get any creepy vibes from this guy. He is a nice guy who has daughters our age and has never made us feel creeped out. We think he is just not aware of how intrusive this can seem from our point of view\n\nEdit 2: The mother and the manager both did not ask him to come into our unit. Both of them were surprised to hear that he let himself in. I don\u2019t know if it was a misunderstanding and he thought that he was supposed to, but he was not and is not authorized to do so, even if he means well.\n\nYes, I could have opened the door for him when I heard him banging on the front door. When I was woken by him I wasn\u2019t fully awake, I was drifting in and out of a dream and I don\u2019t always think clearly when I\u2019m half asleep. I can see how this makes me irresponsible, but I truly was just kind of asleep. I was more awake when he knocked on my bedroom door, but I was partially unclothed and did not want to get up and change when someone could open the door, and as I have said, we did not even know who it was. I had a feeling it was him because he has a key into our place but not a sure confirmation. My roommates didn\u2019t hear him until he was banging on their bedroom doors. I don\u2019t think it is fair to say my roommate was irresponsible because she was perfectly capable of catching her flight without this intervention", "created_utc": 1679708211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1216c3c/aita_for_reporting_the_maintenance_man_for/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was then up to the concerned party to decide if they wanted to contact the police. I, for one, never wanted to walk in and see a dead body so I wasn\u2019t going in apartments unless absolutely necessary. Either way, I would check the lease and see when it says staff can enter.

If someone is POUNDING on my door, I assume there's a good fucking reason for it. I wouldn't just ignore it. Grab some sweatpants and a top, throw on a robe, whatever- but answer the damn door because SOMEONE is obviously trying to get in touch with you for some reason. \n\nWild example- but in 2021 there was a MASSIVE wildfire in my city and 1,100 homes and businesses burned to their foundations in a matter of hours.

They didn't use sirens or reverse 911 calls, so if you didn't happen to have the news on you wouldn't know. So they were going door to door pounding on doors telling people there was fire coming. \n\nPeople don't just show up and pound on your door for no reason. \n\nI mean, black and white, no he shouldn't have let himself into the apartment. He should have gotten the manager or called emergency services or whatever.

He wasn't even the person to talk to the mother, right? So who knows what the story was that he heard. \n\nBut still- if he's sent there and he's banging on the door and no one is answering, I can understand why he might be afraid something bad had happened. What if y'all were tied up and being held hostage and he just knocked and walked away? I know that's a ridiculous stretch, but that's where your mind goes- either a gas leak and you're all passed out, or someone hurt you in the night, or something like that. \n\nShould he have handled it differently?

They\u2019d probably find a reason to be mad if you did answer the door!", "[deleted]", "ESH. you have no idea what your roommate\u2019s mom told the landlord/maintenance man that may have made them think it **was** an emergency. He shouldn\u2019t have let himself in, but how hard was it to answer the door after you admitted that the pounding woke you up?", "I don't know. Check on/get a hold of (quote: The mother asked them to knock on our door and **check on/get ahold** of her daughter) implies to me 'make sure to see her'.\n\nAnd knowing there are FOUR women in there and NO ONE is answering even an hour after a reasonable hour (because management sent an email certainly no earlier than business hours)... I'd probably get a bit worried. But I'd call the cops. Bad judgment on maintenance man's part.\n\nNAH... except maybe panicking mom. I mean, really, her daughter no longer lives in her house. Her daughter has her independence. She can make her own d\\*mn flight.\n\nETA: NAH... just massive amounts of stup\\*dity by everyone concerned.", "Are y\u2019all not reading right? HE DID NOT IDENTIFY WHO HE WAS.\n\nWomen are ALWAYS on the alert with these sort of things. There was no emergency, nor a suggestion of one. There were 3 OTHER PEOPLE in the apartment. This behavior was totally unnecessary, and would absolutely be cause for panic for young women barely dressed in their beds. You\u2019re not really thinking, \u201cI wish I had a robe\u201d when you\u2019re waking up to someone in your apartment, banging on doors, with your roommates yelling asking them who they were, and getting no answer.\n\nSome pretty narrow and ignorant comments in this thread. These womens\u2019 space was encroached upon while they were in vulnerable states.\n\nOf course, NTA", "Nta anyone saying otherwise is ridiculous", "YTA I understand your reasoning, but he wouldn\u2019t have came into your apartment without your mom calling him.  I totally get the he wasn\u2019t asked to physically enter the apartment but this should be categorized under misunderstandings happen. Not on his record like he is a sleepy perv who is breaking the law and must be fired.", "NTA - Dude overstepped his bounds, and is lucky none of you straight up shot him thinking he was an intruder. I'm surprised your roommate doesn't have one of [these](https://amzn.to/3nmqUXh) on every external door.", "It's all so super fucking dangerous. I keep a literal 10-in dagger next to my bed if some random person was pounding on my bedroom door and I treated it as the threat I thought it was that would not end well. But also like roll one of doing a wellness check is to fucking announce who it is and what it is. Like you don't properly step foot into the living space without yelling out what the fuck is going on. \n\n\nAlso entering without notice is illegal in most places.", "This is illegal where I am too. He is not supposed to come in unless there is a health/safety concern", "As a young woman being alone at home if someone bangs the door like an animal Im not opening it\nEdit: and he is a landlord, if he wants to do a welfare check because he thinks something bad happened he can contact services that *can* do just that.", "How is this at the top? Honestly OP is NTA but you might be.", "Partially unclothed you dumbass.", "It did feel violating to have someone come inside and knock on our bedroom doors. It\u2019s not okay and I\u2019m surprised so many people are defending this", "I don\u2019t have any ill feeling towards this guy, but I do feel uncomfortable with the situation. I know he was acting out of good faith but that does not make it okay for him to come in and knock on our bedroom doors. If we can\u2019t dictate who comes in and out of our unit we have autonomy over our privacy", "We thought long and hard about reporting that but decided not to ultimately because at the end of the day we didn\u2019t want to get him in trouble, he has been kind to us and he\u2019s the only person we have to fix things so it\u2019s just better to be on good terms with him, though now we may not have the best terms after this. But yes, I really did feel like it was a complete overstepping of boundaries to let himself in, and to do so in such a disruptive way. I know not everyone feels this way because so many people think this was a \u201cwellness check\u201d but I don\u2019t believe it was warranted", "I think what people are also missing is that we were never called or texted, which I should be the next step in an emergency situation. Jumping straight to banging on the front door after sending an email is just going from 0 to 100 in terms of communication", "I\u2019m glad he\u2019s an ex-husband\u2026 I don\u2019t understand how people can\u2019t put themselves in the shoes of someone who feels like they are being intruded on, which is how all of us felt after this scenario played out. Also, I like your way of storytelling", "For wellness checks you call the police, not the maintenance guy", "so if you don't answer your door its anyones right to walk in in because for all they know, you could be dead??", "No, this is an apartment, not affiliated with a school", "No, you misread a lot of my post it seems. First off, the mother never asked for them to come inside, she asked them to knock on our front door. The manager did not ask the maintenance guy to come inside, she asked him to knock, which is what the mother asked for. And before opening their bedroom door to him, my roommates had asked multiple times who it was and gotten zero response. I\u2019m not a heavy sleeper and I have little to do with this scenario, but I was not fully awake when it was taking place because my sleep was very abruptly interrupted, so I was not in a fully conscious state of mind to think I should open the front door to him", "I have said this before but I\u2019m not fully conscious when I have just woken up. I woke up when he first started pounding on the door and drifted into a dream immediately after. I don\u2019t always make the best decisions when I\u2019m in this half-awake state. I can\u2019t even say how long he was knocking because I really did fall back into sleep almost immediately after. I\u2019m sorry if you experience sleep differently than I do but I have to set multiple alarms before I can actually wake up, I can\u2019t be woken in a jarring way. From what the mother and the manager both said, he was told to knock on the door to check on her, but never to come in. He may have interpreted this differently, I don\u2019t know", "I mean there has to be a point of limit. Even if I had the keys to someone\u2019s place, if I knocked on their door and they didn\u2019t answer, that should be the end of it. If there were true reason for concern, then he should maybe be coming in, but in the absence of danger, absolutely not", "I\u2019ve had maintenance let themselves into my apartment before. It\u2019s really uncomfortable. \n\nWe told management something was broken, and they said they\u2019d eventually come look at it and let us know when to expect maintenance. No one got back to us. Maintenance has a protocol to knock twice and ring the doorbell before entering. Dude didn\u2019t do that. I was in the shower, but I hear the doorbell over my shower no problem. I walked out of my bathroom to see a man I don\u2019t know sitting on my kitchen counter watching YouTube (not maintenance related) on his phone. I was home alone in just a towel staring at a stranger in my kitchen. It was super freaky.", "I mean.. that should be at the top of your post. That is kinda important.", "I agree with you. I work in a job where we perform wellness checks. 1. You should always have a witness with you. Going into a place alone could be dangerous for you physically and legally\u2014for multiple reasons. Just recording as you go may land you into even more hot water. 2. The maintenance man is not trained for this, by any stretch of the imagination. He also does not have the legal right to enter your domecile regardless if they have the keys or not. That violates tenant law.\n\nIn the real world please let emergency services handle a wellness check. If there is a mental instability you could be walking into something gruesome or life threatening and do not have the skills, training, or tools to deal with that. The police and EMS do. (but if the last few years have taught me anything, there should be an agency outside of police to do mental health and wellness checks.)\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s very clear from your comments that this situation was not appropriate for a wellness check, he was not asked by management to enter for a wellness check, and there was no suggestion that anyone\u2019s health or safety was in question. \n\nEven if he was actually doing a legitimate wellness check, his behaviour is weird and inappropriate. Why did any of you even have to ask who was banging on their bedroom door? Why was he not clearly announcing who he was and why he was there? It sounds like, even if his intentions were good, he went about this in the creepiest way possible, short of entering your bedrooms.\n\nI\u2019ve had someone enter my home, with permission from my landlord, but without any legally required notice, while I was sleeping. It was fucking terrifying, and felt like such a deep violation. \n\nPlease talk to the building manager about this. Even if he 100% has good intentions, he needs to be trained in how to appropriately and legally interact with tenants and their property, before he does some thing that gets him into serious trouble.", "Your beef is with management. Do you seriously not understand how this works? The maintenance staff member follows the instructions given by his employer. You are not his boss.", "Just curious because it sounds like you\u2019re sharing bedrooms, which is unusual. A dorm could explain why mgmt is up in your business", "I did include that somewhere in the post, it is an illegal entry. I think in scenarios like this people are more concerned with what is morally right than what is legal", "It\u2019s a $20-$30 item that spends a lot of time in your mouth. Of course he shouldn\u2019t have used it for a plumbing project", "How would he have established if there was a need for concern? I mean the mom called the office TWICE and asked someone to check it out. The blame here is solely on your room mate who fucked up and didnt answer calls or door knocks. and you who ignore the door knocks. Not the good samaritan who was asked to check out a concern. Like seriously - how the hell would he know *either way*? it could have been serious. You dont know how the mom made it sound.\n\nYTA. giant.", "I have spoken to the manager already, as I stated in the post I wrote her an email. She said she no had idea this had happened and was sorry that it did, and that she spoke with him and told him that it wasn\u2019t okay to do. I had some guilt in reporting this because In the future, if someone really does need a wellness check, I hope that they would receive it. I just also hope that scenarios like this where one is not warranted don\u2019t continue to play out", "The instruction he was given was not to go inside, but to knock. The manager had no idea he had come inside until I sent the email about it and spoke to her", "Yeah, we share bedrooms, two in each room. Why is that unusual?", "why would they call when the reason this started was BECAUSE THEY DIDNT ANSWER A CALL.", "I honestly can't find the illegal part. Only mention I could find was that he didn't had your permission which doesn't mean that's illegal.", "Non-neurotic people would just wash it.", "I\u2019m seriously a giant asshole for not opening the door to a stranger who is banging on it when I\u2019m half asleep?", "The guy wasn't just banging on the front door, he was banging on her bedroom door. If a stranger knocked on my bedroom door and I knew no one had let him in, there is no way I would answer.", "That\u2019s the one. It came within less than a mile from my place. I am beyond grateful that there was no damage to my house. It was a very nerve wracking couple of days. I evacuated to Boulder, and then I couldn\u2019t get out of Boulder for 2 days bc we got a ton of snow and I was stuck. So I didn\u2019t know if there would be smoke damage or burst pipes or what. Thankfully everything was fine.\n\nBut it was devastating to drive by it every day. Still is. It took something like 6 months before most lots were cleared if debris and ready to be built on again.

He didn\u2019t damage or destroy anything important of yours but if he thinks it\u2019s okay to just grab the belongings of tenants in the future he could be accused of theft or be held responsible for damaging something expensive or irreplaceable. \n\nYou can raise this concern in a way that emphasizes that you don\u2019t want to get him in trouble. Doing so could save him from getting fired in the future and it could save other tenants from having their personal belongings damaged. \n\nPlease don\u2019t feel guilty for reporting him entering your home. The building management will have policies and procedures for performing a wellness check in an appropriate and legal way if it is needed in the future.
