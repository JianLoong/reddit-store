{"id": 13127, "submission_id": "1216c3c", "title": "AITA for reporting the maintenance man for letting himself into our apt?", "selftext": "My apt unit consists of me and 3 other young women. As such, we are wary of making sure our doors are always locked. One of my roommates is particularly afraid of intruders and doesn\u2019t even let me keep our bedroom window open at night because she is afraid someone may come in through it.\n\nThe other day, one of my roommates overslept a bit. She had a flight to catch in the afternoon, and when she didn\u2019t answer her mom\u2019s calls, her mom ended up calling our building manager. The manager sent us an email letting us know that her mom was trying to get ahold of her. None of us saw this email until much later.\n\nAbout an hour after it was sent, her mom called again and asked for someone to knock on the door and check on/get ahold of my roommate. She never explicitly asked for anyone to come into the unit. This time the building manager sent the maintenance man up to knock on our door. He knocked on our front door while two of my roommates and I were sleeping. He honestly banged so hard it woke me up, and then proceeded to let himself inside when we didn\u2019t answer, only to knock on my bedroom door. I was sleeping and partially unclothed so I did not answer the door for him.\n\nHe then banged on my roommates\u2019 bedroom door. They said they yelled multiple times who it was and he did not answer for some reason. They opened the door for him. He did \u201chelp\u201d in the sense that he ensured my roommate caught her flight in time, but there is a good chance she would have caught it regardless, since she still had hours to catch it at that point, her mom was simply overreacting.\n\nI think the maintenance man really overstepped by entering our unit without our permission and that if it was truly an urgent matter, the building manager should have at least tried calling us first. Most of the time my roommates don\u2019t sleep in clothing, and it would have been particularly violating if they had been unclothed when he came in. It is not okay for a grown man to enter our space unannounced and knock on our bedroom doors.\n\nWe have been friendly with him when he has fixed things in the past and I feel that he thinks we will be okay with him overstepping boundaries simply because we are young, nice girls. In the past he has used a few of our items without asking us and continued to use them even after we noticed and asked him not to, and I get the sense that he thinks we will let him be in our space. He is a kind man and I do think he is well-meaning, but this is too far. I emailed the building manager about it and she was receptive and apologized, saying she had no idea that he had let himself in and has made it clear to him that it\u2019s not okay to do so. He was not asked to do this by anyone. In my state (CA) it is also illegal to come in this way without prior notice.\n\nI posted this on another subreddit and I was surprised by the amount of people who were defending the maintenance guy. Now I am wondering if we overreacted in reporting his behavior. AITA?\n\nEdit: I will say that we truly do not get any creepy vibes from this guy. He is a nice guy who has daughters our age and has never made us feel creeped out. We think he is just not aware of how intrusive this can seem from our point of view\n\nEdit 2: The mother and the manager both did not ask him to come into our unit. Both of them were surprised to hear that he let himself in. I don\u2019t know if it was a misunderstanding and he thought that he was supposed to, but he was not and is not authorized to do so, even if he means well.\n\nYes, I could have opened the door for him when I heard him banging on the front door. When I was woken by him I wasn\u2019t fully awake, I was drifting in and out of a dream and I don\u2019t always think clearly when I\u2019m half asleep. I can see how this makes me irresponsible, but I truly was just kind of asleep. I was more awake when he knocked on my bedroom door, but I was partially unclothed and did not want to get up and change when someone could open the door, and as I have said, we did not even know who it was. I had a feeling it was him because he has a key into our place but not a sure confirmation. My roommates didn\u2019t hear him until he was banging on their bedroom doors. I don\u2019t think it is fair to say my roommate was irresponsible because she was perfectly capable of catching her flight without this intervention", "created_utc": 1679708211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1216c3c/aita_for_reporting_the_maintenance_man_for/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What if something terrible *had* befallen one of you girls and he'd been the only one there to find it and save a life?? \n\nWas roomie's mom overreacting? Most likely.

The only part that surprises me is that management didn't call the police to be there as well. They really should have. The maintenance man was probably not told to only knock and not enter. He was sent over to see what was going on because a mom was calling repeatedly.\n\nI had two friends pass away unexpectedly in their apartments in their 20s. It happens more than people realize.

Most apartment complexes have rules for when someone can/cannot enter an apartment and it is outlined in the lease. When I used to work in property management, if we had to do a wellness check we would knock on the door and if no one answered, we would report that back. It was then up to the concerned party to decide if they wanted to contact the police. I, for one, never wanted to walk in and see a dead body so I wasn\u2019t going in apartments unless absolutely necessary. Either way, I would check the lease and see when it says staff can enter. If it says they can come in for wellness checks without giving notice, then he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

He was fixing a leak in our place once in the past, and he took one of our water bottles off the dish rack to catch the leak when it got worse. Later on that same day, my roommate saw him using her meat knife to saw into the ceiling. She asked him to please not do that, and he said okay, but she later caught him still using it to saw into the ceiling.

He also used our trash can to catch the leak when it started practically raining (that we didn\u2019t mind since trash cans are inherently kind of dirty anyways).

I\u2019m surprised they even opened their bedroom door to him when he did not answer their asking who it was. They knew it was not me or our other roommate because we never bang, we only ever knock.

If someone is POUNDING on my door, I assume there's a good fucking reason for it. I wouldn't just ignore it. Grab some sweatpants and a top, throw on a robe, whatever- but answer the damn door because SOMEONE is obviously trying to get in touch with you for some reason. \n\nWild example- but in 2021 there was a MASSIVE wildfire in my city and 1,100 homes and businesses burned to their foundations in a matter of hours. Rescue workers were going door to door informing people that there was a mandatory evacuation because most of us had no idea about the fire. They didn't use sirens or reverse 911 calls, so if you didn't happen to have the news on you wouldn't know. So they were going door to door pounding on doors telling people there was fire coming. \n\nPeople don't just show up and pound on your door for no reason. \n\nI mean, black and white, no he shouldn't have let himself into the apartment. He should have gotten the manager or called emergency services or whatever. But all he knew was one of your parents was trying to get in touch, no one was answering, and when pounded and pounded no one came to the door. \n\nHE didn't know it was just a flight. He wasn't even the person to talk to the mother, right? So who knows what the story was that he heard. \n\nBut still- if he's sent there and he's banging on the door and no one is answering, I can understand why he might be afraid something bad had happened. What if y'all were tied up and being held hostage and he just knocked and walked away? I know that's a ridiculous stretch, but that's where your mind goes- either a gas leak and you're all passed out, or someone hurt you in the night, or something like that. \n\nShould he have handled it differently? Probably. But, um, you definitely should have, too.", "It doesn't matter how many times you ask the same question. You're second-guessing yourself for a reason.

At least in this case. He was doing what he was asked to do... he didn't actually enter any of the rooms if I understood this correctly. He wasn't actively trying to do anything overtly creepy. It sounds as if he might have genuinely been concerned for your safety and well-being. You've never had negative interactions with him, and you said it yourself, he is a nice guy.

She has the right to sleep for as long as she wants. On weekends i wake up at noon because i want. No one should police your sleep/life", "Then hopefully there's never a huge fire or disaster in your building or town, because if you're too lazy to get your ass out of bed, dying would be your own fault.   NATURAL SELECTION,", "Your roommates parent asked for a wellness check and the property manager told him to do it. You also ignored the knocking.", "You can argue all day about it and you\u2019ll still be TA for getting a worker in trouble for doing a wellness check. We should all be so lucky to have people in our neighborhoods who care enough to make sure we aren\u2019t dying from a gas leak. \nBuy your roommate an alarm clock and answer your door like a damn adult.", "Look... cold hard truth? If he wanted to invade your privacy... you'd never know he did. He certainly wouldn't stand outside banging on a door to do it. You got the man in trouble for no reason. He got in trouble to calm down a frantic mother. I don't know many men that wouldn't do the same. You're asking if it was wrong to throw a glass of water on the person that brought you the water you asked them to get. Idk how else to explain this, you fucked up and you want to feel better about it... well sometimes you can't. You want affirmation that you did the right thing... it's fairly clear you didn't, or you wouldn't have to ask if you did. There's legally right, and then there is morally right.", "You said it was used for a leak. That is not construction.", "i think your roommate's mom overstepped her boundaries here imo. if her grown kid misses a flight, good, let them learn. parents can't prevent things from happening, they should let their kids learn how to be responsible.", "JFC\n\nI have a mother like that. \"If you don't answer the phone I will get police involved\". All usually centered around incidents of forgetting to charge a phone overnight or having it on silent at inconvenient times. Oh, and by the way, timezones don't exist. It never actually got to police, but it did get to unannounced visit from my realtor once and from my landlord another time (all were familiar to my family, but still 3rd parties).\n\nThe whole post is misleading. You may be young, but you are technically adults who rent the flat and YOU are responsible for this issue with an unhinged relative. Maintenance guy was simply at the end of it all and you owe him an apology for the awkward situation, not a report FFS.\n\nESH", "[deleted]", "Right? I don\u2019t think the fact that it\u2019s noon should be a key detail here. People sleep/nap anytime they want to", "[deleted]", "Im fine! I live with family and we take care of each other. The house is safe enough and we have alarms and security.", "I see your perspective a lot, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s so black and white here. At the end of the day, a person should not be making the call to come into your home. It\u2019s intrusive. I don\u2019t have such a fear of men, but I am wary of them, and I think that most women are for very good reason. I don\u2019t think he is someone creepy that had bad intention, but the sole fact that he is a man realistically will make us more uncomfortable than if a woman had entered our space in this same way. That\u2019s just a reality, and you can\u2019t tell someone how comfortable they should or shouldn\u2019t feel with something", "Dude seriously? A leak is super gross. That water was not clean enough to go into a water bottle that someone drinks out of", "I really agree there. I think the mom should have let her be, but even more I think the building manager should have said there was nothing she could do to help. She doesn\u2019t need to entertain it further by actually sending someone up to knock on our door when asked to", "I don\u2019t know if it was really right for the manager to even entertain the situation with the mother calling, and I think she should have called us before sending someone to knock on our door. I don\u2019t intend for this post to be misleading, I think I am being transparent in answering questions and not leaving information out", "She was up until 7 am packing because she finished packing then? I don\u2019t really know what to say to that really. It was a domestic flight. She doesn\u2019t have a history of missing flights. Her mom was really just overreacting", "They performed Olympic level mental gymnastics to reach that conclusion lol", "You have no idea who paid for the flight. Even if the mum had paid it still doesn\u2019t give the maintenance guy the right to let himself into their apartment.", "Then perhaps you shouldn't feel bad by your own admission for what you did. Doesn't truly seem like you do, so no real point in asking about it on here. Is there? For the record, I never told you you had to be comfortable with anything. I said it seems like you have skewed views.  So, in short feel bad, or don't feel bad. You still did what you did, and now someone else has to pay the price. It's pretty simple. It's also pretty petty.", "Hmm. Does building management replace a water bottle because of a leak or replace a floor. Think.", "I'd blame the mom and the manager honestly. Not the lowly maintenance guy just trying to keep his job by listening to his boss.", "[deleted]", "I mean okay, I did make this post because I was wondering if I went about things the right way, and I think it\u2019s clear that people seem to have varying and often polarized views on it. I never intended to harm him so much as just speak on this so that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Knowing the dynamic of the building, the manager and the maintenance guy are on very good terms, and I am fairly certain this would not actually hurt his position so much as just get him reprimanded and made aware. I was not trying to be petty. Would you have actually been okay with this if it had happened to you?", "The manager never asked him to come in though. I haven\u2019t spoken to him about it, so I haven\u2019t heard his side, but the mom and the manager have both said what was requested was for someone to knock to check, not to come inside. But yes, I know he was just doing what he thought was asked of him. I honestly do feel bad for speaking on it because I know he shouldn\u2019t have come in but I also know he meant well", "The boss asked him to go and knock on their front door\u2026 not let himself into their home.", "Probably never occurred to you to ask the maintenance guy a simple question. Most likely, it would have avoided the whole mishap, answered your questions, and given the guy a chance to apologize for the intrusion and misunderstanding, as well as assure you it wouldn't happen again. Might have been too simple. Huh... I might have to try this technique on the next manager I come across and see if it gets me something free for a month too. Hope you found whatever you needed to in the comments to ease your conscience, while the maintenance dude rethinks ever coming to your apartment again. Yikes...", "[deleted]", "Knocked on the front door and then told building management that no one had answered. \n\nGo back and read further along\u2026 the building manager said that they were not aware and had not authorised the maintenance guy to access the property."]}
