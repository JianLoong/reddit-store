{"id": 13127, "submission_id": "1216c3c", "title": "AITA for reporting the maintenance man for letting himself into our apt?", "selftext": "My apt unit consists of me and 3 other young women. As such, we are wary of making sure our doors are always locked. One of my roommates is particularly afraid of intruders and doesn\u2019t even let me keep our bedroom window open at night because she is afraid someone may come in through it.\n\nThe other day, one of my roommates overslept a bit. She had a flight to catch in the afternoon, and when she didn\u2019t answer her mom\u2019s calls, her mom ended up calling our building manager. The manager sent us an email letting us know that her mom was trying to get ahold of her. None of us saw this email until much later.\n\nAbout an hour after it was sent, her mom called again and asked for someone to knock on the door and check on/get ahold of my roommate. She never explicitly asked for anyone to come into the unit. This time the building manager sent the maintenance man up to knock on our door. He knocked on our front door while two of my roommates and I were sleeping. He honestly banged so hard it woke me up, and then proceeded to let himself inside when we didn\u2019t answer, only to knock on my bedroom door. I was sleeping and partially unclothed so I did not answer the door for him.\n\nHe then banged on my roommates\u2019 bedroom door. They said they yelled multiple times who it was and he did not answer for some reason. They opened the door for him. He did \u201chelp\u201d in the sense that he ensured my roommate caught her flight in time, but there is a good chance she would have caught it regardless, since she still had hours to catch it at that point, her mom was simply overreacting.\n\nI think the maintenance man really overstepped by entering our unit without our permission and that if it was truly an urgent matter, the building manager should have at least tried calling us first. Most of the time my roommates don\u2019t sleep in clothing, and it would have been particularly violating if they had been unclothed when he came in. It is not okay for a grown man to enter our space unannounced and knock on our bedroom doors.\n\nWe have been friendly with him when he has fixed things in the past and I feel that he thinks we will be okay with him overstepping boundaries simply because we are young, nice girls. In the past he has used a few of our items without asking us and continued to use them even after we noticed and asked him not to, and I get the sense that he thinks we will let him be in our space. He is a kind man and I do think he is well-meaning, but this is too far. I emailed the building manager about it and she was receptive and apologized, saying she had no idea that he had let himself in and has made it clear to him that it\u2019s not okay to do so. He was not asked to do this by anyone. In my state (CA) it is also illegal to come in this way without prior notice.\n\nI posted this on another subreddit and I was surprised by the amount of people who were defending the maintenance guy. Now I am wondering if we overreacted in reporting his behavior. AITA?\n\nEdit 4: the mother did tell the manager that it was a flight that she was calling about. I know this 100% for sure because in the email she initially sent us, she mentioned that it was about the flight. I can only assume that the maintenance man knew this as well, which gives me reason to think he did not think this was an emergency\n\nEdit 3: I will put this at the top because people keep saying it. No one asked for a wellness check. The mother did not ask for that, and the manager did not ask for that. The mother asked them to knock on our door and check on/get ahold of her daughter. There was no imminent danger, she just thought her daughter was going to sleep through her flight. The amount of people saying this was a wellness check are not understanding that nothing indicated this was an emergency situation. It was a \u201cyour mom\u2019s calling you, call her back\u201d level of urgency\n\nEdit: I will say that we truly do not get any creepy vibes from this guy. He is a nice guy who has daughters our age and has never made us feel creeped out. We think he is just not aware of how intrusive this can seem from our point of view\n\nEdit 2: The mother and the manager both did not ask him to come into our unit. Both of them were surprised to hear that he let himself in. I don\u2019t know if it was a misunderstanding and he thought that he was supposed to, but he was not and is not authorized to do so, even if he means well.\n\nYes, I could have opened the door for him when I heard him banging on the front door. When I was woken by him I wasn\u2019t fully awake, I was drifting in and out of a dream and I don\u2019t always think clearly when I\u2019m half asleep. I can see how this makes me irresponsible, but I truly was just kind of asleep. I was more awake when he knocked on my bedroom door, but I was partially unclothed and did not want to get up and change when someone could open the door, and as I have said, we did not even know who it was. I had a feeling it was him because he has a key into our place but not a sure confirmation. My roommates didn\u2019t hear him until he was banging on their bedroom doors. I don\u2019t think it is fair to say my roommate was irresponsible because she was perfectly capable of catching her flight without this intervention", "created_utc": 1679708211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1216c3c/aita_for_reporting_the_maintenance_man_for/", "score": 743, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She asked him to please not do that, and he said okay, but she later caught him still using it to saw into the ceiling.

If someone is POUNDING on my door, I assume there's a good fucking reason for it. I wouldn't just ignore it. Grab some sweatpants and a top, throw on a robe, whatever- but answer the damn door because SOMEONE is obviously trying to get in touch with you for some reason. \n\nWild example- but in 2021 there was a MASSIVE wildfire in my city and 1,100 homes and businesses burned to their foundations in a matter of hours. Rescue workers were going door to door informing people that there was a mandatory evacuation because most of us had no idea about the fire. They didn't use sirens or reverse 911 calls, so if you didn't happen to have the news on you wouldn't know. So they were going door to door pounding on doors telling people there was fire coming. \n\nPeople don't just show up and pound on your door for no reason. \n\nI mean, black and white, no he shouldn't have let himself into the apartment.

He wasn't even the person to talk to the mother, right? So who knows what the story was that he heard. \n\nBut still- if he's sent there and he's banging on the door and no one is answering, I can understand why he might be afraid something bad had happened. What if y'all were tied up and being held hostage and he just knocked and walked away? I know that's a ridiculous stretch, but that's where your mind goes- either a gas leak and you're all passed out, or someone hurt you in the night, or something like that. \n\nShould he have handled it differently?

But yes, I really did feel like it was a complete overstepping of boundaries to let himself in, and to do so in such a disruptive way.

First off, the mother never asked for them to come inside, she asked them to knock on our front door. The manager did not ask the maintenance guy to come inside, she asked him to knock, which is what the mother asked for. And before opening their bedroom door to him, my roommates had asked multiple times who it was and gotten zero response. I\u2019m not a heavy sleeper and I have little to do with this scenario, but I was not fully awake when it was taking place because my sleep was very abruptly interrupted, so I was not in a fully conscious state of mind to think I should open the front door to him", "I have said this before but I\u2019m not fully conscious when I have just woken up.

I can\u2019t even say how long he was knocking because I really did fall back into sleep almost immediately after. I\u2019m sorry if you experience sleep differently than I do but I have to set multiple alarms before I can actually wake up, I can\u2019t be woken in a jarring way.

It\u2019s really uncomfortable. \n\nWe told management something was broken, and they said they\u2019d eventually come look at it and let us know when to expect maintenance. No one got back to us. Maintenance has a protocol to knock twice and ring the doorbell before entering. Dude didn\u2019t do that. I was in the shower, but I hear the doorbell over my shower no problem.

I work in a job where we perform wellness checks. 1. You should always have a witness with you. Going into a place alone could be dangerous for you physically and legally\u2014for multiple reasons. Just recording as you go may land you into even more hot water. 2. The maintenance man is not trained for this, by any stretch of the imagination. He also does not have the legal right to enter your domecile regardless if they have the keys or not. That violates tenant law.\n\nIn the real world please let emergency services handle a wellness check. If there is a mental instability you could be walking into something gruesome or life threatening and do not have the skills, training, or tools to deal with that. The police and EMS do.

Why did any of you even have to ask who was banging on their bedroom door? Why was he not clearly announcing who he was and why he was there?

It was fucking terrifying, and felt like such a deep violation. \n\nPlease talk to the building manager about this.

By noon, no one could reach him or his emergency contact. We asked the manager at his apartment to perform a welfare check. They found him dead from a heart attack, shower still running. If we hadn't, it could have been days before he was found. Maintenance guy had zero ill intentions and was clearly making sure everyone was okay and unhurt.

One of the mums called one of the boys but there was no answer.  She just assumed it was them not answering, so sent a text to check what train they were getting.  Teenage boys though, so they went to the railway station to collect them and they weren't there.  Waited for the next train, nothing.  At this point they started to worry, none of the parents were able to reach the boys on the phone so they decided to drive up there.  Knocking on the door, no response.  They eventually phoned the police, who arrived and broke into the apartment.  Two of the boys were dead, the other survived because he was in a different room.  If they had raised the alarm sooner the boys may have still been alive.  Of course it wasn't their fault, but the what ifs will haunt those parents for the rest of their lives.

The management sent an email (that's what I would do as well), but the mother rang again and possibly demanded that someone go to check what was happening. You do not know what your roommate mother told management and how she did it. Maybe she said she is extremely concerned as the daughter is not answering the phone, and it is so unlike her, especially since she has a flight to catch? Maybe she implied that something happened happened since there is no answer?

OP has said multiple times in the comments that neither the mom nor the landlord called any of the rest of them. So no, the mother did not 'literally contact them all several times.' OP has also said that her roommate's told her that her mom claims all she asked for was for someone to knock on the door to remind the daughter about the flight, not to go inside. I believe OP's take on the situation more than yours. Finally, he knocked loudly but according to OP didn't announce who he was or why he was checking. If someone started aggressively banging on my door, I wouldn't answer it, and I wouldn't say 'I'm okay,' because I'd have no reason to know that they were knocking to check if I was okay. I'd be freaked out that someone was trying to break down my door.\n\nFurthermore, like I said, someone not answering the door isn't grounds for a wellness check.
