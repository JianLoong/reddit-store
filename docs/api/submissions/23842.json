Let me explain why:\n\nMy fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents are divorced. My FIL is a weird guy who goes from \u201csuper good dad\u201d to \u201csuper terrible dad\u201d in a split second. He has not made any remarks about me or my family, so originally, I didn\u2019t care. He can be there if he wants to, and my MIL doesn\u2019t really care either (although we\u2019d have to get them seats that are far away from each other). He asked if he could bring his wife and we said yes. OTOH, I love my MIL. She\u2019s very kind and loving person. I definitely want her in my wedding.\n\nOn the wedding day (last week), everything went well. The religious ceremony went exactly like what I wanted it to be. It was perfect. Then, there came the reception, and this was when it got bad.\n\nI got changed into my reception dress. I loved the look, it was perfect. It showed a little bit of my back and cleavage. My husband was happy with the dress, because he said I looked stunning. \n\nWhen it was time for us to mingle with the guests*, my husband and I went to my FIL and his wife. His wife asked if I was not ashamed. I was confused about what she meant. She then made a joke about how I \u201chave no curves\u201d and \u201cshowing nothing\u201d. I got pretty offended, and I asked her what she meant. She replied: \u201cwell, at least if you want to show skin, you should show us something, not just a cutting board\u201d (it\u2019s a way of saying that I\u2019m flat). My FIL laughed at the joke and told my husband that he \u201cshouldn\u2019t be jealous if men look at my chest because I am basically showing them nothing\u201d. \n\nI got really pissed and didn\u2019t realize what I was doing. Well, I took my wine glass and threw all the contents on my FIL\u2019s head and dress. I told them to leave the reception ASAP. My FIL was pissed and told my husband to \u201ccontrol me, I\u2019m his wife\u201d, which he responded with, \u201cyou should\u2019ve controlled yours.\u201d\n\nThey left the building, and my husband received a long text message from my FIL about how he made a mistake by marrying a person like me who doesn\u2019t respect elders. His wife also posted a status on Facebook about how she was humiliated by me on my wedding. Now I\u2019m questioning if I went too far.
