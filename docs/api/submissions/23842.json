Let me explain why:\n\nMy fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents are divorced. My FIL is a weird guy who goes from \u201csuper good dad\u201d to \u201csuper terrible dad\u201d in a split second. He has not made any remarks about me or my family, so originally, I didn\u2019t care. He can be there if he wants to, and my MIL doesn\u2019t really care either (although we\u2019d have to get them seats that are far away from each other). He asked if he could bring his wife and we said yes. OTOH, I love my MIL. She\u2019s very kind and loving person. I definitely want her in my wedding.\n\nOn the wedding day (last week), everything went well. The religious ceremony went exactly like what I wanted it to be. It was perfect. Then, there came the reception, and this was when it got bad.\n\nI got changed into my reception dress. I loved the look, it was perfect. It showed a little bit of my back and cleavage. My husband was happy with the dress, because he said I looked stunning. \n\nWhen it was time for us to mingle with the guests*, my husband and I went to my FIL and his wife. His wife asked if I was not ashamed. I was confused about what she meant. She then made a joke about how I \u201chave no curves\u201d and \u201cshowing nothing\u201d. I got pretty offended, and I asked her what she meant. She replied: \u201cwell, at least if you want to show skin, you should show us something, not just a cutting board\u201d (it\u2019s a way of saying that I\u2019m flat). My FIL laughed at the joke and told my husband that he \u201cshouldn\u2019t be jealous if men look at my chest because I am basically showing them nothing\u201d. \n\nI got really pissed and didn\u2019t realize what I was doing. Well, I took my wine glass and threw all the contents on my FIL\u2019s head and dress. I told them to leave the reception ASAP. My FIL was pissed and told my husband to \u201ccontrol me, I\u2019m his wife\u201d, which he responded with, \u201cyou should\u2019ve controlled yours.\u201d\n\nThey left the building, and my husband received a long text message from my FIL about how he made a mistake by marrying a person like me who doesn\u2019t respect elders. His wife also posted a status on Facebook about how she was humiliated by me on my wedding. Now I\u2019m questioning if I went too far.

Also you married the right guy!", "NTA.", "ESH  \n\n\nShe and your FIL suck for talking to you this way, and at your own wedding, which is on a league of its own.  \nYou suck for reacting violently and dramatically, instead of asking them to leave the venue and go no contact.  \n\n\nThey are shitty people, you are violent and impulsive.", "NTA you are wonderful and so is your husband, I hope you have an awesome life together without your FIL in it.", "Lol, fuck those guys, nta. Your FIL and his wife are the worst.", "Sweetie, they were horrible words but just words. Throwing the wine and humiliating her was a nice touch but a better thing to have done is not show your cards that you bothered by it. \n\nRather for future events which I hope you will have many more, exclude your father in law and his wife. Put a ban on them. I\u2019m sure your husband will agree.  Exclude them. \n\nNow that you did the wine throwing, it\u2019s all good anyway since it\u2019s a dress and there are tons of dresses in the world and the humiliation on her part was temporary but hopefully longer. I hope you are not humiliated by her mean words and you love the way you look and most importantly your husband love the way you look. \n\nSometimes there is nothing you can do about nasty people. Just rid yourself from toxic people in your life. It will save your marriage and sanity", "Mmmmn yes, fabulous fabulous!", "Who in all of Hell would say anything nasty to the bride on her wedding day.  Who cares if someone is not as curvy as the next, I'll take my smallish chest over back problems any day.  Your FIL is awful, and his wife is worse, I would never talk to them again.  Your husband is awesome, so happy he stood up to them for you.  Pouring out wine may be a bit overboard, instead of just kicking them out, but what she said was so out there...I'm still mad for you.  NTA", "I... Think the wife was trying to make a joke? But it clearly landed wrong and got blown out.\n\nWine on them was a little much though.\n\nNTA", "For real. Compared to how many spineless wonder boyfriends, husband-to-be and husbands pop up on this thread good on this one.", "Right?! He\u2019s witty as hell. At least you married a dude who\u2019s awesome, in spite of his parents.", "Honestly, both of them sound awesome. I hope they continue to have each other\u2019s back and have many long and happy years filled with kindness and joy. \n\nWhen I read OP this immediately came to mind; https://imgur.com/a/7nYFYkF", "It is so odd how people think two wrongs make a right.\n\nSorry, OP, but YTA.", "The husband is terrible, what are you talking about? He did absolutely nothing to shut down his parents until it went way too far.", "Scottish?", "Hol up this is a murder scene", "https://imgur.com/a/7nYFYkF", "Particularly to her face. Like, of course there are some people who like to make unpleasant snippy comments, but most of them are at least sensible enough to keep it between them and the person next to them.\n\nInsulting the bride to her face at her wedding is just downright stupid on top of AH behaviour.", "I would file this under chaotic good. Hahaa", "i'd say she escaped before she got what she deserved.NTA", "Jesus turned water into wine. Who are we to say he didn\u2019t have a hand in this? I\u2019ve heard people say he has a sense of humor. It tracks.", "OP didn\u2019t go too far, she was the victim of a cruel attack for no reason, escalation was appropriate given the circumstances.", "I personally think if we all hoped she\u2019d do something like that and can appreciate the action itself, then by definition it\u2019s not too far. \n\nWhat they said to her was outrageous and deserving of at least that! In fact, I think it was a pretty classy and respectable reaction overall. And how her husband responded- \ud83d\udcafgreat way stp start a marriage with a partner who has your back.", "I agree. High road where possible. The MIL deserved it but there are other ways to respond", "I completely agree. As much as I love this, and as much as I live vicariously through this, personally I wouldn't want to fuel this drama in front of an audience.  \n\nNTA", "The bride salvaged the damage quite gracefully.", "It\u2019s wine dear, you aren\u2019t going to melt into the ether.", "Better idea to act like you accidentally spilled the wine \"oops I'm so clumsy\" and then kick them out.", "No, throwing just the wine was appropriate. Throwing the actual glass it was in would have been too much tho. \n\nI think it sets a good baseline for future familial boundaries. Ie., https://imgur.com/a/7nYFYkF", "Its just sad for the wine tbh, deserved for the FIL, sad for the wine", "Okayyy.. someone doesnt know how anger works.. doesnt matter but don't try to be a therapist if that is the case", "No contact is a great way to not have to deal with that. Sounds like the OP husband disowned \"dad\" after this. Final straw", "What? Assault and battery? It's wine, the police aren't going to take that seriously", "Right, seriously, why do people keep calling this a physical assault, it's wine, not the glass, the *contents* of the glass, not the glass itself", "If she is 100% justified then how is she the AH?", "Are you italian as well? Sounds familiar. \n\nHubby sounds amazing!!\n\nCongrats!", "People are going to be discussing this fabulous wedding for decades. New family members and friends will wish they had been there. This is the stuff of family legend.", "Still gives me bad vibes about husbands thinking they are allowed to control their wives, but not bad for in the moment.", "Bonus: I'm absolutely certain the loving MIL enjoyed the show! LoL", "What do you think she did wrong?", "Not sure he had the time to shut it down. Not sure he needed to either. The wife can handle herself. He just needed to support her. And I think he did it brilliantly.", "How did you guess \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I was just up half asleep lol", "You can never disguise it.", "There's been a murder lol \ud83e\udd23", "At least that's one silver lining, I've seen so many stories on here where the in-laws flip out and the husband either takes their side or just stands by not gettibg involved. Good job marrying a man with sense.", "Huzzah for the Hubster!\n\nYour stepMIL has a lot of nerve crying the humiliation card when trying to insult you on your freaking wedding day!", "This is a love story.", "NTA.  This will be a story told for decades, and it will get funnier every time it's told. Happy marriage to both of you!", "Omg, legendary.", "NTA on so many levels. 1) saying something snarky to the bride on her wedding day is just not done. 2) those sort of insults and what they are are insults is not done at any time. 3) was the wine red or white? 4) for them to say they were humiliated and you FIL saying to 'control' you. shows how completely clueless they are about good manners and what century they are in.  5) respect the elders, you did, you gave them a chance to walk out instead of having security remove them.", "Yeah, what else did FIL's wife expect to happen when you insult someone like that directly lol.", "You just reminded me of my moms old friend when I was in highschool. I have a lot of mental health issues and had a reaction to a medicine that caused me to balloon up and literally double my weight. So when they took me off of it I naturally lost said weight. This woman used to go off on me saying I looked like a piece of paper nobody would ever want me real men like meat etc and she would go until I was literally in tears. She went off on me so hard when we were celebrating me graduating I  cried in the bathroom of the restaurant for a good 20 minutes and then laughed at my face when I got back because it was red.", "No wasn\u2019t too far. Was the perfect response to the insults she received which were uncalled for. Insulting a bride on her wedding is trashy, she deserved to be trashed in return.", "Yup. It was her day. So she could have gone farther if she wanted", "at e=any time the comments would be cruel and rude and worthy of response. to do so on her wedding day? beyond the pale.", "She didn't cause physical harm to FIL or say something evil. FIL will survive having wine on him and at most it is just an object (suit) that might not have survived it.\n\nEverything claiming the high road acts like OP did something huge and bad or something. Please, it is just wine.", "But it can further escalate things and in some places even throwing liquids on people (even if it isn\u2019t as physical as a chair or fist) is assault. And those trashy people (the fil and his wife) are not worth it.", "No, but it could ruin the dress and carpet which is property damage, not to mention throwing stuff at people is assault.", "Yes, witches only melt when it\u2019s water.", "Unless she\u2019s the wicked witch\u2026which appears possible lol", "I had no idea a liquid beverage was considered the same thing as a solid fist. I must have missed that day in science class \ud83e\udd14", "If you cannot get angry without losing control of your actions, you need a psychiatrist. Badly.", "So much this, I would have been replaying the argument later and been like DAMN IT.", "I know man, that response was better than what I could come up with whilst reading the text, let alone in person.", "\ud83e\udd0c", "Dont think OP's husband was in support of the misogyny, just hitting the FIL with a comeback.", "OP's hubby doesn't, he was just using it to shame asshole FIL.", "Aparently she shoukd have accepted the feedback and shut her mouth. /s\n\nI like the wine throwing and the husbands response. Just what was needed in this situation. This rude woman will think again before she is rude.", "According to OP, the husband watched silently while:\n\n1. His mother said \u201care you not ashamed?\u201d\n\n2. His wife said \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n3. His mother made a joke about \u201cyou have no curves\u201d and \u201cshowing nothing.\u201d\n\n4. His wife got offended and asked again \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n5. His mother said \u201cwell at least if you want to show skin, you should show us something and not just a cutting board.\u201d\n\n6. His father laughed at the joke and said to the husband \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be jealous if men look at her chest because she is basically showing them nothing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s physically impossible for those six events to happen quickly enough for me to believe that the husband didn\u2019t have time to tell his parents \u201cstop\u201d or \u201cget out.\u201d\n\nAnd OP did not handle the situation as well as she wanted to; she surely does not want the only thing people to remember of her special day that the bride threw a glass of wine on her husband\u2019s mother.", "No one throws well crafted insults like the Scottish. Worked with a couple of guys from Scotland in my last job, one from Motherwell the other from Paisley. The big give away was \"ya prune\" and \"scrotum\".", "Dang. I'm so sorry, that is way messed up. I would not let that fly happening to my kid", "It\u2019s crazy how some grown women are jealous of teenagers", "Really a failure on the bridal party to not have more glasses of wine available at a moments notice for such a reason!", "Yeah, it was an unprompted uncalled for vicious attack any day, but you especially don\u2019t attack someone like that on their day. There\u2019s very little she could have done that would have been taking it too far.", "oh so that's what people mean when they say red wedding", "You do realise assault doesn\u2019t have only one level of severity?", "Not sure she has that kind of self awareness but we can hope \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Lol one of them was born in same town as me small world", "Carafes ate the truly appropriate response", "I\u2019m expecting a fireman\u2019s line of wineglasses for the bride to throw at this horrible woman lol", "I\u2019m literally talking about the fact that they said punches. Yes throwing a drink is considered assault, but it is not considered a punch.", "Wine? Punch? It\u2019s all drink. ;)\n\nNah, JK, I misread the one you were replying to, so my bad.", "All good. To be fair they did have an opportunity to turn that into a pub with the punches comment but I really don\u2019t think that was their intention."]}
