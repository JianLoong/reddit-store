{"id": 21164, "submission_id": "14oxwis", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for my daughter's wedding because she won't let me walk her down the aisle?", "selftext": "I'm a 48-year-old man and my 19-year-old daughter has always been an independent thinker. I raised her to be independent and think for herself, which I've always appreciated. However, we recently hit a bit of a snag.\n\nShe got engaged and decided that she doesn't want me to walk her down the aisle at her wedding. She argues that her mother and I don't \"own\" her, therefore we have no right to \"give her away\". I feel hurt by this because we never treated her like an object or piece of property, rather we've tried our best to provide her with a wonderful life.\n\nHer stance seems extreme to me and despite discussions, she's refusing to budge on the issue. I respect her choices, but I feel she's disregarding our feelings completely. As a response, I told her that if she feels that way, then I won't be paying for her wedding.\n\nI don't want to come across as controlling or manipulative. But by her logic, if I don't \"own\" her, I also don't owe her a fully-funded wedding. She can pay for her own wedding if she's insistent on this stance.\n\nI'm feeling quite conflicted about this. AITA?\n\nEdit:So, this isn't about making the wedding about me. Walking her down the aisle (while all eyes are on her anyway) and then sitting down is hardly making the wedding about me. It's about her attitude. She's had every opportunity in life so far, and to exclude us from this day is a spit in the face. It's a rejection of everything we've done for her, sacrificed for her, given her. It's selfish.  \n\n\n\"90% of wedding traditions and symbolism had roots in things we don't acknowledge today. Should we stop all of them? The rings, the flowers, the dress, the wedding party, the cake, the flower girls... a father walking his daughter down the aisle has been about respect, pride, love and honoring the father/daughter relationship for far longer than it was about ownership.\"\n\nIndependent thinking does not mean rude or selfish thinking. Being an independent thinker does not give someone the license to disregard or disrespect the thoughts, feelings, or perspectives of others. Independent thinking is about maintaining the ability to think critically and form one's own opinions while remaining respectful and considerate of others. It is a balance between asserting individuality and engaging in meaningful and respectful interactions with others.", "created_utc": 1688328674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14oxwis/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_daughters_wedding/", "score": 804, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is independent.\n\nIndependent people deal with their own bills", "Did she ask for you to pay for her wedding?", "NTA exactly because it's your money, your call. But die on this hill, daughter funds her own wedding, be prepared to not even get an invite, much less walk her down the aisle. It'll be her money, her call.", "I can understand why your feelings are hurt. However, were you planning on paying for the wedding as a gift to your child to celebrate their marriage, or because you would get to symbolically give your child away to a spouse? Were you only going to fund the wedding because \u201cyou own your child\u201d therefore if you don\u2019t own your child, you don\u2019t owe paying for a wedding, per your attempt at throwing in your child\u2019s face their stated reason for not wanting to be given away?\n\nYour child isn\u2019t saying that you treated your children like property, but they probably see the symbolism and where this tradition stems from and don\u2019t wish to participate. Try to respect your child\u2019s independent thinking and point of view, and you shouldn\u2019t expect your children to always compromise their principles because of your feelings. It would be fine to talk with them and share how you feel, but YTA for taking your feelings as a reason to not support your child.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t think people should expect that weddings are paid for by parents, but if there was a reasonable expectation because you funded a sibling wedding, it\u2019s not fair for the gift to be contingent on this one thing that is clearly important to your independent thinker. Maybe you can talk about other ways you can be involved in the wedding, especially as tradition doesn\u2019t seem to be that important to your child. Always choose listening and talking it out over threats and ultimatums (and it doesn\u2019t count as \u201ctalking it out\u201d if the parties are only talking to convince, not listening and trying to understand the other\u2019s point of view).", "YTA she's not rejecting you she's rejecting a patriarchal tradition. \n\n19 is far too young to be getting married.

Slightly different from your daughter due to having lived on my own for a few years by then but I understand her thinking. It\u2019s not about \u201cownership\u201d. The tradition boils down to being handed over from one man to the other. Obviously people will wrap it up in whatever loving tradition blah blah blah but that\u2019s literally what is happening in that tradition. Is she completely cutting you out? Will there be a father/daughter dance? Will you be included in pictures? Unless she\u2019s not doing anything with you, you are being controlling by threatening finances.

Stop making this about you. \n\nYou are not obligated to pay for her wedding anymore than she\u2019s obligated to let you walk her down the aisle.

Also, your daughter is correct in reasons for not wanting to adhere to a tradition that is essentially ownership transfer. \nThere's got to be a way you can express your feeling and respect hers too. Maybe both you and her mom walk her down the aisle and when the question is asked she can say, \"I do, with the support of my family.\" Get creative. Your relationship with your daughter is the most important thing at the end of the day, so take it on yourself to still be the \"parent\" of this situation.", "YTA this tradition of the father \"giving away the bride\" literally comes from how they used to literally sell women as if they were property.

But hey, I'll say YTA but I know that you don't have to pay for her wedding, and she doesn't have to care about you or invite you to anything or visit ever again because you're borderline trying to manipulate her into giving in by withholding. I'm not sure if you made agreements or not about paying for the wedding, but I'm sure you can swing it. You're just being an idiot and alienating your family.\nEdit: It's literally nothing to do with how independent she may or may not be and everything to do with her simply not wanting to act out an archaic tradition where women would be sold as if they were property, give her a break.", "NAH \n\nI get both points of view. I dont want my dad to \"give me away\" when I get married but I also am expecting 0 financial support from my parents. Its becoming more normalized that women walk themselves down the isle.

Talk about it in a \u201cwalking you through life, then walking you to your husband\u201d or just about a show of support and how you\u2019ll always be there for her.

You don't have to pay for her wedding, but the fact that you were perfectly willing to until you didn't get your ego trip walk down the asile is what makes you the AH.\n\nIt IS a sexist tradition that she feels strongly about, and you don't respect that. You just dismiss it b/c of your... pride?\n\nIf you had a son, would you demand you walk him down the asile? No?

You don't 'owe' her a fully paid wedding (or any contribution), but pulling your funds because her idea for the wedding is not the same as yours is shitty. Especially if you promised to pay, and they've planned accordingly. Do you really want to push this, and feel like you 'bought' your right to give her away? Your relationship will most likely never recover from this.\n\nAlso, look at it this way: giving your daughter away implies she's no longer part of your family.

I heard a great phrase \"traditions are just peer pressure from dead people\". She's right, and there are a surprising amount of traditions involved in weddings that do come from when women were viewed as property.\n\nDid she know your money had strings attached re certain traditions when you first agreed to pay for the wedding? Or is this something you're just springing on her now?\n\nThink very hard about what your next move is going to be. Sure, you could take the money away, but they could also go NC. What's more important to you: going through with a tradition your daughter doesn't agree with, or a relationship with your daughter?", "Ehhhh.....\n\nBy tradition, a father \"giving away\" his daughter was a symbol of her becoming property of her husband. \n\nIts your call on where you spend your money. Its her call on not continuing this tradition.\n\nPersonally, I didnt want this, my grandparents insisted, so my partner and I decided to do our own wedding and didnt invite any of our family since they all had a demand, expectation, or problem with damn near everything we wanted from the venue (not in a church) to the ceremony (I did not want \"given away\"), to the guest list (you NEED to invite this person who makes every evebt about them and is not above stealing because they think its funny). \n\nAre you ok with possibly being outted altogether because of one, very outdated, tradition?", "YTA. You were not under obligation to pay for your children\u2019s weddings but now that you\u2019ve agreed to it on a condition, the condition itself must come under scrutiny. \n\nYour condition makes you the AH because you\u2019re making this about your feelings when it needs to be about hers\u2014it is her wedding and it is about her and how she feels she is being perceived. Whether you like it or not, the tradition of walking a daughter down the aisle has its origins in ownership, and she has chosen for herself how to feel about it. That is critical thinking, that is independence.", "NTA but think long and hard about putting conditions on her wedding. This is a situation where you can win the battle (not paying for the wedding) and lose the war (your daughter). \n\nWhich is more important to you: attending the wedding but not walking her down the aisle or not being invited at all?\n\nUltimately it's about control on both sides. She accepts your money on the condition you walk her down the aisle. She pays for her own wedding, she controls the guest list.", "YTA - the tradition of giving someone away is literally saying you own your daughter if you think about it for 1 second.  Most people don't give a shit about this and just think it's a cute tradition and that's fine, I honestly probably would have my dad walk me down the isle because I'm just not that deep.  But clearly it DOES mean something to your daughter and it means something really bad.  Why would you even WANT to walk her down the isle if you knew the whole time she is thinking that it is symbolic of you owning her and giving her away to her husband who now gets to own her?", "YTA.  Why are you making her wedding about you?  \n\nShe should hit the court house and flip you the bird.\n\nYou\u2019re using $ to control. That\u2019s not great.", "Oof, what a conundrum. Damned if you do and damned if you don't.\n\nPersonally, I'd go one of two ways. Either:\n\n1. Tell her that if she doesn't want your full participation in the wedding that's okay but she won't het the full funding. Offer her fifty percent of the cost and let her and matey boy stump up the rest  OR\n2. Being as she's only nineteen and, I'm sure I'll get downvoted to buggery for saying this, the long term prospects for her and matey boy may not be particularly good, tell her you'll forego paying for this wedding but you'll pay for the next one she has when she's about thirty\n\nDon't envy you at all and also don't really know how to deliver a judgment.

Something that speaks not of \u2018giving away\u2019 but of pride and respect and love?\n\nI\u2019ve seen parents stand with the bride at the head of the aisle and then her walking alone symbolizing the three aspects of her life. Child of her parents, free choice making adult, to her new life with her partner.\n\nI\u2019ve seen both bride and groom walk the aisle separately each pausing to hug and kiss their parents before stepping before the officiant.", "I see it from both sides that the father of the bride paying for the wedding is also an outdated social construct but OP should want to pay for the wedding because he wants to not because he gets to give away his daughter like he owns her. \n\nBoth are traditions should be dropped if we\u2019re really talking about being modern and have gender equality.

Sure, this tradition originated from \u201cgiving the bride away\u201d, but nowadays it has nothing to do with that; it\u2019s a way for parents to be involved in the ceremony and be there for their child.

I feel hurt by this because we never treated her like an object or piece of property, rather we've tried our best to provide her with a wonderful life.\r  \n\r  \nHer stance seems extreme to me and despite discussions, she's refusing to budge on the issue.

As a response, I told her that if she feels that way, then I won't be paying for her wedding.\r  \n\r  \nI don't want to come across as controlling or manipulative. But by her logic, if I don't \"own\" her, I also don't owe her a fully-funded wedding.

If the actual specific walk is a problem why not have her walk alone and then have the parents walk down together arm in arm?  Why not have mom and dad walk first and then turn and invite the bride.  This is really an opportunity to do something awesome.  What is happening is each person is applying their own logic to the other person\u2019s request and dismissing it as ridiculous and petty.  That\u2019s an option and we can go the nuclear arms race route and respond tit for tat.  Or we can de-construct the issue and come up with something that allows the parents to be included and the daughter to feel independent and in full control of her wedding.  I\u2019m a Dad and I think the walk down the aisle is dumb because why wouldn\u2019t mom always be there too and why can\u2019t the parents just be standing up front and all eyes on the bride but honestly if my daughter tried to exclude me from something it would smart a little.
