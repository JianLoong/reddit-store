{"id": 21164, "submission_id": "14oxwis", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for my daughter's wedding because she won't let me walk her down the aisle?", "selftext": "I'm a 48-year-old man and my 19-year-old daughter has always been an independent thinker. I raised her to be independent and think for herself, which I've always appreciated. However, we recently hit a bit of a snag.\n\nShe got engaged and decided that she doesn't want me to walk her down the aisle at her wedding. She argues that her mother and I don't \"own\" her, therefore we have no right to \"give her away\". I feel hurt by this because we never treated her like an object or piece of property, rather we've tried our best to provide her with a wonderful life.\n\nHer stance seems extreme to me and despite discussions, she's refusing to budge on the issue. I respect her choices, but I feel she's disregarding our feelings completely. As a response, I told her that if she feels that way, then I won't be paying for her wedding.\n\nI don't want to come across as controlling or manipulative. But by her logic, if I don't \"own\" her, I also don't owe her a fully-funded wedding. She can pay for her own wedding if she's insistent on this stance.\n\nI'm feeling quite conflicted about this. AITA?\n\nEdit: So, this isn't about making the wedding about me. Walking her down the aisle (while all eyes are on her anyway) and then sitting down is hardly making the wedding about me. It's about her attitude. She's had every opportunity in life so far, and to exclude us from this day is a spit in the face. It's a rejection of everything we've done for her, sacrificed for her, given her. It's selfish.\n\n\"90% of wedding traditions and symbolism had roots in things we don't acknowledge today. Should we stop all of them? The rings, the flowers, the dress, the wedding party, the cake, the flower girls... a father walking his daughter down the aisle has been about respect, pride, love and honoring the father/daughter relationship for far longer than it was about ownership.\"\n\nIndependent thinking does not mean rude or selfish thinking. Being an independent thinker does not give someone the license to disregard or disrespect the thoughts, feelings, or perspectives of others. Independent thinking is about maintaining the ability to think critically and form one's own opinions while remaining respectful and considerate of others. It is a balance between asserting individuality and engaging in meaningful and respectful interactions with others.  \n\n\nEdit 2: Also note that our relationship is not so weak that this disagreement will \"ruin our relationship.\" We are still close with each other in spite of this. There is zero chance of her not inviting us to her wedding (regardless of who pays for it) or cutting off contact and withholding grandchildren. I feel sorry for anyone who suggests that as a possibility. In life, people disagree - even strongly - it's a natural part of life. We don't end life-long relationships over it.", "created_utc": 1688328674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14oxwis/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_daughters_wedding/", "score": 8530, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe they really will be together forever, but if they truly believe that they can grow up together a little bit before making that big of a commitment.\n\nETA: NTA\n\nEdit2: y\u2019all I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible for things to work out for 19 year olds getting married. You don\u2019t have to keep using your grandma as an example. I have also been with my husband since we were 19/20 but waited until we were 25/26 to get married as we both knew enough to know we weren\u2019t ready for the commitment & sacrifice that comes with marriage at a young age. This 19 year old does not appear to display the maturity to make a lifelong commitment. She wants to get rid of the tradition of having her dad give her away but not her parents \u201cdowry\u201d of paying for a wedding. I\u2019m all for being independent & wanting to move away from traditional practices if they don\u2019t align with your beliefs, but you don\u2019t then get to cherry pick only the practices that benefit you. I stand by my original comment.", "NTA\n\nYou heard her. She is independent.\n\nIndependent people deal with their own bills", "Did she ask for you to pay for her wedding?", "NTA exactly because it's your money, your call. But die on this hill, daughter funds her own wedding, be prepared to not even get an invite, much less walk her down the aisle. It'll be her money, her call.", "I can understand why your feelings are hurt. However, were you planning on paying for the wedding as a gift to your child to celebrate their marriage, or because you would get to symbolically give your child away to a spouse? Were you only going to fund the wedding because \u201cyou own your child\u201d therefore if you don\u2019t own your child, you don\u2019t owe paying for a wedding, per your attempt at throwing in your child\u2019s face their stated reason for not wanting to be given away?\n\nYour child isn\u2019t saying that you treated your children like property, but they probably see the symbolism and where this tradition stems from and don\u2019t wish to participate. Try to respect your child\u2019s independent thinking and point of view, and you shouldn\u2019t expect your children to always compromise their principles because of your feelings. It would be fine to talk with them and share how you feel, but YTA for taking your feelings as a reason to not support your child.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t think people should expect that weddings are paid for by parents, but if there was a reasonable expectation because you funded a sibling wedding, it\u2019s not fair for the gift to be contingent on this one thing that is clearly important to your independent thinker. Maybe you can talk about other ways you can be involved in the wedding, especially as tradition doesn\u2019t seem to be that important to your child. Always choose listening and talking it out over threats and ultimatums (and it doesn\u2019t count as \u201ctalking it out\u201d if the parties are only talking to convince, not listening and trying to understand the other\u2019s point of view).", "YTA she's not rejecting you she's rejecting a patriarchal tradition. \n\n19 is far too young to be getting married. But thata not the question.", "YTA. I decided not to have my dad walk me down the aisle either. Slightly different from your daughter due to having lived on my own for a few years by then but I understand her thinking. It\u2019s not about \u201cownership\u201d. The tradition boils down to being handed over from one man to the other. Obviously people will wrap it up in whatever loving tradition blah blah blah but that\u2019s literally what is happening in that tradition. Is she completely cutting you out? Will there be a father/daughter dance? Will you be included in pictures? Unless she\u2019s not doing anything with you, you are being controlling by threatening finances. Do you really want to force your daughter to take part in something she doesn\u2019t want on a day that is supposed to be a celebration about two individuals committing themselves to each other?", "YTA. Stop making this about you. \n\nYou are not obligated to pay for her wedding anymore than she\u2019s obligated to let you walk her down the aisle. However you need to understand that a wedding is about what she and her future spouse want. You do not get a say unless they ask for your input, even when you have offered to pay. \n\nGet your head out of your ass before your daughter decides she is better off without you.", "YTA i see paying for the wedding like a gift and there should not be any strings attached especially from her parents. Seems like she wants to get married but without the old concept of \u201cthe family giving the daughter away\u201d tradition. Seems fair to me, I don\u2019t think she has anything against you, and you are proving that she\u2019s making the right decision by refusing", "YTA For having a hissy fit over walking her down the aisle. \n\nGo ahead and not pay if that is what you want. I'm NOT judging on payment. I am judging on you being pissy because your daughter understands the meaning of the father walking the bride. You don't own her, you don't need to give her away, grow up.", "YTA", "Did you previously tell her you would pay?", "ESH. Making an ultimatum like that YTA. Also, your daughter is correct in reasons for not wanting to adhere to a tradition that is essentially ownership transfer. \nThere's got to be a way you can express your feeling and respect hers too. Maybe both you and her mom walk her down the aisle and when the question is asked she can say, \"I do, with the support of my family.\" Get creative. Your relationship with your daughter is the most important thing at the end of the day, so take it on yourself to still be the \"parent\" of this situation.", "YTA this tradition of the father \"giving away the bride\" literally comes from how they used to literally sell women as if they were property. Her not wanting you to \"give her away\" is not about you, it's about her. But hey, I'll say YTA but I know that you don't have to pay for her wedding, and she doesn't have to care about you or invite you to anything or visit ever again because you're borderline trying to manipulate her into giving in by withholding. I'm not sure if you made agreements or not about paying for the wedding, but I'm sure you can swing it. You're just being an idiot and alienating your family.\nEdit: It's literally nothing to do with how independent she may or may not be and everything to do with her simply not wanting to act out an archaic tradition where women would be sold as if they were property, give her a break.", "NAH \n\nI get both points of view. I dont want my dad to \"give me away\" when I get married but I also am expecting 0 financial support from my parents. Its becoming more normalized that women walk themselves down the isle. But maybe a compromise can be made and both you and her mom can walk her so its more a show of support for the marriage than a handoff. Just an idea. But I dont believe you're obligated to pay for the wedding at all.", "YTA and you know it.", "Can\u2019t you walk her down the aisle without \u201cgiving her away\u201d why does it have to be all or nothing.", "I wouldn\u2019t pull this, because honestly it will make her feel manipulated into having you walk her down the isle and the meaning will be lost. \n\nI think the best way to go about this is to talk to her about how walking her down the isle is rooted in giving her away, but that is no longer the connotation it has for you. Talk about as a metaphor for walking her through life or just about a show of support and how you\u2019ll always be there for her. Help her reframe it!!", " YTA, she\u2019s right, she\u2019s not your possession to give away", "YTA. You don't have to pay for her wedding, but the fact that you were perfectly willing to until you didn't get your ego trip walk down the asile is what makes you the AH.\n\nIt IS a sexist tradition that she feels strongly about, and you don't respect that. You just dismiss it b/c of your... pride?\n\nIf you had a son, would you demand you walk him down the asile? No? So, what does that say about the tradition and about you? \n\nYour daughter isn't your prop and you don't get to treat her as such. Either you want to give her money for the wedding as a gift or you don't, there should be no strings attached.", "YTA\n\nA gift is a gift, and shouldn't come with strings attached. You don't 'owe' her a fully paid wedding (or any contribution), but pulling your funds because her idea for the wedding is not the same as yours is shitty. Especially if you promised to pay, and they've planned accordingly. Do you really want to push this, and feel like you 'bought' your right to give her away? Your relationship will most likely never recover from this.\n\nAlso, look at it this way: giving your daughter away implies she's no longer part of your family. I didn't have my parents give me away, because I didn't like the implication I was leaving!", "reddit is hilarious one day \"its her wedding shes allowed to do what she wants\" the next day  its \"its not your money to do what you want\"", "OP: I raised my daughter to be independent and think for herself\n\nAlso OP: I am not going to pay for the wedding unless she gives into my demands \n\nSo, which is it? Do you want your daughter to be independent or does she need to bend the knee? \n\nYou straight are acting out on emotions and a bruised ego. Keep it up and your daughter will probably just rescind your invite amd go NC, because she will never forget your hypocrisy and childish behavior.\n\nYTA", "You\u2019re really proud of your daughter. Are you sure you can\u2019t find a middle ground with her?

Or was there some other reason? Think about it and don\u2019t be petty.", "INFO: why is she getting married at 19?\n\nI think it\u2019s worth talking to her about wanting the tradition of walking down the aisle, maybe with her and her mum? Or would she be willing to have you walk her down the aisle but make sure that no one says about giving her away. \n\nBut really why is she getting married at 19?", "YTA\n\nSo, you brought her up to be an independent thinker... until those independent thoughts go against yours? I heard a great phrase \"traditions are just peer pressure from dead people\". She's right, and there are a surprising amount of traditions involved in weddings that do come from when women were viewed as property.\n\nDid she know your money had strings attached re certain traditions when you first agreed to pay for the wedding? Or is this something you're just springing on her now?\n\nThink very hard about what your next move is going to be. Sure, you could take the money away, but they could also go NC. What's more important to you: going through with a tradition your daughter doesn't agree with, or a relationship with your daughter?", "Ehhhh.....\n\nBy tradition, a father \"giving away\" his daughter was a symbol of her becoming property of her husband. \n\nIts your call on where you spend your money. Its her call on not continuing this tradition.\n\nPersonally, I didnt want this, my grandparents insisted, so my partner and I decided to do our own wedding and didnt invite any of our families since they all had a demand, expectation, or problem with damn near everything we wanted from the venue (not in a church) to the ceremony (I did not want \"given away\"), to the guest list (you NEED to invite this person who makes every event about them and is not above stealing because they think its funny). \n\nAre you ok with possibly being outted altogether because of one, very outdated, tradition?", "YTA. You were not under obligation to pay for your children\u2019s weddings but now that you\u2019ve agreed to it on a condition, the condition itself must come under scrutiny. \n\nYour condition makes you the AH because you\u2019re making this about your feelings when it needs to be about hers\u2014it is her wedding and it is about her and how she feels she is being perceived. Whether you like it or not, the tradition of walking a daughter down the aisle has its origins in ownership, and she has chosen for herself how to feel about it. That is critical thinking, that is independence.", "NTA but think long and hard about putting conditions on her wedding. This is a situation where you can win the battle (not paying for the wedding) and lose the war (your daughter). \n\nWhich is more important to you: attending the wedding but not walking her down the aisle or not being invited at all?\n\nUltimately it's about control on both sides. She accepts your money on the condition you walk her down the aisle. She pays for her own wedding, she controls the guest list.", "YTA - the tradition of giving someone away is literally saying you own your daughter if you think about it for 1 second.  Most people don't give a shit about this and just think it's a cute tradition and that's fine, I honestly probably would have my dad walk me down the isle because I'm just not that deep.  But clearly it DOES mean something to your daughter and it means something really bad.  Why would you even WANT to walk her down the isle if you knew the whole time she is thinking that it is symbolic of you owning her and giving her away to her husband who now gets to own her?", "YTA.  Why are you making her wedding about you?  \n\nShe should hit the court house and flip you the bird.\n\nYou\u2019re using $ to control. That\u2019s not great.", "Oof, what a conundrum. Damned if you do and damned if you don't.\n\nPersonally, I'd go one of two ways. Either:\n\n1. Tell her that if she doesn't want your full participation in the wedding that's okay but she won't het the full funding. Offer her fifty percent of the cost and let her and matey boy stump up the rest  OR\n2. Being as she's only nineteen and, I'm sure I'll get downvoted to buggery for saying this, the long term prospects for her and matey boy may not be particularly good, tell her you'll forego paying for this wedding but you'll pay for the next one she has when she's about thirty\n\nDon't envy you at all and also don't really know how to deliver a judgment. I'm going to sit on the fence and say NAH, even though if it were me and my daughter, I'd be just as thoroughly pissed off as you.", "Easiest YTA ever.

Have you considered how this feels from your daughter's perspective? It's funny that you say all of that stuff about what an independent thinker is and then proceed to do exactly what you're seemingly advocating against. You need to support your daughter in this or at least shut up and keep it to yourself. It's none of your business, it's not your choice, and to really drive it home: everything you've said makes you more of an asshole.\n\nEta: her not wanting you to walk her down the aisle is not her excluding you from the wedding holy shit", "YTA.\n\nWere you paying for her wedding because you own her or simply because you felt it was your responsibility to do so? Or because you love her and wanted her to have a beautiful day?\n\nYou raised an independent thinker but when that independent thinking is counter to you, you\u2019re going to punish her? \n\nDo you really want her wedding day to be a bad memory for both of you?\n\nHave you talked about compromise, creating something else symbolic or changing the symbolism of walking down the aisle to something different that suits you both? Something that speaks not of \u2018giving away\u2019 but of pride and respect and love?\n\nI\u2019ve seen parents stand with the bride at the head of the aisle and then her walking alone symbolizing the three aspects of her life. Child of her parents, free choice making adult, to her new life with her partner.\n\nI\u2019ve seen both bride and groom walk the aisle separately each pausing to hug and kiss their parents before stepping before the officiant.", "I see it from both sides that the father of the bride paying for the wedding is also an outdated social construct but OP should want to pay for the wedding because he wants to not because he gets to give away his daughter like he owns her. \n\nBoth are traditions should be dropped if we\u2019re really talking about being modern and have gender equality. But YTA for using it as a bargaining chip for getting her to let you walk her down the aisle.", "YTA. It's not being rude or selfish to not want to be treated like an object that's being passed on to someone else. You're implying that your feelings about the tradition are the only ones that matter.  I don't see anywhere in the post that she has been ungrateful or disrespectful. She just would like to skip this outdated and sexist act. Get over yourself. Don't pay for the wedding if you feel that strongly but don't get upset when it costs you your relationship with your daughter.", "YTA. Why do you think you are being excluded just because she wants to avoid traditions that don\u2019t feel right to her? Maybe talk and see if there is another way you can participate in the ceremony.

She needs to focus on her education and building a career first. \n\nThe women I know who married at that age were all divorced with little kids a few years later. And that made their lives so much harder. \n\nYou can contribute to the wedding she should be having in about 8-10 years.", "NTA. I think your stance is perfectly fair here. Sure, this tradition originated from \u201cgiving the bride away\u201d, but nowadays it has nothing to do with that; it\u2019s a way for parents to be involved in the ceremony and be there for their child.

Both my sister and SIL did the father giving away the bride at the wedding but I have told my dad since I was about 16 that there was absolutely no way he\u2019d be giving me away, as I am my own person who isn\u2019t a piece of property to be handed off.\n\nPlease realize this is not a personal attack on you, I love my dad and greatly respect him.

She argues that her mother and I don't \"own\" her, therefore we have no right to \"give her away\". I feel hurt by this because we never treated her like an object or piece of property, rather we've tried our best to provide her with a wonderful life.\r  \n\r  \nHer stance seems extreme to me and despite discussions, she's refusing to budge on the issue. I respect her choices, but I feel she's disregarding our feelings completely. As a response, I told her that if she feels that way, then I won't be paying for her wedding.\r  \n\r  \nI don't want to come across as controlling or manipulative. But by her logic, if I don't \"own\" her, I also don't owe her a fully-funded wedding.

If the actual specific walk is a problem why not have her walk alone and then have the parents walk down together arm in arm?  Why not have mom and dad walk first and then turn and invite the bride.  This is really an opportunity to do something awesome.  What is happening is each person is applying their own logic to the other person\u2019s request and dismissing it as ridiculous and petty.  That\u2019s an option and we can go the nuclear arms race route and respond tit for tat.  Or we can de-construct the issue and come up with something that allows the parents to be included and the daughter to feel independent and in full control of her wedding.  I\u2019m a Dad and I think the walk down the aisle is dumb because why wouldn\u2019t mom always be there too and why can\u2019t the parents just be standing up front and all eyes on the bride but honestly if my daughter tried to exclude me from something it would smart a little.

That\u2019s the amazing independent thinker in her. She knows what \u201cgiving her away\u201d is supposed to mean - that she is your property to be transferred to her spouse\u2019s property - and that doesn\u2019t mesh with independent thinking. It just doesn\u2019t. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you, someone who values independent thinking, talk to your daughter about coming up with something to compromise? Figure out what it is about walking her down the aisle that you really want, and do something to meet that need that both of you agree upon. Is it the recognition that you are her father? Is it \u201cyour moment in the spotlight too\u201d?  What is so darn important about walking her down the aisle that would lead to you going nuclear when you don\u2019t get to do it? \n\nYou complain that she won\u2019t budge, but what about you? If she is mature enough to get married she should be considered mature enough to have a say.

There's a lot of now crappy wedding traditions. We aren't doing a garter or bouquet toss. We're writing our own vows, nothing about obeying husband will be in them. There's probably more we are tossing or modifying once we come upon them.

Once he gets the car, it's his to do whatever, but if he doesn't agree to my preconditions to buying it, then no car. It doesn't matter that I could afford a million cars.

Especially when you know how strongly she feels about it, as you say it is her day, and also as you claim you love that she is an independent thinker. \n\nI think you\u2019re taking this very personally, and over reacting in a way that punishes your child. Her not wanting you to walk her down the isle isn\u2019t \u201crude\u201d \u201cselfish\u201d \u201cdisrespectful\u201d or \u201cdisregarding\u201d of your feelings because it\u2019s not about your feelings - it\u2019s about her beliefs. She is not doing this to insult you, she is doing this because she\u2019s not comfortable with it. You are not entitled to demand the child who you raised to be independent to bend to your wishes when it is against her beliefs, and you are undermining the values you profess to hold. \n\nIt also sounds like you set the expectation that you would pay having paid for the sister\u2019s wedding. Did you ever let her know that this gift was contingent upon you walking her down the isle? In which case it is not a gift but a transaction with the expectation of praise/adoration/a favour in return and you are not as generous as you think you are. \n\nThey are also very young and without your support probably unlikely to be able to afford a wedding themselves which you probably know already. Are you just revoking this payment until she is obliged to cave to your demand so that she can have the wedding in the first place? Could she afford this without your help? If not, YTA, because you are essentially banning the wedding by revoking the payment you long expected to provide. This revocation is a punishment for her refusing to compromise on her beliefs on her big day, all because your ego is bruised. \n\nTake a breath and realise this is not personal, and this is not an insult. You can say a speech, or do other traditions to be a part of her big day and celebrate her. You would not be the first parent who was disappointed about aspects of the child\u2019s wedding.", "Yta, because you\u2019re making her wedding about you. As parents we pay for our kids\u2019 weddings because we love them, not as part of a quid pro quo.", "Totally! I\u2019d also like add that the logical arguments don\u2019t really work here. The whole \u201cif I don\u2019t own her, she can pay herself\u201d attitude is quite exhausting. Every other tradition aside, OP\u2019s daughter has expressed that being walked down the aisle on her wedding day would make her feel a bit like property. She didn\u2019t say that OP is making her feel like property intentionally, just that she wants to abstain from that tradition because she doesn\u2019t like the way it makes her feel. Why can\u2019t we just listen to the feelings that she\u2019s expressing? It seems like OP is trying to tell her that her feelings are wrong. If OP was truly an independent thinker, maybe they would acknowledge and value someone\u2019s emotional experience as well as just a logical argument.", "Myself, husband nor my dad looked at it as giving away property. But I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with my dad. Him walking me down the aisle wasn\u2019t about \u201cgiving up ownership\u201d, it was a beautiful way to incorporate him into the celebration. \n\nHim and my husband played rock paper scissors to decide who was going to dance with me first. It was hilarious. I didn\u2019t care about the \u201ctradition\u201d of the aisle or who got the first dance.", "But that has nothing to do with what he's asking. I agree she's too young. WAY too young. And I don't think parents should be paying for weddings of their children, either. \n\nBut what makes him the asshole is him being manipulative with money. Pare it down and reserve your judgment on age. Dad is literally withholding money ONLY because his feelings are hurt because of a decision she made about it. \n\nThat's manipulative, and it makes him an AH. If he refused to pay for the other reasons - absolutely NTA. But the ONLY reason he won't is because she wants to nix a tradition she finds uncomfortable and it bruises his ego. That's fine that his feelings are hurt - feel that. But that doesn't mean it's MORALLY okay to withhold money he was OTHERWISE PAYING because of it. \n\nOur secondary opinions don't matter to the vote here.

Those kids were perfectly happy to return the candy to avoid being blackmailed. OP's kid isn't willing to be blackmailed, and if she's as smart as he says she'll handle having her monetary 'treat' removed just fine.", "The tradition really was sexist. The traditional part was bride's parents paid for the wedding as a part of the dowry/ bride price as the expense of taking her into their family. Then the father walks her down the aisle (or uncle/ brother/ responsible male family member) and the officiant asks, 'who gives this woman to be married to this man?' Then the father says, 'I do.' and passes her hand to the groom.\n\nThey literally handed off the financial responsibility of their daughter and sold her off. Like property. \"Peace out, she's your problem, now. Here's a party, some chickens and a woman. Bye!\"\n\nMy niece did want to have it included, and instead of giving her away, she walked up, was kissed on the cheek and she stepped up as dad took a seat.\n\nNo giving away. Just dad walking up with her.\n\nIn the past they would literally march women up and pass them off so they didn't run and it was a financial transaction.

I've never heard anyone regret having their dad walk them down the aisle but I have heard plenty of regrets of not having dad walk with them. I'm sure there's someone out there that had a flaking out or had been pressured to do it and then regret it. But it's not the typical.  \n\nMy dad passed a couple years ago, and some of my fondest memories with him are from my wedding dad.

I think it can depend on your religious background too. There are Christian Bible verses about leaving your mother and father and clinging to your spouse so in that sense your parents are giving you to a spouse not as property but as in the spouse is now the most important relationship and you honor and respect them above your parents. So there are definitely different ways to look at it but I think a compromise could be found if daughter was willing to look at it from other perspectives.", "Imo it\u2019s more a gift for a gift, or no one gets one. You give me the gift of walking you down the aisle and creating the memory and I gift you money for a wedding or we neither get a gift and I just sit with everyone else.

The only rules (one side of the story) was that she call if she was not coming home, if she was going to be out late to text or call and that she save her money to build a cushion. She wanted her life, her rules. That is fair. But from what I have seen she is not the most responsible. We grew up poor and have worked since we were sixteen.
