A few years ago she decided to go off and do drugs. her kids at the time were around 5, 3 and 2 months old. The 5 and 3 year old went with their dad. I was 21 with a 2 year old myself, working full time and trying to finish my associates degree. I kept him for a week and she had a dirty drug test while I had him and I decided I wouldn\u2019t keep him.. it was just too much. I was expected to make my life 10x harder so she could just go off and party and do drugs. He unfortunately went to a foster home, BUT she got her shit together and got him back in less than 1 year. At the time I was so mad at her, but our relationship got better through the next few years and she told me it was better for me not to take him because she doesn\u2019t think she wouldn\u2019t of gotten her shit together so fast if she knew he was safe with me. \n\nFast forward to now, she had 2 more kids - so 5 total and has decided to do drugs again. Her 2 kids from the first dad went with him and the other 3 went to my sister who already has 4 kids herself.. the situation is terrible, it\u2019s been 6 months this time and she\u2019s only worse on drugs now that she\u2019s kid free. \n\nBut now on top of that, my sisters first baby daddy with her first 2 kids, just went to jail and my sister is expecting me to take them. I have 2 kids of my own, my car only has 3 seats so I couldn\u2019t even transport them. I work full time and I\u2019m also in school full time trying to finish my bachelors degree now\u2026 \n\nI don\u2019t have room in my house and I barely have extra money as it is & my sister is calling me selfish because I told her I don\u2019t have the mental, physically or monetary capacity to take in more kids right now\u2026 I had a baby when I was 19 and it made my life harder but I did and am doing what I have to do to give my kids a better life. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for her to get to go off and do drugs and party and just expect her everyone else to take on all of her kids full time.", "created_utc": 1691513499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lnlkb/aita_for_not_taking_care_of_my_sisters_kids/", "score": 314, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just like she told you the first time \"if you had been taking care of them, I wouldn't have gotten my sh!t together so quick because I know they would have been safe with you.\" This time because all her kids were safe with family, she didn't feel the need to get her act together, but now if you don't take two, she'll feel the need to \"get her sh!t together\" quicker. Just like before. She doesn't want to take care of her kids. That's on her. What happens to them because of her choices is also on her. You aren't at fault for any of that. You aren't in a place that you could take them in even if you wanted to.

FFS, after knowing how hard it was to grow up in foster care, with a mom like you all had and loser dads who don't step up, why would she do that to her own children?\n\nYou are NTA OP. This is not your mess to clean up and you should not spread yourself too thin for yourself and your own kids to take on hers.", "NTA.  Your sister's mess is not your fault, and her kids are not your responsibility.

She spent all $9,000 of her tax return in less than 3 weeks and this was after her kids were already all out of her care.", "Dear\u2026I am so sorry you are going through this.

But life is expensive & even if I had more money I do have a hard time keeping my head above water with everything I have on my plate right now. When I sent my nephew to a foster home the first time everyone in my family called me stuck up and selfish..", "Of course they did. But ALL of them calling you stuck up and selfish\u2026they could have stepped up to the plate and taken the nibblings in\u2026but none of them did!!! Think about that for a minute. They were ok bashing you but not stepping up for the same thing they were bashing you for!!! (Pot meet kettle!!!) However I strongly encourage you to hand over every single one of their phone numbers to the social worker and tell SW to call the entire family!!! You are doing an amazing job! You are working so hard to make your life better and the life of your kiddos!!! They should be proud of you for that.", "What is selfish is a mother doing drugs and losing her kids. Or a father getting himself locked up. \n\nAnd then expecting other people to step up.\n\nYou are NTA", "NTA - you aren't in a position to take care of her kids. Chances are by taking her kids, if you can't provide for all of them, there a chance CPS might end up taking them all away. Look out for yourself and your kids first.

You sister likes drugs more than she loves her kids. Since she's going to abandon them every couple of years, maybe it is better they get adopted by someone who actually wants to parent. The only selfish person here is your druggie sister. Do what you need to do, so the kids can be safe and secure.", "NTA you need to take care of yourself and your kids. Taking on 2 more kids is not reasonable.", "NTA OP's family comes first, I feel bad for the kids, but OP needs to take care of herself and her kids. Sorry, I feel people doing drugs and having kids should have their tubes tied. Not fair to the kids and those who have to take care of them. The sister is totally irresponsible, and it is apparent she will never change.", "Oh good grief, it\u2019s insane and clearly and addled brain that she is choosing drugs over her 5 children and then having the audacity to tell someone else that they are selfish for not taking her kids so she can keep doing drugs. Yikes.\n\nNo, you\u2019re not selfish. You **have** to prioritize your own children and education. It\u2019s very sad for her kids, but they need to go to foster care.\n\nNTA", "NTA. The selfish person is your sister for choosing drugs over her children. You can only do what you can do. You have two kids of your own. Congratulations on finishing Associates and working on your bachelors.", "Please don't believe you are selfish.  Your sister is the only selfish one in this whole story.  You are not responsible for her, her actions, her kids, or her kids lives (even if they were to turn out not great).  You can only be there to emotionally support her and the kids.  It is so unreasonable for her to put this on you--but it's the drugs.  She has chosen drugs over her kids.  Tell her that.  Tell her you are choosing your family.  She is choosing her drugs.  Come talk to you again when she is willing to chose her family.  NTA", "NTA.\n\nUnfortunately, you have to put your kids first. 2 kids having the upbringing they need is better than 4 not having anything, plus you having a mental breakdown in less than a year. Keep prioritizing your education. Perhaps when they are older you will have a better job and can support them in other ways. \n\nThey have resources and it's great of you to think of them this way. I am not sure how the foster system will work out. My brother and sister in law ended up adopting the 2 kids they fostered -- not without a fight -- but those girls have an amazing life now. \n\nAre you able to still be part of their life in some capacity?", "Seriously.

Your sister needs to take a page out of your book.\n\nThe very next time she tells you that you're selfish for not taking in her children, tell her she's selfish for not getting clean and staying clean for them. Remind her that while she's worried about what will happen to them at this very moment, it's not something she gets to cherry pick. If she loves her children and is worried about their well being, then she must be in a position to care for them without the need to party, do drugs, and add any other children to the number of kids she is struggling to raise.", "But non-innocent people can and will keep pushing out kids they can't care for. Her kids are no less innocent than any others in the foster system, and they would at least still have a mother with a track record of eventually getting over her problems who may come back for them.", "It\u2019s pretty rich of her to call you selfish when she\u2019s the one being selfish here.", "They are innocent. You can still be a part of their life without totally straining your's. \n\nIt really sucks all around but you are doing the right thing.", "Sad as it is, your kids come first and should ALWAYS come first.

My cousin just got a restraining order put on her by her kids father for being aggressive and destroying their home while on a drug binge. She is not allowed to be around the father or the kids and she has court ordered rehab or jail to look forward to. So far she has refused to do rehab and she is hiding from the cops. While still doing drugs all day every day. It is sad because the kids don't deserve what is happening and they deserve a good and stable home with their family. But not everyone is capable of providing a stable, safe and loving home. \n\nOur family is all waiting for the call that the police have found her dead, because she recently overdosed on fentanyl and they had to revive her. \n\nYou are not responsible for your sister, her choices, her kids or anything relating to her. She fucked up. She needs to fix it. You have your own family to worry about (your children)", "Uh no, not your kids and not your problem.  Your sister sounds like one of mine, zero responsibility and blames everyone but herself...  Stick to your guns and NTAH.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like right now you are barely holding on - so while yes the kids are innocent, that doesn\u2019t change that you do not have the ability to care for them.\n\nAnd the person who chooses to not get treatment for their addiction so they can parent is the person who is selfish.", "Wow. How sad. You are not your sister's keeper. NTA", "It's not your job to clean up behind your sister or correct her mistakes. He should have thought about what would happen to his children before going out and ruining his life", "It\u2019s completely stressful.

In an effort to take care of everyone, we end up not being helpful to anyone.", "Would more money make a difference? At least in my state, if you have custody of a child who is not yours, they automatically qualify for over $300 of cash assistance a month (over $400 for two siblings), free Medicaid, and WIC. Or, if CPS is involved, our county would train you to become a certified foster parent and you would be paid close to $800 a month each and get free daycare for them, plus still Medicaid and WIC.\n\nIf finances would make a difference, I would contact a social worker through your county's CPS to learn what your options are.", "Look, this isn't one of those situations where you totally could take a kid in and just refuse to.  You will be all but drowning based on your description.  It's terrible for the children and we won't pretend foster care will magically make things better.  But it doesn't at all sound like you are in a position to care for these children.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have capacity and that is ok.
