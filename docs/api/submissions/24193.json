A few years ago she decided to go off and do drugs. her kids at the time were around 5, 3 and 2 months old. The 5 and 3 year old went with their dad. I was 21 with a 2 year old myself, working full time and trying to finish my associates degree. I kept him for a week and she had a dirty drug test while I had him and I decided I wouldn\u2019t keep him.. it was just too much. I was expected to make my life 10x harder so she could just go off and party and do drugs. He unfortunately went to a foster home, BUT she got her shit together and got him back in less than 1 year. At the time I was so mad at her, but our relationship got better through the next few years and she told me it was better for me not to take him because she doesn\u2019t think she wouldn\u2019t of gotten her shit together so fast if she knew he was safe with me. \n\nFast forward to now, she had 2 more kids - so 5 total and has decided to do drugs again. Her 2 kids from the first dad went with him and the other 3 went to my sister who already has 4 kids herself.. the situation is terrible, it\u2019s been 6 months this time and she\u2019s only worse on drugs now that she\u2019s kid free. \n\nBut now on top of that, my sisters first baby daddy with her first 2 kids, just went to jail and my sister is expecting me to take them. I have 2 kids of my own, my car only has 3 seats so I couldn\u2019t even transport them. I work full time and I\u2019m also in school full time trying to finish my bachelors degree now\u2026 \n\nI don\u2019t have room in my house and I barely have extra money as it is & my sister is calling me selfish because I told her I don\u2019t have the mental, physically or monetary capacity to take in more kids right now\u2026 I had a baby when I was 19 and it made my life harder but I did and am doing what I have to do to give my kids a better life. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for her to get to go off and do drugs and party and just expect her everyone else to take on all of her kids full time.", "created_utc": 1691513499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lnlkb/aita_for_not_taking_care_of_my_sisters_kids/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds as though you are not in a position to care for her kids. It's completely reasonable for you to put your own children first.\n\nIt's very sad if the outcome of your sister and their fathers actions is that they have to go into Foster care, but it's not your fault or your responsibility.", "NTA, your sister decided drugs are more important to her than her kids. It's sad, but that's her choice and she has to live with the consequences. You can't set yourself on fire to keep her warm. Nobody forced her to have 5 kids she couldn't/wasn't willing to take proper care of. You have to take care of your own family, and your sister has no one to blame but herself.", "NTA its not your job to clean up behind your sister or fix her mistakes. She should have thought about what would happen to ehr kids before she went out and screwed up her life (AGAIN).", "Nooooo NTA. You have to take care of yourself before you can take care of others. You can't do it.", "Nta. Your responsibility is to your children first and then your siblings/nibblings. You don\u2019t have the ability to care for them. Your children shouldn\u2019t be worse off (having to quit school, not having proper food/clothing) because you had to take in children that aren\u2019t yours. And what does your other sister think you should do about the car situation? Is she going to buy you another vehicle? (Rhetorical question because we all know she isn\u2019t.)", "NTA. If you don't have the capacity, you don't. I get that addiction is a disease but actions still have consequences. It's unfortunate for her kids. I hope she recovers soon!", "NTA not your child not your responsibility. You would feel guilt and empathy as a parent and relative but thats the end of that.\n\nYou cant risk having less support for all your children and hers. You should focus on your own family and let her focus on her life. Help to call services for the children in her care if she doesnt though. The children can go to foster care, they dont deserve to be treated less than any kid.", "Your sister is doing this to her kids, not you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Not your child, not your responsibility. Even if you DID have the money/means to take care of 2 more, you still wouldn\u2019t be TA.\n\nYour sister needs to get fixed and stop popping out kids that she can\u2019t take care of.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re in a position to be able to take in the kids. Anyone who criticizes you can step up and care for them.", "NTA", "NTA \nSometimes we have to establish heathy boundaries for ourselves, including not over extending ourselves for family. It sucks for your sisters kids that they will likely end up in the foster system but hopefully your sister will get her act together and get clean. You have to take care of you first, and it is ok to establish a heathy boundary which says you won\u2019t take care of your sisters kids", "NTA", "NTA, you do what you can, and it is not your responsibility to make up for your sisters choices. She chose drugs, so she also chose the Foster system for her kids. Your sister should not be laying guilt on you for your choice, I have no idea how she can take those extra kids on!", "NTA you are Not her Personal Caretaker", "NTA\n\nYour sister has a drug addiction problem and has put her children in a terrible situation. You helped when and how you were able. You are not obligated to do anything more than you are capable of. This is her problem and responsibility. It\u2019s sad for everyone involved.", "NTA- They are not your children. Her children are going to be the ones to pay the price for her behavior, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to go into poverty to take care of them.", "NTA\n\n You have to think of your kids first.", "NTA\n\nYou cant save a family who is drowning when you are barely able to keep own your head (and that of your child)  above water.\n\n Trying to help them by taking them in will only pull you and your child under also and cause everyone to drown.", "NTA. These situations are so hard. My sister has similar problems and two young kids. I wanted to take them the last time they were removed but I just couldn't do it. My kid was almost out of high school and I didn't have space in my apartment for two little kids. Luckily their paternal grandparents were able to take them in so they didn't go to an unknown foster family, but it still broke my heart bc I care about them and I wanted to help but it just wasn't realistic. Hang in there OP.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a terrible parent who needs to get her shit together. End of story. Don't coddle her here or entertain her arguments.

Just like she told you the first time \"if you had been taking care of them, I wouldn't have gotten my sh!t together so quick because I know they would have been safe with you.\" This time because all her kids were safe with family, she didn't feel the need to get her act together, but now if you don't take two, she'll feel the need to \"get her sh!t together\" quicker. Just like before. She doesn't want to take care of her kids. That's on her. What happens to them because of her choices is also on her. You aren't at fault for any of that. You aren't in a place that you could take them in even if you wanted to. And it sounds like she'll just keep doing it as long as someone she trusts is willing to take care of her kids.", "Has your sister never heard of birth control? FFS, after knowing how hard it was to grow up in foster care, with a mom like you all had and loser dads who don't step up, why would she do that to her own children?\n\nYou are NTA OP. This is not your mess to clean up and you should not spread yourself too thin for yourself and your own kids to take on hers.", "NTA.  Your sister's mess is not your fault, and her kids are not your responsibility.    It is so awesome that you overcame your background and are putting yourself through college to give yourself and your kids a better life!  Not many people in your situation are able to do that, so you should be proud of yourself!", "I really do feel bad/selfish about not taking the kids, because they\u2019re innocent\u2026 but it\u2019s too much.", "Definitely not, my sister who already took her other 3 kids had to buy a mini van & asked my sister to pay for half when she got her tax return.. but of course she did not. She spent all $9,000 of her tax return in less than 3 weeks and this was after her kids were already all out of her care.", "Dear\u2026I am so sorry you are going through this. I can\u2019t imagine how horrible the whole situation is. I know if you could\u2026you would. But you can\u2019t.", "Thank you.. from the outside I guess it might look like I\u2019m doing better than I am, so she expects it. But life is expensive & even if I had more money I do have a hard time keeping my head above water with everything I have on my plate right now. When I sent my nephew to a foster home the first time everyone in my family called me stuck up and selfish..", "Of course they did. But ALL of them calling you stuck up and selfish\u2026they could have stepped up to the plate and taken the nibblings in\u2026but none of them did!!! Think about that for a minute. They were ok bashing you but not stepping up for the same thing they were bashing you for!!! (Pot meet kettle!!!) However I strongly encourage you to hand over every single one of their phone numbers to the social worker and tell SW to call the entire family!!! You are doing an amazing job! You are working so hard to make your life better and the life of your kiddos!!! They should be proud of you for that."]}
