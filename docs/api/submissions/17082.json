A twenty two year old does not have the life experience to recognize toxic traits and red flags that are present in a thirty year old who preys on much younger women, and present all over OP's post and comments.", "How? The same way older partners always take advantage of a younger partner's age - trying to mold them and keep them down, making them codependent. Using life experience as a reason to invalidate them. Using your own more developed understanding of yourself and relationships to manipulate someone who's still figuring it out.\n\nThat's not \"dragging her down a well,\" that's taking advantage of her naivety as a young adult. Which honestly it sounds like you're trying to do in this story.\n\nYou try to make her your servant, when she refuses, you insult her as a \"joke\" to express your displeasure in her actions (of standing up for herself), then belittle her feelings to make her think she's overreacting likely with the hope she won't do something like this again, and ONLY take her reaction and feelings seriously when your (presumably male and same age range as you) friends tell you you're wrong.\n\nWhy didn't you just apologize, tell her you were being an asshole, and try to make it up to her? I would guess either because you view her as not as \"wise\" as you due to the age difference, or because you don't take women seriously. Or both.\n\nMy boyfriend is 6 years older than me. We had a conversation when we learned the age difference about how to make sure we treated each other as equals. And I think any good age gap relationship (and mine isn't even that crazy considering we met when I was 24) does this. You did not, and that shows in how you're treating her.", "There's no requirement, but like with any differences in a relationship, it's important to establish early on how you're going to handle them to make sure both partners feel equal and listened to.\n\nIt's cute you assume I don't know what I'm talking about, when unlike OP, I'm in an age gap relationship where I feel like an equal, and we both listen to each other and don't need our friends and the Internet to tell us we're wrong before we believe our partner. And we had that conversation pretty much as soon as we learned about the age gap.", "Yep, that is exactly what they want you to think.", "The issue is not \u201chey can you pass the keys\u201d. It\u2019s your \u201cugh you\u2019re useless\u201d response to her saying \u201cI\u2019m busy doing something else\u201d. Is your skull really that thick?", "So if you feel you\u2019re in an imbalanced financial position, by earning less and paying more, why did you agree to it?", "I asked her to do something, she refused. I said something dumb but that I didn\u2019t mean. No, at the moment I didn\u2019t realize it was dumb. I ended up apologizing, she\u2019s fine with me. End of the story.", "I think he meant to say more, since he said yes to your question"]}
