I didn\u2019t say she can\u2019t drink or I won\u2019t allow it but rather that I feel uncomfortable encouraging her to do something against her religion.

It doesn't sound like anyone is being harmed by her decision to have a party and drink.\n\nIf you don't want to go, don't. That said, I don't think your reasoning makes sense. Few people interpret their religion 100% literally. It doesn't really affect you in any way.\n\nMuslims, just like any other religious group, aren't a monolith. I had quite a few Muslim friends in university. Some drank, some didn't. Some prayed regularly, some didn't. Some wore the hijab, some didn't.
