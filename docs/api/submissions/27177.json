They called him and asked him to come over. \n\nNow he's blowing up my phone and calling me cruel, and saying he's been busy with work that's why he hasn't returned the money. He's saying that I'm horrible for treating him like a thief and there's no way he wouldn't have returned my money.

Lesson learned - do not lend money and let him rant and rave - he is in the wrong not you.", "He blocked you. What the fuck were you supposed to do! NTA", "Nta but don't lend to him ever again", "NTA.  He's not a friend, he's a leech.", "NTA.\n\nHe IS a thief, and thieves generally don't like to be called what they are.\n\nHe can be as pissy as he wants; he could have avoided this all by  just paying back a friend - or former friend - who was kind enough to help him out.", "Meth", "INFO: OP, what country do you live in?\n\nSo there's a saying that if you loan someone $100 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it. I'm not saying everyone can afford to loan $100, but what I am saying is figure out what your number is so that you can be happy with and never loan anyone a cent above it.\n\nESH. If OP is from the USA, which I'm pretty sure OP is not, the proper method of collection would be to file a lawsuit in small claims court. In any case, whatever country OP is from, it's not cool to involve law enforcement for an unpaid debt. There's a reason debtors prisons are banned in the US constitution and that is because we believe it is a fundamental human right to not be jailed over debt.", "NTA He\u2019s not a friend and he never planned on repaying you. If I borrowed money from a friend I\u2019d literally run a marathon to get to them if I had to in order to return it ASAP.", "NTA. You are treating him like a thief because he is acting like one. He lied about bringing the money over that you lost faith. You had to resort to drastic measures. He wasn\u2019t too busy to come get it.  Give him a few days and if he does not get back to you tell him you will go back to the police", "Yep. Don't you just love those people who don't do something for days, weeks, months or even years and then - when they get called out on it or are forced to do it - they then complain and say \"I was going to do it!\". Please...", "But being blocked does not turn it into a police matter!  Take it to small claims court!  Pay $50 fill out a form and see them in court where a judge will force repayment\u2026 it just ain\u2019t a police matter!", "depends on the amount. if its a smaller amount, sure loss ledge and move on. but if its a sizeable amount, then there is no way that i am letting that amount go. if people's work, homes and lives can be impacted, then its their responsibility to make sure they return the money the borrowed from me or at least give me a valid reason to not force them to return the amount. in this case, the friend blocked OP's number and tried to cut contact.", "He's had a month to repay you.  He's made promises, and broken every one of them.  \n\nBut now... he says that he just hasn't had time and that he intended to pay you all along!  Nah.  The guy is a liar. He even blocked you to get you to stop asking.", "NTA. He F\u2014-ed around and found out. You didn\u2019t say he was a thief even though that\u2019s how he was acting.", "NTA. It\u2019s never a good idea to lend a friend money. And he should be treated like a thief because he is a thief", "NTA. He is a thief.", "NTA he wasn\u2019t going to pay you back for a while\u2026 and instead of being realistic and honest about how long he would need the money, he told you a lie to get you to give it to him. then blocked your number? he\u2019s the AH.", "INFO\n\nDid you get it back?", "Yes, you are. This is not a police matter; this is a matter between (former?) friends. If he doesn\u2019t pay you back or return your calls, then the worst that happens is you spent X dollars to find out that this guy\u2019s not a reliable character and not really your friend. In the long run, that\u2019s valuable information that you got for fairly cheap. But calling the cops is a peculiar move. He\u2019s the overall asshole for being a deadbeat flake, but you pulled an asshole move by getting the authorities involved.", "we don't really know which country the OP belongs to. but your solution to getting the money back is to throw more money at it. i am asking why should the OP have any such consideration. going to the police turned out to be super effective. sometimes just the most straightforward way is required.", "That\u2019s such a flawed take. By your logic, any loan between friends is something that can be taken advantage of because \u201cif you gave me that money, it means you are fine with never getting it back\u201d.", "You\u2019re right.  We don\u2019t know the country.  But most countries (certainly the four I\u2019ve lived in) have a way to file a complaint against another citizen who has wronged you and cost you money.  In most of the US it\u2019s $50 in other countries a little less.  It\u2019s not throwing money anywhere.  Should a judge or magistrate find in your favor you get that money back.\nCalling the police is inappropriate because they exist, in all countries, to enforce the law, not to act as muscle for private citizens.  If it worked out then that\u2019s great but that doesn\u2019t mean that its the right way to go.  The OP asked if he was the AH for calling the police.  I said yes because it\u2019s not a recognized way to recover a bad debt.  Back in the days when it was the way the prisons (specifically \u201cpoor houses\u201d or \u201cdebtors prisons\u201d) were full of ordinary people incarcerated by a disgruntled neighbor to whom they owed Pennie\u2019s.  It was a bad way to do things and personal debts are no longer a matter for the police with good reason.\nIf you don\u2019t agree with me that\u2019s fine.  No need to flog a dead horse over this."]}
