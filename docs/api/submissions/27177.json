For context, in my country we use cash for 90% of transactions. He said he was getting paid in 2 days, and he would return it then. Sure, he came to my place to get it. On the day he was supposed to come back with it, he said he finished work late. The next morning he said he left for work earlier than usual. It was reason after reason for about 3 days, then I stopped asking, trusting that he'd come with it. I didn't need it immediately. \n\nThe next week he stopped responding to my \"hi\" messages. Until I called then he said he'd come with the money later that day, he didn't show up. The next day I called again and he said he would send it to me, i preferred cash but I just told him to send. He didn't. When I called him to ask for help with something, my number had been blocked. This was 2 and a half weeks ago. \n\n3 days after, he texted me and told me he'd just gotten home from hospital, and he had the money on him. I told him to bring it home or send it over the phone, nothing until now. My calls are still blocked and he ignores my messages. So yesterday I went to the police station to ask if there was anything I could do, and they offered to help even though they don't deal with such issues. They called him and asked him to come over. \n\nNow he's blowing up my phone and calling me cruel, and saying he's been busy with work that's why he hasn't returned the money. He's saying that I'm horrible for treating him like a thief and there's no way he wouldn't have returned my money. A part of me feels really bad because we were so close before this, but at the same time I feel he was trying to take advantage of me. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1695107415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mk5dz/aita_for_going_to_the_police_when_a_friend_was/", "score": 314, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Once you borrow money and then proceed to stall and block the number of the person you borrowed money from, it becomes clear that you\u2019re not planning to pay anything back. I would have gone to the cops as well, NTA.", "NTA he's just upset that you called him out, and used to police to do so.

Your friend, on the other hand......", "No, but it\u2019s a hard and fast rule that you don\u2019t loan money if you aren\u2019t prepared to lose it. It\u2019s either the fact that you don\u2019t know your friend well enough, that\u2019s why they stole your money or you can\u2019t afford to loan money. Either way you are always a sucker for doing this, time to grow up."]}
