The difficulty of otnis irrellevent. Seems to me you are jealous of your roomie and feel the need to put her down in order to compensate for your own insecurities and inadequacies. Maybe you should find a real job so you can afford some therapy...or perhaps have a surgery to remove that chip off your shoulder", "YTA. Nobody has the right to tell someone their job isn't legitimate or meets your standards.", "YTA. What exactly was your objective in insulting your roommate other than being an asshole? It\u2019s not like your roommate was rubbing it in your face (at least from what I gather from your post) or complaining about her job or anything.", "YTA,\n\nMinimizing other people to help you feel better about yourself is bad karma.", "YTA she\u2019s getting paid for childcare which is a very real job.

If something happened to the kid during the time your roommate was with them (health emergency, etc), your roommate being there wouldn\u2019t be \u201cdoing nothing\u201d. You\u2019re right in that, most of the time, it sounds like an incredibly easy gig, but that\u2019s what makes it perfect for a college student who has her own learning and studying to do. (I know some college students who work nights as security for galleries or office buildings and they use their quiet night times to study- but they have to go on \u201cpatrol\u201d several times a night plus check out any security concerns. How is this any different?)\n\nThis is probably not a lifelong career- so seriously, why insult it like she\u2019s not doing anything valuable? Would you consider a fast food job a \u201creal\u201d job?\n\nAnd seriously, she is learning sign language to communicate with the kid better. Sign language is actually very different than our spoken language, plus it helps this kid feel less isolated and more understood. THIS IS NOT NOTHING.\n\nYTA.", "Yes. YTA, and you are obviously jealous. Lots of people in life will have better, easier, higher-paying jobs than you. That doesn\u2019t make the lazy or entitled. It makes them smart and sometimes lucky. \n\nCaring for a 12 year old while going to school is not \u201cnothing\u201d. Especially if they don\u2019t speak the same language.

It's not a requirement for jobs to be unfun and hard.", "YTA you sound jealous and unsupportive.", "YTA. Dunno how much your roommate's job will help their resume but still none of your business.", "YTA\n\nYou really think it's that easy to gain the trust of parents to watch their kid and have them allow you into their house?", "YTA and obviously jealous", "YTA and honestly I doubt you\u2019re going to have a roommate or a friend much longer.", "YTA. Does she get paid for her services? If yes, then it is by definition a job.

Every job is a real job (except for influencers)", "YTA, someone is trusting this person with the life of their child. It may not seem like that person is doing much however by just being present in the house should anything happen in or around the house those parents know their child will be safe and there is no price or payment that will ever cover the great fullness those parents have knowing that their baby is ok when they armt there. \n\nAlso learning how to communicate with the child and helping with school work? That's not as easy as it sounds, learning a new language at an older age is incredibly hard and doing that with no benefit to yourself is even harder!

If someone's willing to pay you for it, that's a job.", "YTA\n\nYou went out of your way to shit on someone.  Did you expect to win an award for person of the year?  Maybe you'll get an award for ahole of the year.", "YTA. She gets paid, so it IS a job. Instead of belittling her life, why don\u2019t you try to better your own.", "YTA. You sound like a salty, salty person. If you want that kind of job, go for it. No use acting like Oscar the Grouch and being cruel. Your roommate has a real job. She works, she gets paid. It\u2019s a job. You\u2019ve been rude.", "YTA. You\u2019re clearly just jealous and being a \u201cmust be nice\u201d kind of person.

And you sound like my ex boyfriend. \n\nHe barely graduated high school and works low wage manual labor jobs. Whenever we had an argument, his favorite thing to say was I had an \"easy job\" or not a \"real job.\" And a term that they used in Job Corp for people who work desk jobs... \"finger bangers.\" \n\nYou know what that is? Jealousy. If you think it is so \"easy\", you do it for a day and see how \"easy\" it is. I did it to my ex. One of the last things I did before I threw him out. I work from home and told him if it was so \"easy\" and \"lazy\" then sit down at my desk and do my job. He said that wasn't fair because he didn't know how. \n\nExactly. \n\nLooking after kids isn't \"easy.\" Especially kids who are differently abled.
