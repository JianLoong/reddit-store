{"id": 22774, "submission_id": "1554nlx", "title": "AITA for refusing to apologise to my boyfriend for an \"inappropriate\" comment", "selftext": "I (F23) and my boyfriend, Jake (M25), have known each other for 2 years and been together for 5 months.\n\nThe problem started two nights ago when we were together at my place watching Star Wars. Since we had both seen it before we were chatting and making jokes throughout. About halfway in, Jake made a comment about how pretty Padme was and how the silk nightdress was his favourite outfit. I also think Natalie Portman is pretty, so I agreed but said my favourite was the lakeside dress. In response to this, Jake gave me a weird look and pulled away. I thought it was odd but brushed it off. For the rest of the movie, Jake barely responded to any of my comments and pulled out his phone to scroll through twitter instead of watching.\n\nBy the time the movie was over, I was admittedly kind of annoyed so I asked him what was wrong. He ignored my question and started gathering his things. I followed him and asked again, as our plan had been  to sleep at mine and get breakfast in the morning before work. Once he'd gathered all his things he finally replied.\n\nBasically, Jake said that I had made him uncomfortable with my comment about Natalie Portman. He said it was gross and he didn't feel like I should be making \"sexual\" comments about other females. He said he didn't want to stay the night. Finally, he yelled at me, saying I should know why he's upset.\n\nI was absolutely baffled, and ended up just letting him leave. \n\nI am bisexual. My only other serious relationship was with another woman, let's call her Katie (24) during my first years of university. We broke up amicably about 2 months before the party where I met Jake as she moved back to her home country. Jake knows all this about me. We met at a Pride party, where I explicitly told him I was bisexual. During the months of texting it was mentioned and acknowledged by us both multiple times. On one of our first dates we talked about past relationships and I told him about Katie. Jake is straight, but he knew when we started dating and he told me it didn't matter to him and he was just happy to be together. \n\nThis is why I was so confused by his reaction. The next day we talked on the phone and I asked him to explain what was so wrong with what I'd said. He kept saying it was \"inappropriate\" and that I should know why he's upset. I started to get frustrated and asked him why I was in the wrong and yet he was fine when in essence we said the exact same thing, the only difference which dress we thought was better. I asked him if it was because I am attracted to women but he denied. I said I was sorry he was uncomfortable but I'm not going to apologise because I dont think I said anything wrong. He hung up on me and hasn't talked to me since. \n\nOur friend group are pretty split, with some saying I am TA and should just apologise and others saying I'm am not TA, he's acting weird and I didn't say anything wrong.

While it may be true that some people see making \"sexual\" comments about other people's attractiveness as a boundary, this man clearly doesn't because he thinks it's okay for him to look at other women and not for you to.\n\nSounds like he's biphobic. You know how some people think bis should just \"pick\" or that being in a committed relationship makes you straight or gay rather than bi? He's only okay with you having been bi before dating you, not continuing to be bi in any way thats visible to him.", "JAKE: *Says he is cool with dating and loving a bisexual woman*\n\nALSO JAKE: *Is not actually cool with dating and loving a bisexual woman*\n\nSorry OP, looks like you gotta drop Jake back in the pool and find someone who accepts your WHOLE self, including your past. And the lakeside dress.\n\nNTA and don't you dare apologize, you did nothing wrong!", "NTA. You have done nothing that requires an apology. This is a Jake problem.  Since when does saying some is pretty = sexually inappropriate comment. That\u2019s a stretch! Lots of girls, straight, bi, etc would say the same thing about Natalie. She is pretty.", "NTA. Im sorry but why the fuck are people saying you need to apologize for something that you BOTH did?", "NTA. So he can make the comment but you can\u2019t? \n\nGirl, run. This person is a giant red flag. Get ready for problems with your female AND male friends and a whole load of fights about bullshit.", "NTA\n\nHe can make a comment that you agree with and then use it as an excuse to act like a jerk? \n\nHe\u2019s the a hole. Clearly.", "Why are your friends saying you\u2019re an ah and should apologize? Wtf\u2026 break up with him.", "NTA. Do NOT apologize. Even if you were as straight as an arrow, you were making a comment about her dress, not the actress\u2019s body. Your boyfriend is obviously biphobic and needs to be kicked to the curb. And he YELLED at you saying you should know why he was upset. An actual adult would have said \u201cwell I felt uncomfortable when you, a woman, had an opinion about the garment another woman was wearing because I am very insecure that you will leave me for a woman\u201d. How were you supposed to know he was uncomfortable with you being bisexual? He\u2019s also the AH because you\u2019re right and the dress from the lake scene IS better. And those people who told you to apologize are not your friends. They\u2019re part of the problem.\n\nEDIT to add: He seems like the kind of person who doesn\u2019t believe in bisexuality and just thinks you haven\u2019t found the right man.", "NTA.\n\nIt's readily apparent that he has an issue with you being bi, despite his denials. When he had to deal with it as a matter of regular conversation during the movie, he wasn't able to handle it. He's now shown you that he isn't fully accepting of your sexuality, despite his claims otherwise.\n\nHe also obviously can't communicate his feelings. He blames you for not being able to read his mind--which is not conducive to healthy relationships--instead of using his words to communicate. Is that something you really want to deal with all the time?", "NTA He's a world-class hypocrite.", "I\u2019m NOT bisexual and I also think Natalie Portman is pretty.\n\nI also think that the hundreds of priceless artworks of women throughout history are beautiful.\n\nI guess your boyfriend couldn\u2019t handle me either.\n\nThe bottom line isn\u2019t that you had different views on what appropriate is, the problem is his lack of willingness to talk about it, and his position that his opinion is the only correct one, and that you should just know this.  There\u2019s no way to have a successful relationship with someone like this.\n\nNTA", "NTA it definitely his him viewing your comment differently because you are bi. My ex felt weird about me being bi until I sat him down and explained bisexual people are not just horny monsters and we can have friends or thoughts on both genders without it being inherently sexual. You partner def thought his comments were ok as straight man but took yours as being sexually charged because of your identity", "So he can comment on a good-looking woman, but you can't?\n\nNTA at all. And it sounds like he has given you a very clear view of how he will treat you when he's uncomfortable or upset, and it's not looking good. I'd reconsider this guy.", "NTA. So he\u2019s basically saying he was intending for his own comment to be sexual in nature about another woman, but became passive aggressive at his own projection of you doing the same thing. He seems like a misogynist as well. This is typically the guy I would avoid at all costs. Don\u2019t let his sexism creep in on you\u2026usually guys like that let this attitude extend to other \u201cwhat\u2019s fine for me is an offense for you\u201d things.", "NTA. It deeply annoys me the fact that you both said the exact same thing but with different opinions, and that it is okay for him to say but not for you. I think it may be a problem with his ego, or just plain stupidity but his argument is not even valid or logical. If Jake was definitely aware of your sexual orientation (even talking about past relationships), I don't think he was realizing what it really entailed. Your conversation was the eye-opening event that confronted him with reality. If he doesn't get a reality check or come to his senses real soon, there might not be a relationship left to save. I do hope, however, that it will not get all the way there.", "NTA if you're gonna date a man you gotta date one that will look at pretty girls with you, not get jealous over it (and of course vice-versa).", "NTA. It's weird that he's okay being at a Pride Party then he gets upset about your comment. Maybe he's insecure about him not being the only focus of your desires.", "NTA and I am baffled anybody in your friend group thinks you should apologize. He did the exact same thing you did.", "NTA. He's dangerously insecure.", "NTA\n\n25 and he's acting like this? \n\nHow does he feel when you make comments like this about male characters? As some others have said he just seems biphobic to me, specifically because he just made the same comment before you.\n\nHis uncomfortable feelings are something *he* should sort out himself since they seem to stem from either immaturity, unfamiliarity, or disgust. I hope for your sake it isn't disgust but unfortunately I have a feeling this is the most likely underlying feeling.", "Honestly it doesn't matter if you're straight, bi, gay, or a dino. Girls talk about fashion in films, it's specifically a thing to the point of that being *why* Padme wears so many different outfits! Lucas wanted to draw more female audience into Star Wars.\n\nApparently BF was okay with your past relationship because it was past and he was present--but apparently he isn't \"okay\" with you being bi at all, actually. He thought you *were* bi, and he's now realizing you *are* bi.\n\nNTA OP", "Boyfriend can state Natalie portman is pretty but you can't?\n\nSounds like he has issues luv, that's not normal.", "leave him now. i\u2019m willing to bet he spends time be sexual over girl on the internet", "ew I would dump the biphobe immediately. Your sexuality is only acceptable as a hypothetical while he's allowed to ogle over whoever he wants. Nasty, don't apologize for anything he doesn't deserve it NTA", "I still don't understand what you said wrong. He doesn't make sense. NTA", "Gross.  Always nice when the weirdos out themselves though, NTA.", "I'm a cis straight woman and I loved every outfit Natalie Portman wore in those films. WTF is wrong with this guy? It sounds like he's fooling himself into thinking you're not really bi because you're dating him. NTA and he's being a jerk.", "NTA He seems insecure, he can make those types of comments but you can\u2019t? That doesn\u2019t seem right", "Isn't it nice when insecure, toxic people who project their issued onto others identify themselves early on to make it easier to remove them form your life?", "NTA\n\nIf commenting on clothing is sexual and inappropriate, why the hell is HE doing it???????", "NTA\n\nBe glad this one showed you the red flag himself. Only HE IS ALLOWED TO FIND OTHER PEOPLE SEXY, OKAY", "NTA. \n\nAlso your boyfriend is queerphobic and this is the first warning sign. You should really break it off now before it gets worse. You deserve a partner who loves you for all that you are, including your bisexuality", "NTA I can't see why you should apologize.  He is just radiating insecurity, and may have a lot of prejudices he is not owning up to.", "NTA. \n\nI'm confused as to the boyfriends issue. I'm a straight female and I've often said \"(woman's name) is really pretty. I like the way she does her hair,\" or \"(Did you see (woman's name)? She is looking amazing! And the outfit - to die!\" \n\nAm I offensive to straight men for it?", "LOL, I'm straight (F) and I tell my partner how hot girls are all the time. He talks about hot guys. I currently have a crush on Rebecca Ferguson's muscle arms in Silo.\nYour bf is homophobic and a creep. You're NTA.", "Saddlebadge foreplay", "NTA but you should just apologise.\n\nIf I made a comment about a woman being attractive and it upset my wife, even if she initiated the conversation, I would just apologise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
