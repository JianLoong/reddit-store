Since we had both seen it before we were chatting and making jokes throughout. About halfway in, Jake made a comment about how pretty Padme was and how the silk nightdress was his favourite outfit. I also think Natalie Portman is pretty, so I agreed but said my favourite was the lakeside dress. In response to this, Jake gave me a weird look and pulled away. I thought it was odd but brushed it off. For the rest of the movie, Jake barely responded to any of my comments and pulled out his phone to scroll through twitter instead of watching.\n\nBy the time the movie was over, I was admittedly kind of annoyed so I asked him what was wrong. He ignored my question and started gathering his things. I followed him and asked again, as our plan had been  to sleep at mine and get breakfast in the morning before work. Once he'd gathered all his things he finally replied.\n\nBasically, Jake said that I had made him uncomfortable with my comment about Natalie Portman. He said it was gross and he didn't feel like I should be making \"sexual\" comments about other females. He said he didn't want to stay the night. Finally, he yelled at me, saying I should know why he's upset.\n\nI was absolutely baffled, and ended up just letting him leave. \n\nI am bisexual. My only other serious relationship was with another woman, let's call her Katie (24) during my first years of university. We broke up amicably about 2 months before the party where I met Jake as she moved back to her home country. Jake knows all this about me. We met at a Pride party, where I explicitly told him I was bisexual. During the months of texting it was mentioned and acknowledged by us both multiple times. On one of our first dates we talked about past relationships and I told him about Katie. Jake is straight, but he knew when we started dating and he told me it didn't matter to him and he was just happy to be together. \n\nThis is why I was so confused by his reaction. The next day we talked on the phone and I asked him to explain what was so wrong with what I'd said. He kept saying it was \"inappropriate\" and that I should know why he's upset. I started to get frustrated and asked him why I was in the wrong and yet he was fine when in essence we said the exact same thing, the only difference which dress we thought was better. I asked him if it was because I am attracted to women but he denied. I said I was sorry he was uncomfortable but I'm not going to apologise because I dont think I said anything wrong. He hung up on me and hasn't talked to me since. \n\nOur friend group are pretty split, with some saying I am TA and should just apologise and others saying I'm am not TA, he's acting weird and I didn't say anything wrong.

While it may be true that some people see making \"sexual\" comments about other people's attractiveness as a boundary, this man clearly doesn't because he thinks it's okay for him to look at other women and not for you to.\n\nSounds like he's biphobic. You know how some people think bis should just \"pick\" or that being in a committed relationship makes you straight or gay rather than bi? He's only okay with you having been bi before dating you, not continuing to be bi in any way thats visible to him.", "JAKE: *Says he is cool with dating and loving a bisexual woman*\n\nALSO JAKE: *Is not actually cool with dating and loving a bisexual woman*\n\nSorry OP, looks like you gotta drop Jake back in the pool and find someone who accepts your WHOLE self, including your past. And the lakeside dress.\n\nNTA and don't you dare apologize, you did nothing wrong!", "NTA. You have done nothing that requires an apology. This is a Jake problem.  Since when does saying some is pretty = sexually inappropriate comment. That\u2019s a stretch! Lots of girls, straight, bi, etc would say the same thing about Natalie. She is pretty.", "NTA. Im sorry but why the fuck are people saying you need to apologize for something that you BOTH did?", "NTA. So he can make the comment but you can\u2019t? \n\nGirl, run. This person is a giant red flag. Get ready for problems with your female AND male friends and a whole load of fights about bullshit.", "NTA\n\nHe can make a comment that you agree with and then use it as an excuse to act like a jerk? \n\nHe\u2019s the a hole. Clearly.", "Why are your friends saying you\u2019re an ah and should apologize? Wtf\u2026 break up with him.", "NTA. Do NOT apologize. Even if you were as straight as an arrow, you were making a comment about her dress, not the actress\u2019s body. Your boyfriend is obviously biphobic and needs to be kicked to the curb. And he YELLED at you saying you should know why he was upset. An actual adult would have said \u201cwell I felt uncomfortable when you, a woman, had an opinion about the garment another woman was wearing because I am very insecure that you will leave me for a woman\u201d. How were you supposed to know he was uncomfortable with you being bisexual? He\u2019s also the AH because you\u2019re right and the dress from the lake scene IS better. And those people who told you to apologize are not your friends. They\u2019re part of the problem.\n\nEDIT to add: He seems like the kind of person who doesn\u2019t believe in bisexuality and just thinks you haven\u2019t found the right man.", "NTA.\n\nIt's readily apparent that he has an issue with you being bi, despite his denials. When he had to deal with it as a matter of regular conversation during the movie, he wasn't able to handle it. He's now shown you that he isn't fully accepting of your sexuality, despite his claims otherwise.\n\nHe also obviously can't communicate his feelings. He blames you for not being able to read his mind--which is not conducive to healthy relationships--instead of using his words to communicate. Is that something you really want to deal with all the time?", "NTA He's a world-class hypocrite.", "I\u2019m NOT bisexual and I also think Natalie Portman is pretty.\n\nI also think that the hundreds of priceless artworks of women throughout history are beautiful.\n\nI guess your boyfriend couldn\u2019t handle me either.\n\nThe bottom line isn\u2019t that you had different views on what appropriate is, the problem is his lack of willingness to talk about it, and his position that his opinion is the only correct one, and that you should just know this.  There\u2019s no way to have a successful relationship with someone like this.\n\nNTA", "NTA it definitely his him viewing your comment differently because you are bi. My ex felt weird about me being bi until I sat him down and explained bisexual people are not just horny monsters and we can have friends or thoughts on both genders without it being inherently sexual. You partner def thought his comments were ok as straight man but took yours as being sexually charged because of your identity", "So he can comment on a good-looking woman, but you can't?\n\nNTA at all. And it sounds like he has given you a very clear view of how he will treat you when he's uncomfortable or upset, and it's not looking good. I'd reconsider this guy.", "NTA. So he\u2019s basically saying he was intending for his own comment to be sexual in nature about another woman, but became passive aggressive at his own projection of you doing the same thing. He seems like a misogynist as well. This is typically the guy I would avoid at all costs. Don\u2019t let his sexism creep in on you\u2026usually guys like that let this attitude extend to other \u201cwhat\u2019s fine for me is an offense for you\u201d things.", "NTA. It deeply annoys me the fact that you both said the exact same thing but with different opinions, and that it is okay for him to say but not for you. I think it may be a problem with his ego, or just plain stupidity but his argument is not even valid or logical. If Jake was definitely aware of your sexual orientation (even talking about past relationships), I don't think he was realizing what it really entailed. Your conversation was the eye-opening event that confronted him with reality. If he doesn't get a reality check or come to his senses real soon, there might not be a relationship left to save. I do hope, however, that it will not get all the way there.", "NTA if you're gonna date a man you gotta date one that will look at pretty girls with you, not get jealous over it (and of course vice-versa).", "NTA. It's weird that he's okay being at a Pride Party then he gets upset about your comment. Maybe he's insecure about him not being the only focus of your desires.", "NTA and I am baffled anybody in your friend group thinks you should apologize. He did the exact same thing you did.", "NTA. He's dangerously insecure.", "NTA\n\n25 and he's acting like this? \n\nHow does he feel when you make comments like this about male characters? As some others have said he just seems biphobic to me, specifically because he just made the same comment before you.\n\nHis uncomfortable feelings are something *he* should sort out himself since they seem to stem from either immaturity, unfamiliarity, or disgust. I hope for your sake it isn't disgust but unfortunately I have a feeling this is the most likely underlying feeling.", "Honestly it doesn't matter if you're straight, bi, gay, or a dino. Girls talk about fashion in films, it's specifically a thing to the point of that being *why* Padme wears so many different outfits! Lucas wanted to draw more female audience into Star Wars.\n\nApparently BF was okay with your past relationship because it was past and he was present--but apparently he isn't \"okay\" with you being bi at all, actually. He thought you *were* bi, and he's now realizing you *are* bi.\n\nNTA OP", "Boyfriend can state Natalie portman is pretty but you can't?\n\nSounds like he has issues luv, that's not normal.", "leave him now. i\u2019m willing to bet he spends time be sexual over girl on the internet", "ew I would dump the biphobe immediately. Your sexuality is only acceptable as a hypothetical while he's allowed to ogle over whoever he wants. Nasty, don't apologize for anything he doesn't deserve it NTA", "I still don't understand what you said wrong. He doesn't make sense. NTA", "Gross.  Always nice when the weirdos out themselves though, NTA.", "I'm a cis straight woman and I loved every outfit Natalie Portman wore in those films. WTF is wrong with this guy? It sounds like he's fooling himself into thinking you're not really bi because you're dating him. NTA and he's being a jerk.", "NTA He seems insecure, he can make those types of comments but you can\u2019t?

Only HE IS ALLOWED TO FIND OTHER PEOPLE SEXY, OKAY", "NTA. \n\nAlso your boyfriend is queerphobic and this is the first warning sign. You should really break it off now before it gets worse. You deserve a partner who loves you for all that you are, including your bisexuality", "NTA I can't see why you should apologize.  He is just radiating insecurity, and may have a lot of prejudices he is not owning up to.", "NTA. \n\nI'm confused as to the boyfriends issue. I'm a straight female and I've often said \"(woman's name) is really pretty. I like the way she does her hair,\" or \"(Did you see (woman's name)? She is looking amazing! And the outfit - to die!\" \n\nAm I offensive to straight men for it?", "LOL, I'm straight (F) and I tell my partner how hot girls are all the time. He talks about hot guys.

I\u2019m not looking to be sexually intimate with anyone but I would really like to know what standards I should be looking for in a potential life partner and this is the best shot I got.\n\nPlease help!!!!\n\nIf you do that the non creepy gentlemen will come out of the woodwork, if their old that\u2019s probably best and here\u2019s why. They have daughters your age and they won\u2019t wanna fuck you because they secretly hope that their lessons and teaching their daughters what good men are will be successful!\n\nJust something to mull over or if you have a good relationship with your dad, ask him to take you out on a daddy daughter date. Tell him you want to know how a boy SHOULD treat you. What he should do and ask him to do the whole thing from calling to ask you on a date and everything so you know how it should be done. Or if you have a friends dad who you\u2019re close with and do it with both mom and dad there. You win and also brownie points!!!!\n\nBut yes, please be so fucking mad about the hypocrisy of this and then be mad he was acting lasciviously over another woman and you were trying to be fucking cool. Fuck him and his stoopid misogynistic turd he rode in on.\n\nPlease go forth and enjoy tasting your goddamn rainbow and leave mr turdsly in his own bed to give the 5 finger salute to thoughts of Natalie Portman in a silk dress\u2026.there\u2019s so much out there for you to not let anyone treat you other than the goddess you truly are!!!!\n\nEdited for typo", "NTA. Yes, it is because you are bi. There was nothing sexual about that comment and honestly I've got more of an issue with his reaction that his dumb teenager brain. If I didn't know who's who, I would never guess a guy would be giving the silent treatment and acting like his partner can read his mind. You've got yourself a big drama queen.", "NTA.\n\nHis initial reaction shows that he's insecure with the fundamentals of who you are. His ongoing reaction and refusal to discuss it like a mature adult shows that he's not ready for an actual relationship and may also be moving towards being abusive. \n\nThankfully you've found out before investing too much time into this idiot.", "Okay, so first off, I don't think you're not the asshole.\n\nThat was such a tame thing to say too. He thinks it's inappropriate because it made him uncomfortable, which is the real issue. He's either uncomfortable with you being bisexual, or threatened by the mildest of innate attraction towards someone you likely never even meet. Maybe even both.\n\nIf he can do it, you can do it. The only thing inappropriate here is his reaction to all this.", "NTA.  Jake sounds very immature tbh.", "U basically said the exact same thing as him n sounds either jealous or insecure about it im not sure why he would get mad is he mad u didn\u2019t say that about another guy? Like i don\u2019t understand he said she was cute too", "Absolutely NTA. Even if you weren\u2019t upfront about being bi, why is it ok for him to make the comment but not you? Im also concerned that half of your friends are agreeing with him? Your boyfriend and apparently half your friends are seemingly biphobic. You deserve to be with someone that didn\u2019t treat you like that because of your sexuality.", "NTA, what the fuck is there to apologize for?????", "NTA tell this boy to put on his big boy pants and use his words to explain to you why he's mad. You're not a mind reader so unless he explains why he's mad you'll never know.", "Actions speak louder than words. He may have said he accepts you, but he clearly doesn't.", "Haha, NTA.

He's being ridiculous. First of all, indeed, you just said the exact same thing. Second, no matter their sexuality, people have eyes and can have opinions on who looks sexy on screen. \n\nYou come across as mature and secure in your emotional life and sexuality, while he's insecure and underdeveloped. He shouldn't blame you for his insecurities.", "NTA. Well the honeymoon is definitely over at five months in. All that \"you should know\" why he's acting like a small emotional bonfire is total BS - seems like you've got someone who loves a bit of mystery-drama too.", "NTA.

They must have been sexual since hen you agreed it was super sexual. \n\nThe arsehole is the guy dating a bisexual and then calling it gross\n\nThe arsehole is the guy who can't have a conversation about what's bothering him like a big boy.", "NTA\n\nBut wow, he sucks. Your friends that agree with him are weirdos. He most likely is biphobic. It makes him uncomfortable and upset for you to say an innocuous non-sexual comment complimenting another women just after he did the same thing? \n\nHe saw your comment as sexual cause he himself can't possibly think of complimenting a women without having some sexual implication, which is already weirdo and creep behaviour. But if he gets to do it freely but doesn't want you to do it he is clearly implying that your attraction to women it's wrong and must never be brought up. He downright said it's gross (but only when you do it, not when he does it)\n\nAnd even beyond his biphobia, he is a complete asshole for ignoring you and leaving your place for a simple comment, not being mature enough to talk the issue till you insisted and til he was ready to leave, yelling at you (dear god), pulling the completely psychotic \"you should know why I'm upset\" line, dragging the problem for more days and ghosting you.\n\nHe left your place angry, yelled at you and now he doesn't talk to you? That should be taken as him wanting to break with you, and honestly good riddance.

No one needs that in their life", "Bye Boi Bye. He\u2019s a nope.\nNTA", "NTA Jeez! Would he rather that you made a catty, jealous comment about her? Or get mad at him for commenting about her? \n\nI think that in the beginning, he could thought handle your sexuality. A few months in, he is rethinking that. That\u2019s my guess. \n\nYou\u2019ve nothing to apologize for. If you did apologize, would you even know why? HE doesn\u2019t even know why!", "NTA.  I guess he's insecure about the \"possibility?\" of you leaving him for another woman??  IDK.\n\nEither way.... this is a red flag of sorts.... He shouldn't be THIS threatened by a comment about a movie star.  If you were actually complimenting a woman at a party, that might be a hint that something is up..... but even if you ARE completely attracted to another woman.... tough luck bro.  Be the best boyfriend you can be..... Be confident in the person that you are.  If she loves you, then whatever she does....

No arguments. No uncomfortable-ness. He fully accepts I swing both ways...ALL THE TIME. \n\nHe made the comment first and you followed up with your own opinion. That's when he changed his mind. It does make me think he's one of those guys who thinks Bisexuality is a pick and choose option. So when you're with a guy, you're straight and vice versa. Basically he's not worth it.

If he's anywhere close to that, you should demand that he educates himself about biphobia and homophobia towards women, and demonstrates some kind of change in his attitude.

There is absolutely nothing for OP to apologize for. I've dated girls that have complimented other women on their looks even though none of them expressed any bisexual interest, and even if they had it's their right to express that they found a person attractive. Nothing for an SO to get upset about, especially when talking about an actor, not like OP was going to jump in an Naboo Starfighter and go on a date with Padme.\n\nHe could think he's converted OP to straight, which is another sign of emotional immaturity as he thinks she must only be attracted to men now that she has been with the greatness that is him. \ud83e\udd23\n\nJake could definitely use some maturing, and therapy. He needs to learn to express his feeling in a way that is understandable, not keep repeating the same word like it's some magic totum that makes everyone see things his way.

He's biphobic and/or very insecure and taking it out on you, trying to control you through silent treatment and yelling, being angry at you for not being a mind reader.

His reaction is way out of line, no matter the reason.", "As a bisexual women, a lot of men like the idea of bisexual women but not the reality.\nIt\u2019s fine in a theoretical fantasy kind of way, but the reality that we can find women attractive, love women and be interested in them can be off putting when they have to face it. I broke up with my ex and dated women, and he told me it didn\u2019t count as moving on because it was with a woman so it wasn\u2019t real. \nThe reality is men that see women as pure sexual objects think we see women the exact same way and that disturbs them because they don\u2019t want to think their girlfriends can be sexual if it\u2019s not revolving around pleasing their man.", "I don't even understand why talking about a dress is in any way sexual. It's not even that the lakeside dress is extremly revealing. It's not even close to Leya's slave outfit, with which I would kind of understand to interpret a sexual context into the conversation. But then maybe I'm naive and don't understand the insecurities of OPs bf.", "> Sounds like he's biphobic.\n\nYeah, and it sounds like he exoticises women loving women, treating it as something some sexualised or vulgar and therefore more inappropriate than heterosexual attraction. He exercises a double standard if he gets to comment on groups of people he finds attractive but she doesn't.

I mean I don't think I have seen such drama over a dress even in shows like Project Runway.\n\nNTA. Drop the boyfriend and any friend that thinks you are an AH for saying you like a dress.

He's a trainwreck and I think OP should dump his arse.\n\nBeing unreasonably jealous isn't great, but it happens. I've had it before with a ex. What I didn't do: blame them.

My dad who is also completely straight will make comments about good looking some men and women are. IDK why her boyfriend acted so weirdly about it. Even straight people can acknowledge beauty in samesex people.", "I think he's jealous. And confused by that jealousy. And he's absolutely an asshole about it. He's also a hypocrite.", "Excuse me? As a man we are biologically wired to look at all women as objects. For you to suggest this is not okay is frankly a little baffling, very offensive and just straight up wrong. \n\nI'm confused why you were even allowed out of the kitchen long enough to make such an uninformed comment. On a side note, you are at least barefoot correct? /S", "I agree with you. I noticed he kept saying OP should know why he's upset. Not explaining himself pushes OP to think what she did wrong, even when she didn't do anything. It's playing mind games and using childish controlling tactics. \n\nThe fact OP is on here because she's not sure if she did anything wrong shows it works.", "Yes. And his reaction to OP\u2019s comment indicates that his remark was intended to be sexual appreciation \u2014 possibly negging OP in implicit comparison, while also telling her what he likes women to wear for him. To him, she\u2019s supposed to be putting on a silk nightgown like Padme\u2019s, not joining in on an aesthetic discussion.", "They were watching Attack of the Clones (the lakeside dress gives it away); Natalie was 19-20 in that one.", "Well she favored a different outfit so I guess I can see why he gave her the silent treatment before blowing up on her.", "Wtf?", "Sure, but I would be very upset if my partner said that they would leave me in a second for another person. That makes sense to be upset over. It doesn't make sense to be upset over saying you like a dress they're wearing.", "You\u2019re not wrong! It\u2019s a more specific term that falls under homophobia. Just talking about the unique ways bisexuals face homophobia (like people telling them they\u2019re confused, acting like they are more likely to cheat because they like multiple genders, you\u2019re attraction to *this* gender is more important than *that* gender etc.). It\u2019s a \u2018all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares\u2019 kind of thing.", "biphobia absolutely is a thing, essentially bigotry towards people who are bi just for being bi. \n\nthis specific instance is absolutely both biphobia and homophobia, but oftentimes bi people receive hate or erasure of their sexuality from within the lgbtq+ community. this would be biphobia but definitely not homophobia.", "It\u2019s absolutely a thing. There are people who get really insecure about bisexuality and believe that bisexual folks are inherently promiscuous and inclined to cheat. Gay men who won\u2019t date bisexual men because they\u2019re afraid bi men will just treat it as a fling before settling down with a woman so they can appear straight. Lesbians who won\u2019t date bi women because they say it\u2019s literally a phase. LGBTQ spaces that don\u2019t respect or welcome or allow bisexuals in heterosexual relationships to participate because they\u2019re \u201cbeing straight\u201d.\n\nBisexual folks have it quietly difficult - a lot of straight people expect it to go away (like OP\u2019s BF) and a lot of the LG part of the rainbow either don\u2019t take it seriously or see bisexuals as \u201ctainted\u201d by \u201cbeing able to be straight\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s extremely rough on bisexual men, but not exactly a picnic all over. Lots of people get really weirded out by the idea that someone didn\u2019t \u201cmake a choice\u201d about what genders they\u2019re into.", "agreed with being on their side but yeah, society likes to make up new words for every little thing now. every generation has it's own little name, we keep adding letting to LGBTQ+ despite the plus being ya know...everything else? we have quiet quitting, loud quitting, zoom and boomers. We jus tlove to give everything it's own name lol\n\nit's just regular homophobia  \n\n\nETA: bring on the downvotes. my only message here is society likes making up words for things that don't need to have their own words", "Honestly this, it's not like commenting on the attractiveness of people of your own gender is a thing that bi people exclusively do.", "Ah, you see, BIC started the movement by allowing us access to writing instruments. It has snowballed since, and we can now read and write and post online!!! There's no stopping the movement. /s", "Yep, totally this.", "Please don't do this to yourself. He made the comment first and you were just contributing to the discussion. You are in no way in the wrong here.\n\nNTA", "No, they aren't.\n\nWhy is it ok for him to be attracted to Natalie Portman but not you? What's the difference?", "So why is he allowed to comment about another woman but you cant about a sexy or handsome man or woman too?", "I see your point, but I honestly think his reaction wouldn\u2019t have been so extreme if she was straight. I do think it\u2019s partly the mentality that all bi people are going to cheat on their partners because we\u2019re attracted to everyone.", "Some gay people also believe these misconceptions about bisexuality, though, so it overlaps with homophobia but is a distinct thing. There are also some gay people who believe that bisexuals are just afraid to fully accept that they\u2019re gay.", "This is a bit nitpicky, but biphobia isn\u2019t \u201cunder\u201d homophobia. That\u2019s like saying transphobia is a type of homophobia - there\u2019s some stuff in common but also plenty of aspects that are separate. It is a separate form of bigotry that overlaps when it comes to attraction to one\u2019s same gender (this is something OP is experiencing), and doesn\u2019t overlap when it comes to being attracted to multiple genders rather than just one. There are specific forms of bigotry that are more common for bi people and it is not just homophobia lite or based in being part-gay. Bi people are more likely than gay people to be homeless, abused, sexually assaulted, and addicted to drugs. The CDC did a massive study but there\u2019s been a lot of others as well.", "Nah. Bisexuals get shit from straight people and from fellow LGBT people, we get to have our own word. Die mad about it.", "... All words are made up. Literally. We name things to help identify them because... GASP, it's important to function as a society!!\n\nYou're not being special or smart by saying stuff like this, just utterly obnoxious and full of yourself lol.", "> society likes to make up new words for every little thing\n\nYes, that is how language works. It's been happening since the dawn of time. We have rocks, and boulders, and pebbles, and stones. We have forks and sporks and dessert spoons and tablespoons, teaspoons, knives, steak knives, butter knives, etc. We have gay, straight, lesbian, bi, pan, ace, ect. Language becomes more specific as we advance as a society and recognize nuance. If you're not uncomfortable with someone specifying what spoon they're asking for or they're going to a lake, not a pond, you shouldn't have a problem with someone specifying who *they* find hot. If you do, that's a you problem.", "Agree and I\u2019m straight and I can still assess other women as pretty or even sexy, even though I\u2019m not attracted.  The boyfriend has major red flags.", "Thank you! I was lost too - Women comment on other women's clothing all the time. I'm lesbian and totally did not read that as sexual.\n\nMy eyes would go rolling out the door with this boy.", "I think it's classic Reddit syndrome of \"I asked about this specific problem but they saw through the bs and are pointing out the massive problems with my relationship but I don't want to break up, guess I'll stick my head back in the sand\"", "lmao im not mad about it im just pointing something out. I love that you see it as an attacvk on bi people even though that was one example out of many I gave for a multitude of words.   \n\n\nfeel free to have your own word but yeah, it's still homophobia \\*shrug\\*  \nI could care less, but I get to think it's silly.   \n\n\ndie mad about it lmaoooo", "Ok, baby.", "This is the way. Which reminds me I have to tell my guy about this woman I saw at a bus stop yesterday. He missed out.", "hahahah yeah, I'm the baby  \n\n\nabsolutely hilarious", "Whatever you say, comrade.", "you mad bro? you seem mad"]}
