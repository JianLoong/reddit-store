It\u2019s been emotional as it was where she gave birth to our children (8 and 3) and we\u2019ve made  memories there as a family. But honestly I am glad we are moving. We\u2019re only moving 45 minutes away but its much better for us.\n\nI own a small company with 6 employees and we\u2019re short staffed as it is. My wife and I had a moving date set and there was nothing I could do to change it, meaning I had to take a day off work to help my wife with the move. I booked this day off in advance, as soon as I knew and put in plans for my staff to keep business going as usual. \n\nUnfortunately, yesterday, the day of our move, one of my staff called in sick and said they will be taking 2 days off until they feel better. I couldn\u2019t really do much as I was currently loading up the contents of my home into 2 moving vans. It was not ideal but I informed my other staff who understood.\n\nMy wife and I were meant to get the keys between lunchtime and 2pm. There was a significant delay meaning we didn\u2019t receive them until 6pm. For 4 hours straight, my wife and I were stressed as we thought there was an issue with our new house and we wouldnt be able to move, despite the fact we had just sold our home to another party. \n\nMy wife was getting more stressed as time went on, we still had to feed and settle our kids and we didn\u2019t even have beds or mattresses for them to sleep on yet. At one point, she was almost in tears. I was stressed too but tried to reassure her everything would work out. We finally got the keys but we were exhausted.\n\nAfter a long day, we got the essentials out of the moving vans such as beds for our kids, some clothes, and I ran to the shop to get something for dinner. I tried to settle them as quickly as possible but as you can imagine our 3 year old was tired and cranky.\n\nWe left everything else in the moving vans for the evening and agreed to just do it all the next day. This morning, I got dressed for work, my wife stopped me immediately. She told me I am selfish for going to work today as the vans have to be returned by a certain time and theres no way she could move everything in just a few hours. I told her I had to go to work today as a manager who is already down on staff. One of my other workers had a midwife appointment that she had scheduled in weeks ago and couldnt miss, meaning we would be even lower on numbers and after checking in yesterday, they struggled quite a bit with the workload, meaning I needed to be back as soon as possible.\n\nMy wife said I am an asshole expecting her to move all of our belongings and look after our two children and that I would have to take the morning off at least. Unfortunately my workers midwife appointment was scheduled for the morning.\n\nI went to work anyway, I told my wife I will be home around lunch time to help, but she text me saying she will have finished it all by this point so don\u2019t bother. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693581263, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1679vwr/aita_for_going_to_work_today_meaning_my_wife_had/", "score": 3727, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ooof. I get you were in shitty situation, but the second you realized how tight everything was going to be and how needed you were at work, you should have started looking to get movers or friends or taskrabbits (anyone!) to help move things off the truck and into the home at least. Moving *everything* herself with two small children, good heavens!\n\nEdited to add this because it keeps coming up in the comments:\n\nWife **DID** manage to get help over and got it all done herself, while caring for the children. She didn't know he'd planned to go to work in the morning:\n\n>We left everything else in the moving vans for the evening and ***agreed*** **to just do it all the next day.**\n\nWe (at least I) are judging for OP going into work in the morning after agreeing to do the unpacking the next day the night before, leaving it ALL in wife's hands and not considering getting her help in any way before leaving.", "YTA for not hiring movers and putting everything on your wife's shoulders.", "YTA - you had 2 vans of stuff to move and planned to do it all yourselves in 2 days??  Closings always have hiccups and can have delays.  You needed to plan better.  Either plan for additional days or have movers.\n\nI read your comments about how it was unintentional that everything fell on your wife, and that you didn't need movers until everything fell apart, and all that's great, but it all boils down to the fact that **you went to work and left your wife to deal with everything on her own**.\n\nYou know, there's a pretty famous saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  You need to do better.  Hell, go on the local neighborhood FB page and hire college kids to come and unload the trucks if you can't get \"real\" movers, or call all your friends and ask for help.  ANYTHING is better than what you did.  You need to apologize like your life depends on it.", "Info- How would your wife be able to move all your furniture by herself?   Your story makes no sense.", "You keep saying its unfortunate,  but when things started going wrong instead of recruiting movers you just defaulted to letting your wife do everything.\n\nThat makes YTA.", "YTA. You made her unload all y'all's stuff while wrangling two small children? Sounds like you are so accustomed to offloading things on her that you didn't even realize how unreasonable a demand you were making. Stop putting everyone and everything else ahead of your family. She already knows she can move without you.", "YTA. Have you never heard of the concept of hiring movers? It's not like you were born and raised in that home, you've surely moved before and understand that there are people who can be hired to assist with these things. JFC.", "YTA you chose work over your wife dude", "YTA-   Wife has to parent two children and move home because you - the boss - couldn\u2019t take another half day / days holiday?   \n\nSo massive unfair division of labor in your family and pretty poor planning at work if you don\u2019t have any one to delegate too.  Do you not trust your employees to cope, what is your succession plan if  you break your leg etc. \n\nThat goes with out saying.  BUT the cherry on the asshole cake is -    when you agreed with your wife \u2018we would leave the stuff in the vans and deal with it tomorrow\u2019 were you clear you meant \u2018WE would leave the stuff in the vans and ShE would deal with it tomorrow\u2019?   It sounds like you said what ever you could to shirk the hard work and put it on her- if she\u2019d known you weren\u2019t going to be there you could have extended the van hire, hired people to help, kept working that night.", "YTA, I have a dad like you, couldn\u2019t count on him for anything. \u201cBecause he had to work\u201d, he put everything on my mom\u2019s shoulder growing up. He wouldn\u2019t even think about problem solving, later I realised he was letting my mom do everything because it was easier for him. \n\nI resent him for how tired my mom always looked growing up.\n\nYou knew/decided you had to work the next day and still chose to leave everything in the moving vans for tomorrow. Knowing it would be on her. You let your poor wife carry everything on her own. \n\nAt any time you could have decided to solve the problem: close the business for a day, ask friends or family to help out, only go to work in the afternoon, hire help. Instead you chose what was easiest for you. Do nothing.", "YTA - you both moved but you just dumped all the work on her.", "YTA.\n\nIf I were your wife, I would have taken the kids out for the day and let you deal with getting everything out of the van all by yourself. \n\nIs this a money thing ? Are you too cheap to hire movers ?", "YTA\n\nBut at least your wife now knows where her and your kids place is on your priority list (somewhere on the bottom if even still on the paper).", "YTA, dude that is so fucked. You said you owned the company, should have closed for the day. You did your wife super dirty.", "So presumably with your wife in and out of the front door numerous times unloading on her own  from the vehicles who do you think was going to keep an eye on the 3 year old and stop them from getting out or into mischief or did you expect the 8 year old to do that?

Your last response makes me think you've never has the experience of looking after him on your own so have no idea how exhausted your poor wife would have been.", "Yta you rather put your wife out instead of your co-workers at the end of the day a job is just a job.", "People like you piss me off. You came to reddit to get our opinion, and the overwhelming majority finds YTA. Yet instead of acknowledging this you double down and try to defend yourself in the comments. I see from your replies that the only person you deemed was a \"fair assessment\" was from someone that claimed you weren't the AH. Either get off your high horse or get off this subreddit.", "INFO: what kind of small business do you run and how badly would it be being short staffed for another day or even half day? Did you try to find someone else who could help with moving?\n\nPart of me is baffled that two adults with kids would opt to move a house worth's of belongings to a new location without additional help. Professional movers aren't affordable for most people, but not asking friends/family or finding some young people?", "OP was so focused on the person who had a midwife appt, and couldn't care less about the wife at home with two kids, his kids.\n\nHonestly OP, I hope you're a better husband and person to this lady, and this is a singular event. Otherwise your wife could so easily find someone else who would do the bare minimum to help her. You better hope there aren't any handsome and helpful neighbours at your new place.\n\nStep up OP. This is was a reallly selfish move.", "I am moving in three months and I am hiring movers to do the work.   \n\n\nWhy did you, Mr. Self Important, not hire movers?", "YTA  You should not have left her to handle all of this by herself with young children.  The least you could have done is hire some people to help her if you needed to be gone.", "YTA. Your wife was in tears yesterday and you still left this all to her?", "YTA.  You should have figured this out!  Either you take the time off work or your hire people come and help your wife.  How did you expect her to move furniture from a moving van by herself?  AND watch two kids?  You're lucky she didn't change the locks on the house and tell you to hit the bricks.", "YTA you just showed your wife very clearly that work is more important than her and your family. I\u2019ve moved several times with my spouse and young kids, we\u2019ve either hired movers or my spouse took a week off work because delays happen and asking one person to watch 2 kids and unload moving vans by herself is unreasonable. What will happen in the future when one of your kids or your wife has a major life event (cause moving is a major life event) and your business is short staffed? As far as your wife knows you\u2019ll go to work because that\u2019s what\u2019s most important to you, not your family.", "YTA.  Something had to give when both your co-workers needed help and you were in the middle of a very large family task (and I also noticed that you phrased it 'took time off to *help* my wife').  You chose to dump all your personal responsibilities on your wife .\n\n  Is she often treated like the default parent and the default chore/errand/cleaning serf?  You were very comfortable abandoning her to move an entire house by herself.  How much more have you just let slide because the wife will pick up the slack?", "**YTA** because you failed to manage adequately at work, you failed to manage adequately at home, and then you made your wife pay the price.", "YTA - While yes it\u2019s shitty to be short staffed at work, I think your employees would understand if you needed an extra day so that you didn\u2019t have to dump all of it on your wife. Either that or maybe there should have been some outside help brought in if you couldn\u2019t stay, like movers or some friends that had some time open. Literally anything so that she didn\u2019t have to do it by herself.", "YTA. You're prioritizing your employees before your wife. Moving is one of the most stressful things people can do and you've left everything on her. How is she supposed to return two moving vans?", "YTA,\n\nMan you own the place, shut it down for the day. Cancel whatever you need to cancel, you asked her to do one of the top 3 most stressful events ever, by herself while watching two children. \n\nCall the moving vans to extend them for the day, all anybody you can to help her, bring the kids into the office, have your wife sit in at the office, I don't know there are so many options. But you are absolutely insane for making her unpack 2 moving vans while watching two small children.", "YTA - to solve your staffing shortage at work you created a staffing shortage at home. You also made a decision that heavily impacts your wife without communicating. \n\nLet\u2019s look at all the ways you could have handled this better: Communicate with your wife, payed overtime to your employees for the day for working extra hours, rented the moving trucks for an additional day or two, paid movers, hired a babysitter, called family/friends. Instead you took the easiest solution for yourself and left your wife to clean up the mess. \n\nI\u2019d love to hear how you expected her to unload couches, beds, dressers, etc by herself.", "Yes, YTA. If your 'business' is so tenuous that you can't take a day off for a family move like this, you should have hired movers.", "YTA. You could have stayed up late or woken up early to move stuff. Or called u haul and said you need the van for an extra day", "You need to come home with a damn good gift. Preferably one in a jewelry box.", "YTA- you can\u2019t seriously expect one person to unload 2 moving vans. Get her some help if you can\u2019t be there yourself. I mean, unloading vans while caring for kids? You are clueless.", "Sometimes our family and home is the job we have work on. So, YTA. If you didn't *hire* movers to help your wife, you are most definitely TA this time.", "YTA. Two people emptying the vans could have been done in a short time. You should have taken the morning to do that then went to work. And with 2 small children, you are a Super Ass.", "YTA.  At the very least you should have organized help for your wife.", "YTA totally", "YTA always. Fvck work for 1 day.", "YTA wtf ....you had no plan b....and that is on you. How could you do this to your wife and kids? Why do you need to ask you are an ass? Where is the help she needs???", "YTA. Shouldn\u2019t have left that for your wife to do. Shitty situation but it was your responsibility to figure it out.", "You\u2019re a great boss and you are failing as a husband.  It\u2019s obvious your wife can\u2019t do it all while watching 2 small children. YTA.\n\nEdit: number of children", "YTA. Dude...why didn't you hire movers or call friends and family to help? That is too much for her to do alone", "YTA.   \nAnd if you don't apologize suuuuuper well you just might be posting about how your wife found a more invested, empathetic, and compassionate \"mover\" to get her stuff out. Yikes.   \n\n\nThere is ZERO way I would be able to wrangle ONE child and empty out a van by myself without getting hurt or having the kid get hurt. Have you even had your kids to yourself for a full day without mom? I bet you'd be surprised at how hard kids are. They are constant. They are relentless. You asked her to shelve her tears, swallow her panic over the delay, take care of 2 very grumpy, haven't-slept, stressed out kids who don't understand what is going on, empty 2 vans, and magically drive them back by the deadline?   \n\n\nWow. Just wow.", "INFO: Does your wife possess the strength of an ant? \ud83d\udc1c Otherwise, how is one person going to move large furniture themselves?", "YTA. Leaving all of that for your wife to handle? Family >>>> work. One is your life, the other pays the bills.\n\nHopefully you at least moved the couch off the van, because you're going to need something to sleep on.", "YTA. Your poor planning shows in both work and personal commitments - where you failed in both.", "YTA", "YTA i get that life sucks sometimes,  but this is waaaay to much to put on your wife who has two kids to tend to as well.  Well i get thats your job but you also have another as well and that\u2019s to your family.  And the fact you didnt even discuss this with her, cause obviously you knew you\u2019d be going in! Huge YTA!", "YTA that is all", "YTA. Obviously an awful situation but you made no effort to ease the load for your partner. You could have extended the lease on the trucks or got someone to come help her. You could have apologised to your staff and offered overtime to catch up. There\u2019s lots of things you COULD have done, but you didn\u2019t. You just left.", "YTA.", "Wow...you are such a giant ah I have no words. And your comments just make things worse. Yes it may be true that ideally you both could've managed without hiring movers. But unexpected things happen. This is WHY most adults choose to hire movers. When the unexpected thing did happen, instead of honoring your commitment and staying back to do your share or even hiring movers last minute, you just...walked off??????? I find this unfathomable. So she had to move all that stuff AND look after 2 kids?? Tbh if I were her I'd actually have left you over this. What an incompetent, moronic jerk you are.\nImo you must be just as incompetent as a business owner as you are as a husband and father if your business really absolutely cannot run without you for a day like this.", "Yeah, YTA. I get it. Shit happens. Every move we made, I had to do it by myself because the Old Guy was military. So I totally understand what your wife is dealing with. However, the second you knew shit was hitting the fan, you should have been on the phone with friends and family to help your wife and/or temp agencies to hire extra help for your business.", "YTA\n\nIf you knew you had to be at work the next day, you unpack everything the night before.  That way you're not leaving your wife to deal with it, return the vans, and watch your children all at the same time, and alone.  That was NOT fair to her at all.", "\"we're short staffed as is\" YTA", "So you knew you were going into work the next morning but still chose not to unload the trucks that night, tell your wife it\u2019s all on her, or call around for help?", "YTA.  This was a difficult situation, but it sounds like you decided to just punt on your wife without addressing the impossible situation you were putting her in.  There was room here for compromise or escaltions, but you instead just said 'see ya in a few hours'.  \n\n\nWe get that you had obligations at work.  But you also had obligations at home.  You and your wife needed to work as a team to find the least painful solution.  For example  \n\n\n'I have to go into work today, as we are critically low on staff, but I am going to call the van rental and extend the rental a day so that we have time to unload the vans when I come home at noon'", "YTA.    \nKeeping that 3 year old safe and happy while unloading 2 vans must have been a nightmare. Your employees could handle 2 days without you. However big their workload was on that second day was nothing compared to what you left your wife to deal with alone.", "YTA  I love how OP comments below  \"We didn't need movers\"   Yeah great,  your wife can handle two kids and two moving vans worth of stuff with no problem.   OP You are cheap and selfish.", "10/10 this guy doesn\u2019t do any real parenting\nProbably tells his wife every day what she does wrong\nDefinitely too cheap to hire movers\nAbsolutely too self absorbed to realize he\u2019s still making excuses \n\n\n11/10 is the AH", "YTA, and even worse, when pointed out exactly how you are, it's excuses to justify the abandonment of your wife when she needed you. So double YTA, if you come asking the question, be ready to hear you effed upped and try to make it right, rather than argue how you were not wrong.\nEdit spelling", "YTA. When you knew the delay in getting the keys was going to mean you weren't going to be able unload the trucks in 1 day as planned why on earth did you decide to leave it till the next and go to work? \n\nYou could have kept unloading that night and got up early the next morning before work, instead you just left it all for your wife to do while taking care of the kids. You could have easily got the worst of it done and just left some for your wife to manage on her own. What you decided to do was thoughtless.", "Uh, seems like you have a reasonable amount of free time at work today given how active you are on this thread...", "N A H - there was no winning for you with this one. You own a business, you're responsible there. You're a parent and spouse, so you're responsible there too. You did everything you could. This is a tough situation for everyone and is bound to bring tensions high. You'll get through it!\n\nEdit - my original verdict was predicted on an incorrect assumption that there were movers involved. I then went to the comments. Not sure why I assumed that reading the post, maybe because it makes sense that moving a full family would require moving support, but yeah OP - YTA. You left her with two kids AND moving the rest of your stuff into the house? Yeah, she has a right to be mad.", "YTA your company is understaffed. You haven't got sufficient redundancy to deal with people not being there. You've made yours, your wife's and your employees' lives harder to save a few quid. I hope they all unionise.", "If you have to ask . Y ? Then u already know the answer ..", "NAH. I\u2019m not understanding how people are being so harsh here. He was down employees and was doing all he could to help with the move at the same time. The wife should have gotten movers just as much as he should have. It\u2019s not the end of the world if the moving trucks were brought back late. Probably would have been less of a charge than hiring movers too. He is not solely to blame for this whole fiasco", "ESH. Everyone keeps saying OP should have hired movers. What's to keep his wife from hiring movers? Personally, I'd have kept the truck for another day until OP could find time. Yes, it's due, but likely just a big fine for bringing it back late. Just let them know so they don't think it's stolen.", "NAH but I understand why she would think that.\n\nYou own a business. You didn't mention your wife needing to take off work, so I'm going to assume she is a SAHM. The prosperity of the family depends on you. Being 2 people down means that nearly 1/3 of the staff is out. With it being a manger who is out, it makes it more critical that you're there.\n\nYou're in a tough spot where you have to balance the immediate needs of your family (moving) with the long-term needs of the family (which is your job). You made plans to be back midday.\n\nYour wife is right too - it is tough to unload the truck with the kids needing help.\n\nYou were in an impossible situation and made the decision you thought was best. I'd recommend having a conversation with your wife where you hear her out about her frustrations. She likely just needs you to hear it and not try to fix it or explain it.", "NAH. Owning your own business is rewarding but brutal - this is exactly the kind of problem that crops up and causes strife at home. A couple suggestions.... Periodically check in and confirm that your wife is on board with the risks and rewards of small business ownership. She'll end up carrying more load at home so it's fair to periodically make sure you're both on the same page.\n\nIf something like this comes up look to see if you can lower her workload in any way. Your business might be down staff but there might be a babysitter you could hire to cover the kids while she handled the trucks.", "NAH. Unpopular, but it still stands.  You were needed at your business. If you had stayed home to help, your employees would have suffered. Every one is saying you should have hired movers. True, but is your wife incapable of making that call? It could have been N T A, for your wife getting pissy and blaming it all on you,  but I'm sure she was stressed too.", "Despite all of the hate you're receiving here, I'm pretty sure none of the judgment here is from the eyes of a small business owner and the risk you take on if the company isn't up to par.\n\nBut imo, the only mistake (not even AH move, just a mistake) was not providing a fair solution to your wife when you had to leave for work. Whether it be hiring movers like others are blasting you for, or recommend taking the extra day fees for the moving vans to remove the rush and help when you're home. \n\nYour wife is also an adult and responsible for finding solutions, and if the in-laws did show up to help; it appears she found one.\n\nNTA, just unusual and stressful circumstances. Try to keep that weight on your shoulders balanced and accept the wisdom gained from this experience.", "Hopefully She is just upset at the situation and will get over it. women want equal rights so there you go", "Small business owners are not always rolling in cash and $2000 for movers is cheap if.you can find that.  Our last move was $5000 and we still moved most of the stuff ourselves.  Depending on where you are at getting movers is not cheap at all.", "Part that im confused about is that she is saying it is too much work for her to do by herself\n\nBut supposedly she is going to have everything done by noon \"so dont bother coming to help\"\n\nSo its NOT too much work. \n\nI would feel bad that yesterday was so stressful, but now she is just pushing herself too hard when its not necessary. \n\nIf you can extend the rental return appointment on the truck please do, this would help ur wife with her stress at least. Even just as a nice gesture to her. \n\nTake the kids out somewhere either during the unpacking or after the unpacking for some relaxation so ur wife can be less stressed", "Maybe you could\u2019ve paid for extra van time? Anyway, you\u2019re NTA. Your employees have lives as well and you didn\u2019t place the responsibility for your move on them. I respect a business owner who recognizes that. It sucks for your wife, but life happens. In the end (maybe much further down the road) you will both have a good laugh about it.", "I actually don\u2019t think your the asshole , esp if she managed by her self to get the rest of whatever was left on her own ,,\nSituation sucks but when you have kids and shit needs done you find a way , good for her , and equally good for you . \nShe figured it out and you did what u felt u needed to . Now make sure you do something extra special for her to say thank you , and nothing dumb or cheesy , but give her a day to herself while you take the kids or do something extra nice together .. make it a good start !", "NAH. It was a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. It's not just work -- it's a business you own and your livelihood. It must keep running. Hiring movers or other professional helpers once the shit already hit the fan is nearly impossible, and if possible, the rush fees would be exorbitant. Your wife's take on it is, of course, fully understandable. Beg her forgiveness and ask her how you can make it up to her. Let's hope you two can get past this.", "This thread is full of people who clearly have no idea what a staffing shortage is, or what it's like to be the leader/manager during them. \n\nNTA op...it's unfortunate but you're wife knows your job and what it might entail. Sadly these things happen.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to keep your job, IE ensure your business doesn't go under. It sucks, but it is what it is.  Someone called out sick, and you needed to cover.\n\nAlso, your wife was clearly lying when she said she couldn't move it all, as she clearly did.", "NTA\n\nYou had to work and god forbid your wife has to move boxes out of the van by herself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I couldn\u2019t really do much as I was currently loading up the contents of my home into 2 moving vans. It was not ideal but I informed my other staff who understood.\n\nMy wife and I were meant to get the keys between lunchtime and 2pm. There was a significant delay meaning we didn\u2019t receive them until 6pm. For 4 hours straight, my wife and I were stressed as we thought there was an issue with our new house and we wouldnt be able to move, despite the fact we had just sold our home to another party. \n\nMy wife was getting more stressed as time went on, we still had to feed and settle our kids and we didn\u2019t even have beds or mattresses for them to sleep on yet. At one point, she was almost in tears. I was stressed too but tried to reassure her everything would work out. We finally got the keys but we were exhausted.\n\nAfter a long day, we got the essentials out of the moving vans such as beds for our kids, some clothes, and I ran to the shop to get something for dinner. I tried to settle them as quickly as possible but as you can imagine our 3 year old was tired and cranky.\n\nWe left everything else in the moving vans for the evening and agreed to just do it all the next day. This morning, I got dressed for work, my wife stopped me immediately. She told me I am selfish for going to work today as the vans have to be returned by a certain time and theres no way she could move everything in just a few hours. I told her I had to go to work today as a manager who is already down on staff. One of my other workers had a midwife appointment that she had scheduled in weeks ago and couldnt miss, meaning we would be even lower on numbers and after checking in yesterday, they struggled quite a bit with the workload, meaning I needed to be back as soon as possible.\n\nMy wife said I am an asshole expecting her to move all of our belongings and look after our two children and that I would have to take the morning off at least. Unfortunately my workers midwife appointment was scheduled for the morning.\n\nI went to work anyway, I told my wife I will be home around lunch time to help, but she text me saying she will have finished it all by this point so don\u2019t bother. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We're this fiction, something like that quite possibly would carry such a hidden meaning, but in reality it's far more likely to just be how the words came out. Maybe just while typing, but it's also quite possible there was a conversation along the lines of 'should we save this for tomorrow?' 'Yeah', with either party in either role.

The original plan was to move that day and go back to work the next, and that didn't change. The only thing that changed is that one or both of them went 'save this for tomorrow', leading to a misunderstanding about what the OP would be doing that day.\n\nSo while it's easy to look at this and say 'oh, you should have said this more clearly' or the like, what happened here is a very normal miscommunication.
