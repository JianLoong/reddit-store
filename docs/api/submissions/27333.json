AITA?", "selftext": "My husbands family is Jewish. His stepmom is ca non-practicing catholic but acts like she\u2019s religious. I\u2019m Catholic as well.

They obviously don\u2019t celebrate the true meaning let alone make it all about spending QT with family. My MIL (hubs step mom) received a sweater from us. I was so excited bc the woman has everything you can imagine, and my husband always gifts gift cards which I think are lame if you have really good gifts in mind. I found a gorgeous cashmere sweater just as blue as her eyes and was so excited to give it to her. It was obviously expensive as it\u2019s a luxury item, but on sale, it was the same amount we always spend on each of them ($150). My husband said, \u201cthat\u2019s not a good idea. I know my dad.\u201d I said, we\u2019ll great, it\u2019s not for your dad and I know your stepmom will love it!\u201d\n\nFF to Christmas. She opens the gift, across the room, FIL stared and didn\u2019t say anything. To him, it was \u201cjust a sweater\u201d \u2014 as though we spend less on her than everyone else. To me, it was a gorgeous luxury sweater as blue as her eyes that she probably wouldn\u2019t have bought for herself on a whim.\n\nThat night, we fell asleep. FIL had the audacity to call my husband in the middle of the night to demand we tell his stepmom that we forgot to include a gift card along with her gift.\n\nIn the morning, my husband told me what happened. I was furious. Who does that???? And while I\u2019d never expect to defend a \u201cgift\u201d I was so mad my husband didn\u2019t tell his father he was being ridiculous, and incredibly out of line. I was so mad he didn\u2019t just straight up tell him, it is cashmere, we spent the same on everyone, and she is free to return it as the gift receipt was included. And to have a merry Fkng night. \n\nIt caused a big fight ON CHRISTMAS DAY. A week later, he actually dropped off the gift card to avoid confrontation. rather than setting boundaries. Another fight. \n\nI told him, we aren\u2019t doing Christmas gifts with them anymore, and I want to tell them why. It\u2019s not about gifts. I put thought into everyone a gifts and I feel they are ungrateful AH\u2019s.

I know YOU know you don\u2019t deserve that but sometimes we give the people we love wayyyy too many chances to prove us wrong.

So one year I suggested that we change it to Parents bring one present for each one of their kids, and our Santa could give them out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat has been our standard for 15 years now, and it stops the stress and headache of buying for people who are ungrateful or that you dont really know.", "Yep, this is what I would do.

Both were not into organized religion although my Jewish side was very observant.\n\nWe did celebrate both holidays, but clearly my mother was doing it for my father and us kids, and if she had married a Jew, she would not have been celebrating Christmas!\n\nBut since both religions have distinctly different ideas about how or why Jesus was an important person, the meaning of the holiday will of course be different to Christians vs. Jews.", "Wait, what?

The only person complaining about the stepmother\u2019s gift is the FIL.  So, why is it his concern?

The OP could have just made the sweater her gift to the stepmother, and let the husband get his normal gift certificate. \n\n\nInstead OP's decided to supplant her  husband's gift.

Your step brother is okay but his parents are mad and say you should have bought the LEGOS because you do that every year.  You feel that you should have bought the LEGOs, and you buy them.\n\n\nYour partner says she hopes your step brother and parents can't make it to the next family gathering.\n\n\nWho stirred this pot of crap, who has doubled down on that pot of crap, and whose feelings were completely ignored?", "I suspect these gift cards are spent on things HE enjoys.
