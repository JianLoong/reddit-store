Fully remote and a huge pay increase from my last job. I'm super excited about what this can mean for my future and even close present. Today is my third day. \nThis company does annual all-expenses paid party trips, which not only sounds awesome, but is the only time all employees get to meet in person and interact, so I guess it's like team building. \nThe trip is optional, spans from a Thursday to Sunday including travel time, and I'm not sure what I'll be doing work-wise on that  Thursday and Friday if I don't go. \n\nThe conflict here is with my bf. We've been together for over 3.5 years and more recently live together (in his mom's basement, we don't pay rent currently if anyone asks). He doesn't want me to go on the trip. His concern is how far away it is (about 1,130 miles, town to city) and any overly \"adult\" activities that may occur (he mentioned bar hopping, but I'm not even old enough to legally drink yet). \nI need to give a Yes/No response to my company by EOB today (trip is in 2 months), and I'd like to discuss this with bf further/convince him that I will be safe/okay on the trip, but AITA for wanting to go despite his concerns?\n\nThank y'all for listening and sorry if this is a long post.\n\nEdit/Update:\nHello everyone! Wow, this blew up so fast, I can't thank you enough for all y'alls explanations and concern for me. \nTo answer some questions, my bf does not yet have a job, he is actively looking for one. The company trip is employees only, no plus ones or additions. The trip is not required but I agree it will be a great way to start out my new position and get to meet everyone in person. \nTo settle things, yes, I am going on the trip. I responded to my boss to include me and thanked them for being able to bring me along. I talked it over with bf and used some advice from the comments, and while he was upset, he was open to discussion and said I can go but he might be mad at me before/after the trip since neither of us like being alone/anywhere without each other. To help, I will be taking him to his favorite restaurant (our favorite restaurant) sometime before I leave for the trip. Outside of that, I'm not sure what else to say. I'll continue to respond and answer any new questions as I can. \n\nThank you again!", "created_utc": 1683725940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dqyl3/aita_for_wanting_to_go_on_the_annual_work_trip/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
