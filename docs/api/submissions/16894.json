Are you joking?\n\nNTA and this might be as good a fork in the road for this relationship as anything.", "Go on the work trip.  This is your time to mingle with employees and make an impression  on your bosses.  Put a face to the name, so to speak.\n\nDon't let your jealous BF ruin your potential advancement with your company, and maybe make enough money to move out of the basement.  NTA, but BF is.\n\nBy the way, he's working too, right?", "NTA.  This is probably the most important year to go, to meet people at your new job.  Does he think you'd illegally drink in front of new coworkers in a business sort of group?  Seems like a pointless risk and unlikely if you don't have problems with that at home normally.  Even so, he isn't your babysitter, but it would be more of an understandable worry if this were an existing problem.  You're an adult, would be in a group of adults in a professional environment, and things are paid for.", "NTA. He says it's about safety but I wonder if it's about you meeting new people and *his* insecurities. You're 19. This is the time to travel and experience new things/places. If there isn't trust on both of your ends, the relationship is doomed. Go on the trip. Plus, I don't think it'll look great on your part. I can't go because my bf is insecure. I know you wouldn't tell them that but they'll be like, why can't she go? It's fully paid for, lol.", "NTA\n\nYour life your decisions. Bf isn't entitled to make decisions for you.", "NTA\n\nBf gets no say in this. You are an adult and can take care of yourself. Go on the trip.", "NTA! Go! Do not let this boy start telling you what you can and cannot do. It'll never stop. And I'm speaking from experience. Once you give him control of you, you will never get it back.", "Nta\n\nYour boyfriend clearly doesn\u2019t trust you and he needs to get over it. It\u2019s an amazing experience you get to have. I understand he\u2019s jealous but he can\u2019t expect you to give up that opportunity because of it. Say yes.", "\ud83d\ude02 youre 19 and your bf is afraid youre growing up and have independence.\n\nLive your life and if theres no room for him and his controlling, then thats how relationships grow apart", "NTA - you *WANT* to go, so go.  I'm sure these trips will be at least annually so bf needs to learn how to deal with it.", "NTA\n\nHe is treating you like a child and/or being insecure.  It's a WORK trip.  Despite it being a fun, party trip it is still work and you will still have to (mostly) behave.  You will be with coworkers, put in a hotel - it sounds pretty safe. And not going means working out on networking opportunities.\n\nYou are 19. Most people break up w/ their high school boyfriends b/c this is the time you should be growing and experimenting with adulthood.  You shouldn't be holding eachother BACK.  Go on the trip.  You will regret not going.\n\nAlso, he will continue to try to exert control over what \\*fun\\* you can have. Vacation with girlfriends?  Going to bars w/ friends when you turn 21?  NOT GOOD.", "NTA. Please go if you want to go! Don\u2019t let your immature bf hold your life back.", "NTA & it's great they're including yo on such short notice when these things are planned well in advance. Your BF sounds like he has control issues abt you or is insecure as to your 'loyalty'. You can tell them you can't go bc you already have plans but what you gonna tell yourself the next time he tries to control you?", "NTA.\n\nDo not let your boyfriend dictate your career path.\n\nNot going on this optional work trip has a ripple effect you can\u2019t even see, or fully comprehend, so new on the job and so young into your career.

You'll get to meet and greet with a lot of work colleagues you otherwise wouldn't interact with and you'll be able to build professional relationships with people. All of which could benefit you going forward in your career.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds quite insecure tbh. If he's worried about \"adult\" activities or whatever, he is kinda showing you he doesn't really trust you.\nSometimes you have to put your needs and career above someone else's insecurities.\nNTA.", "Take the trip! Enjoy the team building and enjoy the opportunity to build your career. If your bf doesn't trust you then that's another conversation with him, but you're an adult who can make your own decisions. Have fun and tell them you're going!", "NTA\n\n\nI promise you this. If you do not go because your boyfriend is insecure, you will absolutely regret it down the road. \n\n\nJust because you\u2019re in a relationship does not mean the individual ceases to exist. Healthily relationships are ones where partners are okay doing their own thing from time to time, and their partner is okay with that.", "NTA. Very important you go for work networking. You\u2019re boyfriend is being possessive; a red flag for a future with him.", "NTA  You should go on the event.  You should also keep first in mind that you will be making a first impression with your co-workers and managers - so, maybe steer free of any experimental or not very \"professional\" activities. (ie don't get hammered or hook-up, this is just old-fashioned advice - feel free to ignore).\n\nIf your partner does not trust you, that is another discussion.  By the way, you are an adult - you may not recognize it, and your country might restrict your activities, but you are an adult.  Treat yourself like one, and expect others - including your partner to do the same.\n\nYou should go.", "NTA. Bf sounds controlling, or has some insecurity issues at the very least, imo. \n\nIt\u2019s a work trip, not a bachelorette party - there\u2019s still professionalism to be expected, it\u2019s not going to be an all out rager.", "NTA\n\nYour bf can kick rocks. Enjoy the work trip but just really look out for the culture. Do what you\u2019ve comfortable doing but let others set the tone so you get an idea of the company culture.\n\nAbsolutely go.", "Adding to the flurry of NTA \n\nYou don't need to convince your boyfriend, you are your own person. If he's insecure, that's his problem. Go! Enjoy! Have fun!", "You must go and STAY OFF BOOZE. Not for his sake but look controlled and professional. Despite being called a party trip, it is not a party. It is a social gathering of colleagues. I\u2019ve known of employees who\u2019ve gotten fired for behavior on such a trip. Sent packing back to the US from a European trip.", "Nta.  You should go.  His insecurities shouldn\u2019t interfere in your work, even if it is an optional trip, you should go.  You cannot let him determine your ability to do this.  You\u2019re only 19, no bf should be telling you this.", "NTA\n\nThis work trip is important for you as a new person.", "NTA. This trip can potentially help your career or hurt it of you decline. Your BF needs to understand this. If he doesn't, then he is an AH. You don't need to convince him it is safe. I really encourage you to go on this trip, and remind your BF it is a WORK EVENT, not a vacation, in a frat house.", "Go on the work trip. Consider this relationship with you BF closely. It doesn't sound like he has your best interests at heart. NTA.", "NTA. It may be a party trip, but it's also a work trip, which will give you a really great chance to meet some of your co-workers in person, and do some networking that could potentially help you down the line.
