{"id": 932, "submission_id": "ykfvt9", "title": "AITA for not informing my neighbors of a towing contract and getting someone towed?", "selftext": " I have been living and working on my parents' farm for over two decades. When my father retired four years ago I was given full control of the farm and property.  Over time due to urbanization our area has changed quite a bit.  To describe the area, my family owns four large fields separated by a main road. To access the fields my family has constructed two private roads on our side of a tree line that marks the property line. My problems admittedly were a long time coming with urbanization as my farm became the border between the town and open farmland. On the other side of the tree/property line there is new housing developments and across the main road is a shopping center.  With my town being a popular pit stop the roads and businesses can get quite busy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe consequence of this is that people have been parking on my private road despite private property and no parking signs. This severely impedes farm operations because it would get to the point farm equipment and trucks could not leave or enter either of my properties. In the past, I have called the police to deal with the trespassers but their assistance is limited and slow. I have also tried installing gates but removed them after complaints from truck drivers and my farmhands. The \u201ccure\u201d to all of this came in the form of a contract I made with a local towing company. I installed their signs along with some security cameras. Whenever someone parks on my road I can see it from my office and can call the company to have it towed at the owner\u2019s expense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what happened four days ago with a car that blocked a truck driver coming for a pickup. As per the contract, I called the company and within 45 minutes it was gone. I didn\u2019t know this at the time but the owner was a lady who lived in the new development. Yesterday I got a visit from her as she came by to demand I reimburse her. She said that since I didn\u2019t notify her or the development it was an \u201cillegal\u201d tow.  When she said that I wound up snickering as I literally had signs warning against parking on the road. She wound up calling me an asshole and threatening HOA involvement when I told her I won\u2019t reimburse her and that she can leave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1667420044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykfvt9/aita_for_not_informing_my_neighbors_of_a_towing/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What does she think they\u2019re going to do?", "NTA, you don't have to notify people about what you do in your property.\n\nHow you treat trespassers is only yours to decide as long as you comply with local regulations.", "NTA. The posted signs that she failed to read and acknowledge are all the notification required", "NTA at all.\n\nPosting the tow signs up is usually all the warning you need to give there.  It's private property and she trespassed plain and simple.  The laws vary state to state, but I'm pretty sure just posting a sign is all you need to do.  The tow company should have the proper wording in the signage they put up.  I think all it has to do is state that it is private property and that the cars will be towed at the owners expense and that's it.\n\nMy work (law firm) has a small parking lot that's shared with the apartments above.  We have specific spots and they have their spots.  We had to do the same because the tenants kept parking in our spots.  My coworkers couldn't park and had to pay to park at a meter.  So we contacted a tow company and put their signs up.  The next time it happened the car got towed.  It happened another time and the car was towed.  Then it finally stopped.  We never had to do anything beyond putting up the signs and calling for the tow.\n\nIt's not your fault that someone didn't bother to read the sign and got towed.  It's her fault for parking there without reading the sign.  Do not let this woman intimidate you into paying that ticket.\n\nAlso, if you were there before the HOA came to be and you're not actually part of the HOA, the HOA can't do a damn thing to you.  Let her complain to them all she wants, they can't touch you.  \n\nI've had a case about similar where we represented a gentleman who bought a newly built house in a development.  He was the first to buy, so there was no HOA at the time.  There was some issue about a car parked in his driveway.  They tried to sue him and lost because he was never a member.  Unless you joined when they started the HOA, you should be fine.\n\nYou should probably inform the HOA that she's going to complain and let them know that it's private property and if the HOA members can't find parking they're not to park on your private property. You can let them know that they have no power over you, as well.\n\nI hate HOAs.  The concept seems legit, but in practice they're terrible and turn a lot of people against them.  So many ridiculous made up rules that don't amount to higher property values at all.", "Nope NTA.", "NTA.\n\nApparently, people don't take posted signs seriously.  Now, maybe that lady will.\n\nYour property.  Your rules.  Signs advise of consequences.  Their tow is not your problem.", "NTA - I have a business property and deal with this all the time. People call the police when they get towed, argue with me, threaten me, the whole nine yards. If I see them I even go out and politely warn them and ask to move. Some people will call me a B\\* and move their cars and there are some that will park there anyway, despite my warning. It is incredible how people feel entitled to my land. They assume I have lots of space but I need the area they park in for specific customers. They simply don't care.", "NTA - people need to learn how to read and her HOA can't do anything to you.
