When my father retired four years ago I was given full control of the farm and property.  Over time due to urbanization our area has changed quite a bit.  To describe the area, my family owns four large fields separated by a main road. To access the fields my family has constructed two private roads on our side of a tree line that marks the property line. My problems admittedly were a long time coming with urbanization as my farm became the border between the town and open farmland. On the other side of the tree/property line there is new housing developments and across the main road is a shopping center.  With my town being a popular pit stop the roads and businesses can get quite busy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe consequence of this is that people have been parking on my private road despite private property and no parking signs. This severely impedes farm operations because it would get to the point farm equipment and trucks could not leave or enter either of my properties. In the past, I have called the police to deal with the trespassers but their assistance is limited and slow. I have also tried installing gates but removed them after complaints from truck drivers and my farmhands. The \u201ccure\u201d to all of this came in the form of a contract I made with a local towing company. I installed their signs along with some security cameras. Whenever someone parks on my road I can see it from my office and can call the company to have it towed at the owner\u2019s expense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what happened four days ago with a car that blocked a truck driver coming for a pickup. As per the contract, I called the company and within 45 minutes it was gone. I didn\u2019t know this at the time but the owner was a lady who lived in the new development. Yesterday I got a visit from her as she came by to demand I reimburse her. She said that since I didn\u2019t notify her or the development it was an \u201cillegal\u201d tow.  When she said that I wound up snickering as I literally had signs warning against parking on the road. She wound up calling me an asshole and threatening HOA involvement when I told her I won\u2019t reimburse her and that she can leave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1667420044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykfvt9/aita_for_not_informing_my_neighbors_of_a_towing/", "score": 998, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's private property and she trespassed plain and simple.  The laws vary state to state, but I'm pretty sure just posting a sign is all you need to do.  The tow company should have the proper wording in the signage they put up.  I think all it has to do is state that it is private property and that the cars will be towed at the owners expense and that's it.\n\nMy work (law firm) has a small parking lot that's shared with the apartments above.  We have specific spots and they have their spots.  We had to do the same because the tenants kept parking in our spots.  My coworkers couldn't park and had to pay to park at a meter.  So we contacted a tow company and put their signs up.  The next time it happened the car got towed.  It happened another time and the car was towed.  Then it finally stopped.  We never had to do anything beyond putting up the signs and calling for the tow.\n\nIt's not your fault that someone didn't bother to read the sign and got towed.  It's her fault for parking there without reading the sign.  Do not let this woman intimidate you into paying that ticket.\n\nAlso, if you were there before the HOA came to be and you're not actually part of the HOA, the HOA can't do a damn thing to you.  Let her complain to them all she wants, they can't touch you.  \n\nI've had a case about similar where we represented a gentleman who bought a newly built house in a development.  He was the first to buy, so there was no HOA at the time.  There was some issue about a car parked in his driveway.  They tried to sue him and lost because he was never a member.  Unless you joined when they started the HOA, you should be fine.\n\nYou should probably inform the HOA that she's going to complain and let them know that it's private property and if the HOA members can't find parking they're not to park on your private property. You can let them know that they have no power over you, as well.\n\nI hate HOAs.  The concept seems legit, but in practice they're terrible and turn a lot of people against them.

That will likely cover the above with some wiggle room. I mean, just a 24hr door man is gonna be $250k once you account for salary, taxes, and benefits for 4 people. Add in another 100-150k just to have a handyman to do basic maintenance and cover the cost of his basic supplies. Add in another $100k just for insurance on the building. \n\nSuddenly half the budget is gone and we haven\u2019t even gotten to bigger upkeep items, the pool or gym.", "I should laugh at this,but\u2026. feels", "I\u2019m a poor person and I\u2019d love to live surrounded by copies of me\u2026. But I also have sensory issues and work nights so at my last apartment, my neighbor regularly thought I had died cause she hadn\u2019t seen or heard from me in a few weeks and she\u2019s call the cops.", "Condos need an HOA but you're never gonna convince me $1k+ a month is reasonable. I don't need a door man, I need more square footage and a nice kitchen. \n\nOur focus shifted to HOA-less townhouses once we got wise.", "You probably could have gotten him thrown in jail. Unnecessary repairs that financially benefit a board member, and I bet it was a no-bid contract that was well above fair market rates too. I wonder how many financial crimes he committed.", "Great, you don\u2019t want a doorman. Enjoy paying higher insurance for the building, higher insurance for your unit, and dealing with other sometimes costly issues doormen could have prevented. \n\nNow it\u2019s $925 a month instead of a thousand.\n\n\nLike it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to live in a high rise and don\u2019t want a building with things like decks, pools, and gyms. \n\nBut as soon as you have anything above bare bones amenities and a tall building. It\u2019s gonna be $800-1500. It\u2019s not unreasonable at all or a sign the HOA is corrupt or bad at managing or embezzling. That\u2019s just how much things cost.\n\nIt\u2019s also ends up reflected in the price. A high rise condo with amenities and $1k+ HOA could easily be 30-50% cheaper than a similar condo in a small building with a $300 HOA. \n\nUsually ends up only being a bit more expensive when you add mortgage + HOA.", "I wonder. The fees went up and were just tagged in general revenue. They weren't even ear-marked for roof replacement. I sold and moved before they did the replacement but it wouldn't have surprised me at all if they'd spent the money on something else and then added a special levy later.", "NTA", "Tell her three words: go for it\n\nNTA", "Nta. Also if you\u2019re not in the hoa they have no power over you", "You had signs \"private road / no parking / violators will be towed\" - then she has no business being on the road if she is not able to read signs.\n\nThis is FA-FO in it\\`s finest - and what would a HOA be able to do except whine?\n\nTO her, you may be an AH for snickering - as if you delight in her misery - but that is in her mind - conveniently erasing the fact she COULD have avoided this by , dunno, not parking where she shouldn\\`t...\n\nNTA", " NTA. You put up signs.", "> As the great Foxworthy once said \"Here's your sign!\"\n\nIt saddens me that I know this wasn\u2019t Jeff Foxworthy.\n\nAnd then it saddens me more to know that Bill Engvall was actually a decent stand-up comic when \u201chere\u2019s your sign\u201d was the punchline to one of his jokes and not all of his jokes.", "I do like the HOAs.\n\nFor the horrorstories, and the \"how not to behave\" stories.", "I did laugh at it and feels as well"]}
