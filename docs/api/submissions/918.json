You quit in response to that.\n\nHe was an AH for bringing that up in front of your mom months later. Your laugh was in response to that.\n\nEmployers are way too into power-tripping and with today's job market, it is gratifying to see them get called on their BS.", "NTA -- your ex-boss was being a first-class jerk and got called out on it.  He absolutely deserved it.  Whose side is your mother on, anyway?  I can't believe an employer would be so cold and uncaring that they would demand you miss your GRADUATION just to change oil.", "NTA. Let\u2019s face it: either way you weren\u2019t working that day: either you quit or he fired you. He is just trying to turn things around to make himself seem like the victim when he was the one who put you in the situation in the first place. I suspect he also wanted to either brag about you being unemployed or he wanted to be able to bad mouth you on the reference. In any case, he was getting ready to laugh at you.", "NTA i think he assuned you were out a job and trying yo rub it in but it then backfired", "NTA he can give it but he can\u2019t take it.", "NTA. He was ridiculous to threaten to fire you if you went to your graduation, and should have fully expected you to quit over that. He was rude to call you a jerk for quitting on the spot, since you were fully justified in doing so. He should have had no expectation that you'd let that slide and, quite frankly, your mother shouldn't have, either.", "NTA. If he didn't want you to stop working for him, maybe he shouldn't have threatened to fire you. And I'd say laughing at him in the store is no more rude than him calling you a jerk.", "NTA, lol.", "NTA - play a stupid game, win a stupid prize. He wants to builly you because you're young, you put him in his place", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s great. You should cross post on r/antiwork", "NTA.  Old man embarrassed himself.", "NTA.

When I left for university my employer (and colleagues) got together and bought me my first set of pots and pans, and my boss let me come and work the summers when I was back home. Good employers get loyal employees, and no job is worth missing out on key life experiences. Graduations, weddings, births, funerals - you don\u2019t get those days back.

It's the parent (in this case, mother) who doesn't back him up when he stands up for himself.", "NTA laughing at his inflated self of importance and attempt to throw his weight around by trying to make you miss your graduation was the right response. Some people would have responded to him by cursing him out", "NTA: Your old boss thought he was the shit. That he had power over your life. You showed him he doesn\u2019t deserve respect and he did deserve to be laughed at. Your mom is wrong, A-holes getting their comeuppance is like instant karma.

You weren't being mean. I'm not even sure why your mom disapproved.", "Literally had a friend who missed a day at a fast food joint because he had to take his kid to the hospital. He showed up his next day note in hand and had called out like an hour or 2 early. They told him they were writing him up, so he said, \"How about I just quit?\" Of course, the big pants manager said he would not find another job, he Literally walked across the street (college town with this job market) and wound up with an assistant manager job at the burger joint. He is planning on continuing with them until he graduates college and starts what he calls his \"big boy\" job. He had worked the same place since he was 16 missed one day in 10 years and would always pick up shifts at the last minute. He was their best employee but not a kiss butt so they tried to beat their chest, and he \"bye Felicia'ed\" them and walked into a job he probably should have had for years. He is taking the long way through school because... well life.", "OP, I'll laugh with you.

He has inside info to make all kinda sneaky remarks.", "Old (mentality) man embarrassed himself.", "That makes it even better. With his attitude, he won\u2019t be able to keep employees.", "Lol. I just assumed he was older given his attitude about trying to force you to work on your graduation and calling you a jerk for not giving notice. Sounds like an old ass boomer to me (not saying that all boomers are jerks, but they definitely had a different mentality about work).", "Haha, yeah, very true, and he is just snarky enough to do it. I believe it is why we became friends. Our snark levels can be through the roof. He is a good buddy to all and always wants to help, but dang, that tongue can cut sometimes while leaving you laughing (remarkable skill I haven't quite learned).", "Yeah, in my mind I pictured the guy to be like 55+ given his attitude", "I am 25 but I feel like some days I definitely give off that old-man-don\u2019t-mess-with-me vibe. Hopefully not in a way that leads anyone to perceive me as a jerk, but you know, I relate.", "Nice - That vibe can definitely be useful - I'd see it as a gift!"]}
