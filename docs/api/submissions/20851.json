To sum up my feelings, I don't like kids and don't want them in my life. My sister, who we'll call Laura (37F) has twin girls, both 6 years old. Recently, my sister was talking about me to them and now they want to meet me. Apparently they won't stop going on about how they want to meet their auntie. My sister encourages this idea, but I obviously don't feel the same. She's texted me every day for about a week and has called me I feel like 100 times. And all to guilt trip me into spending time with kids I couldn't care less about. \n\nTwo days ago, I gave her a firm answer, like I had been giving her this past week, that I will not meet her kids. So, yesterday night, she decided the best move was to bring them to my house herself without telling me. She said she thought if I saw them in person I'd change my mind. Because, obviously, seeing two dirty, tiny, loud little kids anywhere near my property would change my mind. At this point, I'm very pissed that she would even think of doing that, especially while I was trying to relax after a stressful day, so I told her straight to her and her kids' face I did not want anything to do with them, and how I could care less about their existence. I also asked her why she would even think it was a good idea to come here knowing I didn't want to see them. \n\nSo, of course, like kids do, the girls started crying and pissed me off further. My sister yelled at me calling me a bitch for saying that in front of her kids, despite bringing them here herself. She left after that and I spent the rest of the day with my phone on silent, as she was blasting my phone soon after she came back to her house. This morning, I woke up to the rest of my family blasting my phone as well, calling me an asshole and a horrible person for what I said to her and her kids.\n\nI don't feel guilty for what I did, but now I'm starting to have second thoughts if I was really in the right about what happened that night. So, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1687993027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14lnwzy/aita_for_telling_my_sisters_kids_i_want_nothing/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you realize how traumatic it is for a child to hear something like that? That kind of thing can cause permanent damage. There was no reason you had to say that to them.

To sum up my feelings, I don't like kids and don't want them in my life. My sister, who we'll call Laura (37F) has twin girls, both 6 years old. Recently, my sister was talking about me to them and now they want to meet me. Apparently they won't stop going on about how they want to meet their auntie. My sister encourages this idea, but I obviously don't feel the same. She's texted me every day for about a week and has called me I feel like 100 times. And all to guilt trip me into spending time with kids I couldn't care less about. \n\nTwo days ago, I gave her a firm answer, like I had been giving her this past week, that I will not meet her kids. So, yesterday night, she decided the best move was to bring them to my house herself without telling me. She said she thought if I saw them in person I'd change my mind. Because, obviously, seeing two dirty, tiny, loud little kids anywhere near my property would change my mind. At this point, I'm very pissed that she would even think of doing that, especially while I was trying to relax after a stressful day, so I told her straight to her and her kids' face I did not want anything to do with them, and how I could care less about their existence. I also asked her why she would even think it was a good idea to come here knowing I didn't want to see them. \n\nSo, of course, like kids do, the girls started crying and pissed me off further. My sister yelled at me calling me a bitch for saying that in front of her kids, despite bringing them here herself. She left after that and I spent the rest of the day with my phone on silent, as she was blasting my phone soon after she came back to her house. This morning, I woke up to the rest of my family blasting my phone as well, calling me an asshole and a horrible person for what I said to her and her kids.\n\nI don't feel guilty for what I did, but now I'm starting to have second thoughts if I was really in the right about what happened that night. So, am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And it was an AH move on your sister's part to bring her kids to your house against your clearly spoken wishes. However, you were a MAJOR AH for the way you expressed your feelings to your sister and her kids. You could have said calmly that you don't want this, and maybe then closed the door.

And even then, saying that you *couldn't care less about them is unnecessarily hurtful and mean to say. \n\nAnd also, as other commenters have asked: How will you handle family gatherings? Your sister will definitely bring your nieces there, if not so far than eventually. Will you remove yourself from those gatherings completely until they're 18, just to avoid kids? Or could you still be around kids and just not interact with them all that much if you really don't want to?\nOr do you already not go to family gatherings because you couldn't care less about your entire family?

Your family apparently does care a lot about those kids, like most families care about their kids, and hearing you say that you hate them so much and don't even want to meet them will hurt your family. Your parents for example might foresee that they can't have their entire family together anymore, or at least not without conflict and tension, which is upsetting to them as you can see.\n\nPlease talk to your family; definitely your sister and (if your sister agrees) also her kids.

It seems like she's willing to cross boundaries and invade space.....but maybe three months later it would be her dropping the kids off with no notice, or expecting free childcare.....with the narrative that she's pushed onto her kids about \"meeting their aunty\" - she's the one who set them up for emotional failure.", "My best friend's kid is turning 3 next week. All he wants to talk about is toy trucks. Honestly, he's a better conversationalist than most adults I know lol.", "Th adult responsible for them is her fucking sister. These kids are her nieces. They\u2019re not strangers off of the street. Even if you hate kids fucking fake it for a few years. Jesus Christ buy a few Barbie\u2019s at Christmas and then enjoy them when they\u2019re older.", "You get that by the time they are 17, they probably won\u2019t want to have anything to do with you since you were a jerk to them their entire childhood, right?", "Lol.  Any person you would deem old enough to grace with your ugly company will already have the presence of mind to know you're not worth the time.", "A six year old isn't the same as a baby that just popped out the womb either, genius.  They're small people with feelings that will remember how awful their aunt was to them for simply... being born.", "Wow, going straight for the ad-hominem attacks. The 6 year old twins are more grown up than you.", "What age are they suddenly allowed to talk to you?\n\nI guarantee at any age they won\u2019t want to because of what a hemorrhoid filled asshole you are.", "6 year olds are also not the equivalent to babies just popped out of the womb", "YTA. You\u2019re a ridiculously huge asshole.", "Your brain might not even be done forming so calm down there buddy", "Why the hell would they want to interact with their mean aunt who wanted nothing to do with them their whole lives? Didn\u2019t go to their sports, celebrate their achievements, show love to them. You don\u2019t deserve to have nieces or nephews.", "So your plan is to finally acknowledge their existence once they\u2019re grown? Jesus at that point just go NC with your whole family. You\u2019re so strange, you don\u2019t have to like kids but they\u2019re family at least you could be civil.", "Congrats on showing everyone that you have the emotional maturity of a child with your answer.", "God, what a child.", "You might want to start using yours first.", "You sound delightful. \ud83d\ude44 YTA.", "Six year olds also aren\u2019t the equivalent to babies just popped out of the womb. At what age does a person become tolerable to you? And do you really expect someone to want a relationship with you when you\u2019ve spent their entire lives avoiding them and pretending they don\u2019t exist?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 with how you treated them now you actually think they will want anything to do with you when they're teenagers or adults. If I was them I'd tell you to jump of a cliff..... Grow a brain teenagers start as children \ud83d\ude44", "Use your heart.", "This right here. And there are words for hating entire classes of people. None of them are complimentary.", "My niece is adorable. She's 3 and I can't fucking stand children. But she eats dog food and steals people's \"grown-up cups\" any chance she gets (don't worry, we do try to actively prevent it). It's hilarious, she's just like her auntie Lost. I can't wait til she gets older and I get to lovingly tease her about it.\n\nOP is such an incredible asshat, I can't even.", "This is a big part everyone is leaving out.  They WANTED to meet her, so they must have heard great things about her.  They looked forward to meeting someone who turned out to be a giant ah", "I agree OP is TA here but your imagined scenario about the conversations her sister had with the girls is unlikely. Sister is 11 years older than OP, so they didn't have a shared childhood and probably were never close. My imagined scenario is sister thinking OP *should* like her amazing daughters and pushed a connection that had a low probability of success. Sister is definitely not without fault.", "So the sister is never going to attend family functions anymore because her sister has kids? They are never going to have friends that have children or if their partner has nieces and nephews they won\u2019t want to have them around in their lives either? I don\u2019t see that working out well for OP. Even if they do have a partner that is fine with cutting all events and people that have children out of their lives (because those friends will bring their kids to events that they are able). It sounds like it would be a very lonely life, and that is coming from an introverted hermit.\n\nETA: I don\u2019t disagree that Sis shouldn\u2019t have forced it onto OP. However OP is entirely responsible for their actions and response. You can\u2019t control how others react but you CAN control how you react.", "They wouldn\u2019t have genuine curiosity if their mom didn\u2019t even tell them about their aunt. Play stupid games with stupid prizes", "You must be the OP.", "It doesn\u2019t excuse op being an asshole to 6year olds. Yeah sis was out of line bringing them round but op is x1000 worse for saying that to children who have done nothing wrong. That shit is traumatising. Take it out on the sister not the kids.", "Just because a boundary is crossed does not give someone the right to do whatever they want.", "It's the boundary itself that makes op an asshole.", "The way you are so passionately arguing with everyone in this comment section is weird.", "I\u2019m also a financially independent adult, what about that is relevant here? Financial independence  does not give people the right to act this way.  While OP\u2019s sister should respect boundaries, the response that OP gave was horrendous and dramatic. Just because you don\u2019t like children doesn\u2019t mean you should treat all children like they are the most disgusting things to walk the earth. Very immature.", "You're just as crazy as the op", "this is the most unhinged behavior I've ever read. \n\nlike they are kids, they aren't going to infect you with the T-Virus and turn you into a zombie", "Okay so you acted like you'd never met them before and she wanted you to meet them but now you've seen them at family gatherings but usually they're leaving shortly after you get there? Clearly a made up story. Get your story straight.", "Info: Did you get along with your sister growing up? Because I can\u2019t comprehend someone treating their sibling\u2019s children so vile if they have a good relationship with each other.", "But why", "You absolutely made it seem like you've never met them their entire lives and they've never seen you or that you've ever been around them.\n\nYou intentionally made it seem this way. I highly doubt in 6 years these kids have never once a single time spoke to you or walked passed you in the hallway at a family holiday.\n\nIt's cool you are child free it's weird you wanted to make yourself seem this way.\n\nEdit bc repeated a sentence.", "Is it the one defending their behavior \ud83e\udd23", "mind blown", "There's \"child free\" and then there's \"child hater\". Is OP perhaps Agatha Trunchbull or some other Roald Dahl character?", ">u/squirrelcat88 you wrote a very well written response. That's a great point.", "Yeah I was thinking toddler stuck in an adult body lol", "Why now though. The kids are 6. It's been 5 years and OP hasn't faltered on their view. If I was the kids father, I would be pissed that their mother put them in that situation honestly.", "What part of OP doesn't care did you miss? Like OP absolutely 1000% TA, but it can not be surprising to sister that her sister is... frankly awful (there are many other words, but all of which would get me banned)... And while OP is absolutely TA for how she behaved, **who the fuck puts their children in a position that they are deliberately going to be hurt by someone who clearly has serious issues?** and for that Laura is also TA... hence my vote ESH", "I will stand with OP in she has every right not to meet  her nieces. That is her choice. She can avoid them without being insulting.", "no one is entitled to meet anyone, nor to be involved in anyone\u2019s lives. i don\u2019t like kids and my siblings know this and would never force me to be around their children. my sister has a new born and i stayed away for the first few months cause i especially can\u2019t deal with a new born.", "the children wouldn\u2019t have been traumatized had their mother not brought them somewhere they were unwanted", "Well said", "No it's because people assume that someone who doesn't want kids in their home or life is literally Satan-Hitler-Dahmer-Grinch all rolled up into one fat ball of hate and bile. \n\nPeople going off on OP here sound super entitled. Like the ones who bring their kids to child free weddings then act offended when told to leave once their child interrupts the vows or damages the cake or throws a tantrum. \n\nLet someone who doesn't want kids in their hone ir personal event or place just.. have their space. Its OPs own house. It's not like she went to her sister's and told her to send the kids away.", "Right? There\u2019s some really deep-seated hatred here. It\u2019s fine to not like children, but to hate them to this degree? Their only fault was that they were born. Were you treated badly as a child? Geez.", "Because OP is more of a chlid than the sister's kids", "These kind of child free types definitely make me think like they\u2019re mentally stunted themselves.\n\nYou know how sometimes kids grow jealous of how much attention their new born younger sibling are getting? They cry, shit themselves and are annoying. They don\u2019t understand why so much care and concern is being given to them. \n\nNow imagine if that person never grew out of that mentality and sees all children in that same lens. They don\u2019t understand why society is giving so much care and concern to these annoying little shits.", "Right because the kids really had a choice.  Should have abused the person responsible for bringing them and not respecting a boundary, not be abusive to the kids who a.) Probably didn't know and b.) Had to go with their mom because they are children!", "the kids shouldn\u2019t have been yelled at, but if they were beside the sister then yelling at the sister the kids would have heard. it seems they were outside of a house which means the kids probably couldn\u2019t have not heard, OP made it clear many times she wanted nothing to do with them. \n\ny\u2019all are more stuck on the fact that OP doesn\u2019t like kids and not on the sister disrespecting her boundaries multiple times and showing up to her house with the kids in tow, which in my opinion was very manipulative.", "Because it's more than not liking kids, it's acting like they're contaminants.", "Somebody disrespecting your boundaries doesn\u2019t give you free rein to terrorize bystanders. Be a fucking grownup and address the person who has wronged you, not, again, small fucking children who happen to be standing there.", "because she doesn\u2019t want to be around them ? i don\u2019t like kids and i don\u2019t just put myself in situations to be around kids. if you don\u2019t like dogs would you put yourself in a situation to be around dogs? no"]}
