I estimate that the water you've used so far costs $XX, so do you want to pay me in cash or Venmo me or what? Also, I have concerns about continuing this arrangement given the repeated issues I've had with my driveway getting blocked, my property getting flooded and trash being left by your workers. Can we discuss what your plans are for making sure that doesn't happen again?\"\n\nNTA. You aren't overreacting, if anything, you've been underreacting. Construction is a messy, noisy, time consuming job, no doubt about it. But that doesn't give construction workers the right to trespass on your property, much less vandalize it through their carelessness.", "NTA - You're paying the cost of that water and receiving no benefit from it.", "Nta\n\nShut that shit down. They can't do it considerately they can't do it at all.", "Nta. I'd go over and tell them effective immediately they are not to use your utilities or property and that forthwith you expect them to keep the debris and mess OFF of your property.  And I would be demanding compensation for an increase in your water bills, cleaning costs of your outdoor items, replacement/landscaping costs for the lawn etc  I'd tow anyone in my driveway too. Your partner is an ass and had no right to allow the neighbours to mooch off of you. And the contractors are asses and bad businessmen because they should be showing respect for the people in the area...if they were halfway decent they'd be going the extra mile for you because it's their reputation  that is affected.", "**NTA**, fuck 'em, you have no obligation to be of service to them.\n\nBut if you're looking to have them treat your property better, it could be a good idea to ask to talk to whomever is in charge and tell them that you require them to do this and that, in exchange for being able to use your water, and that if they don't you'll turn the water off without any further warnings or negotiation. If they comply, great, maybe it's worth it. If not, well, at least now you \"gave them a chance\", which makes you seem more reasonable.\n\nIf you on the other hand just tell them to fuck off out of the blue, or even worse with some complaints they'll perceive as whiny, now you're the unlikable person nextdoor who caused them trouble, and whom they are definitely going to be keeping an eye out for ways to discretely fuck with. You might regret cutting them off, if not done the right way.", "NTA- say when they asked to use your water that you didn\u2019t realize how much they\u2019d be using and you are concerned about your water bill.

And insist your boundary lines are respected.", "NTA.  It's ridiculous that your partner gave them permission in the first place.  And tell them that they no longer have permission to be on your property.  If any workers are on your property, you will call the police for trespassing.  If they leave any building materials or other items on your property, you will confiscate them and turn them over to the police.  And you will be sending a bill for this egregious waste of YOUR water, to them, and expect immediate payment. And an apology.", "NTA\n\nYou're paying the water bill, you do what you want.", "NTA - The builder is, and he needs to get his circus under control.  Unless he's paying you for the water, he needs to find his own source, and he needs to have his people stay where they belong and clean up after themselves.", "Nope, you WNBTA. Just the fact they are crossing boundaries and trashing your property is enough to shut them off. But wasting water and not paying for it? No freaking way. Let them bring in a water tanker.

Construction goes on everywhere, sure, but part of new construction is taking measures to not destroy any neighboring properties, let alone unduly inconvenience them.

I hope you\u2019re documenting all the property damage and billing this builder for it. It\u2019s one thing to be reasonable about dealing with extra mess, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be putting up with people parking on your property without your permission and damaging your yard. I almost wonder if the reason the town won\u2019t connect their water has something to do with the fact that they are rushing this process and aren\u2019t doing things the right way, much as they are with relation to not taking adequate precautions to safeguard your property from their destructive mess. It might be worth involving your local zoning authorities. They\u2019re cutting a lot of corners, and that means there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019re building a sub-code structure right next to yours.

I would demand to talk to them, and figure out what governmental department you should make a complaint to - and no, you don't need to give them your water, especially not for free!!!", "NTA - Turn off the access ASAP (shut off valve). You should not be asked to supply a basic need to a builder who is paid bank.  Take pictures of their actions on your property and file it with the corporate office. Continue this until things improve. . They are not respecting you.", "Uh, NTA. Why is this even a question? They\u2019re a BUSINESS taking advantage of a private citizen. Your partner is a fool. Tell them to keep off your property, too, and ask them to pay for cleanup of any dust that gets on your house.", "Oh hell no. You need to find out who to file a complaint with.

I am on public water and have to pay for every gallon.  Our sewer bill is also pegged to water usage.  \n\nWill the new home have a private well or be on public water?  Either way water for the new house should be available after 8 months but the new owner or builder probably just does not want to pay for it!\n\nThe builder has no right to use or block your drive or tear up your lawn!

Part of the job is managing logistics, including sourcing and staging supplies. If you explicitly gave them permission to be on your property and use your water and store things in your yard, that would be one thing. I think it\u2019s time to have two conversations: one with the builder lead about unacceptable use of your property, and one with your partner about how your preferences are valid (and legally allowed to shape how your land is used).

The builder told my partner they would give us money for it though those details were not worked out, and they have given us no money.", "Fuck that. They've had time to figure out the details. Probably pushing it as long as they can until you say something", "Well if they haven't paid, then NTA, but if they start paying for it I wouldn't say no. I would workout the agreement and hold them to it, and have them pay you for what they already used, and continue to let them use the water as long as they paid.

There were contractors everywhere. Parking in front of my driveway, blocking the city from collecting our yard waste, etc.  For many years, I was a landscaper, and I know what it's like to work in people's yards. One of the contractors asked if he could use our hose water to wash his hands as the house they were working on wasn't hooked up. Sure, I said.\n\nFast forward to a month later, and they are using our water for *everything*. Making a huge mess, using it for paint and plaster, getting construction dust all over my plants.

Contractors will absolutely take advantage of kindness (like mine, or OP's partner). Call their office and bitch.", "NTA - WHO IN THE ACTUAL FUCK IS PAYING FOR ALL OF THAT WATER!!!  The person paying the bill has the ultimate say.  DO NOT let your partner give you crap.  Just because he works in construction is in no way relevant to this.  To be honest, the first day you noticed they were using your water is when you needed to have spoken up.  These guys are walking all over you.

I'm actually upset for you on this.", "I really hope OP took pictures of all this.", "Take this advice.  I had something similar happen to me when I lived in a neighborhood with new construction. Came home and a water hose was hooked to my hose bib for the workers doing concrete work next door.  They didn\u2019t even ask me.  Disconnected the hose and told the contractor that the builder was making money on this new construction not me.  Have him hook up to the city water.  If they did it again I was calling the police.  Contractors know what a job entails.  You were an easy mark.  Make sure to get the money due you.", "Because they are either cheap, or working without proper permits or utilities.

End of story.", "NTA\u2026who is paying for this water?!  Stop that nonsense now.  And that house does not sound legal. Land versus house size.

But properties adjacent to the job site? No sir (or ma'am or whatever you identify as)! Shut that shit down, not just the water situation but anything happening on your property. There are usually government bodies that can help (depending on where you live) as well if they won't do it themselves. They are damaging your property and subsequently devaluing it.

The general contractor was notorious for getting jobs with low bids, then pushing change orders for work he was supposed to be responsible for in the first place. Solution? Schedule a meeting to discuss proposed change orders. Serve bagels and coffee. Then gave an impromptu safety inspection walk thru in which even the tiniest issues (unswept gravel, napkins from fast food lunches) was identified and tagged for cleanup/correction. Once faced with 2-3 days of safety work that had to be completed before work was resumed, the contractor was only too happy to back down on the change orders.\n\nNTA OP. If the neighbor's contractor wants to use your water, he can clean up the site, put up a temporary fence protecting your perimeter, stay off your driveway and property, designate one person responsible for the water connection whose full name and cell phone number you have (to prevent others from going on your land), provide window cleaning for your home and lawn restoring services for your yard, and pay for the water. Be nice but stick to your guns. If there are any issues moving forward call the local building office (city or county) and lodge a complaint."]}
