That's why networking is a thing.", "It is obvious that Lia is jealous, but it is impossible to comment if she has grounds to be so. Either way, what she did was in poor taste. Best to move on.\n\nEdited: OP has provided more info.\n\n*She started working here a couple of years before me*\n\n*I also applied for that position but didn't get it, which is fine. The one I got is also very good, it's a sister company of where I'm currently working*\n\nOP, unless you are incredibly brilliant or she is amazingly bad, overlooking a long standing worker for a promotion is indeed nepotism. You cannot spin this to look good. Best to accept it. Note that you did not get the offer she got. Your offer was from a sister company which opens up another can of worms about favoritism.", "INFO: Everyone was congratulating you on your promotion. Were they also congratulating Lia on her new job?", "This is almost as good as the guy last week calling himself a hard worker after inheriting a factory from dad.", "YTA\n\nEdit: OP replied to comments and said the job offer Lia got is not the same offer she got. She and Lia both applied to that company, but OP didn't get in.\n\nThis isn't the big thing though - the other offer that OP got, but declined, is a sister company of her current workplace. No shit she got an offer from there.\n\nLet's break down what Lia said.\n\n*Lia overheard this and came at me, saying \"it's not about my options but my nepo privilege\" and how \"she got a new job too but everyone's kissing up to my ass\".*\n\nI'll talk about the second quote first. I mean, even from your description of this potluck it doesn't sound like everyone was busy congratulating you - which is great and all - but pushing her to the side. She got a new job which is a big achievement. Maybe she could've worded it better than kissing up to your ass but it doesn't sound like she's wrong.\n\nI'm not sure what the job is and maybe it isn't considered \"big\" in your family, but this doesn't mean she doesn't deserve to be celebrated like you.\n\nThis also brings me to the first thing she said about your nepo privilege. Is the job offer you got, but declined, the same job she got and accepted?\n\nIf that's the case, maybe she had to go to the other job because she didn't have the options you did (getting promoted at the current company). I'm not saying you don't work hard, but it's wrong to deny your boyfriend's dad co-owning the company has absolutely nothing to do with your position, not even a little bit.\n\nBut what makes you TA in what your said is your \"bitch\" comment. There's no reason for you to lash out at Lia and call her a bitch. Yes she might be jealous of you, but bitch isn't a response to that.", "YTA - you lack self awareness. You can call yourself a hard worker. It sounds nice, but you can\u2019t deny the situation is advantageous to you \u2026 in a nepo way. \n\nCalling someone a bitch for stating the obvious is definitely an AH move.", "YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t know if \u2018nepo privilege\u2019 is the right word, but surely the fact that you work at a company co-owned by your boyfriend\u2019s father does mean *something*. I\u2019m not saying you aren\u2019t a hard working employee, but you\u2019re definitely very safe at this job for a reason. Anyways this isn\u2019t why you are TA. YTA because there was no reason for you to call her a bitch. She had a point that everyone was paying a lot of attention to your promotion, when she herself was also doing pretty well in her career. I find nothing wrong in how she feels about that. There was no reason for you to lash out at her unhappiness because of the biased treatment she was receiving from everyone.", "YTA. She was acting jealous...but I think she has a reason to feel jealous and bitter, frankly. She has a new job and is moving out of state yet at dinner everyone was focusing on you; that sucks. You absolutely do have an advantage in the company you currently work for and, whilst I'm sure you do work hard, for her that sucks too. I don't think she's a 'bitch' for vocalising this.", "ESH. There is no need to throw it in her face. I don't think it's a big stretch to say your status as the girlfriend of the co-owners' son didn't play at least a small part in your promotion.", "She\u2019s just saying the truth and what all your coworkers think, but the way she said it was inappropriate. You really shouldn\u2019t work where you fuck op.

I too suspect that \"nepotism\" had some role in your getting hired at the company in the first place, and your promotion. Your boyfriend's father owns the company! \n2. You called her a \"bitch\" which was pretty rude. \n3. You told her to \"focus on herself instead of looking at what others have that she doesn't.\" Since what you have and she doesn't is, apparently, a boyfriend whose daddy owns a business, it's not something you should really be bragging about.", "Eh I\u2019m torn here. Most folks who benefit from nepotism claim they don\u2019t, they\u2019re just hard workers, but without knowing you both in real life it\u2019s hard to say who\u2019s the AH. You were pretty harsh but she was pretty aggressive\n\nThat being said I can sympathize with your cousin. She got a new job and is moving out of state- did anyone at this event bother to congratulate her and tell her they\u2019re proud of her, or did they spend the whole time fawning over you?", "INFO: is it typical that your accomplishments are acknowledged and celebrated more than hers?", "YTA. Not saying her exploding was okay, but she isn\u2019t wrong. You have to realize you had an advantage with it being your boyfriends father\u2019s company. I\u2019m sure you are a hard worker, but you had a step up.", "ESH\n\nShe could have left it alone even though she may not be wrong, she's leaving soon so what's the point. You didn't need to call her a bitch. \n\nHonestly, a lot depends on how you act towards her day to day and what special privileges you may get that you don't seem to think you get, but none of us can tell that from the post.\n\nBasically, if you and your boyfriend broke up, would everything be the same at work for you in terms of perks and working conditions? If not, then that IS nepotism and you're  lacking self awareness.\n\nEdit: Adding you can be both a hard worker AND benefit from nepotism. They aren't mutually exclusive concepts.", "You do have an extra advantage due to your boyfriend\u2019s family whether you want to acknowledge it or not. I\u2019d probably only boast about my promotions if I was working for strangers, not family. And I\u2019d never call someone a \u201cjealous bitch\u201d for having common sense. \n\nStill, she didn\u2019t need to come at you the way she did. Both you and your cousin seem to lack social etiquette, especially with family present. \n\nESH.", "YTA you don\u2019t deserve to be there, when you applied for jobs that your bfs dad didn\u2019t own you did not come up to par. She has every right to be mad at you", ">I'm happy I have options on what I want to do.\n\nAlthough I don't think you intended it the way she is likely to have taken it... This is what started the snipping. \n\nTo you it seems that Lia came at you out of nowhere. \n\nBut although you know both parties and see them together in public, you do not have intimate knowledge of the complex relationship between Lia and her stepmother.\n\nHER stepmom, who by all rights should have been celebrating HER achievement, was congratulating you (nothing wrong with that, in itself) on your accomplishment, and your response was to share that... actually you're even *more* accomplished, because you got this other thing similar to what Lia got. And then pointed out that you had the one thing she *didn't* have... options.\n\nAgain, I don't think you meant it as a dig at Lia. But I also don't think either of us know what other digs she'd put up with before that snippet of conversation. Knowing how complex familial relationships can be... I'm betting stepmom had already (even if unintentionally/lovingly) made a comparison.\n\nYes, Lia was obviously jealous. But what you read as a petty, jealous attack... I think most of us are reading as a hurt, jealous defense.\n\nYou do have options. And I'm sure you've earned them. I'm sure Lia has *also* earned them. But she does not have them. \n\nAnd if even a tiny fraction of the decision was made because of your relationship to the boss, that *is* \"nepo privilege\".\n\nIt's not an insult/attack, in Lia's eyes, but a statement of fact.\n\nCould she have phrased the \"kissing up\" part better? Maybe... but it wasn't an attack on you anyway. It was an attack on *other people's* behavior.\n\nYou said you'd \"had enough\"... but you list this as the inciting incident and say \"she seemed fine\" before that. \n\nThis wasn't a \"last straw\" situation... it was the first straw.\n\nMeanwhile, she probably *had* \"had enough\" of being ignored and passed over at a family event where, though you'd both achieved something, everyone was ... \"kissing your ass\".\n\nThe courteous thing to do, would have been to say, \"Hey that job you got was amazing! I'm not sure why no one is celebrating BOTH things.\" Or ... yknow... just walk away. Or even say, \"I don't think it's nepotism, because I do work hard.\"\n\nInstead you attacked her. And not in some \"was it or wasn't it?\" sort of way. \n\nYou resorted to name-calling, and told her to *focus on herself*, which is what she was *trying* to do in the first place.\n\nYour friend is right. You should apologize to Lia. What you said was way wrong.\n\nShe could have behaved *better*. But she wasn't trying to hurt you, she was trying to right a wrong.\n\nYou set out to wound.

There really is not doubt here and you're very ignorant about it.\n\nYes, she is jealous but calling her a bitch when she's just saying the truth (a bit vulgar though), does not warrant said treatment. Also, you should reflect on what you said and realize that you have privilege she doesn't and you should be aware of that instead of saying that she should work on herself. I don't know which one of you is more competent but you clearly have more connections that will get you a lot further than she might in your field.\n\nPlus, your family sucks. Your nepotism is as clear as day, but your family seems to be as ignorant as you and nobody seems to congratulate her for her new job that's taking her to another state (further away from family and she won't be able to attend get togethers as often, I assume). So, you're obviously the favorite compared to her.\n\nLastly, I was actually pondering whether or not Lia is also an ass, but I'm going with not because I don't believe this was an isolated incident.

Do not kid yourself there. Your boyfriend's dad has extra incentive to keep you happy, and if you were starting to explore elsewhere, then yeah, really convenient timing on that promotion. It keeps you working for bf's dad, in the same area, and bf happy. \n\nThat said, that doesn't mean you aren't a good worker, as promoting you if you weren't would be stupid. You just may have had a slightly easier time to prove yourself a good worker and have a better opportunity to keep doing so.\n\nThe flip side is your cousin may have felt pushed out because she realized you may always be given the nod over her. If she wants to advance, you are actually a road block, so she may have felt like she was forced to go elsewhere. I can't say whether or not that feeling would have merit or not, but the situation does make it plausible it's not wrong. She still gets an AH vote because that's not your fault and you'd be stupid to shoot yourself in the foot in case it is true. And it may not even be. You get an AH vote for not recognizing this and being oblivious to possible nepotism.

This argument was bound to occur.\n\nNepotism is the theme but actually not the major problem here...Also OP got an opportunity somewhere else. \n\nBut if the cousin is this insecure that may be why she isn't getting as many opportunities and rubs ppl the wrong way. Also for all we know, perhaps all those congratulating OP  also think the same way. \n\nI feel like everyone saying YTA are the type who come here because they like drama and are quicker to blame someone else--like what the cousin did...", "I hope Lia gets to D.C., gets some of that good weed, listens to some go-go, and loses EVERYBODY'S numbers and blocks ALL OF Y'ALL.", "Look at OPs comments - she\u2019s a b**************", "This should be higher!!! \nOp: yta. And a liar", "I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s no nepotism here, there very well might be.\n\nBut the mere fact that one of them got an offer at the FBI and the other didn\u2019t isn\u2019t conclusive evidence that she\u2019s an objectively better candidate in the other roles. There\u2019s so many factors that go into a hire beyond a resume; she might\u2019ve interviewed better for that particular interview, or maybe her resume and personal circumstances were better suited for the public sector than OP, especially one as restrictive as intelligence. A lot of government roles will also have additional tests (IQ, logic, personality) that many private sector roles won\u2019t (some still do). \n\nSimilarly, length of service at a company isn\u2019t going to be the only factor considered for promotions. \n\nIt\u2019s very likely that her relationship to the boss\u2019s son influenced the promotion, but it\u2019s not impossible that it was purely on merit either. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s impossible for her to be an objectively great employee because of this relationship.\n\nNTA either way - nepotism may or may not be involved, but she\u2019s still allowed to share and celebrate her success around family without others trying to discredit it out of jealousy. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything in the OP to suggest she was bragging or rubbing it in her face otherwise.", "If they break up it won't be a thought experiment anymore.\n\nDollars to donuts if someone in the family makes a fuss or the boss themselves doesn't feel the need to keep son's ex on the payroll especially if it was a bitter breakup then guess who's getting axed.", "It usually depends on the field, lol. Cheating is an integrity issue, which can have that promotion nulled even if it wasn't nepotism; just keep the break up part.\n\nI was brought onto a company my fianc\u00e9e's dad & his best friend started. It was sorta in the same field I was already in, but while working with him I was grilled A LOT.\nI was even pulled from the schedule once because they believed my performance was slacking. After that, I've received a few noteworthy praises - I was always reminded to sharpen up, as the company & opportunities are growing.", "Pretty simple to understand imo no details needed. Cousin got mad because OP was getting hot air blown up their ass while they who has similar accomplishments didn't because OP got a promotion she perceives as undeserved and earned through nepotism.", "Come to think I\u2019ve left several comments here already and I haven\u2019t made a decision. The OG comment thread hit the nail on the head, I feel. The post had subtle tones of insecurities towards Lia than a plain AITA question.", "Meh\u2026 tell that to yourself. If you deserve it, you don\u2019t work at your family\u2019s"]}
