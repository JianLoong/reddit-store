That's why networking is a thing.", "It is obvious that Lia is jealous, but it is impossible to comment if she has grounds to be so. Either way, what she did was in poor taste. Best to move on.\n\nEdited: OP has provided more info.\n\n*She started working here a couple of years before me*\n\n*I also applied for that position but didn't get it, which is fine. The one I got is also very good, it's a sister company of where I'm currently working*\n\nOP, unless you are incredibly brilliant or she is amazingly bad, overlooking a long standing worker for a promotion is indeed nepotism. You cannot spin this to look good. Best to accept it. Note that you did not get the offer she got. Your offer was from a sister company which opens up another can of worms about favoritism.", "INFO: Everyone was congratulating you on your promotion. Were they also congratulating Lia on her new job?", "This is almost as good as the guy last week calling himself a hard worker after inheriting a factory from dad.", "YTA\n\nEdit: OP replied to comments and said the job offer Lia got is not the same offer she got. She and Lia both applied to that company, but OP didn't get in.\n\nThis isn't the big thing though - the other offer that OP got, but declined, is a sister company of her current workplace. No shit she got an offer from there.\n\nLet's break down what Lia said.\n\n*Lia overheard this and came at me, saying \"it's not about my options but my nepo privilege\" and how \"she got a new job too but everyone's kissing up to my ass\".*\n\nI'll talk about the second quote first. I mean, even from your description of this potluck it doesn't sound like everyone was busy congratulating you - which is great and all - but pushing her to the side. She got a new job which is a big achievement. Maybe she could've worded it better than kissing up to your ass but it doesn't sound like she's wrong.\n\nI'm not sure what the job is and maybe it isn't considered \"big\" in your family, but this doesn't mean she doesn't deserve to be celebrated like you.\n\nThis also brings me to the first thing she said about your nepo privilege. Is the job offer you got, but declined, the same job she got and accepted?\n\nIf that's the case, maybe she had to go to the other job because she didn't have the options you did (getting promoted at the current company). I'm not saying you don't work hard, but it's wrong to deny your boyfriend's dad co-owning the company has absolutely nothing to do with your position, not even a little bit.\n\nBut what makes you TA in what your said is your \"bitch\" comment. There's no reason for you to lash out at Lia and call her a bitch. Yes she might be jealous of you, but bitch isn't a response to that.", "YTA - you lack self awareness. You can call yourself a hard worker. It sounds nice, but you can\u2019t deny the situation is advantageous to you \u2026 in a nepo way. \n\nCalling someone a bitch for stating the obvious is definitely an AH move.", "YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t know if \u2018nepo privilege\u2019 is the right word, but surely the fact that you work at a company co-owned by your boyfriend\u2019s father does mean *something*. I\u2019m not saying you aren\u2019t a hard working employee, but you\u2019re definitely very safe at this job for a reason. Anyways this isn\u2019t why you are TA. YTA because there was no reason for you to call her a bitch. She had a point that everyone was paying a lot of attention to your promotion, when she herself was also doing pretty well in her career. I find nothing wrong in how she feels about that. There was no reason for you to lash out at her unhappiness because of the biased treatment she was receiving from everyone.", "YTA. She was acting jealous...but I think she has a reason to feel jealous and bitter, frankly. She has a new job and is moving out of state yet at dinner everyone was focusing on you; that sucks. You absolutely do have an advantage in the company you currently work for and, whilst I'm sure you do work hard, for her that sucks too. I don't think she's a 'bitch' for vocalising this.", "ESH. There is no need to throw it in her face. I don't think it's a big stretch to say your status as the girlfriend of the co-owners' son didn't play at least a small part in your promotion.", "She\u2019s just saying the truth and what all your coworkers think, but the way she said it was inappropriate. You really shouldn\u2019t work where you fuck op.

I too suspect that \"nepotism\" had some role in your getting hired at the company in the first place, and your promotion. Your boyfriend's father owns the company! \n2. You called her a \"bitch\" which was pretty rude. \n3. You told her to \"focus on herself instead of looking at what others have that she doesn't.\" Since what you have and she doesn't is, apparently, a boyfriend whose daddy owns a business, it's not something you should really be bragging about.", "Eh I\u2019m torn here. Most folks who benefit from nepotism claim they don\u2019t, they\u2019re just hard workers, but without knowing you both in real life it\u2019s hard to say who\u2019s the AH. You were pretty harsh but she was pretty aggressive\n\nThat being said I can sympathize with your cousin. She got a new job and is moving out of state- did anyone at this event bother to congratulate her and tell her they\u2019re proud of her, or did they spend the whole time fawning over you?", "INFO: is it typical that your accomplishments are acknowledged and celebrated more than hers?", "YTA. Not saying her exploding was okay, but she isn\u2019t wrong. You have to realize you had an advantage with it being your boyfriends father\u2019s company. I\u2019m sure you are a hard worker, but you had a step up.", "ESH\n\nShe could have left it alone even though she may not be wrong, she's leaving soon so what's the point. You didn't need to call her a bitch. \n\nHonestly, a lot depends on how you act towards her day to day and what special privileges you may get that you don't seem to think you get, but none of us can tell that from the post.\n\nBasically, if you and your boyfriend broke up, would everything be the same at work for you in terms of perks and working conditions? If not, then that IS nepotism and you're  lacking self awareness.\n\nEdit: Adding you can be both a hard worker AND benefit from nepotism. They aren't mutually exclusive concepts.", "You do have an extra advantage due to your boyfriend\u2019s family whether you want to acknowledge it or not. I\u2019d probably only boast about my promotions if I was working for strangers, not family. And I\u2019d never call someone a \u201cjealous bitch\u201d for having common sense. \n\nStill, she didn\u2019t need to come at you the way she did. Both you and your cousin seem to lack social etiquette, especially with family present. \n\nESH.", "YTA you don\u2019t deserve to be there, when you applied for jobs that your bfs dad didn\u2019t own you did not come up to par. She has every right to be mad at you", ">I'm happy I have options on what I want to do.\n\nAlthough I don't think you intended it the way she is likely to have taken it... This is what started the snipping. \n\nTo you it seems that Lia came at you out of nowhere. \n\nBut although you know both parties and see them together in public, you do not have intimate knowledge of the complex relationship between Lia and her stepmother.\n\nHER stepmom, who by all rights should have been celebrating HER achievement, was congratulating you (nothing wrong with that, in itself) on your accomplishment, and your response was to share that... actually you're even *more* accomplished, because you got this other thing similar to what Lia got. And then pointed out that you had the one thing she *didn't* have... options.\n\nAgain, I don't think you meant it as a dig at Lia. But I also don't think either of us know what other digs she'd put up with before that snippet of conversation. Knowing how complex familial relationships can be... I'm betting stepmom had already (even if unintentionally/lovingly) made a comparison.\n\nYes, Lia was obviously jealous. But what you read as a petty, jealous attack... I think most of us are reading as a hurt, jealous defense.\n\nYou do have options. And I'm sure you've earned them. I'm sure Lia has *also* earned them. But she does not have them. \n\nAnd if even a tiny fraction of the decision was made because of your relationship to the boss, that *is* \"nepo privilege\".\n\nIt's not an insult/attack, in Lia's eyes, but a statement of fact.\n\nCould she have phrased the \"kissing up\" part better? Maybe... but it wasn't an attack on you anyway. It was an attack on *other people's* behavior.\n\nYou said you'd \"had enough\"... but you list this as the inciting incident and say \"she seemed fine\" before that. \n\nThis wasn't a \"last straw\" situation... it was the first straw.\n\nMeanwhile, she probably *had* \"had enough\" of being ignored and passed over at a family event where, though you'd both achieved something, everyone was ... \"kissing your ass\".\n\nThe courteous thing to do, would have been to say, \"Hey that job you got was amazing! I'm not sure why no one is celebrating BOTH things.\" Or ... yknow... just walk away. Or even say, \"I don't think it's nepotism, because I do work hard.\"\n\nInstead you attacked her. And not in some \"was it or wasn't it?\" sort of way. \n\nYou resorted to name-calling, and told her to *focus on herself*, which is what she was *trying* to do in the first place.\n\nYour friend is right. You should apologize to Lia. What you said was way wrong.\n\nShe could have behaved *better*. But she wasn't trying to hurt you, she was trying to right a wrong.\n\nYou set out to wound.

There really is not doubt here and you're very ignorant about it.\n\nYes, she is jealous but calling her a bitch when she's just saying the truth (a bit vulgar though), does not warrant said treatment. Also, you should reflect on what you said and realize that you have privilege she doesn't and you should be aware of that instead of saying that she should work on herself. I don't know which one of you is more competent but you clearly have more connections that will get you a lot further than she might in your field.\n\nPlus, your family sucks. Your nepotism is as clear as day, but your family seems to be as ignorant as you and nobody seems to congratulate her for her new job that's taking her to another state (further away from family and she won't be able to attend get togethers as often, I assume). So, you're obviously the favorite compared to her.\n\nLastly, I was actually pondering whether or not Lia is also an ass, but I'm going with not because I don't believe this was an isolated incident.

Do not kid yourself there. Your boyfriend's dad has extra incentive to keep you happy, and if you were starting to explore elsewhere, then yeah, really convenient timing on that promotion. It keeps you working for bf's dad, in the same area, and bf happy. \n\nThat said, that doesn't mean you aren't a good worker, as promoting you if you weren't would be stupid. You just may have had a slightly easier time to prove yourself a good worker and have a better opportunity to keep doing so.\n\nThe flip side is your cousin may have felt pushed out because she realized you may always be given the nod over her. If she wants to advance, you are actually a road block, so she may have felt like she was forced to go elsewhere. I can't say whether or not that feeling would have merit or not, but the situation does make it plausible it's not wrong. She still gets an AH vote because that's not your fault and you'd be stupid to shoot yourself in the foot in case it is true. And it may not even be. You get an AH vote for not recognizing this and being oblivious to possible nepotism.

It\u2019s not like she was out here screaming \u201cI\u2019m better than Lia, look at my new car my promotion got me!\u201d.", "Other people congratulating OP doesn\u2019t justify Lia being an asshole to her.", "No, the sister company was the out-of-state job offer OP got, which they didn't take. And besides, how is it OPs fault if people were only focused on her and not also her step-cousin... we don't know what the roles are for new job/OPs promotion. Maybe OPs promotion is a higher tier job? Either way, how is it on her what her family members do?", "Yeah, when they applied for the same position at a company where non of them has any romantic partner, friend or family connection, then it was Lia who got the job.

Once a phrase is uttered from a celebrities lips it's all over lol.", "Lia literally lashed out first", "See\u2026 this kind of thing irks me. Because it downplays or casts doubt on those who DO work hard but never see a promotion. \n\nVery few people get promoted on hard work alone. It\u2019s not to say they didn\u2019t work hard, but it\u2019s disingenuous to suggest they didn\u2019t also benefit from timing, luck, or even personal connections. \n\nYou work hard so you\u2019re hopefully prepared to take advantage of the opportunities that come your way - but not everyone gets the same range of opportunities.", "i think the point here is that hard work does not ALWAYS equal a promotion. that\u2019s why they worded it as \u201cthe necessary outcome\u201d", "I was the #1 globally in my position at a tech firm, and during a promotion interview I was asked \"you're a loud an aggressive woman. How would you work with men?\" and suprise! I didn't get the job, but the guy who was ranked like 5 below me did. So no, just being the hardest worker aint it.", "Thank you for saying it, every promotion I was given was due to hard work, learning new skills, and being faster than my peers.", "Only way?  No.\n\nCommon way?  Yup.\n\nLots of people get promoted who didn't earn it and lots of people who worked hard didn't get promote.  The idea that there is a 1:1 relationship to either is simplistic.

You have no idea what the dynamics are there.", "How do you know she's ubiased?", "It\u2019s a fair assumption", "OP literally says in a comment she told Lia she could talk to her boyfriend about Lia getting the next promotion. That is the definition of nepotism. Lia said no and that she didn't need OP's \"help\".\n\nLia started working at this company *two years* before OP. OP still got the promotion. Now it could be that Lia is a bad worker. But Lia got a job offer out of state that OP also applied for, but didn't get. The other job offer OP got is the sister company of her current workplace, meaning that company also has ties to her boyfriend and his dad.\n\nSo the job offers OP has are all tied to her boyfriend's dad's company.

They do. When they're basically doing the job of the next tier for two years, they finally get to that tier (jr to mid, mid to sr,sr to lead, lead to mid-lead, mid lead - sr lead...etc), for like an extra 1k-3k per year. To get MEANINGFUL promotions, job hopping, networking, and nepotism are your bet, listed in order of least to best perks. Of course she's happy where she's at lol. OP's an AH for wilful ignorance. Not like everyone in that company isn't thinking the same thing.", "See... this kind of thing irks me. Because it implies that skilled workers don't have agency and can't put themselves into higher positions through better self promotion or jumping to other companies. While your statement that hard work alone doesn't get people promoted is true on the face of it, you can get yourself promoted by making sure the higher ups are aware of your hard work. I have no built in advantages at my company: no prior connections, no white privilege (admittedly I do have male privilege), etc, but I've still had four promotions in 8 years because I made sure that the people that mattered knew what I was contributing. In the other point my former colleague in that same timeframe but through the continuous company hopping route has had 6 promotions. I mean if you work hard in a forest and there is no one to hear you, did you work hard?\n\nIf you want to have a separate discussion about how unskilled workers are treated with promotional opportunities and about an invisible racial/gender/etc wall (my company has an all white exec board so no chance of me ever joining that if I stay longer term) then I think I'd be inclined to agree with you there but I don't think you can conflate those with promotional opportunities at lower levels for skilled workers.", "Yeah that's not true everyone in my field is promoted due to hard work\n Some people who work hard are working hard due to themselves, taking 8 hours to do a job that a smarter person would only take 4 hours on, see that hard work won't get you promoted.", ">\tLots of people get promoted who didn\u2019t earn it and lots of people who worked hard didn\u2019t get promote.

It could be the boyfriend's dad has nothing to do with this other company, but it's kind of sus that the other offer she got is from a sister company.

So either her boyfriend's family owns that one too, or he's pretty close with the people who do", "It fits with their preconceived idea of the world.", "Lia just got a job as an engineer for the FBI, I doubt that she's an entitled slacker.  You don't get that level of job by slacking off.  OP just got an offer from a \"sister\" company.", "An entitled slacker who managed to get her jobs without hopping into bed with the boss's son....", "Not really, especially if the requirements are listed internally as a job description", "Read the post, it says she got an offer there but turned it down.", "I did not see that comment. Thank you for pointing it out\n\nI would also add though a sister company doesn't automatically mean nepotism, at least without knowing what that company does or what their requirements are\n\nThe sister company of my last job was an entirely different type of business, with their own process and procedures. Most people didn't know they were sister companies", "> Lia started working at this company two years before OP. OP still got the promotion. Now it could be that Lia is a bad worker.\n\nNo matter how hard everyone works, there are only few promotions spots. Presumably,  Lia and OP are not the only two employees working there. Only very limited amount of these people gets promotion and that does not mean everybody else is bad worker.\n\nAnd also, promotions are not giving for hard work. You can not be lazy, but there are multiple other legitimate variables - for example whether you seem suitable for that other position. No every skilled hard worker is suitable for management for example. And then, obviously, likes, dislikes, familiarity etc play the role.", "It is TOTALLY an accusation. You know absolutely nothing about this person's situation, what education was involved, any internship, how far she got BEFORE she started dating the owner's son, how hard she works or how good she is at her job. Perhaps the owner is completely hands-off with the company. Perhaps she applied just like everyone else, was put through a vigorous selection process, and was found to be the best candidate for the role based ENTIRELY on all her hard work, dedication, and skill without any nepotism playing any role here. You are just making assumptions with NO facts to back them up. Why not give her the benefit of the doubt? Does nepotism exist? ABSOLUTELY. Did it factor in here? We have NO idea.", "Horseshit. I've seen this mostly be lobbed at women\n\nIt is far more tolerated for men than it is for women.

She's an engineer at the FBI.", "And people who don't get what they want are more likely to put it on some u earned aspect rather themselves.\n\nI can hardly believe you never heard X person say Y person only got job because Z reason.\n\nOne of the strangest ones I ever witnessed was a black lady complaining that another black lady got a promotion over her cause she was blacker.\n\nNo Becky she got it cause she can literally do every job in here and you call off twice a month and she doesn't.", "And even then, sometimes the boss's kid (or his new gf) will still get promoted over you.", "Did you read that OP was offered the other job too?", "It\u2019s not about the job requirements. It\u2019s about the internal knowledge that isn\u2019t in the job spec. I\u2019ve been on plenty of recruitment panels and the people who do the best are the ones who have inside knowledge of the role and the hiring process. Even two people in the same team will have different levels of knowledge but being able to capitalise on the knowledge of the owner (what their strategy is, the wider ins and outs that are often unknown until you get to a certain level) puts you at an advantage.", "Comment straight out of r/RomanticAdvice", "I think it\u2019s very telling that of all the thousands of companies she could be working for it is the company that her boyfriends dad owns.

Of course I\u2019ve seen people who are mad about others getting opportunities over them all the time. That\u2019s why I would not give a judgement to OP without some kind of outside perspective.", "Not necessarily. Candidates gunning for management positions generally are aware of the requirements, and in my experience, undergo multiple rounds of interviews with different hiring managers. \n\nIf the company is small, I think your argument stands. However if it's a larger one, they'll have a hiring team independent of the owners wishes", "Yea...when it's actual nepotism. We have very spurious evidence this was actual nepotism.

I'm generally a more people person, she's quiet and shy. I've told her I can talk to my boyfriend and if she keeps her work up she can probably get the next promotion. I've tried to help her.
