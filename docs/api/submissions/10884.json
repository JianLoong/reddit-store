Whilst she was buying it she said to me \"I'm going to get this, and you're going to have to put sunscreen on my back when I wear it.\" I made it very clear that I was not comfortable with that, and that I was not going to do it.\n\nA couple of months after that, we went to a water park with some other family members. She wore this swimsuit, and asked me to put sunscreen on her back. Again, I said that I am not comfortable doing that. She made a big point of speaking loudly to everyone around about how selfish and entitled I am. I just ignored her and left.\n\nRecently, we went on a holiday, just us and another family member, G.

I set this boundary every day of this holiday.\n\nOn the last day, we were going to another swimming pool, but G at the last minute said that she didn't want to go. As soon as this was said, M put on a big fat smirk and said to me, \"while we're out, you're going to have to put sunscreen on my back every half hour or so.\" The only reason I agreed to go out in the first place was because G was going, and there was no way I was going to force myself to touch M every half hour. I just said that I would rather not go.\n\nShe started going off on a big rant about how ungrateful I am, and how I should respect her more, and how entitled and selfish I am. She was supposed to be helping to pay for my University (which she isn't), so she began saying that maybe she shouldn't help pay if I'm going to be such a brat. I went into the other room so that I could ignore her, but she kept ranting about me to G. It seemed like she wanted me to hear her, because as soon as I got into the other room, she started speaking louder. I could even hear her through my headphones and music.\n\nEventually I snapped. I got so sick of the insults, and I went out into the other room and told her that it's disgusting behaviour, especially from an adult, to repeatedly insult me, a teen, for saying no to her, especially when it's something that I've repeatedly made clear that I'm not ok with doing. Then she started saying that I was rude for yelling, and started telling me how crazy I am.\n\nEver since that trip, I have not spoken to her, and I don't intend to. I've been asked by others to talk to her because \"she misses me\", and that she \"wants an apology\".

CALL THE POLICE!", "this person is pushing your boundaries. this is a red flag. make it clear to your family that you don\u2019t feel comfortable with how this person is treating you and that you won\u2019t go on any trips with them. NTA, get away from this person.", "NTA \n\nI agree that it\u2019s definitely a control thing because you are exercising your own autonomy and enforcing your boundaries which shows her that you are your own person, completely separate from her and that probably makes her feel anxious/unsafe. \n\nThat\u2019s not your problem though. \n\nYour only responsibility is to continue to enforce your boundary, which you are doing an EXCELLENT job of right now. Seriously, the fact that you remained calm for so long and firmly communicated your boundary each day shows your inner strength. You\u2019re doing everything right, keep it up.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with these toxic, controlling, narcissistic traits within your mother. I have experienced similar issues and the book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents was really soothing as it helped gives names to many of the dynamics I was experiencing with my parents.\n\nGood on you for putting some distance between your mom\u2019s house and uni btw :)", "apparently you still have to rub spray on sunscreen in", "As someone who has a emotionally immature and controlling parent who likes to maintain this perfect image of themselves to others - this would definitely work lol. I know my mom would never ask me to apply sunscreen to her again if I embarrassed her like that.", "As to why, I see a few options.\n\n1. M genuinely believes that it is a problem for OP that they don't want to touch people, and is trying to help, by getting them used to it in a therapeutic, \"see, that wasn't so bad\" sort of way.  (From what OP has said, this seems unlikely to me, but it is technically a possibility.)\n2. It is a power play.  M enjoys forcing OP to do something they don't want to do.\n3. It's a \"camel's nose\" sort of situation.  Once OP puts sunscreen on her back, M will ask them to put it other places...", "\ud83e\udd70", "honestly i'm kinda scared of how she'd respond if i said that, especially in front of someone else", "Id recommend a book called adult children of emotionally immature parents. Unfortunately, you'll probably learn a lot about her and yourself, but it helped me tremendously.", "It's a power move. OP is a college age adult now and Mom can't force them into doing anything she says, so she tries to engineer ways to force OP to do things that show she is still in charge. It's not about making OP touch her because she wants OP to touch her. It's about making OP do things she tells them to. The No-Touch boundary happens to be the one boundary OP has been most successful at maintaining and that's exactly why their mother seems so hellbent on violating it. If she gets OP to cave, she \"wins\" and it proves her superiority.\n\nNTA, OP.", "M is getting off on it.", "Tell her to buy a rash guard.  No more need for sunscreen.   \n\n\nThat\u2019s what I had my kids wear from a young age.  So much easier.", "Oh yikes. I replied 'okay predator' to someone who told me they can and will touch me if they want to after I asked them to not get up in my personal space. They really do not like it when you call their shit out. It's *really* interesting how she jumped straight to SA though,", "a lot of people have recommended me this book. i'm saving up :)", "Can we please stop this crap that men touch teens in inappropriate ways but not women?

That is a great way to get really oddly shaped burns", "If you\u2019re careful about the coverage, it works just fine without rubbing it in.", "I have read the bottle.lol, and I do rub it, although I prefer lotion anyways. Funny you commented that because I was going to also include that you are still supposed to rub it in, but opted not to since I have never burned when I just quickly reapply using it without patting. And figured if you force someone to help you apply sunscreen the spray probably provides the same or better coverage than someone who doesn\u2019t want to touch you.", "Jfc. You do realize that rape and sexual assault is about exerting power over someone who the perpetrator views as weak and vulnerable? I meant that it doesnt neccesarily have to do with sexual attraction. I'm fucking well aware women can be just as creepy as men. I'm not discounting male sexual assault be it an adult or teen. Men and boys can absolutely be assaulted by women.", "They never said anything about it only being man. Maybe you\u2019re responding to the wrong comment.", "Tbh the issue isn't the sunscreen, it's the manipulation. If you get the spray, there will be some reason why you still need to rub it on.

Gross", "NTA- in this day and age there\u2019s no need to put sun cream on someone\u2019s back, they come in aerosol forms now so they can do it themselves. And if not, they should\u2019ve brought a spatula to do their back themselves", "Nope. NTA. If she really cared about your touch aversion in a way that was about concern for you, she'd be offering to pay for therapy, not trying to force you to do something that that makes you uncomfortable, especially while smirking and being manipulative, let alone ranting about you like that. She is simply disrespecting you.", "NTA.  M has serious control issues.  When she calls you entitled and selfish, she is actually describing herself.  If she doesn\u2019t want to respect your boundaries and harasses you, then it is better to not have a relationship with her, if possible.   You do not owe her an apology.  She owes you one.    \n\n\nThere is no point in arguing with someone like this or trying to defend yourself.  These people love drama and creating misery, as you may have noticed.

It's called bodily autonomy. Please don't apologize and do not feel like this is your fault. Nobody has the right to force physical contact on you.", "NTA. But, uh. You could have asked her to just get some spray on sunscreen.", "So she pays for a weekend of fun and probably your room and board and you object to putting on sunscreen.
