Most people will ask if they want to touch me, and if I say no, they won't. This family member, M, can't respect any boundaries I set without a fuss.\n\nA few months ago, M bought a swimsuit that didn't cover her back. Whilst she was buying it she said to me \"I'm going to get this, and you're going to have to put sunscreen on my back when I wear it.\" I made it very clear that I was not comfortable with that, and that I was not going to do it.\n\nA couple of months after that, we went to a water park with some other family members. She wore this swimsuit, and asked me to put sunscreen on her back. Again, I said that I am not comfortable doing that. She made a big point of speaking loudly to everyone around about how selfish and entitled I am. I just ignored her and left.\n\nRecently, we went on a holiday, just us and another family member, G. We repeatedly went to the swimming pool on this holiday, and often M asked me to put sunscreen on her back. I always said no, because I am not comfortable touching people. I set this boundary every day of this holiday.\n\nOn the last day, we were going to another swimming pool, but G at the last minute said that she didn't want to go. As soon as this was said, M put on a big fat smirk and said to me, \"while we're out, you're going to have to put sunscreen on my back every half hour or so.\" The only reason I agreed to go out in the first place was because G was going, and there was no way I was going to force myself to touch M every half hour. I just said that I would rather not go.\n\nShe started going off on a big rant about how ungrateful I am, and how I should respect her more, and how entitled and selfish I am. She was supposed to be helping to pay for my University (which she isn't), so she began saying that maybe she shouldn't help pay if I'm going to be such a brat. I went into the other room so that I could ignore her, but she kept ranting about me to G. It seemed like she wanted me to hear her, because as soon as I got into the other room, she started speaking louder. I could even hear her through my headphones and music.\n\nEventually I snapped. I got so sick of the insults, and I went out into the other room and told her that it's disgusting behaviour, especially from an adult, to repeatedly insult me, a teen, for saying no to her, especially when it's something that I've repeatedly made clear that I'm not ok with doing. Then she started saying that I was rude for yelling, and started telling me how crazy I am.\n\nEver since that trip, I have not spoken to her, and I don't intend to. I've been asked by others to talk to her because \"she misses me\", and that she \"wants an apology\". This is far from the first time she's done something like this.\n\nIs there another side to this story that I'm just not seeing?", "created_utc": 1677347159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bqwli/aita_for_refusing_to_put_sunscreen_on_my_family/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Teenagers, for the most part,  are not really comfortable touching the body of their parents. It\u2019s a natural and normal part of the maturation process for them to feel this way. And even if this was an unusual reaction for a teenager to have about touching their parent, why would any loving parent try to force something on their kid that makes them this uncomfortable? This woman is bullying her child in a really creepy sexual way. I hope OP has someone in his life who can run interference for him with her.\n\nEdit: NTA (obviously)", "NTA. Ew", "NTA.  You've repeatedly declined her demands to do something that makes you uncomfortable.  Tell these \"others\" to talk to her and to put sunscreen on her back if they wish; but you're through with her inconsiderate behaviors.", "DO NOT APOLOGIZE!!!! EVER!!! Put your foot down and ride it out.", "NTA! do not apologize, you are allowed to refuse physical contact of ANY kind! she honestly sounds incredibly weird and antagonistic....", " There\u2019s no other way to say it,she has been deliberately and aggressively HARRASSING you. NTA and I would seriously consider not going on holidays with her ever again.", "NTa\n\n>\"she misses me\"\n\n\"I don't miss her. In fact its been nicer lately, couldn't quite put my finger on why until now.\"\n\n>entitled\n\n\"You are the one who is acting entitled thinking you have the right to demand I do things to you. No means no. If you ever bring this topic up again it will be the end of our relationship, including disagreeing with me immediately after I stop speaking, right now.\"", "NTA. I assume that M is your mother and that you are a teen. This is VERY inappropriate and toxic behavior by her. This also is a big red flag of her committing covert incest.", "NTA seems you set your boundaries well\nbefore hand and they couldn\u2019t respect them", "NTA.  You set a boundary and she violated it.  Also, she could use spray on sun screen.", "So NTA. She is, after telling her and telling her you are uncomfortable about touching people she continually made remarks about you will HAVE to put sunscreen on her back. No you do not have to speak to her and SHE owes the apoligy to you. Side note... in Health and Beauty Aisle is a Lotion Dispenser to put lotion on your own back.", "NTA.  You've made your boundary clear.  M can ask all they want, but they have to accept when you say no.", "NTA. You told her very clearly, back when sure was buying the swimsuit, that you would not agree to put sunscreen on her back. She bought it anyway, but now berates you for sticking to the boundary you already set. Threatening to pull your education funding because you consistently maintained a clearly stated boundary is especially low.\n\nI think you should have nothing more to do with her. Don't spend time with people who ignore your boundaries. Her behaviour is deeply troubling and she is not an emotionally safe person for you to be around. I'm sorry you had to go though all this, and apparently have dealt with similar behaviour from her in the past.", "NTA. There's no other side to this story that you're not seeing. M is a gigantic creep who is obsessed with making you touch her. This is not normal family member behavior.\n\nYou don't owe her an apology. If she misses you then it's her own fault. She repeatedly tried to violate your boundaries, you had enough, and now she's upset because she can no longer torment you.\n\nHave you told anyone else about this? Your parents, if she isn't your parent? I'd hope that most people would agree that her behavior is unacceptable.\n\nDid she get sunburned? If she didn't then that's a pity.", "NTA. You've been more patient than I would have been and you're maintaining your boundaries firmly. Well done.", "NTA and WTF is wrong with M?! You've said no which in itself is a complete sentence, there is other people around who are capable of applying sun screen to her back... Why has she not asked them", "NTA", "I know it\u2019s not the point of this post, but while it is certainly *easier* to have someone else apply sunscreen to your back, it\u2019s not impossible for *most* people to do it themselves with even a slight amount of effort. \n\nNTA", "Buy her the spray on sun screen but you do not ever need to touch someone you don\u2019t want to touch. Accept-ions include pushing some one out of way if speeding car or helping choking person. Sunscreen on your own. Good for you.", "NTA. Wtf is wrong with her? Why is she so obsessed with getting you to touch her back?\n>\nAnd where were the other adults when she was behaving this way?? Why didn\u2019t anyone put her in her place??", "NTA. That's freaking creepy that she makes it a point to make you uncomfortable and then make it look like you are TA.", "NTA- I feel like she could just buy the spray sunscreen and she could have you spray it on. Problem solved?", "yes.", "you have assumed correctly. and this comment made me laugh because she got offended that i was \"accusing her of sa\" (which i wasn't) but i had to remove that from my post lol", "Yes, she is my parent.

Ewwwww. \nNTA", "I certainly hope you plan to get out of there asap, would it be bold of me to presume that this is part of a broader pattern of behaviour from her?", "Yup. There you go. Stand your ground and keep her far away.", "it's definitely a pattern. multiple times i have stopped talking to her for a few weeks, even months. based on how many nta responses i've gotten, i don't think i should go crawling back this time."]}
