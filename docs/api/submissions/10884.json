Whilst she was buying it she said to me \"I'm going to get this, and you're going to have to put sunscreen on my back when I wear it.\" I made it very clear that I was not comfortable with that, and that I was not going to do it.\n\nA couple of months after that, we went to a water park with some other family members. She wore this swimsuit, and asked me to put sunscreen on her back. Again, I said that I am not comfortable doing that. She made a big point of speaking loudly to everyone around about how selfish and entitled I am. I just ignored her and left.\n\nRecently, we went on a holiday, just us and another family member, G. We repeatedly went to the swimming pool on this holiday, and often M asked me to put sunscreen on her back. I always said no, because I am not comfortable touching people. I set this boundary every day of this holiday.\n\nOn the last day, we were going to another swimming pool, but G at the last minute said that she didn't want to go. As soon as this was said, M put on a big fat smirk and said to me, \"while we're out, you're going to have to put sunscreen on my back every half hour or so.\" The only reason I agreed to go out in the first place was because G was going, and there was no way I was going to force myself to touch M every half hour. I just said that I would rather not go.\n\nShe started going off on a big rant about how ungrateful I am, and how I should respect her more, and how entitled and selfish I am. She was supposed to be helping to pay for my University (which she isn't), so she began saying that maybe she shouldn't help pay if I'm going to be such a brat. I went into the other room so that I could ignore her, but she kept ranting about me to G. It seemed like she wanted me to hear her, because as soon as I got into the other room, she started speaking louder. I could even hear her through my headphones and music.\n\nEventually I snapped. I got so sick of the insults, and I went out into the other room and told her that it's disgusting behaviour, especially from an adult, to repeatedly insult me, a teen, for saying no to her, especially when it's something that I've repeatedly made clear that I'm not ok with doing. Then she started saying that I was rude for yelling, and started telling me how crazy I am.\n\nEver since that trip, I have not spoken to her, and I don't intend to. I've been asked by others to talk to her because \"she misses me\", and that she \"wants an apology\".
