Most people will ask if they want to touch me, and if I say no, they won't. This family member, M, can't respect any boundaries I set without a fuss.\n\nA few months ago, M bought a swimsuit that didn't cover her back. Whilst she was buying it she said to me \"I'm going to get this, and you're going to have to put sunscreen on my back when I wear it.\" I made it very clear that I was not comfortable with that, and that I was not going to do it.\n\nA couple of months after that, we went to a water park with some other family members. She wore this swimsuit, and asked me to put sunscreen on her back. Again, I said that I am not comfortable doing that. She made a big point of speaking loudly to everyone around about how selfish and entitled I am. I just ignored her and left.\n\nRecently, we went on a holiday, just us and another family member, G. We repeatedly went to the swimming pool on this holiday, and often M asked me to put sunscreen on her back. I always said no, because I am not comfortable touching people. I set this boundary every day of this holiday.\n\nOn the last day, we were going to another swimming pool, but G at the last minute said that she didn't want to go. As soon as this was said, M put on a big fat smirk and said to me, \"while we're out, you're going to have to put sunscreen on my back every half hour or so.\" The only reason I agreed to go out in the first place was because G was going, and there was no way I was going to force myself to touch M every half hour. I just said that I would rather not go.\n\nShe started going off on a big rant about how ungrateful I am, and how I should respect her more, and how entitled and selfish I am. She was supposed to be helping to pay for my University (which she isn't), so she began saying that maybe she shouldn't help pay if I'm going to be such a brat. I went into the other room so that I could ignore her, but she kept ranting about me to G. It seemed like she wanted me to hear her, because as soon as I got into the other room, she started speaking louder. I could even hear her through my headphones and music.\n\nEventually I snapped. I got so sick of the insults, and I went out into the other room and told her that it's disgusting behaviour, especially from an adult, to repeatedly insult me, a teen, for saying no to her, especially when it's something that I've repeatedly made clear that I'm not ok with doing. Then she started saying that I was rude for yelling, and started telling me how crazy I am.\n\nEver since that trip, I have not spoken to her, and I don't intend to. I've been asked by others to talk to her because \"she misses me\", and that she \"wants an apology\". This is far from the first time she's done something like this.\n\nIs there another side to this story that I'm just not seeing?", "created_utc": 1677347159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bqwli/aita_for_refusing_to_put_sunscreen_on_my_family/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Teenagers, for the most part,  are not really comfortable touching the body of their parents. It\u2019s a natural and normal part of the maturation process for them to feel this way. And even if this was an unusual reaction for a teenager to have about touching their parent, why would any loving parent try to force something on their kid that makes them this uncomfortable? This woman is bullying her child in a really creepy sexual way. I hope OP has someone in his life who can run interference for him with her.\n\nEdit: NTA (obviously)", "NTA. Ew", "NTA.

You set a boundary and she violated it.  Also, she could use spray on sun screen.", "So NTA. She is, after telling her and telling her you are uncomfortable about touching people she continually made remarks about you will HAVE to put sunscreen on her back.

Don't spend time with people who ignore your boundaries. Her behaviour is deeply troubling and she is not an emotionally safe person for you to be around. I'm sorry you had to go though all this, and apparently have dealt with similar behaviour from her in the past.", "NTA. There's no other side to this story that you're not seeing. M is a gigantic creep who is obsessed with making you touch her. This is not normal family member behavior.\n\nYou don't owe her an apology. If she misses you then it's her own fault. She repeatedly tried to violate your boundaries, you had enough, and now she's upset because she can no longer torment you.\n\nHave you told anyone else about this?

Especially since pushing the spouse would also be wrong.", ">a teen whose mother refuses to recognize her repeated requests for body autonomy\n\nI agree with this but I don't see how this is pushing her into an adult role, i.e. covert incest, and you also couldn't explain it so far. I see the problem of OP, but you're throwing around terms that don't fit the situation.\n\nBtw, I forwarded the thread to my cousin who works for CPS, and she also doesn't understand where you see indications for covert incest.
