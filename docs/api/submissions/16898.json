I think you are going overboard here. You say you plan on doing this for three more years. Yes he gets social interaction at school but there is far more to it than seeing ppl on breaks. The therapist understands but does say you are too harsh. Which means that while its not a problem right now, it will soon be a problem. \n\nAlso\u2026 from this post it sounds like you are doing more to punish him than teach him or even understand why this happened. Because most kids don\u2019t do this.

You're robbing him of learning moments and putting it off for LITERAL YEARS. And for what? Because you're angry.\n\nHe's still a kid. Your kid.

You should be providing a safe space for your son.  He is a whole child, locking him up without addressing the root cause is punishing the child for parental neglect.  You should have never put him in that position.  You are the adult.  He needs to know HE can trust YOU.  If the therapist thinks you're being harsh, that's enough of an answer right there.

If his therapist doesn't think what you're doing is proportional or helpful, then I don't understand why you won't stop.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like *you* (and your wife) need therapy to deal with the trauma of that incident. \n\nI fear that continuing to monitor/isolate him like this will only eventually lead to more acting out on his part.

Sit on his lap, stuff like that, bordering on inappropriate. We saw nothing inappropriate, ourselves; he was a nice guy, and I think he didn't see the danger in it, or even perceive there was a danger. We never saw him say or do anything questionable. \n\nMy mom, however, was leery of the whole thing wary of the girl's behavior. I don't know what led the girl to do it, but at one point she accused the FF of sexual misconduct. FF spoke to a lawyer and -- in what I think was not great advice -- was advised to plead guilty and take a short(er) jail sentence, even though he didn't do it. So he spent something like six months in jail. I think the girl knew, even at that age, how to work the system.
