Well I had to leave on a family emergency for 3 days and this was a weekend so he would be left alone for Fri, Sat, Sun. He doesn\u2019t work weekends so I assumed he would at least keep the place the same as I left it. When I came back Sunday night the apartment was a mess, he didn\u2019t do my or his laundry even though I had reminded him of doing that by text several times and there was 20ish empty beer bottles on the coffee table. His dog hadn\u2019t been walked evidence but him running around acting hyper (I normally walk his dog since I go on a morning jog every morning) and I was disgusted. We had a big fight and he defended himself by saying why should he do my laundry. When I pointed out I had done his laundry for months he said I volunteered and he never asked me to. Ok then I refused to do more than my share and just washed my dishes, cooked for myself etc. \n\nHe got more and more resentful I wasn\u2019t helping him pointing out his messes and saying things like, on my mom wouldn\u2019t have let things get like this. I just ignore him and once the lease ends in 3 months I\u2019m moving back with my friend to be roommates again. \n\nLast week he got a cold and had a bit of a cough and watery eyes. Nothing serious but he yelled for me to bring him water and said I had to do his laundry because he was sick. He\u2019s not nearly sick enough to not do anything and I told him he was fine and can put the laundry in the wash and press a few buttons. He started yelling that I don\u2019t care about him and I was heartless and I\u2019m now sleeping in the other room because I don\u2019t want to deal with him anymore.

You're not his maid and you should split things equally.\n\nIf you don't work YTA. It's unfair that he has to contribute more than half of the household responsibilities.\n\nHe is also TA for not looking after the dog and doing nothing while you were away.
