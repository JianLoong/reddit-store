I was excited for them and started to ask questions but got the vibe they didn\u2019t want to talk about it so let it go. I figured I\u2019d ask about the trip when they got back. \n\nI found out last week from my sister that her and my other brothers were invited. She was surprised as well that they didn\u2019t at least invite us. She wasn\u2019t able to go either because of work. \n\nI\u2019ve been processing it a lot this week and at first felt like I should just let it go. I didn\u2019t say anything right away because my parents are VERY reactive and the type to go no contact over a simple questions such as that.  I try so hard to stay in good graces, mostly for the sake of my kids so that they have grandparents in their life (they are very good to my kids).\n\n With that being said, the past few days it\u2019s been really eating at me and I\u2019m feeling worse and worse about the whole situation. Hence, the feeling I should skip thanksgiving all together even though we rsvp\u2019d we would be there.", "***but got the vibe they didn\u2019t want to talk about it so let it go***\n\nThis sounds like they had no intention of you going at all tbh.  Which is why you weren't invited.  But you should maybe ask.  It's the only way you'll know for sure and it sounds like you need to for your own piece of mind.\n\nNTA.  The frame of mind you are in means you probably shouldn't go.  Just have fun with your own family for Gobble Gobble Day.\n\nedited."]}
