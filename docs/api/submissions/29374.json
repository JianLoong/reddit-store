Second, you didn't have a problem with Ivy not liking food, but suddenly you had a problem with Cora not liking food.\n\nYou are indeed showing favoritism.", "YTA\n\nYou are showing favoritism. You literally asked Cora if something was wrong with the food. You asked and she answered. So why are you getting upset when YOU ASKED? Also if Ivy is from a different culture, why aren't you asking your brother what foods the kids like so you can avoid this? \n\nI'm not saying you had to buy them burgers at all, but it's funny you're making these arguments that can be used for both of the girls.", "YTA. Cora literally said she didn't like what you cooked either, and was also too polite to say anything. Cora even tried to eat it despite not enjoying it.

How was what they said  any different? Neither was into the other food and both preferred burgers,", "YTA, both nieces didn't like the food but you only bought a replacement for one, that's favoritism.", "OP wrote in answer to someone- Ivy likes trying new food. Usually it is not a problem and she eats what we make. \u2014 this right here makes you an AH and shows you play favorites. If this is true then Ivy just didn\u2019t like your food- same as Cora except you\u2019d bend over backwards to get ivy an expensive burger but not Cora.", "I mean, YTA and I'm sort of put off by having to explain it to you.", "YTA a bit here. You are in fact showing favoritism. There was nothing impolite about Cora's request, since she knew you were already getting one burger from there. Cora also doesn't much like the food and didn't say anything until you asked.", "YTA.   \n\n\nSo one \"isnt used to it\" (aka doesn't like it) so she gets a burger ... but the other one doesn't like it, but not as much, so she has to eat the food she doesn't like?", ">She asked why I did it for Ivy then and I told her that Ivy isn't used to our food and she is polite enough to not say anything when she doesn't like the food.\n\nWhat a nothingburger of a hill to die on.

Cora was at least trying to be polite by choking down the food you didn't bother to ask guest preferences on until you dropped the pretense and offered up a burger to Ivy.

Otherwise if she lives in the same country then she's used to the food, and you offering to get it for one but not the other is an AH move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
