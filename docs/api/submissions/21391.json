My sister (29F) has been living with them for the last 4-5 months, because her husband is divorcing her and she isn't allowed to be near their children(2x5M) for now.\n\nMy sister fell for an American scam called \"young living\" that sells essential oils and in 8 months she spent around 12500 euro, all their saving, on buying inventory that she was supposed to sell. She hid it in their appartments basement where they never usually go. BIL had to repair one of the kids bikes so he went there to get his tolls and found the boxes.\n\nBIL confronted my sister and to her credit she admited to everything, including to secretly mixing the oils in their food. BIL threw her out and filed for divorce. There was an emergency hearing, because he wasn't allowing her to be alone with the kids, in which the judge decided that my sister is a danger to the kids (BIL showed record of the insane claims the company makes about their products) and she will only be allowed visitation when she sees a psychiatrist.\n\nShe has refused to go and is fighting the order. BIL still allows us to see the kid and I even babysat them a couple of times when I didn't have exams and was still in the capital.\n\nMy sister and BIL both work as engineers and are well paid, the kids are in kindergarden, my sister mostly morks from home.\n\nSince I moved here last month my sister had been a nightmare, the only things she does is scream, cry or complain, but she doesn't listen to advise, she has changed 3 lawyer. I finished my nightshift at the hotel bar/club and was home by 7 a.m. My parent had already gone to work and my sister was in the living room drinking coffee. As soon as she saw me she started complaining how unfair her life is. I just wanted to eat breakfast and go to bed and she wouldn't even let me go to the kitchen.\n\nAfter the 4th minute I couldn't take it and shouted the title at her (the worse than a kid comment is because after googling the anme of the company I found problem with it in minutes) and that she is luck BIL didn't make facebook posts or contact her job(she works with classified information) to get her fired.\n\nShe started crying and locked herself in her room. She is still crying and she throwing her stuffed animals(the only thing that is left in her room) at the wall to my room. Also she is late for work since her laptop and phone(it hasn't stopped ringing for 30 minutes) are on the living room table. So AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the all the advise.My parents came home finally and are currently fighting with my sister after I told them what has been going on. Dad gave me the car keys so I can sleep in it since I won't be able to sleep in the house for some time and I have a morning shift tommorow.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the comments. To answer some:\n\n1.The kids are fine. Their only symptom was diarrhea and minor stomachache. BIL had them take a lot of test, there was no damage to their livers and the only concern was with their stomachs, they had some sort of wart-like things in it.( I don\u2019t know what it was exactly and I\u2019m not planning to ask BIL for details.) But it cleared up with time and medication, without the need to operate them.\n\n2.My sister was never like this before, although she is really competitive. She was first in high school and has won math and physics competitions. She was accepted in the best technical university of our country. When she was 3rd during her university graduation she threw some tantrums, but we thought that it was because she was getting married and worrying for what master\u2019s degree to apply for.\n\n3.My sister isn\u2019t religious and I don\u2019t know why she joined the MLM. The only thing that she has told us is that she thought that she could make a lot of money fast, and that she had people that would have bought all her inventory in a couple of months.\n\n4.She has an amazing salary 3000 euro a month (for our country that means 6000 in our currency). 2020/21 was great for her, she was promoted because many people were let go for allowing hacker attacks and she has to work only 6 hours a day from home.\n\n5.She used 17 kinds of oils in her and BIL\u2019s cooking, because she thought that they were harmless, but more than half of them weren\u2019t safe for human consumption according to Young Livings labels.(her defense was that the labels were just for show and they were actually safe) She would have gotten visitation, but when the psychiatrist was recommended my sister got mad and apparently said something like \u201dthis is what happens when a country allows illiterate people to become lawyers \u201d(technically true) and you see the outcome.\n\n6.I shouldn\u2019t have stayed home after she started throwing stuff at her wall, I could have gone to our neighbor and slept there, she is a nice lady and has been like family for year, but honestly I wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\n\n7.I slept in the car because there was a lot of screaming and I had to rest. Also I could never spend half my paycheck, to sleep for a night, in the hotel I work at.\n\n8.We have tried talking to her calmly, but it does not work.\n\nAfter my nap in the car I talked with dad, he was waiting for me. I will apologize to my sister tomorrow after I finish with work, because I shouldn\u2019t have shouted at her. During the weekend we will repair the lock to my door (it\u2019s been broken for years, but I never had a reason to use it). From tomorrow my sister will be working from dad\u2019s office, he is a notary, so he can keep an eye on her. She wasn\u2019t too happy but dad got mad and told her that she isn\u2019t too old to receive her first spanking at 29. I barely stopped myself from laughing. As for her work, mom is calling her GP to write a note she sprained her ankle and that she was in the hospital, so all my sister has to do apologize to her boss for not contacting him. She was also warned that if she behaves like this again, she will be living with our aunt. Mom apparently told my sister that she was disappointed with her and that she failed as a mother if her kid acts like this when she\u2019s 29. Sister was crushed, because she respects mom a lot, she stopped going to school at 14 to start working in a factory to support the family and now she is a department head in a clothing factory. But she still refuses to see a psychiatrist.", "created_utc": 1688548472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14r5bw2/aita_for_calling_my_sister_an_idiot_worse_than_a/", "score": 1636, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like...at all. People might brush this off as a mistake on her part, but willfully hiding things is a clear sign of knowing that someone will take offense to the thing you're hiding. She wasted thousands of euros of family assets on her get rich girl boss strategy, and to add insult to injury she was effectively poisoning her family as many essential oils are not fit for human consumption.\n\nYour sister is clearly self-destructing as a person, but again I can't find it in me to sympathize when it's clear she is easily defrauded and will gladly conceal potentially life threatening actions from her family.

Tell her that you aren't available to discuss these issues unless she starts the conversation by taking accountability for the actions she has taken that led to this result. She doesn't have to feel it's fair or that she's the only one at fault, but she must acknowledge that she's an adult who made choices and had a role in the situation. Tell her that until she able to do that, you will not participate in conversations on this topic and you will leave the room if she tries to discuss it with you. Then leave the room every single time she brings it up, sometimes ask \"are you ready to acknowledge that you contributed to this situation yet?\" before you leave to remind her what is required for you to engage. \n\nThat's probably the single most helpful thing you can do for her. Remind her that she has agency and that she contributed to this situation. That also means she can contribute to resolving it if she chooses. \n\nThe next thing you can do is speak with your parents about setting house rules regarding respectful behaviour. Rules like limiting noise when you're trying to sleep after night shift, like not obstructing free movement of others in the home (which, BTW, is domestic violence), no yelling, etc. If they are not on board with setting and enforcing those reasonable boundaries then you will get nowhere with your sister and need to settle in for a few months of unpleasantness unless you decide to stay elsewhere. \n\nIf they're on board, whole house meeting where the new rules are laid out along with the consequences for breaking them. Everyone must agree to adhere to the rules even if they don't agree with the rules themselves. Then get your parents to enforce them when she breaks them. \n\nShe's in a mindset that the world is unfair and she's a victim with no agency. Both you and your parents can assist her to break out of that by requiring her to control her own behaviour while engaging with you, or face the consequences she has been explicitly made aware of. \n\nThat may help her to recognise that she can change the way things go down in her life by reflecting on her own behaviour, which opens the door to therapy being helpful. \n\nYou could also look into the research on deprogramming/deconditioning cult members, I believe there's some solid research on the most effective approach. Not that you should attempt it yourselves, but it might help you to understand what's required and they will have suggestions on what families can do to help their loved ones progress in that direction. \n\nWishing you the best, this is a crappy situation all around", "> When I was a journalist we wrote against many MLMs(in Asia). They are ALL scams.\n\nThis is true and it's also true that person who is scammed bears part of the responsibility. Usually scams exploit some sort of flaw (greed, narcissism, arrogance, lust, etc).
