Now many commenters will say you are ta for shouting but I'm working on the assumption that you've tried talking to her about it and got nonsensical dream world answers back mixed with a healthy dose of im the victim.

You are entitled to eat your food and go to bed after a night of work and it sounds like your sister really needs to get help. She is going trough a lot.

Not only is she messing up her life, but she\u2019s also screwing up her kids.  For what?  A scam.\n\nHonestly she hasn\u2019t hit rock bottom yet.  She needs to hit it before she can put her life back together, and the only way to get her there is to contact her job.", "NTA\n\nJust curious, what country do you live in? Sounds great for a judge to understand how ridiculous and predatory MLMs can be.", ">BIL confronted my sister and to her credit she admited to everything, including to secretly mixing the oils in their food.

There was an emergency hearing, because he wasn't allowing her to be alone with the kids, in which the judge decided that my sister is a danger to the kids (BIL showed record of the insane claims the company makes about their products) and she will only be allowed visitation when she sees a psychiatrist.\n\nI really can't sympathize here. Like...at all. People might brush this off as a mistake on her part, but willfully hiding things is a clear sign of knowing that someone will take offense to the thing you're hiding. She wasted thousands of euros of family assets on her get rich girl boss strategy, and to add insult to injury she was effectively poisoning her family as many essential oils are not fit for human consumption.\n\nYour sister is clearly self-destructing as a person, but again I can't find it in me to sympathize when it's clear she is easily defrauded and will gladly conceal potentially life threatening actions from her family. It makes her judgement and her intent seem suspect. Someone needed to tell her all her, \"my life is unfair\" shit is both bullshit and immature.\n\nNTA", "NTA, move in with BIL", "NTA she\u2019s unhinged at this point", "I'm actually kind of shocked that falling for an MLM is enough to lose contact with her kids. I know they are the cause of many divorces in the US, but losing custody rights is a whole other level. NTA for being frustrated with her.", "Bulgaria. I think it's mostly because the essential oils in their food. I don't think we have a lot of MLM's, from what I saw AVON is the only popular one in Bulgaria that i have heard of and I didn't know it was a scam", "He lives in the capital and that is 7 hour by train away from my summer job and the rest of the time i prefer the dorms since they are cheaper", "The judgy wants her to go, she hasn't been to a psychiatrist yet. How are we suposed to help?", "You just had to go fishing to find excuses in order to make the sister more sympathetic even though she's literally causing all of her own problems...Just to trot out the old tired \"But she's Family~\" as your advice. Smh.", "It actually does as the sister continues to be an Asshole to herself and others.\n\nA tired family member coming back from work without rest or food is not the person that should be expected to provide sympathy to a divorce caused by her own willful mistakes and ongoing inability to recognize that fact.", "When I was a journalist we wrote against many MLMs(in Asia). They are ALL scams.\n\nI do have a little sympathy for people who are poor and fall for these because when you are desperate to pay for your kid's wheelchair, you'll believe anything. I'm not saying it's right, but for MANY people- this is the case.\n\nBut your sister is well-educated and has a well-paying job. AND she was mixing cats know what into her kids' food? What was she even thinking?\n\nIt's understandable that she's is a bad place RN but it's her own doing and she doesn't get a free pass to take it out on you.\n\nNTA. I hope she goes to the psychiatrist because she clearly needs it.\n\nAlso, people who get sucked into MLMs keep repeating the cycles. Watch out for that.", "Both. You can be mad at someone for being so dumb they've deluded themselves into a MLM, and pity them for how much they have willingly fucked themselves over with it.", "Do you have headphones? Use them. NTA", "I guess she lost visitation not because she fell for the MLM but because she mixed unsave and potentially dangerous substances in her kids food secretly. I guess that would've been deemed as alarming in the US, too.", "It's more about the essential oils in the family's food and refusing to follow the judge's orders, according to the 1st and 2nd lawyer, than the falling for a scam.", "It is indeed awful that she was secretly adding things to their food like that.\n\nLike, oils in cooking is normal, but not when the intent is twisted like this.", "There are many there... I have family friends who whip out a projector at every party and try to rope everyone into a different scam every time. It's disappointing to see people fall for it. \n\nSorry, chovek - big time NTA.", "I don't know about Bulgaria, but in Hungary Avon is pretty harmless.", "Firstly, NTA.\n\nTo answer your question about how you can help, the first thing to do is set clear boundaries. Tell her that you aren't available to discuss these issues unless she starts the conversation by taking accountability for the actions she has taken that led to this result. She doesn't have to feel it's fair or that she's the only one at fault, but she must acknowledge that she's an adult who made choices and had a role in the situation. Tell her that until she able to do that, you will not participate in conversations on this topic and you will leave the room if she tries to discuss it with you. Then leave the room every single time she brings it up, sometimes ask \"are you ready to acknowledge that you contributed to this situation yet?\" before you leave to remind her what is required for you to engage. \n\nThat's probably the single most helpful thing you can do for her. Remind her that she has agency and that she contributed to this situation. That also means she can contribute to resolving it if she chooses. \n\nThe next thing you can do is speak with your parents about setting house rules regarding respectful behaviour. Rules like limiting noise when you're trying to sleep after night shift, like not obstructing free movement of others in the home (which, BTW, is domestic violence), no yelling, etc. If they are not on board with setting and enforcing those reasonable boundaries then you will get nowhere with your sister and need to settle in for a few months of unpleasantness unless you decide to stay elsewhere. \n\nIf they're on board, whole house meeting where the new rules are laid out along with the consequences for breaking them. Everyone must agree to adhere to the rules even if they don't agree with the rules themselves. Then get your parents to enforce them when she breaks them. \n\nShe's in a mindset that the world is unfair and she's a victim with no agency. Both you and your parents can assist her to break out of that by requiring her to control her own behaviour while engaging with you, or face the consequences she has been explicitly made aware of. \n\nThat may help her to recognise that she can change the way things go down in her life by reflecting on her own behaviour, which opens the door to therapy being helpful. \n\nYou could also look into the research on deprogramming/deconditioning cult members, I believe there's some solid research on the most effective approach. Not that you should attempt it yourselves, but it might help you to understand what's required and they will have suggestions on what families can do to help their loved ones progress in that direction. \n\nWishing you the best, this is a crappy situation all around", "> When I was a journalist we wrote against many MLMs(in Asia). They are ALL scams.\n\nThis is true and it's also true that person who is scammed bears part of the responsibility. Usually scams exploit some sort of flaw (greed, narcissism, arrogance, lust, etc). You have to want to be scammed to be vulnerable to them.", "There  is no point, she checks up on me every 30 minutes to say that I am insensitive for trying to sleep when she is hurting, yet she still hasn't started working. I'm waiting for our parents to come home to deal with her.", "Has the 3rd lawyer been able to get your sister to listen to their counsel?\n\nOr is it a matter of time before they get sent packing and she continues to disobey the judge's orders?", "Essential oils should NEVER be ingested", "thanks I'll talk with my parents, but I looked cult deprogramming for my country and I only found translated foreign articles so I'm not sure if it'll, but thanks anyway", "Get a spray bottle, fill it with water, and squirt her in the face every time she wakes you up.", "She told my sister that the judge was sexist and a woman-traitor? and is trying to get her changed", "It's not your responsibility to do that work anyway, so if it doesn't pan out that's OK. Set your boundaries, get your parents on board to support you in that at a minimum, and let her do what she's gonna do as long as it doesn't impede on your wellbeing. The rest is ideal actions but not your responsibility to do. All the best"]}
