Tell her that you aren't available to discuss these issues unless she starts the conversation by taking accountability for the actions she has taken that led to this result. She doesn't have to feel it's fair or that she's the only one at fault, but she must acknowledge that she's an adult who made choices and had a role in the situation. Tell her that until she able to do that, you will not participate in conversations on this topic and you will leave the room if she tries to discuss it with you. Then leave the room every single time she brings it up, sometimes ask \"are you ready to acknowledge that you contributed to this situation yet?\" before you leave to remind her what is required for you to engage. \n\nThat's probably the single most helpful thing you can do for her. Remind her that she has agency and that she contributed to this situation. That also means she can contribute to resolving it if she chooses. \n\nThe next thing you can do is speak with your parents about setting house rules regarding respectful behaviour. Rules like limiting noise when you're trying to sleep after night shift, like not obstructing free movement of others in the home (which, BTW, is domestic violence), no yelling, etc. If they are not on board with setting and enforcing those reasonable boundaries then you will get nowhere with your sister and need to settle in for a few months of unpleasantness unless you decide to stay elsewhere. \n\nIf they're on board, whole house meeting where the new rules are laid out along with the consequences for breaking them. Everyone must agree to adhere to the rules even if they don't agree with the rules themselves. Then get your parents to enforce them when she breaks them. \n\nShe's in a mindset that the world is unfair and she's a victim with no agency. Both you and your parents can assist her to break out of that by requiring her to control her own behaviour while engaging with you, or face the consequences she has been explicitly made aware of. \n\nThat may help her to recognise that she can change the way things go down in her life by reflecting on her own behaviour, which opens the door to therapy being helpful. \n\nYou could also look into the research on deprogramming/deconditioning cult members, I believe there's some solid research on the most effective approach. Not that you should attempt it yourselves, but it might help you to understand what's required and they will have suggestions on what families can do to help their loved ones progress in that direction. \n\nWishing you the best, this is a crappy situation all around", "> When I was a journalist we wrote against many MLMs(in Asia). They are ALL scams.\n\nThis is true and it's also true that person who is scammed bears part of the responsibility. Usually scams exploit some sort of flaw (greed, narcissism, arrogance, lust, etc). You have to want to be scammed to be vulnerable to them.", "There  is no point, she checks up on me every 30 minutes to say that I am insensitive for trying to sleep when she is hurting, yet she still hasn't started working.

I\u2019ve been around essential oils a lot because of my older sister and mom, so I\u2019ve looked at the labels so many times over the years. Totally agree, even the most heady, wook type of people I know that use essential oils won\u2019t put them inside their bodies/consume them. It\u2019d probably be healthier to drink an entire vial of liquid L than internally consume most essential oils (kidding).", "You eat them all the time most likely.\n\nHow do you think they naturally flavor breath mints, candy, gum and flavored teas?\n\nEssential oils.", "Many MLMs focus on \"health\" and \"wellness\". Usually they prey on a mixture of \"get rich quick\" fantasy and general desperation for a solution to a genuine health issue. A lot of time, especially in the US at least... Those two overlap, as dealing with a chronic and/or poorly understood disease is expensive.", "Nah that's dangerous thinking. Anyone can fall for a scam or a cult. They prey on vulnerable people and anyone can be vulnerable.", "I guess she lost visitation not because she fell for the MLM but because she mixed unsave and potentially dangerous substances in her kids food secretly.", "The point where she can\u2019t even see her kids. Not only is she messing up her life.", "It\u2019s appropriate but rare. So many outright maliciously abusive parents get to still have access to kids. \n\nHell, when I was a kid I had an abusive dad who straight up kidnapped me and still got unsupervised visitation. I have a sister who\u2019s fighting to keep her kids from their criminal father (who was convicted of violent crimes). Courts like to give parents access to kids.", "Most bottles I\u2019ve seen of different brands of essential oils say not to ingest them!!! Like they can be really harmful", "Of course they can be ingested. Some shouldn't. \n\nBut essential oils are used to flavor Altiods mints, Earl Grey Tea, classic gums like Beeman thst uses clove oil, candies using fennel/licorice,  mint, cinnamon, citrus... the list is quite long.\n\nAny time you see \"natural flavorings\" it is likely an essential oil.", "2.8 billion in sales is nothing to laugh at.\n\nAMWAY is 8.4B.", "Yeah, I have a few essential oils (I like the smell. And some legit are good for things like general mosquito or fly control) but they're not food! They're either diffused (with all mammals out of the house, so the oils have settled by the time we come back) or just spritzed on whatever the target object is.\n\nEdit: I just looked at all the ones I have. Various house brands from supermarkets mostly. They all say not to consume.", "There's a difference in culinary grade products, as well as the concentration of the oil. Essential oils are distilled, nominally pure oils. Very different from the diluted, and often slightly different form, found in food naturally. \n\nConcentration is what kills. There's a safe dose of pure hydrogen cyanide or of pure arsenic (both just VERY VERY VERY low) and there's a fatally toxic dose of water (literally called water intoxication, and very hard to accidentally consume that much).", "Has the 3rd lawyer been able to get your sister to listen to their counsel.", "We all have flaws and weaknesses. It's best to be honest of what they are so we don't fall for scams that we are vulnerable to. But not everyone is vulnerable to every scam because we don't have the same flaws.", "Bonus points if the water has some essential oils mixed in \ud83d\udca6", "OOOOOOF.\n\nGood luck OP.", "TO A JUDGE?    \n\nI'm surprised she isn't a dude ... the balls on her \ud83d\ude32", "my experience is that the judge gave the parent every opportunity to comply--completely ignoring the well-being of the child. Only when the parent violated every rule, and a member of the public reported the parent's skeezy behavior, did the judge block the parent from the child.", "Food grade essential oils are made the same way as essential oils, but in a food safe environment.  It is still an essential oil.\n\nIt is WHAT not the HOW that makes the difference.", "U sir or madam are both genius and petty I applaud you \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4c", "Jalape\u00f1o oil. For the burn.", "Oh man! You are evil! Love it! Take my fake gold \ud83e\udd47", "You broke the internet with this", "The lawyer told the sister that appearently. Not her to the judge", "No need! \u00c0 la Betty White, \n\u201cWhy do people say, \u2018Grow some b4lls\"? B4lls are weak and sensitive.\n\nIf you really wanna get tough, grow a v4gin4. Those things really take a pounding!\u201d", "Oh phew. Glad I misread that one", "This isn't TikTok. You can just say balls and vagina."]}
