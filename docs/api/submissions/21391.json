She needs a huge reality check. Now many commenters will say you are ta for shouting but I'm working on the assumption that you've tried talking to her about it and got nonsensical dream world answers back mixed with a healthy dose of im the victim. It is ok to be frustrated with this behaviour. I would apologise for losing your sh*t but follow up with as calm a conversation about this as you can both manage. \n\nWatching a loved one self destruct is hard.", "NTA, she is indeed a dumbass. Not much more to it.", "You should check out r/antiMLM.\nThese institutions run a lot like cults and it\u2019s hard to understand how insidious they are until you learn about them. \nThey completely destroy families and I can bet you and your sister and the rest of your family are not the first victims of  this company", "Neither is. You are entitled to eat your food and go to bed after a night of work and it sounds like your sister really needs to get help. She is going trough a lot. Basically she needed help when she was married but instead of getting help she got a divorce and lost het kids. So yeah she is going trough a lot, still does not give her permission to act like she is doing but will give her some credit for the entire situation.", "Weird comments here. In my old ass opinion YTA. You can exert boundaries with out insults.  Just say \u201cI\u2019m exhausted and not available.\u201d  Your sister is likely doing real dumb ass shit.  But that doesn\u2019t give you unilateral rights to insult her bc you\u2019re annoyed.", "ESH (Everyone sucks here)\n\nShe\u2019s a fool for falling for a MLM, but those things are _designed_ to prey on people and are ran like cults. She\u2019s a victim in that regard and as the psychiatrist says she needs help.\n\nBlaming her then for her own mental problems is also bad, but she needs the wake up call.\n\nShe\u2019s hit rock bottom, and she\u2019s your sister, put annoyance aside and help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
