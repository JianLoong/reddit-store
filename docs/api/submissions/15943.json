She showed me a pic of the sock and it was clearly very old sock the colour was faded, it looked a bit dusty and it wasn't worn out she not recently worn. I told her it was probably an old sock of an ex that he long forgotten about. After a few days she talked about it with Bob and it turned it was indeed a very old sock of an ex.

I told Denise you either accept Bob for how he is or you break up with him instead of having the same fights with him constantly.

I tried to explain myself and said that I meant i care about her wellbeing and having these fights isn't good for her mental health.\n\nWell a bit later she again was venting because Jenny mentioned she needs to trust her gut feeling.

I said since it was dusty it was probably from when Bob was dating the ex. Denise and Jenny discuss about how it's just weird about why he would lie about that and just doesn't tell the truth. Here is why i might be the asshole, I said: \"he probably lied because he didn't want another fight just like about the sock, I would had done the same thing.\n\nDenise stopped walking went up my face very upset and asked if I was on his sight.

Denise sounds *exhausting*. \n\nShe's in her 30s and Bob is in his late-20s. The likelihood of this being either of their first relationships is very low. To *not eat* because you're reminded of this is extremely dramatic.\n\nMy partner and I have been together for going on eight years. Occasionally, we come across something that belonged to one of our exes that got thrown in a box somewhere and accidentally moved with us. We both even have something an ex gave us that we hold onto not as a reminder of the ex but because we simply like the thing. Just because I'm wearing an old sweatshirt \"I forgot to give back\" doesn't mean I have feelings for anyone in my past and knowing I have these things with zero feelings I can be confident my partner isn't holding onto feelings either just because they like a figurine an ex gave them.\n\nThere are people walking around who have a face of an ex tattooed on their body and she has to break out the wine and Ben & Jerry's over an old sock? Honestly, she just really sounds like a drama queen. Kinda feel bad for Bob.", "NTA. Denise is the one with a problem. This \"I thought you were this pure and innocent soul but apparently not\" is a laugh and a half. It's not even a compliment. It's like she thought you were some kind of a cuddly critter, but you disappointed her by turning out to be a human adult with a functional attention span, intelligent insights based on information she provides, and an ability to articulate them. How terrible for her!", "NTA, dump the friend, she is mentally unstable.", "NTA. Your friend seems to love drama and the attention it gets her, and she is indeed teaching her bf to lie due to her unreasonable behaviour.", "NTA. She sounds like the least mature of your trio while being the oldest. Why is she finding old dusty things at his place all the time? So weird. I wouldn't want her around.", "NTA. Denise has some personal stuff to work through. You may have been a bit brusque in your opinion of the brochure incident, but that's it.", "NTA it is unrealistic to think that when we break up with someone we purge our lives completely of every trace of the ex. No, he should not have lied but she sounds crazy so I get it too. If I were him that behavior would be a deal breaker.", "NTA Denise is picking fights and is a huge crybaby, especially at 31. I\u2019d find better friends.", "NTA. Why are you friends with her?", "NTA I had a friend similar to her just a bundle of issues and every time I tried helping she just came up with more issues. Shits fucking exhausting man. I feel way better not being friends with them. Fuck that noise they hit me up not too long ago and I was the driest mofo you\u2019ve ever seen.", "NTA - this sounds exhausting and incredibly unhealthy.", "NTA, your friend sounds like a lot\u2026", "NTA but all I\u2019m imagining is your friend acting like that scene from Monster\u2019s Inc with the sock. \u201cWe have a 23-19!!!\u201d Seriously though, the behavior she\u2019s exhibiting is not healthy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
