For example a little while ago she was doing the laundry at her bf's place(Bob, 27). She found an old pink sock which caused her a bit of distress. She showed me a pic of the sock and it was clearly very old sock the colour was faded, it looked a bit dusty and it wasn't worn out she not recently worn. I told her it was probably an old sock of an ex that he long forgotten about. After a few days she talked about it with Bob and it turned it was indeed a very old sock of an ex. Situations like that kept happening in which she became very upset, cried and didn't even eat for days. I would be her shoulder to cry on and giving her advice.\n\nWell so when we were hanging out she was again venting about her relationship. I told Denise you either accept Bob for how he is or you break up with him instead of having the same fights with him constantly. Denise was very shocked when I said this and she asked if i think if i think she's picking fights. I tried to explain myself and said that I meant i care about her wellbeing and having these fights isn't good for her mental health.\n\nWell a bit later she again was venting because Jenny mentioned she needs to trust her gut feeling. Denise talk about how yesterday while cleaning Bob's place she found a dusty old pile of business flyers. The owner of the business has the same name as the ex of Bob. Denise asked him what those flyers were. Bob seemed to be taken of guard and said those were of his sister's business and the name on the flyers was her second name. I said since it was dusty it was probably from when Bob was dating the ex. Denise and Jenny discuss about how it's just weird about why he would lie about that and just doesn't tell the truth. Here is why i might be the asshole, I said: \"he probably lied because he didn't want another fight just like about the sock, I would had done the same thing.\n\nDenise stopped walking went up my face very upset and asked if I was on his sight. I was taken very off guard and said no I just try to put myself in his shoes to understand the situation. She looked me in the eyes and said she was very disappointed and she said how she thought I was this pure and innocent soul but apparently im not that.\n\nDenise was very upset and kept tearing up a bit and iced me out. Jenny tried to help me out by saying she understood where I was coming from and we all just have different mindsets. Eventually after a while Denise gave me a hug and said she didn't wanted to be mad at me.

Denise sounds *exhausting*. \n\nShe's in her 30s and Bob is in his late-20s. The likelihood of this being either of their first relationships is very low. To *not eat* because you're reminded of this is extremely dramatic.\n\nMy partner and I have been together for going on eight years. Occasionally, we come across something that belonged to one of our exes that got thrown in a box somewhere and accidentally moved with us. We both even have something an ex gave us that we hold onto not as a reminder of the ex but because we simply like the thing. Just because I'm wearing an old sweatshirt \"I forgot to give back\" doesn't mean I have feelings for anyone in my past and knowing I have these things with zero feelings I can be confident my partner isn't holding onto feelings either just because they like a figurine an ex gave them.\n\nThere are people walking around who have a face of an ex tattooed on their body and she has to break out the wine and Ben & Jerry's over an old sock? Honestly, she just really sounds like a drama queen. Kinda feel bad for Bob.", "NTA. Denise is the one with a problem. This \"I thought you were this pure and innocent soul but apparently not\" is a laugh and a half. It's not even a compliment. It's like she thought you were some kind of a cuddly critter, but you disappointed her by turning out to be a human adult with a functional attention span, intelligent insights based on information she provides, and an ability to articulate them. How terrible for her!", "NTA, dump the friend, she is mentally unstable.", "NTA. Your friend seems to love drama and the attention it gets her, and she is indeed teaching her bf to lie due to her unreasonable behaviour.", "NTA. She sounds like the least mature of your trio while being the oldest. Why is she finding old dusty things at his place all the time? So weird. I wouldn't want her around.", "NTA. Denise has some personal stuff to work through. You may have been a bit brusque in your opinion of the brochure incident, but that's it.", "NTA it is unrealistic to think that when we break up with someone we purge our lives completely of every trace of the ex. No, he should not have lied but she sounds crazy so I get it too. If I were him that behavior would be a deal breaker.", "NTA Denise is picking fights and is a huge crybaby, especially at 31. I\u2019d find better friends.", "NTA. Why are you friends with her?", "NTA I had a friend similar to her just a bundle of issues and every time I tried helping she just came up with more issues. Shits fucking exhausting man. I feel way better not being friends with them. Fuck that noise they hit me up not too long ago and I was the driest mofo you\u2019ve ever seen.", "NTA - this sounds exhausting and incredibly unhealthy.", "NTA, your friend sounds like a lot\u2026", "NTA but all I\u2019m imagining is your friend acting like that scene from Monster\u2019s Inc with the sock. \u201cWe have a 23-19!!!\u201d Seriously though, the behavior she\u2019s exhibiting is not healthy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good grief this girl thrives on drama!!", "Honestly it sounds like she's looking for things to get upset about and then looking to you and Jenny to validate the drama. She doesn't seem to want advice that isn't 'go nuclear omg how could he do this,' so NTA for being blunt with her, even if it's probably not the best way to do so. Honestly I'd avoid her in the future, if she wants drama in her personal life she's not going to care if it comes from her SO or 'omg how could OP side with him?? Do you think they're having an affair' or something equally absurd", "NTA. Denise is toxic. She is looking for things to explode over. I hope Bob wakes up and saves himself.\n\nYou, on the other hand, should find yourself a friend that is more balanced, someone that is actually share your values instead of attacking you for understanding that there is always another side to any story. Your empathy for the other side will never be appreciated by people like Denise. \n\nWouldn't it be nice to have a friend that you don't have to tiptoe around?", "Is he cheating on her? Or has he in the past? Why did he lie about have his ex\u2019s business flyers? Is he still hung up on his ex cause if so he shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship. I knew someone like Denise. She was in a relationship with someone that wasn\u2019t good, but whenever she vented I could tell she was either needing reassurance that it was nothing or that she just needed someone to show he was good for her and that she needed out. But idk cause I only knew one person like that.", ">Situations like that kept happening in which she became very upset, cried and didn't even eat for days.\n\nIma be real with you? When I read this bit my eyes jumped back up to the listed ages, and I was astonished to find that this woman is thirty one in spite of acting like a fifteen year old in their first serious relationship. She jumps to conclusions, gets distraught for days, and only after she's forced to it does she ask and probably with no shortage of intensity that would be off putting to anyone.\n\n>Well a bit later she again was venting because Jenny mentioned she needs to trust her gut feeling.\n\nThe problem with the gut is it isn't exactly a rational thing. It's useful for avoiding danger, but navigating interpersonal situations? A lot of the most horrifically overbearing spouses are like this because in their gut they, \"know their partners cheating,\" they just haven't found proof yet. When every little thing, a missed call, a forgotten text, a late arrival home, a text message that was actually an Uber Eats/door dash delivery confirmation, is seen as \"evidence of something\" your gut is by far your worst enemy.\n\n>Denise stopped walking went up my face very upset and asked if I was on his sight. I was taken very off guard and said no I just try to put myself in his shoes to understand the situation. She looked me in the eyes and said **she was very disappointed and she said how she thought I was this pure and innocent soul but apparently im not that.**\n\nAgain, I'm astonished she is 31. Bolded for emphasis of where her thinking became completely ridiculous.\n\nNTA, because you're trying to push her to navigate her issue in a healthy way that doesn't involve sparking conflicts and assuming the worst, but she's reading this as \"taking his side\" as if this is some sort of factional thing. She doesn't grasp that this isn't about sides, but rather about understanding each other as best we can.\n\nShe clearly needs some level of help, because this level of hypervigilance in a relationship is exhausting for all parties.", "My life I have struggled making and beholding friends. It happened so much that I don\u2019t even know anymore if the problem is me that\u2019s why I made this post. I think I\u2019ve been too blunt to Denise and that I scared her that way. This is the first time something like this happened with Denise she always been very gentle.", "Wonder if that\u2019s a part of why she has friends a decade younger, bc presumably peers would notice/call out her behavior? Something feels\u2026 off? As someone with friends of many ages, I find it strange that she seems to be crossing a lot of boundaries in her friendships with quite a bit younger people\u2026 in the sense that there is an inherent vulnerability/power dynamic imbalance that feels somewhat\u2026 intentional? On Denise\u2019s part? \n\nIn any case, Denise\u2019s \u201cinnocent & pure\u201d comment, along with her weirdly aggressive face to face eye contact when OP \u2018dared\u2019 to challenge her certainly indicate that her control issues extend beyond romantic relationships. She does not sound well, and I\u2019m concerned for the young people she relies so heavily on for affirmation and reassurance.", "I had repost with lots of things left out because of the character count. With situations like that kept happening I didn\u2019t mean she kept finding items. For example Bob doesn\u2019t mention he\u2019s in a relationship with Denise when he meets up with mutual acquaintances (old classmates they used to be in the same college class few years ago). Also he didn\u2019t want to post her on his Instagram account because apparently it\u2019s for business only but when she went through his follow list he was following OF\u2019s girls. \n\nWe talked about how exes in the past has messed her up and she talks about how she needs to learn to trust her current boyfriend. That\u2019s why she\u2019s venting about these situations because she doesn\u2019t know if either she has a right to be upset or there is nothing wrong. \n\nI had given her the advice about breaking up with him which she seem to consider but after talking with her boo everything is okay then. \n\nYeah I think you\u2019re right that she has issues and needs help which I shouldn\u2019t give her because I\u2019m too blunt. Personally I do not trust her bf but I\u2019m not the one in the relationship so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s really happening.", "Me and Denise were roommates and were able to make a connection that way. Jenny is my friend and I introduced them to each other. I do feel like Denise is a little bit not mature for her age but she always been a good friend to me, I\u2019ve cried many times on her shoulder too. This was the first time something like this happened.", "Bob may not see Denise the same way. 'Til now you have seen a certain facet of Denise. The fact that she got in your face the way she did says to me that you cannot trust her. If she thinks you are crossing her, she may attack you physically. There is no other purpose in getting in your face like that.\n\nThis is not a \"you\" problem. This is Denise. She has shown you her nasty side.\n\nShe has presented herself a certain way to you 'til she thought you might be after her man. What made her think that? Just for having empathy for him. That is kind of frightening. She definitely has a \"you are with me or against me\" vibe about her. Be careful.", "Denise and I were roommates and got to know each other that way and made a connection. Jenny is my friend and I introduced them to each other. Denise has friends her own age but they all have children so that\u2019s why she likes to hang out with me and I bring Jenny along. Me and Jenny are mature for our age because of the things and responsibilities that have been put on us from a young age. I do have to agree that Denise is a bit immature so I always felt because of that we are all on the same level."]}
