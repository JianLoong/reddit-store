He can make an effort.", "NTA for not accommodating the deadbeat dad. \n\nHowever, I'm worried about these kids getting abandoned by both parents and now getting abandoned by their aunt/uncle. Is there anyone else who is stable and can take care of them? Are they in therapy? I understand you didn't have these kids and maybe can't afford childcare, but this may feel like one more rejection to them. \n\nIf you do end up sending them, please make sure the place is reputable and that they kids can get counseling and support. And please have them visit as much as possible.", "NTA you sound like a great uncle/aunt doing what's best for them.\n\nI will chime in one more thing I don't see yet in the comments - make sure the school is 100% up-to-date on the situation and that the bio dad does _not_ have any authorization to take them off-campus, etc.", "NTA you are working things out the best you can. If dad wants to be involved he needs to go through the courts.", "NTA for trying to ensure that your nieces have a stable environment for learning and that they are safe and well taken care of.\n\nYour nieces father on the other hand, unless he has court-mandated visitation rights, is pretty much SOL.

You're doing what's best for your nieces.  If their father had wanted custody, he should have sought it out through the courts.", "NTA, but I think you should talk to the kids and see what they think. It might benefit them having the father in their life more especially without the mom in the picture as much.", "NTA\nYou don't have to facilitate visits with anybody.", "NTA. You cleared this with the custodial parent.  If you have temporary guardianship, then you can arrange for him to visit with him.  If you sister still has full custody, then he needs to work with your sister to visit with them.", "NTA\n\nYou are actually a rockstar for taking in your niblings.", "More info: how old are the kid\u2019s & have you asked for their thoughts on this?", "NTA, BUT - you can't keep doing what you're doing right now.\n\nI can't tell if the girls' dad is an okay guy who could be just trying to step up, or if he's a danger to them, but EITHER way you're probably making a mistake if you're just blowing him off because the girls are in boarding school. \n\nThis guy is their father, and even if he doesn't have custody it doesn't mean he can't GET custody, and his right to claim custody is much better than YOURS. \n\nIf he is an okay guy you should be cooperative, and maybe even reconsider boarding school - maybe this guy could be how the girls' are taken care of when you're on a business trip for example.  And certainly you should cooperate about trying to get this guy a chance to see the girls when they're back from school, and maybe even help with authorization to visit with the girls WHILE they're at school, if he's willing to make the trip.\n\nOn the other hand if this is a terrible father who should be kept away from the girls, you need to be talking to a lawyer about how to stop that from happening, and how to get you official legal rights... or at least how to avoid your sister's custody from being in danger given her issues.  \n\nEither way, don't ignore the situation.", "This is more a question for r/legaladvice.

Just because your sister has full custody does not mean they can not see the father, unless there are reasons, like he is an unsafe father.\n\nYou have enough money to send multiple kids out of state to a full time boarding school?

Even though it shouldn't be your responsibility, you're making sure that those children are safe and cared for.

If dad is so worried he can make visitation plans with the boarding school because you know they have those!\n\nEdit:also if OP has custody ( it says she does) then it doesn\u2019t matter what the father wants OP has the legal rights to make decisions without parents involvement.. and nowhere allows custody to go through to another family member and the parents still have rights to make those decisions.

A nanny working 24/7 for weeks at a time is going to be expensive as fuck, and since most good nanny\u2019s work out of an agency there are also regular work and overtime rules so it would have to be more than one nanny. \n\nBoarding school very well could be cheaper.", "That's just not how it works. You can't hire a live in nanny to raise children when you're gone for a few days at a time. You also can't just leave the kids alone at home. \n\nI'm not even going to get into the difference in the quality of education from a boarding school vs. whatever public school district OP is in or the issue of having space for two kids + a live in nanny.\n\nIf the father is not on their life and has never tried to be (ie: he didn't get custody when the kids were younger or when his ex relinquished custody) then there's probably some serious issues going on.", "was he allowed visitation rights though? also, this is a little more subjective, but i would never put a kid through boarding school unless i had no other options", "Do you have actual legal custody?

What do THEY say about this situation?", "NTA dad couldn't care enough to get involved so he doesn't get to pick and mix when he does.\n\nI will say i'm worried abouyt the girls feeling abandoned.

What he wants is no longer a factor in this equation.", "If you're out of town working so you can't care for the children, and if there are no other relatives who can care for the girls in their homes, then sending them to boarding school makes sense.  \n\nBut if the father has visited the girls regularly despite your sister having custody, and has a relationship with them, it would be much much better for them if you found a nearby boarding school where he could see them regularly.\n\nFor that matter, it would be much better for you to find a school nearby where you and their mom can see them regularly, and where it would be easy for you to bring them home to your house on weekends easily and regularly.\n\nProbably NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIgnore the deadbeat dad - he had his chance to step up for HIS kids, and failed to do that.", "NTA. May well be the best thing for the girls. Get a lawyer and tell dad to contact you through said lawyer", "NTA\n\nUnder the circumstances, boarding school is the best place for them.\n\nThe father can visit them if he wants - subject of course to whatever visitation rights he has. \n\nParents typically visit kids during the weekend or kids even go home for the weekend if they want - it's not a prison after all.", "NTA. It\u2019s what works best for most of the people involved. Is there a way dad can see them at school? Honestly beyond finding that out, I wouldn\u2019t be concerned about it since he didn\u2019t even bother to try and get custody. Dads like that get no say in situations like this. Sucks to suck.", "NTA", "NTA, there's nothing wrong with boarding school (presuming it's a quality one).", "NTA and I am glad I having seen any stereotypical \"but boarding schools are only for kids that aren't loved by their parents!\" comments. It highly depends on the boarding school (I really, really hope you did your research about that), but a good boarding school can be really beneficial for kids, especially kids that aren't used to a structured home. I hope your nieces get the support they need at their new school", "Their dad can either get custody now (which I\u02bbm guessing involves a lot of his straightening his life out) or travel to see them.\n\nNTA", "Perhaps their dad can take over then", "\"I'll take, 'Things that the dude should've thought through better' for $1000, Alex.\"   \nNTA.", "YTA. Those poor kids\u2026", "As someone who was raised in kinship care by an aunt, boarding school can be a great option. She's not abandoning them, she's making sure they get all their needs met whilst teaching them to be independent- a skill they will need with unreliable parents. She can still be there for them even if they're in boarding school. I wish I'd been put in boarding school as my aunt travelled loads and I had to go stay with random people all the time- which was so much more unstable. \n\nOP, you are doing a great job", "Yeah that was my first thought. We don't really know the circumstances, but it's more Iikely than not that Mom giving up custody of kids old enough to go to boarding school is extremely traumatic for them.\n\nThose poor kids at best are going to feel completely abandoned, at worst they're a target for abuse if the boarding school isn't well managed.", "Boarding school. That sounds like it's gonna do wonders for the kids psychological scars. It is where rich parents who don't give a fuck about their children send their kids. So other people can take care of them.", "Visits aren't forbidden at boarding schools. He can go visit them. Or he could've got custody since op's sister didn't wanted them", "This is an excellent answer. We're not privy to the details of the parents' custody arrangements. We have no idea if the father is a \"good guy,\" a \"deadbeat,\" or something else entirely. Ignoring a child's parent is almost never a good idea.", "You do realize that he could've asked for custody at any time right? Op's sister has full custody for a reason. Courts don't give a parent full custody without a good reason. Hell, people who went to jail gain visitation, and this guy didn't.", "Probably op lives in a state where there aren't good boarding schools? Or she lives in a border town and the closest boarding school was in the state neighbour. Either way, girls's mom was okay with it. And dad didn't asked for visitation in courts when they separated, so i assume he doesn't care.", ">I suspect there is more to the story as to why he didn't try to get custody.\n\nYeah, he didn't want to. Since op's sister is unavailable to watch the kids, nothing stops the guy from asking for custody.", "They state they took in the kids so they would not be taken by CPS. That is pretty clearly CPS is involved and mom was going to lose custody.", "That's a bit of the generalization. Reddit had good boarding school posts and bad boarding school posts. There's as much as a chance for the kids to like it as they can dislike it and they're individuals in individual situations. They might even be in the middle. What's important is OP listening to them about it and doing what's best for them in regards to it.", "That's ... like, not a response to what I said.\n\nThere is a risk here that the dad feels stonewalled by you and gets a lawyer and goes to court to get custody over his kids.  Does that provoke NO concern?  If so, I guess you can just let that happen and find out what kind of massive modification the court system will make to your niece's lives, but I would think you would at the very least think it over and maybe talk to your sister about it.", "Has this gone through family court? If mom is giving up custody, even temporarily, the dad has a say. Mom can't just hand over physical custody to you. And if he has visitation, she/ you can't just move the kids out of state.", "But does OP actually have legal custody or just something signed by the mom? It all depends on what the court has ordered. And dad still has rights irrespective of custody agreements. If he has visitation, OP (nor the mom) can just decide to move the kids out of state.", "We have no idea what dad did or didn't do. OP says they're the children's \"legal guardian\", which doesn't really mean anything when it comes to visitation rights. We don't know what's been ordered by the court, if the parents have a visitation agreement... there's a lot we don't know. \n\nKeeping children away from their father is an AH move, unless the father is dangerous.", "No, I don't \"realize\" that, and neither do you. We're not privy to the legal details of their custody agreement.", "Not necessarily. Mom could have simply thought CPS was going to get involved. Or the family threatened to get CPS involved if Mom didn't give up her kids. It happens.", "Litteraly not upto me to decide to work with the dad or not without custody i cant grant visitation without parent approval", "he doesn't have visitation and she isnt legally giving up custody so Im just staying out of their issues", "That is not remotely true! Again I do this for my\nJob so I know the laws. If OP has custody then OP decides what happens.  According to the post CPS was involved so that means she has some form of paperwork from the courts! So if dad wanted to be dad then he should have fought for custody and if he has visitation rights then he can do visitation at the boarding school! No court is going to say oh you have custody but have to get everyone approval to do anything. That\u2019s not how it works and especially with OPs job this is the best solution for the children to have a safe and permanent environment.", "It even says in the post that he didn't try to get custody and that he was okay with op's sister having full custody.", "I mean yes we can extrapolate greater meaning of a situation or take the words and context at face value.", "That is almost certainly false.\n\nIf you are the legal guardian of these girls, you absolutely have the ability to let them see their father.", "She's already given up custody.", "OP probably only knows what the sister told them.", "You want to take AITA at face value? \n\nK.\n\nAnyway, with what little the OP said, my statements stand. We do not know that CPS was actively involved - that CPS has/had an open case with mom. Anyone can threaten to call CPS for any reason. Whether they do and then CPS screens that call in depends wildly on the circumstances. There are any number of possible situations here.", "The thing that gives me pause id that if CPS were involved, I'm pretty sure that they would have tried the father before an uncle/aunt who has to travel for work.\n\nIt sounds like OP's job would pretty much disqualify them from consideration if it were CPS making the decision.", "Generally yes, you can make a whole narrative beyond what was actually stated if you want to, but your just making up stories beyond what is probably a made up story.", "I agree with you. If CPS had an open case, OP would not be allowed to send the kids to boarding school.", "You're also making up a story."]}
