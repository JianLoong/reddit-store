Deadbeat dad can sit and spin. If CPS didn't approach him, the bio dad, to take in the kids, you can bet your ass there is a reason.", "NTA.\n\nDad didn't fight for/gave up his rights when he declined/lost custody.  Unless a court is willing to give those back to him and he's willing to take the kids full-time during whatever's going on with your sister, he doesn't get a vote.  It's good he wants to see them, but you're going above and beyond, and can't mess up your own life over this.  The custodial parent has agreed, and you as the temporary guardian have made the arrangements.\n\nIf dad wants to he can go see them, call them, etc. but this (lack of choice) is a consequence of his own actions.  You've done nothing wrong, quite the opposite in fact.", "NTA\n\nI went to boarding school.  I don't think visits on weekends were prohibited.  He can make an effort.", "NTA for not accommodating the deadbeat dad. \n\nHowever, I'm worried about these kids getting abandoned by both parents and now getting abandoned by their aunt/uncle. Is there anyone else who is stable and can take care of them? Are they in therapy? I understand you didn't have these kids and maybe can't afford childcare, but this may feel like one more rejection to them. \n\nIf you do end up sending them, please make sure the place is reputable and that they kids can get counseling and support. And please have them visit as much as possible.", "NTA you sound like a great uncle/aunt doing what's best for them.\n\nI will chime in one more thing I don't see yet in the comments - make sure the school is 100% up-to-date on the situation and that the bio dad does _not_ have any authorization to take them off-campus, etc.", "NTA you are working things out the best you can. If dad wants to be involved he needs to go through the courts.", "NTA for trying to ensure that your nieces have a stable environment for learning and that they are safe and well taken care of.\n\nYour nieces father on the other hand, unless he has court-mandated visitation rights, is pretty much SOL. Or he can visit them at the school where they reside, or in your home on school holidays.", "NTA, you have recognised what you can realistically offer and provided stability for your nieces, this is a balanced option.", "NTA.  You're doing what's best for your nieces.  If their father had wanted custody, he should have sought it out through the courts.", "NTA, but I think you should talk to the kids and see what they think. It might benefit them having the father in their life more especially without the mom in the picture as much.", "NTA\nYou don't have to facilitate visits with anybody.", "NTA. You cleared this with the custodial parent.  If you have temporary guardianship, then you can arrange for him to visit with him.  If you sister still has full custody, then he needs to work with your sister to visit with them.", "NTA\n\nYou are actually a rockstar for taking in your niblings.", "More info: how old are the kid\u2019s & have you asked for their thoughts on this?", "NTA, BUT - you can't keep doing what you're doing right now.\n\nI can't tell if the girls' dad is an okay guy who could be just trying to step up, or if he's a danger to them, but EITHER way you're probably making a mistake if you're just blowing him off because the girls are in boarding school. \n\nThis guy is their father, and even if he doesn't have custody it doesn't mean he can't GET custody, and his right to claim custody is much better than YOURS. \n\nIf he is an okay guy you should be cooperative, and maybe even reconsider boarding school - maybe this guy could be how the girls' are taken care of when you're on a business trip for example.  And certainly you should cooperate about trying to get this guy a chance to see the girls when they're back from school, and maybe even help with authorization to visit with the girls WHILE they're at school, if he's willing to make the trip.\n\nOn the other hand if this is a terrible father who should be kept away from the girls, you need to be talking to a lawyer about how to stop that from happening, and how to get you official legal rights... or at least how to avoid your sister's custody from being in danger given her issues.  \n\nEither way, don't ignore the situation.", "This is more a question for r/legaladvice. Just because dad doesn't have custody doesn't mean he hasn't any rights at all. So, yeah, YTA for just assuming that you can do what you want with your nieces and stop them from seeing their dad.", "NTA you have to do what is best for you and the children which, right now, is boarding school. If dad wanted to be in their lives, he would be. There are probably a lot of good reasons why he isn't and none of that is your fault.", "SOFT YTA. Just because your sister has full custody does not mean they can not see the father, unless there are reasons, like he is an unsafe father.\n\nYou have enough money to send multiple kids out of state to a full time boarding school? Why can you not hire a full time nanny instead? Would that not make more sense and be cheaper? I've never had a Nanny, so I do not know, which is why I am asking.", "NTA, because you are stuck between a rock and a hard place, but those poor kids. Their mum and dad have both abandoned them, and now they are being shipped off to boarding school. They must feel like no one in the world loves and wants them.", "YTA for:\n\n* Sending the kids to boarding school without including their father in the discussion, regardless of the custody arrangement\n* Keeping the kids away from their father.  You \"can't really do that for him\"?  Bullshit.  If you have custody, you have the power to grant visitation.  Besides,,,  I suspect there is more to the story as to why he didn't try to get custody.", "Yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even though it shouldn't be your responsibility, you're making sure that those children are safe and cared for. If their father is willing and able to take custody of them, he should do it properly through the courts system, otherwise he has to defer to the person who does have custody of them currently.", "Nta. It will be at cps.", "Nah\n\nWhy send them out of state boarding school instead of somewhere local the parents can at least visit?\n\nYou are stepping up, but emotionally it may be very similar to cps.

OP has to make the best decisions for the children and not the father. If dad is so worried he can make visitation plans with the boarding school because you know they have those!\n\nEdit:also if OP has custody ( it says she does) then it doesn\u2019t matter what the father wants OP has the legal rights to make decisions without parents involvement.. and nowhere allows custody to go through to another family member and the parents still have rights to make those decisions.

A nanny working 24/7 for weeks at a time is going to be expensive as fuck, and since most good nanny\u2019s work out of an agency there are also regular work and overtime rules so it would have to be more than one nanny. \n\nBoarding school very well could be cheaper.", "That's just not how it works. You can't hire a live in nanny to raise children when you're gone for a few days at a time. You also can't just leave the kids alone at home. \n\nI'm not even going to get into the difference in the quality of education from a boarding school vs. whatever public school district OP is in or the issue of having space for two kids + a live in nanny.\n\nIf the father is not on their life and has never tried to be (ie: he didn't get custody when the kids were younger or when his ex relinquished custody) then there's probably some serious issues going on.", "was he allowed visitation rights though? also, this is a little more subjective, but i would never put a kid through boarding school unless i had no other options"]}
