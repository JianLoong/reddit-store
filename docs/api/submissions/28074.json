I wish I'd been put in boarding school as my aunt travelled loads and I had to go stay with random people all the time- which was so much more unstable. \n\nOP, you are doing a great job", "Yeah that was my first thought. We don't really know the circumstances, but it's more Iikely than not that Mom giving up custody of kids old enough to go to boarding school is extremely traumatic for them.\n\nThose poor kids at best are going to feel completely abandoned, at worst they're a target for abuse if the boarding school isn't well managed.", "Boarding school. That sounds like it's gonna do wonders for the kids psychological scars. It is where rich parents who don't give a fuck about their children send their kids.

Ignoring a child's parent is almost never a good idea.", "You do realize that he could've asked for custody at any time right? Op's sister has full custody for a reason.

Hell, people who went to jail gain visitation, and this guy didn't.", "Probably op lives in a state where there aren't good boarding schools? Or she lives in a border town and the closest boarding school was in the state neighbour. Either way, girls's mom was okay with it. And dad didn't asked for visitation in courts when they separated, so i assume he doesn't care.", ">I suspect there is more to the story as to why he didn't try to get custody.\n\nYeah, he didn't want to. Since op's sister is unavailable to watch the kids, nothing stops the guy from asking for custody.", "They state they took in the kids so they would not be taken by CPS. That is pretty clearly CPS is involved and mom was going to lose custody.", "That's a bit of the generalization. Reddit has good boarding school posts and bad boarding school posts. There's as much as a chance for the kids to like it as they can dislike it and they're individuals in individual situations. They might even be in the middle. What's important is OP listening to them about it and doing what's best for them in regards to it.", "That's ... like, not a response to what I said.\n\nThere is a risk here that the dad feels stonewalled by you and gets a lawyer and goes to court to get custody over his kids.  Does that provoke NO concern?  If so, I guess you can just let that happen and find out what kind of massive modification the court system will make to your niece's lives, but I would think you would at the very least think it over and maybe talk to your sister about it.", "Has this gone through family court? If mom is giving up custody, even temporarily, the dad has a say. Mom can't just hand over physical custody to you. And if he has visitation, she/ you can't just move the kids out of state.", "But does OP actually have legal custody or just something signed by the mom? It all depends on what the court has ordered. And dad still has rights irrespective of custody agreements. If he has visitation, OP (nor the mom) can just decide to move the kids out of state.", "We have no idea what dad did or didn't do. OP says they're the children's \"legal guardian\", which doesn't really mean anything when it comes to visitation rights. We don't know what's been ordered by the court, if the parents have a visitation agreement... there's a lot we don't know. \n\nKeeping children away from their father is an AH move, unless the father is dangerous.", "No, I don't \"realize\" that, and neither do you. We're not privy to the legal details of their custody agreement.", "Not necessarily. Mom could have simply thought CPS was going to get involved. Or the family threatened to get CPS involved if Mom didn't give up her kids. It happens.", "Litteraly not upto me to decide to work with the dad or not without custody i cant grant visitation without parent approval", "he doesn't have visitation and she isnt legally giving up custody so Im just staying out of their issues", "That is not remotely true! Again I do this for my\nJob so I know the laws. If OP has custody then OP decides what happens.  According to the post CPS was involved so that means she has some form of paperwork from the courts! So if dad wanted to be dad then he should have fought for custody and if he has visitation rights then he can do visitation at the boarding school! No court is going to say oh you have custody but have to get everyone approval to do anything. That\u2019s not how it works and especially with OPs job this is the best solution for the children to have a safe and permanent environment.", "It even says in the post that he didn't try to get custody and that he was okay with op's sister having full custody.", "I mean yes we can extrapolate greater meaning of a situation or take the words and context at face value.", "That is almost certainly false.\n\nIf you are the legal guardian of these girls, you absolutely have the ability to let them see their father.", "She's already given up custody.", "OP probably only knows what the sister told them.", "You want to take AITA at face value? \n\nK.\n\nAnyway, with what little the OP said, my statements stand. We do not know that CPS was actively involved - that CPS has/had an open case with mom. Anyone can threaten to call CPS for any reason. Whether they do and then CPS screens that call in depends wildly on the circumstances. There are any number of possible situations here.", "The thing that gives me pause id that if CPS were involved, I'm pretty sure that they would have tried the father before an uncle/aunt who has to travel for work.\n\nIt sounds like OP's job would pretty much disqualify them from consideration if it were CPS making the decision.", "Generally yes, you can make a whole narrative beyond what was actually stated if you want to, but your just making up stories beyond what is probably a made up story.", "I agree with you. If CPS had an open case, OP would not be allowed to send the kids to boarding school.", "You're also making up a story.", "I don\u2019t think we have enough information here. It seems like the dad is trying to be an active part of their life, taking then away from their dad would be inappropriate. Also, how do the girls feel about being shipped off to boarding school?", "why are the kids not with their dad in the first place? Are you sending them to an actual.school.or one of those troubled teen facilities?\n\nNot enough info", "ESH if she is surrenderinv custody to you, then a judge needs to approve the guardianship. And there  is a very low chance that a judge will give you guardianship rather than the bio father eapecially given you are refusing visitation. \n\nLetting your sister have full physical custody means nothing re parental rights and legal custody. You need to consult a family law lawyer ASAP.", "YTA on two fronts.\n\nFirst, your sister does not get to decide to give custody of her girls to you.  If she cannot take care of those kids, the first option should be their father, not an aunt/uncle with so little time to spare that they have to be shipped off to an interstate (?) boarding school.\n\nSecond, if you *are* the legal guardian of these kids, you *absolutely* have the authority to approve visitation with their father.  Your hands are not tied on this issue.  The girls are not seeing their father because you are being prevented by some legal technicality from permitting it, the girls are not seeing their father because you are *choosing* to not let him see them.  FFS, *you moved them to another state!*\n\nYou and your sister are behaving without regard for these girls wellbeing and it seems to me that your actions are (IMHO) driven by a desire to help your sister maintain full legal custody despite her being unable to discharge the responsibilities that are the basis for that custody.\n\nYou are doing so is such an incompetent manner that I actually think it's going to make the father's case stronger, so I don't propose to explain how you might do this more effectively.", "u/FaithlessnessMost944 Actually boarding school will give them structure that they weren't getting with their mom and in the long run help them educationally. That said unless their dad is a total creep then you shouldn't cut them out of their life. You didn't say how old the kids are but shutting their dad out of the lives probably isn't the best thing to do. If he really wants to be part of the lives then he should contribute towards their care like school fees.", "NTA, unfortunately they were born to parents who failed them", "NTA. You are doing enough.", "NTA if he wants to see them (assuming there\u2019s nothing shady going on with him), why didn\u2019t he try to get custody of his own kids?

If he can't take care of hos own kids he doesn't get to criticize how you do it.", "You did what is best for the kids. Since you aren\u2019t always available you\u2019ve sent them to school and you can still see them, talk to them, etc. Their mother agreed. Dad has no say as he doesn\u2019t have custody and if he can and is allowed to he can FaceTime or call or visit. \n\nNTA - you\u2019re doing the best you can do.", "Well, if CPS is competent they will basically say \"the kids aren't safe with you right now. Who would you want them to stay with?\" And the mom presumably named OP. It's not a formal removal, but it's letting them know that if they don't make a plan themselves then CPS will step in. But it gives the parent as much control and voice as possible.", "I begged my parents to send me to boarding school. No reason, happy home life, fine public school experiences.  I just really, really wanted to go away.\n\nThis was decades before the Harry Potter books, but I must have read enough books with Prefects and midnight feasts...!", "Enid Blyton right?", "I begged my parents for years because I wanted to go to boarding school I don't even know what triggered my desire to go as it was also before the Harry Potter Series was released. But man, I wanted to go to boarding school so bad.", "Gosh yes, among others!

That (and the magic) is why I wanted to go!", "I wanted to travel, I longed to go to England.\n\nAs an adult, I've been able to travel and England was not a disappointment! Just as I had dreamed, only better! Also France, Spain, Italy and other places. Fantastic!", "Just cause i have the ability to do something doesn't mean im supposed to be the one making said decisions im letting the kids mom decide if the father can visit them", "She probably knows more than you. And since she has power of attorney, it's a fact that dad didn't even had visitation.", "Username checks out :)", "Did the father have visitation when the kids lived with your sister?", "See THAT makes sense.  \n\nThing is, she should know that if she says no she's risking him looking into a lawyer and trying to get custody.  Does she understand that?  I don't think he'd be asking if he was happy not seeing them at all under the present circumstances.", "It's not that.\n\nIf CPS actually took the kids, they would not place them with an aunt/uncle who didn't have the time to care for them.  First port of call would be the father.\n\nThe girls would end up in the foster system before CPS would place them with OP."]}
