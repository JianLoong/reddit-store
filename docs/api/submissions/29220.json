He made about 10 times more money than she did. They split every meal they had on dates, concert tickets, vacations...everything. My sister thought that she was being a strong, independent woman. \n\nShe married him, and splitting the bills continued. He paid for most of the mortgage, since she could never have afforded a house in that area, but she split everything else. They lived in a high cost of living area. She went into credit card debt, and had trouble affording hair cuts. He would go on vacation without her, because she couldn't afford it. He would pay for a vacation if he wanted her to come see his family, otherwise, he would just vacation with friends or relatives. It got pretty extreme by the time they divorced. She just couldn't financially afford to stay married to him. \n\nI sincerely hope that you do not fall into the same class of man. \n\nI'm very traditional. I think it's a bad idea to move in with someone you're just dating, because it creates pressure for unsuitable people to remain together when they should have gone their separate ways. If you break up, one or both of you have to move, forced to live together until that time. I think a man should pay on dates, and for the most part, pay for vacations. This shows that he will provide for her, if they do get married. He will take care of her while she is pregnant, for example. A couple also needs to discuss if they want kids, or not, and if they do have kids, is the plan daycare, stay at home mom, part time work, or full time career with lots of overtime. They have to be aligned on values, religion, politics, what to do in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, and all sorts of issues that can lead to major disagreements. \n\nNow, you can have every right to expect your gf to show she cares.
