She was diagnosed with severe postpartum depression and psychosis ideation. Not toward the baby but toward herself. Not even sure what psychosis ideation is honestly but I'm assuming it's bad, where they have put her in to therapy 3x a week and have a visiting nurse coming by to check on her and the baby twice a week. Her therapist recommended either I take off work for the time being or I bring someone in to help her because right now she needs all the help she can get. And yes, my wife is fully onboard with help. She begged for it. She knew something was wrong and immediately went to the doctor. \n\nThe only person I could think of to help was my sister. Now, my sister is 46 and she went through the same thing (diagnosis wise) but hers was bad enough for hospitalization so she has a pretty good understanding, whereas I don't. And my boss is a prick and won't give me the time off and we desperately need the money. I didnt know where else to turn. At first my wife agreed to having my sister here, though she was a bit hesitant because my sister is on the opinionated side. But now, my wife is losing her shit on me for my sister being here at all and claiming she would rather be fully admitted to the hospital instead of dealing with it. Not because of my sister but because of my sister's dog. For whatever reason, the dog being anywhere near my wife is setting her off in ways that it usually wouldn't. I've asked my sister if she can have anyone take the dog and she doesn't. \n\nSo my wife lost it yesterday. She was making dinner (she wanted to) and the dog came in to the kitchen and sat by the fridge, which is about 6 feet away from the stove. My wife lost it. She started screaming \"get that fucking mutt out of this house or else\". Saying something to the affect of she's sick and tired of a dog always at her feet begging and staring at her, etc etc. Told my sister to get lost and that she wasn't helping her but instead making it worse due to her \"flea bag\". I told my sister to just take off for a few hours while I calmed my wife down and as soon as my sister left, it's like a flip switched. My wife was acting like nothing happened. So I told her that I needed to have my sister come back because I need to leave for work that night and she lost it again. Said if I bring my sister back here than she will leave with the baby. I'm lost here.\n\nETA: my sister refuses a doggy daycare. She says it's not an option. Her doctor and therapist are aware of the mood swings and have openly told me that the dog is a trigger and has asked me to get the dog out of the house but where my sister won't and I have no one else who can help, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. My wife has stated that the reason the dog is triggering her is because the dog is always touching her or begging for food/whining.

You are in an extremely difficult situation. Under no circumstances should your wife be allowed to leave with the baby.\n\nFor whatever reason, your sister\u2019s dog is setting off your wife\u2019s mental illness. Either the dog needs to go stay elsewhere while your sister is there, or someone else needs to come stay to support your wife. It does not need to be someone who has been through the same, just someone willing and helpful.\n\nYou need to be a little more involved with your wife\u2019s treatment and with communicating with her. You should go to a therapy session and let them know your concerns, and go to the doctor with her. You need to understand what her diagnosis is, and ask allll the questions so you know best how to support her. No excuse to say you don\u2019t really understand it. And, you need to talk to your wife about what she wants and needs. She\u2019s not in the best frame of mind right now, but make sure you make the effort.\n\nSorry you are dealing with this, stay strong.", "I had severe post partum with psychosis. She needs medical HELP ASAP. Things can go bad FAST!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe help your sister is giving is awesome but the dog is causing way to much stress on your wife and needs to go to doggy day care or something.", "The sister and the dog need to go and you need to stop going to work. Harsh, but true. No matter what your boss says, this could be a life of earth matter and your wife needs you, her husband and the father of her child. \n\nThis is not an AITA matter. Everyone is doing their best here but right now what your wife needs is medical intervention and a period of stability. That means sending your sister and her dog home. Sorry buddy - I know this isn\u2019t what you want to hear - but it\u2019s what you need to hear. \n\nAll the very best. I feel for you.", "Is it your sister or the dog? Send the dog to a kennel. It could be one or the other or both. \n\nYour wife is sick and you kinda need to believe her when she tells you things like she'd rather be hospitalized than around the dog. The dog is a problem because your wife says so. \n\nYou're probably thinking \"but the dog is fine? They're pretty ok?\" It doesn't matter. At all. It's a trigger. This isn't anything against the dog necessarily, but again, it doesn't matter. \n\nI'm so glad your wife can communicate that something is triggering her! This is great news, honestly. It still sucks that your wife is so sick but it's great that she can be conscious enough of her emotional state to know what's setting her off. \n\nI totally get that this is stressful and you're low on options.\n\nIf it's also the sister, can you see if friends can pick a day to come help? Can the sister take a bit of a break for a day? See how that goes.\n\nIf that doesn't work, it may be time for your wife to receive more care and be admitted to the hospital. She is honestly really sick. I think you recognize that it is serious for your whole family, and it's ok to treat your wife like she's sick.", "NAH.  It sounds like your wife needs to be hospitalized.  I'm so sorry.  But the sister should definitely leave if the dog is upsetting your wife that much.\n\nEdit:  It also sounds like you need to take FMLA leave.", "YTA, if the dog is making it worse and your sister insists on bringing it then you're not helping your wife, you're making it worse. It sucks but a lot of people have trouble finding help and maybe you can have a word with her doctors.", "sadly YTA - You tried your best to help your wife by bringing in someone who has experienced something similar to help expect that person brought a dog that is driving your wife insane. So now the options are lose your family or get rid of sister and dog. You know what the right choice is. I would look into government assistance and hospitalization at this point.", "YTA. And no, I don\u2019t care if others disagree. \n\nYour goal is to HELP. Your sisters goal should be to HELP. If the dog is a problem (it sounds like you and your wife do not have a dog of your own and there may be a reason for that) then the dog needs to go. Even if it means your sister also goes. \n\nI want you to imagine sitting on your couch, trying to breastfeed, sleep, rock your baby, whatever\u2026 your boobs are leaking, you\u2019re sleep deprived, you\u2019re lonely, but every single second there is a dog that is panting on you, or has to be resting its paws on you, or also touching you. Or staring at you from across the room. You may be \u201ctouched out\u201d from baby and maybe just want to take a quick shower. There is ZERO way this dog is helpful, and a hundred ways it probably feels like the annoying little brother on a three day road trip who is yelling \u201cIM NOT TOUCHING YOU\u201d while sticking his finger one inch from your face. How freaking irritating would that be?!? Give this poor woman a freakin break! \n\nI\u2019m a dog lover- but your wife may not be. And she\u2019s going through a HUGE event in her life. Get the darn dog out of there. And your sister. Hire help if needed. You\u2019ll never regret going all-in to help get this back on track. \n\nAnd while I\u2019m on my soapbox, just because your sister had a similar experience, she may not be the best at helping during this time. Ask your WIFE if she has someone in mind, or what tasks, or caregiver boundaries would be HELPFUL to her. \n\nBefore any consideration of hospitalization, you need to try to make her home back in to her sanctuary. And some annoying dog is not contributing in a positive way. Get them out of there at least for a couple days and see how it plays out. She deserves the opportunity to have peace and help at home, because otherwise you risk her \u201crecovering\u201d at the hospital and bringing her back to the same shitshow. That\u2019s not fair to her or baby. \n\nAnd if you have to take a couple days off, so be it. Your boss will do what they\u2019ll do, but you cannot have a do-over of these moments and I promise you won\u2019t regret spending a day or two by your wife\u2019s side.", "This isn\u2019t an AITA situation, though it feels like your sister is sort of an AH. Why did she bring her dog? And if it\u2019s clear to you, and your sister (who has been through ppd), that the dog is a huge negative trigger, why is she so against doggy day care? Is it the money? Does she have a friend who can watch the dog? What about your sisters kid? Can they watch the dog? Your parents?  Is there someone else who can stay with you?  Your wife\u2019s mom, a friend? I think you really need to find someone else if your sister is adamant the dog stays with her.", "YTA because the dog is an obvious trigger.\n\nYT bigger A for not knowing anything about the serious condition your wife has.\n\nYou didn't ask her doctor any questions? Couldn't do a Google search?", "YTA for keeping your sister there - something else has to give.  Either your wife goes inpatient or your sister leaves and you find someone else.  I vote for the latter because your sister is being a jerk about her dog knowing how high these stakes are.  I\u2019m sorry you are navigating this. How awful during such a special time.  Hope it gets better soon.", "YTA if you don\u2019t demand sister remove the dog from the home. Her therapists are telling you that the dog is a trigger and triggers will not lead to healing for your wife. Your sister either needs to put the dog in boarding for a while or leave in which case you need to take PTO or unfortunately leave your job. I understand not having money or a job is scary but your wife\u2019s diagnosis means she is a potential danger to herself or others. By not allowing the healing her medical team is asking for, ie no triggers, you are setting yourself up for having a wife hospitalized or worse or something happening to your daughter or even your sister and/or her dog. All of these choices are bad but the easiest one is to board the dog", "YTA \n\nYour sister is noy helping your wife. She is .asking things worse. If sister does come back, the dog needs to go elsewhere.", "NAH. She needs serious medical assistance, more than she is getting now. If her doctors are not already aware of these recent outbursts, PLEASE let them know. Your wife needs help urgently. \n\nYour sister and her dog need to go home immediately. They are causing your wife incredible stress and are contributing to her psychosis. You absolutely ***cannot*** allow your wife to leave your home alone with your baby. The only place where safety for your wife and child is guaranteed is at the hospital. Admitting her is your best option. Take FMLA leave and research more about postpartum psychosis to be able to support your wife and know what she is going through. She needs you now more than ever, and very big steps need to be taken very soon to ensure her and your baby's well-being stays intact.  \n\n\nI'm sorry you and your wife are going through this, OP.", "YTA. This isn't about your sister this is about the DOG that your wife never agreed to have in the home around the newborn", "Look into FMLA. I'm not making a verdict on this one.", "Info: does your job not provide paternal leave? Also, is this dog a support animal?\n\nI think your wife wanted your help specifically. The dog is obviously triggering her. If possible, can you ask for her family to help?", ">Not even sure what psychosis ideation is honestly but I'm assuming it's bad\n\nFirstly WTF are you playing at...if you don't understand then take it upon yourself to learn. This is an absolute must. \n\nSecondly this doesn't seem to be an AITA, at the time your wife agreed to the help from your sister. She isn't the issue it's the dog, something you weren't to know was an issue at the time. \n\nYour sister isn't prepared to get rid of the dog for the time being, so you talk with your wife and come up with other options. \nIs there really absolutely no one else who can help? Even if they just come help out on certain days etc? is there a compromise with the dog? It stays in a room when certain things are happening? \n\n>my sister is 46 and she went through the same thing (diagnosis wise) but hers was bad enough for hospitalization so she has a pretty good understanding, whereas I don't.\n\nAnd again I just need to highlight that you absolutely HAVE to gain an understanding. You cannot continue to be ignorant to what is going on, you cannot help her if you don't have understanding. It is part of your responsibility to know what's happening to your wife and therefore your family.", "Your sister and the dog need to go. They aren\u2019t helping and are making things worse. Take the time off work, apply for FMLA if you have too. Your wife and child are in crisis. Get more involved with her treatment and recovery. The dog is triggering her and it\u2019s only a matter of time before she snaps.", "YTA your sister and her dog are only making your wife worse", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you need OTHER help than your sister. Because your sister comes with a dog, and that makes your wife's condition WORSE.", "NAH but you\u2019ve got to get the dog away from her. It\u2019s triggering her in a way that will not make sense to anyone. It sounds like hospitalization could be best at this point, or see if you can get a full time home health nurse/aid. Your sister and her dog are making it worse.\n\nAlso, look into any public program you can take advantage of at this point. You may very well need to use FMLA provisions and have no income for a while. Make sure any food stamps or other assistance is at the ready so you\u2019ve got something coming in. \n\nAnd finally - I am so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this.", "YTA. \n\nYou need to kick out your sister and her flea bag immediately. \n\nI\u2019ve read through all of the comments and it sounds like she\u2019s the last person who should be \u201chelping\u201d your wife during this difficult time. \n\nThe fact she doesn\u2019t care about being away from her literal child, but refuses to board her dog or let her husband watch it, while she is supposedly being there for your wife\u2026is sickening. \n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine leaving my toddler for even a few hours or overnight. \ud83e\udd28\n\nI\u2019d look for other support options or that program you mentioned.

However this will have to end now.\n\nIt sounds like maybe you don\u2019t work for a big enough company to take FML time and perhaps you have no paternity of paid family leave available. (I\u2019m also assuming you\u2019re in the US just because of the shitty boss and seeming lack of paternity leave but I guess I could be wrong. It does seem to good to be true that there\u2019s a decent hospital program in the US for this situation). \n\nBecause you don\u2019t seem to have any way to take time off, hospitalization is your safest option. This is literal life and death. She needs help to keep herself and your baby safe.", "NAH but maybe you should look into hospitalization at this point. Your wife clearly needs more help than you can give in this particular situation.", "NAH this is a symptom of postpartum psychosis. Update your wife's therapist and doctor. Can you help your sister find a doggie boarding service?", "NTA but your wife needs help. If she doesn't want the dog or your sister then you should ask them to leave.", "yta how many different variations are you going to post about your sister and her dog and you basically forcing your wife to put up with it. yta and so is your sister send your sister and her mutt home and actually fucking take care of your wife and your daughter cause guess what that is your job not your sister's. yta", "I think you need to call her doctor and make them aware of the mood swings ASAP", "NTA. It's part of her condition. You need to speak to her doctors URGENTLY.", "NAH you wife should talk to her therapist about this very very soon.  It sounds like she is really volatile and that is concerning.  I don't think it's really about the dog.  But if there's someone else who doesn't have a dog that could replace your sister then you could consider that.  Hopefully sister understands this is part of the sickness, she's doing a lot to help", "NAH. This is extremely serious. Your sister knows exactly what is going on here. At least to the point of mood swings and everything. However, I highly caution you moving forward. Your wife is not in her right mind, by no fault of her own. Everything she expected for how post pregnancy would go is out the window, and she is trying her best to find herself. Thank goodness she was enough in her right mind to recognize something was wrong and get help. Such a brave, and smart thing to do. And for you, you are trying your best with the best possible person to help both of you through this insanely difficult time.\n\nIf at anytime anyone in the house feels threatened, call IMMEDIATELY for help. As much as it might kill you inside to have your wife committed for any amount of time, it would kill you more if something happened. Whatever you do, don\u2019t fall into a false sense of security, especially with the baby. Never leave her alone with the baby. At least not until she is safely on the other side of this.\n\nIs your sister\u2019s dog an ESA (emotional support animal) or a SD (service dog)? This could be a sign as to why she won\u2019t board the dog for any amount of time. We have a SD that is trained for anxiety purposes (among other things), so I know how helpful your dog can be to you. You don\u2019t need to answer me on this part - but maybe ask your sister. If it\u2019s just her pet, maybe see if she would be willing to let it go to a doggie day care during the day. At least short term to help things.\n\nGood luck OP. NAH. Just a long road ahead for you all.", "NTA, in fact no one is TA right out. \n\nYour wife is not well and dealing with psychosis, so her feelings, triggers, and reactions won't always be logical. Asking your sister to get rid of her dog during the time she spends helping is also not a good solution. \n\nYou need to see if there is anyone else available to help, take FMLA or FST, or admit her to an inpatient facility.", "NTA\n But it does sound like your wife needs hospitalization right now since you aren't able to take off work.

You're trying and you're doing your best.  I would take the dog if I could!  Is there maybe a next door neighbor or a friend that could hear your plea and help? Then the dog won't be so far away and ease your sister's mind a bit.\n\nI think the sister and dog ultimately have to leave otherwise.  You both mean well, but if the dog is causing stress...\n\nI'm sorry!", "NTA, your wife is a danger to your baby and needs to be hospitalized like she says she agrees to be.  Your sister, you, anyone there with her is to keep that baby safe while your wife gets treatment.  Doctors, therapists and meds are what she needs.", "Nah.

Can you send out a bat signal on Facebook or in your neighborhood or to a local church that you are in a bad place and need assistance and support?", "NTA, your wife seems that she needs hospitalization which may be for the best right now.", "NTA \n\nIs the dog being *outside* an option? Maybe that's not such a good idea either though because then your sister would be resentful.\n\nI know people don't care for churches but I wonder if there is a local church with volunteers who could help you. Visiting Angels or some such thing.", "NTA. Can your sister get a pet sitter to go into her house and check on the dogs? The pet sitter I use charges per visit, comes as many times and for as long as I need them. Just a suggestion.", "NTA but I'm not going to mince words and I apologize if this is harsh. \n\nPost partum psychosis means your wife.may kill her, or her child, or any other being she is around (including the dog). It is a very serious medical condition and your wife cannot be left alone. If you're being told the dog is triggering you need to remove that trigger. \n\nThat being said, it is impossible for you to work, care for a baby and care for your wife.

All the rest of my family lives out of state but I'm currently speaking to my mother (whom my wife adores) to see if she would be willing to come help. Fingers crossed.", "Dog troll strikes again.", "The doctors actually told me that if my wife is hospitalized that the baby would be going with her (she's strictly breastfed and they've determined through a lot of evaluations that the baby is at no risk). They said taking her away from the baby could make her spiral further. I'm completely okay with it because whatever helps is what needs to be done. I was just trying to avoid that route.", "She won't send her dog to the doggy daycare. I did find one but she said it's not an option.", "She's not a danger to the baby. That's been determined through multiple professionals. If she is hospitalized (it's been discussed with her therapist and doctor), they have stated that the baby will be going with her. She poses no threat to our child. She poses a direct threat to herself and her triggers- which happens to be the dog.", "My sister is very much so an individual who refuses to be away from her dog for any period of time. I mean, she's been away from her child for a week straight but she hasn't spoken about her once. Her dog however.. that's a hard no. So she won't let the dog stay at home with her husband or send him outside without her or anything.", "Dog abuser", "Well she has a husband and child at home who could take the dog but she just refuses to be away from her dog at all and has said no to all my suggestions.", "The fuck she is. She has a legitimate diagnosis that's extremely severe. Don't go there.", "Nah means no is ah", "I love animals but i\u2019m also a mom and have been through the motions, the wife yelling about the dog isn\u2019t the kindest thing but unless you know how she feels after giving birth to a whole human i don\u2019t think you can say she\u2019s the asshole. the feelings we get postpartum are indescribable. it\u2019s not like the wife physically hurt the dog. show a bit of compassion", "It definitely scared the shit out of my wife when she first was overcome with the feelings she was having. She checked herself in to the hospital as soon as she got the initial feeling of dread and unaliving herself. I'm so glad she did because I wasn't even aware that there was any issues.", " Exactly !? Op literally said they can\u2019t afford for him to stop working and this person says he needs to basically forget what his boss says and to stop working . Like that\u2019s the dumbest shit I ever read money doesn\u2019t grow on trees and bills don\u2019t stop he literally can\u2019t just stop working well I mean he can but then like you said they\u2019ll be on the streets but with a newborn \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I fully understand what FMLA is.  There's \"stuck\" and there's life or death.  This is a life or death situation.", "They don\u2019t know personal boundaries because owners don\u2019t teach their dog better because their dog \u201ccan do no wrong\u201d. The untrained owners are the problem and OP sister is one of them.", "I Google anything my wife ever has even if it's minor if I don't know about it.\n\nSide note, that's how I learned all about yeast infections \ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s unacceptable behavior from an employer. You need to learn to assert yourself with them. You do have rights. Are you eligible for FML based on where you work? Are you in a state that has paid family leave?", "Yeah I definitely would ask her. How about your wife\u2019s family?", "If you\u2019re in the states, you should look into FMLA, family and medical leave act. It\u2019s generally leave without pay, but your boss can\u2019t fire you. Your boss should\u2019ve never been calling you to go into work while you were out on paternity leave.", "I hate to say it, but I don\u2019t think that route can be avoided now.", "It sucks but it sounds like that's what your wife and baby need.", "That's really cool, I've worked in a few inpatient behavioral hospitals and haven't heard of that option. I totally understand that  hospitalization is a last resort, but at least you know she's safe. She'll also have access to medication and some kind of group therapy to hopefully ground her and teach her new coping skills. Hoping the best for you all!", "Yeah, so if that\u2019s the case then she is not helping. There is no rational reason to refuse that option, even just for a few days until you figure out another solution. You are between a rock and a hard place. Your wife\u2019s behavior is due to her condition, obviously. She can\u2019t help her reactions, and the reason it\u2019s out of the norm for her is because she is dealing with postpartum mental health issues. But your sister? She\u2019s just making things harder for you and your wife. If she doesn\u2019t want to put her dog in daycare that is her choice, but that means she needs to go. And you should let her know she\u2019s left you in a very difficult position.\n\nBTW, there\u2018s no excuse for you not knowing what postpartum psychosis is. If you can post on Reddit, you can do a damn google search for the term and educate yourself. It\u2019s a serious condition and you really need to know what you\u2019re dealing with. It\u2019s not safe to leave your wife alone until she\u2019s better, but having something in the home that provokes her so intensely could result in her having a full-blown psychotic break, and that could be dangerous for her, or your baby. CALL HER DOCTOR. Let them help you figure out what to do.", "Why is this not an option? I'm seriously side-eyeing how helpful your sister is at this time. She should be able to empathize with your wife's stress but if she isn't able, she might be more stress than help to your situation.", "is there a reason why? financial, or the dog has separation anxiety? if there really is no option- then instead of your sister do you think it\u2019d be better if you talk to one of your wife\u2019s good friends about coming over to help?", "Can you possibly bring the dog to work with you? i know that may be an ignorant question but between a rejection of doggy daycare, and having it at home as a trigger for your wife idk any other way?\n\nI own dogs myself and this may be shitty for everyone but is there an area of the house the dog can be confined to during the day and then at night it can be confined in the room your sister sleeps in? \n\nHow about sending the dog to your parents, or maybe your wife has some family nearby who can take it.. doesn't the sister have a friend she can pay to take care of the dog?\n\nthis is a more serious situation then just dog sitting, it's kinda an family emergency type dealio", "Did she explain why it is not an option?", "If her trigger is the dog, then Dog absolutely does not need to be coming back over.", "She needs to be in a hospital.  Danger to herself and others is a clear criteria for hospitalization.  And it\u2019s interesting that all the doctors don\u2019t think the baby could become her target.  I don\u2019t believe any doctor is going to say the baby is safe around someone in active psychosis and I would take that chance and leave her alone with the baby.\n\nBut all you seem to be worried about is the dog.  So ok.", "Then Sister is not an appropriate person to be helping, especially since Dog is a trigger for your wife.", "Uhhh, that's not a good sign. Your sister might just not be able to help your wife the way everyone (including your sister) wants.\n\nThat's not a dis towards anyone, I think that's just a fact.", "Don't start that shit. Dogs being outside is not abusive.", "OP you are seriously not considering how selfish this is of your sister. Offering to help but refusing to remove your wife\u2019s trigger is the opposite of help and extremely selfish. Send her home and figure literally anything else out", "OP your sister is the AH and you\u2019re enabling her. Your wife is and should be your priority.", "Then you need to take fmla leave and stay with her at all times.  There was a woman not too long ago who killed her children while the father left to go pick up food.  Less than 15 min alone with the children and they were gone.   You need to step up and if your wife leaves with the baby call police.", "I\u2019ve been annoyed with my dogs at my feet but never to the point of a \u201cor else\u201d threat.", "I'm so glad for your wife too. Mental health during this time of life is so important for mom and baby. I wish I hadn't been so sick with my first.\n\nI honestly hope that OP's wife and baby are successfully taken care of in the hospital and that they get the care they need right now.", "I never said you didnt know what FMLA was I assume you do since you suggested it. However he already said he cant take off thats the entire reason for the problem. Therefore its probably better for her to be hospitalized which she isnt opposed to doing. If he is the sole income and its this tight where he doesnt feel he can send \u201cthe help\u201d away cz his wife cant be alone even when said help is making it worse then its safe to think that they can afford for him to be off. They could be 1-2 paychecks from being homeless which also won\u2019t help his wife. Im sure he would prefer to be the one to stay home with his wife they are in a terrible position right now.", "Her parents passed away in a car wreck two years ago unfortunately. She was an only child and they were all she said for family that isn't estranged.", "He can\u2019t take a leave without pay they can\u2019t afford it. Are y\u2019all actually reading the post ??\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I was actually told it's a new program. I guess that they've been researching it for awhile through trial and error and have found that in a lot of cases, post partum psychosis can take a turn for the worst if the momma is removed from the baby (because then feelings of guilt and confusion set in). So it's currently in its first year of the program, where they implicate group therapy with the mom's and babies and I guess it's going quite well with a very high and quick turn around. Super awesome!", "She just said it's not an option. She refuses to be away from her dog at all. She's been away from her kid for a week but refuses to be away from her dog.", "She just said she shouldn't have to \"traumatize her baby\" by putting him in a doggy daycare so she can babysit my wife. All of my wife's friends unfortunately live very busy lives. They do come over and help out but it's not for the entire time I'm gone- which is kind of what she needs.", "You're not very bright are ya?", "Cool story. Have you ever had postpartum psychosis and depression? If not, I don't care what you've been through because you are not the person in question here and your experiences don't matter in reference to my question.", "Exactly", "I did read the post. He said his boss is a prick and won\u2019t let him take time off and they need the money. He may not have a choice but to take time off work. He needs to know what options are available to him. \n\nHe may also be able to apply for financial assistance of some kind if he has to take time off of work unpaid.", "This is strange ok being away from her own child, but not ok to be away from the dog.\n\nIs it her emotional support animal?\nIf not and there is no valid reason for that, your sister sounds petty.", "Yeahhhh, all the dogs I know who go to daycare actually love it. To the point where we called it the resort or otherwise the dog gets too sad about missing out.\n\nYour sister may mean well but it doesn't sound like she's healthy enough to be in this situation to provide the help your wife needs.", "If its possible find a helper who will come during the day and help around the house. And send your sister away, because her actions looks really sellfish.", "I gotta say - I\u2019m busy af, but if my best friend\u2019s husband called me and said my friend was having a mental health crisis and they desperately needed my help for a couple of days while they arranged other care, you bet your ass I would be there. This is the time to call in the *whole* village (friends, family, and neighbors) and ask who can take a day off to stay home with your wife so you can still put food on the table while you figure out how to get your wife into that hospital program for moms and babies.", "So, she'd rather traumatize and retrigger your wife continually? Let your wife go to hospital or send your wife to your mum/have mum come to you but send your sister home. She isn't doing anything but harm your wife now if she won't make concessions about the dog.", "Brilliant retort.", "So any answer that doesn't fit your taste you disregard.\n\nBad boy Matches", "Well if we\u2019re delving into depression, I have chronic depression clinically diagnosed by my doctor and have suffered a few psychotic breaks to the point of delusions and hallucinations. Top on some severe bouts of paranoia. still didn\u2019t threaten others or their dogs.", "You're completely missing the point here. If you haven't experienced ***postpartum psychosis***, you truly have no idea what OP and his wife are going through. No form of depression or psychosis is comparable. Postpartum psychosis is the severest form of mental illness according to the National Library of Medicine. Your experiences have absolutely nothing to do with anyone else's. She is triggered by the dog and the dog needs to go, end of story.", "Having a baby and being overcome with feelings of psychosis and depression is much different than chronic depression and psychotic breaks. There's no comparison. Not to mention the fact that if you've been seen by multiple professionals, you should be fully aware of the fact that not one single case is the exact same as someone else's. My wife is not you. You are no where in comparison to my wife. Stop trying to make the comparison.", "You\u2019re right, i missed the point on that entirely and I apologize for that and I hope OP knows that.", "I\u2019m not trying to make the comparison, I\u2019m trying to iterate a point that your wife\u2019s mental situation is a volatile one, I\u2019m sorry my comment was horribly written at trying to convey that. I do hope your wife improves swiftly."]}
