Also, it's entirely possible that if she had approached you with kindness and explained her mistake, that maybe you'd hand them to her. \n\nShe didn't, so her mistake remains.  She lost a deal on the boots.", "NTA.\nShe\u2019s probably lying anyways lmao, if you wanted to buy something, why would you put it back on the shelf? Seems silly to me.\nYou did nothing wrong, and good for you for not giving in to her entitled and rude demands", "NTA. She left them on the shelf, so they were fair game. She shouldn't have accused you without any proof. Enjoy your awesome find!", "Good grief.   If you think you want something you keep it with you in a basket or trolley.   You don't put it back and assume no one else wants it. \n\nI worked a library years ago (when they had lots of books) and part of morning before opening was for all staff to check the shelves.  Put them back in order etc.  \n\nA man  came in one morning ranting because the book he had hidden two days before wasn't there anymore.  He was keeping it because he didn't have enough room on his card and brought a return so he could get that.  He had taken a popular fiction and hidden it in science or something, but hey staff go through the shelves on a daily basis.   He had to wait for the return.  But it was our fault he couldn't get it. Listened to his rant just  to ask why he just didn't take the first time.", "I don't know who these people are that have the gull to just walk up making demands like that. It's ridiculous.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She accused you of taking them from her cart when she made the mistake of not putting them in the cart. Methinks she didn't want them until she could no longer have them.", "NTA.  I have been the person who dithered and didn\u2019t put something in my cart.  And lost out when I went back just as someone else put it in their cart.  I didn\u2019t have a hissy fit about it.  I chalked it up to snoozing and losing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's been a minute since a stranger was that nice to *me!*", "OMG\u2026.you saw a product on the shelf in a store and had the audacity to think that it was available for you to buy, how inconsiderate of you not to think that someone had kept it there by mistake. LOL,she made a mistake and must face the consequences. Credit to you for going the length to explain to her and listen to all her crap, most ppl would just walk away. Enjoy your boots without guilt.\nNTA.", "Such a weird idea to do at a library. As an aside it is funny to think about a limit since my library has no limit, like I see elderly people bringing back like twenty books, I myself check out over fifty children books, couple video games, couple dvds, and a couple books and have three weeks plus renewals, (although we usually just need a week anyways).", "This was quite a while ago.  We had limits on the amount of items to be taken at one time.  And renewals were all good. \n\nWe found all sorts of things in the shelves , not just hidden books.", "NTA - if you intend to buy it, you put it in your cart. If it's on the shelves then it is available for purchase. By this logic you could walk up to anyone in any store and demand something they have simply because you say you want it.", "nta"]}
