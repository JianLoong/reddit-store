Other people's lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on your part. \n\nI one time worked for a startup educational technology company where they had less than 13 people when I first started. I reported directly up to the CIO and I had thought everything was perfect. Once we started expanding, to my surprise, they hired a few more IT staff, including an IT manager I reported to instead. The thing is, I lived so close to the office, it was maybe a 5 minute drive to get home, enjoy my lunch and food for 45 minutes, get back in 5 minutes, and still be back with 5 minutes to spare. \n\nWell, the new IT Manager didn't like I did this. He insisted that I was \"not a team player\" and that he found it disrespectful that I would not go to with them to \"team lunches\". So one day, I decided not to go home and joined them for their team lunch. We went to a fairly expensive restaurant in the area despite my multiple suggestions for other places that were not expensive. Well, sure enough, my suspicions were correct that the lunches were NOT paid for and we had to pay for the lunches ourselves. \n\nThe following day, I wrote an email to the CIO, IT Manager, and Head of HR explaining that going forward, anytime I am not clocked in, the times I am not getting paid for, I am entitled to do whatever I want to. If the IT Manager wanted to take offense to this, then that is up to him to deal with. I further explained that I would not deny staying afterhours to do work, but that was with the intention that there is a project to be done or if I had work I hadn't completed. \n\nWell, this didn't last long. About 2 or so months after the fact, I was laid off by the IT Manager. His exact reason was \"It's because you just aren't a team player.\" I legit just scoffed at him and said \"Wow..so just because I wouldn't go with you guys to lunch I am being laid off? That's genuinely sad...ya know what, fine...this is for the best.\" \n\nI did run into the IT Manager several years later. Turns out the company went under after reports of a toxic environment got out and no one wanted to apply for the positions available. \n\nWhat I am saying with this is value your time. You are not the asshole. Stand up for the time that is meant for you. For people who say that they would not want to work with you, I would not want to work with them either.

Many people don't like that person because of their rigidity.

Don't assume you're invincible and you'll never need anyone else's help.", "This. A few months ago I realized I had a work emergency. It was 6 pm and I needed something by 8 the next day. My career was literally on the line. I texted a coworker and asked for help, and he did it for me no questions asked (just as I have done for others in the past). This doesn\u2019t happen often (it\u2019s the first time I can think of it happening with this particular coworker) but occasionally something comes up after hours. \n\nA few weeks later we were talking about who to suggest for a round of promotions. I put his name up because he has become such a huge team player and he was promoted. If shit like that happens every day it is not ok, but sometimes shit hits the fan and you need help outside of work hours. If you want to make forward progression in your career you have to help out.", "Right?  These \"I would hate to work with OP\"s are really telling on themselves.", ">People who hand finish their work right before a deadline when their part was needed by others\n\nThat sounds more like a planning issue.

There's coworkers I fucking hate that I would probably stay over to help depending on the circumstances.", "NTA. Please include this tidbit in your post.

Nothing in the post indicates that OP doesn't help or talk to his coworker while at work. He just refuses to do it OFF THE CLOCK. Y'all are getting mad at him because he wants to keep work and personal life separate? Heaven forbid, he wants privacy and to LIVE HIS OWN LIFE.

I'm still absolutely within my right to say \"No,\" of course, but other people are also free to think that I'm being the AH if I tell someone that my desire to literally do nothing on my couch is more important than someone else's desire to see their child's recital or attend a wedding or attend a sick relative or whatever other time sensitive thing might be happening. \n\nYou don't have to believe that work is family--I absolutely don't--to think that telling someone your picnic is *more important* than them making their child's recital is an AH move.", "There's a difference between saying \"I am not contracted for overtime\" which is what they should have said.

So I guess we're pathetic together.", "I had very much the same attitude as OP until my mom changed my outlook. I was asking her why she was taking on extra work to help out a colleague with a personal issue, basically saying \"that's not your problem\" and she pointed out that years ago when her partner had cancer and she was dealing with chemo and end of life prep and all that shit, her colleagues had always helped her out when she needed it. I don't think work colleagues should have to help each other out all the time or anything, but I do think it's good to pay some kindness forward. You never know when you will really need help", "Work is not your friend though.  How many posts do we see about someone being on-call all the time?

Being able to enjoy your own time is a powerful skill. I love being alone majority of the time like I literally look forward to my alone time. And no people typically use each other which hey you gotta give a lil to get a lil but if OP made this far helping them selves I think be okay many years to come. I actually admire OP for not being a people pleaser. You only live once and you should do what makes you happy not what makes other lives easier.
