One of the things I managed to get was a clause that prohibited my employer from contacting me outside work hours. \n\nIf it is a true emergency, then they can send me an email. Otherwise they can't even send me a text.\n\nFurthermore, I have a separate work phone that I shut down at 5 on the dot, then turn on at 9am.\n\nAnother thing is that I don't work OT. I am very efficient, so my work is done by 3pm, 5pm if we have an emergency. I also take my whole lunch break outside the office, and my coffee breaks away from my desk.\n\nMy coworkers are not the same, they tend to socialize during work hour, and have work left for afterwards. \n\nThey sometimes ask me to \"help\", but I always decline by saying that I have plans. I don't go into details, I just say that I have plans.\n\nThese plans are 99% of the time just include going home, reading books, or sleeping. But that is my personal time.\n\nMonday, a coworker asked me if I could stay a bit later to help her out, apparently she was late with some essential work, but had to be done by that night, because she had to attend her daughter's recital at 6. I said that I was sorry, but that I had plans.\n\nIt was a nice day, so instead of going home, I just went to a parc to read while breathing some fresh air. Brought some fruit and bubble tea, and made a picnic out of it.\n\nMy coworker found me there, and she was pissed. She said that I could have helped her if I didn't have plans, I said that I do have plans, this impromptu picnic. She said that it wasn't as important as her daughter's recital. So I said that for me, it was even more important than her daughter's recital.\n\nShe called me an AH, and some of my friends agree. So AITA?\n\nEdit: so I log off for a few hours, log back in expecting maaaybe 100 comments. I am blown, and thank everyone for their judgement, NTA, YTA or ESH.\n\nNow for some important things:\n\n- How did she find me in the park? The park is small, near her daughter's school (I didn't know that), and I was sitting closer to the street. She was driving by looking for parking when she spotted me, and decided to confront me. I guess she wasn't that late for the recital.\n\n- We are not on the same team. She asked for help because she knew I know how to do her tasks, not because we are on the same team working the same project.\n\n- For people who are worried about my career, thank you, but don't worry. I am not planning to climb the corporate ladder. All I want is a job that pays enough to live a comfortable middle class life. I invested in a bit of a niche/rare skillset, and it paid me back with a 6 figure salary and being very sought after. All I have to do is to maintain my skillset and keep up with the times, and I will be golden. I have had offers from all around my state, and a few more.\n\n- For those who say that I am a miserable loner, I have a very fulfilling personal life, with a tight knit family, and a great friend circle. I just prefer to not mix work and personal life, and that means no befriending coworkers. Made that mistake early on, but I learned from it.\n\n- And lastly, for those saying an impromptu picnic is not \"plans\", enjoying my personal time *is* and has always been my plans.", "created_utc": 1681398263, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ks6e1/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_that_my_solo_picnic/", "score": 12299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Other people's lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on your part. \n\nI one time worked for a startup educational technology company where they had less than 13 people when I first started. I reported directly up to the CIO and I had thought everything was perfect. Once we started expanding, to my surprise, they hired a few more IT staff, including an IT manager I reported to instead. The thing is, I lived so close to the office, it was maybe a 5 minute drive to get home, enjoy my lunch and food for 45 minutes, get back in 5 minutes, and still be back with 5 minutes to spare. \n\nWell, the new IT Manager didn't like I did this. He insisted that I was \"not a team player\" and that he found it disrespectful that I would not go to with them to \"team lunches\". So one day, I decided not to go home and joined them for their team lunch. We went to a fairly expensive restaurant in the area despite my multiple suggestions for other places that were not expensive. Well, sure enough, my suspicions were correct that the lunches were NOT paid for and we had to pay for the lunches ourselves. \n\nThe following day, I wrote an email to the CIO, IT Manager, and Head of HR explaining that going forward, anytime I am not clocked in, the times I am not getting paid for, I am entitled to do whatever I want to. If the IT Manager wanted to take offense to this, then that is up to him to deal with. I further explained that I would not deny staying afterhours to do work, but that was with the intention that there is a project to be done or if I had work I hadn't completed. \n\nWell, this didn't last long. About 2 or so months after the fact, I was laid off by the IT Manager. His exact reason was \"It's because you just aren't a team player.\" I legit just scoffed at him and said \"Wow..so just because I wouldn't go with you guys to lunch I am being laid off? That's genuinely sad...ya know what, fine...this is for the best.\" \n\nI did run into the IT Manager several years later. Turns out the company went under after reports of a toxic environment got out and no one wanted to apply for the positions available. \n\nWhat I am saying with this is value your time.

Talking to your cat while you cook dinner. Watching paint dry. No one, absolutely *no one* owes their free time to an employer or their coworkers. Coworkers\u2019 children are not more important than your plans. They made a choice to procreate. They made a choice to enroll their child in an activity. Now they need to plan accordingly, without making their choices the responsibility of coworkers.

My department is broken down into four teams that focus on different aspects of our job. Our workloads vary because it all depends on what external departments send us, so we wind up helping each other out because that\u2019s just what we do. \n\nYou say that you never ask anyone for help and you don\u2019t expect any favors. But, there\u2019s a first time for everything. There is a possibility that at some point, you may need someone else\u2019s help. Wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea to have just a little bit of good will on your side?", "I understand you don't help anyone after hours or during breaks. But do you at least help a teammate within work hours? I think a lot of people are confused about that and assume that you don't help at all.", "In other words, teenagers.", "Ope my bad", "Thank you so much, I\u2019m childless; not by choice, and you were much more eloquent than me.  I\u2019ll add it\u2019s especially hard on women.  People assume you have a breadwinner husband, so your income is less consequential. Other women will lean on you and guilt you over a kid issue in a way they wouldn\u2019t dare treat a male colleague.  Also we pay way more in taxes than you.  \n\nFertility issues compounded by early (37) widowhood kinda led me here.  I cannot tell you how many times I\u2019ve been told I don\u2019t deserve a popular vacation week or holiday off because somebody else has kids.  \n\nI had to show my boss the newspaper announcement to get the weekend of my brother\u2019s wedding off (I put the request in 3 months before so it would be in before anyone else) because it was Halloween weekend and she felt like the parents of kids should be off, but \u201cif there really was a wedding I could have it (I should have just quit). \n\nI was even once told by a coworker that I didn\u2019t deserve any of the department\u2019s profit share because I didn\u2019t have kids and my husband had a \u201cgood job\u201d and giving me part of the money was taking it away from \u201csomeone who actually needed it\u201d.  I\u2019ve been told maybe I should sell my house (it\u2019s a 1700 sq ft rancher, so not even remotely a mansion) and move into something smaller instead of getting the raise I asked for.  \n\nI could go on and on.  \nTLDR Stop thinking your life is more special because you had a kid.  We already get screwed on taxes, stop screwing us at work.", "It is never a good idea to mix work with personnel. I learned the hard way. One day they are your bff and the next day they betray you and try to \u201cexpose\u201d you. \n\nThe coworker just wanted OP to pick up their slack without trying to make it work. The coworker still made it without OP having to sacrifice their time and they both won. The coworker would not have done the same for OP. They are not respecting OP limitations. The coworker expected OP to support them but they did not want to respect their wishes. The coworker was out of line.", "But work absolutely is transactional.", "Capitalism injects that transactional element into everything though. \n\nI am much more collaborative at work than OP, I have to be because my work requires a lot of shared effort and outcomes. But I maintain strong boundaries. I work when I'm working and not when I'm not. I ask for reasonable accommodations to make my work more bearable, and I advocate for for accommodations for others in my workplace. \n\nI agree with OP philosophically, I've just found a different praxis.", "Right? It sounds like she lives a happy life, as she's able to leave work early enough that she can go read in the park in daylight. That's goals right there. Why is it her fault that her coworker couldn't manage her time well enough to attend her daughter's recital?", "Which might never happen, too. What if OP either never needs help, or... shocker... the coworkers still refuse to help out? These people are asking OP to sacrifice hours of their real, tangible, and very *limited* life, for a maybe. For something that may not even happen."]}
