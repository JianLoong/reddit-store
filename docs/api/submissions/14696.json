Other people's lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on your part. \n\nI one time worked for a startup educational technology company where they had less than 13 people when I first started. I reported directly up to the CIO and I had thought everything was perfect. Once we started expanding, to my surprise, they hired a few more IT staff, including an IT manager I reported to instead. The thing is, I lived so close to the office, it was maybe a 5 minute drive to get home, enjoy my lunch and food for 45 minutes, get back in 5 minutes, and still be back with 5 minutes to spare. \n\nWell, the new IT Manager didn't like I did this. He insisted that I was \"not a team player\" and that he found it disrespectful that I would not go to with them to \"team lunches\". So one day, I decided not to go home and joined them for their team lunch. We went to a fairly expensive restaurant in the area despite my multiple suggestions for other places that were not expensive. Well, sure enough, my suspicions were correct that the lunches were NOT paid for and we had to pay for the lunches ourselves. \n\nThe following day, I wrote an email to the CIO, IT Manager, and Head of HR explaining that going forward, anytime I am not clocked in, the times I am not getting paid for, I am entitled to do whatever I want to. If the IT Manager wanted to take offense to this, then that is up to him to deal with. I further explained that I would not deny staying afterhours to do work, but that was with the intention that there is a project to be done or if I had work I hadn't completed. \n\nWell, this didn't last long. About 2 or so months after the fact, I was laid off by the IT Manager. His exact reason was \"It's because you just aren't a team player.\" I legit just scoffed at him and said \"Wow..so just because I wouldn't go with you guys to lunch I am being laid off? That's genuinely sad...ya know what, fine...this is for the best.\" \n\nI did run into the IT Manager several years later. Turns out the company went under after reports of a toxic environment got out and no one wanted to apply for the positions available. \n\nWhat I am saying with this is value your time. You are not the asshole. Stand up for the time that is meant for you. For people who say that they would not want to work with you, I would not want to work with them either.
