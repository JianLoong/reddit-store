Since we plan on moving back we do not want to sell our house. We don't want to rent the house out because we also plan on coming back to visit and staying here periodically. However, we do want someone living here during this time to keep an eye on things. An unoccupied house is not good for our insurance and if there's a problem we want someone there to notice it right away.\n\nWe think the perfect person is our niece, Kayla and her fianc\u00e9e (Jordan). Kayla (and Jordan sometimes) have already stayed in our house alone to housesit and watch our dogs many times while we've been away. We've never had a problem with them. Also since Kayla and Jordan do not have much furniture or household items that take up space. This is a plus to us because that means we will not have to have our furniture stored. We do not want our things getting damaged or stolen in storage. We will only need to clear out two of the bedrooms for Kayla and Jordan to have for their own private use. This arrangement also works out really well for Kayla and Jordan because they have been trying to save for a down payment on a home of their own and we would let them live here rent free.\n\nMy sister has since found out about this arrangement. She asked for me to reconsider because she thinks she and her family have more of a need. She and her husband live in a 2 bedroom apartment with their 3 kids and 1 baby. She says her kids need the space more as they are getting older and need more privacy than before and she and her husband feel bad that they can't give them that right now. They also would like to save up for a home of their own, but are having a hard time because rent cost so much.\n\nNeither my husband or I are comfortable with them living here. We feel like 6 people in the house are more likely to cause damage to our house or things. Especially the children. We would be forced to store a lot of our furniture to make room. There would be no space for us to stay in our own house when we come to visit. My sister countered by saying they could store their furniture instead, but we don't want them using ours. My sister also said that when we come to visit we can stay in one of the kids rooms while the kids stay in the living room. That also isn't an appealing idea to us. We want our stays to be a bit more peaceful. I explained this to my sister and she did seem to understand that her kids can make things hectic, so she offered to pay for us to stay in a hotel when we came to visit, but we want to stay in our house during visits.\n\nIt keeps getting brought up of how much of a huge difference this would make to my sister and her family. Nothings been set in stone with Kayla and Jordan as we haven't signed a lease with them yet. We want to, but we're sort of feeling guilty, but also we would be worrying the whole time they are living here.", "created_utc": 1677103015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119f2bz/wibta_for_letting_my_niece_live_in_my_house_rent/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are doing someone a HUGE favor with free rent. So that is UP TO YOU to decide who you feel is the right person/people to give that favor to.\n\nThe peace of mind alone sounds like it's worth Kayla & Jordan being the ones watching the house. Plus it's more convenient when you visit, and you don't have the added cost of storing your own furniture, or the wear/tear/damage from kids using your furniture.\n\nJust because someone tries to guilt you doesn't mean you are the AH. You are not. Your house, your decision.", "NTA, they probably would cause more wear and tear on the house, and they might not move out when you returned either (in their eyes you would be kicking them and their 4 children out into a smaller space). Also you made the decision already so changing it could be an AH move.", "NTA. The purpose of this is to have a house sitter, not to change your sister\u2019s life. And you are allowed to say \u201cno\u201d for whatever reason you want. \n\nSomething else to consider: if you are having this much trouble saying \u201cno\u201d to your sister now, what is going to happen when you come back in 3 years and she has to move out? Will she argue that it is unfair because the kids have gotten used to the house and that it would be cruel to uproot them? And that they can\u2019t afford another place to live that is similar to your home because they have gotten used to a house your size?", "NTA. A family of six with 4 kids will put a lot more wear and tear on your home and furnishings.  Coming home from an international stay would also be so much more relaxing in your own home without six people being around.  Go with your gut, ignore your sister trying to pressure you.", "NTA,\n\nYour house, you can do with it what you want. Either way you are helping family out. \n\nBut you need to be comfortable with who you are leaving in charge.

Damage with 4 kids is inevitable as well.", "NTA. Above all other reasons, it's your house, nobody is entitled to use it, you get to decide who you feel is the best fit. Your sister's situation is obviously not ideal, but that doesn't mean you have to allow her family to move into your home, especially when that's more fuss for you. She and her husband should not be counting on this as an option nor should they be upset with you for not letting them stay there.", "NTA - The wear and tear on your house would be significantly more if your sister and her kids moved in and it is your right to lease it to whoever you want. Your sisters situation is understandable but if you are going to have 4 kids when you have a small apartment that is in you.", "NTA. You already offered your niece the option, and pulling that away now would be an AH move. Also, you absolutely get to decide if you want kids running around and abusing your house for 3 years. And the point about having a place to stay when you come visit is entirely valid- using a kids bedroom when you visit (so like- bunk beds?! Or two twin beds??) is not an acceptable way to visit your own home. \n\nIt makes sense that this would be beneficial for your sister, but it would NOT be beneficial to you. Offering it to your niece would be mutually beneficial. You do not need to do something nice for someone else at your own expense. You had a plan, and you can stick to it.", "Look into the law. I may be wrong, but if you let sister and her kids move in and they get mail there, if could be VERY hard to move them out.", "NTA, just make certain  your niece knows your sister cannot move in.

Even though 3 years doesn\u2019t seem like much it\u2019s still a long time specially when you have kids and the damages done to the house can be greater than you would expect due to negligence of having the kids running around in places .

Your house, your decision.", "NTA it's your house, so you get to deside.", "NTA, it is your home and you should decid what\\`s best for you.

At no point in time did they think, hmmmmm maybe we should stop having children until we can afford a bigger apt?\n\nI would not let them move in. Kids are destructive.   And there's a good chance they'll refuse to leave when you come back 'You don't need the space and we do!!!!!!'", "NTA. \n\nTwo adults cause less wear and tear and take up less space than a couple and their 4 children. \n\nYour niece is just as deserving of an opportunity to save and have space as your sister is. \n\nThe fact that your sister cannot understand why a couple with little furniture is different than a family of 6, along with her lack of comprehension of you wanting to come back and stay in your home as if you still live there, is why you would worry about her staying there. She lacks basic critical thinking skills, or she thinks you are dumb enough to not understand the differences yourself. Either way, that would make me extremely nervous to let her stay in my home. Then add to that 4 children, who no matter how great they are, are going to destroy things at a faster rate than a few adults. \n\nGive a firm no, sign the lease, and make sure your niece knows your sister might be a problem and to not let her and her family in to the home while you are gone.", "NTA.

You're looking for an extended housesitter, your sister is looking for a new place to live.  What are her plans when, after she's settled in for three years, you come back and she has to vacate?", "NTA.  Your niece may have less of a need for help, but this isn't a question on who needs/deserves help more.  Your arrangement with your niece is one that is mutually beneficial and far less complicated than an arrangement involving your sister and a ton of kids.\n\nIf something unexpected happend and you needed to move back with little notice, that would be a major problem for you and your sister and the kids.  You are well aware that the conditions would be strained for short visits back... sounds downright intolerable if there was an emergent return and two families were sharing the space.  \n\nYou have no obligation to put yourself into a less favorable spot to make life easier for your sister.", ">My sister has since found out about this arrangement. She asked for me to reconsider because she thinks she and her family have more of a need. She and her husband live in a 2 bedroom apartment with their 3 kids and 1 baby. She says her kids need the space more as they are getting older and need more privacy than before\n\nIt's too bad this couldn't have ever been predicted before they had children!\n\nIt's your house.  You are not obligated to cater to your sister's wants.  I say wants because clearly they have managed to live at their current place for some time.  It's not as if they are homeless. \n\nAlso, what would they do once you moved back? Move out again? Or try to convince you to give them the house and you buy a new one? \n\nYWNBTA", "NTA if you let your sister move in they will not move out. And getting someone evicted with children is a nightmare situation. Not counting how destructive little kids to be.

She is already agreeing when you visit it would not be logical for your to stay in your own home. What happens when she refuses to live when the 3 years are up. Are you willing to go through court and make them homeless. I do not see this working out for you if your sister moves in. Also do not let your niece live rent free at least charge her a $1.00 a month.", "NTA\n\nThough I highly recommend getting a ring door bell or outside cameras set up which you have complete access to. Tell K & J this and offer them access too. Tell them you aren\u2019t spying on them but you are worried about the blowback from saying no to your sister and you just want to keep them and your property safe. \n\nSeriously, get cameras. Also don\u2019t let your sister move in. As soon as she gets mail sent there, you are going to have the worst time evicting her.

Your reasoning is sound.", "NTA\n\nThis is your house and you are choosing a house-sitter. It's not a charity. \n\nYou wouldn't be wrong to offer it to your sister either btw. But if you did, it would be with a substantial damage deposit.\n\nIf you want to let her down gently, you can say that it is very important to you that your house be available to you at all times when you return and that means that your bedroom is entirely off limits.
