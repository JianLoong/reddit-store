My sister and I both have those middle names. Hers is Patricia after a cousin of our mom's and mine is Denise after my dad's aunt.\n\nAlmost a year ago my sister lost her 2 day old son, Philip. He was the last family member we lost and it was a huge, earth shattering blow for our family.\n\nI found out I was pregnant a few months ago. I waited a while to tell anyone and my sister was the first person we told, privately. When I told her she said it would be nice to have some positive news to focus on and she wanted me to continue the tradition our family keeps and give my baby, if a boy, the middle name Philip. She was so happy about the idea. It surprised me a lot. I would have figured she would not be okay with it. But she wanted it.\n\nThe problem is my husband and I do not want to continue with the tradition. We do not want to give our son the middle name Philip. The name isn't one either of us likes or would ever pick ourselves... We have not announced the sex of our baby yet but my husband and I know we are expecting a boy.\n\nMy family were saying how amazing it will be if my baby is a boy and Philip's name can be carried on... I suggested they wait until we announce the sex and the name before jumping to conclusions. They asked why and I said we were thinking of not continuing with the tradition. My family, and by that I mean my parents mostly, were really upset. My sister was the worst though. She asked why I wouldn't want to honor Philip and why it was him the tradition was getting broken on. She asked if I saw him as meaning so little and I said no, of course not. Then she asked if it was his name and we didn't like it. She said she really hoped it wasn't that. I said we just didn't feel like the tradition was something we wanted to continue.\n\nThe decision has brought up a lot of bad feelings and my sister is especially angry and thinks I'm being insensitive and showing how little I care for my nephew. I feel terrible. She's so angry at me and my parents are unhappy as well. My husband hates them for putting this pressure on us. He said we should be allowed to name our son what we want and we should not be obliged to use a certain name.

Turned out we had a boy, but if we had a girl, I would have stuck heavily to my guns.\n\nIts a lot of pressure! Especially for you as its your sisters baby son.

If it were an elderly grandparent who\u2019d died last, you\u2019d be NTA, and no one would feel especially alighted by you breaking the tradition for whatever reason. \n\nBut you can\u2019t tell your sister that you hate the name, and infant loss is so devastating and isolating for parents. No one wants to talk about dead babies, and it can seem for the parents like they\u2019re the only people who are really touched by the loss because most of their loved ones wouldn\u2019t even have met the baby. For her, this may well seem like, \u201cI barely even knew him.\u201d It\u2019s just impossible, and she\u2019ll certainly never be able to look at you quite the same.\n\nI think, honestly, if it were my sister, I\u2019d suck it up and use my nephew\u2019s name. It\u2019ll probably grow on you, and if it doesn\u2019t, hey, you almost never will have to even say it out loud.", "YTA", "NTA. Family traditions suck, and this is one of the main reasons why. You, as parents, should be completely free to choose to name your child however you want to, without anyone dictating what name it should be.", "NAH.  I understand how your sister and family could have big feelings about this.  But I also think you should be able to name your kid what you want.  I honestly HATE family tradition naming of kids.  I knew someone who's family made all the first born females have the same name.  So as a mom you have a name, your daughter gets the same name, her daughter gets that name and so on.  And don't worry, they did it for the boys too!  When this person broke tradition it basically broke the family apart.", "If it's a boy, just give him two middle names. Unless you're from the south where middle names are used (Bobby Sue, Billy Joe, etc...) then no one will ever call him that.", "You are NTA. Remembering someone who has lived for many years by giving a baby their name is honoring them. Naming a baby the same name as one who never got to live their life can be viewed as a happy memory or a sad memory. Sometimes traditions need updating. I don't know how I would feel about it. I'm leaning towards not being comfortable. I can't imagine telling my child they were named after a baby who passed away at two old days. That is so heartbreaking.", "NTA.  You and your husband have the right to name your child whatever you want. However, your family also has the right to be hurt.  Not only is this a tradition, but it's a tradition that honors people the family has lost.\n\nKeep in mind how rarely a middle name is actually used.  Is this something you are willing to create a fight over?  (As you say your husband \"hates\" your family for putting so much pressure on the name.)", "NTA, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair of your family to feel so strongly attached to a tradition that assumes that the person who comes into the marriage is just going to be forced to accept this and not get any say in the naming of their own child. I understand why they are feeling hurt, but it was a pushy tradition to begin with and if it were me personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to use it either.", "Just give your son two middle names; Henry George Philip Smith. Almost nobody will know or care or use it.", "NTA.  The choice of your child's name is yours.

Your baby, your choice\n\nI personally find the tradition a bit morbid, but to each his own I guess.", "Not that it matters, but was Phillip named after anyone?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, NTA. You and your husband can start your own tradition - besides who says his family doesn't have their own naming traditions? A name is also not the only way to honor someone. Name your baby what you want.", "NTA. Say that you don't want your child to grow up with the pressure of living up to his dead cousin's memory. That Phillip died so young that there is nothing negative about him, that you don't want comments about how Phillip would've done x better, etc. It's not fair to the kid, and he deserves his own name.", "NTA for not wanting to continue the tradition but YTA for not shutting it down when your sister brought it up.

Life isn't fair and nothing in life is actually logical. (Here, you logically have every right to name the kid whatever, but logic won't decide this.)\n3. You know the consequences of your actions, both good and bad. \n4. You get to choose. \n\nUnfortunately, the choice here isn't a neutral one. The choice is a kid with a middle name you didn't choose and a satisfied family, or a kid with your choice of middle name and a disappointed family. Those are your options, so choose.

This isn't about you- this is about her grief.\n\nYou and your husband about allowed to name your child whatever you want.\n\nYou can also find a middle ground. For example, you aren't crazy about the name Philip. But maybe you include a P name to honor Philip. (This is something relatively common in my dad's family.) So instead of Philip you use Porter or Patrick or Poll.\n\nOr Philip means horse loving- so you could include a horse inspired name, like Colt, Coulter, Rider.\n\nAt the end of the day, you and your husband have to be happy with your child's name.\n\nAnd everyone has to remember that the kid can change their name at any point.", "Nta however just give the kid 2 middle names, it appeases your family and it\u2019s not like you will ever use it", "NTA. I was named after two dead people and absolutely hated it!", "NTA.\n\n>my husband and I do not want to continue with the tradition.\n\nThat's what matters.", "That tradition is actually quite morbid. I would want the little person to be their own person without any associations with the name.", "It wouldn't be the same as following the tradition for her. My sister loves the tradition. We were always different on where we stood with it. But I think the tradition plays into why for her in a huge way.", "That would not be taken better by my family.

The family doesn\u2019t get a vote, so it is a no. \nI completely understand OP and spouse not wanting to give their child a name they don\u2019t like. And honestly, if they did, once the child was old enough to understand he has the name of his dead infant cousin, it might make him uncomfortable. It\u2019s entirely a different scenario to name a child after an older, deceaseds relative. To name a child after a deceased child seems cruel to the living child.", "OP'S family takes that to a whole new level.", "I agree NTA but \"bad luck\" isn't a thing, we don't live inside of the paranormal activity universe.", "You're just all over this sub today with shit takes, holy shit.\n\nNo.  No one has a right to dictate what you name YOUR OWN CHILD.", "I disagree. Tradition is just peer pressure from dead people (and some still alive). The child and his parents should have a name they are comfortable with.", "You don't need to name a child after the dead to show empathy. Sister's loss sucks big time but why do others need to bend the knee to it?", "OMG, why so salty? They are mom and dad they have their right to choose.

She suffered a loss, but that doesn't mean everything should be done coz of this loss.", "Sis is that you?", "That's not the only reason. I was never fully committed to continuing with it. To me there were always negatives in it. But it's a big factor now considering my husband doesn't like the name either.", "Did you forgot your meds today??

It's not only weird and morbid, it's also imposing on new parents. \n\n>Your sister, who has suffered a devastating loss, asked for this gesture to honor her son's memory, and you're selfishly refusing.\n\nI think the sister is the selfish one here. I get that her kid died, but that doesn't mean op's son has to live with that all his life.", "So op should show support to her by naming her baby something she doesn\u2019t want??? She has the right to choose whatever name for her child that she wishes.", "Honest question: why is honoring past family members morbid? \nNearly all holidays commemorate the death of one or many people.

Can't follow a tradition when the is no space for it.", "Hundred percent agree with this and the NTA. No matter how sad I am about losing someone, nothing in me says that I have any right to dictate what someone else names their child. That's such a bizarre level of controlling to me.
