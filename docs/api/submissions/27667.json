My sister and I both have those middle names. Hers is Patricia after a cousin of our mom's and mine is Denise after my dad's aunt.\n\nAlmost a year ago my sister lost her 2 day old son, Philip. He was the last family member we lost and it was a huge, earth shattering blow for our family.\n\nI found out I was pregnant a few months ago. I waited a while to tell anyone and my sister was the first person we told, privately. When I told her she said it would be nice to have some positive news to focus on and she wanted me to continue the tradition our family keeps and give my baby, if a boy, the middle name Philip. She was so happy about the idea. It surprised me a lot. I would have figured she would not be okay with it. But she wanted it.\n\nThe problem is my husband and I do not want to continue with the tradition. We do not want to give our son the middle name Philip. The name isn't one either of us likes or would ever pick ourselves... We have not announced the sex of our baby yet but my husband and I know we are expecting a boy.\n\nMy family were saying how amazing it will be if my baby is a boy and Philip's name can be carried on... I suggested they wait until we announce the sex and the name before jumping to conclusions. They asked why and I said we were thinking of not continuing with the tradition. My family, and by that I mean my parents mostly, were really upset. My sister was the worst though. She asked why I wouldn't want to honor Philip and why it was him the tradition was getting broken on. She asked if I saw him as meaning so little and I said no, of course not. Then she asked if it was his name and we didn't like it. She said she really hoped it wasn't that. I said we just didn't feel like the tradition was something we wanted to continue.\n\nThe decision has brought up a lot of bad feelings and my sister is especially angry and thinks I'm being insensitive and showing how little I care for my nephew. I feel terrible. She's so angry at me and my parents are unhappy as well. My husband hates them for putting this pressure on us. He said we should be allowed to name our son what we want and we should not be obliged to use a certain name. I never wanted to be an asshole but my family believes I am.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695755447, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16swwi9/aita_for_ending_a_family_naming_tradition_by_not/", "score": 6011, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Turned out we had a boy, but if we had a girl, I would have stuck heavily to my guns.\n\nIts a lot of pressure! Especially for you as its your sisters baby son.

A lot of out-dated, bigoted, and even dangerous ideas and activities are carried on through tradition, passed down from a time when people thought and behaved in very different ways. That's obviously a bad thing, and such traditions should be identified and uprooted. But tradition as a concept is an important part of any culture, whether that culture is a religion, a country, or just a single family lineage. It's a shared experience that's unique to its adherents, and can strengthen one's sense of familiarity and belonging with others who partake in it. If a group follows a certain tradition for long enough, then that tradition can come to be an identifier of that group. At that point, rejection of the tradition can often be interpreted as rejection of the group itself.\n\nMy family has the exact same meal for Christmas every year. The same. Exact. Thing. My dad unearthed some black-and-white silent recordings of his family from wayyyy back, and there are some scenes from Christmastime, and you can see the all the bowls being passed around with the same foods. Recipes unchanged for decades. No one is allowed to bring anything extra. It's considered the peak \"Surname\" Family Tradition, is regarded fondly, and protected ferociously. Every time a newcomer is welcomed, they offer to bring a potroast or lamb or something. They might as well ask to dance on my great-grandma's grave.\n\nYou might roll your eyes and think \"Wow. It's just food. Get over yourself.\" And it would be \"just food\" for me too if not for the tradition behind it. It's the shared experience with those living and gone that makes it special. I remember watching that grainy footage and feeling just indescribably happy that we have been able to keep it going for so long, to carry on a piece of our heritage that my loved ones cared about so deeply. My grandma used to make the meal that my dad took over, and I now make. It's like having her with me in some small way.\n\nAnd again, that's just food. Your family's tradition is a name that is meant to honour someone who most recently passed. Most recently. As in, people in the family are still grieving and missing that person. It's been adopted as part of the grieving process - and *healing* process. It's having a piece of them live on. Take away the history from my family's thing, and all you have is a bunch of pasta and seafood. Take away the history from your family's thing, and it's still an honour wrought with strong emotions, memories, and feeling. Your sister probably found a little bit of solace in the thought that part of her son's memory would live on in your son. Her outbursts are her wrestling with that profound sense of desperate, unfathomable loss.\n\nSo.\n\nIf you use Philip as a middle name, it will help your sister in her grief for her son. It will help her heal. It will create a stronger connection between the two of you, and among the family itself. On the other hand, you don't really like the name.\n\nIf you don't name the kid Philip, your sister will be devastated. Your family will consider it a rejection of a core value that is deeply important to them. They might distance themselves from you, not as an overt punishment meant to manipulate, but because they genuinely don't like you as much. The middle name you choose for him instead might be stupid. On the other hand, you'll like the name you pick better.\n\nEven giving your side more weight because you're the parent, I don't see how you win this one. It's a MIDDLE name. Just give him two.

I'd say the tradition is more meaningful than a middle name of your choosing. You can also give a child multiple middle names. You can have your cake and eat it too on this one.\n\nI'll add, i think most traditions are stupid. While harmless, this one is also kind of stupid. More important than the tradition is that you're sister is really hurting and she'd be beyond delighted to have a small piece of her child carried on. Imagine how youd feel in her position.

My first baby passed shortly after birth a few years ago and now he\u2019s just a memory for my husband and I. No one else will even acknowledge him. It would be so nice to hear his name - hearing it doesn\u2019t magically make me remember him because it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve forgotten. He is always on my mind, and to me, while I wish he were here and alive, it\u2019s not a tragic reminder but a joyful thing to hear his name or anything relating to him.

But this is a reminder regardless of how close we are to their parents of what their names are - it\u2019s the same for all of them and any other little boy of that age. I hear of women discussing how scary it was to be pregnant in 2020 with so much uncertainty, and I want to join in and discuss (those times *were* chaotic!) but I don\u2019t because then the natural questions would be how my child is doing now and I know people are extremely uncomfortable with death in general, especially with death of a baby, so I keep my memories to myself on a daily basis.\n\nStill, even when there have been little boys (one born just a week before mine) have come up and called me \u201cmommy\u201d, it\u2019s been hard but manageable. I don\u2019t know much about the sister but I can empathize and I really hope she\u2019s getting counseling. When there is unresolved trauma after an event like this, it really can turn future interactions bitter unfortunately, and the way she\u2019s reacting to OP seems to hint at this. In her shoes, I personally would be hurt that it *feels* like my baby is getting singled out, but I would also rationally understand that there are many reasons why someone wouldn\u2019t want to continue that tradition at all or with a late baby\u2019s name.\n\nThanks to anyone who made it this far \ud83d\ude05 I wanted to provide some insight here and tbh it was therapeutic to contribute in some way relating to my son.
