It was my best friend and I (both 28) going to celebrate the engagement of our mutual friend from back home. The celebration was at a bar 30 minutes from where we live, so I offered to drive us. He asked if he could bring his GF and I said sure. She then asked about bringing her friend Laura (27F) and I said no problem. Car ride there was fine. So we get there. I congratulate my friend and his fianc\u00e9. We had a few drinks and it was all good vibes. Eventually it was just us four at a table. My buddy came by and said \u201cdidn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see you celebrating a wedding OP\u201d. Me, my buddy and best friend all died laughing. It\u2019s an inside joke to us but we\u2019ve talked about marriage a lot the three of us. We\u2019ve had these deep talks and they both know I\u2019m anti marriage. I won\u2019t go too far into my reasonings as I don\u2019t think they are important here. But I just think men gain very little and the laws are antiquated and are not set in todays society.\n\nSo I cracked back and said \u201cdon\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be here for the next one too\u201d. Once again. Inside jokes with us all. We laughed. Took a pic and buddy kept entertaining. Then Laura goes \u201cthat was incredibly rude. You shouldn\u2019t say that stuff at a party.\u201d I said \u201cit\u2019s an inside joke. It\u2019s not what you think.\u201d Then my buddy explained that I\u2019m anti marriage to her and his Gf. \n\nMy buddies girlfriend didn\u2019t say anything but this girl we were with lost it. Demanding I explain why. I gave her some simple stats and other quips why. But I said simply the lesbian divorce rate is double compared to that of two men\u2019s divorce rate. Which proved to me, that men usually settle whereas women bounce. I respect my money and peace too much. That was the exact statement that set her off. \n\nLaura then starts talking to me. Saying that I\u2019m a weirdo and misogynistic. Me and my buddy left and went outside to defuse the situation. 20 minutes later I came back in. Sat down and we continued the night. About an hour later I went to buy a round. Laura wouldn\u2019t respond whenever I asked if she wanted one. My buddies Gf had to answer for her. And she say she didn\u2019t want anything from a sexist. I said perfect then it was time to leave. \n\nAs we got up I said Laura would need to find another way home. As she didn\u2019t need anything from me a man. She for sure didn\u2019t need a ride home. Laura said it was 30 minutes away. I said Uber was running and left. My friends GF stayed behind with her and me and him left. He said he doesn\u2019t blame me but thinks I should apologize for the sake of his relationship. I said if she\u2019s demanding his friends apologize when they aren\u2019t wrong you are better off ending that type of relationship anyway.

It was my best friend and I (both 28) going to celebrate the engagement of our mutual friend from back home. The celebration was at a bar 30 minutes from where we live, so I offered to drive us. He asked if he could bring his GF and I said sure. She then asked about bringing her friend Laura (27F) and I said no problem. Car ride there was fine. So we get there. I congratulate my friend and his fianc\u00e9. We had a few drinks and it was all good vibes. Eventually it was just us four at a table. My buddy came by and said \u201cdidn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see you celebrating a wedding OP\u201d. Me, my buddy and best friend all died laughing. It\u2019s an inside joke to us but we\u2019ve talked about marriage a lot the three of us. We\u2019ve had these deep talks and they both know I\u2019m anti marriage. I won\u2019t go too far into my reasonings as I don\u2019t think they are important here. But I just think men gain very little and the laws are antiquated and are not set in todays society.\n\nSo I cracked back and said \u201cdon\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be here for the next one too\u201d. Once again. Inside jokes with us all. We laughed. Took a pic and buddy kept entertaining. Then Laura goes \u201cthat was incredibly rude. You shouldn\u2019t say that stuff at a party.\u201d I said \u201cit\u2019s an inside joke. It\u2019s not what you think.\u201d Then my buddy explained that I\u2019m anti marriage to her and his Gf. \n\nMy buddies girlfriend didn\u2019t say anything but this girl we were with lost it. Demanding I explain why. I gave her some simple stats and other quips why. But I said simply the lesbian divorce rate is double compared to that of two men\u2019s divorce rate. Which proved to me, that men usually settle whereas women bounce. I respect my money and peace too much. That was the exact statement that set her off. \n\nLaura then starts talking to me. Saying that I\u2019m a weirdo and misogynistic. Me and my buddy left and went outside to defuse the situation. 20 minutes later I came back in. Sat down and we continued the night. About an hour later I went to buy a round. Laura wouldn\u2019t respond whenever I asked if she wanted one. My buddies Gf had to answer for her. And she say she didn\u2019t want anything from a sexist. I said perfect then it was time to leave. \n\nAs we got up I said Laura would need to find another way home. As she didn\u2019t need anything from me a man. She for sure didn\u2019t need a ride home. Laura said it was 30 minutes away. I said Uber was running and left. My friends GF stayed behind with her and me and him left. He said he doesn\u2019t blame me but thinks I should apologize for the sake of his relationship. I said if she\u2019s demanding his friends apologize when they aren\u2019t wrong you are better off ending that type of relationship anyway.

But changing family dynamics have led to a sea change in the outcome of custody cases.\n> \n> The chances of a father getting full custody are climbing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, fathers made up 20 percent of custodial parents in 2018, up from 16 percent in 1994.\n> \n> Still, full custody for fathers is far less common than full custody for mothers. Whether this is due to bias against fathers is a hotly debated topic. **Overall, many courts prefer awarding joint custody to both parents.**\n> \n> Custody cases don't change much when two dads are at odds. The vast majority of the tips below still apply in this situation.\n> \n> In general, fathers seeking full custody should expect a custody battle. They'll have to build a case that shows their child would benefit from living primarily in their care.\n\n> #Mothers' rights versus fathers' rights\n> Parents essentially have the same rights to custody \u2014 so long as the court recognizes them as the child's legal parents.\n> \n> A mother is automatically the legal parent of any child she gives birth to, regardless of marital status. Unmarried fathers must establish paternity. You should get proof that you're the child's biological father (or legal father) before you pursue full custody. Many states won't even allow you to start a custody case if the child's paternity is unknown.\n> \n> **Courts cannot discriminate against a parent based on gender. Yet the best interest of the child standard is more likely to favor mothers since they are often the primary caregivers for children. For a father in a custody battle, proving parental fitness is key.**\n\nhttps://www.dadsdivorcelaw.com/blog/fathers-and-mothers-child-custody-myths\n\n> #Myth: Fathers Almost Never Get Custody\n> It depends on the applicable definition of \u201cnever,\u201d but generally, this is untrue. The most recent available Census statistics show that fathers represent around one in five custodial parents\u2014an improvement over the 16 percent of custodial parents reported in 1994. However, studies indicate that dads simply do not ask for custody as often as mothers do, and courts generally do not award what is not asked for in that regard.\n> \n> **A Massachusetts study examined 2,100 fathers who asked for custody and pushed aggressively to win it. Of those 2,100, 92 percent either received full or joint custody, with mothers receiving full custody only 7 percent of the time.** Another study where 8 percent of fathers asked for custody showed that of that 8 percent, 79 percent received either sole or joint custody (in other words, approximately 6.3 percent of all fathers in the study). \n> \n> Of course, this leads to the obvious question: Why do so few men attempt to gain custody? While there are multiple factors at play, one to note is that since many men still believe that the court system is inherently prejudiced in favor of the mother, they do not try to seek sole or joint custody, believing it to be a waste of time and money. This contributes to any lingering biases or claims that men care less about their children, which is, in fact, mostly untrue.\n\nI want to see source that says that ***most*** (as in 50+%) FIT fathers actively seek joint custody or primary custody and don't get it.\n\nSo far, I don't believe that the courts are stacked against the fathers. It is the duty of the courts to observe the best interest of the child. They won't punish a dad with no child custody just for the fun of it.", "https://youtu.be/B6JS__PsI0w", "Sadly it is an issue.

All forms of gathering information have there pros and cons, but I feel like looking over all of them helps paint a broader picture atleast. \n\nAlso how can the statement \"Men rarely report it because of the stigma associated\" be proven? How are they gathering data on men who were abused and then did not report it. How do they then gather data on women are abused but not reporting to compare? I feel like we can never no the truth because we usually just rely on some form of self report.\n\nI also saw studies that went into types of 'domestic violence' performed by men and women. Verbal abuse, psychological, manipulative, physical, murder, etc. From what I remember the males usually were worse in forms of violence like stalking and obsessive weird stuff and a lot more likely to be sexually motivated.", "Ohh good point--I do wonder what emotional intelligence levels look like in hetero couples. Like do they generally have lower EQ levels? I would love to eventually see a study on divorced queer couples vs. hetero couples", "100%\n\nI'm currently in a long term relationship and one of the things I was looking for in someone is that we both have the patience and wisdom to move forward in a meaningful and intentional way.

It's really not a great forum for making jokes about how the marriage is doomed.", "> Don't compare it to race. Race was never even brought up.\n\nI thought you were one of those people for whom comparisons and parallels are completely wasted, so I gave another example of \"marriage joke\" that would not be considered sexist and not really funny (\"Oh, flee before he starts treating you like his bangmaid, like husbands do\").\n\nMy point was \"Just people make these jokes and some people laugh, it does not mean it's funny and not sexist\", but you decided to pay attention only to my finger and not to the moon.", "No, only gender was brought up. I guess mean-spirited misogyny is fine with you, but racism crosses the line. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll respond with some kind of angry and spiteful crap about wokeness and how you are so put-upon because you can\u2019t voice your biases as freely as boomers could back in the day.", "I once attended a wedding where, when the couple knelt to receive a blessing, it was revealed the groom had written \"HELP ME\" on the soles of his shoes. I felt so awful for the bride in that moment. She's literally not even married yet and the groom is making jokes about how he's trapped with the old ball and chain. He literally couldn't even wait until after the wedding ceremony to make this belittling joke at her expense. And the bride just took it. I'd have walked the fuck out.", "For someone lecturing others to have a sense of humour and not be so sensitive, you sure get defensive quickly \ud83e\udd23", "You can dish out out but not take it, right, Chad?", "His views aren\u2019t why engagement are bad for him, his views are about how engagement only works out for women, not men.

And why would he then cite off reasons why marriage is bad? Should\u2019ve kept those thoughts to himself.", "Exactly! Same mindset!", "Getting the vibe op has this mindset tbh", "Which is fair enough OP is an arsehole. But shouldn't the friend not rely on said arsehole for a lift back? If I'm at a social function and someone has an opinion I fundamentally disagree with an uber is a small price to pay to not rely on them further.", "Not every queer person is in a open relationship.

No quarter for bigots.", "I agree w the esh part.", "Isn\u2019t women initiating divorce evidence that women are more unhappy in marriage than men? Thus women are fairing worse while men are at least content enough to stay married. \n\nI don\u2019t see what lesbians and gay men have to do with any of it.", "Can you provide some sources for those stats?\n\nAlso, lack of commitment is extremely vague. Are you saying that women start divorces because they lack commitment? Because their partners lack commitment? If one partner cheats and the other files for divorce because of that cheating, who gets the blame in your statistics?", "And you think that 75% is solely on the women who cheat or don't want to remain faithful? If women were cheating more, wouldn't men be initiating divorce more?", "Your comment actually had me laughing, but I can\u2019t figure out the beginning of your acronym. (Edit: got it now!

She *did* say she wanted nothing from him, but he shouldn\u2019t have left her stranded.\n\nIs he an asshole for his sexist views? Yes. But they make me pity him more than being offended by him. He sounds totally like a hurt and scared little boy.", "He could say the same thing about getting married to a man.\n\nAny intimate relationship is going include some conflict.

I don\u2019t want to get married, and some of my friends know that. \n\nHowever, my friends learned that from random Saturday night conversations. I didn\u2019t wait until an engagement party to tell them. And I certainly would still support my friends getting married. \n\nI still really don\u2019t understand why OP had to start rifling off facts that obviously start an argument.

In the test he scored super high. I struggle reading social ques/ others emotions.

Idk", "I have problems finding something for the same reason, I like to take my time. But several partners are like \"We have a first date, so now we have to live together\". \nI just.... Can't.

So yeah, I kinda can guess why lesbians are divorcing more often.", "My friends and family made jokes at MY engagement party about divorce rates.

So it seems like OP is a bit transactional in his thinking, and feels like the scales are a bit tipped.\n\nDoesn't seem to be shy about saying it, probably even cautioned his friend about getting engaged in the first place.\n\nWhat the hell is wrong in this world if we can't have debate without fear of being condemned for our views? It's healthy to challenge views and be challenged by views and opinions.\n\nWill everyone be able to convey them perfectly and cite specific, picture perfect studies and statistics? No.\n\nBut the fact remains, OP was challenged, offered points for consideration (albeit in a relaxed and very laid back setting) and was demeaned, berated and condemned for it.", "Thank you. It could very well just be the people I know and you are right, I shouldn't draw conclusions based on that.", "Women are more unhappy in marriages statistically, actually if i remember correctly women tend to be more unhappy in general than men.

I\u2019d like to point out that people responding to the survey were asked to pick as many reasons for divorce as they wanted to, so that 75% includes many people who selected lack of commitment AND infidelity as the reasons.", "Yes, it is anecdotal, which is why I didn't give stories of it happening in reverse. People tend to focus and remember stuff that could happen to you. So women remember stories of husband's who don't help in the house or with children at and all and men remember stories of men who do everything and get cheated on. What remains important is the facts. Yes, women initiate divorce more, but the one who is losing in a relationship is more likely to file for divorce than the reverse. Why would someone file for divorce if they are getting everything paid, or they don't have to do anything around the house? That points to divorce initiators before the hurt party more than the reverse, because for it to be true in the reverse, you would have to believe that women are initiating divorce at a higher rate out of greed which is laughable. Women are more likely to refuse to put up with bad behavior, as well as feeling stifled in a marriage from the extra burden they have to take. There is a reason married women have a lower lifespan, outside of the facts that married women are more likely to be murdered by their partner than the reverse. \n\nYou seem to be looking at the surface statistics, but not the other statistics that point to the reason, not the correlation.", "He was not there supporting his friend.
