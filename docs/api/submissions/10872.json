Bottom line, this 56 year old man and this 29 year old woman do not work together. Period, unless their is some sort of massive power differential. Why because they are two generations away from each other, not one. They did not live similar childhoods, they did not live similar school experiences, they did not live similar young adult experiences, they did not live similar experiences when joining the work force, they will not live similar experiences when it comes to child bearing or child rearing, they will not live similar experiences with aging parents/family. He was 27 when she was born, a fully grown man in a world that was vastly different to the world she is living in today at 29. \n\nAn example, if they are American, would be 9-11. He was 39 when it happened while she was 8. That was a traumatic lived experience for both, but it didn't shape them in the same ways due to their ages at the time. \nAnother example is that he was born only 3 years after the Civil Rights Act. Regardless of where he grew up in the US, it was still an issue much worse than today, and she can never truly understand. The US was still in Vietnam when he was born. His father could have been a soldier in that war, which would have shaped his childhood. She has no understanding of what it was like during that time. Reading about it and hearing stories about it give no understanding of what it was like to live through it and how it shaped an entire generation of children. \n\nShe has no understanding of what it was like to grow up in the era he did, and as he is 56, it is highly unlikely that he can understand what it's like for her age bracket.\n\nHe is only two years into Gen X, meaning he is barely younger than the youngest Boomers. While she is only 2 years older than the oldest Gen Z. We have generation separation because it is the only way to verbalize how each generation has grown up in vastly different worlds from each other. \n\nSo yes, age gaps are important.", "So now she needs to ask to wash her clothes in her own home because it upsets ur wittle fiance", "When you only talk about how she behaves towards your fianc\u00e9 (rather than towards \u201cus\u201d), that means you\u2019re not doing it together.", "The culture in this generation is weird. There\u2019s a belief that children should always be the most important thing in the world - that parents should be willing to sacrifice anything in order to give their kids a \u201cgood\u201d childhood. But they define a \u201chappy childhood\u201d as though it\u2019s a goal all by itself. \n\nChildren should not have to experience pain or discomfort. Children should not be upset or sad. I think that they want kids to have the childhood they didn\u2019t get to have. They grew up with so much turmoil and chaos and violence.\n\nAnyways\u2026\n\nThey\u2019re in another thread telling a single mom - a woman who had her first child at 15! - to forego an opportunity to get a college degree because her son would have to stay apart from his mom with his grandma during the week. Because they prioritize \u201chappy childhood\u201d above all else, they do believe that parents must - and this is only morally right - sacrifice anything and everything to make their children not only healthy but HAPPY.\n\nSo, for example, if mom cheated on dad and the teenage son says he\u2019ll never forgive her unless she either remarried dad or remains single - they do believe that a lifetime of celibacy is an appropriate and justified penalty for the crime of \u201cbreaking up the family\u201d, not because cheating on a person is wrong, but because it \u201ctraumatized\u201d the kids.\n\nThey absolutely believe that this dad should not date anyone at all unless his daughter would approve. And because they believe in the sanctity of childhood, they believe other things, too.\n\nThey believe that if his daughter lashed out, she had a right to do so. He was a bad dad who put his own happiness above that of his adult daughter. She was a child facing unhappiness; it\u2019s understandable that she\u2019d be upset.\n\nIt\u2019s also the reason they tend to find children so annoying. I\u2019m an adult and I find children generally delightful. But I also don\u2019t mind talking to them. I can politely but firmly ask a toddler to stop kicking my seat, and they do. But if you believe that children are mini-gods, you won\u2019t ever even ASK them to stop being annoying.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also the reason they don\u2019t ever want to have children, and we\u2019re seeing so many of them choose to be child free. They tend to blame parents in particular for failing to protect their children from every unpleasantness, but in the world we now live in, parents can\u2019t do that, not alone, and probably not even then. Life isn\u2019t always pleasant. But if they\u2019re subconsciously measuring a person\u2019s performance as a parent by how pleasant their kid\u2019s childhood was, we\u2019d all fail. And since they know they can\u2019t ever meet their own standards for being a \u201cgood parent\u201d, they opt out, which is a responsible and mature decision.\n\nETA: The worst part is that \u201cparent\u201d trumps all other identities, even \u201cchild\u201d. Like, a 14-year-old with a 29-year-old boyfriend and EVERYONE will be screaming about child sexual abuse and how this 14-year-old is a victim of molestation and grooming. But when the 14-year-old becomes pregnant and becomes a 15-year-old single mom, she\u2019s then an irresponsible parent who was solely responsible for becoming a parent and should\u2019ve used contraception or had an abortion, despite the fact that if she openly had a boyfriend 15 years older than her and the whole town plus her parents knew and WERE OKAY WITH IT, there\u2019s a really high possibility that she didn\u2019t have the knowledge or control over her own reproductive choices. \n\nBut it IS a switch, though. About a third of teen pregnancies are fathered by adult men, so at least a third of teen pregnancies are the result of (at least) statutory rape. And some, I\u2019m sure, resulted from forcible sexual assault. But a 21-year-old girl without kids is still viewed as a kid, whereas a 15-year-old WITH kids is viewed as an adult.", "You're a failure of a parent you know that right?", "And I'm sure your daughter will support you finding a nice retirement home or at home nurse; just not on her dime of course, gotta remember the standards daddy dearest sets", "So you\u2019re teaching her money is more important than her health and any of your family\u2019s happiness.

Just because you can\u2019t realize how few skills your parents were working with until you hit that age. \n\nBy 40, my mom had a 10 year old and an 8 year old. She *seemed* to know what she was doing. As a 42 year old, I am *marginally* more confident, but I still don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m doing. I wing it well, but to think my mom was just winging it with 2 kids in tow???  It almost seems negligent to me. \n\nSo, like, did my parents fuck up?  Sure. Just not in the same way they were fucked up, which is progress. The big parenting innovation of the 80s was \u201cdon\u2019t spank\u201d. They thought they were cutting edge. But therapy to process your childhood trauma?  Never fucking occurred to them. So, really, what was I supposed to expect from them? They did their best, just like I\u2019m doing my best. And I know if I\u2019d have had kids, I\u2019d fuck up in my own way, unintentionally and probably in ways that I wouldn\u2019t realize or know how to fix. \n\nIt just gets easier as you learn more about yourself and your flaws to forgive others for theirs.", "off topic but your fandaniel username combined with the scara icon caught me off guard LMFAO", "And MIL and grandparents", "Yta!  If I was your daughter, I would\u2019ve just left and cut ties with you.  You brought home a gf that\u2019s only 10 years older than your daughter and expects your daughter to listen to your gf?  If your gf really is someone who doesn\u2019t complain, you wouldn\u2019t even be posting this here right now.  Complaining doesn\u2019t need to be in a harsh tone, it could literally be done calmly.  You care about pleasing your gf more than thinking about your daughter\u2019s opinion.  You\u2019re just ruining your relationship with your daughter unless you do something about it.", "Agreed. It was the fianc\u00e9 not cleaning up after herself in the kitchen part that gave it away lool", "No, but 19 is still at an age where I\u2019d expect the parents to be involved in guiding her to make responses, not reactions. I know I was an idiot at 19, anyway, and we have no window into the daughter\u2019s side of this. Was this part of an escalating series of events? Is this a misunderstanding? It seems like OP is trying to impose consequences from the end of the scenario without contemplating the evolution.", "The kid already failed college classes first time around so he's paying for her classes again.  Sounds like the daughter is doing just fine trashing her own life.", "no, I was a bit out.", "This is a house not a college dorm, but ok. I live in a house with other people and I don\u2019t feel the need to time my laundry on my phone.", "Good job on being considerate/having considerate roommates then.", "Yep, it's definitely a hive mind especially in this sub.  This daughter failed her college courses which her father was paying for and now he's paying for those same classes all over again a second time.  I would not have even paid for those classes a second time if she failed them the first time, she probably just parties in college rather than studying.\n\nPeople on here are focusing on the fiance/father age difference without even commenting on how much of a brat the daughter appears to be.  The fiance is almost 30, that's an adult.  The 'child' is also an adult and yet she is acting like a brat when her dad pays for everything.", "Yeah, but now one of those adults has moved into her childhood home.", "OP is clearly disgusting, his daughter knows it. \n\n\nOP: YTA all the way. Threatening to take away her tuition fund because she objects to you being a slimy creep is financial abuse. Sounds like you love to be in control. Does it make you feel like a big boy when you can order young people around?", "WTF does that have to do with anything regarding this post?", "This.  My entire time I was in colllege I waa one of the youngest in the class, even though my birthday is in November.  I did Running Start (also known as college in high school).  I transferred at junior standing with my AA to Washington State at 18 and then did grad school at 20.  I distinctly remember when our distance learning instructor came out from Pullman to meet us all in person halfway through the semester and when we all went out to Billygan's, I was the only one underage (which led to a bit of gentle teasing from my classmates-all older adults- when they found out exactly how old I was).", "I too also dated people much older than me around that age and genuinely wanted to be with them. Looking back, I was incredibly ignorant of the gap between our maturity, but like you I did really like them. I also studied a lot so if I heard them talking about something, I'd do research so I could engage on the topic. Sometimes I felt like a bit of an imposter because I felt like they believed me to be smarter than I actually was, due to how easily I could maintain a conversation with someone much older than me. \n\nI found it had a negative effect on relationships in my life since I struggled to identify with people my own age.", ">  \"you left the window open and a mosquito flew in, if you don't manage to kill it I'm burning the house down\".\n\nABSOLUTELY!", "I don't understand why wet clothes sitting in a basket would be any worse than being left sat in the machine", "Wait, that was the thing that made you snap  She needed the washing machine so *she respectfully put the washed clothes in a basket* like a responsable adult ?! It's even better to put the clothes in a basket than letting them inside the machine where they would become smelly. \n\nIt would have been nicer to inform the fianc\u00e9 but not necessary at all.", "That is assuming that was actually what was happening. I was an honors student all through school. I took advanced courses. I got an academic scholarship from my college that paid over 50% of my tuition. \n\nMy freshman year I didn't party or skip classes. I think I went to one party and drank half a beer. I still failed a class and got a D in another. And the professor was being extremely generous with the D. I was really used to doing well in school with a normal amount of effort. But college required a lot more intense effort. \n\nAnd you had to be self directed to study. Profs weren't giving homework. And when they did it wasn't going to be turned in and graded. So I figured, what's the point??? Turned out the point was the homework was the direction and a means of learning the material. \n\nIt was having to set my own rules and boundaries. Like I can't stay up until 3 am when I have a class at 8. That I can't fuck around all weekend. If I'm going to a basketball game on Friday night then I'm going to have to spend a chunk of Saturday on studying. If there was something both days then their would be studying all Saturday but the hours of whatever I was going to and then ALL day Sunday.\n\nIt took me a bit to put all the pieces together. As I said,  I pretty much bombed my first semester of freshman year. Then you add in the different envirou of the dorm. Learning to live with a roommate; even worse if you don't like each other or are otherwise not compatible. Learning to navigate campus. Trying to make friends and figure out where you fit in the community. Homesickness. There can be an endless list of reasons for why OP's daughter failed her classes without it being her partying and skipping classes.", "Yep, I've done a STEM PhD now but I failed one and almost failed 2 more of my 4 first-semester courses in college even though I didn't drink, didn't live in a dorm and didn't party at all. And then I struggled the next semester and year too, coming close to dropping/failing out multiple times. This was purely because I wasn't used to the lecture learning style or to having classes from 8am until 10pm with no set schedule, some of my classes failed 50-55% of students on purpose to thin the herd, etc. I started getting 4.0s again when I got past intro courses and got used to paying all my own bills, doing all my own cooking, etc.\n\nHaving to live 30+min away from school with some random 29 year old strange woman would have made things worse though, not better.", "The point is more if the daughter stopped her load and removed it, that's an asshole move straight out.\n\nIf she removed an already finished load than we may need more context such as how long the load was done.", "I guess that two adults consenting into a relationship and getting married is the same thing as \"old men leering at younger women\" \n\nIt has nothing to do with being left, what a weird statement. Politics? What? \n\nIt's that you jerked yourself so hard that you're suddenly parroting ancient, patriarchal ideas about adult women not having the agency to make their own decisions in society. You guys see a grown woman dating an older man, and you think \"impossible! No way she isn't being held literal hostage by this man. I must save her, as my extremely limited social experience and values prevent me from understanding that women can make adult decisions.\"", ">I guess that two adults consenting into a relationship and getting married is the same thing as \"old men leering at younger women\" \n\nYou have no idea their relationship is consensual or healthy, you're just making shit up. The **facts** are, relationships that have greater maturity differences are more likely to be abusive. And people who largely differ in age usually differ in maturity. So, using facts instead of our feelings here, it's more likely that this isn't a consensual and healthy relationship\n\n>It has nothing to do with being left. It's that you jerked yourself so hard that you're suddenly parroting ancient, patriarchal ideas about adult women not having the agency to make their own decisions in society\n\nAgain, using buzzwords you don't understand doesn't make you look smarter. Facts aren't patriarchal. The facts are, younger people are usually less mature and experienced than older people.\n\nIn fact, this delusional notion that all adults have 100% control and agency in every situation is the foundation for victim blaming. If you have 100% control and agency, it must be your fault if you are ever manipulated or controlled in any way. All cult members are to blame for joining a cult as adults, since they all had a full understanding of the world and how to navigate it, they must have made a completely conscious choice to join said cult.\n\nAlso, sexism doesn't mean \"someone said something I don't like about one woman \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude22\". Although old men are usually the ones chasing young women (because that's what *actually* happens in a patriarchal society), no one said this only applies to women. There was an AITA post yesterday about a man in his thirties, married to some old woman in her 50s or 60s or whatever, and he was having a conflict with her kids who were in their mid twenties. Even worse, the man started dating her 10 years ago. The entire comment section looked exactly like this one, where people were pointing out the disgusting age gap and how it's an example of grooming. Except, strangely, there were no comments I could find saying \"he was a grown man who could make his own decisions, it's sexist to imply he was less mature and most likely manipulated by this woman\" \ud83e\udd14. It seems like you people only come out when there's a certain agenda you want to push. It's fine to call out the grooming of men, but people shouldn't try to point out the grooming of women. How strange, I wonder why someone would feel the need to insist this so much", "Op is 56 or 59. It was in a comment and now I can\u2019t find it", "I never met a 19 year old who thought people in their 20s were 'old' lmao. Went to lots of college classes with late-20s people in my classes and had lots of late-20s friends and dates around that age. It would be creepier if she was 23 but 29 is still close to the daughter's age.", "The child isn't feeling entitled to control the parent just because they're not dealing particularly well with their discomfort at their parent's relationship.", ">You have no idea their relationship is consensual or healthy, you're just making shit up.\n\nNeither the fuck do you! So what's your point then? \n\nShe's 30 fucking years old. This is so creepy. Stop asserting your weird little authority over adults who can make their own decisions. How the fuck did \"victim blaming\" become a part of this conversation? The fiance is a victim now? You people are deluded. You're blocked. This conversation is over."]}
