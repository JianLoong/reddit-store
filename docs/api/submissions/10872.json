You've convinced yourself that this younger chick is actually into you. \n\nWhen this little girl you're marrying leaves with half your money right before you retire, do you want your kids to still be on your life?\n\nPrepare your answer now.", "Because you are dating someone 10 minutes older then you daughter and you wonder why your daughter finds your child bride a joke.", "I was thinking the same thing. That sounds so fucking evil. The daughter is TA to me lol", "How long had your fiance abandoned them in the machine for?", "And where did she put them when she took them out?", "I realized that I was wrong for that, and asked my daughter to clean up after herself", "Yes we did have a conversation, she said that I was overreacting.", "This is totally untrue \u2026 when I was nineteen, I in no way would have seen someone a decade older than me as a peer. Not in the slightest.", "Lol, comment straight out of r/seducingwomen", "29 is a kid? Please.", "The issue is, my daughter was supposed to be on her college campus when I was dating my fiancee and they didn\u2019t have a chance to meet that much", "*Upvote for unexpected South Park*. I do wonder how old OP is. Presumably at least mid-40s? In any case, fianc\u00e9e is probably closer to the kid's age than to OP's age, unless you're 39 or younger, OP? But OP doesn't see why this could possibly be relevant to the interpersonal conflict here \ud83e\udee0", "yup", "Right? It screams from the page. Daughter age \u2248 Fiance  age.\n\nAnd OP omitting the ages in the post and dodging my question confirms it. He *knows* that's the problem. (He even called them both \"childish\") And he knows we'll tear him a new asshole if he admits it.\n\n\nEDIT In her 20s, of course", "How is 29 a \u201clittle girl\u201d? that\u2019s just rude and dismissive of a WOMAN.", "She put them in a basket not the dryer. I think she should have had a conversation with my fianc\u00e9 if she wanted to move her stuff.", "How many times did you ask her? If the kitchen is nearly constantly too dirty to use.", "Were you overreacting? Or was it a nice civil talk between adults?", "If the conversation was \u201cstraighten up or I cut off college\u201d then yes you were overreacting.\n\nIf it was \u201chey, we\u2019ve noticed these things and want to know why you\u2019ve changed. You didn\u2019t do this before so I want to know if you\u2019re ok with things.\u201d Then continued in a peaceful and respectful manner to get to the bottom of things, NTA.\n\nBut thus far this sounds like you jumped straight to punishment instead.", "TBH nobody is behaving well here, are they?", "She was correct.", "Did you ever once ASK your daughter how she felt about your girlfriend and whether she would be okay with her moving into your joint household? \n\nMy money is on you just informing her what would happen.", "I think that could depend on if the daughter knew the fianc\u00e9 before dad started dating her. When I was 19 I worked in a bar with people who were ten years or more older than me who I was and still am friends with.", "29 isn\u2019t a child, But the 29 year old and the 19 year old probably have more in common then a 29 year old and what I\u2019m assuming is a man in his 40s", "No. That is NOT the issue. Read the feedback. Read the room.", "Sure.\n\nYour story is a regular one on this sub. The basic condensed version is:   I have a much younger girlfriend, and sex with her is all that matters.", "\u201c20s\u201d you can\u2019t lump a 29 year old in the same basket as a 20 or 21 year old. Blows my mind people all over this sub do that on a fairly regular basis.", "OR and hear me out here, your fianc\u00e9 could have moved her own laundry to the dryer before someone else needed to use the washing machine.", "It\u2019s not like she removed them mid cycle! She placed them in a basket, and yeah okay she could have mentioned it but if she\u2019s that pissed off right now then of course she won\u2019t say anything", "How long were the clothes in the washer? If it were me I wouldn\u2019t know what could be put in the washer for someone else\u2019s clothes. I would have done the same, especially if I needed to do laundry and they weren\u2019t home", "Here\u2019s a clue: Your daughter has no desire to have a conversation with the woman you brought in to occupy her household. Ever.", "She was asked several time by me and my fianc\u00e9", "Agree \u2026 it depends on the situation \u2026 but people aren\u2019t all the same way at certain ages. I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s always considered the be all end all of a post, instead of focusing on the behaviours.", "I don\u2019t really have those details. But her removing my fianc\u00e9\u2019s clothes from the washer was enough for me to have a conversation with her because it wasn\u2019t her first time doing something to get a reaction form my fianc\u00e9", "There's a constant problem. She was asked once or twice by your fiance. As you're only calling it several altogether, I'm going to guess that you could actually say the number of times you've mentioned it to her. Step up. Be the parent. Stop making your young girlfriend try to parent someone she's only 10 years older than.", "Oh that\u2019s true, I do understand where the ages could be relevant in this situation though, and I don\u2019t think the fianc\u00e9 or dad should think that she has any authority over his daughter!", "You don\u2019t know the important details and you went off with threats? That laundry could have been there for hours!", "Can you maybe... state the reasons WHY your daughter seems to dislike your fianc\u00e9e so much?", "The clothing sitting in the basket is no worse for the clothes than sitting in the washer. I\u2019m guessing if your daughter had moved the clothing to the dryer, your fianc\u00e9 would be complaining about your daughter ruining her clothes by drying them on wrong setting or putting something in the dryer that she needed to hang up. If you share a washer, it\u2019s your responsibility to remove your clothes when you\u2019re done washing them so other people can use the washer.", "I\u2019m not aware of any reasons for my daughter to dislike my fianc\u00e9e because she\u2019s an amazing person."]}
