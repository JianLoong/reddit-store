My (22) boyfriend, Damien found out that I had these and asked me if he could borrow them. It didn\u2019t cross my mind to ask him why he needed them since he borrows things often and returns them. That happened in January and since then I\u2019ve completely forgotten that he never returned them. My (19f) sister started her sophomore year of college a few months ago and the other day she asked if I could send her pictures of my old textbooks and mail the ones she needed to her. I said sure before I went to grab them only to remember that Damien had them. I called him to ask for them back and he told me he sold them on some app. I was so upset and demanded that he gave me the money he made from them. He told me that he only made $210 and he\u2019d already spent that money back in January. In the heat of the moment I told him to pay me back or I would sue. I didn\u2019t seriously mean it, I was just upset.\n\nHe told me I was childish for even thinking about suing him over that small amount and that I wasn\u2019t using the textbooks and never even asked about them again. I told him that it doesn\u2019t matter because they were mine and I only let him borrow it, he\u2019s not allowed to sell something he knows doesn\u2019t belong to him. He told his mother about our argument and yesterday she started blowing up my phone, calling me broke and crazy for trying to sue her son. She then offered me the $200 on behalf of her son and I declined telling her that it was mainly about the principle and not the amount. She said that I made a big deal out of nothing and that I should grow up. I called her an old hag and told her to hold her son accountable. \n\nHe broke up with me and posted all of this on his instagram story. It died down for a few hours but soon enough our mutual friends were giving their opinions and everyone thinks I took it too far.

It\u2019s a good thing that you broke up.\n\nIt\u2019s not childish or crazy to be angry and want the money he got from stealing and selling your stuff.

Basically he took your property under false pretence and sold it. Cashed in the money (might be more than 210)and didn't plan on telling you. This is call stealing and was premeditated, clear and simple. He also broke your trust, sent his mum after you. Then posted on Instagram to humiliate you (if you are going to sue take screenshot of that and add it to the claim). To top it up, it now costs your sister a lot more money for textbooks, money that she could have save or reused for something else.", "Tell him it's okay he spent the $210 he earned, you'd be happy to take any $210.  My God, what a stupid thing to say.  That's like me borrowing $20 for lunch and when asked for the money back later, me replying,  \"but I spent it on lunch.\"", "NTA, he is a thief", "Nta- college textbooks are expensive. It doesn't matter what he got from them; it matters what they're worth.  I fully supports you following through in small claims court. You didn't deserve that and he deserves to be held accountable since his mama never taught him morals", "NTA are you sure he never left anything at your place that you could \u201csell\u201d?", "NTA, you\u2019re the person lucky enough to get out of a relationship where a boy tells on his gf to his mother.  What a clown.  And the mother has the audacity to call you?  Who do these people think they are?  Consider yourself lucky, no matter what \u2018cost\u2019 you think you paid.  On another note\u2026get help with that hoarding thing, you\u2019ll be happier.", "NTA. Still sue tho", "NTA. What he did? That would be theft. The thief is almost always the AH.", "Sometimes I wonder if people actually understand the process of suing someone. \n\nOP is NTA, but in my state, just to file a lawsuit to sue another party is more than the amount you\u2019d be suing for. ($250) \n\nIf you don\u2019t hire representation, which is expensive, you\u2019ll probably lose. If he hires representation, and OP doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll definitely lose. \n\nIn some cases, you\u2019ll wait months for an out come, and even if you win, that does NOT automatically mean you\u2019ll receive the money.\n\nSure, if you win, you could get your filing fee back and maybe even representation fees. But, in the end, it\u2019s a hassle, a pain in the ass, and a frustrating process. Not trying to discourage, it\u2019s a shame it can work this way, but it might not be worth going that route unless you\u2019re prepared for it to almost be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. \n\nBut, I sincerely hope you receive your money and his actions were no doubt the actions of an AH....", "NTA. You ex is a grifter and a thief. I had this happen with a friend who wanted to borrow an expensive, large dog house. When a year later I needed it, they had sold it. That friendship blew up. It may hurt now but your ex is very dishonest and immature by posting on social media. You dodged a bullet. Block him, his mom, his friends on your phone and social media.", "NTA", "Esh. I know in the middle of arguments it's hard to think with a straight head. \nBut \nhe said he didn't have it, u said you'd sue for the money, \nso \nmom offers money and u refuse. \nThat's fine,\nBut then u made a fuss for nothing", "Not even if I cry to my mommy about it and send her after my adult friend??", "She refused to receive any financial compensation though and text books depreciate in value significantly for used. It's the same concept as you can't sue for $700 for a very old iphone. She should see how this affects her chances of winning in small claims. If it's a matter of principle sure but could risk just losing even more money", "She is owed replacement value of the used books, so honestly it could be that the judge says he owes her only say $20.  Who knows, but surely it won\u2019t be an amount over the $200.", "He\u2019s an outright thief.", "I bet the bf got more than $200 for those books.  My gut tells me that.  Op should go and find out.....then go to thr police.", "He\u2019s a thief. He stole.", "Although, I think his admitting how much he made selling them might make a difference to the replacement cost evaluation.", "And she sucks too. She got all huffed out about the principle of the matter and now she has nothing. They weren't worth more. They aren't valuable collectors items. They have next to no sentimental value. She was keeping them because she's an admitted hoarder.\n\nShe should have taken the money, cut him out of her life and moved on.", "You missed OP\u2019s point entirely. Have a day.", "And what point was that? Stealing is wrong? Well no shit. What does she want, to parade him through the streets naked, ringing a shame bell? Saying she would sue him over 200$ was laughable. She has done exactly nothing to resolve this issue and even worse let the AH get away with it scot free.", "Shes not just owed what he sold them for, she's owed the full cost of replacing the textbooks which is likely much more than 200$ if he sold them cheap.", "Old textbooks...first of all, why in God's name would she want them back. He shouldnt have stolen or sold them but they were completely pointless. Getting 200 for them was a bonus instead of throwing them away one day when you clean out your house. Second if some steals your old car, you don't get a new one as a replacement. She would at best get the price of what they would cost at a used book store.", ">Old textbooks...first of all, why in God's name would she want them back. He shouldnt have stolen or sold them but they were completely pointless.\n\nIf they were pointless and to old to be relevant at school why would OPs sister be asking for her used books? \n\nCurious on how you're more knowledgeable about these books than OP. Can you tell me how many new editions have came out for each of these books rendering them obsolete?"]}
