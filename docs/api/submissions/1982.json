Not only do you need to refuse anymore free taxi service, you need to get this person out of your house before you will  have to legally evict him.  he is playing you hard, he doesn't understand 'no' when you say it, he keep needling at you til you give in.  Is this how you want to live your life?  Say NO, give him 24 hours to pack up and leave.  This is not your friend.  This is a USER.  His  aquarium is in your home?????", "Nta. But rides and sleepovers stop TODAY. you have to put you first", "NTA - Tell him you are not going to give him rides ever. He is seriously taking advantage of you.

It\u2019s time to set boundaries because this \u201cfriend\u201d is grossly taking advantage of your kindness. I\u2019d kick that mf to the curb until he starts treating you like a friend instead of a chaperone", "You WNBTA to tell him that but he has learned if he pesters you enough you give in. So either give up any pretence of \"pretending to say no\" and giving in or say no and stick to your guns (and maybe hide your keys)", "NTA for being put out with this. You need to stop giving in though. Is he reimbursing you for gas? He needs to grow up and figure out how to get himself to and from work", "NTA, don't let yourself be taken advantage of like this", "NTA\n\nBut YWBTA if you continue to let him manipulate you into doing what he wants with no regard for what you want.\n\nHe doesn't sound like much of a friend.

If his life dictates he needs to many car rides he needs to invest in one himself. \n\nBe firm, set clear boundaries then you simply need to stick to them.", "ESH. your friend sucks for his behavior.

Him whining is a better alternative than you not being able to live your own life and pay for all of his transportation costs (which I\u2019m sure aren\u2019t insignificant). What a jerk.", "So, you've taught him how much nagging he has to do before you give in. Now you get to decide which is worse, giving in to his nagging and being his private chauffeur or actually saying no to him. You need to face up to the fact that nothing is going to change until you say no. Your mooch has no reason to change, he is getting what he wants, and he clearly doesn't care about your time and expenses. So, it is up to you to change. Get therapy to learn how to stop being a doormat (it will come really handy in life, trust me,) and in the meantime, block him on your phone and only unblock him when you actually have time to drive him everywhere. That'll help some until you grow a spine. And no, YWNBTA if you told him you're nto giving rides, period.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Say \u201cHey, I need to address something with you, can you spare a few minutes to talk?\u201d Then explain how you being his taxi is not working for you at all, and how him pressuring you to change your mind once you say no is not okay. You have your life you need to manage and it\u2019s not your responsibility to manage his also. The convenience you provide him shouldn\u2019t interfere with your life, *and it is interfering.* So let him know that he needs to find another primary mode of transportation, and that he can *ask* you as a backup but once you say no, that means no. Then you need to stop giving in. Say how you already talked about it and nothing more needs to be said. If the plants die, then they die, and it\u2019s his fault because those are his plants. Don\u2019t let him guilt you into things being your fault or your responsibility. Heck, I would go as far as leaving the house and going to a coffee shop for a few hours or a friend\u2019s place if he kept on about needing a ride.

Sorry if that wasn't clear. Before coming to my house, he noticed his plants were having a hard time. So we had to go to the pet store then go to his house and come back at my house after. I don't really have an issue with him being at my house. The thing that bugs me is that he's in my room and sometimes I just want to be alone. I think we just grew up differently, his mom always make dinner and gave him rides whenever he asked (she can't anymore because she started working again). Our household is different. We rarely eat together and it's more like eat whenever you're hungry situation. Prior to having a car I almost never asked for rides and would take the bus.", "This, he needs to start paying for rent and gas or needs to return to his own place. He was aware of his own transportation limitations but took the job out of his area anyway.\n\nNTA", "Tbh I don't think he realizes his behaviour but I'm very non confrontational so I have a hard time telling ppl how I feel.", "He can buy a non-electric bike.

My little sister is way from home for two weeks and I told him he could take her room while she's away so we both get privacy. I mentioned the fact that I was not a taxi service when he kept insisting on having a ride and I got really annoyed. I gave in this time because he said he'd buy me a milkshake and I really wanted one.  I agree that he could be using me, however, I don't think he realizes it or at least I hope so(i mentioned in one comment that we didn't grew up the same way, so maybe that's it).", "Thank you for the advice!

I'm a French Canadian and we use the term lift instead of rides haha. No he doesn't pay for gas. It's hard to get him to pay for anything really. Just recently we went to a cottage for a Halloween party. It was 100$ to go but free for girls (yes, it's sexist but if i can save 100$, I won't say no). He said it was ridiculous to make him pay when he brought his own stuff (drinks/snacks) BUT he then took the room of someone who was paying with his girlfriend and I thought that was a very shitty move because the guy had to sleep on a couch. I suggested to split evenly between me him and his girlfriend. I asked him multiple times but has not given me the money yet.", "I live in the suburbs and he lives in a small city 20 min away from me. He has to take 3 different buses to come to my house.", "Note:  You Are Not His Mom.  He Is Not Your Child.  If he doesn't realize he's an adult, does not realize that other people's homes are to be respected, he has a problem.  Pls don't make excuses for another adult.  He is a GUEST in  your home.  \n\nHe has no business invading your bedroom/personal space. He can sleep on the floor, the couch.  He can entertain himself. It doesn't matter how he grew up; what matters is how YOU want things in YOUR home.  \n\nIf he doesn't understand basic manners, courtesy, then it is time someone nicely sat him down and told him.  If he is not mature enuf to understand this, he needs to go back home to mommy and take the bus (I don't care how many hours it takes).", "You have to put your foot down and DON'T CHANGE YOUR MIND because if you give in uou are screwed. I would tell him no more staying overnight either because he has more access to you and you will have him putting more pressure on you.", "He realizes it, he knows exactly what he's doing TO you.  \nHe's playing you like a fiddle and it's high time the music stops.", "He can freakin' walk!", "You\u2019re an adult, as is he. Please, you need to put yourself first as if you don\u2019t, no one will. You can still be caring, and helpful to others when you are willing but your needs still come first. There are gentle ways of still being firm to hold true to your boundaries and protect yourself (whether it\u2019s giving rides, or always being over in your space). He also has choices so do not ever think that you giving him a ride is the only option available to him. As others have said, he\u2019s an adult and can choose to learn how to drive himself or time his appointments around the bus system.  \n\nYou also need to recognize that when you draw a line in the sand and inform him of this, when he continues to push because something benefits him (only), it\u2019s not respectful or ultimately to your friendship. True friends aren\u2019t users, it\u2019s give and take.", "There\u2019s no \u201ccould\u201d be using you.

He prioritized his time on the bus as being more important than your time studying.   \n\nHe doesn\u2019t stop because he doesn\u2019t care enough about you to change what he\u2019s doing    \n\nIF this is an \u201cupbringing\u201d thing -  Do you have the time and capacity to retrain someone who\u2019s default setting is on \u201cselfish\u201d ?  (Spoiler, it\u2019s a long shot that he can change this) \n\nOP.   Put a higher value on yourself than a milkshake.", "I agree with you. And I told him that I wouldn't always be there to entertain/distract him. I often go at my boyfriend's while he's there and it gives me a break. Thank you, you made me realize stuff:))", "22 is exactly the age when you start realizing some of your friends haven\u2019t learned appropriate boundaries as they moved into adulthood. \n\nI have BPD and I\u2019ve struggled with identifying toxic or inappropriate behavior/boundaries in others. An exercise I\u2019ve found helpful is to put the shoe on the other foot. Would you ever dream of feeling so confident taking advantage of him the way he takes advantage of you? And even though you wouldn\u2019t, what would happen if you did? He wouldn\u2019t put up with that from you, but for some reason it\u2019s ok when he does it to you. \n\nNow you\u2019re boundaries have been pushed SO FAR you\u2019re asking if you\u2019re TA for not doing what you originally said you wouldn\u2019t. A relationship with a person who you spend the majority of your time and energy reestablishing and reinforcing boundaries is exhausting. That\u2019s why you\u2019re exhausted by it. \n\nThis is exactly how one ends up in an abusive relationship. I say that because I encourage you to watch out for these behaviors in your romantic relationships as well. Predators/abusers end up with people like you and me bc people that have healthy boundaries disconnect from those that disrespect boundaries pretty quickly. Those people push our boundaries until we think we\u2019re an asshole for having any at all. \n\nBest of luck to you, man.", "But, so far, you HAVE been there for him, he just has to bitch to you enough and you give in. That has to stop, now.", "Thank you so much this is so helpful"]}
