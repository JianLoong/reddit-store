We were very close at one point, but grew apart as we got older. P withdrew into himself while I became more outgoing, and eventually, whenever I would see him, it would be awkward and we would hardly be able to hold a single conversation just because of our different personalities and interests.\n\nP is transgender (FTM) and after transitioning, he became much more confident and happy with himself. We never became quite as close as we were in childhood, but I am genuinely happy that he\u2019s in a better place. He transitioned in college and around the time, got into stand-up comedy as a way to put himself out there.\n\nI have a wedding coming up and I was talking to my family about reception speeches, and P asked if he could do one. I said yes since we\u2019ve known each other since childhood and were very close at one point, but when the speech was written and sent to me and my fianc\u00e9, we quickly agreed that we didn\u2019t want it at our wedding\n\n.The speech was essentially a stand-up comedy act, with my fianc\u00e9 and I as the punchline. It opened with \u201cWe are all gathered here today to witness YET ANOTHER union of a cis-het couple, because none of us have seen enough of that in our lives\u201d, and went on to make fun of me, how \u201cyoung\u201d I\u2019m getting married, my husband, his job, our friends, our interests, and how \u201cbasic\u201d our relationship is. There were some cute childhood memories sprinkled in, but they would immediately be followed up with some variation of \u201cbefore OP became popular\u201d. The speech concluded with half-hearted well wishes and \u201cI hope that I find what OP and her fianc\u00e9 have. Ok, well, maybe not that exactly\u201d.\n\nI told P that the speech felt like it was making a joke out of our wedding and to please cut out the parts making fun of us. He said that those parts were the majority of the speech, and they were just jokes and we would have the whole day to feel good about ourselves. I told him that if he wasn\u2019t cutting those parts out, he would not speak at my wedding.\n\nP\u2019s mom reached out to me and said that P uses public speaking to come out of his shell, and that I saw what happened to him when \u201chis voice was silenced\u201d all those years ago. P also told me that not allowing him to make jokes about cis-het people is bigoted and that he does comedy to recover from his depression, so he needs this opportunity. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH for calling out P\u2019s speech, but barring him from speaking altogether may have been extreme.

Your wedding is not an open mike comedy club. Wrong event.", "some people who were bullied early in life like to become bullies themselves, because it makes them feel powerful to fill the past pain of feeling helpless. they use their past as a gotcha to paint themselves as the true victims and invalidate the people they're hurting.\n\nit does not matter in this context if P was bullied. it does not matter in this context if P was silenced. you said you were uncomfortable, and he is trying to pull the bigot card to get his way. he is bullying you now. he is silencing you now.\n\nP does not get to demand courtesies of you, that he is taking an active role in attempting to deny you.\n\nin conclusion, tell him to f off\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWedding speeches shouldn't be a roast or a political platform.", "I\u2019d be very tempted to tell P and his mother not to come at all if that\u2019s their attitude. This is your wedding day and they\u2019re trying to make it about P.\n\nI\u2019m all for a few jokes in a wedding speech but this just sounds like a blatant attempt to pass their jealousy off as \u2018a joke\u2019\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nIt doesn't even matter that the speech is horrible, no matter why you chose to not have this speech happen you would always be NTA. It's your wedding, your choice. He does not get a say in it.", "NTA. Tell him and his mother that he is perfectly welcome to read his speech to his therapist who they are paying for but to keep his issues out of your wedding which you are paying for.", "NTA. Your wedding isn't an opportunity for him to come out of his shell. It's a day to celebrate you and your partner. Period.", "He can go to open mike night instead.", "NTA", "NTA! Cut P\u2019s speech entirely because even if he agrees to your face he will still do it and probably worse, I think you are being very sensible about what he is trying to pull but your weddding isn\u2019t a comedy club and you are disappointed that he is only doing this to try and further his career", "NTA. It\u2019s a wedding, not a stand up comedy show and P sounds insufferable.", "NTA. Your event is not his opportunity.", "As an ftm trans man, I apologize for our community on this persons behalf. You are definitely not wrong and this person has a lot to still figure out. I like to call these people baby trans. Know who they aren\u2019t but not yet who they are. NTA", "NTA. Your wedding isn\u2019t an open mic night.", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding, your rules. It's a day to celebrate the couple and their relationship, not to mock them. If he wants to actually recover from depression, please get therapy.\n\nAlso if your friend cannot make people laugh without having to make an ass out of anyone that's not them or their sexuality.. it doesn't sound like a fun stand up comedy", "This person clearly still has issues and they need to understand is that ruining an innocent wedding is not gonna help them heal from their trauma and insecurities. NTA.", "Not wanting to be mocked at your wedding doesn't make you a bigot. It makes you a sane person who understands how weddings work and remembers whose wedding it is. NTA", "NTA - tell P he can do his act for his mom.", "NTA, and honestly I\u2019d consider revoking his invite. A wedding is not a comedy club, send him a link for open mic nights in his area.", "NTA.\n\nHe can do that elsewhere, what an asshole to use your wedding to make himself feel better. Like making fun of your relationship is what brings him joy. \n\nI understand comedy, but there's a time and place and you've expressed that your wedding wasn't it. He can't get his kick elsewhere and if he gets upset, maybe he just doesn't need to come.", "NTA. A wedding is not the place for this poor soul to work out their issues with heteronormativity.", "Nta. You don't need this person and their hatred at your wedding.", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t even be invited at this point.", "NTA.\n\n\"Friend\" is playing reverse uno on bigotry.", "NTA. You should never be belittled at your own wedding. P shouldn't use his sexuality as an excuse to be an asshole.", "NTA. Time to cut him off. You cannot use someone\u2019s wedding to poke fun at them. It\u2019s a fucking wedding, not a roast. Him and his mom can get fucked because it\u2019s not their wedding.\n\nEdit: correction", "NTA. It sounds like he's had his issues and comedy is a good outlet for that, but a wedding isn't the time or place.

I would reconsider even letting him come to the wedding in case he tries to stand up unsolicited and still talk his trash (give his speech as he calls it).", "Yup. So P\u2019s mom says:\n\n> he does comedy to recover from his depression, so he needs this opportunity.\n\nFine. I\u2019m glad comedy helps with his depression but OP\u2019s wedding is not P\u2019s therapy session.\n\nI think a few jokes about one or both of the couple is fine and expected (I\u2019m reminded of the speech at my stepson\u2019s wedding where his wife\u2019s sister listed things wife had thrown at her when they were kids - had us all laughing at the start of the speech with that before making us all cry when she talked about how they loved and supported each other and how my stepson loved his wife) but P\u2019s speech sounds like a full-on roast of the couple and the concept of \u201ccis-het weddings\u201d in general with no redemption arc to the speech to bring it back on track.\n\nThis wedding is not the time and /u/aitapweddingspeech is NTA", "Dude needs another outlet because the wedding is a celebration of OP and her future husband's union, not his coming out party.", "Yep I\u2019d tell him it\u2019s a wedding not a roast and then I\u2019d call his mom and read the entire thing to her.", "This needs an award and to be at the top.", "What was the fallout with your siblings?", "Transphobic asshole alert!"]}
