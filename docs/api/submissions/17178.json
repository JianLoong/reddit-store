We were very close at one point, but grew apart as we got older. P withdrew into himself while I became more outgoing, and eventually, whenever I would see him, it would be awkward and we would hardly be able to hold a single conversation just because of our different personalities and interests.\n\nP is transgender (FTM) and after transitioning, he became much more confident and happy with himself. We never became quite as close as we were in childhood, but I am genuinely happy that he\u2019s in a better place. He transitioned in college and around the time, got into stand-up comedy as a way to put himself out there.\n\nI have a wedding coming up and I was talking to my family about reception speeches, and P asked if he could do one. I said yes since we\u2019ve known each other since childhood and were very close at one point, but when the speech was written and sent to me and my fianc\u00e9, we quickly agreed that we didn\u2019t want it at our wedding\n\n.The speech was essentially a stand-up comedy act, with my fianc\u00e9 and I as the punchline. It opened with \u201cWe are all gathered here today to witness YET ANOTHER union of a cis-het couple, because none of us have seen enough of that in our lives\u201d, and went on to make fun of me, how \u201cyoung\u201d I\u2019m getting married, my husband, his job, our friends, our interests, and how \u201cbasic\u201d our relationship is. There were some cute childhood memories sprinkled in, but they would immediately be followed up with some variation of \u201cbefore OP became popular\u201d. The speech concluded with half-hearted well wishes and \u201cI hope that I find what OP and her fianc\u00e9 have. Ok, well, maybe not that exactly\u201d.\n\nI told P that the speech felt like it was making a joke out of our wedding and to please cut out the parts making fun of us. He said that those parts were the majority of the speech, and they were just jokes and we would have the whole day to feel good about ourselves. I told him that if he wasn\u2019t cutting those parts out, he would not speak at my wedding.\n\nP\u2019s mom reached out to me and said that P uses public speaking to come out of his shell, and that I saw what happened to him when \u201chis voice was silenced\u201d all those years ago. P also told me that not allowing him to make jokes about cis-het people is bigoted and that he does comedy to recover from his depression, so he needs this opportunity. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH for calling out P\u2019s speech, but barring him from speaking altogether may have been extreme.
