We never became quite as close as we were in childhood, but I am genuinely happy that he\u2019s in a better place. He transitioned in college and around the time, got into stand-up comedy as a way to put himself out there.\n\nI have a wedding coming up and I was talking to my family about reception speeches, and P asked if he could do one. I said yes since we\u2019ve known each other since childhood and were very close at one point, but when the speech was written and sent to me and my fianc\u00e9, we quickly agreed that we didn\u2019t want it at our wedding\n\n.The speech was essentially a stand-up comedy act, with my fianc\u00e9 and I as the punchline. It opened with \u201cWe are all gathered here today to witness YET ANOTHER union of a cis-het couple, because none of us have seen enough of that in our lives\u201d, and went on to make fun of me, how \u201cyoung\u201d I\u2019m getting married, my husband, his job, our friends, our interests, and how \u201cbasic\u201d our relationship is. There were some cute childhood memories sprinkled in, but they would immediately be followed up with some variation of \u201cbefore OP became popular\u201d. The speech concluded with half-hearted well wishes and \u201cI hope that I find what OP and her fianc\u00e9 have. Ok, well, maybe not that exactly\u201d.\n\nI told P that the speech felt like it was making a joke out of our wedding and to please cut out the parts making fun of us. He said that those parts were the majority of the speech, and they were just jokes and we would have the whole day to feel good about ourselves. I told him that if he wasn\u2019t cutting those parts out, he would not speak at my wedding.\n\nP\u2019s mom reached out to me and said that P uses public speaking to come out of his shell, and that I saw what happened to him when \u201chis voice was silenced\u201d all those years ago. P also told me that not allowing him to make jokes about cis-het people is bigoted and that he does comedy to recover from his depression, so he needs this opportunity. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH for calling out P\u2019s speech, but barring him from speaking altogether may have been extreme.

All because he needed to be mean to OP", "First time?", "Not just misgendering - also how exactly does it say transition didn't work out when OP says the exact opposite?\n\nI'd say that poster and the wedding problem guy fell of the same tree: Push an agenda and damn any facts or any other people. \n\nUnpleaseant, whether cis or trans.", "NTA please don't pay a fortune for this guy to ruin it. He wants to speak, he can host his own darn wedding. It's not his \"right\" to ruin someone else's day (just becauses hes suffered in the past doesnt give him a free pass to make you suffer at an event youre paying thousands upon thousands of dollars for just so he can publicly humiate you). He's got freedom of speech but you've also got freedom of who you want to invite, and 100% you should un-invite this jerk who is NOT going to be happy for you, regardless if he speaks or not. The only person he cares about is himself, he is literally around ZERO percent happy for you or your partner, and that's not the kind of person you want at what is meant to be the happiest day of your life!\n\nEdit: you should 100% send his mum this thread to show her how short-sighted she is being.\nEdit 2: oops I thought I posted this on the main part, didn't realise it was tacked onto a different comment sorry", "While I agree the wedding is not the place for this, that battle has absolutely not been won. My country doesn't have gay marriage. In fact, gay marriage is legal in fewer than 20% of countries around the world. \n\nI don't know where OP is from, and maybe gay marriage is legal there, but to claim that fight has been won is Western-centric and plainly wrong.", "[deleted]", "Yeah I really want someone slagging me off at my wedding and pointing out all my historical faults and teenage angst.

He is being mean", "Really? \n\nI\u2019m Australian. \n\nI was shocked and disgusted that America passed same sex marriage BEFORE Australia. \n\nI honestly thought it was legal everywhere. \n\nI do know some businesses / people are pushing back. Bigoted assholes. \n\nBut I honestly thought same sex marriage was federally legal in the US. \n\nSorry. \n\nP is still an asshole for trying to use OPs wedding as a platform.
