We were very close at one point, but grew apart as we got older. P withdrew into himself while I became more outgoing, and eventually, whenever I would see him, it would be awkward and we would hardly be able to hold a single conversation just because of our different personalities and interests.\n\nP is transgender (FTM) and after transitioning, he became much more confident and happy with himself. We never became quite as close as we were in childhood, but I am genuinely happy that he\u2019s in a better place. He transitioned in college and around the time, got into stand-up comedy as a way to put himself out there.\n\nI have a wedding coming up and I was talking to my family about reception speeches, and P asked if he could do one. I said yes since we\u2019ve known each other since childhood and were very close at one point, but when the speech was written and sent to me and my fianc\u00e9, we quickly agreed that we didn\u2019t want it at our wedding\n\n.The speech was essentially a stand-up comedy act, with my fianc\u00e9 and I as the punchline. It opened with \u201cWe are all gathered here today to witness YET ANOTHER union of a cis-het couple, because none of us have seen enough of that in our lives\u201d, and went on to make fun of me, how \u201cyoung\u201d I\u2019m getting married, my husband, his job, our friends, our interests, and how \u201cbasic\u201d our relationship is. There were some cute childhood memories sprinkled in, but they would immediately be followed up with some variation of \u201cbefore OP became popular\u201d. The speech concluded with half-hearted well wishes and \u201cI hope that I find what OP and her fianc\u00e9 have. Ok, well, maybe not that exactly\u201d.\n\nI told P that the speech felt like it was making a joke out of our wedding and to please cut out the parts making fun of us. He said that those parts were the majority of the speech, and they were just jokes and we would have the whole day to feel good about ourselves. I told him that if he wasn\u2019t cutting those parts out, he would not speak at my wedding.\n\nP\u2019s mom reached out to me and said that P uses public speaking to come out of his shell, and that I saw what happened to him when \u201chis voice was silenced\u201d all those years ago. P also told me that not allowing him to make jokes about cis-het people is bigoted and that he does comedy to recover from his depression, so he needs this opportunity. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH for calling out P\u2019s speech, but barring him from speaking altogether may have been extreme.

Not sure if they are MTF or FTM, but according to my mom *every* part of their life is explicitly about being trans. Their posts on Facebook are all some variation of their gender-affirming care like \u201ctaking my hormone shot now!\u201d With a picture of the injection process. Every conversation has to be about them, how tough it is for trans people, and if the conversation *isn\u2019t* about them, they turn it into one.

And if it was real, there's absolutely no way the person who wrote this could be truly conflicted as to whether or not they are the asshole", "Exactly.

So it\u2019s not like he is so ignorant that he doesn\u2019t get that this \u201cperformance\u201d would make OP and her partner feel bad. He knows but think he has the right to just because he is depressed?\n\nAlso not wanting to be made fun of in general, especially at their own wedding, is not bigoted. \n\nThere\u2019s just so much that is wrong with this that I would cancel his invitation to the wedding and cut all ties with him. \n\nNTA", "This \ud83d\udc4d", "Got you", "What was this?", "Nope.

And 91 cis-het guests.\n\nWhen you host a comedy show you attract an audience interested in hearing what you have to say. People who are easily offended don't go to see Jimmy Carr. People who are racist don't go to see Dave Chapelle. The groups at a comedy show are more uniform they all have the same kind of humour, the same beliefs etc. Where as a wedding you're going to have people from all walks of life. Great Aunt Suzie is there, your 14 year old nephew, your Christian coworker, your liberal friend etc. A group present at a wedding such as op's will not have all that much in common, but what the vast majority will have in common is this: They love and respect the bride&groom and are cis-het. \n\nThose \"jokes\" are going render the room utterly quiet. You'd be able to ear a mouse in the attic fart. Not a single giggle will be heard. People will be giving each other the wtf-sideeye. Then someone will decide enough is enough, go up to P and escort him from the premises.\n\nP is an utter idiot. Is he really so dumb he thinks people will find it funny and it won't be yet another experience of being silenced?

That could roll back, but the US was towards the front in getting this done.", "I'm not annoyed with P at all, it can be tough trying to figure out who you are after a big change like this, and it sounds like he probably has some other neuro-divergent baggage that would make it difficult to read the room in these situations. But his mum should know better, it's just weak parenting not to tell your child when they're doing something incredibly stupid like this. OP is being a good friend by trying to stop this train wreak before it happens.", "I'm a salt guy. You?", "Yes. Parenting involves guiding kids to grow, push boundaries, find themselves, and do things that get a positive result. \n\nThis would crush P really and annoy the couple and all the guests. It will not work out well for P"]}
