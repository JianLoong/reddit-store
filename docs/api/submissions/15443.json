Paul Walker is an amazing actor. He was in the fast and furious franchise for years before he tragically lost his life while he was driving a super fast car along with his friend who was a passenger. Now his daughter has to grow up without a father and Vin diesel who is her uncle is still grieving his loss. I am from Ireland and the amount of crashes here are bat shit crazy. A few years ago a lad I once was in the same school as him was out driving and he crashed and lost his life he left behind 2 kids .

I also enjoy driving fast; though granted usually only with good conditions on a proper highway with minimal traffic. But anything over about 120 and my wife is no longer comfortable. Around 150 or so she finds it unpleasant. So I don't drive that fast with her. I enjoy her company much much more than I enjoy fast driving. It's not even a choice that requires consideration for me. If your boyfriend doesn't put your comfort and emotional well being over spirited driving then his priorities are misplaced. There's also a big difference between driving fast and being outright reckless, and the number of tickets would imply recklessness. Give him a choice between your presence and reckless driving. If he chooses the latter, then you have a good idea of where his priorities lie and can reevaluate the relationship accordingly.", "NTA - I had an early bf like this and didn't know any better that this was abuse! He would drive like a maniac, and we almost crashed a few times. Tailgating, speeding, you name it! Even when I pleaded and cried for him to slow down, just stop and just let me out, he wouldn't. I had nightmares of my parents sobbing that I had died bc of his driving.\n\nDon't get in the car, he is going to have an accident one day and you could be paying for it with lifelong injuries and scarring or even worse, your life.\n\nHe was an abusive AH and 4 months later after we ended, he ended up crashing his car with 3 other people in it.\n\nIf he's acting like this already, then I bet that he also makes you feel bad about yourself and dismisses you, your opinions and your comfort. Verbal and physical abuse if not already. Guys like this are walking red flags. Not letting someone get out the car is controlling behaviour. Calling you lame for not liking his car is verbal and emotional manipulation, and he is demeaning and bullying you. He thinks you will just take it.\n\nI promise you, there are much better guys who will respect you and not put you in danger like this. Run and don't look back.", "Sounds like a BMW driver to me.
