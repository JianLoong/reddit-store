He will either get the car or his license taken away from him, or worse, he\u2019ll kill someone or himself. Just a matter of time", "NTA.\n\nYour bf is driving you away from this relationship.\n\nTake a brake.", "NTA. And if he keeps driving that way you\u2019ll both be lame, maimed, if not dead.", "NTA\n\nAre you sure your boyfriend isn't 2 14yos in a long coat?", "NTA. Your bf sounds lame. Not you. He is still in his teenager show off stage. It\u2019s also a safety risk to be speeding.", "NTA. He most certainly  is one though. Best break up with him.", "NTA. I hate overly aggressive drivers. I was a passenger once with someone who did that kind of stuff. Never again. That kind of driving is just flat out dangerous for everyone on and around the road. I gotta admit I'm not surprised it's a BMW. At least in my neck of the woods BMW drivers are notorious for speeding, weaving in and out of traffic, tailgating, and in general being assholes.", "NTA, i saw they did a [study](https://psyarxiv.com/uy7ph/) on penis size and bmw drivers. the results concluded that people with smaller members drive loud bmw cars. if he has a small dick & shit personality \u2026 why are you with him?", "NTA. this would be a deal breaker for me to be honest", "[removed]", "I had a guy like that riding my backside on a two-lane road for miles, til he finally pulled out and passed me, and the car ahead of me, just tucking in time to avoid a head-on with an oncoming driver. \nOf course, I had a guess where he was going. The same place I was, a track day at a road circuit. \nI\u2019m probably twice his age, and the car I was in had roughly a third of the power - but I admit it gave me great pleasure to ride his ass on the track til he was forced to give me a wave-by.", "I love fast cars and speed. However I haven\u2019t had a speeding ticket in longer then your BF has been alive. I respect limits and laws. I value my life, my passengers and families life. Also the other drivers on the road. There is no way you can tell what is going to happen up ahead. Dented, animals and lane changes are a real hazard that can effect the road he\u2019s driving on.", "NTA this such an ick", "NTA  I wouldn't get into the car with him personally.  He sounds like an accident waiting to happen and someone might die...and it might be you if you keep riding with him.", "NTA, and if he thinks you're lame, you can point to at least three other people that are on your side.", "NTA and he sounds like a huge loser", "NTA.  With 3 tickets in 3 months you will probably both be taking an Uber soon.  Driving fast is fun but it sounds like he\u2019s being reckless and isn\u2019t taking the hints.  Hope he doesn\u2019t hurt/kill anyone!", "NTA! Walk away before he kills you or someone else with his careless driving!", "NTA.  He sounds reckless and I bet he has a wreck soon.", "NTA, but let\u2019s be real, as his girlfriend, I\u2019m sure you know what he\u2019s compensating for.", "everyones talking shit on the boyfriend as if they wouldnt do the same thing in a brand new sports car. But with that being said, youre NTA he should respect you and not do all that with him in the car.", "NTA- that's reckless driving and he's a ticket or two away from a suspended license, or one slow reaction time from the morgue. \n\nSave yourself.", "NTA he should have the car taken away", "NTA. He clearly has no care for your life.", "Let me guess, he didn\u2019t opt for the turn-signal package. \n\nNTA", "I hang around a lot of bikers and car guys who like to speed and make loud mods to their vehicles. I will never put myself at risk over some guy\u2019s ego trip. I find it hilarious when car guys think this is attractive to other people when 99% of the people who like it are other guys. \n\nNTA", "NTA and your boyfriend sounds like a d bag", "nta, my bf loves car n speed too but whenever im passenger he knows when to limit and put MY safety before anything else. if your bf cannot ensure safety and prioritize that, well \u2026 that\u2019s something thats worth considering \u2026", "Oh yeah, super fun of him to put your life in danger /s\n\nNTA, and this would potentially be break-up bad for me.", "NTA - if he really wanted to go fast he would go to a track day, all he's doing is being reckless.\n\nI would seriously consider your interest in this person.", "NTA, if he loves you he shouldn't be driving recklessly with you in the car.", "You sure your not dating a minor? He sounds like he's never been in a wreck, or experienced any consequences for idiotic behavior.\n\nDon't drive with him, and don't hold back when he inevitably crashes. If he ends up hurting people in the process than guilt trip him. There have been too many deaths on roadways because of immaturity.\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA, He should take it to the track, streets are for driving, not racing, maybe the joke about BMW driving fast isn't a joke. But seriously he's gonna get into a crash and kill someone, or himself.", "Well a few more points on his license and he won't be enjoying it for awhile.  HE's the AH not you.", "This is the earliest midlife crisis I've ever heard of NTA", "NTA, your boyfriend is the person everyone makes fun of or dislikes immediately based on their driving.", "Sounds like it would be a cool car, if your bf wasn't an AH driver. You are NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Someone in a car like your boyfriend's almost ran me off the road today with my daughter in the backseat. For what it's worth, I hope your boyfriend crashes and is paralyzed from the waist down before he gets someone else killed.", "NTA. Note to your bf: no one else finds it fun and thrilling and he is the only thinking endangering your life and everyone else\u2019s as being funny. Stop riding with him, your life is far more valuable.", "Does he live in Glendale, CA?  Glendale is known for people in BMWs driving too fast. It's one of the reasons we have some of the highest car insurance rates in the country", "OP's boyfriend is the worst kind of car guy. I've been involved in the car scene for roughly 20 years now, and there's always been immature idiots like him. As you said, track days exist for a reason, though I understand some people can't afford that option. You still don't play *in traffic.*\n\nOP, your boyfriend doesn't have the wisdom to know how unskilled he is. I'm sure he thinks he's a great driver, but he isn't. If he keeps at this, he'll eventually push his luck too far. If he wanted to risk his own life, whatever. He's doing this in traffic though, and he's making all the other drivers possible targets of his stupid choices. \n\nDO NOT RIDE WITH HIM.", "As someone who likes fast cars, I agree. Take it to the track, otherwise you\u2019re probably gonna lose the car when you kill someone.", "BF is the reason BMW drivers have a bad rep. I bet you any money he never, ever indicates.", "Same. Occasionally I get on my car but usually it\u2019s only me and definitely when there is no traffic around me.  If I have anyone in the car I drive it much more conservatively.  My car only comes out on beautiful sunny days so it\u2019s not too often that I drive it.", "Very much NTA and your BF is a huge one at that. I\u2019m a bit of a car guy myself and I absolutely HATE when people get their cars, no matter how expensive/sporty they are, tuned to have loud ass exhaust. To me, it\u2019s tacky and annoying. It\u2019s one thing to get a better flowing exhaust that maybe is a bit louder, but it should still be muffled enough to smooth it to a nice note instead of brash noise.", "What's the difference between a porcupine and a BMW?\n\nA porcupine has a prick on the outside.", "Maybe he's compensating for other issues?", "Yeah I\u2019m surprised I had to scroll this far for someone to mention the \u201clame\u201d comment. \n\nOP, if you\u2019re considering a future with this man, please sit down and have a very serious conversation about this. He\u2019s being unsafe, financially irresponsible, and rude to you. NTA", "Came to say this, but you were much classier. \n\nNTA", "Yep. And quite possibly OP as well, if she continues to ride with him.", "Imagine the price of his insurance when it renews. If it does.", "Same! Fianc\u00e9 has an M3 and would never drive like that with me in the car. There\u2019s a time and a place to push those cars (track days), and weaving in and out of traffic with your terrified partner in the passenger seat is NOT it.", "My fiance made enough to buy a nice car. (Audi Rs6 Avant heavily modified, car before was a lancer evo) He doesn't drive like an absolute moron. NTA", "Bruh, did you miss the part where he's a reckless driver? No one should be into that.", "this only applies to harmless things, what op\u2019s bf is doing isn\u2019t harmless and they shouldn\u2019t have to put up with it for his dumbass sake", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

What we do know is he is enjoying his beautiful m4 that we also know is going to cost well into the 1000s if he's lucky to repair from this rough driving...as long as he has the cash it's worth it I guess. I have one of my bimmers in the shop currently", "Also, their air conditioning SUCKS", "Nope, he is a good driver. He races on old airfields and events with his friends. He does not drive like an idiot on the main road. He's also never been in an accident while driving, and he's 38. Even I have a worse driving record than him as I wrote off his evo, accidently but still.\n\n\nEdit: I also like how you are trying to tell me how my own fiance drives, like I'm never in the car with him. Lol", "You think she's a soft ah because her bf will have to spend a lot of time fixing his car? She doesn't enjoy how he bf drives. Are you saying she should pretend? What is your logic, here?

Where are the tickets for reckless driving since speeding tickets were issued...where are the wrecks talked about???.......some of is like our cars and enjoy the engineering went into them....to each their own", "Your wife's cooking doesn't make you feel like you're in danger. Simple logic.", "It makes me feel in danger especially the multiple times I got sick....you know what....of course...universal logic versus what feels like nonsense...so im done replying...say whatever you wanna say so you feel like you got the last word", "You wouldn't be the asshole if you stopped eating your wife's food after it made you sick. And don't use an illogical fallacy on me saying that I'm going to answer to you because I want to have the last word. That's a form of manipulation and it's rude. Again, you would not be the ah if you stopped eating your wife's food because it made you sick. Lmao."]}
