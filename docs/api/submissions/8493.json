When I (31M) was 15, my parents had my younger brother Alex, and about 8 months after that, they passed away in a car accident while I was at home babysitting my brother. Lived with grandparents until I was 18, moved out adopted my brother, and started a job.\n\nI slowly began to really hate my job, I had always been interested in the sciences, and since a young age I wanted to be a scientist. On top of that most of friends had moved on with their lives, and My life was becoming extremley boring, and kinda depressing. So at the age of 29, Alex (14), I decided to enroll in college. Unfortunately my home province has a very limited selection of programs So knowing that I wanted to get a science degree, we moved to Ontario so I could attend college their. Alex was not happy.\n\nNow in our second year weve both been able to form new friends groups. I had plans with mine last weekend to go out for the night. At around 11pm I get a phone call from one of our neighbours, theres a large group of people at my house, along w/ extremley loud music. First big planned night out, and I didnt even make it to midnight. Omw home I was able to get ahold of alex and I told him nothing more than that I was Omw, and would be home in about 20 mins. When I saw the house I was furious. The place looked like a tornado ripped through it, booze all over the place, essentially every rug was stained and had to be thrown out, several chairs and the coffe table were completley destroyed, and the bathroom looked like somebody had a water ballon fight with piss balloons. (Replacing everything cost me about $1100)\n\nI grounded him for a month, took away his phone, and playstation. 3 Days in I decided that he could use his playstation, but it would have to be in the living room with me (I was hoping that hed start playing games with me like we did when he was younger and that we could bond over it)\n\nHes essentially refused to speak to me all week, just coming down eating and then going back to his room. Yesterday tough he suddenly became extremley angry at me when I tried talking to him at the dinner table, he started yelling about how Ive ruined his life, about making him move away from all of his friends, and how now that hes finally made new ones Im not letting him hang out with them. He told me he hates me and that he wishes I had just put him in an orphanage as a kid, because any family would be better then me, and that I was just being selfish by adopting him.\n\nI spent the entire night crying, prob even more so then when my parents died. Im starting to really regret having ever moved here, I feel like shit for uprooting his life when he was in HS and honestly wish that I had just stayed at my dead end job. Im also thinking that maybes hes right about the adoption, maybe it was selfish of me to keep him from having a real family.\n\nSo reddit what do you think about all of this, AITA for adopting him, making him move, grounding him?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you everybody for the wonderfully kind words, youve all honestly made me feel so much better about myself, and realize that hes just acting out like a normal teen. Ive seen a lot of you mention therapy, and Im in the porcess of getting us some family therapy sessions, and Im also gonna see if I can get him some therapy on his own. Im also taking up your advice on re-thinking the punishment, Im obviouslty not just gonna drop all of it, but I am gonna see if hes interested in joing any after school things so that hell still be able to have a social life.

Grounding for a month is also not working at this age as it only create a bigger ressentiment and over time will increase the gap between you. You did a wonderful job taking care of him but you have to keep in mind that in four years he will be himself in college and you will have more time for yourself. Is the move is permanent? Can he go see his friends sometimes? Are you able to start your science program online for him to be able to stay in his environment? These are importants questions for you to reflect.

That's a sentence every parent will/could hear from their teenage kids. They are kind of selfish and only looking on them self.\n\nYou are amazing with what you have done for your brother and sacrified for him. And it is great that you are looking in doing other stuff, as well as beeing a good role model for your brother. \n\nLet him have his 'I hate you' phase. Be there for him, when he is ready to talk again and after a while try to explain to him again, why you had punished him. That money is not growing on trees. But if he has another solution (like he will pay for the damage himself and clean after them) you are willing to listen.", "NTA\n\nHe is a teenager. Nature made sure kids start to have the desire to become independent as older they get. And when they love their parents very much they will \"hate\" them the same when these phases occure. Its also the age when testosteron starts kicking in.  Relocating and having lost his parents young sure makes him act out more and you could start family counseling with him to warm him up to the idea for single therapy sessions for him, i guess he could need it to make sure his unconventional upcoming doesn't lead to issues later in his life (and i guess thats exactly what you are worried about). \n\nHe lost his friends and thought he can make new friends easy by \"buying\" them with \"look, i'm the cool dude with the party house\" but sooner or later he will see that this behaviour attracts the wrong ppl. But not now, now he is 14 wanting to act and be seen as an adult and you are in the way so you are enemy nr 1. Its normal and totally fine. The only thing you need to do better is not to backtrap on reasonable punishments bc you feel guilty. You do no favour for both of you with this. \n\nIf you are looking at him, i bet you still see the cute little boy. And he knows this. But he sees himself as a totally mature adult and wants to be treated like this. You can  start treating him like an parttime adult (giving him adult responsibilities while still not forgetting he is still a child). Like let him work out a household budget and make him responsible e.g. for grocery shopping within this budget (still take him there but let him do the shopping and paying), and if he learnt to manage this (with a few failures oc where you have to return the groceries bc the card got declined during checkout and you have to eat ramen for a few days - don't complain) you can give him more responsibilities. Best case he grows with the responsibilities.", "INFO: Sorry if this comes off as insensitive, just genuine curiosity, but why didn\u2019t your grandparents keep custody of your brother and would he be willing to go back now? I\u2019m not calling you an ah, but you gotta understand that he\u2019s a kid and his life was uprooted not that long ago, and he\u2019s going through his whole life without his parents, that hits so hard when you\u2019re a teenager trying to maneuver through life. I absolutely think that what he did deserves some sort of punishment. Another thing, don\u2019t force him to hang out with you when he\u2019s punished, the last thing a teenager would want to do is hang out with the guy who severed his social life for a month. Teenagers do and say stupid shit so don\u2019t take it to heart. Give him some space, and maybe let him take the playstation to his room or wherever it was before, don\u2019t make him feel like a toddler. Anyways, hope you\u2019re doing okay, please remember that you\u2019re doing your best", " NTA hold your ground I know it\u2019s hard is it possible for the grandparents to take him for a while?

NTA", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou have had to make tough decisions in life and made the best ones you could make to have a good future for your brother, but also for yourself.\n\nHe's angry now after that party thing, understandably from his perspective, so he's going to through stuff at you. Teenagers throw stuff at their parents too. \"I wish you never had me!\" etc.\n\nIt happens.\n\nI hope you will manage to see that he's a teenager with the stresses of teenage life and he's angry right now, but that this doesn't mean that it's your fault or responsibility to make his anger go away. Be there for him like a stable parent, if you can. Love him in spite of his anger, but give him some space, without stopping to love or be there for him, so he can feel the stability. Allow him to have his teenage angst and anger. It's a stage in development and he will get over it.\n\nHowever, this whole situation und the way your life has gone, is overly taxing. It would be great if you could get support from a therapist to deal with stresses like this. It's not fair you should have to deal with this by yourself. Your life has been burdened by the sudden loss and responsibility. This must have taken an immense emotional toll.

Asides moving away from friends, he\u2019s now around the age you were when you lost your parents.\n\nMy guess is his hormones and frustration at having to start over and anger at what life took away from him, is exacerbating into one massive whirlwind of emotions. It\u2019s not you he doesn\u2019t want to be with. And you are his real family. Just not the picture perfect mum, dad, 2.4 children he\u2019s been denied and very likely sees all around him and he\u2019s allowed to grieve for that. \n\nAs a Brit, therapy isn\u2019t normally the first thing we shout. But he needs it. You both lost the same parents, but your experiences are very different. You lost the parents you knew and loved.

You are clearly a great human being and a tremendous sibling/father figure for your brother, and it\u2019s heartbreaking that he doesn\u2019t yet understand the enormous sacrifice you made for him. \n\nYou were put in a terrible position when you were still, in many ways, a child. To lose both parents at 15/16, to have your life uprooted and future plans derailed, and to *still* decide that the most important thing was to prioritize your brother when you were only 18 speaks volumes about your character in the very best ways. To be very clear, nothing you\u2019ve described indicates you were selfish: you put your life on pause for over a decade to care for and provide for him, and quite frankly, your brother seems to be in a teenage fantasy land if he thinks that his life would\u2019ve been \u201cbetter\u201d if he\u2019d gone to an orphanage and *maybe* been adopted by some other family. I say this as an adoptee who had a fantastic adoption and hates the stigma attached to adoption in general, but who recognizes that not all adoptions are made equal. By taking him in, you guaranteed that he\u2019d be raised by someone who loves him dearly. \n\nI think that your brother is at an age, however, when you need to start having serious conversations with him. I personally believe that there\u2019s nothing wrong with explaining the sacrifices you\u2019ve made to a teenager who doesn\u2019t appreciate them. You shouldn\u2019t blame him, but you should make it clear that everything you\u2019ve done has been for him and his words hurt you. You also need to have a talk with him about the quality of friends that he\u2019s hanging out with and that bad decisions have consequences. I think you need to take a firmer stance here because he betrayed your trust by throwing that party and you didn\u2019t even impose a harsh punishment. He didn\u2019t have to get a job to repay you for the damages, he just lost his PlayStation for a few days and can\u2019t hang out with bad influences. The horror.

What you\u2019ve done is amazing, and although it may not feel like it - I think it\u2019s a great thing that he\u2019s acting like an immature, self-absorbed jerk. In other words, like an average 14 year old boy. In many similar scenarios, both siblings are forced to grow up too quickly - you went from being a kid to a parent in one night, but you\u2019ve allowed your brother to stay a kid. That\u2019s amazing. But I do echo the other calls for both individual and family therapy. You guys have been through a lot, and sometimes it take an impartial third party to help process everything.", "NTA - but he needs supportive therapy.

Good luck.", "Yes, you are....the way every good parent is to their teenager. \n\nAlex is using emotional blackmail to try and manipulate you. Don't let it work.

Consider therapy for him and for you.   \n\nIt isn't clear how much you consulted Alex in the decision to move. If you did not,  you probably want to talk with him about feeling conflicted and badly about what the move cost him.

However, you may want to consider where Alex is coming from. It sounds like he has felt socially isolated and desperate for friends. This desperation could have led him to throw a party to make friends (possibly against his better judgement). Now with getting grounded and phone taken away he is even further isolated from his peers. This could cause him to lash out at you. I can\u2019t imagine he meant the things that he said to you. \n\nTalk to him about how he\u2019s feeling. As a side note, there is a lot of evidence that month-long grounding especially for teens is ineffective.", "NTA, you're doing what you think is best, and he's being a moody teen with a very misinformed view on the foster care system.

They always hate on their parent, say things they don't mean etc. \n\nPlease don't be too hard on him. \n\nI'm a MASSIVE fan of therapy, everyone should have it. Even if there isn't an issue. Maybe consider it if you haven't already, for both of you. You've been through a lot!! \n\nHang in there - parenting is HARD!!", "Nta\n\nI, to my shame, have said worse to my parents during my teenage years. One thing I remember is telling my mom I hated her after grounding me and missing a date. She looked me dead in the eyes and said it\u2019s ok to hate her because she loves me enough for both of us. It didn\u2019t help at the time but I\u2019m now in my 50\u2019s and I still remember that. \n\nI\u2019ve raised 4 and I promise they\u2019ll get past it as they age. \n\nYou\u2019re a superstar and give yourself the credit you deserve.", "Introduce him to AITA and he'll quickly find out that unappreciative teenagers are assholes.\n\nNTA\n\nThere are so many posts about this topic.", "NTA First of all, bless you for stepping up to the plate after being dealt be such a devastating blow. Few people would have been that responsible at that age. Never, ever, ever beat yourself up or second guess what have, in reality, been noble and reasonable decisions on your part, because none of those decisions have been easy and none were made with purely your own self interest in mind.\n\nFourteen-year-olds are difficult. It's a tough stage. As high school freshmen, they're yearning to be accepted, but they're really immature, self absorbed, and often make poor decisions in their efforts to fit in. They also tend to lash out verbally and say things they don't really mean and will later regret. Give by your brother a little more time to calm down and have a reasonable discussion. DO NOT be rash, pull up stakes, and disrupt your career path. You deserve to pursue your education.  Tell your brother that at fourteen it is not too late for him to be put up for adoption, and if he truly believes going to a home of strangers will give him a better life, you'll make the call and get the process started.", "NTA. And welcome to the reality of parenting a teen, but with extra layers of complexity and by yourself. \n\nI am so, so, sorry OP. You have recovered from a very traumatic event and shouldered a lot of responsibility. You\u2019re doing a great job - as evident by how you managed his punishment and created a concession which could allow you two to bond. \n\nYou got this. Keep showing him love and have honest conversations about why you did this, and what you hope for him and his future.", "NTA. I'm sorry, you have a teenager. Every adopted kid tries out \"my real family/some other family would be better\" at some point. Try to be nonreactive. Remind him that he's experiencing consequences for his own actions, and that he'll be able to hang out with his friends soon -- a month seems like forever when you're 14, but it isn't, actually, forever. This'll pass.", "NTA I've 3 children...thry all hated me at 14...I was apparently always ruining their lives!! Now they are in there 20s...I'm the best thing since sliced bread!! \n\nFurthering your career will be beneficial to both of you long term. You made the right decision", "NTA- teenagers can be little shits who have an amazing ability to find what they know will hurt you the most and use it when needed. It\u2019s part of their job. He was prob sitting on that one for a while. I guarantee he doesn\u2019t believe that. More likely he\u2019s upset he got caught and he knew there was no way out- so why not try to lob an offensive and get you defending yourself. And it worked!!\n\nI\u2019m sure there are real feelings of hurt underneath but they probably aren\u2019t about you! They are likely about every other adult in his life who left for one reason or another. If he\u2019s open to it now might be a good time to go back to therapy or counseling if the move is bringing up old wounds.", "NTA, for sure, but I might rethink the method of punishment a bit. I know it makes sense to you, but to a teenage brain, it's going to look like you're saying \"You are not allowed to spend time with or talk to your friends because I only want you to talk to and spend time with me.\" Maybe something a little more connected to what he actually did wrong (like making him pay you back for the damages with chores or something)?", "NTA!  But you need some help navigating everything in your life.  You have given up your young adulthood to raise your brother and you are entitled to go to university to better yourself and provide better for yourself and your brother and you are entitled to a night out.  Don\u2019t feel guilty about these decisions or for disciplining your brother for his inappropriate behavior.  Be there for him and when he is ready he will talk to you.  I suggest family therapy to talk out these issues.  He needs a reality check on all you have done for him without being made to feel guilty over it.  Also, be a brother to him and not just his parent.", " I was an AH to my parents when I was 14 it\u2019s just that age you take everything personally so don\u2019t overthink it. Maybe see if you can send him to extended family for a break or plan a trip. Speak to his teachers about his behaviour at school too maybe there\u2019s something going on a crush or he\u2019s trying to get more friends.", "First, im so sorry for your loss! Second, NTA. Teenagers are moody creature by nature and do not always think about how hurtful words can be. If you havent already started it, I would recommend counseling both individual and family to help deal with the grief of losing your folks, and to help navigate the transition from sibling to parent. He will come around and be greatful you took him in eventually.", "NTA.\n\nI get your feelings and you're totally right to feel destroyed by his anger and hate.\n\nBut please, don't feel guilty for a second. You made the right decisions for both of you and you definitely know better than him. You have been a parent long enough to realize that not every whim of the children is sound nor sensible, and you don't have to consult him for every and any decision.\n\nNo, you did not uproot him. No, you did not deprive him of a family. But if he thinks that way, tell him to suggest options and how he would implement them. Usually, when teens are asked to manage their lives for real, they tone it down at realizing how complicated it is.\n\nDo your grandparents still live? Would he like to live with them for a while, with all the messy school change and that? Would they want to take him in?\n\nAnd you should find a way to make him pay for the damaged furniture. A small job on the weekends, for example.", "NTA. You have gone above and beyond for your brother. Try your best to let it go. Teenagers tend to be very self centered and clueless about how hurtful their words are. Give him ten or so years and I think that he will be much more grateful for your sacrifices.", "NTA. He is a teenager. They are mean balls of hormones. I was an awful teenager and told my parents I hated them constantly. The fact that Alex is lashing out like that shows how comfortable he is with you, because you are safe. The teenage years are hell", "NTA.\n\nHe should be grateful you took him under your wing. Remember, he's frustrated and doesn't mean what he says. But you were completely in the right, and have nothing to be ashamed/guilty for. \n\nAlso, you did NOT ruin his life. You saved it.", "NTA\n\nfamilies move and kids have to change school. it's a normal thing that happens all the time.", "Every parent of a teenager has heard the exact same speech from their kid. Parents have to move their families for various reasons all the time. It\u2019s hard, but they adjust. You are doing right by your kid and he\u2019ll realize that one day. Being a teenager sucks and turns everyone into the absolute worst version of themselves. Might be worth looking into therapy for the both of you (together and separately) tho. You\u2019ve both been through quite a bit of trauma, and having some tools to manage it could be helpful.", "NTA", "NAH.", "NTA", "Nah NTA he would have said the most hurtful stuff in his arsenal regardless of his family situation, adopted, put it an orphanage, raised by your parents. He\u2019s a teenager, it just comes with the territory. Try not to take it personally.", "NTA. Don't let his anger get to you. This is pretty normal for his age and has nothing to do with you. He will be more thankful when he's older, but in the meantime he will resent you because he thinks you are the problem. I don't think he realizes what it's actually like being in foster homes. You were also not wrong to pursue further education in order to do something that would make you happier. We are our choices and you are making choices to improve the life of you and your brother. Don't doubt that. Staying in a dead end job is not the way.", "op=Re edit yeah\n\nNot sure what all is the punishment, but while he's being \"social\" maybe a job too??? So he can pay back slowly but surely some of the costs of the damage.\n\nI believe that is important.  Responsibility for actions over punishment.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s delusional to think that he would\u2019ve been better off in a orphanage and some great well off magical parents would\u2019ve adopted him. Teenagers are assholes so of course they are going to say ridiculous things.", "NTA. You did right by him in adopting him, in leaving your dead end job to go to college. \n\nI wouldn't worry about ruining his life, there are innumerable ways to ruin a 14 year olds life, moving, refusing to pay for the right brand of clothing, acknowledging their existence in public, so many ways that you could ruin his life multiple times daily.\n\nYou're fine. 14 is a tough age having parents and not moving.", "As someone who had a view stints in county children's homes because of a disintegrating family, I am confident Alex would not have liked being in an orphanage.\n\nA H, no you are a Rockstar! NTA", "I have been looking into family therapy, and am trying to get us an appointment next week, so hopefully that helps out. While I dont plan to completley drop his punishment, I am thinking about letting him join an after school sports/group thing, just so that he can hopefully make friends. I really like your idea of giving him adult responsibilities, Ill bring it up to the therapist after the session to see what they think.", "The move is and isnt permanent. My program couldnt be done online as it required in person labs multiple times per week, so from september until june, were here in ontario. We go back to your home province for about 3 weeks during christmas, as well as for our summer break. As for the groudning, Im thinking about being a little more lenient, maybe asking him if he wants to join an after school group or something. Ill most likely let him start seeing his friends again pretty soon too.", "Surprised I had to scroll so long to find an NAH, totally agree. Life isn't fair, it totally sucks that both kids had to grow up without parents. There are no easy answers in this situation.", "Honestly dont really plan to keep up the month long grounding, It was mostly just a decision that came from me being very angry. Im gonna see if hes interetsed in after school sports/activities, so that hell still be able to see/make friends. Also planning to see a family therapist next week so Ill bring it up to them what they think about the punishment.", "Grandparents were old and just before deciding to move out and raise him on my own my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer. Hes good now, but at the time it was just too hard for them to juggle all of that at once. We also moved back into my parents house which was connected to my grandparents so they still played a huge role in helping to raise him.", "Grandparents were old at the time and not the best suited to be looking after a child for the next 18 years. The big thing that pushed me to move out was my grandfathers cancer diagnosis, Not only was it hard on them to have us both in the house, but Alex was getting kinda scared seeing his grandfathers quickly declining health (Hes okay now, treatment worked). Luckily for us our parents house was joined to my grandparents house, so we didnt really move far."]}
