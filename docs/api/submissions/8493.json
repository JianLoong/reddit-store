When I (31M) was 15, my parents had my younger brother Alex, and about 8 months after that, they passed away in a car accident while I was at home babysitting my brother. Lived with grandparents until I was 18, moved out adopted my brother, and started a job.\n\nI slowly began to really hate my job, I had always been interested in the sciences, and since a young age I wanted to be a scientist. On top of that most of friends had moved on with their lives, and My life was becoming extremley boring, and kinda depressing. So at the age of 29, Alex (14), I decided to enroll in college. Unfortunately my home province has a very limited selection of programs So knowing that I wanted to get a science degree, we moved to Ontario so I could attend college their. Alex was not happy.\n\nNow in our second year weve both been able to form new friends groups. I had plans with mine last weekend to go out for the night. At around 11pm I get a phone call from one of our neighbours, theres a large group of people at my house, along w/ extremley loud music. First big planned night out, and I didnt even make it to midnight. Omw home I was able to get ahold of alex and I told him nothing more than that I was Omw, and would be home in about 20 mins. When I saw the house I was furious. The place looked like a tornado ripped through it, booze all over the place, essentially every rug was stained and had to be thrown out, several chairs and the coffe table were completley destroyed, and the bathroom looked like somebody had a water ballon fight with piss balloons. (Replacing everything cost me about $1100)\n\nI grounded him for a month, took away his phone, and playstation. 3 Days in I decided that he could use his playstation, but it would have to be in the living room with me (I was hoping that hed start playing games with me like we did when he was younger and that we could bond over it)\n\nHes essentially refused to speak to me all week, just coming down eating and then going back to his room. Yesterday tough he suddenly became extremley angry at me when I tried talking to him at the dinner table, he started yelling about how Ive ruined his life, about making him move away from all of his friends, and how now that hes finally made new ones Im not letting him hang out with them. He told me he hates me and that he wishes I had just put him in an orphanage as a kid, because any family would be better then me, and that I was just being selfish by adopting him.\n\nI spent the entire night crying, prob even more so then when my parents died. Im starting to really regret having ever moved here, I feel like shit for uprooting his life when he was in HS and honestly wish that I had just stayed at my dead end job. Im also thinking that maybes hes right about the adoption, maybe it was selfish of me to keep him from having a real family.\n\nSo reddit what do you think about all of this, AITA for adopting him, making him move, grounding him?", "created_utc": 1674875788, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10n4nxd/aita_for_adopting_my_brother_and_ruining_his_life/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are an amazing parent/ older sibling. Just give him time. 14 can be a rough age with transition. You have the right to live your life too. You have sacrificed a lot in the last decade for your brother. He is too young to realize it and hopefully someday he will thank you.", "NTA\n\nYou put your life on hold and did what was best for him in the long run.  He is a teenager that is lashing out.  Yes, you may feel guilty, but as any teenager will do, he tried to hit you where he knew it would hurt.\n\nYou are attempting to make both your lives better by getting and education and better prospects.  Yes, he moved during HS, but not in his Jr/Sr year and he will survive.  Many kids do.  \n\nSounds like you both could benefit from some therapy, together and separately.  Keep moving forward and you too will make it through his teenage years.  Your a good brother.", "NTA. Alex is 14, and teenagers are volatile jerks sometimes. I can't say whether the decisions you have made for you and your bro were the right ones, bc I don't know the particulars, but I can tell you that what a pissed off 14 year old says after being justifiably punished is not an accurate representation of reality.\n\nETA: also, you have clearly made heroic sacrifices for your brother, and that's admirable.", "NTA. \nMaybe you and your brother need therapy. \nYou had a lot of hard times and it's possible that he is still grieving (not only his parents but grieving the \"conventional life\" he would've had if your parents were still there). It is only a normal way of processing such hard times. \n\nYou are doing your best and you can be very proud of you. It's also okay of thinking of your own future as well. \n\nYou can suggest him to bond with friends by organizing another (smaller) event with him or offering to drop him at another party or something. Maybe trying a new sport and be part of a team?\n\nLots of kids move cities while in high school. It is hard but not a death sentence.", "NTA you are a good person, the teenage years are hard. But think you both need therapy.", "NTA Moving is sucky for kids, but they adapt. Your brother is a teenager and everything is dramatic at that age. From your account, it sounds like you're doing the right things.", "NTA However, moving a teenager in a new province can bring some unexpected challenges in your daily life. You did a lot for him but in the perspective of a 14 years old the life he knows is destroyed. This is why he is not able to understand what you are doing for him because teenagers\u2019 brains are self-centre. Grounding for a month is also not working at this age as it only create a bigger ressentiment and over time will increase the gap between you. You did a wonderful job taking care of him but you have to keep in mind that in four years he will be himself in college and you will have more time for yourself. Is the move is permanent? Can he go see his friends sometimes? Are you able to start your science program online for him to be able to stay in his environment? These are importants questions for you to reflect. In the meantime take one day at the time as rebuilding relationship with your younger brother will help you to make the best decisions for both of you.", "NTA he needs serious therapy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
