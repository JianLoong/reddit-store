When I (31M) was 15, my parents had my younger brother Alex, and about 8 months after that, they passed away in a car accident while I was at home babysitting my brother. Lived with grandparents until I was 18, moved out adopted my brother, and started a job.\n\nI slowly began to really hate my job, I had always been interested in the sciences, and since a young age I wanted to be a scientist. On top of that most of friends had moved on with their lives, and My life was becoming extremley boring, and kinda depressing. So at the age of 29, Alex (14), I decided to enroll in college. Unfortunately my home province has a very limited selection of programs So knowing that I wanted to get a science degree, we moved to Ontario so I could attend college their. Alex was not happy.\n\nNow in our second year weve both been able to form new friends groups. I had plans with mine last weekend to go out for the night. At around 11pm I get a phone call from one of our neighbours, theres a large group of people at my house, along w/ extremley loud music. First big planned night out, and I didnt even make it to midnight. Omw home I was able to get ahold of alex and I told him nothing more than that I was Omw, and would be home in about 20 mins. When I saw the house I was furious. The place looked like a tornado ripped through it, booze all over the place, essentially every rug was stained and had to be thrown out, several chairs and the coffe table were completley destroyed, and the bathroom looked like somebody had a water ballon fight with piss balloons. (Replacing everything cost me about $1100)\n\nI grounded him for a month, took away his phone, and playstation. 3 Days in I decided that he could use his playstation, but it would have to be in the living room with me (I was hoping that hed start playing games with me like we did when he was younger and that we could bond over it)\n\nHes essentially refused to speak to me all week, just coming down eating and then going back to his room. Yesterday tough he suddenly became extremley angry at me when I tried talking to him at the dinner table, he started yelling about how Ive ruined his life, about making him move away from all of his friends, and how now that hes finally made new ones Im not letting him hang out with them. He told me he hates me and that he wishes I had just put him in an orphanage as a kid, because any family would be better then me, and that I was just being selfish by adopting him.\n\nI spent the entire night crying, prob even more so then when my parents died. Im starting to really regret having ever moved here, I feel like shit for uprooting his life when he was in HS and honestly wish that I had just stayed at my dead end job. Im also thinking that maybes hes right about the adoption, maybe it was selfish of me to keep him from having a real family.\n\nSo reddit what do you think about all of this, AITA for adopting him, making him move, grounding him?", "created_utc": 1674875788, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10n4nxd/aita_for_adopting_my_brother_and_ruining_his_life/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are an amazing parent/ older sibling. Just give him time. 14 can be a rough age with transition. You have the right to live your life too. You have sacrificed a lot in the last decade for your brother. He is too young to realize it and hopefully someday he will thank you.", "NTA\n\nYou put your life on hold and did what was best for him in the long run.  He is a teenager that is lashing out.  Yes, you may feel guilty, but as any teenager will do, he tried to hit you where he knew it would hurt.\n\nYou are attempting to make both your lives better by getting and education and better prospects.  Yes, he moved during HS, but not in his Jr/Sr year and he will survive.  Many kids do.  \n\nSounds like you both could benefit from some therapy, together and separately.  Keep moving forward and you too will make it through his teenage years.  Your a good brother.", "NTA. Alex is 14, and teenagers are volatile jerks sometimes. I can't say whether the decisions you have made for you and your bro were the right ones, bc I don't know the particulars, but I can tell you that what a pissed off 14 year old says after being justifiably punished is not an accurate representation of reality.\n\nETA: also, you have clearly made heroic sacrifices for your brother, and that's admirable.", "NTA. \nMaybe you and your brother need therapy. \nYou had a lot of hard times and it's possible that he is still grieving (not only his parents but grieving the \"conventional life\" he would've had if your parents were still there). It is only a normal way of processing such hard times. \n\nYou are doing your best and you can be very proud of you. It's also okay of thinking of your own future as well. \n\nYou can suggest him to bond with friends by organizing another (smaller) event with him or offering to drop him at another party or something. Maybe trying a new sport and be part of a team?\n\nLots of kids move cities while in high school. It is hard but not a death sentence.", "NTA you are a good person, the teenage years are hard. But think you both need therapy.", "NTA Moving is sucky for kids, but they adapt. Your brother is a teenager and everything is dramatic at that age. From your account, it sounds like you're doing the right things.", "NTA However, moving a teenager in a new province can bring some unexpected challenges in your daily life. You did a lot for him but in the perspective of a 14 years old the life he knows is destroyed. This is why he is not able to understand what you are doing for him because teenagers\u2019 brains are self-centre. Grounding for a month is also not working at this age as it only create a bigger ressentiment and over time will increase the gap between you. You did a wonderful job taking care of him but you have to keep in mind that in four years he will be himself in college and you will have more time for yourself. Is the move is permanent? Can he go see his friends sometimes? Are you able to start your science program online for him to be able to stay in his environment? These are importants questions for you to reflect. In the meantime take one day at the time as rebuilding relationship with your younger brother will help you to make the best decisions for both of you.", "NTA he needs serious therapy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

YOU'RE NOT EVEN MY REAL MOM.\"\n\n35 - \"THANK GOD YOU BECAME MY MOM.\"\n\nMy real life example of growing up adopted by my birth father's sister. I was 14. Forced to move schools. Hated everyone, including myself.\n\nJust keep trying your best and remember, he's a kid. Kids are always the A H lol.", "NTA. Your brother is just pubescent. That's a sentence every parent will/could hear from their teenage kids. They are kind of selfish and only looking on them self.\n\nYou are amazing with what you have done for your brother and sacrified for him. And it is great that you are looking in doing other stuff, as well as beeing a good role model for your brother. \n\nLet him have his 'I hate you' phase. Be there for him, when he is ready to talk again and after a while try to explain to him again, why you had punished him. That money is not growing on trees. But if he has another solution (like he will pay for the damage himself and clean after them) you are willing to listen.", "NTA\n\nHe is a teenager. Nature made sure kids start to have the desire to become independent as older they get. And when they love their parents very much they will \"hate\" them the same when these phases occure. Its also the age when testosteron starts kicking in.  Relocating and having lost his parents young sure makes him act out more and you could start family counseling with him to warm him up to the idea for single therapy sessions for him, i guess he could need it to make sure his unconventional upcoming doesn't lead to issues later in his life (and i guess thats exactly what you are worried about). \n\nHe lost his friends and thought he can make new friends easy by \"buying\" them with \"look, i'm the cool dude with the party house\" but sooner or later he will see that this behaviour attracts the wrong ppl. But not now, now he is 14 wanting to act and be seen as an adult and you are in the way so you are enemy nr 1. Its normal and totally fine. The only thing you need to do better is not to backtrap on reasonable punishments bc you feel guilty. You do no favour for both of you with this. \n\nIf you are looking at him, i bet you still see the cute little boy. And he knows this. But he sees himself as a totally mature adult and wants to be treated like this. You can  start treating him like an parttime adult (giving him adult responsibilities while still not forgetting he is still a child). Like let him work out a household budget and make him responsible e.g. for grocery shopping within this budget (still take him there but let him do the shopping and paying), and if he learnt to manage this (with a few failures oc where you have to return the groceries bc the card got declined during checkout and you have to eat ramen for a few days - don't complain) you can give him more responsibilities. Best case he grows with the responsibilities.", "INFO: Sorry if this comes off as insensitive, just genuine curiosity, but why didn\u2019t your grandparents keep custody of your brother and would he be willing to go back now? I\u2019m not calling you an ah, but you gotta understand that he\u2019s a kid and his life was uprooted not that long ago, and he\u2019s going through his whole life without his parents, that hits so hard when you\u2019re a teenager trying to maneuver through life. I absolutely think that what he did deserves some sort of punishment. Another thing, don\u2019t force him to hang out with you when he\u2019s punished, the last thing a teenager would want to do is hang out with the guy who severed his social life for a month. Teenagers do and say stupid shit so don\u2019t take it to heart. Give him some space, and maybe let him take the playstation to his room or wherever it was before, don\u2019t make him feel like a toddler. Anyways, hope you\u2019re doing okay, please remember that you\u2019re doing your best", " NTA hold your ground I know it\u2019s hard is it possible for the grandparents to take him for a while? So he can understand what he has over here, even say that if you hate to hear so much, you could go live with the grandparents. You would know it\u2019s not permanent, but he wouldn\u2019t."]}
