My daughter is the same and even has to have breathing treatments. Your daughter has to understand you can manipulate your way to get what you want. And you made it seem that she could.

At the same time, it is your job as the parent to teach your daughter. It is entirely not socially acceptable to bring a pet everywhere. \n\nWill she bring it to summer camp? Will she bring it on vacation? Will she take it to college (many dorms do not allow pets)? Will she one day get married and take it on her honeymoon? \n\nYou support your kids when they make a choice to stand up for themselves and do the right thing. Is it the right thing to bring a pet into someone elses home when a resident is allergic? No. \n\n\n\n\nAlso, a lot of people in comments have dangerous opinions on custody. Even at 14, the vast majority of courts take a childs opinion into consideration, but the primary tenant is the best interest of the child. The court can and will go again what a child wants as both parents also have rights. This also applies to primary custody, which it appears you already have. Your ex still has rights as a parent. Parents are often punished for not facilitating custody visitation. 'My child did not want to go for xyz reasons' is an acceptable answer. But, 'my child would not go because my ex did not want a rabbit in her home for the 4 days because another resident is allergic' is generally not. That is hindering visitation. This varries by state and county, but in general, you are playing with fire on what a court would consider a power play.", "NAH.\n\nJust a shitty coincidence that her half-brother is allergic which leads to a really tough situation for both of you.

Taking it with her is not an option, and you watch the rabbit while she's at mom's. Furthermore, you are bringing an allergen that harms another child into the house, so you should be making sure clothes are hair free before sending her over.\n\nVisitation does not stop because pets are not coming. You are in charge of the pet you bought while your daughter is at her moms. You can make this a lot easier by giving her updates but denying visitation because your ex doesn't want a child to have an allergic reaction is cruel and that set up is not great for the rabbit, either. As a former rabbit owner, that situation is extremely stressful for the rabbit. Rabbits tend to like their own habitats. They also can get sick very easily. I hope you have a good exotics vet nearby because many illnesses are extremely treatable- but you need a vet familiar with rabbbits and it will set you back a pretty penny. Please do not get pets without full research- the fact you think splitting the rabbit between houses is fine for it already is making me give you the side eye on that front", "ESH, the rabbit could be kept outside in a hutch at her mother's house so it doesn't effect the brother's allergies.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
