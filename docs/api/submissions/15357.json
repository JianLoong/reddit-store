At the same time, it is your job as the parent to teach your daughter. It is entirely not socially acceptable to bring a pet everywhere. \n\nWill she bring it to summer camp? Will she bring it on vacation? Will she take it to college (many dorms do not allow pets)? Will she one day get married and take it on her honeymoon? \n\nYou support your kids when they make a choice to stand up for themselves and do the right thing. Is it the right thing to bring a pet into someone elses home when a resident is allergic? No. \n\n\n\n\nAlso, a lot of people in comments have dangerous opinions on custody. Even at 14, the vast majority of courts take a childs opinion into consideration, but the primary tenant is the best interest of the child. The court can and will go again what a child wants as both parents also have rights. This also applies to primary custody, which it appears you already have. Your ex still has rights as a parent. Parents are often punished for not facilitating custody visitation. 'My child did not want to go for xyz reasons' is an acceptable answer. But, 'my child would not go because my ex did not want a rabbit in her home for the 4 days because another resident is allergic' is generally not. That is hindering visitation.

Taking it with her is not an option, and you watch the rabbit while she's at mom's.

You are in charge of the pet you bought while your daughter is at her moms. You can make this a lot easier by giving her updates but denying visitation because your ex doesn't want a child to have an allergic reaction is cruel and that set up is not great for the rabbit, either. As a former rabbit owner, that situation is extremely stressful for the rabbit. Rabbits tend to like their own habitats. They also can get sick very easily. I hope you have a good exotics vet nearby because many illnesses are extremely treatable- but you need a vet familiar with rabbbits and it will set you back a pretty penny.

The rules were the rules wherever, but we absolutely let our daughter have some autonomy when it came to where she wanted to spend her time on a given day.\n\nHer dad passed when she was 14. I was so glad I never got into petty, bullshit arguments or pissing-contests with him over custody issues. All those petty things, the rabbits, the homework rules, the he-said, she-said crap means very little when your kid loses a parent at that age. It's absolutely horrible. \n\nI absolutely hope OP tries to create a better co-parenting relationship with his ex. Honestly,  my daughter,  now 28, tells me often how thankful she is that she never had to choose between her parents and even though we weren't together as a nuclear family, she always saw us as one big family unit - with my ex and his new spouse, and me with mine. \n\nIf both parties can put their issues aside and just focus on what is best for the kid(s), it doesn't have to be so damn hard", "Would OP have done the same if it was a cat or a dog, just ship it off to moms without a prior conversation? OP is definitely the AH for expecting his ex to take care of another living being without agreeing to it.", "Absolutely THIS. Taking the rabbit to the other parent\u2019s home should have been cleared first. OP is definitely the AH", "Yeah, really. What if it was a pet snake \ud83d\udc0d?", "Well, it sounds like he would but his daughter doesn\u2019t want to. And she has every right to say that she doesn\u2019t want to go to her moms, no matter why. So I go with NTA", "Where did it say the dad was forcing the child to take the rabbit?", "If the daughter refuses to go to her moms house w/o the bunny then she refuses to go.", "That definitely does matter, that\u2019s 4 days out of 30, give or take, that you get to see your kid.", "He won't have that conversation because it's clear from his comments that he's using this as a device to alienate the mother. He's relishing in it.", "But is the kid happy to go now ?", "I'm sure some may be educated or not particularly judgy. I just like making women feel bad for being themselves:)", "His wife obviously cheated. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t of gotten custody. I think OP should include that or explain", "but if that was the case wouldn\u2019t OP have mentioned in the post or in the comments why daughter and mom disagree a lot? especially when so many people are blaming him for the reason", "No, you were suppose to parent your 14 year old and tell her it was a poor decision to take her pet to her mom's. No is a complete sentence. You were not suppose to force an unwanted pet into the home of the other parent.", "Correct most States direct it at age 16. But the child could still be allowed to talk or write a letter to a judge of how they want to be tossed around. Joint custody is difficult and being switched between homes absolutely disrupts a kid. \nPeople are giving grief about how a rabbit responds so change of environment but seems to give no shits about how it might impact the kid.", "I agree. Plus a fourteen year old should be down to choose where they want to be. As a kid that grew up with the joint custody I wish I had more say in where I was tossed each week.", "Oh gosh. I thought I was crazy. I think so too", "Normally he\u2019d be the asshole but I think out of pride he\u2019s omitting her cheating. No way the dad gets that much custody unless the wife cheated", "With good coparents, it should never be a matter of a child speaking to a judge. Also a child of divorce, also had pets at each house - sorry your parents put you in that position!", "A snake is infinitely easier to take care of compared to a rabbit. All they do is sit in their damn enclosure and do nothing except for their weekly/biweekly feeding. Rabbits will chew the shit out of all your stuff.", "Then it wouldn't be making anyone sneeze.", "If she wanted to go to her mom's before the rabbit issue then dad is only encouraging an unhealthy attachment to the pet and using it as an excuse to avoid visitation. His line about her taking the rabbit everywhere was eye-rolling. She shouldn't be taking a rabbit everywhere. That's stressful for her pet. She should be ok being away from her pet for a weekend.\n\nIn general I agree she is old enough to decide to stop seeing her mom, but if it's due to the rabbit then I call BS on the dad's part.", "Rabbits aren't terribly common pets, at least compared to cats or dogs. I was in my 20s when I found out I was allergic to them. Went to a friend's house, she had recently adopted a rabbit, and within an hour of being there, my eyes were itching and I was super congested. The worst part was that I didn't realize it was an allergy, I thought I was coming down with a cold! It took another visit for me to figure it out.", "It matters to the mom yes, but the custody doesn't matter to this situation where he should've asked before sending it and not letting his daughter drag a poor rabbit around everywhere because they die from stress super easily.", "Rabbits are prey animals and can die from stress\n\nOP is definitely the AH", "High maintenance?  Ours is litter box trained, plays with my girls and sleeps most of the time.", "I'm not sure, but I guess you may be right.  Would a judge would take into account the half-brothers allergic reaction and tell the parents to sort it out?  \n\nWould a judge have a bit of a talk with the daughter about it?\n\nNaturally non of us a probably lawyers etc. But would honestly like to know?", "If your daughter only sees her 4 days a month then your 14-year-old daughter needs to suck it up and leave the rabbit in your care for 4 days a month. That's just how it is. If it was a Rottweiler would you still pretend that it was no big deal? Rabbits are a huge nuisance, They are not just oversized hamsters. from the tone that you've taken in all of the comments it's clear that you just want full custody and to torture this woman and maybe she deserves it but just handle it like an adult and don't come on a formum pretending like you don't know that", "Cheating or not cheating doesn't determine custody lol", "Also, you were supposed to talk with your daughter about what would happen on her mom\u2019s custody time BEFORE she got a pet. You should never have agreed to let her take it with her, and you should have made it clear to her that she would be expected to follow the custody agreement.", "A GOOD parent understands that having healthy and functional relationships with both parents is best for their child.\n\nNothing wrong with OP getting his kid a pet.  But he should have sat down with his daughter and explained that the rabbit can't go to mom's because of brother's allergies, so he'll take good care of the rabbit when daughter is with mom, but she should still go to mom's.  He knows she loves and will miss the rabbit, but it's only four days and spending time with mom and brother is important too.\n\nInstead, he's using the rabbit to basically say \"haha, suck it ex-wife!  Now I get daughter all to myself and there's nothing you can do about it!\"  He's encouraging his daughter to have a dysfunctional relationship with her mother, which is unhealthy for her.\n\nThat's bad parenting.", "You're right with good co-parents it should never go to a judge. But let's be honest most divorce parents are not good at co-parenting. It's not uncommon for there to be at least some kind of animosity. Also in a divorce you don't have to have a custody agreement. Two parents can decide what they want to do without going through court. The fact that these two have an agreement means that they went through court, and things probably weren't smooth.", "I did not know that. Thanks for the info. Not scared of snakes, but draw the line at pet tarantulas.", "My rabbit really only chewed his toys or cage. Or electrical cords if you had them exposed, so we covered them all. But that\u2019s the only house rabbit I\u2019ve ever had.", "She just got a pet and is happy and attached to it. That\u2019s completely normal. Of course they need to have a conversation about it, but lord let her enjoy her rabbit for a while. I don\u2019t say she\u2019ll stop loving it or caring, but I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be as \u201cexiting\u201d or whatever for a really long time. And maybe I\u2019d look I to the thing why she\u2019d rather spend her time with her rabbit at her dads then with her mom and brother. Don\u2019t want to shift blame or whatever, just leaves a bad taste for me if it continues for a long time.", "The rabbit aside, because that makes too much sense. If there is a court order in place where a parent gets X amount of days to see their child and that isn\u2019t fulfilled, there could be legal consequences.", "I can't imagine taking a rabbit away from the house it's living in unless it was for a needed vet visit or like you moved so you gotta move the pets too ya know. Ik I can't make assumptions but I'm imagining the girl bringing this rabbit to the mall and theater", "Exactly, I owned a rabbit and I felt terrible when I moved and had to take him in the car. Or when he went to the vet. They get stressed out very easily :( I feel really sad for this bunny, that's not a good life for it", "If it's a young rabbit, then it's being socialized to travel. My aunt kept a rabbit and brought her back and forth to work every day - she was a kindergarten and 3rd grade teacher. She was a good bunny and loved her 'job' listening to kidspractice their read aloud skills.\nShe didn't get another bunny afterward as severe environmental allergies had started being much more common.\nThere are a ton of assumptions cropping up in this one. I don't think anyone could accurately assess this AITA yet.", "I honestly don\u2019t know\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72. Honestly, don\u2019t know if someone would go to court over a rabbit, well, not really just the rabbit, but the fact that the daughter won\u2019t go without it. But me honestly wonder why the daughter only goes for days of the month to see her mother. I\u2019ve never been to court so I really don\u2019t know what would happen I guess depends on the judge.", "I think people are missing that he was obviously cheated on and is mad. It\u2019s not right but if this was a mom this whole sub would be cheering and saying fuck that ex", "Sure as fuck factors in.", "Meh. It could mean a number of things, including that she had a bad lawyer. It could mean she doesn\u2019t live in the preferred school district, so she only gets every other weekend. It could mean that she didn\u2019t have the means to provide for her daughter at the time custody was decided. It could mean that the dad was the slightly better of two bad options. They both sound awful, honestly, and the daughter is getting the worst of it. Well, second worst. The bunny has it worst.", "Where is he saying suck it to ex wife? You want him to force his daughter to go?? P", "One of the biggest things people don't understand about rabbits until it's too late, is the amount of space and clutter you need to keep them preoccupied for any amount of time. They are not animals that you can just keep in a relatively small enclosure all day every day.\n\nThey also poop like they are perpetually a 6-month-old baby. It's a LOT of cleaning if you miss even a day.", "My kids got a kitten a few days before their weekend with their dad. I assured them I'd take good care of the cat while they were gone and it wasn't an issue. Didn't even cross my mind to send it with them (dad mentioned in another post the ex hates pets so he should have known better than to send it).\n\n If the daughter wasn't declining visits before the rabbit it raises an eyebrow with me given dad knew ex doesn't like pets and claims daughter takes a pet who typically doesn't like to travel \"with her everywhere.\"", "Yeah he definitely could be", "But your attitude just supports the very dysfunction you don't want...\n\n\"I'd rather stay with X because they let me stay up late, let me eat junk food, don't make me brush my teeth or do my homework, they buy me things, etc.\"\n\nIMHO those are NOT the types of behaviors we should be encouraging.\n\nAnd one parent buying a pet without talking about it with the other parent, which ends up driving a [further] wedge between them seems selfish.", "It\u2019s recommended that rabbits not be classroom pets. An expert once told me that rabbits can get used to being in public and traveling, but it does cause stress and they will have a lower life expectancy because of it.", "Your responses in this thread have been vile. \n\nThere's no reason that bunny can't stay at your house the 4 days a month your daughter is at her mother's. But you wanted to drive a further wedge between them. Parent alienation at its finest. \n\nI hope you have the day you deserve, sir. \n\nYTA no doubt about it.", "Which you seem to be encouraging. YTA\n\nYou're not doing your daughter any favors by making her resent her mother over a reasonable restriction. It's not that she just hates all animals, this one makes her child ILL. It's not fair for you to put your daughter in that situation. You're being a terrible parent by indulging in this pettiness.", "The problem with this is no one is allergic to short hair or some else's piercing.\n\nWhen it could trigger an allergy (animals are a fairly common allergy) it should be talked about. At least to explain to your daughter beforehand that the pet should stay in your house during visitations and you could update her and send pictures.", "It actually literally doesn't. The courts don't care what happens between the parents. I know from personal experience that even spousal abuse won't affect custody as long as the courts think that the abuser can still be a good parent and just not a good romantic partner.", "custody is actually biased against women", "But it may not be her choice. Or the father\u2019s choice. \n\nIf they have court ordered custody agreement, she can\u2019t just decide not to go\u2026which is again why everyone except the bunny and the little brother are assholes here.", "Exactly. I thought every other weekend was a pretty common schedule for a non-custodial parent. It\u2019s not like she has supervised visits only.", "What kind of expert? I'm interested in reading up on what the considerations are for a rabbit. My guess would be how the environment affected the rabbit, which wasn't a huge issue when this occurred. \n\nI'm not saying everyone should do it, or that it was a feasible achievement past the late 80s to mid 90s. *But* people also keep rabbits as single pets or only feed them carrots and pellets even when we know they're happier with friends and proper hay. \n\nHer rabbit was litter trained and showed every possible sign of loving it, including an above average lifespan and forward acting personality.\n\nAgain, I'm not arguing the point about classroom pets at this point in time. The organization and the expectations for behavior that kids came in with during prior decades was very different, especially in farm and lumber country where every kid grew up around animals. \n\nShe was a very happy and sociable bunny. My aunt took her to and from school daily. She always greeted the kids and then spent the morning in her home zone chilling out with hay and snoozing.\n\nShe was she same way at home. It delighted me to no end how fast she ran through the house to greet visitors when we came over. \n\nI think schools have too many other considerations to even pull off something as simple as classroom fish now that kids' attention spans are messed up from media devices.
