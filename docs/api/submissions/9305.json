I (38M) am currently in the middle of a fight with my wife (36F) because she has planned to go away with her friends for an entire weekend next month. She didn\u2019t even ask me first, she just came home yesterday after spending time with her friends and said they\u2019re going to a luxury spa resort that is four hours away because she needed to get away from everything. I asked if I\u2019m invited and she laughed and said no, \u201cit\u2019s a girls trip.\u201d \n\nI told her if she wanted time away to relax she could have just told me and I would have planned a trip for us both to go on together. But she replied that it should have been obvious to me that she\u2019s been extremely stressed out for quite a while because of juggling both work (she\u2019s a respiratory therapist) and being a mother to our 6-year-old daughter and if I actually noticed and cared I would have planned something ages ago. \n\nTo be honest, I feel a little insulted that is kind of implying that she\u2019s the only one that is stressed out. I also work and I\u2019m a father. So I don\u2019t understand why only she get a break from all of it.\n\nI told my wife to cancel the trip because I think as a married couple we should be taking trips TOGETHER, I also told her she is acting selfish and only caring about herself. She got all shitty at me and said she\u2019s allowed to have time away with just her friends and maybe I\u2019M apart of the reason why she needs time away. Which I was offended by. I\u2019m refusing to let this go until she agrees to cancel it. I\u2019m allowed to be upset that my wife of 11 years would rather have a weekend away with her friends than with her husband.

Girly groups and blokes groups frequently come up with ideas like this and act on the spur of the moment and it may simply be that it never occurred to her that you would object.

The fact that she said that maybe you\u2019re part of the reason why she needs to get away\u2026oof. I get the feeling this scenario is one of many instances of you being controlling and narcissistic. \n\nInstead of being supportive of your wife taking a reasonable weekend getaway, you made it about yourself.

Almost like you IMMEDIATELY made this about YOU having time away rather than her being a break. YTA", "YTA\n\nIt's completely normal and healthy to take time away from your SO. It's not necessarily a sign of a deteriorating relationship, it's just nice to spend some solo time with your friends.\n\nThat said, your attitude doesn't leave much to the imagination, she definitely needs a break from you.

Whenever my ex and I took a trip together, I had to make ALL of the arrangements (childcare, transportation, accommodations, etc), and then my ex monopolized my time and expected sex on demand.  It was exhausting.  I just wanted to get away by myself where no one was pulling on me and demanding my attention all the time. Your wife should have given you a heads up before making plans, but you should be ENCOURAGING her to have a weekend with the girlfriends.  She'll come back as a better woman.  YTA", "YTA. Why don't you plan a guys trip with some friends for the month after your wife goes?", "YTA - Dude you sound toxic and controlling AF. Your wife is a whole independent peson. It's not only healthy for y'all to spend time apart, including trips - it is ESSENTIAL. She's telling you she has a need - she needs this weekend with her friend to relax and reconnect with both her friends and herself. Your response has been to vomit your insecurities all over your wife trying to get her to cancel this trip. What an awful response to someone's ask to have their need met. Nothing she's done has insinuated you're not stressed or been offensive to you - you've projected ALL of that onto her. If YOU want a weekend away then TAKE ONE! You're the only one stopping you, apparently.   \n\n\n But trying to get her to give up something pleasant because you'd prefer her to be miserable with you is unhealthy (whether that's how you mean it or not - IT'S HOW YOU SOUND.) Accusing her of offending you in order to justify your ridiculous position is unkind.   \n\n\nYou're allowed to be upset - this is true. You are NOT allowed to let your upset feelings to justify bad behavior on your end, nor do your feelings get to dictate what your wife gets to do. You two clearly have communication skills to work on, but your reaction to such a reasonable ask is beyond alarming. Sorry, dude but you are so wrong for this one.", "YTA.  What business do you have \"telling\" your wife or trying to \"make\" her do anything?\n\nIf she expects you to care for your daughter all weekend, she should have done the courtesy of \\*asking\\* you about that, but your language makes you a complete AH.", "Gentle ESH. She should have said \u201chey the girls are planning a spa weekend and I\u2019d like to go. Please make sure you\u2019re ok being alone with child.\u201d The way you talk about \u201can entire weekend\u201d as if it won\u2019t be over in the blink of an eye. It sounds very controlling.

It would\u2019ve been better if she included you in the planning process but given your reaction I see why she didn\u2019t.

Don\u2019t punish her for that", "YTA its good for her and healthy to have time apart with friends you dont need to do everything together. Im going on a weekend trip this weekend with my friends and my husband of 19 years has ZERO issue because even tho Im his wife Im still my own person and can do things without him just as he can. You need to find some friends and go on a guys trip and a weekend isnt even a long time you act like she\u2019s going on a month long adventure without you. Please dont double down on this just let it go and tell her to enjoy her trip. You and your daughter can get some good bonding time or is she\u2019ll be at a sitter for the weekend find something fun to do otherwise you\u2019re just going to push her to want more than a weekend away from YOU.", "Guys don\u2019t forget that this trip is in a month, he\u2019s mad because she didn\u2019t ask him for permission.

The more you resist this the more you're going to push her away. \n\nYou should also plan time away yourself and a trip together.", "YTA. She deserves to have some time with her girlfriends without you. You sound too controlling and this is why she needs time away. You also didn\u2019t notice (your words) that she was stressed out and needs time to be a person, not just looked at as a wife, a mother, an employee. Take care of your kid for a weekend by yourself and I am sure she will appreciate you more for the space she is taking for herself.", "I was with you when she made plans without asking first. My partner does that all the time, and I hate it. Our responsibilities are shared, so you should at least check in before dumping all the responsibilities on me. *But then* you wrote all that other stuff. She needs a break. Let her have one. She can't take a weekend away without you? I'm guessing the problem is you don't do as much as you think you do, and you'll probably find out when you have to be solely responsible for yourself and a 6-year-old for a weekend. YTA.", "YTA. By your reaction I can understand why she didn\u2019t ask you first. Yes communication is essential to maintaining a healthy relationship and she should\u2019ve run it by you (not asked for your permission. She\u2019s an adult) but she gave you a months notice. Grow up and quit neglecting and suffocating your wife.", "YTA You are controlling and suffocating and the \"you need time away too\" is a false argument you came up with because you know how ridiculous you sound. \n\nIt doesn't sound like she had any objection to you getting time to yourself. If she had, you certainly would have mentioned it.", "Yeah, you're TA.\nNo wonder she needs a break from you. \nA weekend getaway,  she deserves it.\nGrow up.", "YTA. Just by reading this I'm annoyed. You should have your own friends and space to be understanding.

You sound very clingy saying \"why can't she just have a weekend away with me\".", "YTA. Let her go have fun. My husband would never consider telling me to cancel a trip with friends. And he goes to visit friends without me. It's called being in a healthy relationship. You don't have to do everything together.", "YTA. Look, you have a kid so 100% it should be a discussion before either of you makes plans to be away. But that being said, your attitude is concerning. Of course a spouse should be allowed to have a girl/guys night or weekend. You can love your wife but still enjoy a fishing trip with the guys or getting tickets for the boys to see the big game. It\u2019s ridiculous to act like spending time without your spouse is a referendum on your relationship.

I don't want to assume because you didn't share much information in that regard, but she is speaking like someone who's feeling overloaded. I feel like you should at the VERY least evaluate that. \nAlso, consider that probably a trip with just the 2 of you without children demands another type of organization, to arrange someone to take care of the kids.\nYou can have it both ways. She can get support in other people in her life (no not just you), and you can schedule a vacation for the both of you.

I (38M) am currently in the middle of a fight with my wife (36F) because she has planned to go away with her friends for an entire weekend next month. She didn\u2019t even ask me first, she just came home yesterday after spending time with her friends and said they\u2019re going to a luxury spa resort that is four hours away because she needed to get away from everything. I asked if I\u2019m invited and she laughed and said no, \u201cit\u2019s a girls trip.\u201d \n\nI told her if she wanted time away to relax she could have just told me and I would have planned a trip for us both to go on together. But she replied that it should have been obvious to me that she\u2019s been extremely stressed out for quite a while because of juggling both work (she\u2019s a respiratory therapist) and being a mother to our 6-year-old daughter and if I actually noticed and cared I would have planned something ages ago. \n\nTo be honest, I feel a little insulted that is kind of implying that she\u2019s the only one that is stressed out. I also work and I\u2019m a father. So I don\u2019t understand why only she get a break from all of it.\n\nI told my wife to cancel the trip because I think as a married couple we should be taking trips TOGETHER, I also told her she is acting selfish and only caring about herself. She got all shitty at me and said she\u2019s allowed to have time away with just her friends and maybe I\u2019M apart of the reason why she needs time away. Which I was offended by. I\u2019m refusing to let this go until she agrees to cancel it. I\u2019m allowed to be upset that my wife of 11 years would rather have a weekend away with her friends than with her husband.

Otherwise - who the heck are you to tell a grown woman what she can and cannot do?  It sounds like you're jealous, and you need to analyze why.  Is there a reason to have trust issues?  Do you see her as property and not an independent person? Are you so insecure that you cannot bear to have your wife enjoy herself unless you are there?", "My guess is he would expect her to plan the whole trip- which is another part of that emotional burden.

It's part of healthy relationships. Having time apart isn't a negation of a marriage. I think I started having weekends away after my oldest was a year old. \n\nGranted, many of those were church retreats.

And if that did happen, you act like **ADULTS** and figure it out. Either find childcare or change plans around to accommodate both parties trips. \n\nYou ***DON'T*** say if you want a getaway plan it with me and only me, now cancel your life outside of me. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Ok, but that hypothetical is entirely irrelevant because it didn't happen and we are trying to manage what happened, not what could have happened if things were different.\n\nI can't believe he's upset after she hasn't taken a trip alone for 11 years.

That in no way negates him being perfectly capable of looking after their child all by his lonesome for 1 weekend.", "Right? Can you imagine a mother saying their child was dumped on them for a whole weekend?", "Yes. In my AITA comment I voted YTA because to me it seems she didn\u2019t run it by him because she feared he\u2019d say no just out of spite and not for a real reason (like \u201cplease pick another weekend because this one doesn\u2019t work for me for these reasons\u201d) \n\nPersonally I think if you share child rearing duties you should run plans like this by the other parent before finalising them, but he is of course TA and it\u2019s extremely off putting that he doesn\u2019t want her to spend time alone with her friends", "You\u2019re right. \n\nI think she didn\u2019t run it by him because she knew he\u2019d say no, but in general I think you should run plans that include you being away for a whole weekend by your partner if you have a child together who is young enough to need care."]}
