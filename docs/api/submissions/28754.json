{"id": 28754, "submission_id": "1763fxx", "title": "AITA for telling my bio family that I'm not going to prove myself to them?", "selftext": "I had no contact with my family for over a decade. The issues between us started in early childhood. For whatever reason they always treated me differently and I felt like the outsider. I always felt like they all resented me as the youngest of six and maybe that's why, maybe life was tougher with an unplanned kid. But then in my teens (from the age of 12) I had mental health issues. I was always getting into trouble. I was angry. I was rude. I embarrassed them in front of people and made their lives harder. When my sister brought home her now-husband I used the dinner we were having to tell him how they treated me. I ruined parties and had many meltdowns. I spiraled so many times.\n\nI was still 17 when I left. I was homeless for a while and I was in an even worse place. But I did get help and I built a family of friends who were supportive and loving and kind. I met my husband and he helped me through more steps of my journey. His family also became the family I always dreamed of having. Ultimately, I needed to go into a hospital for ongoing treatment to get on top of my mental health problems and even with all that, my work was not over. It took years of medications, therapy and psychiatry to get to a good place in my life.\n\nA year ago an aunt reached out to me and wanted to form a relationship. I didn't know her that well growing up. She was years younger than my mom and was away when I was young. Once she came into my life my parents and siblings decided we should have contact too. At first I told them I wasn't sure that was a good idea. But they told me they missed me and wanted to know me.\n\nWe spoke and I apologized for my actions in my teens. They told me they accepted. But they have been very critical of me. We have seen each other five times since reconnecting and each time they have treated me like a criminal. I understand they might not trust me but they claimed they missed me and wanted me in their lives and yet they have questioned my ability to have kids and implied I shouldn't ever have kids based off my mental health struggles. They have brought up the way I behaved in the past and said I never proved to be different. My aunt, who I am now close to, told them to leave it alone. But the second time they brought it up (the last time I saw them which was three weeks ago). I told them I do not have to prove myself to them and I told them this was why I had felt it was best we leave our relationship in the past. I said they are still treating me like shit and while I did bad things, they have never owned up to their bad behavior either and given all that, they have some nerve thinking I should prove myself.\n\nThey say I'm not taking accountability and believe I should understand I need to prove myself. They were also pissed my husband backed me up.

He saw in you a person of value who he could build a life with. He stood by you while you got through your collected traumas, opened his family to you and held faith.\n\nNow, you are back in touch with the absolute AHs who caused all of the harm. Almost as soon as you are back in contact, they are doing the same old shit. They never grew, they never learned that their actions were wrong. They are not on any kind of journey. They just missed their butt monkey and were prepared to say a few placatory things to get you back for them to pour their crap onto. They want someone broken so they can feel better about themselves.\n\nIt must be hard to stand by someone making a decision to go back to the people who hurt her so badly after all that work to get over it.\n\nI suggest you go VLC or NC unless and until you have unequivocal communication from your old family on owning their part in your childhood. It also sounds like they are acting as a group - this kind of apology should be individual and personal. Each of them has individual actions they need to apologise for. Apologising as a group is not a real apology.\n\nYour aunt sounds nice. I hope you can maintain something positive out of this.", "NTA.  The aunt sounds ok to have in your life. The rest are detrimental to your ongoing good mental health. No contact is a good choice.", "NTA - End the drama already.  There was a reason why you left them behind in the first place and it seems that not only was a wise decision but the same issues are still there.  You are in a good place now, stay there.  It seems nothing good can be had by re-engaging with toxic people coming back into your life.  Why bother, what possible reason could you have to go through all that again?  Because they are family?  Hell no. DNA doesn't always equal family.  People need to just get over that fact and move the fuck on.", "NTA. It's unfortunate that family sometimes knee-jerks to see you as who you used to be (as a child, teenager or troubled young adult) no matter how many years have passed and no matter how much work you've done to grow / improve yourself. It's a shame when they can't see you for who you are today and admire the life you've made for yourself, by yourself (and with the friends and husband you met along the way). In time, I hope they will, but keep your distance and hold your boundaries with them until / if they ever do.", "NTA. Family like that can almost never see their own actions.", "Even if the aunt is nice, it\u2019s fair to cut them all off. You\u2019re someone who has prioritized and devoted a lot to their mental health and wellbeing; don\u2019t stop now because you\u2019re in a good place. You know how hard won that battle was. NTA", "NTA\n\nThey haven't changed. Do what is in your best interest.", "NTA, not any more. As sad as it is, sometimes the families people are born into are not the best families for them. You have the right to not see them or communicate with them for whatever reason. If they come in and start being critical and bringing up the past after so much time, that's their problem.", "NTA\n\nYou walk your path alone.\n\nActions have consequences, you bear yours. They must do the same.\n\nDo what you feel is right.\n\nTake care.", "NTA.  But humans will human.  Only have as much contact as makes you comfortable.  But don't hate.  Live your good life.  Share, at a distance, that you are doing okay.  You do not have to 'prove' or 'settle'.  Use social media only, if that is helpful.  Let the Aunt share important stuff on your behalf (with your permission) with 'others'.", "Ehh, sounds like you shit the bed in your life, all over theirs. Unless you work your ass off fixing it, they won\u2019t move on. So sounds like you need too, unless you are willing to do the work. \n\nYou are all AH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's almost like they want to push you back to your old behaviors just to prove that you are still \"that bad egg\"!!!\n\nI would go back to NC or very, very LC, for the sake of my mental health.", "NTA. Congratulations on turning your life around. As for your family cut them out and run from them.", "NTA\n\nExcept for your aunt, they're all toxic and being in contact with them is bad for your health.  Cut contact and block them.", "Nta tell them and aunty to go away and if they don\u2019t legal action will be taken", "NTA.

They're not behaving like people who have accepted an apology. And until they accept that and admit their own mistakes and ask forgiveness, they will probably not change.", "NTA. Since they are the ones who wanted the reconciliation, it\u2019s on them to prove themselves to you.", "NTA. And not only that I also feel they are not good for your mental health as well.", "NTA. Your dysfunctional family are still trying to keep you in that little box labeled \u2018problem child\u2019 they had you in decades ago.  You got the help you needed, the help and support your biological family didn\u2019t give you, from other people. You don\u2019t have to prove doodly to them.", "Just because you share DNA doesn't mean that you have to be friends.  You don't even have to be in contact with those people.

But he realized pretty quickly that I was right and my doubts were there for a reason. Going NC is my only way forward really. My aunt excluded because she has been good.", "I have no reason. Even before they started their crap I had my doubts about this. Their behavior has just made me realize I should have stuck to my gut instincts.", "I don't think they will. They never saw me as a valuable person. Even before I was sick and had all the trouble I had, they weren't good to me. I don't even know why. It's hard to change what your family always sees you as, I guess.", "I have worked my ass off to make myself better. I had to do the hard work with no support from them. And I apologized for the stuff while I was sick. But the first 12 years, to them it's like they didn't treat me like shit and like none of that mattered at all. I own that I did shitty things. But they don't. And they were the ones who made the contact to reconnect. I was always doubtful this should be done.\n\nBut honestly I should have stuck to my initial gut reaction and I think no more contact will be better for all of us.", "My aunt has been good to me. I wouldn't shut her out. But the rest of them, yeah, we need to end all contact again."]}
