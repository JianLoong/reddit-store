The issues between us started in early childhood. For whatever reason they always treated me differently and I felt like the outsider. I always felt like they all resented me as the youngest of six and maybe that's why, maybe life was tougher with an unplanned kid. But then in my teens (from the age of 12) I had mental health issues. I was always getting into trouble. I was angry. I was rude. I embarrassed them in front of people and made their lives harder. When my sister brought home her now-husband I used the dinner we were having to tell him how they treated me. I ruined parties and had many meltdowns. I spiraled so many times.\n\nI was still 17 when I left. I was homeless for a while and I was in an even worse place. But I did get help and I built a family of friends who were supportive and loving and kind. I met my husband and he helped me through more steps of my journey. His family also became the family I always dreamed of having. Ultimately, I needed to go into a hospital for ongoing treatment to get on top of my mental health problems and even with all that, my work was not over. It took years of medications, therapy and psychiatry to get to a good place in my life.\n\nA year ago an aunt reached out to me and wanted to form a relationship. I didn't know her that well growing up. She was years younger than my mom and was away when I was young. Once she came into my life my parents and siblings decided we should have contact too. At first I told them I wasn't sure that was a good idea. But they told me they missed me and wanted to know me.\n\nWe spoke and I apologized for my actions in my teens. They told me they accepted. But they have been very critical of me. We have seen each other five times since reconnecting and each time they have treated me like a criminal. I understand they might not trust me but they claimed they missed me and wanted me in their lives and yet they have questioned my ability to have kids and implied I shouldn't ever have kids based off my mental health struggles. They have brought up the way I behaved in the past and said I never proved to be different. My aunt, who I am now close to, told them to leave it alone. But the second time they brought it up (the last time I saw them which was three weeks ago). I told them I do not have to prove myself to them and I told them this was why I had felt it was best we leave our relationship in the past. I said they are still treating me like shit and while I did bad things, they have never owned up to their bad behavior either and given all that, they have some nerve thinking I should prove myself.\n\nThey say I'm not taking accountability and believe I should understand I need to prove myself.

He saw in you a person of value who he could build a life with. He stood by you while you got through your collected traumas, opened his family to you and held faith.\n\nNow, you are back in touch with the absolute AHs who caused all of the harm. Almost as soon as you are back in contact, they are doing the same old shit. They never grew, they never learned that their actions were wrong. They are not on any kind of journey. They just missed their butt monkey and were prepared to say a few placatory things to get you back for them to pour their crap onto. They want someone broken so they can feel better about themselves.\n\nIt must be hard to stand by someone making a decision to go back to the people who hurt her so badly after all that work to get over it.\n\nI suggest you go VLC or NC unless and until you have unequivocal communication from your old family on owning their part in your childhood.

It's unfortunate that family sometimes knee-jerks to see you as who you used to be (as a child, teenager or troubled young adult) no matter how many years have passed and no matter how much work you've done to grow / improve yourself.

They think that after all these years a few simple apologies, a \"how are you\", and a hug(I'm probably assuming too much from them), that they think they're not just important in your life, but carry the weight of authority with them. That feeling has led them to expect to be consulted on your life, and to be allowed the right to pick and choose what you do with it. \n\nIt is highly arrogant for anyone to expect others to \"prove themselves\" to them, and take offense when others don't seek their approval. Your family well and truly needs to pull its head out of its collective asses, but sadly they won't because again they think they're important.", "You're NTA and you should go back to no contact, except with your aunt.

I am so sorry that your family of origin treats you like this. I hope your new family treats you beautifully for the rest of your days.", "NTA as other comments have said. \n\nI really empathize with you as a youngest child myself. I was mistreated by my older siblings. My parents never had the time for me. My siblings were jealous because my parents were in a better place financially and I was \"spoiled.\" But I never got true love from my parents consistently. I've even read studies that the younger a child is in a chain of siblings, the more struggles they have through life because they get less verbal and physical interaction from their parents in their formative years.\n\nDue to this I was a terror, made everything about myself, needed constant attention and melted down when I didn't get it, and the worst thing was my parents didn't have the energy actually parent me and help me through these things while correcting the behavior. I turned to sex and drugs, was kicked out, but eventually got my life together.\n\nIt took lots of therapy and medication and help from my current partner but I am in a better place and have since apologized for the way I acted. My family never cut contact with me, but I remember the times they thought I was a walking bomb, and it caused more shame and hurt to my healing than anything. \n\nHow I see it, is you are a completely different person. It is natural for them to have a reaction to seeing you, however it sounds like they have not done any of their own internal work to realize how their actions shaped your life. It is not going to help your growth and stability to be treated like a criminal when you have changed so much. Going LC with them is a good way to show them that they have their own things to work out and to protect yourself mentally. Love is the only way, shame is not how we grow.\n\nFinally, I just want to say I'm proud of you for how far you've come.", "NTA. Interesting family dynamics for sure. Just goes to show how perspectives vary and people can see the same situation differently. They certainly seem to have given themselves a pass for what was probably bad behavior, while you have admitted to your transgressions and have moved on admirably.", "\"prove yourself\"\n\nHow, exactly, do they mean?\n\nYou rebuild relationships by doing emotionally healthy things together, not browbeating someone.", "NTA", "You have mental issues that causes you to do stuff that is out of your control why didn't they get you help when you were a kid it sounds like they just want too focus on what you did and ignore all the stuff that they did to you you only have to worry about yourself not them there the assholes", "NTA. You apologized for your part in the past. That was all that was needed. It's clear you're not the same person you were and you took steps to make sure of that change. If they can't accept that then there is no need for that toxicity in your new life. Just go back to No Contact...", "NTA\n\nHave you ever asked your therapist how much of your mental health struggles is owed to how your family treated you growing up?\n\nIt is very much possible that you would have been a normal teenager if you had been raised by a normal family, isn't it?", "I read some of your comments and would like to NTA and add something: your parents are not responsible for the first 12yrs and then you became the bad guy. Your parents are responsible for all the years till now. Yes you misbehaved, but it's on the adults to check on their kids and you clearly were not ok and needed support they never provided to you. Don't let them gaslight you into the \"you were a difficult kid.\" You were a suffering one. Go NC with them, keep the aunt and, as someone already said, make sure these people won't affect your new family.", "NTA. You're not the one that wanted to reconnect. They are. Can you maintain a relatioship with your aunt and reduce contact with the others?", "Nta. Disorders like bpd and bipolar (assuming perhaps you have one or those from your details, I have both and also adhd&odd) are often caused by *environmental factors*trauma* hence why you have it and your siblings dont. Hope you go no contact with them. They sound like narcissists and horrible people.", "NTA. The things you did as an abused child should be left in the past.  The things done to you as a child by adults are another story.  They should apologize and accept responsibility.", "NTA. This is the best example of \"The blood of the bond is thicker than the water of the womb\" . You made your family with people that find value in you. You already succeeded, all these old strangers do not add anything positive to your life.", "You realise that their TOXIC behavior was the reason for your reaction? And now they are gaslighting you, and blaming you for reactive abuse? Like they were perfect and you were the problem? Hell no!", "Sorry, I had to cut details so it would all fit.\n\nI never did drugs (though almost) and didn't set fires or anything. I would sneak out of the house at night. I put myself in dangerous situations at night when a kid should be asleep. Sometimes I couldn't reign in my temper and I lost my cool. Other times I was bitter and verbally lashed out. Other times I was so depressed I was hardly functioning and wasn't doing chores or really taking care of anything.\n\nIf I was feeling bitter toward them I would make a scene at parties they hosted and would do stuff like with my sister's husband first time meeting us and talk about how shitty they treated me. Other times I would cause a scene unintentionally because I would have a breakdown (sometimes it was breaking down crying and hyperventilating and other times it was my temper).\n\nThat kind of stuff. There are things they don't know. Often times they didn't even miss me when I did sneak out so it wasn't that known to them but sometimes the cops would see me out and bring me home.", "I think a mixture of groveling and being more self deprecating than I am. I can't afford to be too bad like that. It will only bring my mental health way down. That's something I have learned.\n\nAnd you're correct. They did not seek to find out what was going on with me. They mostly just yelled at me more and got mad more. Which was what I was used to from being a little kid. Just more frequently when I got sick. Nothing I ever did was ever right.", "No, I expected them to take accountability for their actions as well. Instead you would think the first 12 years didn't happen or that I was born bad. To be honest I expected things wouldn't go great and should have decided to not engage again.", "NTAH. Maybe all this was meant to be was a reminder that you did the right thing and that you have a chosen family who loves and supports you in who you are now.  This at least will have answered any questions of whether or not they changed because you definitely have. They should be proud of who you've become, and if they can't see that, then their don't deserve the future you are creating. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Thanks for clarifying! You and your husband sound awesome. Good luck with everything. At least you have an experience of your family being AH but someone in the room standing up for you, unlike childhood.", "Not surprising, as he came from a good family, it's hard to know how toxic family can be. But you are correct, cut everyone out except for the Aunt. Be proud of how far you have come, OP. NTA", "Yep, I have had a similar situation going on 40 years with mine and haven't looked back.  It's sad, but that is the reality sometimes.", "Is normal to want to give your family a chance. Also, you\u2019ve been conditioned to see YOU as the problem so it\u2019s normal you\u2019d have doubts that they were as bad as you remembered. \n\nIt makes sense that you\u2019d give them a chance, and now you know they aren\u2019t interested in anything but you as a scapegoat. So you\u2019ll move on and not revisit them. NTA.", "If they try to contact you again, point to them that they demand you to prove yourself, but did you demand them to prove to you they're worthy of a relationship with you after all the things you had to go through due their treatment? Did they prove to be accountable for the treatment they gave to you? Because they did prove to you they never changed, they're the same as always OP. \n\nNTA and NC is the healthiest for you.", "NTA, and I get the feeling of \"yeah, should have known.\" It sounds like a mess of a situation, and I'm glad you're cutting them back off (aunt excluded). That said, I thought it worth mentioning that deciding to give them a chance wasn't a failure or a bad decision necessarily. I suspect there was a bit in the back of your mind thinking \"what if they're different now?\" And sometimes it's worth it to let that voice get the answer it needed so you can lay it to rest, and now you know.\n\nWhen I've made choices like that, even when it results in \"yeah, my instincts were right in the first place,\" I think of it as giving myself the gift of certainty. I gave them the chance, they proved my instincts right, and I no longer have any doubts about my own decision. And then I can close the book for good", "If it helps, you reaching out to see if they had changed meant you gave them a better opportunity then they gave you.\nNot that you had to give them a chance but you can now go no contact or very low contact knowing you tried, without regret.\n\nYou apologized, they claimed they accepted the apology but continued to hold your past actions against you despite their words. For all their talk of accountability, they cannot or will not admit that accountability goes both ways...they never owned up to their behavior and oddly enough are still putting the burden of proof on you.", "I mean, you probably would have had less trouble if you'd grown up in a healthy supportive environment", "As the youngest you were probably just the default scapegoat. Maybe without you around the dynamic has changed and it's causing chaos between them because they don't have a communal punching bag. That's what they probably mean when they say they miss you. They don't miss who you are as a person but the role you fulfilled in your toxic family.", "None of that is honestly that terrible. It isn't great but for them to demand groveling years later is out of line. Even without the first 12 years of the. Treating you bad. They don't have to have a relationship with you, but it seems they only wanted to.so they could use you as a punching bag.", "This just reads like a predictable reaction to your poor upbringing. Like you, I also felt unwanted in my family and developed mental health problems around puberty. I used to think there was something wrong with me, but now (and after a lot of therapy, lol) I realise that there wasn't and I'm actually a lot stronger than I'd realised because I survived. I just want to note that you wrote \"causing a scene\" and then proceeded to describe the symptoms of a panic attack. That's not \"causing a scene\", that's having a physiological response to a real or perceived threat. It's nothing to be ashamed of, and the fact that your family are holding this against you years later is reprehensible.", "you... you didn't do anything wrong. you did all the stuff an emotionally neglected child does.\n\ni'm so sorry. You're NTA. your family has bullied you then blamed you for your reaction and done it for years until they finally pushed you away - almost for good - and when you come back they go back to treating you that way? nope.\n\nget your revenge by living a fulfilling life. tell your aunt about how wonderful life is on occasion, be the gem of an addition to your husband's family that i'm sure you are, and be ready to tell any of your biological family that contacts you to pound sand.", "It sounds like you were trapped in a loveless family.\n\nNone of the things you\u2019ve described are awful on your part. It sounds like you were screaming for help and love.\n\nThey should have seen you as needing help and gotten you that help.

I am so proud that you got your feet under you and did the (very difficult) work of addressing your past and your mental health and built a family and a life for yourself from the ground up. I am so deeply sorry that your clear cries for help were ignored for so long, and I truly hope that they are never ignored again. You don't have to prove yourself to people who should have always been willing to love you unconditionally, especially because you so clearly already rock.", "You said you FELT LIKE they resented you. \n\n\nWhat did they actually do? Cus I\u2019m not seeing anything in the past that they did to you.", "Definitely a \u201cI tried it, didn\u2019t like it, never need to have it again\u201d kind of situation.

Perhaps OP actually was the family\u2019s scapegoat. If so, contact will only re-traumatize OP.\n\nOP, protect your mental health and the very hard work that you have done.

If I needed help with homework my parents would accuse me of not doing the work myself. But would gladly help my siblings. If I went for a shower it was normally the wrong time, if I asked a question it was a dumb one and I shouldn't bother them, if I was too quiet I was being sneaky.\n\nMy siblings left me out a lot. There was a sibling sporting event my elementary school held. Each of them had it too. Not one of them came. My parents never made them either. And they were all 5+ years older so the gap was probably partly to blame. But I was never worth any effort to them. Yet they were close to each other.\n\nI got dirty looks when we didn't have the money for something. It very much felt like I was being blamed for that.\n\nMy parents hardly ever took photos of or with me. There were loads of my siblings. I know of a handful of me. Just one baby photo too.\n\nMy siblings would often ignore me when I was talking to them as well and they would snap at me for watching TV when they wanted to, even if I was willing to leave. Or they would yell when I was in the office and they wanted to be in there.\n\nI never felt wanted or like I belonged with them. As a little kid I never knew why. It just sucked.", "Everything she says about how they treated her and how they talk about her now reads like scapegoat. But could also just be straight up hate/dislike and blame.

Sometimes it takes years (and sometimes never) to get over all the hurt that has been caused by someone. You admittedly had many, many problems in your youth and some might feel that a simple apology just doesn't cut it. From your point of view, you have spent YEARS doing the hard work, gotten yourself on track, and just want to move forward. Your family has not been given the same amount of time with the \"new you.\" They are stuck in the past with the \"old you\" because they haven't been given time to see that you have changed. You were allowed to change in your own time and they have to be given the same courtesy. Change is hard - not just for you, but for your family as well. So, no one is the TA here.", "I see no upside to your maintaining contact with anyone other than your aunt.  Can\u2019t you just see how they\u2019d treat any children you might have?  No, thanks.

Do you know how rare it is to have that self awareness?\n\nYou have already proved yourself, by building and maintaining long term, positive and rewarding relationships with others, and by sticking to your region of therapy, medication and self-regulation. Your Aunt sounds like a nice lady and I'm glad you have her in your life. She never hurt you and told you it was your own fault, and she never watched you suffer and refused to help. The rest of your bio family can't claim that and honestly, they sound like they suck. You don't owe them anything at all, Friend. You changed. They didn't. Please protect your hard earned peace, and don't include toxic people in the great life you've built. \n\nAnd if you decide to have kids, I can guarantee you'll be a better parent than the ones you had.

Apparently you're expected to let them treat you they way they used to only now without reacting and be grateful.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t become like that because you were throwing a tantrum. They had a lot to do with it.  The behaviors you describe are concerning and I ask, did your parents taken you to psychiatrist and psychologist? What did they do to help you. It is not normal for teenagers to have breakdowns just cause. Depression is also hard to feel as a teenager. \n\nMy advice is: have a relationship with your aunt and go no contact with the rest. You DO not need to prove anything either you are who you are now and they see it or you are not. \n\nYou have your family and friends and that\u2019s enough.

How about some accountability from them?  \nI have no idea why they wanted to renew contact with you, they seem to be trying to justify driving a 17 year old out onto the streets.   \nCut these toxic people out of your life for good. They are detrimental to your mental health.", "NTA\n\nThey are blaming you for mental health issues when you were a child.

OP, please go no-contact with your parents and siblings again. When they said they missed you, what they meant is that they missed having a punching bag. Do not be their punching bag.", "NTA.

You should trust them.", "NTA - you took a very big chance by allowing them back into your life. Unfortunately this chance didn\u2019t turn out positively.

You are better off without them.", "NTA, it sounds like NC was a great idea in the first place. I'd go back to that.", "NTA.\n\nYou might have to prove yourself if you wanted back in *their* lives. But they begged for you to reach out, you declined *because* you weren\u2019t interested in doing this this kind of \u201cmaking amends\u201d connecting.\n\nAnd part of reconnecting with someone you have a frought history with is keeping them at a distance that\u2019s comfortable.

Block them all.... now!", "It sickens me to say this, but I think what your family actually missed was their scapegoat, as long as you were around you were the lightening rod for all their toxicity, they probably turn on each other like jackals if you aren't available for them to band together against, they've all missed you because without you they have no place to pour all of their misery into. They feel entitled to treat you poorly, they don't *want* you to have made improvements in their absence, because that means they'd have to face the fact that it was they who were responsible for your behavior in the first place.

If I changed so much, maybe they did too and things can go in a new direction?\"\n\nAnd then to get there and realize \"Oh.  Okay, no matter what, this is the direction, isn't it?\" sucks but at least assures you that not going back is pretty dang valid.

It sounds to me like they swept you and your issues under the rug when you were young and they don't want to acknowledge that they failed you. My sister has serious mental health issues but we took them seriously and treated her with respect and she made it through without acting out as much as you seem to have. You have already taken responsibility of your hand in things, they need to as well. You may just need to step back until they do, if they do.
