I had attempted this exam last year too but failed.\n\nI have a college classmate who likes to go around asking everybody who gives any competitive exams if they passed or failed. We don't talk much in class just on texts and that too just work related or if she needs notes or something.\nThe 1st time she asked me about this was just after I had given my 1st attempt and found I failed. I noticed that she seemed really excited to talk about this topic and went around asking every classmate of mine who had given this exam what their results were.\nI thought that even she must have given this exam and wanted to discuss about it. But I later found that she hadn't. The way she jumped from one classmate to another so excitedly wanting to talk about it felt kinda weird to me. But I ignored it.\n\nNow, a few days before the results of my 2nd attempt were to be declared, while I was chatting with some of my friends & classmates, she came up to me again and excitedly asked me if I was waiting for the result and nervous about it or not. She also asked if this was 2nd attempt and when I said yes she got quiet and gave me look like she was judging/looking down on me. She did this in front of some of our classmates who I wasn't very close to and didn't comfortable telling this news too.\n\nAnd I was very much nervous about it. I am the type of person who puts much importance on academics, all my life I have always gotten good grades and always did well in whatever academic task I took up. \nI was so scared about this result that I put it out of my mind and had completely forgotten about it. I acted cool in front of my friends and classmates but inside I was was a nervous wreck.\n\nToday I got a message from her asking me again very excitedly if I had checked my results and I had passed or not. She already sent a congratulatory message without even knowing if I had passed or not. She may have just been being hopeful for me, but again I had forgotten about the result date and had a little panic attack reading her message. I quickly checked my result and I had passed.\nSo, a while later I texted her thanks.\nShe immediately asked to see my result page as if she didn't believe me and was acting very condescending. I told her I am not going to show her my results.\nI didn't feel comfortable sharing that with her and I had a feeling that she was just going to comment on how the marks I got very quite low or how her other friends had gotten more.\n\nI asked her why she wanted to see it and she avoided the question and just insisted that I show it to her. I refused again giving no reason why. Now she has been talking about me to her friends and our classmates that I was being rude to her and how I'm probably lying because I didn't want to show her my result\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1675512303, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tewd4/aita_for_refusing_to_show_my_exam_results_to_a/", "score": 200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if she wasn't, no one is entitled to learn your results in ANY kind of exam.\n\nEither way, congratulations!", "NTA; it's incredibly reasonable to keep your exam scores private and have a boundary, particularly when someone is acting like that. She sounds insecure.", "NtA. Stop caring about her and what she says. These are people that peak in school, and school is like less than 20 % of your life.", "She is a busybody. Nobody likes that kind of a person. You are not obligated to satisfy her curiosity. Best to ignore her. NTA.", "1.) You're not the asshole. \n\n2.) You're being gaslit. \n\n3.) Ask her why she really wants to know. If she is a go-getter academically, why would she be punching down? That's not where she finds her competition? This just comes across as though she is looking for somebody to condescend in order to validate herself. It's not an exhibit of dominance, it's just pitiful.", "NTA, sounds like she's a busy body looking to get in on other people's experiences so she can experience the emotional rush vicariously.\n\nYou did well to stand up to your boundaries, she should respect that.\n\nAs far as her talking trash, how do you want to handle that?\n\nMy advice would be to talk to a couple people about what she said about you, get the story straight, and confront her. Something like \"if you have a problem with me, you should talk to me about it.\"\n\nSet the story straight with the people you care about.", "NTA. Oof. Don't answer her questions anymore and ignore her text messages. She isn't even your friend so she doesn't deserve your time. CONGRATS!!!", "NTA, but why are you even bothering to entertain her nonsense? You passed. You know you passed. You can prove that you passed to any future employers.

Your exam results are none of her business. You have a right to protect your privacy. It is extremely rude of her to insist on knowing your test results and to see the result page. She clearly doesn't respect other people's reasonable boundaries and that is not your problem. There is no reason for her to have access to that information. Good for you in not caving in to her demands.", "NTA. I had to take a relatively high stakes exam in vet school that you have to pass to get a license. My classmates were losing their damn minds about it despite my school having a 100% pass rate on it. I got reamed for saying I didn't think it was as bad as everyone said when asked directly about it. I tried to avoid the subject entirely after that when I realized I was surrounded by very anxious, type A overachievers who would just worry and out-compete each other to death if allowed to.", "NTA - Just inform her that you are under no obligation to divulge that information with her and that since she doesn\u2019t want say why she\u2019s interested you\u2019re going to ignore her request.\n\nWho gives a fuck what the others think? It has no bearing on your performance.", "Gross. Ask her what she got and keep nagging her until she stfu.", "NTA - you need to set boundaries with this person which you're comfortable with. You don't owe them any explanation. The person you mentioned reminds me of a family member of mine who is always nosy about how much money I make or what I pay for things. And I used to tell him, but it was always me giving him answers. Likewise he wouldn't share how much he makes or even what he paid for certain things, but he always felt entitled/demanded to know my information.\n\nYou don't owe her anything, take care of yourself first.", "NTA Stop interacting with her. She personally doesn't care for you. She just wants to judge you. Maybe it was the only test she ever had a great result in and now her whole existence is to go around every year to proof herself how great she did.", "NTA. It\u2019s none of her business.", "Big NTA ! The ICAI exams are a tough nut to crack. People prepare for years before even feeling confident to take their first attempt. Took me 4 attempts to pass that shit. If anyone is going to judge you for taking TWO attempts to pass, then they\u2019re absolutely clueless about what it takes to even write that exam. You don\u2019t need that kinda negativity in your life. Cut that \u201cnot a friend\u201d out and move on with your life", "NTA People like this really grind my gears. I had a similarly annoying classmate in my program who had a photographic memory and would recite all the test questions after we took exams and then ask everybody what they answered and tell them if it was wrong. Some people just don't understand social skills", "Time to demand her results and what exams she is sitting for.  When she avoids answering why she wants to know, don\u2019t let her.  Keep asking why she wants to know.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNone of her business.", "You should excitedly run up to her and ask her why doesn't she take the test, and is she afraid to fail.  Be sure to act and speak as excitedly like she does to you and others.  Maybe then she will see the error of her ways.", "INFO there doesn't seem to be enough information here. It does sound like you were being a bit blunt or terse, but that's often okay. Maybe you're reading too much into her behavior? People from your social group who know both of you, and the local customs and expectations, may be able to give you a better answer.", "She is not their friend", "NTA. One of my best friends from grade school is absolutely brilliant. Her response was always \u201cI don\u2019t talk about my grades,\u201d even to her besties, and even though her scores blew most of ours out of the water. She taught me early on that asking is pretty gross and tacky, as is sharing for the purpose of boasting.", "NTA telling someone they are lying in order to make you 'prove' it, is a common bullying tactic. do not fall for it. It isn't rude not to share your results. Over sharing is becoming too much and people are beginning to think they are entitled to know everything.", "op=NTA\n\nNot her business.", "NTA this reminds me of a Gilmore girls episode. Is her name Paris? It\u2019s no one\u2019s business how you did besides yours. She can be upset all she wants. How dare she say she doesn\u2019t believe you. Like who does that?", "I went to university with a person like this.  When we were student teaching, she demanded to know everyone's grades.  When we were studying for our certification exam, she would argue with us about answers, then get mad when the we checked and found our answers were correct and hers were not.  \"Well, the book must be wrong.\"  When we got our final scores, none of us actually cared what the score was, just if we passed and were now certified to teach.  Not her.  It was funny, though.  Two of us (myself included) got way higher on the test and assignments than she did.  She didn't like it.", "This.  NTA.", "NTA. It's none of her business and you are not there to entertain her. And congratulations for passing! It can be double as difficult to pick up the courage once more when you haven't passed it once.", "NTA", "NTA Tell Paris Gellar to leave you alone.", "NTA. When she\u2019s in the workforce later on, she\u2019ll be the insufferable AH who asks everyone about their salary. Good for you for withholding your personal information from  lookie-loo-drama-queen.", "NTA.  As in, \"Sorry, but I think your insistence on seeing other people's test scores is a symptom of your own insecurity, and rather than being complicit in your pathology, I want to urge you to seek some counseling.  I'm sure you'll benefit and feel so much more secure about yourself!\"", "If you include nightmares about not being able to find your classrooms, or suddenly being naked in gym, it\u2019s more like 60%, lol."]}
