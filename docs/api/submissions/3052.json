And for putting fake parking tickets on cars in the employee lot on April Fool's Day. And we won't even mention what happened when I photoshopped peoples' employee badge photos into movie posters.\n\nYou need to steal it *all*, though, so there's nothing left to judge on any of the floors.\n\nYTA, of course, but *totally* justified.", "I think it's cute, but suggest just stealing the floor who won last year's decorations. That seems funnier to me. And leave one tiny ornament like they do in the book.\n\nGood luck if you go through with it!!", "Do not proceed, seems more likely to blow up in your dep face.", "YWBTA.  I think this would be hilarious, and I think most of my coworkers would too.  But you have to really know before doing it, because if you are wrong and the wrong person gets mad, it won't be pleasant for anyone.  So like all good pranks, it's only funny if everyone is laughing.  It doesn't sound like you know everyone would think it was funny, and you are worried it will upset some people, so best not to do it.", "YWBTA for taking down their decorations. I presume that some people work hard on their holiday decorations and take pride and happiness from seeing them in place.\n\nOn the other hand, your floor sounds clever enough so that you could have you fun by making respectful, non-destructive additions to the other floor's decorations.", "No judgment here because there\u2019s not really a conflict at play. Only you know your workplace so only you know how this would go over. I\u2019ve worked places where this would be welcomed and embraced by all and also at places where this would result in some write ups. \n\nStealing full displays could may be going too far imo, but bits and pieces absolutely yes. Especially if they already label you as the \u201cgrinches\u201d. Gotta have some follow up where your hearts grow 3 sizes though.", "YWBTA. If none of y'all are into it, just do the bare minimum and move on with your lives. You can't claim you don't care and then cook up a scheme like this. Either try or don't, but don't sabotage things for the people who do actually care.", "As brilliant as I find your idea, YTA for wanting to take the decorations of the other floors/offices. Just because you don't celebrate Christmas doesn't mean everyone in the company sees it like you. Maybe some people really care about this initiative. It sounds like you'll get into trouble if you steal the decorations, and it's not worthy.\n\n\rPossibly, you can do it on your own floor and with your budget: instead of buying decorations, paper your department with stick notes that say \"The Grinch was here\" or something.", "As much as I\u2019d love to see it and do think it would be funny YTA. It\u2019s still theft.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s brilliant. Maybe each grinch should mention the stolen goods to give credit to the team? like, grinch 1 holds a sign that says Marketing next to their stuff, grinch 2 Accounting etc.", "NTA - \n\nI think the biggest deciding factor for me is that you are going to take pictures of their work before you move it. If there are any hard feelings because you \"stole\" their chances at winning, you can present the pictures and give them their chance back. \n\nTBH, I also think it's pure, evil, (but playful), genius and I love it.", "It sounds like the whole thing is a one sided \u201ccontest\u201d. I think it would be a very theme based, Grinch type display, but YWBTA. This wouldn\u2019t end well for your department, and it doesn\u2019t sound like the contest is of a playful nature anyway", "I love the idea", "YWBTA and risk getting fired. If you dont want to participate, just use the money you get for decorations and spend them on snacks in \"the spirit of christmas\"", "NTA, I LOVE THE IDEA and please update us on how it goes, if it\u2019s not a fair fight then at least make it a good one", "YTA Don't do this unless you want to be unemployed for Christmas.", "NTA lol. Maybe it will make them change their ways. You still won\u2019t win tho, and they may be angry", "Yeah stealing is wrong...but that being said making it mandatory that people who don't want to decorate...decorate is shitty on the company so i guess ESH?", "If it\u2019s all in good fun then NTA; although I don\u2019t think the Judging Department will find the humor. I think it\u2019s hilarious", "I love it! I don\u2019t even care if everyone at work thinks YTA. You should do it!!! But you must report back to us because this made me so happy. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s total crap that a group participating is also the judge. Screw that!", "NTA. OMG THIS IS HILARIOUS!! Your grinch theme is freaking awesome and totally inventive. If you all lose this year you will be robbed!! I'd suggest pushing for new voting rules to be put in place... something doesn't seem right. Like each person gets to cast a vote on the best floor and they're not permitted to vote for their floor.", "YTA - Straight up you're ruining everyone else's fun just because you don't enjoy it. Also this right here is the kind of shit that's going to go and blow up right in your face. Given how you've described the office situation literally no one else at the company is going to find this in anyway amusing. Just stick to your half assed display. In other news you need to grow up a bit.", "YWBTA - how old are you? 12?", "ESH. Companies that force mandatory holiday nonsense is asinine, moreso if you're considering sabotage and theft.", "Info: Do you have camera's at your office? Would this be breaking any policies? If other people spent money of their own on the items, would that be an issue touching / moving their property?\n\nI think it might be a better prank if you set up your own \"Grinch\" theme, and them that night put some green streamers, or \"Grinch Over\" their decorations in a silly, non-damaging way without actually moving anything of theirs. (although I would see if going into another work space is even ok at all).", "YWBTA. It would be funny in the short term, sure, but you\u2019re just going to breed more resentment. Especially since your department doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with others. That\u2019s a joke you play on friends, not coworkers who barely tolerate you.

We, the Council of Grinches, shall consider this.\n\nRegarding cameras, LPC means Loss Prevention and Compliance. We know exactly where the cameras are. Additionally, we would only be borrowing items that are clearly of no personal significance and only from the common areas of the floors. All of them will be tagged for their floor of origin. Nothing would be taken from people's desks.", "I hope the Council of Grinches does something silly! I like the idea of covering other things with green stuff, or maybe even making a \"Christmas Jail\" or \"Grinchmas Box\" out of a cardboard box and putting all of their decorations in one spot of their floor.\n\nI think there is a way to do this in a silly way, to get your point across, but not come across as a huge asshole and getting fired. I think removing things from the actual area might be too far, but if it's just covered and/or moved to where they could easily put it back then no harm no foul", "I absolutely LOVE the idea, but also think you'd be an absolute idiot to go through with it because there is no way this doesn't come back around to bite you in the ass. Instead maybe say that one person from each department makes up the judging committee.\n\nYTA", "Yeah, thats going to blow up in your faces. Also, wouldn't the \"innocent\" department just pay for the crimes of the judging department, which would make YTA. \n\nWhy not make a big congratulations banner for the judging team, whom you know already will win?", "YTA - personally I think this would be hilarious and you should absolutely do it....\n\nBut in reality this could get you in way more trouble than you need and everyone else probably wont find it funny.   Also stealing is wrong and stuff.", "NTA but if nobody wants to do it then stop doing it. You keep getting pestered because you give in. Just give lip service that you'll do it, go buy a pack of candy canes, put them on a table and call it a day. You're going to lose anyway, stop caring. Even better, don't do anything and when the judges show up just say that you had stuff but the Grinch showed up and stole it all. \n\nAlso, your company is really pushing a line forcing people to participate in Christmas activities.", "YTA. You don't get a pass on stealing things because you say you're pretending to be the Grinch.", "ESH. The company shouldn't be forcing this and it definitely sonds rigged. I think your idea would be hilarious, but it has a hug potential to backfire and cause a lot of drama, so  I don't think you should.", "YWBTA - don't do that. It's shitty to the people who actually care. It sucks you were unfairly treated but this isn't an appropriate response.", "YTA and I think you should do it because I certainly would", "No judgment, this is very funny but I never recommend pranks at work, to many ways it can go wrong.", "NTA - love the idea, but think you're risking trouble.   \n  \nInstead, I'm guessing you can't outright use the money for anything other than decorating.  \n  \nSo...use the money on a bit of cheap crepe paper, stars, whatever.  \n  \nThen spend the bulk off the money on some beautiful 'holiday' themed cake/treats/etc. that you eat after but in the mean time they're decorations.", "It sounds funny but risky.\n\nWhy don't you figure out a way to celebrate the Winter Solstice and decorate for that?", "YTA, but a funny asshole.  Honestly, this sounds hilarious, but also sounds like it could blow up in your face.  I think it all depends on how seriously people take this contest, and how much you care about possibly pissing off all your other coworkers.", "I think this is brilliant", "NTA but you would probably still get in trouble. If anything why don't you decorate Winter Solstice style since that was the original holiday before the church stole the day and renamed it Christmas", "Maybe you would be TAH, buuut that would be such a baller move. I once worked in a building that had the same fl vs fl decorating BS, nobody wanted to do it, but since I have a MFA I did it, the salty office manager decided she wanted to go all hobby lobby craptastic, night before I injected her pumpkin with vinegar, and slow pictures her stupid blow ups. Childish, yes but it felt good. I say do it, if it wont get you fired and the outcome is you are never asked to do it again.", "YWBTA but I like the idea. Personally, I\u2019d suggest making small additions to the other floors layouts. Loads of santas on display? Tape pictures of the grinch over the santas. Hang mistletoe over stupid areas like the photocopier. Someone\u2019s got a small angel/figurine out on display? Jello it. Simple stupid things that won\u2019t be a pain in the ass to fix", "I think it's hilarious and a great way to play on your theme! But I don't think it'll play out as well as hoped... I'd just wait until everyone left and decorate it.. but the voting group shouldn't be allowed to vote for themselves", "YWBTA. But, a totally justified one. I would do similar, but then again I am a bit of an arsehole.", "The idea is hilarious.\n\nBut I doubt the reality would be.\n\n\"A prank is only funny if everyone is laughing, etc...\". These people don't sound like they'd laugh. More like they'd get really bent out of shape. And that could have real repercussions for your department. \n\nUse your creativity on your floor. The Grinch-stole-it motif there, or a pitiful Charlie Brown tree, or a winter holiday that is clearly NOT Christmas.", "Nope.  Have fun", "Yep, OP must steal everything, even their last can of Who hash. (Is who hash made of whos? Are they cannibals?)", "I think this is great but maybe not the best plan (as others have said)\n\nYou could instead all dress up like (or wear labels that say) Scrooge and just refer to everyone in your office as Ebineezer Bob/Mike/Alice/(Insert name here) for the day of judging? (With the budget just buy some mint humbugs and a sheep bowl? Shoutout to pun lovers)\n\nOr go out and buy all the discounted Halloween decor you can find and make it the nightmare before Christmas\n\nEither way you\u2019re decorating and also probably mucking up their vision of Christmas sparkle", "Eh if they actually cared the team doing the judging wouldn\u2019t be the winners every time lol", "Right, yeah. The team initiating and judging the competition obviously care very much. OP claims his team does not, but wants to scheme a way to ruin it for them. At best OP cares a little more about this than they let on, and at worst their primary motivation is to hurt/humiliate/anger the other team. A bad look either way.", "While funny, I think there are too many possibilities for it to go wrong and to end up in hot water. ESPECIALLY as Loss Prevention and Compliance. Even covering things up, someone is going to get salty. Best to reserve your inside jokes to your own area, as much as the other would be fun.\n\nYour energy is best directed at suggesting a new voting system. Everyone votes, or a committee made up of a few different departments, etc.\n\nThat said, I would LOVE to see how Allison Green of Ask a Manager would answer this! Submit it!", "He doesn't care about winning.  He cares about them losing.", "Right. Which is an asshole thing to do!"]}
