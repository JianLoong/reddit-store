Your mum shouldn't try and guilt you like this. She's being a bad parent.\n\nHOWEVER:\n\nYou need to learn the value of sharing. \n\n Rather than spending the whole Xmas break guarding your items from your siblings and building up resentment between them, try leaning in. By this I mean, engage with your siblings on your terms. Yes, those are your presents, and they don't have a right to use them, but if you let them use them occasionally, your life will be much easier and happier.\n\nSay, tomorrow afternoon we can take turns on the PS4. Or on Christmas eve we can play on the Ipad. Rather than stressing about if they'll steal your ipad or play the PS4 when you're in the shower, you'll find that they're not so bad. And all of you will have a better Xmas for it.", "Being inconsiderate of the feelings of others... sounds like yta, alright. Next time bring something else to entertain yourself, or maybe get to know your siblings better.", "YTA if it was a rule and you broke it than that's your choice. She gave you an alternative compromise after you broke that rule and you still refused (which is understandable cause I get tht younger kids will break stuff). That being said refusing the compromise means you get your stuff taken away I think that's fair. \n\nHowever I do think its unfair to have you be bored at her house just because of that rule. Maybe you and your mom could come up with a way to have you have your stuff, but only during an alloted time where the other kids won't be jealous so you can also enjoy part of your time there. Idk create a situation where everyone can be a bit happier, someone can probably come up with a better idea than mine.\n\nAlso since I am an adult now its funny to see teen behavior like this. I probably would've agreed with you as a teen, but I realize now as an adult that your mom probably just loves you and wants to spend time with you thinking you'll have fun but majority of teenagers inevitably push their parents away during that time of life and want privacy. \ud83d\ude05 Honestly I did the same thing growing up and now I love spending time with family, well most of my family.\n\nEdit: and actually now that I think of it, if the other kids are jealous isn't that a good chance to teach them to save money they get from birthdays and Christmas to get things they want?", "YTA for being a spoilt brat and thinking that just because some of them are half siblings, they should be treated differently.\n\nKindness is free. It's already tense enough to have a divided home, so if you don't want to share your stuff with them and you think your mother's place is boring, do them a favour and don't show up.\n\nHoping your ipad and your PS4 will be enough when your siblings want nothing to do with you. This is childish behaviour. There's still hope for you. Once you're older, you can be a better person.\n\nOr maybe not. But you're asking, so be ready.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Feel good that you're bringing some Christmas cheer to the world.\n\nI suspect that when you're older, you'd have much better memories of a Christmas shared with your siblings, than a Christmas spent hogging your toys to yourself.
