By this I mean, engage with your siblings on your terms. Yes, those are your presents, and they don't have a right to use them, but if you let them use them occasionally, your life will be much easier and happier.\n\nSay, tomorrow afternoon we can take turns on the PS4.

Maybe you and your mom could come up with a way to have you have your stuff, but only during an alloted time where the other kids won't be jealous so you can also enjoy part of your time there. Idk create a situation where everyone can be a bit happier, someone can probably come up with a better idea than mine.\n\nAlso since I am an adult now its funny to see teen behavior like this. I probably would've agreed with you as a teen, but I realize now as an adult that your mom probably just loves you and wants to spend time with you thinking you'll have fun but majority of teenagers inevitably push their parents away during that time of life and want privacy. \ud83d\ude05 Honestly I did the same thing growing up and now I love spending time with family, well most of my family.\n\nEdit: and actually now that I think of it, if the other kids are jealous isn't that a good chance to teach them to save money they get from birthdays and Christmas to get things they want?", "YTA for being a spoilt brat and thinking that just because some of them are half siblings, they should be treated differently.\n\nKindness is free.

And people who complain they don\u2019t have that much money should try using birth control or get an abortion. People having multiple kids from multiple people then complaining they have no money is comical. Which I\u2019m sure is why your dad didn\u2019t care if you and him broke your moms rule.

But bringing a console that I\u2019m assuming uses the family tv unless you have your own tv in your room there is flaunting it to younger kids.\n\nYour mom doesn\u2019t have the right to tell your dad what gifts to give or what you have at your house, but she does have the right to restrict what comes over to her house.", "ESH\nI grew up in a similar scenario.  You knew the rules.  If you didn\u2019t want to share something you shouldn\u2019t have brought it. You probably could have left the PS4 at home and flew a bit under the radar.  I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to share. You went into this knowing there would be a conflict.  \n\nThat being said, if your mom wants to see you she needs to also understand if you are bored you will stop spending time at her house.  Yes they are technically your siblings, but obviously you aren\u2019t keen on a relationship with them. Forcing you to spend time with them is only driving a bigger wedge.  I doubt they are thrilled to see you either.", "In my opinion, the mistake was in bringing the ps4 without offering to play multiplayer games with your siblings. Everything else, including the iPad, I can absolutely see justification for bringing. If you offered to let them buy their own controllers and play multiplayer with you, you control the console and make sure it doesn\u2019t get broken. Or leave that one at dad\u2019s. You can alleviate the boredom with just the iPad for the holidays. \n\nFamilies are complicated, especially when there are step-parents and siblings involved. Sometimes adults do not see how they are favoriting one sibling over the others, and sometimes they do see it but have justified it to themselves. Your mother\u2019s upset at your father should not have translated into you being treated poorly. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be intentionally cruel to your siblings either. And I do think it was intentional- but as a jab back at your mother, not them. \n\nI\u2019m not saying they are completely ignorant of the dynamics either, but they are children, like you. 14 doesn\u2019t feel like childhood probably, but it is still very much a part of growing up and learning to navigate the world, emotionally more than anything else. \n\nWithout being defensive, ask yourself what you are most upset about. I always recommend writing it out on paper and just letting the words come. When you\u2019ve gotten it all out, write a letter to your mom or dad with the important bits - the ones that are truest for you. Adults forget what it was like to be teens, and especially if they didn\u2019t have step families they may not understand how it all makes you feel. \n\nI like letters because you can practice what you want to say until it is right instead of just emotional.", "ESH. I don\u2019t think you should share your personal belongings because they are yours. But I also don\u2019t think it was too unreasonable that your mom request that you keep those things at your dads. It\u2019s not your siblings fault that mom and step dad can\u2019t afford the same things just as it\u2019s not your responsibility to entertain them. You\u2019d been fine I think with just the iPad and headphones but console was too much. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to care about them or for them. But courtesy can go a long way in the long run. Just think about it at least.", "Your mom did make a simple rule to respect everyone\u2019s well being. \n\nI think it is fair to ask you only bring things you\u2019re willing to share over to hers. It is a household with many siblings (vs what you\u2019re used to at Dads as an only child I guess\u2026).\n\nAs a mom, I\u2019d have focused on you recognising the above - and the fact family time can be boring maybe, but finding outs isn\u2019t the way. Find ways to entertain yourself there or ideally with them where there are commonalities. \n\nI cannot comment on how your mom spoke and handled things based on what you wrote. I do sense the angst you feel and that you\u2019re a strong personality perhaps defiant/aloof idk. I just suggest you reflect and try and have the best holiday possible with the family you were dealt.\n\nIf they\u2019re actually abusive and unreasonable in their communication or care for you, then definitely raise it with counsellors or ask to get therapy etc. Take care of your mental and overall well being.\n\nI would not call Dad to fight my battles if there\u2019s no bigger issues, only cause you\u2019re then making it difficult for them to coparent if they\u2019re fighting over you not respecting courteous boundaries they set etc. I know kids can use that to their advantage, just be careful not to misuse it.\n\nHappy holidays NAH for now, just try and be part of the solution too\u2026sucks we have to share in bigger families so work out how you\u2019d be able to cope better/adapt.", "YTA\n\nCome on now.

Knowingly breaking rules, rubbing expensive gifts in the faces of those who have less, not caring how other people feel, and causing drama over the holidays is all asshole behavior. Being a teenager is not an excuse. This is the age when OP should be learning *not* to act like that. If you excuse asshole behavior for a teenager, all you do is create an asshole adult. People don't suddenly sprout empathy and awareness on their eighteenth birthday. I can't believe this is top comment somehow.\n\nOP, you have siblings and their feelings *do* matter. If you don't want to share something, keep it at the other house. Your mom made that rule for a reason and it's a good and reasonable rule for a blended family, and you are acting like an asshole by breaking it and crying to your dad to get out of the consequences.

However showing off to rub it in peoples faces is still an AH move. So for that I have to say ESH. You are justified tho since your mom created this mess.

Does she have a tv in her bedroom (where it would be reasonable to restrict access to her siblings), or did she hook it up in the living room, monopolize the family's tv, and still not allow her siblings to play (which is absolutely an asshole move for monopolizing community space and resources while still resource hoarding your own).", "It's not somebody else's house????????????? It's her home???????? This is how split custody works what the fuck lmao\n\nOp isn't visiting some family friend, she's going to stay with her *mom*", "Agree.

Why not play a game with your siblings?", "> You would agree though it's a bit strange to bring a whole console to someone else's house\n\nYou mean her own home?", "It\u2019s not strange at all to bring an entire PS4 Consol over to someone\u2019s house. My niece is in her late 20s and brings it to my parents house all the time when we get together for holidays and stuff so she can play games and I can play games with her.", "But it's not \"someone else's house\" it's in essence OP home just as much a his dads is.\n\n\nWe lugged the 64 my dad got us back & forth every time we switched houses.", "Also like sharing a PS4, how is that really going to break besides a controller? Which tbf sounds like dad could afford to replace, not that he should have too.", "If siblings have a history of ruining belongings, tho, this becomes reasonable. Also, it depends where these objects are. If they are in OP's room, for example, sharing means opening up her personal space, which is definitely not normal of ac14 year old or expected.\n\nForcing the behavior is also not the answer because it's way more likely to make a kid territorial of belongings growing up.\n\nFurthermore, mom and stepdad are encouraging an unhealthy environment by essentially forcing one kid to have a high degree of separation between homes. At 14, two different sets of personal belongings are unfeasible and it's normal to bring items back and forth. This is a person with agency and preferences. Forcing an unequal environment just makes the kid prefer one over the other more. The goal of a split couple should be to make transitioning to houses as seamless as possible", "OP is 14. There is a responsibility among the adults responsible for her to actually make the transition between the 2 houses less difficult. One set is not interested in doing so. Parents need to be encouraging positive relationships between the kids, not forcing one kid to modify their behavior for the benefit of others, especially when it's likely not going the other way because the youngest are not in the same situation as OP and get to enjoy their parents together without switching households.\n\nOP gets material things in exchange for less personal comfort. Mom has not seemed to realize that. At least letting her take things back and forth gives her consistency. The current dynamic is pretty unhealthy for a 14 year old. The goal should be for planning more activities with all siblings together so they have a better relationship. It's a bit telling that the 14 year old describes holidays at one house as boring- normal for a 14 year old, but also potentially indicative of activities being mostly geared to the younger kids that permanently live there and less to the older siblings. This typically ends with strained sibling relationships if that's the case, especially when the older siblings are already absent for chunks of the time", "Unless she has a TV in her room, then the demand is to bring the younger kids into her personal space", ">\tA 14 year old I get, but everyone else in the comments? \n\nI always forget this but there are lots of teenagers on Reddit", "Haha yeah you\u2019re right the more I\u2019m on here I\u2019m seeing that it\u2019s like 50/50 lol", "I think they did a poll once and found a lot of us are 17-21.", "after knowing how it feels, shouldn't you act differently?", "Maybe mom should be paying child support. That'd be a nice  xmas present for her. or perhaps you should give her one where you go nc and just live with dad. I'm sorry but is there anything to be gained by being around your mom? She sounds awful and self centered.", "Hey OP, INFO:\n\n1. Have you always lived with your dad?  Have you always had better material things than your half siblings?\n2. Do you have a relationship w your half siblings at all? Good, bad, neutral.\n3. Do you NOT want to go over to mom\u2019s anymore?\n4. Has mom treated you well in the past, or no?", "So here's the thing. An iPad and a charm bracelet are single person items. You can't wear the charm bracelet at the same time someone else is wearing the charm bracelet. Most iPad games are single player games. I could see you bringing those things with you and reserving them for your own use.\n\nBut the PlayStation is, generally, a multi person game device. Most games allow more than one person to play. I think it's reasonable to bring the PlayStation to your mothers house with the expectation that your siblings can play **with you**. I don't think it's necessary for you to allow them to play it if you're not playing as well, and certainly if they wanted to, they would have to ask for permission, but it's not unreasonable to expect all of you to gather in the living room and play together.\n\nThis is especially true since you're hooking the PlayStation to the communal TV.\n\nHowever, your mother and her husband are allowed to have rules about electronic games in their house. And you don't get to violate those rules just because your other parent gave you electronics.\n\nThe thing is, you have a very selfish mindset. Now, children seem to be inherently selfish and have to learn to be generous. Some people think that only children are inherently prone to selfishness because they don't have siblings, but only children can be taught generosity with intention. (I realize that you have siblings, but because you are the only full sibling of your mother and father, there were probably times when you were the only child in the house and received all of your parents attention.)\n\nI think you have a lot of animosity toward your half siblings. And I understand that sibling relationships in blended families can be very difficult. But it's not clear to me\u2014and I haven't read all of your comments\u2014that there's a reason for this animosity outside of the fact that these are not people that you live with full-time.\n\nIn your life, you are likely going to have to live with and work with people with whom you do not feel a strong personal connection. This will happen especially in your working environment. One of the best skills that you can develop that will advance whatever career you choose is the ability to deal kindly with people. Being the person who comes back from a trip to New Jersey with a box of salt water taffy for the break room, or who offers to fetch a bottle of water from the office fridge, since you're getting one for yourself, goes a long way toward generating a feeling of community between people. And the purpose of community is to help other people and be helped in return.\n\nBack when I worked in an office and saw my coworkers every day, there were times when on my way into the office I would stop and get a lox and bagel sandwich. When I did that, I would always text my other coworkers and see if they wanted bagels, and I would bring them some. ;Notice that i bought them bagels and cream cheese, not a sandwich like my own. The equivalent of letting your siblings play PlayStation *with you* but not leaving it there when you went to your dad's.) It only cost me a few dollars but it brought me goodwill. Let me tell you, I have always gotten quick help with things I can't handle, because people have a good impression of me.\n\nI'm going to suggest you read a few books by Chris Crutcher. I especially liked *Whale Talk*, *Period 8*, *Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes*, and *Deadline*. I think you should also watch the movie *Fly Away Home*. I think you should think about what sort of young man you are growing up to be, and what sort you *want* to be.", "She doesn't have a TV in her room. When asked about it, OP said \"they don't watch much anyway\".", "Why did we develop empathy? Why do we live in a society?", "One item to pass the time I understand, but the charm bracelet is for....? Nothing. It's for nothing but rubbing in her siblings faces. \n\nAnd it's her mom's household rule. Parents are free to have stupid rules, OP defied that openly and flagrantly.\n\nBringing in all her new shit with a weak excuse and upsetting her mom for no damn reason is enough to make her the asshole. \n\nI would have either had her put it all on a top shelf in a storage closet for the duration of the visit or asked the dad to come pick it up.", "Wow, yeah you\u2019re just an asshole.", "I\u2019m also curious about her relationship with the step dad (I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s still involved with the mom). He\u2019s known OP since she was roughly two. If he was living with OP, seeing how her dads lack child support hurt her, and still spoiled his kids while giving nothing to her I\u2019d say her pain makes a lot of sense. If I spent my childhood with an \u201cevil stepparent\u201d type that didn\u2019t give a shit about me but poured their all into my younger siblings, while my mom effectively told me to get over it\u2026 I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve never been in that situation.", "You could try just bringing the tablet.

To which I say, tough. No one is entitled to be an only child.~~ (Misread the older sibling's relationship.) Having siblings means constantly interacting with people who didn't choose you any more than you chose them, and guess what? That's life. Deal with it. What you *can* choose is whether you treat them with empathy and respect or not. OP is consciously choosing not, and their whole family knows it. \n\nOh, and their dad is a bonus asshole for enabling their behavior.

Maybe mom gives preferential treatment to OPs half siblings, maybe they don't get a choice whether they go to their mom's or not. Maybe OP is expected to do the childcare work in the past and there is resentment there.\n\nAll to say, the OP does not owe anything to their half siblings. Their mom birthed them.

They learn by example, if they see someone being a brat, they\u2019re just gonna copy them. It sucks and its not nice, but its also not their fault. You are 14 however, you are old enough to know right from wrong and yet you are CHOSING to be an asshole. Why?

Of COURSE they can't handle the fact their sister gets much nicer things and they don't because they can't yet truly understand about financial issues and will just end up feeling like shit.

So they always had more, she always had less, and now that SHE'S getting stuff mom is forcing her to share with the siblings despite them not having to share with her. \n\nSo yes, they treated her differently/poorly and now that things have changed they have already pushed her away and did damage to the relationship.  She is just responding in kind to the way they treated her.", "That's not fair to the other children either. Child support is so they can live equal lives at either parents house.

If mom has a problem with that she can send you back to your dad's.", "Putting a man on child support typically means giving him rights to the child, custody, and input on schooling, medical care, geographical location, and how they're raised.

Since the comment of \"no child support\" comes, I assume that the eldest one's dad paid a lot in child support and that's where the bragging came from.

They don't belong to her, and the person who paid for the items wouldn't tolerate it. Nor should he.
