By this I mean, engage with your siblings on your terms. Yes, those are your presents, and they don't have a right to use them, but if you let them use them occasionally, your life will be much easier and happier.\n\nSay, tomorrow afternoon we can take turns on the PS4.

Maybe you and your mom could come up with a way to have you have your stuff, but only during an alloted time where the other kids won't be jealous so you can also enjoy part of your time there. Idk create a situation where everyone can be a bit happier, someone can probably come up with a better idea than mine.\n\nAlso since I am an adult now its funny to see teen behavior like this. I probably would've agreed with you as a teen, but I realize now as an adult that your mom probably just loves you and wants to spend time with you thinking you'll have fun but majority of teenagers inevitably push their parents away during that time of life and want privacy. \ud83d\ude05 Honestly I did the same thing growing up and now I love spending time with family, well most of my family.\n\nEdit: and actually now that I think of it, if the other kids are jealous isn't that a good chance to teach them to save money they get from birthdays and Christmas to get things they want?", "YTA for being a spoilt brat and thinking that just because some of them are half siblings, they should be treated differently.\n\nKindness is free.

And people who complain they don\u2019t have that much money should try using birth control or get an abortion. People having multiple kids from multiple people then complaining they have no money is comical. Which I\u2019m sure is why your dad didn\u2019t care if you and him broke your moms rule.

But bringing a console that I\u2019m assuming uses the family tv unless you have your own tv in your room there is flaunting it to younger kids.\n\nYour mom doesn\u2019t have the right to tell your dad what gifts to give or what you have at your house, but she does have the right to restrict what comes over to her house.", "ESH\nI grew up in a similar scenario.  You knew the rules.  If you didn\u2019t want to share something you shouldn\u2019t have brought it. You probably could have left the PS4 at home and flew a bit under the radar.  I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to share. You went into this knowing there would be a conflict.  \n\nThat being said, if your mom wants to see you she needs to also understand if you are bored you will stop spending time at her house.  Yes they are technically your siblings, but obviously you aren\u2019t keen on a relationship with them. Forcing you to spend time with them is only driving a bigger wedge.  I doubt they are thrilled to see you either.", "In my opinion, the mistake was in bringing the ps4 without offering to play multiplayer games with your siblings. Everything else, including the iPad, I can absolutely see justification for bringing. If you offered to let them buy their own controllers and play multiplayer with you, you control the console and make sure it doesn\u2019t get broken. Or leave that one at dad\u2019s. You can alleviate the boredom with just the iPad for the holidays. \n\nFamilies are complicated, especially when there are step-parents and siblings involved. Sometimes adults do not see how they are favoriting one sibling over the others, and sometimes they do see it but have justified it to themselves. Your mother\u2019s upset at your father should not have translated into you being treated poorly. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be intentionally cruel to your siblings either. And I do think it was intentional- but as a jab back at your mother, not them. \n\nI\u2019m not saying they are completely ignorant of the dynamics either, but they are children, like you. 14 doesn\u2019t feel like childhood probably, but it is still very much a part of growing up and learning to navigate the world, emotionally more than anything else. \n\nWithout being defensive, ask yourself what you are most upset about. I always recommend writing it out on paper and just letting the words come. When you\u2019ve gotten it all out, write a letter to your mom or dad with the important bits - the ones that are truest for you. Adults forget what it was like to be teens, and especially if they didn\u2019t have step families they may not understand how it all makes you feel. \n\nI like letters because you can practice what you want to say until it is right instead of just emotional.", "ESH. I don\u2019t think you should share your personal belongings because they are yours. But I also don\u2019t think it was too unreasonable that your mom request that you keep those things at your dads. It\u2019s not your siblings fault that mom and step dad can\u2019t afford the same things just as it\u2019s not your responsibility to entertain them. You\u2019d been fine I think with just the iPad and headphones but console was too much. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to care about them or for them. But courtesy can go a long way in the long run. Just think about it at least.", "Your mom did make a simple rule to respect everyone\u2019s well being. \n\nI think it is fair to ask you only bring things you\u2019re willing to share over to hers. It is a household with many siblings (vs what you\u2019re used to at Dads as an only child I guess\u2026).\n\nAs a mom, I\u2019d have focused on you recognising the above - and the fact family time can be boring maybe, but finding outs isn\u2019t the way. Find ways to entertain yourself there or ideally with them where there are commonalities. \n\nI cannot comment on how your mom spoke and handled things based on what you wrote. I do sense the angst you feel and that you\u2019re a strong personality perhaps defiant/aloof idk. I just suggest you reflect and try and have the best holiday possible with the family you were dealt.\n\nIf they\u2019re actually abusive and unreasonable in their communication or care for you, then definitely raise it with counsellors or ask to get therapy etc. Take care of your mental and overall well being.\n\nI would not call Dad to fight my battles if there\u2019s no bigger issues, only cause you\u2019re then making it difficult for them to coparent if they\u2019re fighting over you not respecting courteous boundaries they set etc. I know kids can use that to their advantage, just be careful not to misuse it.\n\nHappy holidays NAH for now, just try and be part of the solution too\u2026sucks we have to share in bigger families so work out how you\u2019d be able to cope better/adapt.", "YTA\n\nCome on now.

You're mom's reasoning shouldn't be because you got nicer stuff it should be\"  if you want to keep your stuff nice and not share... keep it at dads.\nyou already know if your siblings accidentally break something your mom can't afford replace it. So yeah the console was a bit much.\ni don't know if you have your own room &TV at your mom's. \nIf not then yeah Your kinda TA to expect to set it up in front of them and it not be a problem.but you're also 14 ... Kinda expected at this age lol", "Nts", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for parents to ask you to leave your belongings at another parents house just because it was purchased by that parent. \nOnce a gift is given it is yours and you should be able to keep it wherever you please. \n\nIf you had your own room and a tv that you could set up your PS4 then I think it\u2019s fine for you to close the door and play by yourself. But if you are occupying a common space then it\u2019s rude to assume you can have that to yourself and not share. \n\nYour mom obviously feels bad about not being able to give the same to your siblings as you are receiving from your father and she is trying to find a way to manage that. \nIt\u2019s hard to understand some of these dynamics as a kid but try not to take it all personally. There\u2019s no manual on parenting and they don\u2019t always get it right.", "NTA", "You would agree though it's a bit strange to bring a whole console to someone else's house, set it up and play with it and then refuse to let anyone else use it?\n\nIt would be NTA for me if OP had just brought the iPad and bracelet, because honestly it's really not her problem what her mother can and can't afford, but you can't convince me they couldn't go without the PS4 until they got back to their primary home.\n\nThere's an element of OP not owing her siblings anything, but there's also an element of teaching someone not to be an asshole all their lives which this feels like the beginning of.

Are her stepsiblings dickish to her? Probably. But honestly, this entire situation is a freaking mess. She takes her gifts over to lord them over the less fortunate (read her comments, this is exactly what she is doing) and heavens forbid they retaliate and break or steal something. It would have been better to leave the things at home. Her mom wouldn't pay to replace the stuff.", "[removed]", "Why should OP care about her half-sibling's feelings? The relationship she has or does not have with them is her choice.\n\nIf she has a TV in her room she can absolutely hook it up and not share, expecting to do it on a communal TV ehh not so much and mom can definitely say no to hooking it up.\n\nSort of sound like OP doesn't enjoy her time at her mom's and needs and wants something to pass the time.", "It\u2019s OPs gifts and she should be able to decide if she wants to allow her siblings to play with them or not. Younger children can be careless and destructive. They also can\u2019t control themselves and will sneak to play with the stuff when OP is not around. Setting boundaries is ok.

I\u2019m sorry about that, you don\u2019t deserve that. I think I should also take into account that you\u2019re 14 and having a mixed family/separated family is rough. I totally get wanting to just lock yourself in your room and play ps4 etc. it seems like maybe you don\u2019t feel comfortable at your moms. That makes sense, I get it. I\u2019m not sure if your siblings are actively MEAN to you or not, but if it\u2019s just your mom that is maybe realize they don\u2019t have the best life either. I also wouldn\u2019t want my stuff broken and I get how young kids are, but maybe if you supervise them it will be okay and hey maybe you might even have fun playing like a two player game or something.", "You should add this part to the original post.
