I understand wanting to create a routine, but he also is trying to create a routine, and work takes precedent. I get so frustrated on our days off when my boyfriends alarms still go off because he forgets to turn them off. That's basically what's happening here. Now, I'm not saying either of you should sleep on the couch, as that's not a sustainable long term solution. However, he has already tried ti compromise wearing ear plugs, so maybe you can try a different type of alarm. Maybe set it to vibrate and put it under your pillow. \n\nAlso, from your comments, breaks at work are NOT the same as getting sleep st home. It's a little dense of you to think that. Final comment: if it's taken you months to create a routine, and you still need an alarm, and you're not even getting up with your alarm, then are you really creating a routine? Or are you creating a hill to die on?\n\nETA: you purposely left out a bunch of vital info full well knowing it would make you the AH. This makes you a double AH.", "How about YOU sleep on the couch those days?\n\nYTA is my call, you are sleeping through this AND disrupting his sleep.", "YTA.  Your bf is an AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER, he's responsible for thousands of lives.  This is one of the most stressful jobs on the planet, with the highest burnout rate.  He NEEDS to sleep well and be fully rested.  It's his JOB.  YOU sleep on the couch. You're not talking about alarms for a job, you're talking about going for a run, there's no comparison, especially when you can't even be bothered to get up for it half the time. \ud83d\ude44", "YTA\n\n**Edit: I just saw another reply from OP when someone asked what her BF's job is, and she said air traffic controller. I'm doubling down on my YTA. You're 1000% the AH.**\n\n**I'm an air traffic controller and let me tell you, rest is extremely important. Extremely. We are literally communicating and making sure all of you are safe while flying. One wrong move from an air traffic controller can have disastrous consequences.**\n\n**I suggest you read** [this article about flight 3352.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroflot_Flight_3352) **178 people died largely because an air traffic controller fell asleep on the job.**\n\nMight be an unpopular judgement but here are my reasons (italics are comments from OP):\n\n*Yes he's tried earplugs but he can still hear the alarm. It's kind of important for me to keep the alarm so I can actually stick to the routine. Right now I'm only actually waking up early to run a few days, but I want to do it every day so the alarms help me get into it.*\n\n*Also he gets multiple breaks during his shifts, but he said that's different and he needs to be rested well before he goes*\n\nHe's already using earplugs and it's not working. Might be because he's a light sleeper or the alarm is very loud.\n\nBut the biggest point here is that OP is **trying** to wake up every day, but she actually doesn't. She only runs a few days a week.\n\nEven from the main post, it says \"I can **try** to go for a run with my friends\" and that the BF said \"he needs to rest, and **I don't get up**\"\n\nSo you're waking your BF up but not getting up yourself. It's also not every day, just the 2 days he has afternoon shifts.\n\nOP - turn the alarm off, or sleep on the couch yourself.", "YTA. He needs to sleep for work, and if he is doing shift work on different shifts a week, he definitely needs to be able to sleep well. You want to wake up early, but you don't need to. I feel like you are being selfish, expecting him to sleep on the couch because you want to start a new routine.", "YTA you wrote in your post that you don't actually get up. If that's the case, then there's no point to the alarm. If there is a point to the alarm, you can sleep on the couch just as easily as he can.", "According to the OP her boyfriend is an air traffic controller.  .\n\nGuess what?  His lack of sleep is now everyone's problem. \n\nYTA \n \nOne because he is an air traffic controller\n\nAnd two because you aren't waking up.  You are trying to learn to get up.", "So your routine matters but his need for sleep doesn\u2019t? Yes, YTA", "YTA. Part of being in a relationship and living together is being able to compromise. I see you keep telling him things he can do, such as sleeping on the couch, but you don't seem to be willing to make any changes. How is that even remotely fair?", "seriously? is there really a question here? the guy needs to sleep for work, very important and stressful work. i work with multiple offshore dev teams so i am up at all hours of the night and sleep when i can assuming i don't have morning meetings with the us based teams. my wife does everything thing she can to make sure i sleep well when i finally get to bed, and since she wakes up with the kids early in the morning i make sure i am as quiet as possible on late night conference calls and when i open or close doors at night. mutual respect is key in a relationship, you like that he works and contributes to the bottom line right? You respect the work he does keeping your friends and family safe in the air? What if he dropped the ball and didn't have the plane your running friends were on descend to the proper altitude to avoid another plane and there is a mid air collision? He didn't see the converging flight paths because he was tired. I suggest you pick the days you want to run, sleep on the couch if it conflicts with his sleep schedule, actually get up and run. Your basically saying to him, I don't care how you feel all day at work, I don't care about your health, and I certainly don't care about your job. I might need to run, possibly, maybe....", "YTA\n\nWhy is it OK to tell him to sleep on the couch when you could sleep on the couch as well? I assume neither of you wants to do that? He said no and you don\u2019t want to either? \n\nBut also, shift work is rough. Maybe boyfriend could sleep with earplugs in? I do this because my partner snores. If it\u2019s only for a couple of days so he\u2019s getting good rest for work, it\u2019s surely not that big of a deal?\n\nEdited to add: You\u2019re absolutely the asshole after all of your responses to this thread.\nSleep on the couch.

His wonky hours mean that he's going to be chronically sleep deprived.\n\nEdit: HOLY HELL HE'S AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER?!

If he says he can't get back to sleep after your alarm wakes him up, you could... just believe him! 5.5 hrs is not enough sleep, and if that's all he's able to get because of your loud alarm, that's a real, serious problem. My guess is that if a vibrating alarm doesn't wake you, you have no idea what it's like to be chronically underslept because you're a light sleeper living with a noisy partner/roommates/neighbors. It's MISERABLE. It's unhealthy, dangerous, and makes you feel just generally bad in your body all the time. Please have some compassion and consideration for this person you care about and just go sleep on the couch yourself if you're excited to get up early in the morning. Also, I get that cohabitation might be a financial necessity for you guys, but please consider getting separate bedrooms or even separate housing as soon as possible. I live separately from my partner of 7 years, and sleep is a huge factor. It helps a relationship stay strong and healthy when both partners have the space to get their basic needs met.", "YTA \n\nHe is an Air Traffic Controller.  Do you not see that he needs proper rest for his job?", "OP, you get a MASSIVE YTA from me!

Both of you have routines you wish to keep that are understandably frustrating the other. \n\nYou\u2019ve tried a vibrating alarm and it doesn\u2019t work. Has he tried sleeping with earbuds? Have you tried listening to a quieter alarm or found a gentler alarm tone? \n\nI don\u2019t think 6:30 AM is that early of an alarm, but I can see how it would be frustrating for him to only get 4-5 hours of sleep a night after those afternoon shifts. Have you considered just not running one or both of those nights? I know running is important to you, but your boyfriend will come to a point where sleep exhaustion is impacting his days and health.", "Edited to change vote to YTA now that I know he\u2019s an air traffic controller. In that case his sleep is critical even if they have him working irregular shifts. \n\n[Old vote was N T A]. He needs to move out and get a place of his own or you guys get a 2BR place until he gets a different job. His work schedule is the most unhealthy one I\u2019ve heard of. The human body is not designed to work 2 days mornings, 2 days afternoons, and 2 days overnights all in the same week.  He will live in a constant state of jet lag trying to adjust to day sleeping and night sleeping and back again.  The core problem is a job problem. You should keep your routine and he should sleep elsewhere on those days.", "NAH but going for a run isn\u2019t really mandatory as getting to work is. So for 2 days a week, what\u2019s the harm if you missed the run? Do you not wake up at all once you have a routine going?", "NAH.  Sometimes sleeping in different rooms can save a relationship if you have the space", "NAH - just a crappy situation. I know you said you tried a vibrating alarm...maybe one of those ones that goes under your pillow?", "I started as N T A but I have to say NAH\n\nI worked nights for a long time and it sucks. I also worked rotating shifts at a hotel -- that sucked more. But as someone else said, this is part of living together. And there's a huge difference between preventing someone from sleeping (continued noise/alarms) and just one alarm going off. \n\nThat said, sleep deprivation is used as torture for a reason. I was a raging b\\*tch when I worked these jobs because I wasn't sleeping enough. I lost friendships because people didn't understand what it was like to just... not sleep. It makes it really hard to function. And, unfortunately, work takes precedence over a workout -- he can't choose to skip work without major consequences, or at least consequences that are bigger than you missing or rescheduling a run. (I say this with sympathy as someone who needs to workout for the good brain chemicals.) So I think offering to sleep on the couch those nights would be a good move.", "NAH - both of you value you\u2019re schedules and this is just one of those things that have to be worked out with two people. \n\nMy husband wakes up for work at 2:30am and likes to set an alarm for 5am on his days off. I usually wake up around 9am. I got used to my husbands alarm and now sleep through it (on the rare event it does wake me up and he turns it off and stays in bed I\u2019ll get a bit prickly because if he doesn\u2019t get up the next alarm will go off. So I kick him out of bed). He\u2019s a lighter sleeper than me but also falls asleep easier so if I get a call in the middle of the night (I\u2019m on call for some emergencies) it wakes him up, he wakes me up, and I answer. \n\nLong story short - no one wants woken up by someone else\u2019s alarm and no one wants to not be able to have an alarm and how you guys work it out is totally up to you. My husband started using gentler sounding alarms for non-work days to lower the chance they wake me. Otherwise, we just got used to it", "NAH\u2014 your BF is not used to your alarm and it\u2019s making it hard for him to sleep. You need the alarm to get up.\n\nMy husband and I went through this when we first moved in together. I am the one who couldn\u2019t fall back asleep after his alarm. Now that we have been together for six years, I am used to it and can get back to sleep easily. \n\nYour BF likely just needs a bit longer to get used to it. It can be tough, but people who need alarms to wake up at a specific time really aren\u2019t going to magically start waking up without an alarm so the other person just has to suck it up and deal until they get used to the sound.\n\nYou could try a light alarm (one that brightens the room) or a different type of sound\u2014 we settled on nature sounds that start quietly and get louder over about three minutes so my husband often hears it and turns it off before I wake up. \n\nI know it\u2019s not easy for him right now but he will get used to the alarm. \n\nCould you sleep on the couch those nights? Or trade off\u2014 he might be more amenable to it if you do the couch one night and he does the other. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA.  I work rotating swing shifts and I get where he's coming from (when your sleeping schedule changes all the time, it *can* be hard to get back to sleep if you wake up) but that doesn't mean his schedule should trump yours.

It's just something you'll need to figure out between you, but him wanting it all his way isn't reasonable because you have needs too.\n\nEdit: After reading some of you comments I'm going to point out that wanting it all *your* way isn't reasonable either because he has needs too.", "Nta.
