Also, pro tip for our guy here: You never talk bad things loudly, even on your native language in a different country, because you never know who might be listening and understanding. I learned that when I was in Vienna\ud83d\ude02 Although I never said anything bad so I didn't mind and actually thought it was hilarious, too bad he can't say the same", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

So great he learned those! Maybe the upside is he has multiple Alphabets and different languages so he does not mix them up. I speak English, German, French and Dutch.

It\u2019s clearly the intention.", "Oh I know right?! It was in my top two motivations for taking it in the first place!", "I'm sick of these posts where people act like idiots but are offended because someone noticed, especially since many of them have racist/xenophobic connotations, NTA and the reasoning is ridiculous, no one says \"Hi my name is x and I speak English y Spanish\"; and throw away that friend, anyone who makes you for a guy you just met is not worth it, you already realized how much he supports you", "I\u2019m Dutch speaking but I understand French since that is also a language spoken in my country. I never let people know this fact unless I\u2019m being asked. I\u2019ve heard so\nmuch shit being talked when I was around, simply because they thought I didn\u2019t understand it. That\u2019s on them.\n\nYou are not obligated to disclose this, so NTA. You also did the right thing as a friend, but I\u2019ve learned this a long time ago: they always shoot the messenger. It\u2019s a tricky situation so don\u2019t blame yourself. And maybe find a better friend, she doesn\u2019t sound fun.", "Lmao... The BS is strong with that one. \n\nSince when does anybody have to announce what languages they speak?\nWill it be mandatory to print out curriculum vitae for those occasions?\n\nSo he thought that he would be safe trash talking your friend in Spanish. But YOU'RE the a-hole?!\n\nYour friend is an ahole for not trusting you\nAnd he and his assfriend are the assiestest of all. \n\nBut you, my dear are definitely NTA", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  You do not owe anyone a list of the languages you know when you meet them.  There is a particular arrogance of someone who believes that because they are the only person from a particular country in a group, they will be the only person who knows that language.  Spanish is spoken in many places.  He can't own the rights.  As to your friend- she believes what she wants to, but you still did her a favor.  At some point she will discover what a jerk he is.", "NTA. You are a good friend! Do not care about Adrian, he is just upset he got caught saying nasty stuff. \n\nHe should learn both to not say nasty stuff about women, and also not assume people don\u2019t speak Spanish. Ffs, they were a colonial country, their language is spread all around the world.", "NTA and neither of those people seem worth your time.", "NTA. I\u2019d like to apologize. I evidently lost my cool with my previous response. Thank you mods.   \n\n\nFriends are supposed to be there for each other. I would have felt really reassured if you let me know someone was badmouthing me.   \n\n\nGood news. She has removed herself from you life. Continue the way you are. You\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll surround yourself by quality people and that matters. I hope she changes because I wish no one ill will, but she has truly failed you as a friend.   \n\n\nHad you been in her shoes she\u2019d have let it go on. Trust me you should feel betrayed if your friend didn\u2019t step in for that.   \n\n\nBest of luck! Keep being a good friend. Someone will appreciate it!", "You need better people in your life \ud83d\ude36", "NTA but wtf. The way he freaked out on you should\u2019ve been proof to her that he did what you accused him of. He could\u2019ve played it off and stayed calm and say you must\u2019ve misunderstood or anything other than getting this hostile and acting guilty. \n\nYou\u2019re a good friend for looking out for your girl. Hopefully she\u2019ll realize the truth soon enough", "Uhhh, so he\u2019s mad that you understand he\u2019s a shit stain.. and your friend thinks, what.. that you made it up and he said nothing wrong?  Or that you don\u2019t actually speak the language and misunderstood?  The only reason for this guy to be mad is because you were right about what you heard, and absolutely right you should tell your friend.. she just absolutely failed you in her reaction.\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nAdrian's point is that he should know if it's ok to talk shit in Spanish right away? *\"I had no business speaking it anyway?\"*  Really. \n\nYour friend will eventually grasp that you tried to give her a warning.", "That's no friend.\nGeeze, what happed to girl code \nShe should be done with him and be grateful to friend.\nCrazy.\nNot the asshole.", "NTA are we announcing languages we speak when we meet people now?", "NTA the silver lining is you get to be rid of 2 TA in your life", "NTA but you should have known this could happen.

Is with a guy who talks poop about her in Spanish. But complains online that you should have said you speak Spanish and that you shouldnt even speak Spanish? Lol.", "so he is mad because you should have revealed that you spoke spanish in the first place .... looks like he admitted to saying bad shit about her by calling you out", "NTA - good luck to your ex-friend. She\u2019s going to need it.", "NTA. You had your friend's interest at heart and she can obviously choose to believe you or not. My guess is she'll find out the truth sooner or later.", "I live in NYC. I told my daughter that if she stands in Times Square for 24 hours, there is a chance she might hear every single language spoken by humans at this time. Swahili, Urdu, Hebrew, Maori, Gaelic - at any given time. If I know any of these languages, I am not 'hiding' it, and if I hear important info, you best bet that I will pass it on when possible.. Maybe you should ask your friend why she didn't tell him you spoke Spanish, maybe she was 'hiding' that fact from him.\n\nSounds to me like your friend is so insecure or inexperienced that she fears losing this loser. He sounds like garbage, and didn't like being found out so soon. I would comment on his posts about why he said what he said, take a screenshot, send it to your friend, and be done with both of them. When it all fails, she will have no one to blame but herself, and not you.", "NTA. You are seriously asking?\n\nBest part of learning languages is not telling people you know it. The amount of enjoyment I've gotten by people thinking I'm just another clueless white person in Hong Kong", "NTA. Go LC with your friend. In time when she finally realizes what a drip this guy is, she will admit she was wrong.  Until then she's obsessively infatuated with him. Even if you videoed it, she'd acuse you of somehow editing it. I feel sorry for her.", "NTA.  The old saying \"Don't kill the messenger\" was something your friend ignored.  I suspect she will eventually be contacting you to tell you how horrible the boyfriend treated her.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Some people will respond by shooting the messenger.", "NTA, your \u201cfriend\u201d will learn the hard way eventually and realize she should have listened to you..and her comment about you have no business speaking \u201cit\u201d anyway is beyond ignorant.

You did the right thing. If she wants to ignore it her loss. You have been spared from the misery of those two.

He harasses her online??\n\nLmao that girl really has some blinders on.", "This! \n\nThe rose color glasses are strong with this friend since she didn\u2019t even see this. How could OP be lying about what was said if the BF was pissed she spoke Spanish?!  Hopefully the friend sees his true colors and she\u2019ll have to hope that OP will still be there for her. \n\nNTA", "But no, you see, you speak AmErIcAn Spanish, and he speaks SpAiN-Spanish, so the meanings are reversed. /s", "I've studied Spanish, Russian, Persian and French.  And I've traveled a lot.  I've run into Persian speakers in Moscow, Russian speakers in Phuket (where I also found native speakers of Finnish), and Spanish speakers in Latvia.  I know native speakers of Danish who have overheard Danish convos in Syria, and speakers of Afrikaans who have overheard Afrikaans convos in Guatemala.\n\nCompared to Spanish, the overheard languages in all these examples are rare.  So agreed: anyone who thinks they can privately talk shit in Spanish anywhere in the world is a moron.\n\nYes, there are a very few languages that for all practical purposes are \"secret.\"  But you'd be very foolish to operate on the assumption that you are having an absolutely private conversation if you're speaking ANY language in public.", "I bet he would still find ways to complain about OP.\n\n\"What do you actually expect me to read it? If there was something important in there you should have told me\" \n\nor something like that", "I mean, less common, sure, but not so rare I'd assume no-one else at a party spoke any! \n\nHalf my year group did Spanish instead of French at school, my niblings are bilingual, and Spain is much closer to us than Mexico is to most US states!", "The people who live on North Sentinel Island are so isolated from (and hostile to) outsiders no one else even knows anything about their language.

Do you have a link perchance?", "Lol my sister has counted to ten for me in Spanish before (she did Spanish in school), and I don't remember the numbers, but I remember a lot of them were similar to French!
