BF is angrily bitching about you speaking Spanish AND denying that he said what he said AND your \"friend\" believes him over you?  Your friend is pretty damn gullible.  \n\nOP, you're NTA.  If BF didn't want anyone knowing what he said, he shouldn't have said it.  \n\nDon't feel bad if you lose a friend over this.  You told the truth and did nothing wrong.  You don't need friends who are credulous to the point of stupidity.  \n\nBF is pretty damn stupid too.  There basically are NO secret languages out there.  Whatever language you speak, you're going to randomly run into someone in a place you don't expect, who will speak it.  And Spanish is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world.", "NTA.\nYour responsibility is to your friend - you did the right thing. \n\nYou also don't need to lead a conversation with a full breakdown of the languages you speak. Adrian's false umbridge should be a red flag here. It's not on you if your friend refuses to see it.", "NTA\n\nHe's just upset that he got caught. Nobody starts an introduction by announcing what other languages you speak. You were just trying to help her, he seems like an awful person and hopefully she will realize it soon.", "NTA. Your friend shot the messenger. It's unfortunately not that surprising, but I think you did the only thing you could do. You acted in good faith; it's not your fault your friend is blinded by the D.\n\nEventually she'll figure it out. What you do at that point--whether you decide to continue the friendship or not--is up to you.", "NTA.\n\nIf he said something nasty about his girlfriend, he DESERVES what he got. And most importantly, she deserves to know.\n\nAnd no one can blame you for anything. You speak Spanish, that\u2019s no one\u2019s business.\n\nAnd if he wanted to hide his nastiness like a coward, he might as well could\u2018ve shut the fuck up!", "NTA.  There's a reason the saying is \"no good deed goes unpunished.\"", "NTA. She is mad at a wrong person. It\u2019s funny that \u2018you had no business speaking it anyway\u2019 lol.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong here. Your friend is an asshole for not believing you, especially if you\u2019ve never given her a reason to doubt your sincerity. \n\nAlso, Adrian is mad because he knows you\u2019re telling the truth. If you\u2019d heard him saying nice things and reported it back, he would not be upset at all. It\u2019s faux outrage and he\u2019s doing it to distract his girlfriend from the truth.", "You could confront him privately and record him admitting that, but honestly, whats the point.\n\nFrom where i stand the only thing you lost is your time and energy, for someone not worth it. They deserve each other. \n\n\nNta", "Hard NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re a good friend and a true girl\u2019s girl. You owe absolutely nothing to Adrian. Or anyone for that matter. He is not entitled to explanations or any personal information about you, including how many languages you speak. The only reason he\u2019s throwing a hissy fit is because he got caught. He\u2019s clearly a nasty toxic manipulator and your friend is seemingly not only oblivious to that, but she\u2019s also wildly ungrateful and nasty herself. \n\nReconsider this friendship because while you were sticking your back out for her, she was ready to stick a knife into your back. She watched as he called you out of your name and didn\u2019t hesitate to leave you to fend for yourself before harassing you online. Anyone who doesn\u2019t appreciate what you did doesn\u2019t deserve your friendship.", "You're NTA.\n\nThe UK is pretty international. I always assume whatever language is being spoken there's someone in the group who speaks it but hasn't let on.", "NTA. Whatever language you overheard him in, if he\u2019s talking shit about your friend you would want her to know. It\u2019s a shame she believes him but I think you did the right thing OP", "NTA - You don't owe anybody information on what languages you speak, and certainly not to go \"Oh by the way I speak Spanish so avoid speaking shit about my friend, kthxbye :)\".\n\nTried to do right by your friend, and it's a shame she's not believing you. I do have to wonder why that is though - Are you not close friends?\n\nEdit: Chuckling to myself now picturing you handing a comprehensive CV to every new person you meet from now on \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. You're not obligated to disclose your languages the first time you meet someone, that's not \"hiding\" it. Adrian shouldn't have assumed nobody else spoke Spanish and he DEFINITELY shouldn't be saying horrible things about his own girlfriend. That being said, your friend is also an AH. You rightfully tried to point out a red flag about her new boyfriend and she didn't believe you over him? I know love can be blind but damn, she really shut her own friend down over a boy. Guess girl code is out the window here. It's also a red flag that he's trashing you online, but I guess she won't care about that either. I bet it'll be so hard to not say \"I told you so\" when he inevitably breaks her heart and she comes crying back to you.", "NTA\n\nYour friend has to be super blind because he literally admitted to you knowing Spanish while simultaneously denying you told her truth about what he said? He sounds really stupid and when the fog lifts, I hope she sees his hypocrisy", "NTA\n\nTalking crap about somebody behind their back, especially your own gf, is awful thing to do. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was in a common tongue or not. Maybe he just needs to learn this lesson and have more respect for his gfs?", "NTA. As a multilingual person, when I speak one of my other languages in public, I understand that I\u2019m always running the risk of others understanding me. This guy took a risk and it backfired. \n\nAlso, why would you immediately disclose other languages you speak to everyone you meet. If it comes naturally, sure but it\u2019s weird if you always start conversations with new people with \u201cHi my name is Jane and I speak the following language.\u201d", "NTA\nYou did the right thing. Hopefully your friend comes to her senses soon.", "NTA its great opportunity to be able to exercise an advantage like that. Adrian is clearly an asshole. Decides to double down on being an adshole to protect his own ass. Your friend is in denial.", "NTA. Adrian is an idiot to think that Spanish speakers are so rare that no one would hear him loudly badmouthing someone else. He has only himself to blame", "NTA \n\nI'm sorry your friend abandoned you for sticking up for her.", "NTA, you did right by your friend. Too bad she believed her trash bf over you.", "NTA\n\nYour conscience is clear (or it should be). You stood by your friend even though she didn't appreciate it. Hopefully she'll realise that Adrian is an AH but that's on her.", "NTA. Who's gonna meet someone and say \"hi I'm bozo and I speak 3 languages, so be careful what I might overhear.\" Your friend will figure it out by herself.", "NTA, but now you know she\u2019s not really your friend. Best to distance yourself from self-destructive people like that.", "NTA. No matter what language you are speaking, if it's out loud people can hear you and some of them may understand. Did they think they were speaking in secret code?\n\nYour friend is in a bad relationship and you did your best to warn her. She'll find out eventually. \n\nIf anyone mentions this to you, just point out that if you had made that all up, they would be mad at you for lying, not for speaking Spanish without a warning sticker.", "NTA. You're a good friend.", "NTA, people don't introduce themselves and list the languages they know. He's just pissed he got caught", "NTA. You can learn all the languagues you want and he can sut Up and dont say nasty thinks about nobody in any language if he dont wanna that person knows. \nNTA for speak spanish (Im from Spain and I dont care Who knows to speak It or not), you don't hide the fact that you speak It, you only dont Talk to him enought to Tell him this in a conversation, and you are not NTA for Tell your  friend the truth. \nSoon or later, she is gonna see the light and how owfull he is, but in all these situation, you are the only person Who its not an A.", "Nta. If they have something confidential to say, say it quietly, or behind closed doors, or don't say it at all.\n\nNot even sure why would talk crap about his gf ? Trying to look , sound big in front of his friend by degrading his gf? Your friend is putting her head in the sand. Let them destroy each other. You've done your outreach and don't owe them anymore scenes in the soap opera", "Uh not the asshole sounds like Adrian is furious he can't talk shit about the gringos and panchitas like he wants to", "Your friends the AH, not you. But also\u2026this is like the plot of every teen movie. There\u2019s really not much you can do to prove to her you were telling the truth. You have to wait for Adrian to prove it to her himself. And unfortunately, it\u2019s not easy to watch a friend get hurt. \n\nJust don\u2019t say \u201cI told you so\u201d when he proves you were right.", "I think you did everything right accept advising Adrian to keep his voice down to prevent him being overheard...Can you guess why?", "NTA. you did the right thing. your friend deserve to know what her boyfriend really thinks about her. maybe it would help if you recorded that conversation. but of your friend choose to believe him then what else you can do. \nand you dont have to say hello my name is juana and i speak spanish italian chinesse japanesse etc etc to every person you meet. lmao", "NTA.  No obligation to disclose all skill sets upon meeting someone.  Dumbasses get caught with egg in their face.  You did nothing wrong.", "Lol definitely NTA. Darvo.", "NTA and sorry your friend didn't believe you (her loss). But really, who can look at his reaction and still believe you weren't telling the truth? If he's still angry that you didn't reveal that you could speak Spanish, doesn't this mean that there was in fact something he didn't want you overhearing?\n\nOnly thing I can think of is chewing him out in English in the moment and very loudly when you heard him talking to his friend. Get a lot of attention (draw others from the party to see what's going on) and repeat bits of what he was saying in Spanish and English as you yell at him.
