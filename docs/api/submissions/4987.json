Keep moving forward.", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing in trying to warn your friend.\n\nIf she wants to stay with an AH, that's her AH choice.", "Okay do people actually go on telling which languages they know of when they are introduced to one another? Lol. Plus you were not spying..you just heard them speak loudly at that. If they didn't want anyone hearing what they were saying then they should not have spoken those nasty words. The problem was not in what they were speaking but that you understood them? Silly thing to assume only you understand your language huh. What i don't understand however is why your friend kicked you out! You were just looking after her and got punished for that? I guess they deserve each other. \nOP you are NTA in my opinion.", "NTA. Run away from your friend and her nasty boyfriend.  Your friend chose her bf side n did not trust you. The Spanish boyfriend sounds like a dick. So just save yourself  a headache  from that mess", "\"Hi,  I'm so-and-so, my pronouns are they/them, and I speak English, Spanish, intermediate German, and whatever  Chineese I could absorb from Ni Hao, Kai-Lan. I know a few words from Pingu too; It's nice to meet you\" - A direct quote from NO ONE EVER.\n\nYou're NTA, although I do wonder what was actually being said. \n\nYour,  \"Friends\" are not your friends.  Go find humans to be your friends,  and avoid pieces of $**7  like these in the future. These things are what we refer to as idiots, and AH... These AHs are not the kind of AH you're looking for. You're 100% NTA.", "Seriously, friend is not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed here.", "I live in an area where Spanish is common enough that I'm never surprised that a random person speaks it. I also can't imagine being upset someone else learned your language. That's absurd.", "I speak 4 languages and I never tell anyone when introducing myself\u2026 why should I? I mean I see how that one would go. \u201cHi, I am Polly and I speak 4 languages.\u201d \u2026 \u201cShowoff\u201d", "He\u2019s not losing a friend if this \u2018friend\u2019 is taking the side of someone just join the group and talking some of the maddest shit he can cause he thinks he can get away with it.\n\nOP is NTA and probably about to be better off if the \u2018friend\u2019 doesn\u2019t figure out they picked the wrong side to be on", "Okay, I know this is serious and OP is definitely NTA and I am upset the friend believes someone she just started dating over OP.\n\nBut my childish a** self is really upset about your very correct statement here. \n\n>There basically are NO secret languages out there\n\nBRB I'm off to go invent a secret language because I really want one to exist", "This. NTA. But, OP, lots of people do this, unfortunately. They don't want to know the truth. Your conscience is clear. Eventually, she'll either see who he is and apologize, or she'll marry the guy and have an awful life. She can't say no one warned her though.", "It\u2019s a real head scratcher why Adrian is mad at you for not telling him you speak Spanish if you didn\u2019t accurately translate the awful things he said about your friend.  It\u2019s also a mystery why your friend chose to believe Adrian\u2019s lies denying he said those shitty things about her.  \n\nYou did the right thing.  Adrian and your friend are assholes.  NTA.", "ZERO secret languages. My husband speaks Hungarian and what\u2019s the first damn language we hear at the Blue Lagoon in Iceland? A bunch of Hungarians bitching about it.", "I suppose the languages of some uncontacted peoples might effectively be secret languages, but we won't find them attending parties in the UK!", "She's making up what I said in Spanish, but also how dare she not tell me she spoke Spanish are two conflicting thoughts, and friend is quite gullible if she buys that.", "Nobody starts an introduction by announcing what other languages you speak.", "Spanish is less commonly spoken in the UK than it is in America. People are generally more likely to know French! (Our closest neighbour is France - yours is Mexico). That said, Spanish is still one of the most common foreign languages known here, along with German.\n\nI personally know literally zero Spanish. I couldn't even count to ten, lol.", "And don't forget to mention any plastic surgery you've had (that was from a post last week!)", "\"Hello, nice to meet you! I know I'm speaking in English right now but I also speak Spanish, FYI, you know, just in case you were going to talk shit in Spanish...\"\n\nYou mean you DON'T introduce yourself that way??
