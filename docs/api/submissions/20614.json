You basically pick what you like from bins into a bag and they weight it at the register and you pay. I do have a sweet tooth however, so as to not get carried away I picked out some specific things I would like and paid for them. It was around $20. The day I got back , X asked me if I had gone to the store with the Dr Pepper flavored jelly beans (he knows about the store). I said I had but I didn\u2019t get the Dr Pepper ones, but I did get other flavors. I offered him my bag and said \u201chey try some of them, they\u2019re good\u201d. He takes a handful and says they\u2019re great, I set the bag down on the kitchen counter and walk away. X continues to get increasingly high with his friend. \n\n5 hours later I want to try some of the things I got, so I went to the kitchen but the bag wasn\u2019t there. I look around and it\u2019s on the coffee table with X passed out on the couch which is kinda weird bc I didn\u2019t leave it there. I go to grab my bag and I see it\u2019s 90% empty. I also happen to startle X awake and he\u2019s like \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d . I ask him if he ate all the candy and we go back and forth for five minutes as he acts like he doesn\u2019t know what I mean. Finally I point to my bag, point to him and shake it. He then says \u201cI have money I can replace it.\u201d I ask if he\u2019s going to Vegas soon and he says no but he has money. I say \u201cthis is not cool at all man\u201d and walk away. \n\nTo be honest if he had just apologized I wouldn\u2019t be that mad but everytime weed is involved he does something to upset someone and never owns up to it. Not even a \u201cmy bad\u201d. Sometimes he rsvps to events and doesn\u2019t show up bc he got too high. Sometimes he will lock my cat in the linen closet for hours because my cat ran in there while my roomie was looking for something and he forgets to bring the cat out even thought he saw it run in. Sometimes he leaves the front door partly open late at night.And on top of it his attitude today when I asked was not to my liking at all. So I am thinking of asking him to stop using my gaming console and other things I keep in the living room because he can\u2019t respect other peoples belongings. \n\nWhy I think I may be the AH- a total ban on using my devices might be an overkill especially since it\u2019s over something small like candy. It seems really dumb to care this much over $20, maybe I need to find a different hill to die on.\n\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nEdit: hey y\u2019all, thanks a lot for all the comments, as cliche as it sounds I really didn\u2019t think there would be so many of you here! A lot of you have told me that the underlying issue is his behavior in general. Yes I totally agree, and there have been many conversations around his weed habits already. It\u2019s difficult to bring up because he gets extremely defensive about it. However, what has worked somewhat so far is to bring up specific instances of his behavior and ask him to not do it. So it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t stand up for myself, I do and I\u2019ve had many talks with him. That\u2019s why I think linking the candy situation to moving my things/banning him will send a clear message. \n\nRe: the cat- yeah, that is 100% not okay. He has cats of his own too and they are also somewhat neglected. I am also going to move out but I\u2019m locked in for at least half a year because of lease terms. I\u2019m a student and I can\u2019t break a lease like this because it gets expensive but believe me when the cat thing happened I was really mad.
