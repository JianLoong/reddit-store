Second year living together and X is a part of my extended friend group and hence a reason for moving in with him - he came somewhat vetted and it was better than living with strangers. \n\nThe issue at hand - I recently got back from a trip to Las Vegas where I went to this big candy store that sells candy by the pound. You basically pick what you like from bins into a bag and they weight it at the register and you pay. I do have a sweet tooth however, so as to not get carried away I picked out some specific things I would like and paid for them. It was around $20. The day I got back , X asked me if I had gone to the store with the Dr Pepper flavored jelly beans (he knows about the store). I said I had but I didn\u2019t get the Dr Pepper ones, but I did get other flavors. I offered him my bag and said \u201chey try some of them, they\u2019re good\u201d. He takes a handful and says they\u2019re great, I set the bag down on the kitchen counter and walk away. X continues to get increasingly high with his friend. \n\n5 hours later I want to try some of the things I got, so I went to the kitchen but the bag wasn\u2019t there. I look around and it\u2019s on the coffee table with X passed out on the couch which is kinda weird bc I didn\u2019t leave it there. I go to grab my bag and I see it\u2019s 90% empty. I also happen to startle X awake and he\u2019s like \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d . I ask him if he ate all the candy and we go back and forth for five minutes as he acts like he doesn\u2019t know what I mean. Finally I point to my bag, point to him and shake it. He then says \u201cI have money I can replace it.\u201d I ask if he\u2019s going to Vegas soon and he says no but he has money. I say \u201cthis is not cool at all man\u201d and walk away. \n\nTo be honest if he had just apologized I wouldn\u2019t be that mad but everytime weed is involved he does something to upset someone and never owns up to it. Not even a \u201cmy bad\u201d. Sometimes he rsvps to events and doesn\u2019t show up bc he got too high. Sometimes he will lock my cat in the linen closet for hours because my cat ran in there while my roomie was looking for something and he forgets to bring the cat out even thought he saw it run in. Sometimes he leaves the front door partly open late at night.And on top of it his attitude today when I asked was not to my liking at all. So I am thinking of asking him to stop using my gaming console and other things I keep in the living room because he can\u2019t respect other peoples belongings. \n\nWhy I think I may be the AH- a total ban on using my devices might be an overkill especially since it\u2019s over something small like candy. It seems really dumb to care this much over $20, maybe I need to find a different hill to die on.\n\n\nThank you for reading!", "created_utc": 1687757268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14j86ti/wibta_if_i_told_my_roommate_he_is_not_welcome_to/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "NTA because he's acting like a child and that would be horrible to live with. However, I don't think a ban on using devices is really going to accomplish much. You'd be better off finding a new living situation. I would not be okay with someone locking my cat in a linen closet for hours.", "If this was over *candy*, I would maybe be tempted to say soft Y-T-A or E-S-H, but girl, he straight up *endangers your cat*, you\u2019d be the asshole if you keep putting your cat in danger.\n\nNTA, but I think that you *need* to have a sit down with him and have a serious conversation about his habits or how he acts when he\u2019s high. Things like bailing because he\u2019s high is kinda his own business, but trapping your cat (even if unintentionally) is fucked. If he can\u2019t act like an adult while he\u2019s high, then he probably shouldn\u2019t be getting high in first place and you should have firm boundaries in regards to your cat and house.", "NTA. It's not just $20, it's $20 plus airfare, ground transportation, and hotel. I would move your stuff to your room and look at moving out when your lease is up.", "NTA but I would leave my stuff in my room. Especially, if he leaves the door open.", "NTA. it\u2019s your things and your belongings so you def have the right to ban him. however, i do think banning from everything is a bit of an overkill. maybe try talking to him when he is sober and see if the response is better. i suggest setting  some firm(er) boundaries., not just with your belongings either.", "NTA\n\nNot at all. I don't let anyone other than myself use my devices anyway. I paid for 'em, and you can get your own. Roommates means sharing a place, not sharing everything. So I don't think it's an AH move at all to put a ban on using your stuff. It's clear that he has no respect for anything, including himself. Sounds like you need to find a new place and a new roommate as soon as possible and let him figure out what to do with the place you shared. \n\nLocking your cat in a closet is crazy too. I'd move out immediately if that happened. He sounds like the kind of person to take a nap on your bed because he's worried he might throw up in his. Get outta there, girl!", "ESH  You aren't even being honest with him. these gripes have nothing to do with a game. Talk to him about being irresponsible when he's high!  With the cat and front door etc... You have bigger problems than your toys.", "ESH\n\nIt does not seem like it is about the candy but more about the pattern of behavior when he is high.\n\nHave you mentioned that to him specifically? Or do you just mention each individual thing like the cat and the candy?", "While common sense dictates not to finish everything, unless you stated they couldn't eat it or whatever, just leaving it there is an invitation to eat it. So yes, YWBTA. If you don't want him using your things, keep them in your room. If you don't like his habits in general (understandably so - we also shared a space with people who would forget to lock the doors and it's scary), end the roommate agreement.", "NTA but you are a baby. Your roommate is a baby also. You came to reddit about someone eating your candy, seriously?", "You would be the asshole. You didn\u2019t tell him not to eat more candy. The man was high as balls. He probably just got hungry so he ate candies. He even offers to pay to replace them. Like cmon man get over it and stop being so weird", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he's regularly leaving the door open all night and locking your cat places, then the latter is the better option\n\nSometimes living with someone you know is worse than a random person bc they kinda relax into not filtering their bad habits cause you \"know\" each other", "Well, you can tell him but he'll probably claim he \"forgot\" while he was high. Just put your stuff where he can't access it anymore. NTA", "Took the words right out of my mouth. Irresponsible and disrespectful of others, you want to smoke then do so but not at others expense.", "Yeah that\u2019s kind of where my mind went with the candy. It\u2019s not just something you can go replace at your local Walmart. I would think it the same as someone drinking my wines that I get traveling that I can\u2019t find locally.", "Hey thanks for the comment! I can definitely see your perspective here and will have another conversation with him. I just wanted to say that I have already had a talk about the cat and front door and that behavior has not been rectified yet. \n\nI understand I have to look for a new living situation, but that cannot happen for a bit because of the lease terms. Thanks again for the comment", "Hi, you are correct that it\u2019s about the pattern of behavior. His weed habits are difficult to discuss because I have tried and he gets extremely defensive. So then I bring up specific instances and ask him to please not do it. That has a better success rate overall. \n\nAlthough for the cat thing, I didn\u2019t see much of a change as it happened recently again.", "Paying to replace them does nothing unless he wants to actually travel to vegas and get them. Offering someone a few candies doesn\u2019t give you free reign to eat them all. Contrary to popular belief you can still control yourself when high (and if you can\u2019t- don\u2019t get high!)", "NTA\n\nFWIW I would say something like, \"I have noticed that when you get high, you aren't considerate of others. For example... Cat, candy, etc\n\nBecause of that, I don't want you using my, switch, etc.\"\n\nWhen you are giving example of his behaviors just focus on the things that affect you personally. For example, I wouldn't bring up him flaking out on going to parties. Unless it was your party that he flaked out on.\n\nGood luck.", "Technically didn\u2019t finish it all. Also I could understand being upset at the moment but like how childish so you have to be to still be upset days later. Upset enough to start making rules about random things. It\u2019s just candy and the person offered to replace it", "This happened a few hours ago, if that adds context.", "You should start keeping your stuff in your room", "NTA OP.  I would find a new roommate if I were you.", "If you\u2019re not happy just move out", "You have listed at least 5 good reasons not to live with this guy. He steals, he\u2019s unreliable, he never takes responsibility, he mistreats your cat, and he has repeatedly put your personal safety at risk. Why are you questioning your judgement? He sound like a spaced out nightmare. Any of those reasons are a hill to die on. NTA", "Even though there is a fight over candy, there is a real issue. Taking someone\u2019s items without permission and giving an unsatisfactory repayment is just wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Leave the dock outside and keep the device in your room. If he asks why/ to use it list everything you just said.", "Potentially both tbh. My second thought (behind the home invasion) was that the door would be open and the cat would get out or smth. It's dangerous leaving doors open with pets that freeroam. NTA, btw.", "Man, it's not even life and death. How could he come to a serious place like reddit with such a trivial issue. There are people out here dying in comment sections", "To be fair, I've been able to get virtually any candy in bulk via Amazon and other online purveyors. So the candy likely can be replaced without flying out to Vegas again. But that doesn't excuse the behavior. The roommate is endangering the cat, OP, and himself with his reckless and selfish behavior overall. He needs to go. After he pays for the replacement candy to be overnighted to OP, of course."]}
