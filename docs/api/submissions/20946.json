It was very nice of you to support your step-mom for the past year, but it also should never have been your responsibility to do so. Move out and never come back.

Grieving is NOT an excuse for the shit she has pulled and it's time to be done with it.  Your mental health was exacerbated by the robbery I'm sure but let's take a look at this from another perspective.  This woman tries to claim the title of family.  Well then she should treat you BETTER then you would expect a stranger to, and if she doesn't why give her more leeway then you would a stranger.  If a brand new acquaintance accused you of stealing would you stay in contact or would you be done with them?  If they offered you to stay with them and then kicked you out, then bitched about you leaving would you bother keeping in touch?  If not, why should your stepmom, who should be treating you BETTER then this hypothetical acquaintance, get more leeway?  Drop contact let her solve her own problems for a while and if she apologizes for being awful consider letting her back into your life.  However considering she WANTS you to suffer, as there is no other explanation for demanding you go back to work, seeing as PTO is PAID TIME OFF it isn't about the money the only other explanation I can come up with is she just doesn't like that you're taking care of yourself do you really want someone who wants you to be miserable because she is in your life?", "This woman is a user and a mental abuser. Do not in any shape or form feel any sort of guilt for removing yourself from a hostile environment. She\u2019s a grownup and it\u2019s not your job to take care of her. You were also devastated by the loss of your father and in no way has she tried to help you with your pain. Instead she took advantage of your helpful nature. Discard this person. Some people really aren\u2019t worth it.", "NTA- she is mad and trying to manipulate you into staying by making you feel guilty for leaving and \u201cputting her in a bad spot\u201d. She is the reason she is in the spot she is, not you. It is her house and bills, not yours and used you to pay her way to live and keep a roof over her head.
