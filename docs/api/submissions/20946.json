Are you sure they were robberies or did she do it?", "NTA\n\nShe threatened to kick you out. You called her bluff. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re out of that situation. I hope your new home is nearer to work.\n\nSorry for your loss, OP.", "NTA and you really need to block every potential form of contact and not tell anyone she knows where you're moving because she can and will harass you endlessly by phone, internet, 3rd party, and in person.", "I am sorry for your loss. It was very nice of you to support your step-mom for the past year, but it also should never have been your responsibility to do so. Move out and never come back. Don't let her guilt you into thinking that you put her in a bad spot - that is all on her. She's an adult, hopefully you are too.. Either way, move out, don't look back, and I wish you the best.

You are not her husband and don't have any responsibility for her, she sounds like she's made your life very difficult.  I hope you find your new life without her much better.", "NTA cut off contact, she\u2019s just gonna try to contact you to manipulate you into giving her money. Also how and why the hell did she allow the house to get robbed twice????", "NTA - good job of moving out already, and if I were you I\u2019d go Nc/lc, she doesn\u2019t sound good for your mental health.", "NTA.\n\n It isn't your responsibility to provide for her and make sure she has a rainy-day fund. Unless there's a reason she physically cannot work, but in that case there are usually government assist programs for situations like that.", "NTA, go NC with this insanely toxic person.  Grieving is NOT an excuse for the shit she has pulled and it's time to be done with it.  Your mental health was exacerbated by the robbery I'm sure but let's take a look at this from another perspective.  This woman tries to claim the title of family.  Well then she should treat you BETTER then you would expect a stranger to, and if she doesn't why give her more leeway then you would a stranger.  If a brand new acquaintance accused you of stealing would you stay in contact or would you be done with them?  If they offered you to stay with them and then kicked you out, then bitched about you leaving would you bother keeping in touch?  If not, why should your stepmom, who should be treating you BETTER then this hypothetical acquaintance, get more leeway?  Drop contact let her solve her own problems for a while and if she apologizes for being awful consider letting her back into your life.  However considering she WANTS you to suffer, as there is no other explanation for demanding you go back to work, seeing as PTO is PAID TIME OFF it isn't about the money the only other explanation I can come up with is she just doesn't like that you're taking care of yourself do you really want someone who wants you to be miserable because she is in your life?", "This woman is a user and a mental abuser. Do not in any shape or form feel any sort of guilt for removing yourself from a hostile environment. She\u2019s a grownup and it\u2019s not your job to take care of her. You were also devastated by the loss of your father and in no way has she tried to help you with your pain. Instead she took advantage of your helpful nature. Discard this person. Some people really aren\u2019t worth it.", "NTA- she is mad and trying to manipulate you into staying by making you feel guilty for leaving and \u201cputting her in a bad spot\u201d. She is the reason she is in the spot she is, not you. It is her house and bills, not yours and used you to pay her way to live and keep a roof over her head. She was leeching off you and I\u2019m sure your dad also. Tell her good luck and move. Don\u2019t help her out anymore until she actually tries to help herself.", "NTA.\n\nShe's a vampirous leech.
