I, stupid as I was, put my full body weight on my injured arm trying to get on the chair (how hard can it be to sit down lol). There was a really loud snapping sound and my arm was fully broken.", "Christ, not the sister catching stray here.", "\n>Having no insurance isnt a sign of an irresponsible parent\n\nyes, it absolutely is. the dude has four kids, and is 61. he can get some god damn insurance.", "Yes I was waiting for the \"and my sister called Cps on me after laying into me for half an hour\" and...it never came! \n\nWtf is wrong with the sister? The whole family is rotten apparently.", "There's no way that her shared role in that lapse is on a par with LETTING HIS CHILD DRIVE A 4 WHEELER UNSUPERVISED."]}
