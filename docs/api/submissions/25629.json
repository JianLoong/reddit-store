Plus if you live in HIS apartment he won\u2019t let you live it down how he is doing you this huge favor", "NTA \n\nNope, No, NO Way!!!\n\nTell them that you will lock your doors and get a security system because you don't have time to clean up after someone else besides yourself. Also mention that you'd be uncomfortable with a guy living with you, that it doesn't necessarily mean you'd be safe and secure. \n\nIf they still persist in arguing, simply declare the subject closed and refuse to discuss it anymore. Hang up the phone, walk away.", "NTA! No way!\n\nCousin is happy with the arrangement, his family is happy, your family is happy.  The only person not happy is you.  They expect you to **both** pay rent **and** be the unpaid housekeeper? If all these people are unhappy with your refusal, that's their problem, not yours.\n\nKudos for holding your ground, telling it how it is, and maintaining your boundaries.\n\nIf you managed to secure a job in a different city, I'm confident you will also find affordable accommodation just for yourself and make a great start.", "For some reason I started hearing \"dueling banjos\" in the back of my head about halfway through this.", "NTA. I've been fortunate with my roommates in that our friction has been pretty minor overall. They, in the other hand, have had some horrible experiences and have flat out told me I'm the best roommate they've ever had. \n\nYou can see where this is going. Noping out sounds like the smart move.", "NTA of course! I find quite funny that your parents called you selfish for not wanting to move in with your cousin: why would that make you selfish? Because you won\u2019t mother him? If so, they are basically admitting that the point of having you two living together was because you could be your maid\u2026", "NTA because I agree, you\u2019ll get roped into being his maid\n\nBut also: Y-T-A for using the word \u201cWorser\u201d", "NTA. When you put up hard boundaries with people who are accustomed to getting away with disregarding any and all boundaries, they freak TF out. This in no way makes you an AH.

When I finally told them it's cause their son is a manchild and I didn't want to take care of him, they too blew up at me calling me various names.\n\nI mean if you go around calling people names you can hardly be shocked when others do the same to you.  Your reasons are valid enough, but there are ways of expressing things that don't pointlessly insult people.\n\nYTA, learn some tact and avoid making widespread judgements about people that you probably don't understand enough about.\n\n>My parents told me I can't afford to be this choosy and selfish. \n\nWell can you or can't you?  If you don't have a flatmate in mind and are expecting other people to pay then frankly you don't have a leg to stand on.  Suck it up and share or pay your own way.  Beggers can't be choosers.\n\n>The one day he did dishes in his house, everyone was applauding him as if he won some Nobel prize\n\nCome on now, do you mean he volunteered to do the dishes for everyone after being invited to a meal and was thanked and appreciated for volunteering.

You mothering him was at least part of the point.", "They are getting offended because their plan all along was for you to mother him while pretending like he is doing you a favor 'protecting' you.  Hold to your no, tell everyone to drop it, and just start cutting people off.  If you want to call his parents out on their plan, go ahead.   \n\n\nNTA.  \n\n\nTo be fair, I was a slob when I was 26, too, but I would not have been offended if someone had called me out on it.", "You would be the AH if you said it to his face which would be plain rude, but not in the context you've given.\n\nNTA", "NTA don\u2019t cave to their pressure. You are an adult and can make your own decisions", "NTA and this is very much the thing to be picky about when considering who to live with. Stay strong and don\u2019t let them guilt you.
