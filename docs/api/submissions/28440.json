Drug paraphernalia is dangerous, and people i  drugs are dangerously unpredictable.The kindness of letting him sleep there will unfortunately encourage other rough sleepers to join him, who may not be as polite. He will also, as time passes, start to build a nest of his own belongings, which will leave you unable to use your porch. There is also the risk of other users and dealers starting to frequent the cosy little corner.", "NTA.
