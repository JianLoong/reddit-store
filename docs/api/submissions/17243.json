NB: I\u2019m totally open to the idea I\u2019m TA here, I just need outside perspectives. \n\nI live with my girlfriend (her house), who has an adult daughter in her mid 20s, who also lives in the house. The daughter has always lived with her mum, I moved in 6 months ago. \n\nAll 3 of us work full time and we all earn about the same, give or a take a few grand/year. I give my GF more than double the \u201crent\u201d that her daughter gives her each month. My GF and I have a joint account, all the food and peripheral goods are bought 50/50 between us. The daughter eats that food and uses those resources too, but rarely buys anything.\n\nThe daughter hardly does anything around the house to contribute. Never cleans the kitchen, bathrooms, doesn\u2019t do food shopping, I don\u2019t think she even knows how to use a hoover, though she occasionally does the dishes and puts a wash on. \n\nI cook dinner for everyone most days, even though I\u2019m usually the last one home. My GF works hard and runs about doing chores in her spare time. The daughter lives in her bedroom 90% of the day, everyday, playing games. \n\nIf my GF is working away one night, I won\u2019t cook and will just grab a McDonald\u2019s for myself. I deliberately don\u2019t cook for both me and her daughter on these days just out of petty spite, because I know she\u2019ll be expecting me to, and will just leech off whatever it is I\u2019ve put the effort into making. \n\nThe daughter complains she has social anxiety and depression, but literally all her behaviours (poor diet, 0 exercise, infrequent socialising with her friends, lazy attitude) promote those kinds of problems. I often get depressed too but I still have adult responsibilities. Her mum, so I found out since moving in, is VERY coddling and her daughter (only child) has never had to lift a finger. I think that\u2019s where the laziness stems from. \n\nAnyway yesterday the resentment I\u2019ve been harbouring about all this bubbled over and I told my gf in a steady, though slightly irritable, manner that her daughter needs to do more, stop being lazy and that she (my gf) needs to ask her to contribute to food and chores. I also said that I don\u2019t want to pay for food her daughter eats or resources she uses anymore. My gf basically bit back, saying that it\u2019s her flesh and blood, and I\u2019m the male presence in the home who has an innate responsibility to provide for the household, and that we\u2019re pretty comfortable financially and what\u2019s the big deal, and I\u2019m being tight etc. I told my gf that I got into a relationship with her, not her daughter, and that I never wanted kids but feel like im having to support an adult child who should be standing on her own 2 feet. Safe to say she stopped talking to me for the rest of yesterday!\n\nAm I just being petty here, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684086662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13himcr/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_food_or_anything/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, but you need to re-read what you wrote: \"... I\u2019m the male presence in the home who has an innate responsibility to provide for the household,...\". This statement shows where the daughter's attitude comes from. Don't walk away from this situation, **RUN!**", ">Anyway yesterday the resentment I\u2019ve been harbouring about all this bubbled over\n\nUh-oh\n\n>I told her [...] her daughter needs to do more, stop being lazy\n\nN. T. A. for the first part of your title (not wanting to pay for the daughter's food), but Y. T. A. for your attitude. You joined a pre-existing household, and have the nerve to judge someone in that household for struggles/mental illnesses that you clearly don't understand at all.\n\nYour girlfriend's an AH for acting like *your* gender makes you responsible for *her* daughter. She's also being a bad parent by not getting her daughter the help she needs (therapy if appropriate, more structure if there isn't an underlying cause for her daughter's behavior, since it's clearly not sustainable indefinitely).\n\nYour girlfriend's daughter may or may not be an AH... It all depends on whether she genuinely is struggling or whether she is intentionally taking advantage of her mother and you. (My inclination is to believe she is genuinely struggling, regardless of whether she has a specific diagnosis... The only actual example of entitled behavior you describe is from your girlfriend, not the daughter)\n\nSo that works out to an ESH verdict", "\"Innate responsibility to provide for the household\". WTF. Daughter can provide for herself like all adults. If I was in your shoes I would be running as fast as I can...", "ESH\n\nBut not going to lie it was close for me to say you were the asshole, purely because of how you handled that conversation. \n\nYou\u2019re perfectly right to not want to support another adult, but I can\u2019t imagine that you had no idea about this daughter and the level of support she receives from her mom before you moved in. If you didn\u2019t than that\u2019s really bad research on your part. You should also have had a calm reasonable  conversation with your girlfriend when you realized it was an issue for you not waited until you boiled over and had a temper tantrum. \n\nYour girlfriend is an AH for saying you need to provide because you\u2019re a man. \n\nI\u2019m hesitant to put blame on the daughter because it sounds like she\u2019s been just living the life she\u2019s lead her whole life and it\u2019s not really on her if no one\u2019s ever demanded more.", "NTA - But I think this is not the relationship for you.", "NTA But it's time to move on because they are not going g to change. Why would they?", "You moved into the situation, but \u201cinnate male need to provide\u201d is bs. I can see not wanting to pay for her daughter and not having to cook and clean for her unless she also contributes to chores. Maybe this isn\u2019t the right relationship for you.", "Ooooh tricky. NTA for expecting the adult daughter to contribute more especially if she's working full time. Though is she saving up to allow herself to move out? \n\nHowever... I have a daughter. And I have no doubt she will be living here until her mid to late 20s too. If my boyfriend moved in when she was an adult and started telling me that she had to contribute more and pay more etc, I would be kicking him to the curb. Simply because that's my child. I don't care how old she is, I will ALWAYS provide for her if she needs it. \n\nBut... You shouldn't be expected to pay for her existence either. Basically the bills/rent/food costs all of it should be split into 3. You pay one third. Then the daughter and mum work out how their 2/3rds will be split. If mum doesn't want her daughter contributing as much, then she can cover the extra. Maybe they could split their 2/3rds of the bills into thirds and mum pays the bigger portion. This would be the solution I'd be giving to your gf. \n\nAs for the chores. If the girl is living essentially in her bedroom 90% of the time as you say... Then it's not really fair to expect her to do household chores outside of her room and bathroom. If she makes a mess elsewhere I'm sure she cleans up after herself? Just doesn't do a general clean of the entire house? I'd see it as she is renting a room in the house and that room is her responsibility. The rest of the house is on you and your gf. I'd expect her to do her own laundry (or if it's all put into the same load then I'd expect her to do a load of laundry occasionally), and do the dishes sometimes, but that's about it really. \n\nThe food situation- if you're cooking anyway, I don't really see the issue in making an extra portion and sounds like you're being petty for the sake of it because you resent the daughter for being there for free while you have to contribute, she's her daughter. You don't have kids so maybe you don't understand that bond, but if she's been a single mum for a long time and they've been together just them for a long time, you are the outsider I'm afraid, you've only been there a few months and you're already trying to change their dynamic... I wouldn't be shocked to hear your gf kicks you out after this because for me my kid comes first every time and you've just insulted her child. \n\nIf you want to keep this relationship, apologise and ask for a compromise (such as I've mentioned above) because no you're NTA for not wanting to pay for her kids living situation at all, but the way you've gone about it is very AH-ey.", "I mean, you're not wrong, but you're never going to convince either of them that children, ESPECIALLY adult children NEED responsibility . At the rate they're going, the daughter will be 60, still living at home, having allowed life to simply pass her by while her mother spends her retirement trapped in a hell of her own making. Since you'll never be able to convince your gf of that since she's already decided you're overstepping by mentioning it at all, the only choice you have is to walk away now or waste your life watching them waste theirs.", "Info: who pays the bills? How much is your rent in comparison to the mortgage?\n\n>All 3 of us work full time and we all earn about the same\n\n>The daughter lives in her bedroom 90% of the day, everyday, playing games. \n\nHow can these both be true?", "You knew the daughter's age and your GF's living situation before you moved in and **you moved in anyway**. Her daughter didn't suddenly change to be an inconvenience to you. It's not fair for you to expect it to change as you have only been there 6 months. It sounds like her daughter was pitching in financially prior to you joining the household and your GF most likely counted on it. You admit that you do things to be petty rather than working towards a solution that could possibly help. So.. YTA.", "Edit. (Nearly) ESH\nDid you know this was the household dynamic before you recently moved in?\n\nI was originally an info post, but even as I typed it out I realised that you are probably TA.\n\nMother and daughter have been living together fine for a while, I\u2019m not sure how you think it is OK to impose your will over how the household is run since you moved in. So that is why you suck. \n\nYou talk about depression in a way that shows you know fuck all about it. The daughters behaviours are SYMPTOMS of it. You suck for that too. \n\n> I\u2019m the male presence in the home who has an innate responsibility to provide for the household\n\nYour girlfriend sucks because of this bullshit from the middle of last century. \n\nThe only person here who does not suck is the daughter. Sure, she could do more around the house but is it her fault that she doesn\u2019t? Has she been brought up to help around the house? Was there an expectation she did before you moved in?\n\n(Arguably another reason your GF sucks, but not really for this thread. )", "NTA and how quickly are you moving out?", "YTA, let's break it down.\n\nYou knew the daughter was there before you moved in, so if you didn't want to have an adult child in the home, it's your own damn fault. It was her home before it was yours, they had the arrangement they had before you moved in.\n\nYou accuse her of doing nothing, but also say she earns the same amount of money as you do. So clearly she's doing SOMETHING.\n\nDepression is more than just being a lil sad and going about your day. All of those things you think \"cause\" depression are SYMPTOMS of depression. \n\nYou are being a petty, little man trying to assert his dominance in a household that apparently operated just fine before you go there. I'd suggest moving out.", "Info What was the conversation about before you moved in? You would have discussed expectations, chores, and the daughter, right? How does this conversation need to be revisited and reimagined?", "NTA but you are a fool if you don't think you are dating them both. It's a package deal. You are not just dating her... And she would easily choose her daughter over you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now you have to make a choice and be cool with it.", "NTA but nothing is going to change. Mom will keep enabling her daughter to be a bum and do nothing. Both will continue to resent you for trying to get daughter to grow up and be an adult. \n\nLike it or not, mom and her adult daughter are a package deal. You have two options - deal with things the way they are or move out.", "NTA I fully understand your emotions .. first thing you definitely need to do is untangle your money from your gf asap and only put into that joint account what you are willing to part with.. you should be only paying 1/3 part of all total bills nothing more , you aren\u2019t married and you\u2019ve put yourself in a position where you\u2019re not going to win this fight\u2026if gf won\u2019t force her daughter take care of herself and using a disorder (that in all likelihood hasn\u2019t been medically proven) as an excuse maybe you moving in was not the best move. I hope I\u2019m wrong but if what I\u2019m thinking is correct gf daughter will be the cause of this relationship not working out, as you said you feel some sort of way towards her mooching off of you. Try to talk to gf again and if it the conversation ends up with another argument it\u2019s up to you how far you gonna let this go before you make a decision to leave or put up with this for years grudgingly", "YTA, a single mom comes with the baggage and unless you are able to accept it as one bundle, its best not to be involved with them. You cannot pick and choose. Either suck up to it and enjoy the relationship or get out. Unless you can love her and her daughter as your own, its game over.", "YTA\n\nYou are not the primary relationship in your gfs life.

You aren't the kid's father, teacher, or therapist, who asked you for your opinion?\n\nGet with the program as is, at present, and figure out how to engage graciously, or move out so that your home is the place you can be in without resentment. \n\nDon't date women with kids, if you can't deal with the parent-child dynamic.", "You moved in six months ago and your trying to parent (or anti patent) there adult child", "ESH and I hope you find a new place to live soon \n\nHer daughter isn\u2019t going to be asked to leave you will\nBe", "NTA \n\nA thousand times NO!\n\nYou are absolutely in the right here and it sounds like your gf didn't like the truth being presented to her.
