NB: I\u2019m totally open to the idea I\u2019m TA here, I just need outside perspectives. \n\nI live with my girlfriend (her house), who has an adult daughter in her mid 20s, who also lives in the house. The daughter has always lived with her mum, I moved in 6 months ago. \n\nAll 3 of us work full time and we all earn about the same, give or a take a few grand/year. I give my GF more than double the \u201crent\u201d that her daughter gives her each month. My GF and I have a joint account, all the food and peripheral goods are bought 50/50 between us. The daughter eats that food and uses those resources too, but rarely buys anything.\n\nThe daughter hardly does anything around the house to contribute. Never cleans the kitchen, bathrooms, doesn\u2019t do food shopping, I don\u2019t think she even knows how to use a hoover, though she occasionally does the dishes and puts a wash on. \n\nI cook dinner for everyone most days, even though I\u2019m usually the last one home. My GF works hard and runs about doing chores in her spare time. The daughter lives in her bedroom 90% of the day, everyday, playing games. \n\nIf my GF is working away one night, I won\u2019t cook and will just grab a McDonald\u2019s for myself. I deliberately don\u2019t cook for both me and her daughter on these days just out of petty spite, because I know she\u2019ll be expecting me to, and will just leech off whatever it is I\u2019ve put the effort into making. \n\nThe daughter complains she has social anxiety and depression, but literally all her behaviours (poor diet, 0 exercise, infrequent socialising with her friends, lazy attitude) promote those kinds of problems. I often get depressed too but I still have adult responsibilities. Her mum, so I found out since moving in, is VERY coddling and her daughter (only child) has never had to lift a finger. I think that\u2019s where the laziness stems from. \n\nAnyway yesterday the resentment I\u2019ve been harbouring about all this bubbled over and I told my gf in a steady, though slightly irritable, manner that her daughter needs to do more, stop being lazy and that she (my gf) needs to ask her to contribute to food and chores. I also said that I don\u2019t want to pay for food her daughter eats or resources she uses anymore. My gf basically bit back, saying that it\u2019s her flesh and blood, and I\u2019m the male presence in the home who has an innate responsibility to provide for the household, and that we\u2019re pretty comfortable financially and what\u2019s the big deal, and I\u2019m being tight etc. I told my gf that I got into a relationship with her, not her daughter, and that I never wanted kids but feel like im having to support an adult child who should be standing on her own 2 feet. Safe to say she stopped talking to me for the rest of yesterday!\n\nAm I just being petty here, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684086662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13himcr/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_food_or_anything/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, but you need to re-read what you wrote: \"... I\u2019m the male presence in the home who has an innate responsibility to provide for the household,...\". This statement shows where the daughter's attitude comes from. Don't walk away from this situation, **RUN!**", ">Anyway yesterday the resentment I\u2019ve been harbouring about all this bubbled over\n\nUh-oh\n\n>I told her [...] her daughter needs to do more, stop being lazy\n\nN. T. A. for the first part of your title (not wanting to pay for the daughter's food), but Y. T. A. for your attitude. You joined a pre-existing household, and have the nerve to judge someone in that household for struggles/mental illnesses that you clearly don't understand at all.\n\nYour girlfriend's an AH for acting like *your* gender makes you responsible for *her* daughter. She's also being a bad parent by not getting her daughter the help she needs (therapy if appropriate, more structure if there isn't an underlying cause for her daughter's behavior, since it's clearly not sustainable indefinitely).\n\nYour girlfriend's daughter may or may not be an AH... It all depends on whether she genuinely is struggling or whether she is intentionally taking advantage of her mother and you. (My inclination is to believe she is genuinely struggling, regardless of whether she has a specific diagnosis... The only actual example of entitled behavior you describe is from your girlfriend, not the daughter)\n\nSo that works out to an ESH verdict", "\"Innate responsibility to provide for the household\". WTF. Daughter can provide for herself like all adults. If I was in your shoes I would be running as fast as I can...", "ESH\n\nBut not going to lie it was close for me to say you were the asshole, purely because of how you handled that conversation. \n\nYou\u2019re perfectly right to not want to support another adult, but I can\u2019t imagine that you had no idea about this daughter and the level of support she receives from her mom before you moved in. If you didn\u2019t than that\u2019s really bad research on your part. You should also have had a calm reasonable  conversation with your girlfriend when you realized it was an issue for you not waited until you boiled over and had a temper tantrum. \n\nYour girlfriend is an AH for saying you need to provide because you\u2019re a man. \n\nI\u2019m hesitant to put blame on the daughter because it sounds like she\u2019s been just living the life she\u2019s lead her whole life and it\u2019s not really on her if no one\u2019s ever demanded more.", "NTA - But I think this is not the relationship for you.", "NTA But it's time to move on because they are not going g to change. Why would they?", "You moved into the situation, but \u201cinnate male need to provide\u201d is bs. I can see not wanting to pay for her daughter and not having to cook and clean for her unless she also contributes to chores. Maybe this isn\u2019t the right relationship for you.", "Ooooh tricky. NTA for expecting the adult daughter to contribute more especially if she's working full time. Though is she saving up to allow herself to move out? \n\nHowever... I have a daughter. And I have no doubt she will be living here until her mid to late 20s too. If my boyfriend moved in when she was an adult and started telling me that she had to contribute more and pay more etc, I would be kicking him to the curb. Simply because that's my child. I don't care how old she is, I will ALWAYS provide for her if she needs it. \n\nBut... You shouldn't be expected to pay for her existence either. Basically the bills/rent/food costs all of it should be split into 3. You pay one third. Then the daughter and mum work out how their 2/3rds will be split. If mum doesn't want her daughter contributing as much, then she can cover the extra. Maybe they could split their 2/3rds of the bills into thirds and mum pays the bigger portion. This would be the solution I'd be giving to your gf. \n\nAs for the chores. If the girl is living essentially in her bedroom 90% of the time as you say... Then it's not really fair to expect her to do household chores outside of her room and bathroom. If she makes a mess elsewhere I'm sure she cleans up after herself? Just doesn't do a general clean of the entire house? I'd see it as she is renting a room in the house and that room is her responsibility. The rest of the house is on you and your gf. I'd expect her to do her own laundry (or if it's all put into the same load then I'd expect her to do a load of laundry occasionally), and do the dishes sometimes, but that's about it really. \n\nThe food situation- if you're cooking anyway, I don't really see the issue in making an extra portion and sounds like you're being petty for the sake of it because you resent the daughter for being there for free while you have to contribute, she's her daughter. You don't have kids so maybe you don't understand that bond, but if she's been a single mum for a long time and they've been together just them for a long time, you are the outsider I'm afraid, you've only been there a few months and you're already trying to change their dynamic... I wouldn't be shocked to hear your gf kicks you out after this because for me my kid comes first every time and you've just insulted her child. \n\nIf you want to keep this relationship, apologise and ask for a compromise (such as I've mentioned above) because no you're NTA for not wanting to pay for her kids living situation at all, but the way you've gone about it is very AH-ey.", "I mean, you're not wrong, but you're never going to convince either of them that children, ESPECIALLY adult children NEED responsibility . At the rate they're going, the daughter will be 60, still living at home, having allowed life to simply pass her by while her mother spends her retirement trapped in a hell of her own making. Since you'll never be able to convince your gf of that since she's already decided you're overstepping by mentioning it at all, the only choice you have is to walk away now or waste your life watching them waste theirs.", "Info: who pays the bills? How much is your rent in comparison to the mortgage?\n\n>All 3 of us work full time and we all earn about the same\n\n>The daughter lives in her bedroom 90% of the day, everyday, playing games. \n\nHow can these both be true?", "You knew the daughter's age and your GF's living situation before you moved in and **you moved in anyway**. Her daughter didn't suddenly change to be an inconvenience to you. It's not fair for you to expect it to change as you have only been there 6 months. It sounds like her daughter was pitching in financially prior to you joining the household and your GF most likely counted on it. You admit that you do things to be petty rather than working towards a solution that could possibly help. So.. YTA.", "Edit. (Nearly) ESH\nDid you know this was the household dynamic before you recently moved in?\n\nI was originally an info post, but even as I typed it out I realised that you are probably TA.\n\nMother and daughter have been living together fine for a while, I\u2019m not sure how you think it is OK to impose your will over how the household is run since you moved in. So that is why you suck. \n\nYou talk about depression in a way that shows you know fuck all about it. The daughters behaviours are SYMPTOMS of it. You suck for that too. \n\n> I\u2019m the male presence in the home who has an innate responsibility to provide for the household\n\nYour girlfriend sucks because of this bullshit from the middle of last century. \n\nThe only person here who does not suck is the daughter. Sure, she could do more around the house but is it her fault that she doesn\u2019t? Has she been brought up to help around the house? Was there an expectation she did before you moved in?\n\n(Arguably another reason your GF sucks, but not really for this thread. )", "NTA and how quickly are you moving out?", "YTA, let's break it down.\n\nYou knew the daughter was there before you moved in, so if you didn't want to have an adult child in the home, it's your own damn fault. It was her home before it was yours, they had the arrangement they had before you moved in.\n\nYou accuse her of doing nothing, but also say she earns the same amount of money as you do. So clearly she's doing SOMETHING.\n\nDepression is more than just being a lil sad and going about your day. All of those things you think \"cause\" depression are SYMPTOMS of depression. \n\nYou are being a petty, little man trying to assert his dominance in a household that apparently operated just fine before you go there. I'd suggest moving out.", "Info What was the conversation about before you moved in? You would have discussed expectations, chores, and the daughter, right? How does this conversation need to be revisited and reimagined?", "NTA but you are a fool if you don't think you are dating them both. It's a package deal. You are not just dating her... And she would easily choose her daughter over you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now you have to make a choice and be cool with it.", "NTA but nothing is going to change. Mom will keep enabling her daughter to be a bum and do nothing. Both will continue to resent you for trying to get daughter to grow up and be an adult. \n\nLike it or not, mom and her adult daughter are a package deal. You have two options - deal with things the way they are or move out.", "NTA I fully understand your emotions .. first thing you definitely need to do is untangle your money from your gf asap and only put into that joint account what you are willing to part with.. you should be only paying 1/3 part of all total bills nothing more , you aren\u2019t married and you\u2019ve put yourself in a position where you\u2019re not going to win this fight\u2026if gf won\u2019t force her daughter take care of herself and using a disorder (that in all likelihood hasn\u2019t been medically proven) as an excuse maybe you moving in was not the best move. I hope I\u2019m wrong but if what I\u2019m thinking is correct gf daughter will be the cause of this relationship not working out, as you said you feel some sort of way towards her mooching off of you. Try to talk to gf again and if it the conversation ends up with another argument it\u2019s up to you how far you gonna let this go before you make a decision to leave or put up with this for years grudgingly", "YTA, a single mom comes with the baggage and unless you are able to accept it as one bundle, its best not to be involved with them.

Unfortunately it\u2019s not helping the daughter at all", "WHY are you living with them?", "NTA and this.  The mom is never going to stop supporting the daughter and expects you to do the same, if you didn't want to adopt an adult child, time to go.", "Yeah I was leaning Y T A due to moving into an established household and demanding changes right up until gf brought out the \"your penis makes you responsible for providing for us\", bc yikes. Absolutely an ESH. Whether it's laziness or mental illness, daughter should be doing more; OP shouldn't waltz into an established home and decide he gets to start making changes within only a few months of living there; gf needs to step up and parent (and also get over the weird gender Thing she's apparently got going on). Nobody is looking good here. It's a mess.", "He is paying all the bills because his gf owns the house and is paying her mortgage alone. His \"rent\" is covering the household expenses.", "I'm a depression sufferer and as far as I'm concerned it's not an excuse to live of others.  She works so she should pitch in with groceries at least.", "The issue isn't the fact the adult daughter lives in the home, it's that they all work ft with similar incomes yet he pays twice what the daughter does for rent, daughter eats the food that OP pays for half of yet doesn't contribute to food etc, doesn't cook or clean.\n\nOP signed on for a relationship with gf, not to cook, buy groceries and clean for her adult child.", "why would you think something that is already established would be temporary", "So how much is the rent you pay (which actually covers the bills) in comparison to her mortgage? \n\nAnd what is the money her daughter is paying going towards? Perhaps they made an arrangement that her rent payment covers food and bills too. When you arrived and agreed to pay all the food bills, it should have been mentioned that you'd be buying hers too. Was it?", "Then the mortgage cost and the bills all need to be worked out and divided by 3 and he just pays up to that third. Before he moved in, the gf would have had all the same bills. Him moving in will just have made food and utilities go up slightly so he shouldn't be covering more than 1/3rd", "but she already lived there why would you assume she was leaving?", "The 3rd part of your comment could even be true and has made me think this whole situation is even more fucked up than I initially thought.", "I tried to ask what the difference is between what he pays and what the mortgage payment is, he hasn't answered yet. As she also pays for half of the food costs, I would guess that she probably already covers more than half of the expenses. But it's hard to know with the info OP has given.", "Agreed with the limited info on financials it's hard to really judge properly! \n\nA mortgage can vary massively! Some can be a couple of hundred a month others over a grand a month it really all depends on a lot of factors \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I don't think most people are saying that the daughter's situation is healthy or okay.  I think everyone is saying that YOU should have been aware of the relationship dynamics before you decided to move in.  How is it that you knew so little about your gf's relationship with her daughter when it sounds like they're extremely codependent?  I understand your frustrations, but it's entirely unrealistic to expect this dynamic to change.", "He says that he pays quite a lot for the bills, and that the daughter pays half what she does. So perhaps she is already (technically) contributing to the food costs, as that money is being spent on something. So many factors that make it impossible to judge. \n\nIf OP is paying the same amount (or even more) than his gf, then he's definitely partly subsidising the daughter (or fully subsidising his gf, and she's paying for her daughter.. which could be how she sees it.. who knows). If what he's paying amounts to a third or less, and the gf has chosen to give her child a 50% discount and cover the rest herself, then he needs to back off and let her choose what to do with her money. He might have a point about her joining in with chores, but as she spends all her free time in her room, I doubt she's really the one messing up the house... And he took really the wrong approach with the subject!", "Yeah if the mum is covering her daughter's part then it has nothing to do with him. And the household chores as you say...she spends all her free time in her room... Why should she be cleaning their mess up for them. If she was renting a room from someone in a house who wasn't family, she'd not be expected to clean their living areas as well as her own \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I have to say a sympathetic YTA.\n\nI think your reasoning is valid BUT you are living in your GF's house, she sets the rules for her daughter...right or wrong.\n\nMove out, whether you continue the relationship or not. You are only going to grow more and more resentful and then it will really blow up.", "Well, this part caught my eye, when your gf told you that you are ...\n\n>the male presence in the home who has an innate responsibility to provide for the household\n\nand that, my friend, is blatantly sexist. Is that why she moved you in, so you could help take care of her and her daughter?\n\nIt sounds like you go above and beyond, doing at least your \"share\" of maintaining a household. But you've got no power, and the daughter is never going to shape up or ship out.\n\nMaybe it would be better for you to have your own place for a while, see if you really want to continue this relationship, now that you know more about it from living inside this dynamic for a few months.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA, your gf is an enabler and isn\u2019t letting her grow up. It\u2019s weird no one else sees that or just doesn\u2019t understand that the gf needs to make changes and OP being there shld b an indicator of change.

What was your roommate agreement when you moved into your girlfriend's and girlfriend's daughter's home?\n\n<QUOTE>\n\nAITA for not wanting to pay for food or anything else for my GF\u2019s adult daughter, and expecting her to do more? (self.AmItheAsshole)\n\nsubmitted 7 hours ago * by throwaway74663378\n\nSome details changed as the daughter goes on Reddit. NB: I\u2019m totally open to the idea I\u2019m TA here, I just need outside perspectives.\n\nI live with my girlfriend (her house), who has an adult daughter in her mid 20s, who also lives in the house. The daughter has always lived with her mum, I moved in 6 months ago.\n\nAll 3 of us work full time and we all earn about the same, give or a take a few grand/year. I give my GF more than double the \u201crent\u201d that her daughter gives her each month. My GF and I have a joint account, all the food and peripheral goods are bought 50/50 between us. The daughter eats that food and uses those resources too, but rarely buys anything.\n\nThe daughter hardly does anything around the house to contribute. Never cleans the kitchen, bathrooms, doesn\u2019t do food shopping, I don\u2019t think she even knows how to use a hoover, though she occasionally does the dishes and puts a wash on.\n\nI cook dinner for everyone most days, even though I\u2019m usually the last one home. My GF works hard and runs about doing chores in her spare time. The daughter lives in her bedroom 90% of the day, everyday, playing games.\n\nIf my GF is working away one night, I won\u2019t cook and will just grab a McDonald\u2019s for myself. I deliberately don\u2019t cook for both me and her daughter on these days just out of petty spite, because I know she\u2019ll be expecting me to, and will just leech off whatever it is I\u2019ve put the effort into making.\n\nThe daughter complains she has social anxiety and depression, but literally all her behaviours (poor diet, 0 exercise, infrequent socialising with her friends, lazy attitude) promote those kinds of problems. I often get depressed too but I still have adult responsibilities. Her mum, so I found out since moving in, is VERY coddling and her daughter (only child) has never had to lift a finger. I think that\u2019s where the laziness stems from.\n\nAnyway yesterday the resentment I\u2019ve been harbouring about all this bubbled over and I told my gf in a steady, though slightly irritable, manner that her daughter needs to do more, stop being lazy and that she (my gf) needs to ask her to contribute to food and chores. I also said that I don\u2019t want to pay for food her daughter eats or resources she uses anymore. My gf basically bit back, saying that it\u2019s her flesh and blood, and I\u2019m the male presence in the home who has an innate responsibility to provide for the household, and that we\u2019re pretty comfortable financially and what\u2019s the big deal, and I\u2019m being tight etc. I told my gf that I got into a relationship with her, not her daughter, and that I never wanted kids but feel like im having to support an adult child who should be standing on her own 2 feet. Safe to say she stopped talking to me for the rest of yesterday!\n\nAm I just being petty here, AITA?\n\n<QUOTE>", "ESH\nIt isn't your job to provide for a household, but I find it hard to sympathise with someone who says \"I get depressed sometimes but blah blah blah\". NO. You don't have depression, you get sad sometimes. You have no idea what it is or how it screws you around. Grow some empathy. \n\nSee also, maybe don't hook up with someone who has kids if you never wanted them. Even grown ones living at home.", "Well you described your own behavior as petty, so .....", "ESH.\n\nJust pack. Nothing is going to happen. She clearly believes her daughter is at least partly your responsibility, being that you're the man of the house. \n\nGet thee to a condo!", "Time to move on to greener pastures.", "Your girlfriend isn\u2019t doing her daughter any favours. She needs to step up and contribute more. NTA.", "Yta to yourself. Move on.", "Mate, I think you and your GF have gone past your \"sell by\" date.", "she is clearly taking advantage. mid 20s and not helping. alongside that, if he lives there and sees that she's not actively doing something to help the situation then she most definitely is in the wrong. I think the only part that deems him an AH is the fact that he held it in for so long.", "Lol same! But chronic pain since I was a pre-teen. Diagnosed at 40+ as arthritis. Surgeon said I'm too young for them to give a hoot! Yay me! \nAvoid doing anything that hurts, lose weight, and pain meds. Thanks Dr, very helpful.", "You have zero authority to be deciding what SHOULD or SHOULDN'T be, or what other people's responsibilities are in this household. Your only decision is whether you accept the situation that has been offered to you, or leave. \n\nI personally find your attitude appallingly arrogant. It is not your house. It is not your family. Just because you assume things should be a certain way doesn't mean other people feel the same, and that is fine. The only one who gets to judge the daughter's actions is her mother.", "He's the asshole because it's not his house. The daughter was there before he was, he moved into HER home, not the other way around. If he doesn't like it, he should move out.", "Yes, he did sign on for it when he moved into the household that was already run that way. if he didn't want that living situation, he should not have moved it. It was the daughter's home before it was his.", "My eldest pays board, which is food, utilities and rent. It's pretty common and I reckon you're right.", "With the REASONABLE expectation that an adult is picking up after themselves", "Going to have to go with ESH - the title premise is fine, you can have a conversation about how you don\u2019t want to pay for food she eats ect, if the kid isn\u2019t paying a fair share then it\u2019s your GF\u2019s job to take over that part of it. \n\nHowever where you become an asshole is pretending you getting sad sometimes means you understand her mental health conditions, the things you complained about in that section are symptoms, yes she should be getting therapy and treatment  but \u2018being more social will fix your social anxiety\u2019  is just a ridiculous statement. \n\nAlso the the kid is far beyond the age where you can become anything remotely parental so stop trying to get involved parenting wise and stop making requests for her to do chores, it\u2019s not your house and it\u2019s not your kid.", "Your girlfriend needs to break up with you. You need to move out. You moved into their house and are now complaining about her daughter. That's not cool. Your girlfriend is not cool for saying you're a man so you need to provide. I don't know about the daughter. \n\nESH but maybe not the daughter because I'm not touching your comments because a lot of them don't sound correct or show you don't understand clinical depression.", "NTA. However, you aren't going to win this battle.  Your girlfriend and her daughter she too entrenched in their dynamic and don't see an issue. Time to start sorting yourself out and get your own place lined up. This relationship isn't going to last.", "NTA\n\nJust run! Your gf was looking for a provider cause her daughter doesn\u2019t count. Just run!", "I think you should move out asap. This living situation clearly isn\u2019t working for you and they are pretty set in their ways. You probably could continue the relationship without all that drama. \n\nYou got to recognize you can only change what\u2019s within your power and go from there.", "NTA But this is so easy. You want to be in a relationship with a woman who is raising her child to be a contributing and respectful member of society. You want to live in a household where chores and other responsibilities are shared equitably and respectfully. Your partner is not the woman who is going to facilitate these wants.  \nYou have a decision to make.", "ESH and I don't think you're going to change anyone here.", "If daughter can hold an adult job, she\u2019s being lazy and your GF is contributing to her infantile behavior. Get out brother. It will never ever change.", "NTA.  She is always going to \u201c support\u201dand \u201chelp\u201d her daughter.   I have the quotes because she is not being a good mum.   A good mum raises a child to be a functioning adult, not a leech.   I say leech because the daughter is making the same money as you and her mother but she is not contributing either finically or with unpaid work such as chores.   The sexism of your girlfriend about your being a man and needing to contribute more is b&llsh$t.   And I am woman.   Womencan take care of ourselves.  Even though you are NTA you need to look for new housing.   Your GF and her daughter are a disfinctional pair.", "ESH \n\nIt's extremely common for parents to not require their children to pay a literal half of the bills. No matter how old the children are, but particularly in their 20s. Expecting the adult daughter to pay as much to the household as you is ridiculous, because she's living in her mother's house...her mother doesn't want to really charge her much for living there, and that's a VERY common thing for mothers to do. \n\nHOWEVER \n\nYou as the boyfriend of only 6 mo should not be expected to pay the daughter's bills either. This was a conversation to have calmly with the mother.  If you could not come to an agreement about a fair split for bills (mother pays 2/3 and you pay 1/3, at the most), you should not have moved in or you should move out.  It sounds like you guys aren't compatible on this point based on the mother's weird statement about you being the provider, but I don't know if she just felt pushed to say something that ridiculous because you were pretty brazenly insulting her daughter, who is clearly struggling. I guess you could try talking to her again about a more fair bill split, and apologize for taking your frustration about the situation out on the daughter. If you want. But idk.", "Agree. Run. Unless you want this to be your life.", "Plus from what he said about the daughter it could also be depression/anxiety. People still think having depression means being sad. What he described about the daughter are symtpoms.  Of course it also could mean laziness or mother's teaching.", "please for the love of god learn about what it actually entails to have depression and what living with that condition is like \n\nlike realistically if she was living in her own with her depression chances are those chores wouldn\u2019t be done anyways or she would only be in part time employment", "We don\u2019t have enough info about the rent. Most parents charge their young adult kids a small rent. So comparing a relatively new boyfriend\u2019s rent to the girlfriend\u2019s daughter\u2019s amount actually made him seem childish to me.  For instance, if the daughter pays $250 rent and he pays $500, he probably pays way less than he did on his own and much less than half of what the rent would be and is living pretty cheaply."]}
