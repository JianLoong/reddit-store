One of my friends also invited me to his party, which had a lot more people I knew. However, I chose to go to the smaller gathering with my girlfriend because her friends were there.\n\nAfter the new years countdown, I changed my mind and I wanted to go to my friends party since there was less than 20 people at my girlfriends party and I didn't know anybody except some of my girlfriends friends. So, I decided I was going to Uber to the other party. My girlfriend intially didn't want to come along, but I told my her I didn't want to leave without her so we went together.\n\nWe decided on ordering a Shared Uber with other passengers since it was $10 cheaper, but this was a mistake. At this point I had probably taken about 8 shots and I barely was able to order the Uber. After struggling to get in the car and put my seatbelt on, we were in the Uber. The drive to the party was about 40 minutes away, but we had a couple stops along the way to pick up the other passengers.\n\nAfter we drove for about 30 minutes, it was about 12:30 at this point, the other passengers we picked up got dropped off and I assumed we were getting close. So, when I started recongnizing the area, I guessed that we were the next stop. At the next stop I thanked the Uber and got out. Everything was fine until I realized that we had gotten off early and were 8 blocks from the party.\n\nSince, I was pretty drunk and didn't really know the area too well and this was a genunine mistake. After realizing my mistake I told my girlfriend and she was immediately pissed off. She begain swearing at me calling me a \"F\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Idiot\" and \"F\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Stupid\" and telling me that I made a dumb mistake. I can understand why she would be upset and I still feel bad for making us get off the wrong stop, but what she said was pretty disrespetful.\n\nThis isn't even the first time this has happened. One time we were biking back home from a park while high and I made a wrong turn. This turn made us have to turn around and go back to where we came from and my girlfriend had the same reaction.\n\nBoth instances she apologized immediately after, but even after an apology it hurts to be called \"Stupid\" and \"Dumb\" by someone you love.\n\nWe ended up making it to the party but by the time we got there I wasn't in a good mood and I didn't want to stay out anymore, so we eventually ubered back home.\n\nThis morning my girlfriend didn't want to talk about it. I told her I felt misstreated and she said sorry and just shrugged it off. I don't want to hold a gruge aganist her, but it doesn't seem fair just to forget about it.\n\nI can 100% agree that it was my mistake for getting off the stop early but I didn't deserve to be verbally abused for it.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1704176104, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wihnn/aita_for_making_my_girlfriend_leave_a_party_with/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It looked like your drinking clouded your decision making skills. Try to avoid getting yourself to that point in the future. It would lower the amount of grief you would of experienced.", "It sounds like you have some substance abuse issues which lead to you making really bad choices. Perhaps her reaction is to that, and to how scary it is to be dropped off late at night in a strange place - sadly, especially for women. You show zero concern about endangering her, or ruining her night. YTA.", "She knew I wanted to go to the party with my friends and I told her I would stay with her until after the countdown. She agreed to coming it wasn't like I forced her to come with me.", "That's not what you said in your post. You said you changed your mind after the countdown and that you were leaving...and that she didn't want to go with you.", "I'm not really sure there's a difference. I was at one party and then wanted to leave was all. It doesn't really matter when I changed my mind. \n\nI told her I wanted to go to the other party and I wanted to her to come with me. I may have accidentially made her feel pressured to come with me (At most) but in no means did I force her to come with me."]}
