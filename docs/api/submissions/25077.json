I thought I had showed him them before (for context we\u2019ve been together for just about a year and a half), but he said I never did. I was pretty excited as I\u2019m very proud of my piano skills. I took lessons from 6-16 then completely stopped playing for like 12 years and when I picked it back up at 28 I was somehow better than I had ever been when I took lessons, I think it\u2019s because I was finally passionate about it. \n\nAnyway, he seemed pretty excited to watch the videos and I was equally excited to share. So I find the first video to show him (it\u2019s me playing and singing \u201cStay\u201d by Rihanna), he says \u201coh I know that song!\u201d I hit play and the first words out of his mouth? \u201cYou\u2019re off tempo\u201d \n\u2026\nNow, I\u2019m proud of my piano skills, but I\u2019m not delusional, I\u2019m of intermediate skill level, and I need a TON of practice.

So for something negative to be the first thing out of his mouth, and about my tempo no less, hurt me. So I immediately shut down and quickly turned the video off and said \u201cNever mind\u201d. He told me to turn it back on and I said \u201cno, maybe some other time\u201d and he again insisted I just put my phone away and said \u201cno it\u2019s okay\u201d.

Overall, not a major deal though and I would have thought he would just take on board that you didn\u2019t particularly want criticism in these situations and that would be it.   \n\n\nWhat I find more concerning than either his insensitive comment or your slight overreaction is that he is now sitting you out and putting you in a position to console him. Particularly given that this seems to be a pattern of behaviour for him, this would be a major red flag for me (done that, got the t-shirt, what not).

Oh he wanted me out because he felt like he\u2019d done everything in his power to help me get help(therapy) and get a job but I hadn\u2019t in the year we\u2019ve been together so he felt like pushing me out of the nest (so to speak) would be the best way to make me step up.", "You\u2019re right.

Someone who was right for you in one phase of your life (in crisis, in this example) is not necessarily the person who will be right for you long term. Whilst it feels skeezy on the surface, maintaining a relationship because of a sense of obligation is not healthy for anyone long term. \n\nYou can talk to him, express, clearly and without blame (using 'I' statements helps this) how you feel and what you want to see improve,  you can settle for this and accept that he's unlikely to change without prompt (and possibly even with it), or you can leave, but for fuck sake, don't make any of those choices based on a misplaced sense of obligation based on history and trauma: those are not good decision making aides!!", "That was a relationship based on you being crazed and out it.

Doesn't mean he's justified, but also you're putting yourself in that position and expecting him to change ... He's keeping the both of you afloat and helping you survive, he probably thinks you should cut him some slack in his lack of emotional maturity.. \n\nOr he is not partner material and can't see you for being your own person and counts you as an extension of him since he's the one providing.. \n\nI commented on your post that this was an ESH situation.. this comment of yours only further solidifies that judgement and tilting it towards a soft YTA. Because as much as you cry emotional manipulation, we don't know anything of how far your partner goes to provide for both of you and what he has to put up with. \n\nIf your only reason to stay with him is the fact that he provides, then you're no good partner either.", ">a critique wouldn\u2019t be the first thing out of my mouth. \n\nThat doesn't mean everyone else has to be that way. I'm a person who has like 0 creativity. So I don't understand things like paintings, music, movies etc etc. And I always 100% find fault with these kind of works (my tastes are different).. but everyone around me knows this is exactly who I am.. they know I'd always encourage them to excel in whatever they like, but it wouldn't be in a manner they want. So if they wanna hear \"OMG your music is the best\" there's no point in coming to me.. I wouldn't be able to say that.. but if they want someone to come watch their performance and cheer them on I'd be there.. if they wanted someone to stay up late nights with them for their practice session and just make coffee, I would.. but I can see myself saying something like your bf did.. not exactly as a critique but because IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE and if that's the first thing that jumps at you from a music video the first impression is already bad.. and as an adult the general assumption is you're mature enough to take negative comments.. \n\n>he still won\u2019t speak to me\n\nSo I don't know how your relationship works, but with mine it's kinda established that the person who caused the problem should make the first step in mending things even if the other partner is partly at fault. In this particular scenario (even my previous comment was on that alone) you seemed to have caused the rift. Your bf didn't know about it being a sensitive topic and instead of telling him that you shut down without explaining why.. so you started ignoring him first .. you can't expect him to take accountability for no fault of his own (combining this incident to all others in your relationship is a different matter I cannot comment on).. \n\n>He wants me to grovel and ask for forgiveness\n\nDon't do that.. but in this instance be the person to reach out and start the conversation to solve this.. and try and keep the conversation to this incident alone .. piling up will help no one.. you're reacting to this incident on the basis of his reaction to other incidents as well whereas he's not doing that.. FWIW he probably doesn't know that's what you're doing either.. \n\nI am in no way justifying what your partner is doing .. just giving you a different perspective.. I'm already dreading the downvotes and \"you don't like women\" comments..", ">It was immature but definitely not wrong.\n\nThat was my point too.. but then again I'm someone who always tell people in a relationship to be confident in themselves, their partner and their relationship.. confident enough to give negative comments and take some when it comes.. there's really no \"I'm always positive and nice 100% of the time\" people out there.. if there are things you EXPLICITLY don't want said or done communicate that before your partner says or does it unknowningly.. like give them a chance to be better.. but maybe that's just me .. \n\nIf you're actively tip-toeing around in your relationship then don't be in one.. that's about it..", "Well, I guess this is illustrating very clearly that he has no intention of changing.", "Sounds like me about 4 years ago, and that was with undiagnosed BPD. \n\nI was emotionally manipulative and wasn\u2019t aware of it. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and it felt like there was someone else piloting my body. My conscious was locked away and I had to go back and find her again. I\u2019ve been through lots of therapies and finally have a good fit for my personal therapist, but I\u2019m also in a program called DBT. Dialectal behavior therapy, and it\u2019s a group therapy, I have a huge binder for it, and I\u2019ve been learning and using the skills in it. \n\nBut my point is that it\u2019s a lot of work and time and effort to get out of a trauma or mindset like his. When someone is at the point of shut down only after you didn\u2019t want to show the video anymore, that\u2019s gonna need a lot of introspection. It might take less time than it did for me, but he needs to want it. He needs to accept that that\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna take for healthy communication and boundaries and mutual respect. \n\n\n\nI\u2019d also like to say that it might be a better idea, for now, to wait for your anger to pass, offer him some kindness unrelated to the situation (maybe make him some tea or coffee or whatever he likes to eat drink or snack on, tell him you love him, kiss on the cheek, and walk away. He probably needs that space for now, but you should remind him that you care about him, but I\u2019d be short with it.

Which is the only reason I went with ESH", "Lol I don\u2019t have too much ego. That\u2019s an interesting take though. But y\u2019all are wild in this thread \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Like you honestly can\u2019t understand why I would be upset when I was so excited to show him something I was really proud of and the first things out of his mouth is negative??? Weird.", "Okay, as I admitted in other comments, I may have over reacted a bit. I\u2019m very sensitive when it comes to my art and the thing is HE KNOWS THAT. And I don\u2019t know why you both think it\u2019s so weird of me to expect nice things to come out of my partners mouth when I\u2019m showing him something  that means alot to me\u2026 \n\nI never ignored him. I just stopped playing the video. I immediately told him why that upset me in a calm manner and that was treated with hostility and silence. I again tried to break that and discuss it with him a few minutes later, but to no avail. He ignored me for a total of three hours for nothing. He hurt MY feeling I didn\u2019t do shit to hurt his. If anything I did him a favor by stopping the video, I mean like ya\u2019ll said it\u2019s sore to the ears when someone is off tempo so what\u2019s the point in continuing to watch it? Lol\n\n\n\n\nI dont need your critiques on music. I\u2019ve been a music/singer/songwriter for almost two decades now, and did it professionally for a decade. \nI\u2019m good thanks.", "We understand you're proud of your work and expected your partner to do better.. we just don't agree with your reaction.. \n\n>something I was really proud of\n\nFor someone who takes pride in their skills, it's baffling to see how you managed to go off tempo right from the beginning.. tempo going off literally ruins the whole music and you being someone who is trained in the same should know it.. why are you surprised your boyfriend pointed out the most basic thing and why did you decide to make a big deal out of it instead of just telling him you have since improved..?", "its not negative. Its a comment. And you should be happy that your bf is honest with you not a fake pleaser", "You make it easy to understand that you are self-conscious so we know exactly why you're upset. It's weird how you can't understand that the smallest bit of criticism isn't something to get upset about. He didn't lash out and say it was terrible or anything of the sort but just made an objective statement of being off tempo and you over reacted due to being self-conscious.", "Definitely NTA; I'm a musician, so I might have a different point of view. I think in general when you have feedback like this you should watch the video, say something positive, then give the critical feedback. Personally people can skip the positive part for me, but I've also killed my imposter syndrome.\n\nNot to dig into fresh wounds, but timing is really the most important part of music. You're better off playing the wrong notes in time than the right notes out of time. Personally, I HATE the tick of a metronome, so I really played out of time because of it. What really helped me get rock solid is playing and recording myself over drums and other backing tracks.\n\nWith how long you've been playing I'm sure you're in the spot I was. Skill level of an advanced player, timing of a beginner, so you're intermediate. Really work on that timing for 3-6 months in the way I mentioned, and you'll suddenly wake up one day and realize you're an advanced player. My DMs are open if you want specific advice.", "Why are people so sensitive these days? If I'm honest you both sound emotionally immature. You can't take criticism and react to it like a spoiled brat and he sounds equally as awful if not more so. I'd expect this kinda thing from a couple of teenagers. By that I mean early teens too. Like 13 or 14. How the hell are either of you going to react to real crises in life? Give your heads a wobble.", "NTA!\n\nDude insults you and gets upset and acts like a child... why are you still dating him?", "NTA\n\nHe insulted you, and then had a hissy fit and put on the silent treatment because you got upset with him?!\n\nWhy are you with him if he does this sort of thing often like you say?\n\nHe sounds like he's a man sized toddler.  If you want kids in your future how on earth is it going to work with a partner who behaves like this?!", "What did he expect would happen when the first words out of his mouth were criticism?  And the temper tantrum when you refused to continue?  I expect this is often the case with him. Are you sure you want to go down this road for the long haul?  \n\nI\u2019m like you - I don\u2019t need to be lavished with praise, but don\u2019t start ripping what you asked to see five seconds in. \n\nNTA", "post it, I'd like to watch it.", "You\u2019re both babies. ESH", "His tantrum is sooooo unattractive", "NTA\n\nBut with a catch. You're an AH to yourself for staying with that joke of a man.\nHe's barely a 5 yo. He humiliates you, sulks, and you humiliate yourself even further by apologizing for pretending to stand for yourself.\n\nAnd yes, I said pretending to. Because by apologizing, you're actually being a carpet and standing for nothing but his ego.\n\nTake a real stand for self-respect and kick that jerk out of your life.", "NTA\n\nIs this how you want to live the rest of your life?", "Nta girl get out. He insulted you and he is upset you\u2019re hurt? Nahhhhh it isn\u2019t worth it.", "He has his back turned towards you for 25 mins and he's sulking? Are you sure he's not your pre-teen son?\n\nGirl, I don't know your situation but what you wrote, tells me that you'll end up being his mom and not his partner. Be ready for that or leave.\n\nNTA. Like, at all.", "NTA You know who behaves like this re the anger, right? Bullies, narcissists, abusive AHs etc.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, your boyfriend would have apologised for upsetting you. He would have listened to your perspective.  This would have been sorted an hour ago.", "NTA. My 14 year old wouldn't do that. It's manipulative, and exactly the sort of thing that longer term, is or will become mentally abusive.\n\nGo find someone else who appreciates your piano playing.", "You two are dramatic AF. He hurt your feelings by telling you the truth? Maybe you are too sensitive to show people. I get it your are proud of your skills but that doesn\u2019t means everyone has to. You where off tempo sooooo what??? You know that cause you said you are sensitive about people mentioning it. Sooo you have been told before the your are off tempo. Maybe practice and get better or get a better attitude or stop bragging about your skills when you aren\u2019t as good as you make yourself to be.", "OP, you sound like you're pretty invested in this relationship, but it's become toxic. Is there any way you could propose doing some couples therapy? Perhaps booking some therapy for you and ask him to come along for moral support?", "NTA. This guy sounds like a real keeper\u2026\n\n(Seriously though he seems like a massive dick).", "He is behaving like this so that next time he insults you, you will feel bad about reacting to it and you will let his bad behaviour slip.\n\nNTA, he is emotionally manipulating you.", "My partner bought a   flute and stated playing it again along with  music that we were listening to and I kept my mouth shut when he was off tempo or didn't hit a particular note because I care about him and I know he's just learning. This is an excellent example of emotional manipulation. You're NTA but he is and I'd rethink the relationship especially when he's resorted to the silent treatment to punish you. NTA", "It\u2019s over - he sounds like a narcissist manipulating you and gaslighting. Break free and live your life - it\u2019s never too late! You can\u2019t change him so give that up.", "NTA dump him please.", "NTA he sounds exhausting. \n\n\"You're off-tempo\" also sounds exactly like what someone who knows nothing about music would say", "Girl, find a dude whose first reaction to you showing him a video of you playing the piano is to proudly look at you and then insists on showing other people. \n\nThis child that you have who is taking your joy needs to go find less.\n\nNTA", "NTA He's dismissing you and the things you love, then he's making you feel guilty for reacting and protecting your feelings.

That's not salvation.", "I'm sure your debt is paid!!! You do not owe him the rest of your life. It sounds like you guys have saved each other at some point so the scores even! I would loudly state that grown adults who utilize the silent treatment are manipulators", "Hey OP, just hopping on this one because i hope you see this.\n\nThe silent treatment is as others here have said, a form of emotional abuse.

I have had a pretty shitty life and he was the only person that I felt like enjoyed listening to me talk. Once I finally started feeling like a human being again and I started working towards concrete goals he stopped caring about me. Sometimes people want to feel like someone\u2019s savior and get bored when you get better. People are in your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime. He had his reason and his season, but he is not a lifetime person.

The piano critique/incredible sulk is trivial in comparison to the rest of the issues. Go and speak to a DV shelter - get their advice.
