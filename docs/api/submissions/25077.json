I thought I had showed him them before (for context we\u2019ve been together for just about a year and a half), but he said I never did. I was pretty excited as I\u2019m very proud of my piano skills. I took lessons from 6-16 then completely stopped playing for like 12 years and when I picked it back up at 28 I was somehow better than I had ever been when I took lessons, I think it\u2019s because I was finally passionate about it. \n\nAnyway, he seemed pretty excited to watch the videos and I was equally excited to share. So I find the first video to show him (it\u2019s me playing and singing \u201cStay\u201d by Rihanna), he says \u201coh I know that song!\u201d I hit play and the first words out of his mouth? \u201cYou\u2019re off tempo\u201d \n\u2026\nNow, I\u2019m proud of my piano skills, but I\u2019m not delusional, I\u2019m of intermediate skill level, and I need a TON of practice.

So for something negative to be the first thing out of his mouth, and about my tempo no less, hurt me. So I immediately shut down and quickly turned the video off and said \u201cNever mind\u201d. He told me to turn it back on and I said \u201cno, maybe some other time\u201d and he again insisted I just put my phone away and said \u201cno it\u2019s okay\u201d.

I think this is a pretty good example, or am I wrong??\n\nEDIT #2: It\u2019s been over an hour and he is STILL completely ignoring me.

Overall, not a major deal though and I would have thought he would just take on board that you didn\u2019t particularly want criticism in these situations and that would be it.   \n\n\nWhat I find more concerning than either his insensitive comment or your slight overreaction is that he is now sitting you out and putting you in a position to console him. Particularly given that this seems to be a pattern of behaviour for him, this would be a major red flag for me (done that, got the t-shirt, what not).

Maybe if you are so afraid of being criticized you should tell people you are off tempo before showing them the video so you don't get your feelings hurt.\n\nAs for your bf, his reaction is pretty immature.

Oh he wanted me out because he felt like he\u2019d done everything in his power to help me get help(therapy) and get a job but I hadn\u2019t in the year we\u2019ve been together so he felt like pushing me out of the nest (so to speak) would be the best way to make me step up.", "You\u2019re right.

Someone who was right for you in one phase of your life (in crisis, in this example) is not necessarily the person who will be right for you long term. Whilst it feels skeezy on the surface, maintaining a relationship because of a sense of obligation is not healthy for anyone long term. \n\nYou can talk to him, express, clearly and without blame (using 'I' statements helps this) how you feel and what you want to see improve,  you can settle for this and accept that he's unlikely to change without prompt (and possibly even with it), or you can leave, but for fuck sake, don't make any of those choices based on a misplaced sense of obligation based on history and trauma: those are not good decision making aides!!", "That was a relationship based on you being crazed and out it.

Doesn't mean he's justified, but also you're putting yourself in that position and expecting him to change ... He's keeping the both of you afloat and helping you survive, he probably thinks you should cut him some slack in his lack of emotional maturity.. \n\nOr he is not partner material and can't see you for being your own person and counts you as an extension of him since he's the one providing.. \n\nI commented on your post that this was an ESH situation.. this comment of yours only further solidifies that judgement and tilting it towards a soft YTA. Because as much as you cry emotional manipulation, we don't know anything of how far your partner goes to provide for both of you and what he has to put up with. \n\nIf your only reason to stay with him is the fact that he provides, then you're no good partner either.", ">a critique wouldn\u2019t be the first thing out of my mouth. \n\nThat doesn't mean everyone else has to be that way. I'm a person who has like 0 creativity. So I don't understand things like paintings, music, movies etc etc. And I always 100% find fault with these kind of works (my tastes are different).. but everyone around me knows this is exactly who I am.. they know I'd always encourage them to excel in whatever they like, but it wouldn't be in a manner they want. So if they wanna hear \"OMG your music is the best\" there's no point in coming to me.. I wouldn't be able to say that.. but if they want someone to come watch their performance and cheer them on I'd be there.. if they wanted someone to stay up late nights with them for their practice session and just make coffee, I would.. but I can see myself saying something like your bf did.. not exactly as a critique but because IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE and if that's the first thing that jumps at you from a music video the first impression is already bad.. and as an adult the general assumption is you're mature enough to take negative comments.. \n\n>he still won\u2019t speak to me\n\nSo I don't know how your relationship works, but with mine it's kinda established that the person who caused the problem should make the first step in mending things even if the other partner is partly at fault. In this particular scenario (even my previous comment was on that alone) you seemed to have caused the rift. Your bf didn't know about it being a sensitive topic and instead of telling him that you shut down without explaining why.. so you started ignoring him first .. you can't expect him to take accountability for no fault of his own (combining this incident to all others in your relationship is a different matter I cannot comment on).. \n\n>He wants me to grovel and ask for forgiveness\n\nDon't do that.. but in this instance be the person to reach out and start the conversation to solve this.. and try and keep the conversation to this incident alone .. piling up will help no one.. you're reacting to this incident on the basis of his reaction to other incidents as well whereas he's not doing that.. FWIW he probably doesn't know that's what you're doing either.. \n\nI am in no way justifying what your partner is doing .. just giving you a different perspective.. I'm already dreading the downvotes and \"you don't like women\" comments..", ">It was immature but definitely not wrong.\n\nThat was my point too.. but then again I'm someone who always tell people in a relationship to be confident in themselves, their partner and their relationship.. confident enough to give negative comments and take some when it comes.. there's really no \"I'm always positive and nice 100% of the time\" people out there.. if there are things you EXPLICITLY don't want said or done communicate that before your partner says or does it unknowningly.. like give them a chance to be better.. but maybe that's just me .. \n\nIf you're actively tip-toeing around in your relationship then don't be in one.. that's about it..", "Well, I guess this is illustrating very clearly that he has no intention of changing.", "Sounds like me about 4 years ago, and that was with undiagnosed BPD. \n\nI was emotionally manipulative and wasn\u2019t aware of it. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and it felt like there was someone else piloting my body. My conscious was locked away and I had to go back and find her again. I\u2019ve been through lots of therapies and finally have a good fit for my personal therapist, but I\u2019m also in a program called DBT. Dialectal behavior therapy, and it\u2019s a group therapy, I have a huge binder for it, and I\u2019ve been learning and using the skills in it. \n\nBut my point is that it\u2019s a lot of work and time and effort to get out of a trauma or mindset like his. When someone is at the point of shut down only after you didn\u2019t want to show the video anymore, that\u2019s gonna need a lot of introspection. It might take less time than it did for me, but he needs to want it. He needs to accept that that\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna take for healthy communication and boundaries and mutual respect. \n\n\n\nI\u2019d also like to say that it might be a better idea, for now, to wait for your anger to pass, offer him some kindness unrelated to the situation (maybe make him some tea or coffee or whatever he likes to eat drink or snack on, tell him you love him, kiss on the cheek, and walk away. He probably needs that space for now, but you should remind him that you care about him, but I\u2019d be short with it.

Which is the only reason I went with ESH", "Lol I don\u2019t have too much ego. That\u2019s an interesting take though. But y\u2019all are wild in this thread \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Like you honestly can\u2019t understand why I would be upset when I was so excited to show him something I was really proud of and the first things out of his mouth is negative??? Weird.", "Okay, as I admitted in other comments, I may have over reacted a bit. I\u2019m very sensitive when it comes to my art and the thing is HE KNOWS THAT. And I don\u2019t know why you both think it\u2019s so weird of me to expect nice things to come out of my partners mouth when I\u2019m showing him something  that means alot to me\u2026 \n\nI never ignored him. I just stopped playing the video. I immediately told him why that upset me in a calm manner and that was treated with hostility and silence. I again tried to break that and discuss it with him a few minutes later, but to no avail. He ignored me for a total of three hours for nothing. He hurt MY feeling I didn\u2019t do shit to hurt his. If anything I did him a favor by stopping the video, I mean like ya\u2019ll said it\u2019s sore to the ears when someone is off tempo so what\u2019s the point in continuing to watch it? Lol\n\n\n\n\nI dont need your critiques on music. I\u2019ve been a music/singer/songwriter for almost two decades now, and did it professionally for a decade. \nI\u2019m good thanks.", "We understand you're proud of your work and expected your partner to do better.. we just don't agree with your reaction.. \n\n>something I was really proud of\n\nFor someone who takes pride in their skills, it's baffling to see how you managed to go off tempo right from the beginning.. tempo going off literally ruins the whole music and you being someone who is trained in the same should know it.. why are you surprised your boyfriend pointed out the most basic thing and why did you decide to make a big deal out of it instead of just telling him you have since improved..?", "its not negative. Its a comment. And you should be happy that your bf is honest with you not a fake pleaser", "You make it easy to understand that you are self-conscious so we know exactly why you're upset. It's weird how you can't understand that the smallest bit of criticism isn't something to get upset about. He didn't lash out and say it was terrible or anything of the sort but just made an objective statement of being off tempo and you over reacted due to being self-conscious."]}
