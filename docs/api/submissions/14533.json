And just like anyone else, I get so bored when I'm home alone. But I am an avid horror movie fan and I decided that I should spend my time catching up on a few of the films on my Netflix playlist to pass the time. Yesterday I started watching Fear Street.\n\nIn order to understand, you need a bit of background. The way my house is laid out, there is a large window that means that anyone walking by on the street can see anything that is being played on the TV and I hate that it's laid out like that because it makes me feel like I get absolutely no privacy. \n\nWith that in mind, yesterday I was watching a horror film with the curtains open which means that anyone walking by could technically peer in and see what I was watching. I was chilled and frankly having a lot of fun cause it's a good film- not too gory or cliche. It was more sexual in my opinion. I hadn't realised but a couple of kids playing on the street were passing by and clearly they had peered in during a bloody scene because an old woman had knocked on the window and when I looked back at her she pointed to my TV, then at me and then at my door.\n\nI think my first mistake was just shrugging and drawing the curtains because at the time I had no clue her kids had seen what was on the TV and I assumed she was mad about- something or other. At some point the knocking against my window stopped and I thought nothing of it.\n\nBut then, this morning I woke up to the doorbell ringing and my mum, who was about to leave for work, answered it. Whoever was at the door spoke to her for maybe ten minutes and then she came upstairs, shook me awake and told me to go downstairs and talk to the person at the door. Turns out it was the woman, arms crossed, with two little boys stood behind her. I don't remember what she was yelling entirely, but, to paraphrase, she was annoyed that I was watching such a film with the curtains open and her children fully able to see it as they ran by. \n\nSee, here's my dilemma. Because as she yelled at me I tried to tell her I was sorry her kids saw what I was watching, but I was watching what I wanted in my own house and I did not feel it was my issue that her children had stopped and must have physically looked at what I was watching because if they had been just running by, they would not have been able to clearly see the scene. But she did not listen and instead kept reprimanding me, calling me careless and disgusting. \n\nShe left and my mum and I stared at each other with confused faces. My mum is on my side, thinking that looking inside our house is a privacy violation, but I'm not so sure. I've started drawing the curtains when I'm downstairs and watching anything that isn't rated U, but I don't know if I was in the wrong. AITA for not drawing my curtains in the first place?\n\nA couple of edits based on frequent questions/comments:\n- My TV is quite far away from the window so someone passing by at normal walking speed would only be able to make out colours, shapes, faces and some subtitles that I need, so in order to get a good, high res look you'd need to stand on my front garden (which is covered in pebbles so I'd be able to hear someone walking). I have no clue how the kids got a good look without standing on the rocks\n- In my opinion my mum had woken me up to get a better recount since perhaps the woman's account was not accurate or didn't sound like something I'd do, I have no clue \n- The film had 2 sex scenes at the start- saying that it was more sexual than gory is because there was hardly any gore in it, just more spooky- my apologies for that, I should've made it 10x clearer\n- I would've watched the film in the dark if it weren't for my hatred of the dark and terror of being home alone haha\n- I was watching the second Fear Street (1978), not the one with the bread slicer and I was only half way through it, maybe 40 minutes or so\n\nEdit 2: I do have one gripe and I'm gonna ask this politely for you not to talk badly about my mother as I don't have an issue with her and I am not asking whether she is the asshole in this situation. She was just confused and wanted to get more info and based on what she told me I don't believe the lady even told her what she was there for, just asked for her to go get me because it was an emergency. As for \"standing there while the woman berated me\", my mother knows I can handle my own battles unless they become physical or hostile and if things got very bad she would have jumped in. So I ask kindly for no discussions on my mother and whether she was an asshole or not; that is not what the post is about.

Your workspace needs to be immaculate. The film cover is removed. Any granual of dirt or stray hair will stick and ruin the film If it gets on it during installation.\n\nOnce it is up. You have to work it forever to get the bubbles and excess water out. Careful what you use for smoothing. A plastic squeegee will scratch it. I wrapped my squeegee with a cloth.\n\nOnce all is said and done. They look great and give excellent privacy during the day. The rooms a bit darker. But it's not bad. It's worth it to look outside without anyone looking in. I went with a blue tint interior side.", "Thank you for the very comprehensive response! I've just installed some of that frosted-effect film in my kitchen, which was dead easy and looks great, but it sounds like the one-way stuff is less forgiving.", "Not to mention that specific flag is deemed political speech, so any obscenity speech law wouldn't stand up to the 1st amendment.", "From my own experience having these in an old office that was all windows, they are also not bird friendly. We had a couple of birds that would peck at it all day long because they mistook their own reflection for a rival/enemy.", "You probably don't see defects as much in something that is opaque. On this stuff bubbles are glaringly obvious.", "Ah, I would never have even considered that. Thank you!", "Makes sense.", "NTA", "Not in the United States.\nAt least not looking in an open window from the public sidewalk.\nWalking into private property and peering into a window would be but simply looking in a window with curtains open, as in this case, is not illegal.", "No fucking way that's a criminal offense. Looking through someone's window from the street is illegal?", "no it isn't\n\nyou can sit on the street and watch whatever windows you want", "Lol no it isn\u2019t.", "It's illegal to see things with your eyes? Are you telling me you can guarantee your eyes will never catch of glimpse of something going on behind someones window? Depending on the layout of the street it could be impossible to avoid seeing into OPs window unless one were to intentionally turn their head or look to the ground or something. \n\nThere is a BIG difference between going onto someones property in order to catch a glimpse into someones window, and just.... using your eyes and seeing things that are visible from the street.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if you watched the movie on full blast with the windows open. That mother should teach her children not to peer into people\u2019s windows. That\u2019s creepy.", "So in order to get a good look at the movie the two boys would have had to come onto your property? But the mother was more concerned with what you were watching than the fact that her children broke the law by trespassing...\n\nSMH", "As always, if you don't like, there's a simple and foolproof way to stop seeing it.\n\nDon't look.", "Thankfully not here in the state where I am!", "In most places it is 100% legal to be naked in your own home. \n\nMasturbating at the window looking at children? Problem. \n\nWandering around your house naked with no clothes on and curtains open. Not a problem.", "This is a thing?! People have been put on sex offender lists for being naked in their own homes??", "Definitely! Nobody would've been talking to my son at 15 like that without coming through me. And, it definitely wouldn't have been yelling. \n\nOP did nothing wrong by watching the movie in the living room with the curtains and blinds open. It was the responsibility of the parent to teach the kids to respect privacy.", "Theres definitely a weird subset at least of people on AITA that want to make everything they dislike into something 100x worse than it is.", "She walked right up to OPs window, looked in at him, and knocked on it to talk to him. She's absolutely a peeping Tom herself.", "Time to introduce nosy kids to some Faces of Death \ud83d\ude0f", "OP said that in order to clearly see what was on the TV they would have to be standing on her landscaping rocks. I'd say that's putting in effort to see in someone's house.", "Literally played saw movies on a projector on the front lawn a couple years ago.  The neighbors loved it.  People went home and got chairs and snacks and came back.  It was supposed to be part of the whole haunted house thing; turned into an impromptu block party.", "How about Human Centipede?  Really give them some nightmares.", "The world needs more people like you", "I thought about it, but only wanna scar them, not give them PTSD.", "I now get messages on Nextdoor with suggestions.  Last year we did all the black and white classics like Frankenstein, Dracula and such.  This year we\u2019re planning a couple nights over the weekend with a playlist similar to drive-ins of old.  Kiddie movie early; more mature movie later.", "NTA but your mom is. TF is she thinking waking you up and not addressing the situation herself? I wish someone would come for mine.", "How does this comment have so many upvotes?", "Same here. I live in an apartment and I will actually switch TO some of my favorite horror movies, or interesting music, when the children playing outside get too close to our unit. Drowns out the noise and if any parents complain, I can point out the education their children received would not have happened had they not looked in my windows.  So far no complaints.  \n\n\nNTA OP. Also, keep on with the horror movies. 'Fear Street' was a pretty good trilogy. I'm not sure what country you are in, but if you have access to the free streaming service Tubi, there are a lot of horror movies on there. The quality varies, but you might find some you like.", "Totally agree.  As the mom of a 15 year old son, I would not have brought him to the door. No busybody is going to yell at my kid in his own home!\n\nOP, you're NTA.  You are allowed to enjoy entertainment in your own home without harassment. Enjoy the rest of your spring holiday with as many horror films as your heart desires.", "Agreed. This is a behavior that should be curbed before it actually turns into a serious issue, but it's also an entirely understandable behavior from children, who tend to be curious and not entirely up to snuff with how the social contract works. Some kids being genuine little fuckanapes doesn't mean we should treat every kid who does something wrong, particularly if the wrong in question is fairly harmless, as if they're monstrous little criminals.", "The best way to become a writer is to live enough and to write. It looks like you're doing both already!", "Haha yeah! I've been working on a novel recently, it's not any good but it's a fun pastime, along with annoying mothers", "human centipede 1 and 2", "A Serbian Film and Salo on loop", "if you're going for trauma look no further than \"A Serbian Film\" (P.S. If you respect yourself I don't recommend reading the synopsis. It's beyond fucked up)", "Man some of you guys really want to give kids PTSD I just wanna scar them a little.", "disclaimer: def don't do actually that, that'd be messed up\n\nmaybe just a little Terrifier for the tykes", "I hope this isn't creepy but I wish I was friends with you."]}
