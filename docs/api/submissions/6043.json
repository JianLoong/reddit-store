As an American who is used to it varying by family my only upset would be if it was something I was allergic to and they didn\u2019t attempt to make some type of accommodation for me to eat something/anything filling for the meal. Even if it were just a bunch of yummy sides. I simply don\u2019t expect my traditions to be imposed on other peoples households.", "I don't think he's a friend you want to keep.", "Miss Manners would have words for AH and his family.\n\nAbsolutely rude and entitled of them.", "Bacalhau is fucking delicious. I've never had a turkey that would beat it. \n\nI suppose I've never served it to picky eaters, but the way I've been taught to make it anyway, I've never found anyone who didn't like it.\n\nI'm sure it was great. Guy missed out.", "One version I like is \n\n\"Don't let the door hit ya where the Good L-rd split ya!\" (i.e. buttocks)", "Ha!  Take it away! Just don't get too squicked out from using it lol", "Take care and go do something nice for yourself to forget about this ugliness.", "We are of Italian descent, and we always had Cod on Christmas Eve. I never liked it, but we always had to take a bite. But I would never leave someone\u2019s home and complain. If they serve some thing, I didn\u2019t like on Christmas Eve? Especially if I have shown up with no warning.", ">They sound like a MAGA family.\n\nMakes sense. Who else would insist on \"Good Old American Christmas Traditions\" (whatever those are) while being a fucking guest in a fucking foreign country?\n\nThe nerve of it!", "THEY were also not invited.  Only A was.  WTF bringing 2 people to stay for MULTIPLE DAYS in someone less home???", "Thank you! I work retail so it\u2019ll definitely be given frequent outings\u2026. beautiful!", "\"Make America Great Again\"\n\nJingo bombast from Trump and his ilk.", "Sorry about that then! I haven't actually ever heard it before so that's my bad.", "Like....a sneaky surprise bumhug? There is a time when a child can make it seem natural (when they at about bum-height), but it might get tricky as an adult. Hug them as they are passing by perhaps? Hard at home, easy at cinema/theatre etc.", "Thank you! I should\u2019ve known that. I AM an idiot \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f also no idea why the font has changed to this one. Clearly I should stick to lurking\ud83d\ude33", "Just a play on words. Unless you are my nieces/nephews\u2026 apparently now it means \u2018fart in your face\u2019\u2026. reason I don\u2019t have kids #907 \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
