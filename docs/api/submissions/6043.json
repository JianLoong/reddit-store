You offered a traditional Portuguese meal as a kind gesture to your friend's family, and the father became angry and insulted you and your country.

Different cultures celebrate Christmas with different meals & instead of them embracing your traditional holiday while in your country they demanded you make them their traditional meal as if they'd never left home? No wonder people hate Americans; that's the most outlandish slap in the face insinuating the American way is the only way to celebrate a holiday. NTA & I'm American.

The man was rude. If I showed up at someone house uninvited; or even invited; I wouldn't complain about the food. I would kept my thoughts to myself and eat what I like of the meal. It may not be everything, but I wouldn't disrespect someone over a meal they prepared for me to eat. I understand how hard it can be cooking a holiday meal for family and friends.

You were wonderful to welcome the unexpected parents!", "Even in the US people have different meal traditions, not everyone has turkey.  My wife's family is of Lebanese decent and has a pretty Lebanese influenced Christmas meal. The food is amazing and I prefer it over turkey. Hell the only reason mashed potatoes are included at the holiday meals is because they are being nice and accommodating us white boys that married into the family. \nNTA op, sorry you had to deal with some ugly Americans that make the rest of us look bad.", "Atlantic cod sounds so much better than turkey to me.
