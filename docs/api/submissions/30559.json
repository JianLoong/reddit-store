Logic would dictate she should have saved up for it herself, she wouldn't even need to ask if she were more responsable with her own money. Sure the allowance thing is kind of cringe but so is someone throwing a fit because they cant manage their own money correctly.  And how is it degrading for her to ask her own husband for money?  As someone who has had to ask for money from my SO when I was abruptly unemployed i felt no shame because I knew we are in love and I will pay it back. If she didn't want to be in a relationship she should have stayed single.  But now she is in a partnership and trying to bleed her companion for a dress that he explained he cant afford then throws a tantrum because she feels the dress is a need somehow.  It seems OP is fine with taking on more financial responsibility than her within reason. An expensive dress for one night is not reasonable unless you marry a millionaire, which he does not seem to be.  She needs to manage her expectations or find her own means of getting the things she wants or find someone who can buy her pointlessly expensive things to keep her happy.

Or what do you think happens if you just take the small first step of stopping the allowance?  She\u2019s already tossing around false accusations in order to shame you into compliance, so what else is in store?  Would the false accusations get worse?  Would she physically abuse you?  Leave you?  Cheat?  Like what exactly do you think you\u2019re \u201cbuying\u201d by enabling such a needlessly lopsided arrangement, and why do you think that\u2019s acceptable?  Why does she?
