Begrudgingly, she agreed.\n\nFast forward a few months, and she wants an expensive dress that I can barely afford for an upcoming family event. This is less than a month after I told her that I am having cash flow issues and we need to save up *again*. I ask her to buy it herself, reminding her I have been paying her even more for her monthly allowance in the past few months compared to the amount we had agreed on. I also remind her the reason I have been doing this is because she asked for it *herself* to be able to buy *this dress*. I tell her it is unfair.

I find her response to your talk very concerning.  This is not the behavior of a mature adult.   I wouldn't exactly call her a gold digger, but she's not on the same financial page as you are.

This will vary by income, but just for kicks, let's say the discetionary budget is $1000, which you split 50/50.  Now lets say she wants a  dress that is $800.   She can save up her discretionary budget until she has enough to purchase the dress, but she can't dip into other budgets.   \n\nI would say the wife is definitely TAH, and OP a smidge for calling the money he gives his wife an \"allowance\".", "This.
