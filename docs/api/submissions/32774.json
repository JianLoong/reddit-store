However, his parents, his grandmother, and two brothers are involved. His one brother is married to a woman named \"Karen\", and they have two kids, both elementary school aged. \n\nKaren approached me about us having our kids photographed together and framed as gifts for the children's grandparents. The deal was she would pay for the sitting, and I would pay for the printing and framing once we decided on the photos. I told her I would consult with her on the frames, sizing, type before purchasing.  I also had some separate photos taken of my child for Xmas cards, which I paid for separately. \n\nThe photos come back, and she asked me to let her know which ones I like. I tell her I will review the following day and get back to her.  Lo and behold she just selects the photos without my input and tells the photographer to begin editing. \n\nI was taken aback when one of the photos she selected was objectively horrible (although her kids looked great in it). My kids mouth was open, with a cookie visibly half eaten inside said mouth, and her skirt slightly hiked up revealing a droopy diaper visible under her tights.\n\nWhen she showed me the selections, I figured I would gently break it to her that I did not want to use said photo for the gift at the time I would be orchestrating printing and framing. I had also purchased another lovely group photo (where all kids looked objectively great in)  that she didn't select. I figured I would suggest this one at that time. \n\nA few days later, she tells me she ordered some sort of textile thing and paid for it all already. I was not pleased as this was supposed to be my portion of the gift, but didn't say anything as it was already a done deal. \n\nShe texts me a photo yesterday of three 8x11 pictures of the kids in ugly basic black frames. She said she spent $200.00 on these special frames, which are basically just sticky on the back or something. The pictures cannot be removed. I hate the gift, and the fact that she unilaterally incurred $200.00 for it - which was my financial responsibility - was equally upsetting. \n\nShe offered to pay for it or go half on the framing. I said I still want to contribute financially. She said something to the effect that I could frame the group photo I had purchased. I then said that they really don't need four 8x11's of variations on the same photo. I then said that the gift was not what I envisioned (I wanted to do a montage), and I wish we would have communicated more in this.\n\n Then I get a notification via Evite that she and her kids and husband are no longer attending my child's birthday party later this month. I'm immediately blocked on Facebook and her cell. I call her from my office line and she is taken aback. Says something to the effect that she is the wrong person to cop an attitude with. I believe she then hangs up on me but can't tell because the toddler began whining in the background.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She sounds like a jealous person, and frankly, neither you nor your daughter need that negative influence in your lives. You\u2019ll likely find that she did you a favor by blocking you and choosing not to come to the party. NTA"]}
