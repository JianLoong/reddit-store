There were several families who brought children, various parents took turns watching so no one had to miss everything.  There is no indication that anyone had to miss the actual wedding--it may amaze some of you, but hotels in places like that frequently have babysitting services that could have been employed during the main event.  Quit acting as if the mother of the bride had to miss the entire wedding to sit with the kids!

Now, if 1 or 2 parents agreed to miss the entire ceremony so that they could watch all the kids, that's fine and not being an AH. Just don't interrupt the ceremony trying to switch shifts.", "I'm not confused, I understand perfectly what we are judging, and OP is still NTA.\n\nSIL is entitled to have a child free wedding, and she got a child free wedding because no children were present at any of the festivities. That's what the guests agreed to and that is what happened. \n\nThe entire family sacrificed their time and money to be there for the event, and they are also entitled to want to take advantage of the remaining time of the trip to get a vacation out of it. And yes, people with children include their kids in their vacations, they can't just leave them home alone.", "How did it impact the wedding?  We\u2019re the kids there?  Did it mess with the brides\u201dvision\u201d?  No.  Op found a way to go to the wedding child free and still be with her kids in a beautiful place.  It\u2019s a win win.  Except for the narcissist bride.", "Oh, and when I said \"at least half the parents would decline\", I meant that one parent in a couple would attend, while the other would stay home. It doesn't seem so unlikely.", "You seem to be projecting YOUR values onto SIL's. You seem so sure that her desire for a child-free wedding was rooted in wanting her guests to be completely free to focus entirely on her wedding as much as not wanting loud, annoying kids around. That's not everyone's train of thought.\n\nMy argument is rooted in practicality and experience, call it anecdotal if you wish, but to me it's common sense. If you're having a destination wedding, it's unreasonable to expect all the guests to be focused entirely on you for the entire trip (maybe your bridal party). Even childless single people are going to want to be off doing their own thing at some point.\n\nYou get one day where your preferences reign supreme, SIL apparently got several events. It doesn't affect her if some of her guests were doing family activities in their free time. She asked for a child-free wedding, she got it. \n\nAs for your belief that she was upset that not everyone was there at every event all the time at the same time... That's just not a practical expectation. Everyone steps out during a wedding celebration, everyone. People step out to use the bathroom, have a smoke, hang out in the lobby to take a breather, hook up in the coat room, inject their insulin. Someone always misses the first dance or the cake cutting. It's expected and not a big deal.\n\nI don't know, according to your logic, it sounds like it would have been more acceptable for either OP or her husband to RSVP no, while the other RSVPd yes, and they both went to Hawaii with their kids, but one of them attended the wedding events while the other kept completely away and did things with the kids. How is that better? They're on the same island, but OP doesn't even see her SIL because she's with her kids, and SIL would, according to you, prefer for OP to not be there at all rather than be there and have to occasionally step away to watch her kids? So OP should just ignore SIL and her wedding, even though she's right there? That sounds so convoluted.\n\nMaybe I am basing this on my preferences, but frankly so are you. I would prefer to have a wedding where more people could make it, even if they occasionally have to step away (which, again, happens at every wedding, child-free or not). You seem to think guests should be present and involved the whole time, or not show up at all. I don't know, my wedding was small, and I have no idea who was there when.\n\nAnyways, I doubt I'll change your mind, and that's OK.  Have a good day / evening.", "multiple people brought their kids, guests that would have left would be guests that also have kids to watch.", "It says right in her post parents took turns babysitting", "Finding out if those people offered to help would be useful in determining AH/NTA status, also.", "We're they AT the wedding? No. \nDid the bride reserve the entire state? No. Of course not.", "That\u2019s my thought too. Like unless SIL is completely unhinged, which I guess is possible, it\u2019s more likely that she was upset other people had to be wrangled into caring for the children and missed or changed events as a result.", "Lol not really. I\u2019m more likely to assume that if SIL used the phrase \u201cno one cared about her wedding day\u201d then something specific happened that made her feel that way. If the kids being there didn\u2019t impact any of her events at all, there would be no reason to say that.", "No.\n\n> *\"And yes, people with children include their kids in their vacations, they can't just leave them home alone\"*\n\nThat's a false dichotomy.  Your other option is to stay at home.\n\nThe kids not only impacted OP's family, but ***OTHER FAMILIES*** as well, because \"some parents took turns babysitting\", presumably missing out on wedding stuff.\n\nThat's well within the intent of a \"child free\" wedding, and exactly what SIL was trying to prevent.  It's not just: \"no children were present at any of the festivities\", but also the fact that people had to dip out to care for those children.\n\nIDK why this is hard to understand.  You don't get to make an agreement, and the break it, and then rationalize your behavior because of some self-interested concern:\n\n> *\"Oh, well, we need to morph this into our vacation b/c we haven't been to Hawaii, so, even though we're only going back on our word a little bit, we're doing it anyway, because it makes sense to me!\"*", "I read this:\n\n> *\"some parents took turns babysitting\"*\n\nas, people had to babysit while wedding things were happening.  I mean, that HAD to be the case, right?  Kids weren't watching themselves.  During the ceremony or reception or whatever, who was watching the kids?  People who were attending the wedding, right?\n\nThe children had an impact, which is the spirit of \"child free\".\n\nYou can have a whole separate debate about whether or not the SIL is an asshole for wanting \"child free\", but that's not this issue.", "I'm hardly projecting.  When I say \"that's what SIL wants\", I'm not saying she ***actually*** wanted that b/c I know the situation.  I'm providing an example of a completely defensible ask.\n\nYou can call it \"practicality and experience\", but I was a wedding photographer for years.  And the things I've heard from clients and guests...LOL.\n\nWhen people ask for \"child free\" weddings, they are talking about the ***DISRUPTION*** that children bring.  And having to involve other families to care for your children during a wedding (someone had to watch them not just for \"multiple events\", but during the ceremony and reception, which are pretty damn major in ***anyone's*** account of a wedding) is fairly disruptive.\n\nYes, I'm absolutely contending that it's perfectly reasonable to conclude that if you can't reduce the impact your children will have to a wedding to zero, then you RSVP \"No\" to a \"child free\" wedding.\n\nIDK what the hell your convolution about \"well, they'd be there anyway\" has any relevance.  They were only going to HI ***Because*** of the wedding.  They weren't planning to be there anyway.  If ***that*** was the case, then just send the brother and SIL a message to say: \"Hey, we're on the islands!  Can we pop over, even though we'd have to care for our kids?\"\n\nWhich brings us to another crucial point.  Surely it would have been much more sensible and respectful to just send a note saying: \"I know you said 'child free', but here's what we'd like to do.  Will this be upsetting or inappropriate?\"", "Where does OP mention this? She has yet to confirm questions of who watched her kids.", "I agree. Everyone is asking, but OP won't comment.", "By OP bringing her children to Hawaii, she guaranteed SOMEONE would have to miss the wedding events. Unless OP got a babysitter while in Hawaii to watch the children, she\u2019s the AH. If she got a babysitter that wasn\u2019t family/invited to the wedding events then she\u2019s not the AH. However, OP refused to comment on who watched the kids while she didn\u2019t.", ">The kids not only impacted OP's family, but OTHER FAMILIES as well, because \"some parents took turns babysitting\", presumably missing out on wedding stuff.\n\nYes, the other families impacted were the ones that also traveled with their children, if OP hadn't brought their children the other kids would still need someone to take care of them. And if none of those families had gone to Hawaii, then the bride would had had less people paying attention to her, not more. \n\n>You don't get to make an agreement, and the break it, \n\nNobody broke any agreement. The agreement was for a child free wedding, the wedding was child free. Not traveling with your kids is in any way a request somebody is entitled to do, it's not something that anybody should consider reasonable to ask, and it is in not included in the child free wedding etiquette.\n\nHonestly I think you are being very dismissive of the effort that an entire family did for their family member to be there at an important event while also respecting their wishes.", "She says in the post parents took turns", "it doesn\u2019t need to be confirmed. she said in the original post that multiple people had kids they wanted to bring. why are you assuming they made random guests watch the kids", "> *\"Honestly I think you are being very dismissive of the effort that an entire family did for their family member to be there at an important event while also respecting their wishes.\"*\n\nIt's not about their effort.  It's about whether or not I feel OP acted in contravention of her agreement.\n\nA \"child free\" wedding--as I mentioned above, in my years of experience as a wedding photographer--is not just about \"not having children present during X or Y.\"  It's as much about not wanting to have the ***disruption*** of children.\n\nI have children.  I would be bummed if we couldn't see a family member get married b/c they wanted a \"child free\" wedding.  But we'd decline.  My wife agrees, if that makes any difference.\n\nYou--and others in this thread--seem to be substituting the importance ***YOU FEEL*** in ***YOUR PREROGATIVE TO ATTEND*** the wedding, with what the SIL clearly wanted.\n\nI did not get the sense from OP's post that there were other children.  It was hinted at, but never said.  It sounds to me that other parents left their kids at home, but OP decided to bring hers.\n\nBut, even if everyone brought their kids, and created a child-care maelstrom, I'm not sure how that's better.  One adult can effective watch 2, maybe 3 kids?  If 10 families (or 50?) brought kids, that's a lot of adults that need to be caring for children during the ceremony and reception (not to mention any other events).\n\nAnd, judging by SIL's reaction, she didn't want that.\n\nIt's not about anyone trying to limit how your kid or family travels.  But, at a \"child free\" wedding, they want you to be able to hire help to watch the children during the main wedding events--and what qualifies as \"main wedding events\" is something the bride & groom get to decide.\n\nIf no one could afford that, then the brother (SIL's fiance) should have said to SIL: \"Look--this 'no child' thing isn't going to work; my family can't afford to hire help to watch the kids.  Either live with the fact that people are going to have to babysit, or half my family can't come.\"\n\nBut we have no idea if that convo happened.  All I'm saying is, OP bringing kids, and expecting that people miss wedding things to babysit, is definitely \"YTA\"-worthy.", "Which is the parents right and obligation to do. As long as no one brought kids to wedding events, it\u2019s fine. \n\nIf your point is that maybe sometimes one of the parents had to miss a wedding event, well yeah. That happens when you\u2019re a parent. You miss things. What\u2019s worse? One person to miss one event while watching all the kids, another to miss another dinner, and so on, or many adults missing the whole trip to Hawaii because someone had to stay home with their kids?\n\nAt least this way the kids were corralled and one parent can watch several families worth of kids at a time.", "No, my point was that OP DID say who watched the kids.

During weddings people go out all the time, to smoke, to the bathroom, to chat, so a couple of people missing at any moment from each festivity or the venue is normal for any event, so people a couple of people missing because they are taking care of the kids during this particular activity it's not that different (OP said one person was taking care of the kids, but let's assume that it's more than one).\n\nAt the end of the day they asked for a child free wedding and people did the best to be able to attend (because again, they were invited, so it's fair to assume that the couple wanted them there) and to follow their wishes (which they did by keeping the kids from all the wedding related activities).", "So, where would these parents have left their kids when they went to Hawaii for this wedding. Would the bride rather them not go since the grandma wasn't going and they didn't have childcare? Wouldn't that be the same effect as what you said above, but probably more parents would have never gone and attended any of the events. Sorry, but my children trump any family members wedding and getting adequate childcare for a trip to Hawaii isn't necessarily easy.", "Yes, it sounds like all of the people who watched the children were parents who made arrangements to ensure they\u2019d be able to attend the wedding in Hawaii without having to bring their children to any of the child free wedding events. It actually sounds like they made a great deal of effort and coordinating to show up for the wedding couple. Most people just don\u2019t travel by plane to a child free wedding. At least they made sure to get there and respect their child free wishes.", "The people watching the kids had kids. If they didn't have the parents rotating through watching the kids during wedding events all of them would have declined the invitation.", "The bride isn't guaranteed any guests at all, though. Particularly not for a wedding held in another state where she didn't pay for travel accommodations. If other people volunteered to help watch the kids, I know a lot of grandparents who would, then I don't see the harm. \n\nMy husband and I decided to elope and let family/friends know they could show up if they wanted. Our family/friends couldn't, but we chose that.", "I read her post as the parents took turns watching the kids OUTSIDE of anything wedding related. When the wedding was happening, all rsvp'd guests were present and participating.\n\nWho watched the kids during the wedding ceremonies, and how was that planned out? If they were being disruptive during ceremonies, walking in and out to switch childcare shifts, that was extremely rude, poorly planned, and OP is the AH.\n\nSo, now the question is, how did they go about exchanging shifts and when?", "Oh yep. I meant to reply to Chef4disney. Sorry!", "So....then don't go to Hawaii if you can't find adequate childcare that doesn't disrupt ceremonies and doesn't take from the bride's guestlist. \n\nI want to know details as to where the kids were too! That's why I'm asking questions and suggesting situations. \n\nAs long as OP DID NOT use rsvp'd guests to watch the kids and DID NOT disrupt ceremonies leaving and entering to switch childcare shifts OP is not the asshole. \n\nBut until we know exactly how childcare was handled during ceremonies, we can only make assumptions from OP's post.", "NTA. I've had a surprising number of friends do destination weddings, and every single one of them was hoping that people would do exactly what your family did and turn the trip into their own vacation. A friend of mine got married in France a few years ago, so I planned a trip to a few different places in Europe right after her wedding and I swear she spent as much time asking about plans for my trip as I did asking about her wedding (which, as a bridesmaid, was a **lot**). \n\nAs long as the kids didn't crash wedding events I think you're totally in the clear. Realistically, if you're doing a destination wedding you're running a huge risk that people you really want there can't make it, so even if people alternated missing wedding events to watch the kids they were probably still more present than they'd have been if they'd had to miss the wedding entirely to stay home with their kids.", "I'll probably get downed to hell but\n\nESH for the simple fact that you traveled to a destination whose natives have asked us mainlanders to stop visiting because we are still in a Pandemic and as a small chain of islands, it damages the population", "NTA  \nYour SIL's WEDDING was child free.

OP says many of the married family members have children. It sounds like had they not made this arrangement amongst themselves it would\u2019ve negatively effected the guest count.

I\u2019m sure a few missed an event here or there but they didn\u2019t miss the entire trip", "Agreed. And I really don\u2019t get a person having a childfree destination wedding and inviting a good amount of people with kids and then being upset when they DO travel to show their support and DONT let a single child step foot in any of her events", "yeah i think we've lost something turning weddings into whatever showcase events they've become instead of family celebrations of a social contract. it's a celebration of joining together and sharing things, not roleplaying celebrity for a day.", "Seriously. If all the trusted family members were going on this trip, I would never leave my child hundreds of miles away from me with someone else for multiple nights. So I just wouldn\u2019t go to the wedding at all. I imagine a lot of parents would make that calculation. This arrangement probably HELPED the guest count.", "That one genuinely irked me", "Nah, just put a splint on it.", "Exactly.  These Brides who insist on child-free destination weddings never seem to bother to offer to pay for childcare, then have a fit when guests with kids deal with that on their own.  I just don't bother to go.", "That sounds exhausting.", "but the SIL absolutely does not get to throw a fit about this. we're also not told if the rotating adults gave the couple a head's up for who would miss which events, and they might have, for a destination wedding they PAID for their own travel and hotel arrangements for. \n\nat any wedding, a guest not showing up for the ceremony might be disappointing a little but that's a price you risk paying when you pick child-free wedding. depending on travel, babysitter availability, finances, kids' ages and comfort, an adult might have to miss something. that isn't being an asshole. bringing the kids to the ceremony when they've been told not to bring them would be different, but the SIL has zero right to dictate how each family made childcare arrangements and how they decided which adult would sit out to do it. period.", "Lmfao you guys are ridiculous.

They made a plan to ensure they could all travel to support her in Hawaii and still not bring their kids to her wedding and events. Her being upset IS unhinged", "Events cost money. OP doesn\u2019t have to to tell us that. OP also said that the parents took turns babysitting all the kids which means at each event at least one wedding guest was missing. I can see how OP\u2019s SIL might have felt that her guests were treating her wedding as a low priority.
