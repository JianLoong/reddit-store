I'm a (48m) who inherited a beach house from my grandfather. The house has been in my family for generations, and it has a lot of sentimental value to me. I am now with my long-term girlfriend for seven years after a divorce from my first wife which ended on good terms. She has a daughter from a previous marriage, and I have a daughter from my marriage as well. Our daughters are each 17 with mine being basically three months younger. Kara, the oldest will be 18 in May. \n\nKara has been in my life for seven years and we have a good relationship however she has an active father in her life so I did not fill that role. I was in her life 50% of the time so I have no doubt I played a large role in her life, but I wouldn\u2019t say father, but others do say a nonlegal step-father.  I have my daughter, Emmy, half time as well aside from Summers where I had her more due to my and my ex\u2019s lifestyle. With that said, my ex and I have a good relationship as does our daughter with all of us. Kara and Emmy have gotten along, and they are friendly. They have made plans independent of myself and my GF but they don\u2019t consider themselves sisters or best friends. \n\nNow to the issue. Kara will be going to school near the beach house and has asked if she can live in it to save the money which would be significant. Emmy approached me and has said she wanted to live there after the Summer but wanted to live alone while also in school. The home is more than big enough for two, but she pointed out that they have very different lifestyles and would be far more comfortable alone or with a friend if I insisted she live with someone. It was a frank conversation and she brought up the fact that the home will be hers one day, so it made sense, and she\u2019s right, the home will be hers by law in a few years as I will pass it to her. \n\nMy GF and Kara are very upset and calling it favoritism and pointing out that she will already be set for life between having a free ride to school via scholarships and housing while Kara will be using loans. And may have to take a gap year or attend another school altogether. They are asking me to reconsider, and I think I\u2019ve damaged my relationship. \n\nAITA for this decision? I agree that it\u2019s favoritism, but Emmy is my daughter\u2026 Of course I\u2019m going to favour her, right?", "created_utc": 1677338762, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bnjsv/aita_for_housing_my_daughter_by_not_my_stepdaugher/", "score": 6513, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm a (48m) who inherited a beach house from my grandfather. The house has been in my family for generations, and it has a lot of sentimental value to me. I am now with my long-term girlfriend for seven years after a divorce from my first wife which ended on good terms. She has a daughter from a previous marriage, and I have a daughter from my marriage as well. Our daughters are each 17 with mine being basically three months younger. Kara, the oldest will be 18 in May. \n\nKara has been in my life for seven years and we have a good relationship however she has an active father in her life so I did not fill that role. I was in her life 50% of the time so I have no doubt I played a large role in her life, but I wouldn\u2019t say father, but others do say a nonlegal step-father.  I have my daughter, Emmy, half time as well aside from Summers where I had her more due to my and my ex\u2019s lifestyle. With that said, my ex and I have a good relationship as does our daughter with all of us. Kara and Emmy have gotten along, and they are friendly. They have made plans independent of myself and my GF but they don\u2019t consider themselves sisters or best friends. \n\nNow to the issue. Kara will be going to school near the beach house and has asked if she can live in it to save the money which would be significant. Emmy approached me and has said she wanted to live there after the Summer but wanted to live alone while also in school. The home is more than big enough for two, but she pointed out that they have very different lifestyles and would be far more comfortable alone or with a friend if I insisted she live with someone. It was a frank conversation and she brought up the fact that the home will be hers one day, so it made sense, and she\u2019s right, the home will be hers by law in a few years as I will pass it to her. \n\nMy GF and Kara are very upset and calling it favoritism and pointing out that she will already be set for life between having a free ride to school via scholarships and housing while Kara will be using loans. And may have to take a gap year or attend another school altogether. They are asking me to reconsider, and I think I\u2019ve damaged my relationship. \n\nAITA for this decision?

In terms of patrimony, allowing Kara equal access to the house also opens the door to a future legal challenge against Emmy to give her stake in the property (which will then have been Kara's home and to which she will have contributed). It is unfortunate Kara's mother is not in the same position to finance her daughter. That does not mean she can claim part of what he has for Emmy. It is not his responsibility and the only way in which he can give something to Kara in this situation is by taking it away from Emmy--who was his daughter long before he even met Kara's mother. Emmy has already been friendly and welcoming. It is quite another thing to demand that she include Kara in her college experience and share her space and patrimony.

You don\u2019t think you will be entitled to walk the \u201cstepdaughter\u201d down the aisle.  Her father will do that.  They would probably be very upset if you started screaming about how it\u2019s favoritism.  In both cases, it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s just a different relationship.  You should tell them that the favoritism bs is manipulative and they owe you an apology. \n\nI think you and your gf also need to really think through finances going forward.  Is she going to expect you to pay for part of the kid\u2019s wedding?  Does she contribute to your kid?  How will you handle retirement?

If you really are a partner to your long term girlfriend I would hope that you see how hurtful it appears to not want to help her daughter also with her education. It sounds like her daughter could use some help with attaining her higher education and yes free housing is a huge help/gift/offer, especially if the school is in a high rent cost area.

Such as compromise and respect. It\u2019s your house still and inheritance aside you can choose to help out your other non bio kid in a very important and pivotal time of their life. Set rules, boundaries and expectations with both young women in an open conversation- make a space where they can respectfully voice concerns about living together and talk as a family about that. Sign agreements with both about house rules and expectations- maybe even make a stipulation to both that their gpa needs to stay above a 3.0 to remain in the beach house. Get security cameras and keep an eye on things. Plan some family visit weekends early on at the beach house and stay in the loop. \n\nOr- let your daughter live there free and get roommates that are her friends and have them pay RENT. Use the rental income to help your girlfriend\u2019s kid with renting their own studio apartment.

By taking the low road they come off as greedy and grasping, demanding something they weren\u2019t entitled to.", "You can be in a child\u2019s life for a long time but still not be financially responsible for them. The parents aren\u2019t even married. Kara has a dad. It\u2019s not up to OP to make the girls equal.", "She could also probably get work study. I did that. It takes a chunk out too.", "And he thinks it\u2019s awkward now? Going to be a thousand times more awkward trying to inevitably kick her out in under a years time.", "Kara isn't really anything to OP except GF's daughter who he's graciously treated well....and Kara has just become accustomed to it.\n\nI shudder to think of Kara's first spouse if they divorce...the \"style in which Kara has become accustomed\" clause will be INSANE unless spouse-to-be has an ironclad prenup and there are no kids born of that union.", "I mean if he let her move in. And his daughter can\u2019t get along with SD and huge fights happen and she evicts SD\u2026 \n\nRelationship also over", "Were people in your life sympathetic? I ask because I feel like for people of my parents' generation, there was this bizarre idea that learning to share a goddamn bedroom with a random stranger is an important skill, and that insurmountable issues like those two people you dealt with were somehow your responsibility to figure out by talking to the person.", "And David Tennant is really cool actor, whose brother is in a famous band, no?", "My bet is Emmy has already cleared it with the coach(es).  She sounds like a planner.\n\nAnd a QUIET house where Emmy can study, sleep soundly, and exercise is a net benefit.\n\nKara can join the Air Force as Kara's mother has suggested."]}
