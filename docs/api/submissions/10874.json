I'm a (48m) who inherited a beach house from my grandfather. The house has been in my family for generations, and it has a lot of sentimental value to me. I am now with my long-term girlfriend for seven years after a divorce from my first wife which ended on good terms. She has a daughter from a previous marriage, and I have a daughter from my marriage as well. Our daughters are each 17 with mine being basically three months younger. Kara, the oldest will be 18 in May. \n\nKara has been in my life for seven years and we have a good relationship however she has an active father in her life so I did not fill that role. I was in her life 50% of the time so I have no doubt I played a large role in her life, but I wouldn\u2019t say father, but others do say a nonlegal step-father.  I have my daughter, Emmy, half time as well aside from Summers where I had her more due to my and my ex\u2019s lifestyle. With that said, my ex and I have a good relationship as does our daughter with all of us. Kara and Emmy have gotten along, and they are friendly. They have made plans independent of myself and my GF but they don\u2019t consider themselves sisters or best friends. \n\nNow to the issue. Kara will be going to school near the beach house and has asked if she can live in it to save the money which would be significant. Emmy approached me and has said she wanted to live there after the Summer but wanted to live alone while also in school. The home is more than big enough for two, but she pointed out that they have very different lifestyles and would be far more comfortable alone or with a friend if I insisted she live with someone. It was a frank conversation and she brought up the fact that the home will be hers one day, so it made sense, and she\u2019s right, the home will be hers by law in a few years as I will pass it to her. \n\nMy GF and Kara are very upset and calling it favoritism and pointing out that she will already be set for life between having a free ride to school via scholarships and housing while Kara will be using loans. And may have to take a gap year or attend another school altogether. They are asking me to reconsider, and I think I\u2019ve damaged my relationship. \n\nAITA for this decision? I agree that it\u2019s favoritism, but Emmy is my daughter\u2026 Of course I\u2019m going to favour her, right?", "created_utc": 1677338762, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bnjsv/aita_for_housing_my_daughter_by_not_my_stepdaugher/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I really don't think her desire should be de deal breaker here 1 if she wouldn't be helping with maintenance of the house, 2 only because she'll inherited it eventually, but most importantly 3 if this decision will impact Kara's future as harshly as it seems like it will. \n\nAlthough you're not Kara's father, nor a father figure per se, you've been with her mom since she was teen, she probably remembers more of her life with you in it then out of it, it amazes me a bit that you are that willing to throw her under the bus like that, as you recognized not allowing her to live there would. \n\nOverall, I do think it's a NAH situation, and that the closest to an AH in this is your daughter, specially if she's aware of what her veto would imply to Kara, but your apparent lack of care for the consequences to Kara is AHish as well. \n\nI do think in your situation I would impose they sharing the house as a condition to either of them to live there, but it isn't an internet stranger's call.", "NTA your daughter comes first, and having a strained relationship with your step daughter and girlfriend is less worse than having one with your daughter", "NTA - is your daughter's right to have it as its been in the family, for the family - by blood.

I'm a (48m) who inherited a beach house from my grandfather. The house has been in my family for generations, and it has a lot of sentimental value to me. I am now with my long-term girlfriend for seven years after a divorce from my first wife which ended on good terms. She has a daughter from a previous marriage, and I have a daughter from my marriage as well. Our daughters are each 17 with mine being basically three months younger. Kara, the oldest will be 18 in May. \n\nKara has been in my life for seven years and we have a good relationship however she has an active father in her life so I did not fill that role. I was in her life 50% of the time so I have no doubt I played a large role in her life, but I wouldn\u2019t say father, but others do say a nonlegal step-father.  I have my daughter, Emmy, half time as well aside from Summers where I had her more due to my and my ex\u2019s lifestyle. With that said, my ex and I have a good relationship as does our daughter with all of us. Kara and Emmy have gotten along, and they are friendly. They have made plans independent of myself and my GF but they don\u2019t consider themselves sisters or best friends. \n\nNow to the issue. Kara will be going to school near the beach house and has asked if she can live in it to save the money which would be significant. Emmy approached me and has said she wanted to live there after the Summer but wanted to live alone while also in school. The home is more than big enough for two, but she pointed out that they have very different lifestyles and would be far more comfortable alone or with a friend if I insisted she live with someone. It was a frank conversation and she brought up the fact that the home will be hers one day, so it made sense, and she\u2019s right, the home will be hers by law in a few years as I will pass it to her. \n\nMy GF and Kara are very upset and calling it favoritism and pointing out that she will already be set for life between having a free ride to school via scholarships and housing while Kara will be using loans. And may have to take a gap year or attend another school altogether. They are asking me to reconsider, and I think I\u2019ve damaged my relationship. \n\nAITA for this decision? I agree that it\u2019s favoritism, but Emmy is my daughter\u2026 Of course I\u2019m going to favour her, right?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Good on you for supporting your daughter as best you can!", "Info: what does different lifestyles mean? Because from Emmy having scholarships and Kara having none, it could mean that the latter leans more towards a party lifestyle and it would be understandable for Emmy not to want to share a space with someone who might make a huge mess or lots of noise with parties.

He had offered the house as college housing to his daughter, whose family house it is. Emmy is not obligated to share her college housing with her stepsister. He is not obligated to finance his stepdaughter's college. In terms of patrimony, allowing Kara equal access to the house also opens the door to a future legal challenge against Emmy to give her stake in the property (which will then have been Kara's home and to which she will have contributed). It is unfortunate Kara's mother is not in the same position to finance her daughter. That does not mean she can claim part of what he has for Emmy. It is not his responsibility and the only way in which he can give something to Kara in this situation is by taking it away from Emmy--who was his daughter long before he even met Kara's mother. Emmy has already been friendly and welcoming. It is quite another thing to demand that she include Kara in her college experience and share her space and patrimony.
