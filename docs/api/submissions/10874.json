I'm a (48m) who inherited a beach house from my grandfather. The house has been in my family for generations, and it has a lot of sentimental value to me. I am now with my long-term girlfriend for seven years after a divorce from my first wife which ended on good terms. She has a daughter from a previous marriage, and I have a daughter from my marriage as well. Our daughters are each 17 with mine being basically three months younger. Kara, the oldest will be 18 in May. \n\nKara has been in my life for seven years and we have a good relationship however she has an active father in her life so I did not fill that role. I was in her life 50% of the time so I have no doubt I played a large role in her life, but I wouldn\u2019t say father, but others do say a nonlegal step-father.  I have my daughter, Emmy, half time as well aside from Summers where I had her more due to my and my ex\u2019s lifestyle. With that said, my ex and I have a good relationship as does our daughter with all of us. Kara and Emmy have gotten along, and they are friendly. They have made plans independent of myself and my GF but they don\u2019t consider themselves sisters or best friends. \n\nNow to the issue. Kara will be going to school near the beach house and has asked if she can live in it to save the money which would be significant. Emmy approached me and has said she wanted to live there after the Summer but wanted to live alone while also in school. The home is more than big enough for two, but she pointed out that they have very different lifestyles and would be far more comfortable alone or with a friend if I insisted she live with someone. It was a frank conversation and she brought up the fact that the home will be hers one day, so it made sense, and she\u2019s right, the home will be hers by law in a few years as I will pass it to her. \n\nMy GF and Kara are very upset and calling it favoritism and pointing out that she will already be set for life between having a free ride to school via scholarships and housing while Kara will be using loans. And may have to take a gap year or attend another school altogether. They are asking me to reconsider, and I think I\u2019ve damaged my relationship. \n\nAITA for this decision? I agree that it\u2019s favoritism, but Emmy is my daughter\u2026 Of course I\u2019m going to favour her, right?", "created_utc": 1677338762, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bnjsv/aita_for_housing_my_daughter_by_not_my_stepdaugher/", "score": 2476, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm a (48m) who inherited a beach house from my grandfather. The house has been in my family for generations, and it has a lot of sentimental value to me. I am now with my long-term girlfriend for seven years after a divorce from my first wife which ended on good terms. She has a daughter from a previous marriage, and I have a daughter from my marriage as well. Our daughters are each 17 with mine being basically three months younger. Kara, the oldest will be 18 in May. \n\nKara has been in my life for seven years and we have a good relationship however she has an active father in her life so I did not fill that role. I was in her life 50% of the time so I have no doubt I played a large role in her life, but I wouldn\u2019t say father, but others do say a nonlegal step-father.  I have my daughter, Emmy, half time as well aside from Summers where I had her more due to my and my ex\u2019s lifestyle. With that said, my ex and I have a good relationship as does our daughter with all of us. Kara and Emmy have gotten along, and they are friendly. They have made plans independent of myself and my GF but they don\u2019t consider themselves sisters or best friends. \n\nNow to the issue. Kara will be going to school near the beach house and has asked if she can live in it to save the money which would be significant. Emmy approached me and has said she wanted to live there after the Summer but wanted to live alone while also in school. The home is more than big enough for two, but she pointed out that they have very different lifestyles and would be far more comfortable alone or with a friend if I insisted she live with someone. It was a frank conversation and she brought up the fact that the home will be hers one day, so it made sense, and she\u2019s right, the home will be hers by law in a few years as I will pass it to her. \n\nMy GF and Kara are very upset and calling it favoritism and pointing out that she will already be set for life between having a free ride to school via scholarships and housing while Kara will be using loans. And may have to take a gap year or attend another school altogether. They are asking me to reconsider, and I think I\u2019ve damaged my relationship. \n\nAITA for this decision?

In terms of patrimony, allowing Kara equal access to the house also opens the door to a future legal challenge against Emmy to give her stake in the property (which will then have been Kara's home and to which she will have contributed). It is unfortunate Kara's mother is not in the same position to finance her daughter. That does not mean she can claim part of what he has for Emmy. It is not his responsibility and the only way in which he can give something to Kara in this situation is by taking it away from Emmy--who was his daughter long before he even met Kara's mother. Emmy has already been friendly and welcoming. It is quite another thing to demand that she include Kara in her college experience and share her space and patrimony.

You don\u2019t think you will be entitled to walk the \u201cstepdaughter\u201d down the aisle.  Her father will do that.  They would probably be very upset if you started screaming about how it\u2019s favoritism.  In both cases, it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s just a different relationship.  You should tell them that the favoritism bs is manipulative and they owe you an apology. \n\nI think you and your gf also need to really think through finances going forward.  Is she going to expect you to pay for part of the kid\u2019s wedding?  Does she contribute to your kid?  How will you handle retirement?

If you really are a partner to your long term girlfriend I would hope that you see how hurtful it appears to not want to help her daughter also with her education. It sounds like her daughter could use some help with attaining her higher education and yes free housing is a huge help/gift/offer, especially if the school is in a high rent cost area. It\u2019s a generous thing to do, but it also sounds like it isn\u2019t an additional financial burden upon you. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault that bio dad is a financial mess, it\u2019s also not the daughter\u2019s fault as we don\u2019t choose our parents.

Such as compromise and respect. It\u2019s your house still and inheritance aside you can choose to help out your other non bio kid in a very important and pivotal time of their life. Set rules, boundaries and expectations with both young women in an open conversation- make a space where they can respectfully voice concerns about living together and talk as a family about that. Sign agreements with both about house rules and expectations- maybe even make a stipulation to both that their gpa needs to stay above a 3.0 to remain in the beach house. Get security cameras and keep an eye on things. Plan some family visit weekends early on at the beach house and stay in the loop. \n\nOr- let your daughter live there free and get roommates that are her friends and have them pay RENT. Use the rental income to help your girlfriend\u2019s kid with renting their own studio apartment. Your can\u2019t have many raging parties in a studio, and your girlfriend and her daughter will feel like you\u2019re invested in them and their happiness and success as well. \n\nAs you say you\u2019d choose your daughter\u2019s happiness over your own- how do you expect your girlfriend to not put her daughter\u2019s happiness over her own also?

She will have friends over all hours regardless of house rules, and will have no incentive to be a good student when she can just hang at the beach house. You are a good dad and a prudent landowner for not letting Kara live there.", "Eh, in terms of the social aspect of college, the fact that the house is a beach house is a point of concern. Maybe Kara would focus on academics, maybe not. The fact that Emmy earned scholarships while Kara did not suggests there is some difference in their work ethic as students. \n\nBut in any case, having a cool place like a beach house would attract a lot of fake \u201cfriends\u201d who would encourage Kara to party a lot so they could enjoy hanging out or partying at her beach house. Would she have the strength of character to refuse, or would she be swept up in being a \u201cpopular girl\u201d because people like using her for access to a nice party/hangout spot? If the latter, how would that affect Emmy and her ability to study and continue her education?\n\nIt seems to me that Emmy has thought about this, and concluded living with Kara would not go well because of their different degree of seriousness about school. What *you* should think about is the potential for property damage and legal complications if Kara decides she wants the social cachet of \u201chey everybody, come party at my beach house!\u201d every weekend or whatever. I\u2019d say it is not worth that risk or the potential impact on Emmy\u2019s school career. \n\nAnd you would not really be doing Kara any favors if living there might lead to her neglecting her studies in favor of her social life.
