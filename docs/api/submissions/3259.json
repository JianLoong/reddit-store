She's not very litigious, wouldn't have the money to hire a lawyer (especially since everything she's done is easy to prove via building security cameras and my text/email records), and paperwork is very much not her strong suit.", "created_utc": 1669431395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4w59r/wibta_if_i_warned_others_about_my_former_petsitter/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It gives me pause that she doesn\u2019t have references at this point if this is what she does for a living. Her behavior at your home was unhinged, was she drunk? And her follow up was terrible. I don\u2019t think she should be trusted in other people\u2019s homes. And it pains me to say so, as she indeed be without any source of income.

Report her for harassment, take all the proof you have. You could warn everyone about her but at what cost to yourself? Warn your neighbours incase she comes sniffing around but otherwise, file a report, make it as difficult as possible for her to contact you and move on.", "INFO: How public is this Facebook group?  Can only members see what is posted?\n\nGenerally speaking, I don't think it would be wrong to \"warn\" a private group about factual issues you've had, issues you know are completely true.\n\nBut I'm afraid if this group is too public or perhaps even too big, \"warning\" might start to fall a bit more into the category of publicly \"shaming\"\n\nIn any case, I hope management is a bit understanding of the situation and ya'll at least can get things worked out.", "Solid advice.

But I\u2019d steer clear of saying anything publicly, and especially anything in writing. \n \nI\u2019d recommend going by the rules most companies have to go by. If someone asks for a reference or how they were as an employee you say \u201cI can\u2019t comment with specifics but she is not eligible to work for me again.\u201d And leave it at that. \n \nBecause technically, you *were* her employer.

But do you really want the hassle of finding out the hard way?", "Do you think she behaves on those jobs?", "Not an invalid point...\n\nBut I think there is still a difference.  For example, in the case of a restaurant review, these are generally public, the restaurant knows about them, and has a chance for rebuttal and give their side of the story,\n\nBut in this case, we're talking about posting a private review the sitter might never know about and never have an opportunity to tell her side of the story.\n\nBut I must say your point gives me some pause to think.", "Based on your talk with management, hopefully they understand that they pretty much can ignore anything this woman says (unless there is something she could revel about you that could cause a problem)", "This. \n \nJust because you have video doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still be sued, and then have to deal with trying to get rid of the lawsuit. I\u2019m not an attorney but I argue with them for a living, even if you\u2019re 100% in the right you still have to go through this whole court process to prove it. It\u2019s expensive and time consuming, and a huge hassle. \n \nYou\u2019re the only one who can decide if it\u2019s worth it or not.", "I've always considered her eccentric, so I imagine she does some weird things like rearranging their home or using my hairbrush to comb the cats. But my guess is she hasn't done anything this bad or they would have fired her as well. \n\nShe did tell me once that one of the dogs she looks after keeps jumping out of the car and running off when she's in the grocery store. That was pretty horrifying to hear tbh, but I assumed she would have told the owner?", "I understand what you're saying, but at the end of the day I personally feel like this is a problem they created for themselves due to their unprofessional behavior, so I don't care. This is a \"them\" problem.\n\nI would have personally written a letter to my local newspaper to warn folks about their negligence. In another comment OP mentioned how the pet sitter had admitted to having another customer's dog run away multiple times.\n\nAt this point not saying anything is doing a disservice to every person who may be currently using them. Many of these people may not have any idea of how poorly they are caring for their pets.\n\nI can tell you right now I'd want to know about this. I consider my pet a part of the family as much as anyone else and I wouldn't want some asshole like this taking care of them. They are literally responsible for a living, breathing creature.", "More that she seems completely unhinged lol. If she does show up to talk to my building's management I'd say best case scenario she'd make a scene and embarrass me further. Worst case is she makes up some lies.

The fact they were bothering you is already bad enough, the fact they were bothering your family is like way over the line and insanely unprofessional.\n\nLike I said in another comment, just stick to the facts, as long as you do that, I don't personally believe you have anything to fear.\n\nI also want to state that my previous above comment was also about here as well. Like, you don't really have any evidence to imply she re-arranges people's furniture, so I just don't see the point in trying to imply they may.\n\nSo unless you are saying that they have personally re-arranged your furniture, just leave the assumptions at the door.", "DO NOT post to the group. File Your police report and let the rest happen as it will. If anybody asks you directly in person, just tell them the police are handling it for you and you don't want to talk about it.

File the report then post in the groups about the report and why it was needed. That way, people know there's an issue and they make make an informed decision about who they hire.", "NTA - if people on the group were asking about her but if you\u2019re posting out of the blue, it may look odd.
