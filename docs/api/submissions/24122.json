And yeah, by living with your dad you are condoning what he did. Or at least, you're saying that you don't care about what he did as long as you don't have to be inconvenienced by it. \n\nThat said, I can't blame a 14-yo for wanting to stay in his own room in his own house and not be completely uprooted. This can't be easy for you - your parents getting a divorce, having to choose between them. \n\nI may get downvoted for this, but I'm going with a *soft* YTA.", "INFO: Why can't there be a split custody? For example you alternate every other week who you stay with? That seems like a better alternative than you just going fully with your dad\n\nIt seems kind of an asshole move to live full time with your dad and not see your mother much, because she did nothing wrong here but is essentially being punished by not being able to see you regularly. And that decision is not being based on who you get along with better or anything like that but simply because your dad has more money to provide things for you. Essentially your dad set your mother up for failure by having a pre-nup where she gets nothing and because her job for 16 years was to take care of you and your sister and the home in which you all live in she was not able to set aside money or have money of her own in case something like this happened. And now after she's been there for you your whole life you want to go live with your dad because he's able to spend more money on your than your mother is going to be able to. \n\nAt the end of the day, obviously, it is your choice on what you do. But that being said, other people don't have to be okay with that. Your mother and your sister have a right to feel how they feel about the situation. You can have your feelings that it isn't a betrayal because to you it is doing what's right for you, and your sister can have her feelings that it is a betrayal because she's doing what's right by your mother. I think what you aren't seeing and maybe why you sister is so upset, is that your sister has the same opportunity and knows that financially she would be better off with your dad too. However, she is standing behind what she thinks is morally right and what's best for your mother, and all she sees is that you are selfishly thinking what's best for you.", "Unfortunately at this age it\u2019s all about the stuff they can get.

So, while to you this makes sense*, they just don\u2019t understand it.\n\nI think my official ruling is ESH. You really are choosing money over the wronged party. And, wether or not your reasoning is valid, I don\u2019t think they should be responding that way.", "YTA because if this situation even exists, it was obviously written by the dad, who is also a major asshole.", "I really want updates from this story, you know?

By deciding to live with your father you are ensuring your mother receives less child support than she would be entitled to otherwise. Your father would likely be obligated to support your post-secondary choices (within reason) regardless of where you live. You are also burning a serious bridge with your sister.

You're young and I know that you're very focused on your own life, friends and comfort, but yes, this was an extremely painful thing to do to your mom who's already been hurt. It's one thing to have considered joint custody, but to imply to everyone that your own comfort is more valuable than one side of your family, that's very inconsiderate of you. All of the comforts in the world don't replace strong relationships with your family. I know that's hard to see right now, but as you grow up you will value your family more and more and those temporary comforts less. I hope you find a way to be kind and supportive to your mom, who is going through one of the hardest and most painful experiences of her life.", "NTA.

That was their agreement. It\u2019s not right of your mom to be mad at you for exercising a decision she empowered you to make, regardless of your reason. While I think someday you\u2019ll understand why this decision is being questioned, this is the decision I would expect most 14 year olds to make.", "NTA - You are not the asshole since you have the right to make the decision where you want to live at your age. \n\nMy concern is your post & follow up responses appear that you are definitely following in your father\u2019s footsteps. \n\nYour primary concern is your needs & wants above all others. Your lack of commitment to your family. But what is scary is the complete lack of empathy towards your mother.  I know how most 14 year olds are all about me, me, me-but you are even more so. \n\nNow here is an outsider\u2019s harsh perspective of a 14 year old \u201cchild\u201d:     \n\nYou are your father\u2019s son. You are only concerned about \u201cmy comfort\u201d and your father providing \u201ca better life\u201d.

You\u2019re in a pivotal time in your life and should be where you feel you can best flourish.

Children should not get in the middle of their parent's marital disputes.  (I don't mean literal children, I mean the child of a parent, regardless of age)  You know what your dad did was wrong, and strictly judging by your post it seems you put the blame on him for that.  He made the bad decision, which led to the destruction of your family.  Your mom had her world turned upside down, losing her house, her family life, and now her daughter as well.  That is a terrible blow, and I am sure she is distraught over it. It probably feels to her like you are punishing her for your dad's behavior.  This may not be rational, but emotions seldom are.  Your sister being angry at your dad is a consequence that he chose by choosing to cheat.  You cannot blame her for the way she feels, nor can she or your mom blame you for feeling how you feel.  You did not choose the actions, and yet you're suffering the consequences of adult decisions.  This isn't fair.  Your dad was not thinking of how this would affect your family when he strayed, he was just thinking of himself and his wants.  If I were you I would ask myself if he was going to continue to put his needs and wants first if he is your sole caretaker.  It might be for the best, but it might not be.  Only you can make that choice.  I would encourage you to talk open and honestly with your mom, and truly listen to how she feels.  This is probably the toughest thing she has ever had to go through.  Moms are often there when we need them the most, but we forget that they need someone there for them to.  You should continue to let your mom know that you love her no matter what - even if that means no longer living with her.", "Is your mom in a bad financial place with the prenup?", "NTA\n\nYou were given the option and you chose.

No, but this was a potential outcome.", "Firm NTA, you are 14, if one of the choices your parents allowed you to make was a 'bad' choice they shouldn't have included it as an option. At 14 you could not be an asshole whatever your reason for your decision. Sincerely ignore anyone who says otherwise. If I were you I would ask your dad for therapy, not because something is wrong with you, I think most kids who's parents split could benefit from a bit of therapy to help mentally work things out with an uninvolved adult.\n\nYour sister is NTA because she is also underage. Your mom is TA, incredibly so, for putting blame on you. I'm really sorry you're going through this. Too often when parents split kids are made to bear emotional weight too heavy for their age. This is one of those times.", "YTA", "NTA but its a huge choice that sadly may have huge reprocussions, you need to think if your mom managed to be in a position like your father in a year, even two's time- would you rather be with her? that option could be closed off by taking a firm stance here. you're telling her she can't take care of you the way your father can, make sure that includes all aspects of need not just money. if you depended on her for comfort, you'd now need to depend on him. things like that. its not fair that you gotta deal with all of this, but hopefully you can make the best choice for YOU- not anyone else.", "OP, I hope your mom is calling and texting you and reassuring you of her love even if she\u2019s upset.

I wish you peace of mind after this turmoil.NTA.", "NTA\n\nBrutally tough position, and I see in your comments that moving with your mom would be a different state. Extremely unfair to ask a kid presumably entering their freshman year of high school to completely upend their life as some sort of loyalty test. Not their place to make you choose and you're not TA for your choice. \n\nThat being said, you may not be TA but you will absolutely damage your relationship with both your mother and sister, most likely irreparably. Even if it was all hunky-dory just the fact that you're in different states means you won't even really see them often enough, and during an extremely formative time in your life, and so you'll inevitably drift apart to some degree. And probably much more so if there's genuine ill-will between the three of you. You don't really mention your relationship with your father, but he will be the main family figure in your life for all of high school and in many ways, into adulthood, so I would weigh that difference along with the differences in lifestyle.", "NTA. However, you are very young and beyond sheer financials, at that age it's also important to have solid emotional support and that should factor into your next four years. You're going to be going through so much growing up during that time!

There are things a lot more valuable than money which you'll come to understand over time, one way or another. \"Best choice\"?\n\nThe best choice is to stay with the parent who has the emotional resources to parent well.

If your dad will be able to give you a better life and opportunities to succeed than your mother then there is nothing wrong with picking him over your mother.", "NAH. You\u2019re not TA for choosing what you know is best for you. However, I can very easily see how this would upset your mom and sister.
