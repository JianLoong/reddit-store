I have one flower bed on the side of my house that faces a bunch of windows on my neighbors house. This one flower bed for some reason gets A LOT of sedge grass in it but I can\u2019t spray any herbicide because my wildflowers are so dense. I spend a couple hours a week weeding the bed out by hand and don\u2019t squat to do it I just bend over. Two weeks ago my next door neighbor came out and told me that I need to stop wearing shorts and bending over with my a** to her house. I was kind of caught off guard and told her \u201cmy shorts aren\u2019t short so I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not mooning you\u201d. She then goes on about how she has sons and they don\u2019t need to see my a** when they look out the window and how they\u2019re a lot of older folks in our neighborhood who don\u2019t want to see me either. I got offended because my shorts are appropriate and I\u2019m friendly with the houses around, they have never said anything of the sort to me. Plus it\u2019s 100 plus degrees outside. I also let her know that I have a bad knee so I can\u2019t kneel/squat I bend because that\u2019s what most comfortable. We went back and fourth for a bit until I just wished her a good day and went back inside. I went to my husband and bent over in front of him and asked if he could see my butt from my short and he said no so I just kind of brushed the whole thing off until two days ago I went to go pluck my flower bed and wasn\u2019t bothered. like okay cool I\u2019m in the clear. But then the next morning I looked at my phone and saw a bunch of driveway camera notifications and when I went back to look at the videos this lady was like a movie villain with a gas can pouring liquid on my flower bed. I ran outside and yup.. I could smell the gasoline. I starting bawling. My husband came out to see why I bolted and was like \u201cis that gasoline?\u201d. I showed him the video and he wanted to go over and confront her as he was pissed off. Saying she could have killed us or set our house on fire but I didn\u2019t want to have another argument with this lady so we called to file a police report.  the cops came out and took the report. They told us pouring gas out is illegal and not just vandalism. After sitting outside our house for a while they went to go talk to her and chaos broke out. We could hear her yelling at the cops/threatening them and her kids crying. They called for backup and she was arrested. A bunch of our neighbors were standing outside watching this all go down and so we\u2019re we. Everyone was trying to figure out what happened and I told them about the gasoline and everyone was 50/50. One of the older ladies said that because she was arrested at her house a month ago her kids have already been through enough trauma and I added another event for them. And what if her kids get taken away (the dad is cool). It made me go from feeling like she deserved it to feeling guilty.", "created_utc": 1688252635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o8gjq/aita_for_getting_my_neighbor_arrested_after_she/", "score": 1595, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That logic is highly invalid and is used to try and justify people being AH and letting them get away with it because \"think of the children\" should be met with the remark of \"why, they aren't mine and it was their parent who decided to play a  stupid game, now they will win their stupid prize, actions have consequences.\"", "NTA - she played a stupid game and won a stupid prize", "You are NTA and you didn't get her arrested, her actions did.

Your neighbour did something very illegal , and didn't even think twice. If your bum was not showing , then there's no reason she should get mad. She clearly has some issues if she thinks that you would hurt yourself to comply to her wants. So what if they see your CLOTHED bum ? Everyone has one.", "NTA you tell that lady the trashy MOTHER chose to put her kids through trauma when she committed multple crimes. Point out that only assholes blame the victim whem the perp is arrested.", "NTA FOR SURE WHAT A B****", "NTA.", "She deserved to be arrested, you don\u2019t know if she would have lit a fire. Sounds like she is unhinged. Neighborhood is safer without her for a while", "NTA. You didn\u2019t get her arrested. Her actions got her arrested. Fcked around and found out.", "NTA\n\nAs you said, she could've started a fire and it could've been dangerous for you.\n\n>One of the older ladies said that because she was arrested at her house a month ago her kids have already been through enough trauma and I added another event for them. \n\nWell maybe she should've thought of her kids before doing something as dangerous as pouring gasoline over your plants and endangering lives. Seriously what's that lady saying? That you should've confronted her first instead of calling the cops? All over what? Because she's pissed that you're bending over? Nah, fuck 'em. She deserves to go to jail.", "What her kids go through is her fault not yours.  They arrested her because it was gasoline that she poured. If she's been arrested twice in a short time, there's something seriously wrong with her, and some kind of intervention by CPS would be a good thing.  If the father is stable, the kids will be left with him. Calling the police was the right thing to do. She needs to be corrected. When people like that aren't corrected, they can get worse.", "She's a sad insecure woman with too much time on her hands. You did the right thing. Pouring gasoline into the ground on its own is horrible. Doing it to destroy something pretty is awful as well.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t put her kids at risk of anything. She committed a crime on your property, you reported it. She chose this. \n\nIf anyone is worried about her kids\u2026 simply ask why she chose to vandalize your house? Doesn\u2019t she care about them? How it will effect them?", "NTA. She is the one putting her kids through this. Can you imagine having to live with that? Eew. I think I'd lock myself in my room and give myself prostate exams every minute I was at hone. \n\nAs for the neighbors who think you're in the wrong, 0kease excuse my French but, *ehem*...\n\nFUCK THAT", "NTA. You aren't in any way responsible for any fallout from this. It is squarely on her shoulders. She is the one causing her children trauma, and if she'd stopped committing crimes everything would be fine. The kids may be better off without her, although I know that often isn't the case. Criminal vandalism, and endangering life, can't be ignored because of the possible consequences to the criminal. Should all criminals with children be free to act any way they want? No, of course not. She did this because of your perfectly acceptable shorts! You can't just ignore that.", "NTA! Fck her! And again, fck her! Actions have consequences and her dangerous actions had theirs. All the rest of that stuff that\u2019s going on at their house, that\u2019s not your responsibility!

The neighbor may have spilled maybe 5-10 gallons. While that\u2019s still a significant amount this sort of falls under house hold hazardous waste and is small compared to an underground storage tank. Most states, cities, local governments don\u2019t even have regulations on the books for this quantity of spillage. At best the neighbor could receive a civil fine for open dumping. However, the police may be able to charge her criminally for open dumping.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t condone cleaning hazardous/toxic waste up yourself, having a professional come out and clean this up could be exorbitantly expensive. OP\u2019s best route of action may be to get some PPE (good set of rubber/waterproof boots, gloves, and a respirator should do it), dig the contaminated soil up and place it out on a smooth impervious surface and let the sun bake the gas out. Or dispose of it in another, safe way. If you can afford it, or actually receive help from from an environmental agency or insurance company, you should definitely have a professional clean it up.", "She played a stupid game and won a stupid prize. I\u2019m honestly relieved that you called the police, it worked out 10x better than if you\u2019d just confronted her yourself.", "NtA\n\nUmmm well, now. How is it your fault that this is her second arrest? She likely could have gotten away with a fine and reparations, this time, if she hadn't gone ape on the cops. And you certainly weren't involved with the first arrest.  Or even aware of it, apparently. \n\nKids staying with a decent dad would be best. However, as messed up as the foster system is for kids, it may be safer than being with mom. After all, if your lawn caught fire and burned your house down, her house, with the inevitable dribble of gas leading to it, would also have been at risk.", "Sounds like it might be a good thing if her kids were just with the dad.\n\nNTA. That's appalling behaviour and very dangerous. One spark and the whole fence/house could have gone up.", "Stop feeling guilty. One cigarette tossed out a car window, one puff of wind blowing the wrong way could easily have BURNED DOWN YOUR HOUSE WITH YOUR FAMILY INSIDE IT!! Your neighbors who think you were wrong to call the cops need to be told that!", "NTA. Hilarious that she got arrested over shorts. Hahaha.", "Post this story in r/legaladvice to get info on how to legally proceed from people in the field. Pouring gasoline onto someone\u2019s property is a serious threat, especially when you say it\u2019s been 100+ degrees and it was done with malevolent intent. Protect yourself.", "NTA.. she poured out gasoline! Last I checked that's step 1 for arson.", "Yeah thats psychotic levels of escalation like not calling the police would have been dangerous \n\nI feel bad for her kids because its clear their mom is crazy not because of anything OP did.", "\"How dare you hold me accountable for the results of my actions\" is my favourite kind of AH", "Yeah, someone setting a house up to be torched is definitely trivial. Good call. /s", "Im likely off on this guess, but if other stories on this sub are anything to go by. It wasn't her kids seeing you're butt that pissed her off, she likely caught her husband checking you out as you were bent over and that is what set her off.\n\nBut you are definitely NTA. You did the right thing calling the cops. If she's been in trouble with the law before, then it's her own fault. She's the one that dug her own hole, you did nothing but defend yourself. If she was willing to fight the police, who knows what she would've done if you tried confronting her in private.", "If she was emboldened to purchase and pour gasoline just imagine what could happen next if you hadn't called the police.

DON\u2019T FEEL GUILTY YOU DID NOTHING WRONG.", "There is no rhyme or reason for someone like that and we \"normal\" people try to deal with them in our polite, normal way and sadly, it doesn't work.", "I don\u2019t know, but kids are taken for a reason. It is for their protection", "I have neighbors like this too. The rest of the neighborhood is cool, we wave at each other and chat at the mailboxes on occasion, keep an eye out for each others' children and pets, and we've given out fresh eggs from our chickens and (when we had them) ducks a few times. But the neighbors who live right next to us hate us. They never have a kind word, they always yell at us, they swear at us constantly, and they call us dirty names - like asshole, dipshit, fucker, and more. It's been that way since the day after we moved in, almost six years ago.\n\nIt finally came out that part of the reason they're so pissed off at us is because the neighbors up the hill from us have a small natural spring on their property that, of course, runs downhill when the water table is high enough for it to be active. It fills our pond, and when we're not in a drought, it occasionally runs down to cranky neighbors' house. It's been like that for at least the last 50 years, and they've hated it since they moved in 25 years ago. They seem to blame us for the water making its way across our property and onto theirs.\n\nBut, they liked the neighbors who lived uphill of us when we moved in, so they couldn't be angry at them, and decided to hate the woman who lived here before us instead. They also completely hated her because of her religion and her political views (she's a democrat and we started getting a bunch of Wicca magazines addressed to her after we moved in, they're maga republicans and seem to believe that one of the main tenants of Christianity is to hate thy neighbor). Now, they seem to have decided that we're just an extension of her. That, or they noticed that my wife's mother is a lesbian and decided we're degenerates. Or both. Lucky for us, they're old. Like, call an ambulance because they fell down old.", "Seriously. If she\u2019s been arrested twice in a month, once for pouring a flammable substance all over an adjoining property and screaming at the \npolice, SHE\u2019s the one who\u2019s traumatizing her children, not OP.", "Sge was prob released pending trial. This arrest may mean she is incarcerated until the second trial.", "But, really, you already DID have bad blood, you just had no idea.  You've never said a mean or rude thing to her and she ***poured fuel*** on your garden.  What if you hadn't called and reported it, and the next night she threw the match?  You should get a restraining order and talk to the police about what else you can do to protect yourself.  Maybe someone from your city attorney's office or something along those lines might put her on notice.  You should also let the Fire Dept know what went down so they can put her on their radar and maybe also pay her a visit to discuss arson with her and what the punishment for that is.    \nCurious - does she own the house or rent?", "Get a testraining order preventing her from contacting you.

I know selling isn't a concern right now, but it's not a quick fix so it's better to look onto it now. \n\nIf you ever see a fenced off closed down gas station it's because the tanks leaked fuel into the ground and the property can't be sold until its cleaned, I've seen some that have taken years to fix.", "Definitely call. It could end up turning into a hazmat issue and a way bigger problem for your neighbor.

You obviously have a big heart and so it is understanding that you are troubled by the arrest and questioning if you did the right thing. That said\u2014you absolutely did.

There are consequences for actions.", "You can feel terrible for the children snd also know that you\u2019re not the one responsible or to blame for what is happening to them. That\u2019s on her.

This is not normal or safe behavior.  If she is having some sort of psychiatric issues, the court will try to get her help.  She is still in the wrong.
