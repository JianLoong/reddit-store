I have one flower bed on the side of my house that faces a bunch of windows on my neighbors house. This one flower bed for some reason gets A LOT of sedge grass in it but I can\u2019t spray any herbicide because my wildflowers are so dense. I spend a couple hours a week weeding the bed out by hand and don\u2019t squat to do it I just bend over. Two weeks ago my next door neighbor came out and told me that I need to stop wearing shorts and bending over with my a** to her house. I was kind of caught off guard and told her \u201cmy shorts aren\u2019t short so I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not mooning you\u201d. She then goes on about how she has sons and they don\u2019t need to see my a** when they look out the window and how they\u2019re a lot of older folks in our neighborhood who don\u2019t want to see me either. I got offended because my shorts are appropriate and I\u2019m friendly with the houses around, they have never said anything of the sort to me. Plus it\u2019s 100 plus degrees outside. I also let her know that I have a bad knee so I can\u2019t kneel/squat I bend because that\u2019s what most comfortable. We went back and fourth for a bit until I just wished her a good day and went back inside. I went to my husband and bent over in front of him and asked if he could see my butt from my short and he said no so I just kind of brushed the whole thing off until two days ago I went to go pluck my flower bed and wasn\u2019t bothered. like okay cool I\u2019m in the clear. But then the next morning I looked at my phone and saw a bunch of driveway camera notifications and when I went back to look at the videos this lady was like a movie villain with a gas can pouring liquid on my flower bed. I ran outside and yup.. I could smell the gasoline. I starting bawling. My husband came out to see why I bolted and was like \u201cis that gasoline?\u201d. I showed him the video and he wanted to go over and confront her as he was pissed off. Saying she could have killed us or set our house on fire but I didn\u2019t want to have another argument with this lady so we called to file a police report.  the cops came out and took the report. They told us pouring gas out is illegal and not just vandalism. After sitting outside our house for a while they went to go talk to her and chaos broke out. We could hear her yelling at the cops/threatening them and her kids crying. They called for backup and she was arrested. A bunch of our neighbors were standing outside watching this all go down and so we\u2019re we. Everyone was trying to figure out what happened and I told them about the gasoline and everyone was 50/50. One of the older ladies said that because she was arrested at her house a month ago her kids have already been through enough trauma and I added another event for them. And what if her kids get taken away (the dad is cool). It made me go from feeling like she deserved it to feeling guilty.", "created_utc": 1688252635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o8gjq/aita_for_getting_my_neighbor_arrested_after_she/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her arrest is not your fault. She chose to get belligerent and threaten law enforcement. Any trauma her kids have suffered is 100000000% at her hands. Your neighbors who are on her side are ridiculous. She had no business approaching you in the first place. She sounds completely unhinged. Im so sorry she not only endangered your family and home, but destroyed your garden. She sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA.  Her actions caused her to be arrested, so any trauma is her fault.

Your neighbor did something dangerous *and illegal*, and you alerted the proper authorities. She *threatened the cops*. SHE did that. She got herself arrested. Also, how does her getting arrested a month before have anything to do with you? She probably wouldn\u2019t have been arrested if she didn\u2019t continue to make stupid decisions.", "NTA - her own actions got her arrested. She most likely would have only gotten a warning or a fine if she knew how to behave herself in front of the police. \n\nI would file for a restraining order against her. You have a good reason to do so.\n\nWhy are some of your other neighbours annoyed at you for calling the police? It was the correct course of action. You didn't traumatise her children. She did.

She definitely should have been arrested for that.  You were absolutely in the right to report that behavior.  What if she did burn down your house.  She's polluting the ground and water.  The fact that she was arrested for something a month prior is all the more reason she should be reported.  She's a menace.  \nAlso, if you want to be more modest with the shorts, you could wear a drape of some type, or skirt, shirt, whatever over the back.  I do this for this exact reason.  I hate when the neighbor men gawk and I don't like them looking at my butt whenever I'm trying to just exist.  But pants are too hot, as you've said.", "NTA.

She chose to behave abhorrently and then fight with the police.  Her arrest was the consequence of her action and choice!  Yes, you could have lost your home and your lives from such a stupid, thoughtless stunt.  NTA!!!!!!!  Clearly she made a choice last month that also got her arrested.  That's on her!

Any trauma her kids are feeling is because of her own actions.", "So this woman did something a month ago that got her arrested, then decided it would be a good idea to pour gasoline on your flower bed?  And argue/fight with the cops who go to talk to her?  Apparently this woman does not learn from her prior experiences.  It is not your fault your neighbor is an idiot who can't shut her mouth and feels entitled to do whatever she wants.  Don't feel guilty.  There is only one way someone like your neighbor learns a lesson and it is the hard way.  If you had just let it go and not contacted the cops, she'd have done other things to you and your stuff.  Nope, best to nip this in the bud early.", "NTA.  \n\nDumping a hazardous chemical which happens to be flammable is going to be an environmental hazard.  \n\nYou may need to hire a 3rd party cleanup firm to dispose of the soil which is not cheap \n\nIf your neighbor doesn't pay, a lawsuit is coming at your neighbor.  \n\nYou may also need to file an insurance claim to remediate the soil\n\nDon't think for a moment this is over.

You didn't get her arrested, *she got herself arrested!*  Ignore any neighbors who feel you're at fault.  At any point, she could have saved herself the trouble: not confronting you over your attire, which is none of her damned business, not pouring gasoline on your garden, not threatening the cops, not committing crimes twice in one month.

He asked if he should file for one and cops said well you can't.\n\nETA: they did say if he wants to file a report for harassment, the judge could order them to have no contact with the victim though. So that probably applies here.", "That actually never crossed my mind. I was thinking about digging the dirt out and replacing it with rocks. I gotta call and find out. Thank you!", "I\u2019ve been here two years and they\u2019re been quiet the entire time. Her first arrest was shocking for everyone and this happening shortly afterwards kinda makes me think maybe she\u2019s going through something? Maybe I should have just let my husband go over and handle it? Idk I just feel terrible for the children.", "She's probably just one of those miserable people who finds something to be pissed about no matter what it is. I hope she leaves you the hell alone.", "You might want to try and get a restraining order. Also a good fence may be of some help.", "Oooo so your neighbor is just hella jealous of your bodacious  self, it makes sense now.", "Keep records and receipts of everything you do\u2014 if this goes to court (or if you choose to sue), that will be important.", "If she was screaming at the cops, why wouldn't she start screaming at your husband? I think by calling the cops you avoided a tense and potentially dangerous situation for you and your husband. Stay safe.", "You did the right thing.  If she's going through something, let her tell that to the people who can do something about it.  It doesn't give her a pass to burn the neighborhood.", "Absolutely not. She was already displaying unhinged and dangerous behavior. Sending your husband over there would have been a recipe for disaster. She could have hurt him, thinking he wouldn\u2019t report it, or that he wouldn\u2019t be believed if he did. Or worse, she could have retaliated by striking a match and tossing it on your gas-soaked flower bed. You calling the police is the safest option for not just you and your husband, but the neighborhood. Now, there\u2019s a record of her harassment if/when she pulls something again. The neighbors defending her can f*ck right off.", "Another think is that I\u2019ve never not once seen her blinds open. So when exactly are the kids watching me bend over. I couldn\u2019t add it because of the character count but during our argument I told her that she should be teaching her sons not to stare at women and she took that horribly.", "She was just making stuff up to bolster her case.  Maybe she's jealous, maybe she's just mean!"]}
