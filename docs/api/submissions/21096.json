I have one flower bed on the side of my house that faces a bunch of windows on my neighbors house. This one flower bed for some reason gets A LOT of sedge grass in it but I can\u2019t spray any herbicide because my wildflowers are so dense. I spend a couple hours a week weeding the bed out by hand and don\u2019t squat to do it I just bend over. Two weeks ago my next door neighbor came out and told me that I need to stop wearing shorts and bending over with my a** to her house. I was kind of caught off guard and told her \u201cmy shorts aren\u2019t short so I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not mooning you\u201d. She then goes on about how she has sons and they don\u2019t need to see my a** when they look out the window and how they\u2019re a lot of older folks in our neighborhood who don\u2019t want to see me either. I got offended because my shorts are appropriate and I\u2019m friendly with the houses around, they have never said anything of the sort to me. Plus it\u2019s 100 plus degrees outside. I also let her know that I have a bad knee so I can\u2019t kneel/squat I bend because that\u2019s what most comfortable. We went back and fourth for a bit until I just wished her a good day and went back inside. I went to my husband and bent over in front of him and asked if he could see my butt from my short and he said no so I just kind of brushed the whole thing off until two days ago I went to go pluck my flower bed and wasn\u2019t bothered. like okay cool I\u2019m in the clear. But then the next morning I looked at my phone and saw a bunch of driveway camera notifications and when I went back to look at the videos this lady was like a movie villain with a gas can pouring liquid on my flower bed. I ran outside and yup.. I could smell the gasoline. I starting bawling. My husband came out to see why I bolted and was like \u201cis that gasoline?\u201d. I showed him the video and he wanted to go over and confront her as he was pissed off. Saying she could have killed us or set our house on fire but I didn\u2019t want to have another argument with this lady so we called to file a police report.  the cops came out and took the report. They told us pouring gas out is illegal and not just vandalism. After sitting outside our house for a while they went to go talk to her and chaos broke out. We could hear her yelling at the cops/threatening them and her kids crying. They called for backup and she was arrested. A bunch of our neighbors were standing outside watching this all go down and so we\u2019re we. Everyone was trying to figure out what happened and I told them about the gasoline and everyone was 50/50. One of the older ladies said that because she was arrested at her house a month ago her kids have already been through enough trauma and I added another event for them. And what if her kids get taken away (the dad is cool). It made me go from feeling like she deserved it to feeling guilty.", "created_utc": 1688252635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o8gjq/aita_for_getting_my_neighbor_arrested_after_she/", "score": 3564, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That logic is highly invalid and is used to try and justify people being AH and letting them get away with it because \"think of the children\" should be met with the remark of \"why, they aren't mine and it was their parent who decided to play a  stupid game, now they will win their stupid prize, actions have consequences.\"", "NTA - she played a stupid game and won a stupid prize", "You are NTA and you didn't get her arrested, her actions did.

The point is you are just a concerned and scared neighbor.", "NTA. It's hardly your fault that she keeps breaking the law and getting arrested.

It fills our pond, and when we're not in a drought, it occasionally runs down to cranky neighbors' house. It's been like that for at least the last 50 years, and they've hated it since they moved in 25 years ago.
