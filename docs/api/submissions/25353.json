My wife (33) and I were planning to go to the ceremony, as well as my parents, my brother and other sister, but one day before, we got a notification from Fanny that after the wedding we're invited to a reception in a restaurant at night, I asked Fanny if the invitation included my wife (we have a 2 years old child, but we're making arrangements to leave with my wife's mother for a hour or two) and she said that the reception was ONLY for her brothers and parents due the rushed event. Now I respect her decision, but I think that my wife and my brother's are also immediate family and must be included in that kind of family events, so the next day I went alone to the ceremony and refused to the reception for empathy with my wife.

I\u00b4m from South America, a \"latin man\" and in my culture, it\u00b4s habit that inmediate family means parents, siblings and their couples if they\u00b4re married or committed (uncles, cousins or grandparents aren\u00b4t a must). I don\u00b4t have a problem if this event were a common dinner or family meeting, but I believe that all family members and their couples must be considered as one in this kind of events, unless one of them has committed a terrible act or doesn\u00b4t get along with the groom/bride (that\u00b4s not the case here).\nThank you all for the nice comments until now.", "created_utc": 1692816649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zcun9/aita_for_refusing_an_invitation_because_my_wife/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA\u2026 good for you, for putting your foot down. \ud83d\udc4d", "Gonna go against the grain and say YTA I think people need to realize that yes husband and wife are family to each other but cmon logically and emotionally the fact is YOUR sister will always mean more to you than your WIFES sister. And for you sister her brother will always mean more to her than her spouses brother. Attending one event without your partner doesn\u2019t make you a bad husband, not always wanting your family\u2019s partners there also doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. Healthy couples are able to recognize their own individuality while still maintaining the fact that they are family. I think one of our society\u2019s failings is the expectation that husband and wife must do every single thing together as a pair without a sense of individuality. Your sister wanted the people she grew up with and who raised her there for her. It didn\u2019t have a deeper meaning bc she didn\u2019t invite anyone\u2019s spouse. Would it have really been so difficult to give that to her ? These made up rules by a society stating that a husband and wife must be constantly attatched at the hip has always confused me. There are situations where it IS fine if the partner isn\u2019t there and situations where it isn\u2019t. But in this case \u2026 she just wanted the people who\u2019d raised her there. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH congrats, if your goal was to have a relationship w ur sister you\u2019ve failed.

But you turned this into some personal slight that it just wasn\u2019t. Honestly, it can be really lovely to get some time with just the immediate family you grew up with and not all the partners who have entered the picture later. You missed the opportunity to celebrate with your sister because you took something personally that wasn\u2019t personal.

If you can't accommodate all your guests, you should just elope instead of having two tiers of guests."]}
