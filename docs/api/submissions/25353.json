And for you sister her brother will always mean more to her than her spouses brother. Attending one event without your partner doesn\u2019t make you a bad husband, not always wanting your family\u2019s partners there also doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. Healthy couples are able to recognize their own individuality while still maintaining the fact that they are family. I think one of our society\u2019s failings is the expectation that husband and wife must do every single thing together as a pair without a sense of individuality. Your sister wanted the people she grew up with and who raised her there for her. It didn\u2019t have a deeper meaning bc she didn\u2019t invite anyone\u2019s spouse. Would it have really been so difficult to give that to her ? These made up rules by a society stating that a husband and wife must be constantly attatched at the hip has always confused me. There are situations where it IS fine if the partner isn\u2019t there and situations where it isn\u2019t.

If your sis suddenly gets angry over it, then N T A. She could certainly have a valid reason for the short guest list. If this was all very rushed, probably the venue has a capacity limit or is a budget thing and she didn't want to ask for money for additional people.

I'm of Northern/Western European descent, and I was also raised that once a couple reach life partner status (which of course includes but is no longer limited to marriage), they start being treated as a unit.  Sure, you can and in fact should have siblings/cousins/friends days/nights/weekends, but for holidays, weddings etc., you invite both or neither.  Your sister and her spouse needed to make room for the two spouses, even if it took them to the next pricing level and they wanted to avoid that.  Your spouses come to any important events that you do now.", "YTA.  \nIf I understand your post correctly, no one\u2019s spouses were invited. So, she\u2019s treating everyone the same.

That ruined that friendship.", "NTA OP.  As others have commented, while your sister have the right to invite whom she wants, you have to right to decline because your wife wasn't invited; you were not in the wrong.  \n\nOMG, my brother and my SIL have been together 39 years (dated 4 years, married for 35 years) and she is just as much as family as if she was born from my Mama.  I could be spitting mad at her but I bet not not invite her to a function I give.  I would catch holy hell, not only from my brother but my Mom and other family members as well.  Now if it's about expenses, I would just tell my brother that he and SIL would have to share dinner, cause I'm broke \ud83d\ude09\ud83e\udd23 and he would totally understand (we've both been there, done that).", "NTA. Frankly its odd to celebrate your own marriage by excluding other people who have married into the family. At least the groom got to attend the dinner.

You said no, your mother tried to mildly convince you, you did not waiver, and that was the end of it.

It might have been a good opportunity to have you all together in that way and sometimes the vibe is different with just the sibs and parents.", "NTA but south american here too.

Is it understandable why that might not have come up with all the stress / rushes / etc.  Also (sadly) yes.  \n\n\nThen there is his side to factor in.  Working off a base math that his family is the same size as yours, the \"party\" is already married couple (2), 4 parents, 6 siblings, for a party of 12.  Decently hard for a restaraunt to accomodate \"last minute, sans reservations\".  Then toss up to 3 in-laws from his side's spouses, and your spouse, and now we have 16 - a size that becomes a burden on seating.  Thusly, again, due to the rushed nature, all in-laws were excluded from the immediate \"post wedding dinner\".  Again, could have been better communicated but...", "NTA. It is very rude to not invite a spouse to a wedding or similar event. You are right to refuse the invite.", "NTA\n\nIt's poor taste to have someone come to your wedding and not offer them food or drinks. And more so for couples. It's so weird that your wife should go to church/city hall for 30 minutes watch someone speak, and then be sent home when others proceed to dinner and party.", "NTA your a great husband for not going if your wife isn\u2019t going, respectful person you are sir.", "NTA\n\nI can't imagine wanting to attend a wedding or reception where my husband was excluded. If cost was the issue, I would even offer to cover the cost of him coming.\n\nWere any of your brothers wives/partners there? What members of Fanny's family were in attendance?", "It just reminded me of that irn bru advert where they named the baby fanny coming from a long line of Fannies \ud83d\ude02", "Ok", "No, it's not. \n\nA married couple are a social unit. If you are having an event to which both genders are invited, you invite them both. You can make exceptions if the spouse is an addict or abusive. That wasn't the case. \n\nSis wants to have people come celebrate her union while not respecting the unions of her two brothers. She is definitely TA.", "No, married couples can be invited to events that don't include that partners and it has nothing to do with gender. My family sometimes has family only dinners that don't include spouses. Sometimes mixed gender friend group has get togethers that don't include spouses.", "[deleted]", "They mean formal events, parties, stuff where other couples are invited, not one on one lunch.", "Hmm could be either lol", "INFO what initiated your question as to whether your wife was invited? I would have just assumed she was invited, what made you ask the question whether she was invited?", "NAH. Unless there's proof she's doing this maliciously. Maybe there is a cultural oversight (or an attempt to make a new family tradition?) but you have your values to hold on to, so you have the right to refuse to attend. And you didn't say anything about your sister being upset or anything, so maybe she's not fussed about this, or realized her error? \n\nMaybe it's a good idea to reach out to your sister and ask her why she didn't want spouses at the dinner, and let her know how you and your wife feel about this.", "NTA. Respect to you.", "INFO: How big was the wedding? It seems possible from your story that they only invited a small amount of family and friends in order to keep the size down. Given that this apparently involved last minute travel, cost also sounds like it could have been a concern. \n\nIf the wedding was just immediate family of the groom, immediate family of the bride, and a few close friends I think you are unreasonable in feeling snubbed. After all, it wasn't just your spouse that wasn't invited. If it was a big wedding that's a different story. But definitely not showing up at least for part of the reception is sure to negatively affect your relationship with your sister.", "So, you went to the ceremony alone but going to the reception alone was discrespectfull to your wife? Does not make too much sense...\n\nOverall NTA, because you can make your own decision about going or not...", "NTA, seems very strange behaviour to only invite one of you to the reception, if your sister had have only invited you to the ceremony I\u2019d have found it odd but maybe understandable if she wanted it super intimate, if she wanted a meal with just your blood family might have been nice to do that separately before the wedding", "Not really... \n\n\"Come celebrate my marriage!\"\n\n\"With my wife, right?\"\n\n\"No, fuck your marriage, celebrate MINE!\"\n\nNTA", "If that's the reasoning, the sister's husband shouldn't be there either", "It\u2019s pretty offensive in most parts of the world. Families get bigger - this idea of an impenetrable nuclear family is quite frankly weird - almost cultish. \n\nI also don\u2019t go to family weddings if my wife isn\u2019t invited. Our friends weddings have always included both of us fwiw. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not about keeping individuality etc - at a celebration of love and commitment, it makes sense to bring your own person in that same vein. It\u2019s not like this is his new girlfriend, it\u2019s his wife.", "I don't agree and I feel like it depends on the partner in question. Some people have shitty people they have picked as a partner. I have the right to not include them in a special day (wedding or otherwise) if I don't like or agree with them.", "I've seen kids named Fanny in Finland aswell. Always makes me chuckle.", "We have a movie called Fanny & Alexander \ud83d\ude00\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083922/"]}
