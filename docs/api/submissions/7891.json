That staff member\u2019s actions possibly mean that the school itself is now actively violating  ADA laws and potentially IDEA as it impacts your ability to discuss the education of the student with special needs.

I just wanted to be clear in that you were needing the accessible spot because of your mobility issues. That it wasn't a situation where husband has a card because his wife is disabled but uses it when she's not with him. Technically he COULD use it as it's assigned to his vehicle and he has a card saying he could use it but morally to me that would be wrong because he's perfectly able to walk from a regular spot.

I'm sorry but your comment warranted it.", "I would see it as something they should care about as it's important to enable people to do their tasks.

But requiring folks with limited mobility to get pics that ostensibly require good mobility is kind of garbage. Also, getting spotted taking pics can escalate some people. The system is still set up to give the benefit of the doubt to those who would trample on the rights of others. I hate it here more often than not", "Oh I've never even heard of that. I'm actually deaf with no inner ear function (no internal balance) so I've contemplated getting one at times but ultimately decided I'm not at a place where i actually need one (and no, I've never used them anyways). Good to know though if i ever get to that point.", "In my state, the standard is \u201ctransporting the person\u201d to whom the placard has been issued.

OMG you took the thoughts right out of my head. Like a lot of people will back into a spot against something when they know they don't have a placard or rear plate permit making their rear plate visible to the eye but nearly impossible to maneuver behind to get a photograph. The app requires front windshield, rear LP and a 3rd photo of the clear violation. When you're doing this from the app there's no way to discreetly do this and as you mentioned can lead to an escalation of events. If the person has extreme tint is higher profile vehicle and is parked in such a way you can't get those photos it's no use. Absolutely needs work.

Both sides of me completely blocked in, said family member not even able to get my wheelchair out and I was burning up. It took almost an hour and a half to get rescued in Albuquerque NM and I was becoming physically ill from the heat. The folks at the DMV told me it doesn't matter if I am exiting my vehicle or not that I should always ensure I can safely exit my vehicle when it's in park and that I should in fact always use the accessible spots in case of anything like that, a drained battery, alternator, or number of other issues that could leave me in a highly vulnerable situation.", "NTA for not wanting others to use it, but it could be argued that you don't need it in this case either. You have a placard because you qualify for one, but you're not leaving your car. So you're using the handicapped spot so your able bodied child doesn't have to walk as far.", "You think someone would be willing to go to prison over a parking spot? They wouldn't make it far if they did.", "You think someone would be willing to go to prison over a parking spot? They wouldn't make it far if they did.", "If you tell media a staff member was abusing it they will definitely be on it.", "That doesn't stop unhinged people from hurting other people.  Not worth it.", "You're probably right, as humorous as the idea itself would be the sad reality is, there are too many unhinged people that have access to more than just our accessible parking if you catch my drift. I hear what you're saying and appreciate the concern so I will ease your mind and promise you that I will not do this as funny as I thought it might be at first, you made some valid points. Thank you.", "NTA stand up for acessability parking people everywhere steal those spots even when there are none available\nHandicapped people earn (for lack of a better word) those places by being handicapped ourselves.", "NTA keep calling the non-emergency number until the comply. Sooner or later they will have to enforce the parking. Blessings OP", "Accessible parking is to make life accessible to those of us who need accommodation. It\u2019s NOT for able bodied people to get a better parking spot. Those are our ONLY options, they don\u2019t need EVERY option. It\u2019s not \u201cpriority parking\u201d it\u2019s equity for disability. NTA", "I will keep fighting so hopefully my community is more friendly to future human beings living with disabilities and mobility limitations.", "Thank you I will keep calling and even make sure there are enforcements in place via the city and also through a formal complaint to comply or be taken to court.", "This is a cause near and dear to me and people that I love and care about so I will most definitely keep up this fight. Thank you for your words of encouragement. They mean so much to me.", "In my state you go to the doctor they fill out a form you take it to department of motor vehicle registration and they issue you the permits 2 to them at no charge linked to your DL number. However if you want the plate, it's one plate at an additional cost... it's more convenient to most people in my state to get the placard permits as you can use them in whichever vehicle you are in. I'm not sure how every state runs their program but I do know in a handful of states that I've lived in that was generally the process.", "Also start filming and sending it to local news. Especially the staff member. If you get the word out enough, the school board will probably want it to stop as soon as you start it. So just take it very public and let it be known that they have done nothing and even starting doin the same thing you complained about. That should help. You can also send the video to the local police station, or sheriff\u2019s office. Sheriff\u2019s are usually elected and pointing that it can help light the fire they need.", "Call the school principal/superintendent/board and treaten a lawsuit", "This is the process in my state as well. I did not have to pay for mine and in my state I do not have to pay for parking.", "I was really aiming for this with the social media aspect of it. I know some people don't understand why I'd use social media but sometimes the power of social media is astronomical.", "I think if I start threatening lawyers they will just direct me to their lawyers. However I'm not above having them served with a letter from an attorney if all else fails this next week.", "I hope to be there when they start nabbing them for it too", "1. I do exit my car on most days\n2. I'm in a wheelchair and can't exit or enter my vehicle when it's not accessible\n3. I've been trapped in non accessible parking spots when I had unexpected car trouble leading to dangerous situations\n4. I have had my car blocked in by people and unable to leave area for hours on end.\n5. Accessibility needs are for me (disabled person) to determine if I need it not the general public\nSo am I really the AH?", "Make sure to get video, for posterity. \ud83d\ude0f", "I can think of a few people that I know who are willing to go to prison because they are so convinced that they are right and righteous, so I don't fuck with other people like that. Not worth it."]}
