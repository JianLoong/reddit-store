We were best friends from 4th grade until 10th when she moved away. We kept in contact.\n\nThen she got pregnant in college by a boyfriend (Never married).

He also lives several states away. They did not work out, obviously, and they didn't last until she gave birth.\n\nWe started dating 2 years after the break up and have now been together for almost 3 years. All was good until I popped the question (she said yes!). News got to her ex a few days later(yesterday) and he sends us both text to the effect of him setting a \"hard boundary\" of how his daughter cannot be alone with me for any reason because he \"doesn't know what kind of man I am,\" and \"doesn't feel comfortable with her being around a complete stranger.\"\n\nKeep in mind in the last three years he has seen her less than a months worth of time, can go weeks without calling, and rarely sends the court ordered child support on time, if at all, or the full amount.\n\nWhere I have been providing for his daughter daily for over 4 years now (before my fianc\u00e9e and I officially started dating). They have lived with me for some time now as well (which he knew about and was fine with) with no issues. His daughter sees me more of dad than him at this point. This text came after several weeks of not contacting on his part.\n\nNow, all of a sudden, I can't be trusted. Like the last 4-5 years never happened? How is it in the best interest of his daughter?\n\n\u00a0I/we have not responded yet, I don't know how to without going scorched earth.\n\nTLDR; My fianc\u00e9es baby dad came up with a \"hard boundary\" where I can't be alone with his daughter anymore.
