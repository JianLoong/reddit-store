I (23f) have 2 sisters. Amanda (31f) and Cecil (28f). Amanda has been with her husband for 4 years and they have been engaged since last year. I have never liked Amandas husband as he says that he believes that women are less worth than men. Amanda says that Ivan (her husband,54m) was just being \"himself\". Amanda and Ivan have benn planning their wedding since november last year and the wedding took place about 2 weeks ago. At the wedding there was about 200-300 people including both the groom's and the bride's family, friends and their friends. I arrived pretty early to help with all decorations and put out food. Ivan was sitting down looking at his phone while me, my mum, Cecil, and my aunts were decorating and welcoming people. After about half an hour we were done and almost all guests had come and sat down in their seats. Amanda was ready and just waiting as everyone else. I told Ivan that he needs to stand up and wait for Amanda. He then stood up like he was going to wait for Amanda to walk up with my dad up the ailse. But that isn't what he did, he stood up, looked me in the eyes and told me,in these exact words \"You shouldn't care so much, this isn't your wedding and you will never have one. No-one loves you and never will because you are a woman, you will die alone in your one bedroom apartment while I am having s*x with my wife\" and also, there were LITERAL CHILDREN in the front rows of the venue! Like children aged 5-15 year old! I stared at him in shock and so did everyone else, including Amanda. I took my purse and stormen off. Amanda stoppas me and asked where I was going and I told her that I would be staying at a hotel in the area. She asked me why and iasked if it wasn't obvious. She said that I was being an a**hole because I got mad at Ivan for such a small misunderstanding. I laughed at her and drove away to a hotel close to the venue. My phone has been going off with messages from family members since then, but not a single text from Ivan. Most of The texts are people comforting me and siding with me but Amanda, Cecil and my own mother have been telling me things like \"don't act like it isn't true\" and \"you shouldn't have left you are an a**hole\". I really do not know what to do now.
