{"id": 26625, "submission_id": "16fgfq6", "title": "AITA for expecting my sister to let our autistic brother move in with her as I own her house?", "selftext": "6 years ago, myself and 3 of my brothers bought my sister a house to live in rent free. She has had issues with homelessness in the past and as she has lots of children it was important for us to give her a safe place to live. She lives there with four of her 9 kids. 3 of them are still minors (17M, 13F, 12M) but the fourth is her 28 year old autistic son. The house originally had four bedrooms but we renovated the basement to add 3 more a few years ago.\n\nWhen we bought the house for her we had several stipulations including that once it was no longer possible for our autistic brother to live with our grandpa he would then live with her. At the time she agreed. She is already one of our brothers main caregivers and he spends a lot of time at her house.\n\nA few weeks ago, our grandpa began discussing with my siblings and I about our brothers living situation. Grandpa's almost 90 now and feels as though he can no longer cope with our brother.\n\nOne of my brothers visited our sister last week and mentioned about our brother moving in with her and she told him that maybe we should discuss other plans for his living arrangements (essentially with one of us or in a home). My brother left the conversation there but later let me know what she said.\n\nI called her and she explained she doesn't think her autistic son and our autistic brother should be living together because they clash a little and have different needs.\n\nIt's true they don't always like each other and I myself have seen the meltdowns they have sent each other into. But they have both adjusted to things we previously thought they wouldn't in the past and they would probably get used to each others presence in the long run. 95% of the time they get on fine it's only when they both can't get their way that they freak out. I think they benefit from being around each other as they both have to grow a little.\n\nThey also do actually like each others company some of the time and have lots of positive interactions. My sister doesn't even want to consider a trial run of bro living with her and is basically giving a flat out no. If we tried it and it didn't work we could find a different solution, but it feels like she's just making excuses.\n\nI did bring up our previous agreement and she practically called my bluff implying she doesn't think I would kick her out because of the her kids living with her. I told her I would.\n\nSeveral of my siblings did not like that I said this (even though I was bluffing a little) and my other sister just generally thinks we're cruel for trying to \"force\" her into taking our brother (but didn't offer to take him herself). For various reasons none of our other siblings can really house/care for him. She knows how to look after him, has the space, has the time (doesn't work), and is probably the only other person he would happily live with.

If he's independent enough to work, he can probably contribute to thinking of solutions.\n\nAnyway, you need to be talking with mental health professionals and people who know the whole situation, not asking strangers if they think you're an arsehole.", "Hmm, I don\u2019t understand the YTAs.

To me that suggests having him at home is difficult. \n\nWhy would she agree to a trial run when there's a possibility you would just leave him there?\n\nI understand you made your expectations clear, but she was homeless and in a difficult spot, of course she said yes. Caring for someone with autism until their death on top of potentially having their own son live with them permanently is a lot to expect of someone \n\nThis is a hell of a lot more complicated than a simple Reddit post", "It's sad, but maybe a home would be best for him if no one in the family wants to.

She cannot expect your family to continue to provide free housing for her and her kids in addition to your brother if it is separately.  I think all these YTAs don't have a concept of how expensive these costs will be to the other siblings.  I'm guessing they can't afford to do both simultaneously when they've been helping her for six years instead of their savings.", "Lemme ask you question: \nWas you\u2019re homeless sister with multiple children and being an autistic caregiver supposed to say NO to the house? \n\nWas that a reasonable reality for you?

She is already caring for one autistic adult that needs care and supervision. Now you want to add your brother into the household, who also has issues and needs a caregiver. \n\nIf her son and your brother have issues with each other and meltdowns are involved, do you think it's fair to your sister? Why is she responsible for most of his care, and now has to take on 24/7 caregiving? Do you think that is a fair thing to do to one sibling? None of the rest of you want him and sounds very convenient to dump that on your sister because of something she agreed to a long time ago. You know you can cause this household to become explosive and potentially dangerous to anyone living there, including your brother.\n\nI think this is pretty selfish. Do you and your other siblings plan to take your brother regularly to give your sister respite? I realize that it was generous to buy her a house, but damn if I was practically homeless with my kids I would promise anything for a safe home.

In Ohio there is also a \u201cshared living\u201d option where the caregiver gets a daily stipend to cover the costs of an individual with developmental disabilities.

But I noticed that OP mentioned that he bought the house with 3 of his brothers, implying that there are more. That means that they are at least five siblings, which leads me to conclude that sister has had 9 kids in a family culture that expects women to have loads of children and probably don\u2019t agree to birth control. Which leads me to think that her having 9 children shouldn\u2019t be judged as some moral lacking in the sister or the assumption that she could\u2019ve just stopped having kids. \n\nSo she doesn\u2019t have a job and couldn\u2019t afford housing, with her 9 kids and full time carer responsibilities for two autistic adults?

She has had issues with homelessness in the past and as she has lots of children it was important for us to give her a safe place to live. She lives there with four of her 9 kids. 3e of them are still minors (17M, 13F, 12M) but the fourth is her 28 year old autistic son. The house originally had four bedrooms but we renovated the basement to add 3 more a few years ago. \n\nWhen we bought the house for her we had several stipulations including that once it was no longer possible for our autistic brother to live with our grandpa he would then live with her. At the time she agreed. She is already one of our brothers main caregivers and he spends a lot of time at her house.\n\nA few weeks ago, our grandpa began discussing with my siblings and I about our brothers living situation. Grandpa's almost 90 now and feels as though he can no longer cope with our brother.\n\nOne of my brothers visited our sister last week and mentioned about our brother moving in with her and she told him that maybe we should discuss other plans for his living arrangements (essentially with one of us or in a home). My brother left the conversation there but later let me know what she said.\n\nI called her and she explained she doesn't think her autistic son and our autistic brother should be living together because they clash a little and have different needs. \n\nIt's true they don't always like each other and I myself have seen the meltdowns they have sent each other into. But they have both adjusted to things we previously thought they wouldn't in the past and they would probably get used to each others presence in the long run. 95% of the time they get on fine it's only when they both can't get their way that they freak out. I think they benefit from being around each other as they both have to grow a little.\n\nThey also do actually like each others company some of the time and have lots of positive interactions.  \nMy sister doesn't even want to consider a trial run of bro living with her and is basically giving a flat out no. If we tried it and it didn't work we could find a different solution but it feels like she's just making excuses.\n\nI did bring up our previous agreement and she practically called my bluff implying she doesn't think I would kick her out because of the her kids living with her. I told her I would. \n\nSeveral of my siblings did not like that I said this (even though I was bluffing a little) and my other sister just generally thinks we're cruel for trying to \"force\" her into taking him. However, for various reasons none of our other siblings can really house/care for him. She knows how to look after him, has the space, has the time (doesn't work), and is probably the only other person he would happily live with. AITA for expecting her to live up to our deal so our brother doesn't have to move into a home?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Neither of you are assholes, you did make a deal, however she still brings up a good point based on previous experiences. Both of you are trying to do the right thing but have a different idea, maybe neither of you are wrong and maybe you both are. Having her own autistic son along with other children is a stressful situation by itself, along side the fact that they (your brother and her son) don't always get along and can lead to meltdowns, even with a house provided to her. But you did (do?) provide her with the house. I think there needs to be a sit down discussion between you and your sister, and probably your brothers, and determine what could be your best course of action would be given everyone's current circumstances, not based on deals made 6 years ago with different circumstances.", "Esh \nYour sister for having that many children she can\u2019t support and taking advantage of her siblings. \nYou for thinking it\u2019s an ok environment for your brother and allowing him to be cared for by a 90year old.\n\nFrankly she either needs to buy you out or you sell the property to fund the care for your brother.

You say that the eldest and your brother get along 95% of the time and would get along eventually in the long run. What if they don't? What happens then? \n\nAt some point, your sister isn't going to be able to meet his care needs, so a home will be inevitable if no one else will take him in.", "ESH\nYour brother is difficult to live with.  Your sister has correctly identified that he and her son will either be painful living together or dangerous to each other.

What would you do then?", "caring for a autistic son plus 3 teenager is hard enough even without another person that needs care. and your brother and nephew send each other into meltdowns. that sounds like a receipt for desaster. i can see why your brothers and sisters say your are TA. because YTA", "What?

I understand you want to take care of your brother, but you also have a sister. It's not a position, I'd like to be in. Maybe give her a reasonable time to find a new place, sell the house for group care? But yes, it is cruel to kick kids out. Yeah, unless you hate your nephews/niece, it makes sense. In my country there are a lot of financial help for people who can't function on their own. Did you look at that? Here they pay for the group living.", "Tricky. She's putting the needs of her son first, so I can't really blame her for not wanting him to move in.", "YTA\n\nYour sister has 9 kids which four of them live with her including her own son with autism and now you want her to take care is your brother who also has autism and you know they clash when things don\u2019t go their way.

Let me guess, the rest of the family can\u2019t possibly help because they have jobs and kids of their own. Yes it was nice of you guys to buy a house for your struggling sister and nieces/nephews. But the conditions you have attached to that are unreasonable and makes the whole gesture one that benefits you in the long run because you have an indentured slave to deal with your autistic brother. You\u2019re poor sister doesn\u2019t even get the opportunity to turn her life around, perhaps get a job and gain some independence. Even pay you back so she doesn\u2019t owe you. She has been relegated to the family carer now that your poor 90 year old grandfather can no longer manage. Wow, just wow. And yes, there was a verbal agreement that your brother will move in sometime. She would have made this agreement under duress, is no longer in survival mode so can finally start making progress, and you want to hold her to this? She agreed that he could move in, not that she be responsible for him for the rest of her life. If you have to move him in, then provide him with a carer. I\u2019m sure your sister would appreciate the help considering what she has on her plate. She might be able to get a job, pay rent, help her kids, move upwards in her life. There is zero chance of that if you kick her out or maker her responsible for your brother. It sounds like she\u2019s had a tough life compared to the rest of you, giver her a chance to make some progress.", "I might get downvoted for this but I will still go with YTA. You practically blackmailed your sister! She was homeless with children when you offered her a house. Of course she would agree on anything to get of the street with her children and you all used that against her!

When she agreed it would be okay for him to move in in the future was it also stipulated that she would become his caregiver 24/7? If it wasn\u2019t stipulated she would become his caregiver then YTA big time. You\u2019re already kinda TA in my opinion for giving her an ultimatum on a house you and your other siblings bought together for her without consulting any of them. AND for threatening your nieces/nephews with homelessness just bc she\u2019s not doing what you want at this moment in time. That seems like a very harsh 0-100 mentality. \n\nSecondly: Your sister is already taking care of one dependent adult and if they send each other into meltdowns you are most likely setting them all up for a very strained and potentially dangerous home environment without even taking into consideration her other kids that live with her. I understand that she needs to uphold her end of the deal but if the deal was that he could live there and this was decided upon before it was known that her autistic son and your autistic bro don\u2019t get along then I understand why she\u2019s hesitant. Also if the deal was he could move in but you\u2019re also expecting her to become a full time caregiver as well then you need to check yourself and your motives. Why did you think you could give her such an huge ultimatum without consulting the OTHER people who have invested in what happens in this situation? How independent are both of them? When you say meltdowns is it ever physical? Are you and your other siblings going to step up and take care of your brother at times so she can get a break? Having a dependent adult with you 24/7 no matter how independent they are can be incredibly tough, especially mentally.\n\n I think it\u2019s fair to be upset that your plan isn\u2019t going seamlessly into place and you\u2019re struggling to find a place for your autistic bro but have you discussed the plan over the years besides that one time or did you just expect everything to be nice and tidy after one discussion years ago?", "Is there a way to make the downstairs it\u2019s own living quarters and have your brother live downstairs with a care taker?  \n\nIn that way the boys could socialize when they are up to it, but be separated when it gets overwhelming?", " I am unclear about how it would work having 2 autistic adults who mostly don't like each other live in the same house without proper medical care and supervision.  for 2 adults with autism, you will need to have someone help manage their care, If you evict your sister and her autistic child out who will look after your brother.

It will be no good to anyone if your brother goes to live there and your sister burns out being the only carer for two autistic adults who set off each others meltdowns combined with the care of her other minor children.

The fact they adapted to some stuff better than you thought doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen this time. Your sister has a right of prioritizing her son over your sibling.

If she has been working there would have needed to be a paid carer involved which over 6 years would have probably cost at least $300,000 so her not working is a fallacy", "Her son is high functioning. He even has a job. \n\nThe brother is lower functioning and she\u2019s already taking care of him. Just not in her home.", "Yes and things sound like things have changed.

She is already over capacity taking care of one autistic child and she 3 others - which likely impacts her ability to work. \n\nShe is allowed to change what she thinks is and isn\u2019t appropriate for her child in her own home and just because OP is **partial** owner of the house doesn\u2019t entitle him to dictate her entire life or threaten to throw her on the street if she doesn\u2019t comply.", "Which is why I asked.

And why haven\u2019t they already been doing that? That would make things 100x easier for all parties involved rather than just trying to make one person do all the heavy lifting. \n\nNow OP is not inherently wrong for making rules about a property he owns but it definitely sounds like he\u2019s trying to use it as a way to wash his hands clean of any responsibility to the brother which is a mistake. Like it or not he will *probably* have to chip in for his care at some point. And as someone who\u2019s only sibling has issues very similar to autism and will bear almost all responsibility one day, I can\u2019t understand how someone who has four times the amount of manpower to help can\u2019t figure out a more practical solution, if the care of the autistic sibling is something that\u2019s truly at stake here. \n\nEdit: make that five times the amount of manpower since he has two sisters.", "They have 7 bedrooms in the house, with 4 currently occupied. The siblings will also likely chip together and hire a caregiver to assist with the household tasks and situations(im sure he recieves disability benefits, and since this would be rent free, his check could easily pay for the majority of the expense if not all of it)", "I think you're confused, the comment you're replying to never said they didn't plan it with the sister before. \n\nWhat I think your replying to was them saying that when the brother went to talk to the sister they should have all been on the same page, so that the brother could have said then and there, that their deal was due and she has to watch the brother or leave.", "TL;DR: KezarLake was not incorrect. Below, Kezar8 made an excellent reply before I did, and far better than I did, but theirs wasn't in reply to yours so I made my own.\n\n> **She is already one of our brothers main caregivers and he spends a lot of time at her house.**\n\nSo here's the count, besides taking care of herself: 3 minors, 1 autistic adult kid, 1 disabled brother that wasn't part of the initial discussion. That's five people. OP & brothers knew about her kids when giving her the house. Now sister is taking care of one of their other siblings too. And OP wants to add another person to that list.\n\n> **I called her and she explained she doesn't think her autistic son and our autistic brother should be living together because they clash a little and have different needs.**\n\nThat's correct. Autistic people are not identical robots. Some of them have very different needs. At the bottom of OP's post, OP says sister already \"knows how to look after him\" (their autistic brother). So who was taking care of their autistic brother? The credit went to their 90 year old daddy dearest, so either OP was lying about who did the care of the autistic brother or OP thinks taking care of autistic people is easy and all autistic people are the same. But since only the sister can take care of the autistic brother now, I guess OP can't think it's easy, right? And since daddy-doo is 90, who's going to take care of him? Someone who wants an inheritance? Or the sister again? \ud83d\udc40 \n\n> **and I myself have seen the meltdowns they have sent each other into.**\n\nWhat? OP *just said* the two autistic adults \"clash a little\". Does OP mean to say that meltdowns are a \"little\" clash? OP appears to be ignorantly/intentionally minimizing what's going on.\n\n> **But they have both adjusted to things we previously thought they wouldn't in the past and they would probably get used to each others presence in the long run. 95% of the time they get on fine it's only when they both can't get their way that they freak out.**\n\nIt's wonderful that they've been able to adjust to things in the past, but that isn't a guarantee for every situation. Especially when the full-time caretaker (which is mentioned below) for five other people - including two disabled adults! - is saying it's not a good idea. Trust her. All this time OP left sister to do the work and gain the knowledge, therefore, between them sister is the expert. OP is judging from the sidelines like corporate who's rarely there saying the store is fully staffed on four people on electronics all day. Just because two apparently severely autistic adults get along 95% of the time ***while visiting*** doesn't mean it will be the same when they're living together 24/7.\n\n> **it's only when they both can't get their way that they freak out.**\n\nOP is now giving off ableist vibes.\n\n> **They also do actually like each others company some of the time and have lots of positive interactions.**\n\nThat's wonderful when they visit, which is not the same as them living with each other. Living together is more difficult than visiting even for non-disabled adults... If they weren't so autistic as to need a full-time caregiver for their needs, then sure, OP's explanation would make sense, but since each of the autistic adults need a full-time caregiver then they are disabled. And disabled people are harder to take care of than non-disabled persons.\n\n> **Several of my siblings did not like that I said this (even though I was bluffing a little)**\n\nI'm not surprised. Here we can see that OP is minimizing again. \"Bluffing a little\"? About evicting someone? OP was either bluffing or they were not bluffing, there's no inbetween considering the topic and the conversation OP had. OP is apparently trying to look like the good guy. Well, I'm not surprised that OP's siblings weren't happy with OP's threats of making their sister homeless. What was it OP said earlier? That OP and the brothers bought the house *together* so that sister wouldn't face homelessness and would have a safe place to live.\n\n> **And my other sister just generally thinks we're cruel for trying to \"force\" her into taking our brother (but didn't offer to take him herself).**\n\nClearly OP is very judgemental about anyone who disagrees with them.\n\n> **For various reasons none of our other siblings can really house/care for him.**\n\nOP has talked a lot about this one particular sister and disparaged her while she's already taking care of another disabled brother (where's OP in that?) on top of her three minors and her disabled son (all of which OP & brothers knew about while giving her a house) and the expectation of taking care of this brother too. I have a feeling that OP is either jealous of or OP really does not like their sister. Was the sister adopted or was this sister an affair baby or something? And why can't OP help take care of their siblings? Maybe trade the autistic one for the one sister is already caring for, if that's what OP prefers?\n\n(part 1/2, continued)", "It wouldn\u2019t be his son.

Reddit is usually the first to say that your life can't be put on hold for what your parents did. \n\n> Second, for not discussing with your brothers about how to handle the situation, making sure everyone was on the same page, and approaching your sister as an united front.\n\nAccording to this, OP needed to have already formulated a plan and been ready to effectively communicate it before his brother opened his big yapper and sprouted out some dumb crap. That is impetus to put on somebody (who likely is still having to work, being the breadwinner) doing a major task before a stupid can stupid. That's unrealistic, and a stupid nit to pick.\n\n> Third, for your sister having kids she can\u2019t support and reneging on the deal.\n\nThis is the only asshole here because the stipulations were written out.

I guess they should just fork over the cash for another place to live, because everyone knows how easy that is now. Easy to say OP hates his sister when you ignore that. \n\nYea, it's not ideal. But this is family, and they went out of their way to try and take care of each other. The agreement was that this place was for brother too, and now she's cutting him loose despite the fact that they went out of their way for here.\n\nYou can throw labels and blame around, but that is some bullshit. Pretending otherwise is deceitful. She agreed to take a home when she needed it, but now that it's time to pay the piper she's too busy with her own mistakes to hold up her end. She took their money, she ate on their dime, now they can't afford to take care of brother so what's going to happen to him?\n\nShe doesn't care, and you're making excuses. Fuck that. She deserves to be on the street more than the brother does, but she would send him there without a care.", "> **She knows how to look after him, has the space, has the time (doesn't work), and is probably the only other person he would happily live with.**\n\nSo, essentially, OP thinks this way: sister already knows how to take care of unwanted brother, because she's the only one who ~~learned how to~~ can, and because they bought her a house while knowing all about her kids and autistic son, which means now no one else has to learn how to take care of autistic brother, and why would they? They gave her a house, after all. Oh and she doesn't work anyway - because doing daily housework of an entire house, plus taking care of three kids, plus taking care of her disabled son, plus taking care of another disabled brother, plus probably cooking for everyone, isn't work - so *obviously* that means she has time to take care of a third disabled adult. OP probably bets sister has all day to herself, right? Or that it's easy and it's somehow not work because sister is a woman? Besides, OP and brothers pooled together to buy and give sister a house, so that means OP owns it and is going to make sure they get every drop of blood for every cent out of sister. OP will take it away if sister doesn't ~~do what OP says~~ keep her word. And sister always has a choice: be overworked for life bEcAuSe FaMiLy aNd a fReE HoUsE, or be homeless with three minors and a disabled son. It's not OP's fault that sister had 9 kids and one of them is disabled (even though that was part of the reason they gave her a house)! Why can't OP be honest? There wasn't much concern for sister's safety. It's really just a return on an investment that OP was looking for. And clearly the sister might be the only one of them that autistic brother would be happy to live with, because the rest of the siblings ~~don't want him~~ can't do it for various reasons! Not even OP! And why pay for him to get specialized care? Gotta make good on the money for the house after all. Sister is already taking care of five other people including one who wasn't part of the deal, what's one more? It's not like sister has a *job* with a *paycheck*.\n\nHonestly, I found it funny how OP's title said it was a house they own, but in the post OP said it was a purchase made by them _and_ their brothers. I guess they mistakenly put it in OP's name. Give a house, get a lifetime live-in maid who should be grateful for the roof over her head while they can keep sending their ~~unwanted~~ disabled siblings to her.\n\nI may have been too aggressive with this post.

There are literally so many stories on here about just one, maybe two siblings who will have to assume all care of an autistic or otherwise disabled person once the parents pass it\u2019s literally ridiculous that a family with six siblings, easily four to five times the amount of people in most other cases, are still trying to figure out how to make it so that it\u2019ll be just one person who has to do the brunt of the work. When by just rotating the brother among the six of them they can easily face far less burnout or other complications than  most other people with that responsibility. And not have to worry about living center costs. \n\nOP isn\u2019t TA for making rules about his own property but to me this reads a ways more about him just not wanting to be on the hook to have to be any kind of caretaker for his brother.
