We grew up very close and I see her as more of a sister than my aunt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so I'm pretty sure I'm the asshole but I want to see other people's opinions. I graduated high school at 16 years old and I am currently in college while working a part-time job. I do my schooling online, and I recently moved in with my grandparents because of an ongoing issue with my mother. My aunt Kate 21f (not her real name) lives with them and so does my uncle Sam (25m). I have always been super inspired by Kate and Sam growing up because of how smart the two of them are. Sam goes to a very good college and is getting a degree in engineering. Kate graduated top of her class with an AA and was accepted into a very good college as well. She dropped out the first semester and never went back. She also had a job at one point but quit it for no reason and hasn't had one since. She also blew all of her money and now spends her days milling around the house watching tv. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. She graduated high school with a fucking college degree!! That's insane! And now, she does nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other day we were talking about how hard college is and I asked her if she was planning to go back. She said no. I asked if she was going to get another job. She said no because she doesn't like working for people. I asked her how she expected to earn money and she just shrugged and said my grandmother would pay for her. So I said something like \"But you're 21. Aren't you embarrassed that you're turning out to be a failure?\" I probably shouldn't have been so blunt, but I always get so angry when I think about how she's wasting her potential. She is one of the smartest people I know but she won't get off her ass. Instead, she's making her mom buy her tickets to anime conventions and chauffer her around the city because she doesn't even have a fucking driver's license either. I told her I was disappointed that she dropped out of college and was doing nothing with her life and she just shrugged it off and excused herself. The walls are pretty thin and I heard her crying in the bathroom. I barely felt bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI already know I am not a very empathetic person. Considering how other people may feel before I say something has always been an issue of mine. I think I'm the asshole because I've already come up with so many reasons as to why she hasn't gone back to school. I just simply don't care because she's not living up to the standards I've set for her in my head. This is shitty of me, right? She's gonna be 22 soon and she's doing nothing with her life. By her age, I'm going to have a bachelor's degree. Damn. She's just so smart, why is she doing this? Anyway, she won't talk to me now. I don't blame her.

Probably.\n\nSometimes it is important to be the AH. A service to others. Accepting AH designation to help others see themselves more clearly. You might be this kind of AH.\n\nOr maybe, your aunt had a horrible traumatic experience at college, and is still in active trauma over it, and you just punched the bruise. Like maybe she was assaulted by a member of college staff, someone in a position of trust. Maybe she is just trying to keep it together and avoid any anxiety inducing circumstances. You wouldn't know, and you don't have many ways to ask.\n\nI hope you make up with each other, and that whatever shunted her life from fast-track over-achiever to NEET gets processed and resolved some day.", "Your conscience drove you to post this because you know you\u2019re in the wrong, yes. \n\nIf I said something cruel to a family member and heard them crying in the bathroom because of it I would never forgive myself. If you want to push her, why not use encouragement as opposed to criticism? \n\nI recognize you\u2019re still a minor, so I need to take that into account. But you\u2019re an unkind person at this point in your life, so how does it feel to be a failure in terms of humanity?", "YTA.  You sound pretty judgmental along with your lack of empathy.  It sounds like you put her on a pedestal and always compared yourself to her that the minute you felt like you had a better situation, you tore her down.  This makes you an AH.  People don\u2019t just do 180\u2019s for no reason, likely something happened or maybe she\u2019s just burned out.  I tested gifted and school always came easy; although I didn\u2019t graduate with a degree, I had 36 credits with a bunch being college courses.  I could\u2019ve walked into a degree, but I didn\u2019t go to college.  I was extremely burned out (not to mention dealing with my own traumas), but I found my way through other means.  Everyone\u2019s path in life is different and people learn and achieve things at their own speed.", "Saying cruel things to people, such as calling them failures, because hey, you're pretty sure it's true, doesn't make it any less cruel.  \n\nBut what if the person isn't living up to your high standards?  Still cruel.  \n\nWhat if they aren't living the life you think they ought to be leading? Still cruel.  \n\nWhat if you tried to get them to lead the life you think they ought to lead, but they refused?  Still cruel.\n\nBeing academically successful and being a good person are not necessarily related.  You are clearly doing very well in the academic success department, but being able to explain clearly why you were cruel does not justify the cruelty.\n\nYTA.  Do better.", "Soft YTA. I see your concerns but you never know what's going on in people's lives. She might have a good reason not to go back to college which she's not telling you about.", "I wasn\u2019t gonna comment but YTA, you never know how someone\u2019s feeling. You NEVER know. She\u2019s probably silently suffering and you made it so much worse. I don\u2019t care that you aren\u2019t an empathetic person, that was completely uncalled for. Words hurt people. EDIT: the more I re read the post the more I feel like you have too much of an ego. Sometimes life doesn\u2019t work out the way you want. Humble yourself, apologize to your aunt. YTA still, but this is still fixable.", "YTA. I get it, you're young, and you think that it should be an easy and logical road -- graduate high school with a college degree then go to college and get more of an education, then get a good job, yadda yadda. Unfortunately life doesn't always go exactly according to plan. She could have burned out. Being incredibly smart and accomplished at a young age does not guarantee you'll stay on that route or find a career you're interested in so young. She may truly not enjoy college -- possibly forever, or possibly just not right now -- she needs to find something she can be passionate about or at least interested in enough to pursue. Goin to college as soon as you graduate college isn't the best way for all young people. She may have had something bad happen to her to made her need to take a break, or perhaps she has some mental health issues. Twenty-two may feel \"old\" to you at 17, but I assure you that it is still very young. It's okay that she doesn't have it all figured out right now. Hopefully she'll get it together and find her way, but she is by no means a failure and it was callous and short-sighted of you to say that to her. It's not her job to be your role model forever.", "YTA, you\u2019re being unkind to your aunt for no good reason.

You don't want to see her suffering later in life. It's normal to be concerned about family but your language was too harsh.

Apologize and try some other ways to bring her back to being productive.", "YTA\n\nYou never know whats going on in someones life, youre still a kid and you dont get to make judgement calls on someones life when you arent even out of highschool, you yourself might end up like her. apologize and think about what youll say next time. do better.", "YTA  \nIt's her life, not yours. You do not get to call someone a failure just because they're not living up to the expectations you set for them.", "YTA\n\nTry supporting her instead of insulting her and making things worse.  \n\nFrom her reaction I expect there are probably very good reasons for her situation at the moment.  It may not be apparent and possibly none of your business either but this is a time for empathy rather than tough love.  \n\nGo and apologise and see if she wants to talk.", "You\u2019re not wrong that she\u2019s not currently living up to her potential but YTA for sure. \nI know that you\u2019re a teenager but 21 isn\u2019t old \ud83d\ude44 Plenty of people don\u2019t have all their ducks in a row at that point in their life, you also don\u2019t know what she may have gone through that lead to her sort of dropping out of life all of a sudden - if nothing else it sounds like she may have depression, which effects your motivation enormously. \nLong story short, cut the people you love some slack, lest they turn around and tell you that you\u2019re a failure at being a decent human being with the ability to feel compassion for others. \ud83d\ude12\n\n(I also think it\u2019s hilarious that you\u2019re so sure that in X years you\u2019re going to be in X position in life. \nKiddo, you have no idea how the real world actually works and one day life might just hit you like a ton of bricks.)", "I want to offer you some advice. \n\nYou sound like a logical person who wants to understand other people even though you're not naturally empathetic. Here's a way to do that:\n\nWhen people do things that don't make sense, think of it as a puzzle or challenge.\n\nEverybody does things for a reason. Instead of judging, try to learn and understand their reasons. For your aunt, tell her that you're sorry (because you are, you didn't want to make her cry), tell her how smart you think she is, and just ask. She might not want to tell you, and she doesn't have to. But then pay attention and try to learn about her perspective.\n\nAlso, nobody is a failure at 21. Lots of people go through periods of years where they don't do much, and go on to hang successful and productive lives.", "She's not living up to the standard's you set for her in your head? Are you a person of such importance that your opinion matters? You're on track to get your bachelor's, you don't know you'll have it.

For starters she has to live with you, which seems pretty demoralizing.", "YTA, you go to her house and call her a failure. that's hilarious and huge!", "YTA (kind of). While telling your aunt your feelings is important you\u2019d shouldn\u2019t have done it in such a degrading way.

She goes to anime conventions or sits home watching TV, these are very harmless ways to have fun, did she have the chance to do those things as a teenager?

Look at it this way: I also work hard, I also pay my taxes and I have a different perspective on how OP should value and treat their family member. I am not actively defending OP's aunt- if you reread what I wrote, I never made an excuse for her nor said she should be able to continue \"mooching\". I said it is not OP's problem and that I don't make other people's relative economic productivity my problem. \n\nHaving worked in public service, I've been on the receiving end of people who are big mad about their tax dollars at work. In general, they were seething, angry people who needed to find a different hobby. I would be told that they paid my salary, so I should do what they say and work how they envisioned it. But no, I'm not going to rearrange how the government handles asset management because you maybe pay approximately a dollar thirty towards my annual salary. I'm getting that kind of energy from you right now.", "Not at all, I don't mind government jobs. I do however mind people just consuming tax services and providing nothing back. Society only works when people help out, being a lazy bum and not giving anything back is not sustainable."]}
