That's what the line is for.

But an industrial style speaker can get really loud. If other people are annoyed too I don\u2019t think it would be a problem making a complaint.

I am am dealing with a similar situation in my apartment building, this asshole will play incredibly loud music at all hours day and night.

It has been much quieter ever since.", "ywnbta. no matter if it is student housing or not, someone blasting music in a public housing to the point you can hear it over headphones is extremely rude and discourteous. since it\u2019s student housing, does the complex have finals week noise rules? when i was in college, all student housing during finals week had a strict noise policy. if it does, i would report them to the office.", "NTA. Your study is suffering because they want to party of waste their own time and money. Do it.", "NTA. But I would first contact management. Send an email and back up by sending a hard copy letter. Say you and other residents are bothered by the noise and if management doesn't  take action you will call the police. Then, when you do call the police, you will have evidence that you tried to get management to deal with hit first.", "INFO: Have any of you ever actually tried to talk to the guy?", "i\u2019d try asking them calmly to lower their volume before doing anything else. if they don\u2019t stop, file the complaint. you\u2019re supposed to be able to have a quiet enjoyment in your living space whether it\u2019s 2 am or 2 pm.\n\nYWNTBA", "If you are genuinely bothered by it, go for it.", "NTA call them.", "NTA, but look into the niose ordinances in your state/city.

Best to know what the local policy is before you complain. \n\nYou may even find that there's a hotline, and they can come and shut it down, without revealing your identity to the noise-maker - if/when they do come, it's fairly obvious where the noise source is, so it's not like you'd have to personally point the noisy one out of a line-up.", "My neighbor went down last weekend.  Apparently they were drunk and didn\u2019t seem to care. Levels didn\u2019t change", "Our downstairs neighbors in college had parties every night. We were super annoyed because they'd moved in after us and we didn't want to break the lease. One night we got home from work at 2am, had to be up for work at 8am, and they were still blasting music. My boyfriend asked if they could please turn it down, they said yeah, then turned it up even louder. We called the non-emergency line, the police showed and broke up the party, then the neighbors came upstairs and tried breaking down our apartment door until we had to call the police again.

Insanely enough the complex hosted a sponsored pool party the other day and even with 50 or so people outside and a bunch of speakers it was significantly quieter than the level this person is playing their music at", "In all the places I've lived, college housing areas or not, noise ordinances don't kick in til 10 PM weekdays & 12 AM weekends. It may be the same where you are. Daytime noise has no regulation.", "We're definitely at a point where it may seem silly to not ask first, but you don't know the person isn't going to do something crazy in retaliation. I absolutely wouldn't ask first with something like that because they KNOW what they're doing. They just don't think anyone will stop them from doing it. This isn't \"oh my neighbor upstairs is a little loud with footsteps or the TV\". Blasting music like that in an apartment is knowingly being a nuisance. I literally have two neighbors who try to out-nuisance each other with music. It gets ridiculous sometimes.", "Oooo, my opinion changed by that. YWNBTA", "Daytime has noise bylaws as well. They still arent supposed to go above a certain decibel.  Its obviously different from the nightime levels.", "In my neighborhood no one has ever had cops called during the day.

People don't normally complain about daytime noise BUT most neighbours are reasonable.
