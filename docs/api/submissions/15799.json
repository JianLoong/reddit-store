We've had an on again off again romantic relationship over the years as well. We know each other very well. She looks up to me in many ways. She's an aspiring novelist and writer and she often asks me for feedback and she has made it clear to me that she really likes how straightforward and clear my feedback is. \n\nShe was finishing up a first draft of a short novel that she was writing as a tribute for her uncle who had recently passed away from esophageal cancer. When she mentioned she was writing something about him, I was skeptical because he wasn't a particularly unique individual that I thought would make for an interesting subject of a novel. She had asked me to give it a read and she wanted \"brutal honesty\" from me so she could really make good adjustments for another pass at the novel.\n\nWhen I read it, I honestly thought it was irreparably horrible. The writing is subpar and lacks the polish and attention to detail that one would expect from a published work. The characters are poorly developed and lack any real depth or nuance, making it difficult for readers to connect with them or become invested in their stories. The plot is unoriginal and lacks any real sense of tension or excitement, making the book a chore to get through. I couldn't believe how horrible it was. \n\nCombine all of that with her desire for \u201cbrutally honest\u201d feedback I felt like I was given the permission to give her no holds barred notes. So I l might've gotten carried away and in the process I mentioned her uncle and told her that the character based on him is just some basic man and that she gave us no reason to become invested in it. It's a heavy handed story about cancer. I said nobody is going to care about it, if we don\u2019t care about the character and that it was a terrible way to pay respects to her uncle.\n\nMy friend was furious with me and started to tear up. She said that nothing that I gave her was constructive, even though she specifically asked for brutal honesty and I truly felt like she needed to just re-do it completely. There's nothing possibly constructive I could've said that wasn't just, \"It's terrible you have to redo it\". She said that I\u2019m disrespecting her uncle and spitting on his memory. Which I disagree with totally. She gave me full reign to be as brutal as possible so now she's mad at me for doing the exact thing that she asked for....\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682571446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130aciy/aita_for_being_too_harsh_with_my_friends_novel/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The smaller line-level changes like polishing up the prose, removing filler words, checking for inconsistencies, etc. are reserved for probably the third or fourth editing pass, minimum. Do you have any experience as a writer or editor? Because no offense but in my experience, people who don't write or edit themselves rarely give useful, actionable feedback for this reason. People seem to expect the book to come out fully formed and think they're looking for typos and such, when really it's more like building a house. You don't start with the plastering or painting or what have you. You need to make sure the foundations are solid first. Your feedback on the characterization was more relevant, though it sounds like it wasn't delivered very sensitively or in a way that gave her suggestions for improvement. In what way was the chacter flat? If he is based on her uncle, how could she have included or built upon traits of his that made him memorable to get the reader to care more? \n\nI do think that she made a mistake in asking for brutal feedback on a work she was so emotionally close to. It seems like this may have been more of a therapeutic project for her than something which is actually publishable, and that was probably hard for her to hear so honestly you were in a bad position from the start. She probably would have got upset no matter how you phrased it. However, it doesn't sound like your feedback was actually useful in any way. Saying \"throw it out and start over\" isn't helpful. No matter how bad a book is, there would have been something salvageable, even if it was just the emotions behind it that she could have used to inform a stronger version of it in the redraft.", "YTA. Anyone I have ever known that said \"I'm brutally honest\" enjoyed the brutality more than the honesty. You can be honest about the quality without being mean.\n\n\nEvery writing class that I took in college had very straightforward and blunt professors who were successful in the field, and they were never cruel. They always framed feedback as \"You tried to do x, it was unsuccessful because y, so try z instead,\" and gave a lot of specific examples. It helped me revise immensely.\n\n\n It sounds like you are following the form of criticism, but not the specificity. Saying \"Your uncle was a boring man,\" isn't helpful feedback.

How can you get that feeling to the page?\" might actually help her figure out how to revise it and is not cruel.", "Absolutely YTA.\n\nI'm a teacher of writing, so I've dealt with my fair share of terrible manuscripts.

Look for ways to improve on the story or find the aspects that are lacking. Don't just say \"this isn't good enough\".\n\nAlso, be fair to point out things that are well done. There are going to be some aspects of it which are redeemable in some capacity, try to find some to balance it out. \n\nI don't know what your background is, whether or not you're a writer or if you're in a position to critique her work, but I got the impression that you are barely qualified to judge her work to begin with.

You have no tact, and are a lousy friend and critic.", "YTA Your criticism was not constructive because you gave her nothing to work with. Basically you were telling that the novel is hopeless and should be scrapped. That may well be true, but is not useful feedback.\n\nI\u2019m a professional writer and aspiring writers often ask my opinion of their work. No matter how bad it is, I find something to praise and offer ideas about a few specific things they could do to fix the worst flaws. \n\nFor example, I told one person that changing the narrative voice in the middle of a chapter from that of a character named Brad to that of Jane seemed confusing to the reader so I\u2019d recommend a consistent narrative voice, or else having alternating chapters with the name of the narrator at the start, so some chapters have Jane\u2019s point of view and some have Brad\u2019s.\n\nIf the grammar is bad, I suggest they have someone copyedit it. If the first chapter is boring, I offer ideas on what might be a better way to hook the reader, etc. I only offer three or four major suggestions for revisions, no matter what, and also point out a few minor changes that would help, such as revising a couple of the most poorly written paragraphs. \n\nThat way, people get feedback that gives them something to work with rather than just crushing their dream. Not everyone has what it takes to be a professional writer, but everyone can work on improving their skills. I might also suggest taking a class in novel writing from a successful novelist to get more ideas or working with developmental editor to polish the story, \n\nEdited to fix a word", "YTA  Being \"brutally honest\" noticing the quality of the writing evidenced in your post it doesn't seem as if you really have the \"toolkit\" to be accurately critiquing anyone's writing and don't seem to have any grasp on what a \"first draft\" is.

Her uncle was boring? OP said (here at least) that the story should be scrapped entirely. It's hard to see how any of these things could be viewed constructively. In any case, constructive criticism and brutal honesty are hardly synonymous, so which of the two was she *really* looking for?
