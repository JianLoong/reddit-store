Regardless that guy cheated on his fiance and deserves what he's got coming. Its not up to you to raise his kid. He should be thankful that you're willing to take that responsibility and pay whatever is needed. What happens 10 years down the line when he grows a conscience and wants partial custody?

It is completely reasonable to expect him to support his baby, and she should have asked for child support sooner. It's great that you love her and the baby and are doing your share in looking after baby. But it is perfectly reasonable of you to ask your partner to seek child support when the child is not biologically yours.\n\nMy guess is that she didn't because she KNEW deep down inside that he was a flake just using her for sex.

She\u2019s not making great choices nor involving bio-dad in my opinion and don\u2019t agree we should worry about him being upset, he needs to also take responsibility, but she\u2019s not like trying to pull one over on him. Seems like everyone was in kind of a hair situation and it could have been dealt with better all around. Also I do have a weird feeling about OP having her agree to this financial situation after she\u2019s just given birth, is probably additionally emotionally distraught finding out he\u2019s not the father, and like seemingly had no other options - like what\u2019s she gonna do say no?", "That's the thing though, he's NTA in his actions towards the gf, but he is TA in his actions towards the child.\n\nHe is acting like he wants to be a dad to this kid right? How is he going to properly parent if he sticks to this agreement for the kid's whole childhood? How can you emotionally see a kid as your child but still act like they are not your problem financially? That is not going to be sustainable in the long run. It's not a situation that communicates love to the child. \n\nHe should have been trying to get his gf to get child support from the start, not when the money ran out. It's reasonable to want that, and it could have been seen as an addition to the family money. The money they both use to take care of their family. It would have made sense to break up if the gf refused to get it done.\n\nNow, after 6 months of bonding with the baby, he seems to still be in to his dad role with only one of his legs so to speak (is this also an expression in English or am I just literally translating an expression from my first language? Lmfao I don't know). Now that it turns out gf might not be able to get child support he has to choose, either he wants to be this kid's parent or not.\n\nIf he doesn't want to that's fair, but then leave now before the kid thinks of him as their father. It's not fair to this kid and gf to always have the threat of leaving hanging over their heads if they become too much of a financial burden for his liking.\n\nIf he does want to then he has to commit to it.", "He is willing to pay for the kid. But the bio dad needs to also help out here. He is not the asshole.", "Yeah I seriously wonder what happens as expenses increase and child support doesn't cover it.

Op is willing to stay with his GF who had an affair child with an engaged \u201cfriend\u201d but wants to make sure he\u2019s protected incase something happens. \n\nWhat if she has another affair with that \u201cfriend\u201d again, or if she leaves him for that (or another) \u201cfriend\u201d, or if he can\u2019t get past her  participating in infidelity or leading him to believe he was the father all along when she knew he wasn\u2019t, or if she continues prioritizing her \u201cfriends\u201d feelings over his and he cant continue feeling used. \n\nHe\u2019s giving her an option where he\u2019s there for them both emotionally and financially but only if bio dad takes financial responsibility incase something happens.

So which is it?\n\nEdit: after reading more of OPs comments I understand what he's saying better. The first few comments he made were confusing saying if he had to pay for anything it would end the relationship. It seems clearer now that he's comfortable paying for things as long as bio father is *also* paying and accepting responsibility.(edit edit: it also seems so cold to make this baby's care so transactional.

But I don't think I should be held financially responsible when the father has resources and tried to evade responsibility.  \n  \n  \nThis is why.  Because he's treating a tiny little human being as if its something he can just pick and choose what parts he wants to be involved in and what parts he doesn't want to be involved in.  He loves the baby, he has no problem raising the baby (something a parent does) but he doesn't want the financial responsibility.  What is this halfass shit?  \nLook, either you're a parent to the child, you're stepping up and taking on that role, or you're fucking not.  This is a life, a little human being that will grow up to have feelings and not understand why 'daddy' won't pay for their clothes or why 'daddy' won't pay for them to be in sports in school or why 'daddy' won't do anything that requires money... not a toy that you can pick up and play with and just put down when you decide you're done.  \nIn the same way that parents who pay child support and take on the financial responsibility of a child, but refuse to have anything else to do with the child (ever come see them, do things with them, help with raising them) suck, parents who want to be in the child's life but not be financially responsible suck just as much.  \nI get that OP isn't the bio parent and technically, legally, the child is not his responsibility.  That makes this whole situation worse because he's not just shirking responsibility that should be his but he never wanted, he's making a choice to stay with this woman and making a choice to 'raise' this child and act like a parent in some ways but when it comes to the money not be a parent.  \nThat's not how any of this works.  \nMen - I don't know why any of y'all need to hear this, but... if you're with a woman who has a child from a previous relationship or another man and you're staying in that relationship... you have a choice to make.  Either you're a parent to that child (if mom is ok with it, and if the child is ok with it presuming they're old enough to have feelings on the matter), and you're accepting all aspects and responsibilities of parenthood, or you're fucking not.  That's not to say you can't have anything to do with the child... but you're mom's boyfriend, not dad.  You can talk to them or take them out with mom for dinner or whatever, be friendly like an uncle or something, but don't try to play daddy unless you're going to go all the way.  \n  \nDo, or do not.  There is no try.  \n  \nEdit: I should clarify OP is NTA for asking his GF to go after the baby daddy for child support - there's nothing inherently wrong with saying hey he should be helping pay for this child he helped create (unless both sides are ok with him signing away his parental rights and him never having a part in the child's life in any way, and OP adopting the child).  OP is TA for refusing to help in any way financially, while simultaneously trying to raise the child and be a daddy, just not a daddy when it costs money.  What happens when the child is 8 and mom's struggling financially and baby daddy isn't working or paying child support and mom can't afford food?  Is 'daddy' going to eat dinner while letting mom and the kid starve?  Is 'daddy' going to feed mom and eat dinner and tell the kid 'sorry little dude but its your bio father's job to help buy food for you, not mine'?", "If you knew there was a chance the child wasn\u2019t yours you should have discussed financial obligations before pregnancy.

Where was she hiding anything from him?", "You might want to look into what being not exclusive means... \n\nThey were fucking other people at first as well as each other. They thought the baby might be op's and it turned out not to be. At no point did op act surprised or angry that she slept with someone else.", "You are wrong, check the comments. They both knew it might not be his and we\u2019re planning to take a paternity test after birth", "He has said multiple times in comments that his state would have held him responsible for the kid if he had started paying for stuff before the bio dad was held responsible", "Dude\u2026just run and don\u2019t look back", "Consider that if you're constantly calculating legal angles and financial risk, that you don't belong in their lives as husband/parent.", "You need to talk to a family law attorney in your state and get some clarification on how you become legally responsible for the child over the bio dad, and what also happens if you invest all this time and effort into the child and she bolts with the baby. You need to understand your rights and responsibilities (if any).", "NTA! Op, do you really see a long term relationship with a woman who knowingly slept with her engaged friend?", ">She got pregnant and we were kind of excited to start a family.  When the baby was born it was very obviously not mine. \n\nIt sounds like they BOTH were holding out hope and BOTH kind of excited, according to OP! They thought it was his until the baby came out and wasn't.", "I\u2019m not seeing that he doesn\u2019t want to spend out on the kid. Sounds like he\u2019s making a wise decision to care for the family so long as the bio father is also part of the financial responsibility so that in the event it doesn\u2019t work out. He can still walk and not be responsible while baby daddy skates", "Right -- gf didn't want to risk the friendship with bio dad, but was willing to risk the relationship with her boyfriend AND CO-PARENT.\n\nNot a wise move on her part.", "Agreed. If OP's girlfriend is gonna let more than one guy bust a nut in her, she has to take responsibility. Is she going to keep screwing other guys and expect him to pay up when she gets knocked up again? What if they break up? He is being remarkably supportive IMO. And I don't feel bad for the baby daddy at all, cheating on his fiance. He's sorry he got caught.", "It also shows how much she values her current relationship with OP and the welfare of her child when she\u2019s blaming OP for ruining daddy fuck buddy\u2019s life by not supporting her child.", "If by \"anything happened to him\" you mean if he were to pass on, in the dying mode, so to speak, then the child would collect social security from the gov't until the age of 18.", "AND he took care of her through the whole pregnancy and is still taking care of her and the child. Even if he isn't paying for all of the child's needs. The bio should do that, especially if he isn't present. I'm sure op buys things for baby, just isn't footing the bill for it ...."]}
