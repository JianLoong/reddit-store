What's not fine is doing it where she knows she can leak on other's furniture. And let's not kid ourselves; menstruation is normal and shouldn't be demonized, but blood, no matter the source, is a biohazard. That is where I would draw the line.

I'll have to research this because I'm honestly at a loss.\n\nEdit: what I found out\nGenerally, free bleeding is deemed safe for the person doing it, though there are some things to consider when it comes to those around you.

Pads are uncomfortable and tampons can be a \"no way\" ordeal. So if I were to play devil's advocate, I would say perhaps this girl has these issues and it's a sensitive subject for her. Having to own up to it is surely exceedingly embarrassing and her boyfriend is upset that she's upset. \n\nHowever, she's not 15 and still getting used to her cycle. She's and adult and clearly stated she did this practice purposely.  This means every month she makes a conscious choice to go out in public and chance that her bodily fluids will be left behind wherever she sits. This cannot be the first time this has happened.

They even make 100% cotton reusable pads if she's worried about chemicals or dyes or whatever.", "She was wearing black pants so nobody noticed stains or anything on her clothes", "But..but..but..people need to be open-minded, and respect their practices and beliefs! Who cares if it's unhygienic, and ruins other people's property? They're allowed to get dirty blood everywhere...especially in someone else's home! No need to respect the homeowner and their property...\n\nUgh...so revolting.\n\nOP is definitely NTA", "Thank you. This appeal to nature nonsense is absurd, just because something is natural does not mean it is better.", "this made me laugh so hard jajajajjaj", "They are at very least vandals, damaging other people\u2019s property.  Doesn\u2019t matter whether it was blood, wine, spaghetti sauce, or red paint.  The couch is still stained.\n\nIf they can\u2019t be trusted not to go around damaging everything in their vicinity, they need to limit visits to the great outdoors.", "Why?", "I just want to add to this that I\u2019ve never been able to wear pads without being acutely aware that a giant piece of cotton was stuck in my underwear. It\u2019s always made me deeply uncomfortable. However, after having a baby you are only allowed to wear pads during the postpartum bleeding. Buying heavy duty period panties were an absolute game changer. The underwear feel just slightly thicker than a normal pair and really contain the mess. So if anyone reading this has sensory issues with pads just know that the period undies can be a good alternative that manage to keep you comfortable while also making sure you don\u2019t get bloodstains on everything you touch.", "Dude fuck off, I\u2019m trying my ass off not to wheeze too loud next to my boss lol. Free shitting how marvelous!", "Do you just free bleed all over your carpet and furniture, though? Like I put a pad down and wear black loose shorts or pants, I don\u2019t drip all the fuck over the place. And it doesn\u2019t leave my home.", "So you just... bleed through your clothes onto whatever furniture you're sitting on??", "All of this! And OP, to make ME feel better, please, while you're shouting this jump up and down and point your finger in the air!!! UGH.", "I promise this actually happened lol", "Perhaps you could try the free peeing round their house?", "Laughed so hard I just peed a little. But not on their furniture.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Hahaha thanks for making me cackle \ud83e\udd23", "Shit, I just made the same suggestion \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah op is NTA. This is just disrespectful to their home and belongings. Not to mention unhygienic.", "I'm sorry, what? Having a period is pretty normal for a lot of pre-menopausal people. You're not supposed to hold it in", "This!\nFree bleeding sounds awesome and I really wanted to try it for some time but it just isn\u2019t for me (yet?). \nIt is not, however, an excuse to bleed all over someone\u2019s house. Accidents happen, even for non-free bleeders, but then you own up and apologise and don\u2019t run around dripping some more. \n\nFrom what I gathered when I read into it a few years ago, most people wear some form of back up so that they don\u2019t stain. I don\u2019t necessarily think blood is gross but I wouldn\u2019t want it all over my place either. I prefer it inside of my body and when it does have to part it can do so in a non-disturbing way, thank you very much. \n\nGeez. NTA. It speaks of your ability to consider the other person\u2019s perspective that you had to ask, though!", "Whelp. Enough internet for today.", "I thought that\u2019s what free bleeding meant\u2026not literally marking your damn territory like an unfixed dog", "This is right on!!! She knows exactly what she is doing and you need to warn others about her .", "Free bleeding is specifically a protest to combat the stigma and injustices around menstruation so the point is to not use the special panties. I don\u2019t agree with it but just want to clear up the misconception.", "Lol can't believe some incel losers downvoted your comment. People need to stop shaming us for practicing free pooping in the comfort of other peoples' homes.", "I've met some people who practiced it to raise awareness of menstrual distress (not having access to products, etc). Otherwise, you'd think one would use at least a cover or a towel on someone else's furniture. NTA.", "Oooh mind sharing the brand? I\u2019d really like to switch but I\u2019m always afraid of period panties not holding enough\u2026", "I just cannot imagine going over to someone's house and knowingly bleed on their things, it is bad enough when you know you have leaked", "Also good!", "If she is, they're not working.", "I have a brand of period underwear that's very popular over here but they hold up to 12 tampons worth of blood. She really must not because even on days I feel like I'm dying, they work perfectly.", "Free bleeding is not about period underwear (which is an absolute godsend IMO). It's about doing nothing out of the ordinary when you're on your period. Wearing your same clothes wearing your same underwear, etc. \n\nDon't understand the benefits myself, but benefits are not you just don't go around leaving your blood all over somebody else's house. Doesn't matter if it's menstrual blood, blood from a bloody nose, whatever\n\nOP is NTA", "Metal recycling actually, where heroin, diabetic etc. needles are far too common!", "Many then use period underwear (especially at night) because it is also about reducing waste. If the period is not very heavy and you can go to the toilet regularly, then it works without protection.\nBut if someone practices free-bleeding and drips around, they are doing something wrong.", "Totally! So I\u2019m super lucky (now. I used to have really heavy periods), and my flow is light to moderate. I wear normal underwear for light days and specific period underwear on heavy days. I don\u2019t use any other period products.\n\nFree bleeding is more complex than a lot of us think because it can (and has) been used as a movement (which I totally support!). But personally I like it because I\u2019m not using any extra products, I don\u2019t have to worry about putting gross chemicals in my body (or super scratchy organic tampons), etc. \n\nTechnically use of pads or pantyliners do not qualify as part of free bleeding. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s your period and who cares. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s the choice of the person having the period\u2026but it\u2019s not okay to go to a dinner and bleed all over someone\u2019s house. Using specific period panties probably could have helped here.", "I\u2019m also curious, do you wear period panties?", "You don\u2019t use anything at all , just normal underwear.", "No that's disgusting. Pads were invented for a reason lol free bleeding means not stuffing anything up there to restrict the natural flow, some women just take it to the extreme and use no sanitary products whatsoever. Some even free bleed onto the earth at nighttime. Sounds like the gf was on that end of the term.", "Usually people who free bleed wear period panties, which do a pretty good job of absorbing a normal menstrual flow. I wear them overnight for when my menstrual cup just can't keep up.", "No.", "Then I am sincerely sorry about that, and a bit sorry for the free-bleeder whose periods are so heavy she's dripping onto the floor", "I\u2019m wondering how the hell you can hold it in to begin with!", "For real. Period products suck, I obviously get it. But there are too many options nowadays to excuse this.", "Super absorbent kind on knix. I got mine from knixteen though (just the teen section of the site).", "Yeah, that is not ok, at all. At the VERY MOST (and I would never do this), I would like take a puppy pad with me. But that would be with permission. It\u2019s just gross as shit, and I\u2019m not grossed out by period blood.", "I tried the period underwear recently, I didn\u2019t care for it but it worked well.", "aaaah, then i think it's a cool thing! tampons and pads are terrible for the environment. my flow was always definitely too heavy to get away with just frequent toilet trips but i hear period underwear is really effective. OPs friend should really invest in that lol", "honestly i usually \"free bled\" on light flow days then, i would frequently forego panty liners on low flow days knowing i'd need to wash some blood off of my underwear. they're expensive and so wasteful :(\n\nbut yeah i can't imagine most people who free bleed could possibly believe it's ok to bleed on someone's couch. i mean, aside from being unhygienic bodily fluid, if you stain someone's furniture with anything (food, juice, whatever) then you should be expected to clean it? OPs friend has a really weird take on this", "Ok, got it lol. I thought you were saying something else. When I say \u201cpads\u201d I mean like sleep pads though I rarely bleed through the shorts or sweats, personally.", "Ok, that sounds like a normal and fine way to handle a period, not like \"free bleeding\" at all. This girl was obviously not doing that.", "Then what does free bleeding mean? From this post it sounds like just ignoring that you are bleeding at all and doing whatever you would normally do", "I would amazed that someone has a period that isn't that heavy. Good luck getting older where your periods start to look like a murder scene!", "I assumed she just sat on the floor at some point", "Lots and lots of Kegals? And here I thought free bleeding just meant... well... bleeding freely on things", "I'm really lucky because my periods have always been pretty light. I only use tampons the first two nights - the rest of the time I notice when there's a rush of blood and go to the toilet. Similar to when you have to pee. And I have never \u201edripped\u201c anywhere \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude05", "100%. I can\u2019t imagine thinking this is an okay situation.", "Yeah, sometimes people do it as a form of protest (I believe one woman ran the London marathon while free bleeding to call attention to the environmental impact of menstrual products) where they just let it all go, but usually it just means not using anything \"unnatural\" to collect the flow -- so no cups, tampons, pads, etc.", "Sometimes people do it as a form of protest or to raise awareness, but usually it means just not using cups, tampons or pads in favor of period panties.", "I mean I *have* heavy periods and I don't think I'd be dripping on the floor unless I was going commando in a skirt *and* taking wide, confident strides, but everyone is different", "Until you sneeze \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I have heavy periods and I've dripped on the floor with pads, and trousers on. Recently I bled on a waiting room seat when I took my kids to the dentist and had the audacity to sit when the dentist was checking their teeth. I was so embarrassed and I had a nighttime pad on at the time.\nI'd never dare to free bleed, I do not think it would go well for me.", "OMG what if she was in a skirt, commando, free-bleeding? Does she believe in panties? I'm cringing so hard right", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\ude78\ud83e\ude78\ud83e\ude78", "I have the same problem.  It can be so embarrassing just to leave the house sometimes.  Glad I'm not the only one wearing nighttime pads throughout the day to survive.", "I usually wouldn't go far from home but they're irregular too and seem to be able to pick the most inconvenient day or time to start.\nBut I'm glad I'm not the only one too, if something goes wrong people just suggest upping the protection you're wearing and I'm already wearing everything I can.\nTampons, a nighttime pad and period pants. Also a spare pair of tight pants then my regular clothes.\nThe effort I put into not bleeding on things to avoid this exact scenario. I would be eternally ashamed."]}
