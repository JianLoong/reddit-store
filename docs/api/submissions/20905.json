For example: She used to run a business and asked the family to help out as she got on her feet. 10 years later, she depended on all of us and refused to hire any other workers.

However, my mom is one of 8 kids and they all vie for her affection to the point where they\u2019ve infantilized her for over the last decade. Whatever grandma says, goes. Including flying her out during the height of Covid. Everyone was afraid of saying no to her. So they recently closed on her house and she was moved into a small little community here in Nevada. I\u2019ve visited her a couple times within the last week and took her grocery shopping, out to lunch etc. not because I had to but because I wanted to. \n\nNow apparently my mom thinks I\u2019m her caregiver.

I already stood my ground and told her that I made other plans far before she ever moved out here. My friend is getting married in a few months and I have bridesmaids duties. I\u2019m going on a trip in august and just other basic life plans that I\u2019m not going to put my life on hold for. My mom works part time since her business closed and I feel like she\u2019s holding this grudge against me for quitting.\n\nNow she\u2019s telling my grandma that I don\u2019t want to see her and complaining to anyone who will listen (including her siblings) about how no one is helping her and how she feels taken advantage of.

You need to make it clear that you're not going to be the caregiver.   \nDon't let your mom make you feel guilty, you're still willing to do stuff with your grandma when you can and that should be good enough.   \nYou can help when you're able but don't let anyone push you on that.  \n\n\nThe fact your mom told your grandma that you don't want to see her, makes your mom extremely childish and petty, do not feel guilty.", "NTA\n\nYour mother lies and blackmails you and pressures you to work for her and ... how can you believe, your mother is not the AH?", "NTA\n\nYou're not the family's caregiver for hire. You have your own life and plans.\n\nYour grandma's got 8 children, they can pitch in. In fact, I think you should go NC with your family because you're being used and exploited and guilt-tripped. For the sake of your mental health and respect, please do.", "NTA. Your mother is trying to manipulate you into doing what she ought to be doing for her mother, She does, after all, have a lot more free time than you do.\n\nBoundaries are going to be very important here. Tell your mother you are not available for any of what she thinks you should be doing for her mother and enforce it...but when you feel like it, visit your grandmother to preserve that relationship (if you choose to).", "NTA, you did the right thing, you only feel guilty because that\u2019s what your mother is trying to do.

Just help out when it suits you and ignore your mom's guilt trips.  Enjoy your trip in August!", "NTA\n\nThere are these peopl \"Give them a finger, and they\u2019ll take the whole hand\" was inveted for. You mum seems to fall into that category pretty much.\n\nThe problem with those people is, you would even like to help, and normally you would be able to, however due to their disposition you often can' t help at all, because you would end up stuck with morethan you bargained for.\n\nTry to be very clear like \"mum, I will do this and that, but I will not be doing that one and that. Deal or no deal at all?\"\n\nAlso try to use text messages a lot so she can' t get back on your agreement claiming you agreeed to do more.\n\nIF that still doesn't work, just visit completely separately from your mother and low contact her until she ceases the harassement.", "NTA. You don't have to give your mom any reasons. \"No I'm busy,\" is all she needs. You're just feeling guilty because you have been in a toxic, manipulative relationship with your mom way too long. Visit G'ma on your own time and do things for her when you want to, because you want to. Not because mom still thinks she is the boss.\n\nKeep your spine shiny.", "NTA. Your mom is trying to guilt and take advantage of you. It would be one thing if she asked you when you could help. But she didn't ask. She demanded and the end of the day this is her responsibility.
