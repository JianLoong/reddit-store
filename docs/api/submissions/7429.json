As such, I have been in my fair share of uncomfortable situations at work where I've needed to use the bathroom. I do find it to be quite embarrassing when it does happen, but I have a method I follow that seems to work well. First, I will find an empty bathroom if possible. Then, I flush the toilet simultaneously as I am going to mask any sounds and/or smells. I apologize if this is TMI.\n\nAnyways, I have noticed that some people at work have pretty much zero shame while using the bathroom - they will release gas, have explosive diarrhea, etc without trying to cover it up in the slightest. Whereas I am the type of person who will sit there and try to wait for the bathroom to clear out before I even think about going number two. I work in a very professional environment and I would just be absolutely mortified if a coworker knew it was me blowing up the bathroom. Although at times I do wish I just didn't care. \n\nThis brings me to early last week. I was using the restroom (just peeing) when someone came in and started to have a loud episode on the toilet. I guess you could say I was overcome with curiosity because as I was washing my hands I decided to stick around in the bathroom to wait for this person to come out of the stall. I was genuinely curious who this could be with just no embarrassment regarding their audible bathroom-using. \n\nI stood in front of the mirror, pretended to fix my hair and what not until they came out. \n\nTurns out it was a girl on a team adjacent to mine. We have been friendly in the past but I don't know her very well. As she came out of the stall, I started to make small talk with her. I ended up saying something along the lines of \"You too, huh?\" to which she seemed confused. I then elaborated on the whole IBS ordeal. To be honest with you I was just kind of looking to connect with someone that shares similar issues to me. She was nice about it but a bit reserved which I get.\n\nWell, a few days later I found myself essentially being scolded by my manager and HR. Apparently this girl felt that I was being rude and intrusive. Not only is that not the case, but some of my other coworkers have gotten wind of this situation and are now calling me out and think that I'm an asshole for \"harassing\" someone in the bathroom. I feel like this whole thing has been blown out of proportion and now I myself am feeling embarrassed and awkward, and my coworkers have been acting weird around me. \n \nAlso not sure if this matters or not, but this all took place in a gender neutral restroom. \n\nAm I really an asshole for this?

People have gas, diarrhea, etc. Some sound like a cow peeing and others never make a sound. You prefer to waste water and pretend you never fart or poop.  That\u2019s your problem.  When someone else is having a moment and you wait around to see who, that\u2019s just creepy and invasive of the shared etiquette of privacy, even though we all know that privacy isn\u2019t the same in a public bathroom.", "YTA.  This is so fucking weird on so many levels.  First of all, it's weird to judge other people for just using the bathroom normally and not trying to disguise every little sound from what they're doing.  It's a bathroom.  The whole point is to take care of bodily functions.  If they're there, that's probably what they're doing, why try to hide it?  No big deal.  Everybody poops.  This obsession with hiding it is what's strange, that's some immature bullshit the rest of us stopped doing after high school.  \n\nBut the main point here, WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU WAIT TO SEE WHO IT IS???  That is SO INCREDIBLY FUCKED UP.  If you hear someone else's bodily functions happening, the proper and polite thing to do is finish up whatever business you have in the bathroom as swiftly as possible, and exit.  Bathrooms are not the place to hang around and make small talk.  You do your business and leave.  Fuck, even those of us with weird kinks and fetishes around body functions mostly understand that and wouldn't do something this wildly inappropriate.  \n\nThird, the fact that you did this in a gender neutral bathroom just pushes all of the above over the top.  It would already be incredibly weird if you were a girl doing this in a single gender bathroom, but you're a MAN??  You waited there for 15 MINUTES?? What man ever actually legitimately spends 15 minutes or more \"freshening up\" in the middle of a public bathroom - absolutely none that I know, even the very femme guys that wear makeup and stuff.  Even if you DID have that amount of \"freshening up\" to possibly do, most ordinary people would hear someone else \"blowing up the toilet\" and choose to take the route of leaving the bathroom and finishing their grooming later or elsewhere.  I guarantee you, she did not for one second think that you were just \"freshening up\" and still had any legitimate reason to be in that bathroom for as long as you were.\n\nFrom this girl's perspective, some dude she hardly knows just hung around in the bathroom for a quarter of an hour listening to her take a nasty shit, and then started making small talk about it when she finally had to face him to get back to work because he wouldn't leave the bathroom.  Do you not understand how that looks like you're getting some kind of sexual excitement out of this and are trying to hit on her or something?  I guarantee you have just topped her list of creepiest people she's ever met in her life.\n\nI don't believe you for one second that this isn't some kind of voyeurism behaviour, it is NOT NORMAL to be \"just curious\" about another person's bowel movements.  Even if you truly don't have any sexual motivations, this was still incredibly inappropriate, I just can't fathom what kind of grown ass adult decides they want to know about their coworker's poop habits.  This is beyond rude and intrusive.  You're definitely a huge asshole, OP, and honestly, you are incredibly lucky that you still have a job and are just being scolded.  What you did here is getting seriously close to committing an actual sex crime in many places, and I'm honestly surprised you didn't get straight up fired.

That\u2019s beyond creepy!!", "I could probably give the benefit of the doubt that he was trying to be a creep toward her and that didn't know it was a woman in the stall \nBut as soon as he saw it was a she, the fact that didn't click on him was that \"hey, I'm super shy and conscious about my medical issue, probably another coworker could be the same\" especially if it's a person of the opposite sex.\nFrom time to time the cleaning crew enters the bathroom while some of us are still in it (we have separate bathrooms but all the cleaning personnel are men)\nWe have a really small, good day, evening, etc.\nBut they have never, ever asked me about my bowel movements.\nIt's baffling that somebody that says he feels extremely uncomfortable about his medical issue can't seem to understand how creepy this was.\nJust baffling", "Now I\u2019m picturing a bathroom SWAT team: \n\n\u201cAll right buddy! Come out of the stall right now with your butt wiped & your pants up! NOW! Don\u2019t make us use these spray cans on your ass!\u201d", "Great point - who\u2019s going to wait the longest. The pooper or the listener? Poor thing - you can\u2019t even have IBS in a stall without people passing judgement. I think if the movie white chicks scene - and yep not to be commented on.\n\nI have a phobia as I have IBS so I just go to the upstairs BR where I can poop in obscurity.", "TBH, if OP was my coworker, I would heavily avoid her for the rest of the time we were coworkers. Not out of embarrassment, but because there's something \"off\" about being so fascinated by someone pooping.\n\n\n\nIf I was the coworker, I would wonder if she likes other people pooping **too** much, you know? I would be debating on if she was a creep that I should worry about. If OP keeps this up, her coworkers will know her as \"the weird lady who really likes people pooping\" in no time. Someone will get skeeved out and other people WILL know, ESPECIALLY if it's a gossipy work environment like she describes it.", "OP: stand creepily in the bathroom \"fixing\" his hair\n\nMe: welp looks like I live here now.", "Right?! I would STILL be traumatized in that bathroom stall!!!", "UC patients unite!", "OP did not even grant the basic level of empathy that he would want for himself. It's baffling.", "Hahahaha, it sounds like this office needs a bathroom SWAT team to deal with OP and probably a team of those roving therapists they send out after tragedies for his coworkers. Maybe some of those comfort retrievers.", "*him, apparently. \nMakes it even creepier somehow", "Yep. I am just boggled that he thinks this is acceptable and defensible behavior.

I pooped, I wiped, I flushed. And he just wouldn't leave. He just kept fluffing his hair. It was only fifteen minutes but it felt like an eternity. I didn't think I would ever get out of that stall.\"", "Absolutely.", "The reason OP is so shocked about other people's \"shameless\" bathroom behavior is because ~~she~~ OMG *HE* doesn't understand the etiquette of giving people privacy and ignoring it.", "Yup she changed her story in the post. While she waited she said: \n\n\n>I was genuinely curious who this could be with just *no embarrassment* regarding their audible bathroom-using.\n\n\nMind you, after an entire paragraph talking about how people at work have \"no shame\" and how she'd be \"mortified\" to do the same. \n\n\n\nIt was only after telling us the girl freaked out that OP says:\n\n\n>I was just kind of looking to connect with someone that shares similar issues to me.", "I feel like that would be me.

If it had been strictly curiosity (albeit a very invasive one that I do not condone) then they might have waited out in the hall either out of site or just nonchalantly to see who comes out (that\u2019s weird too).

Pls consider caring less about other people's shit", "YTA and it's none of your business.

In the same way you like to flush the toilet to cover the sound (and honestly help it go down and reduce the smell) you/i/we and all the normal people too I imagine, do not want to draw attention or talk about what just went on in the stall.\n\nSo yes, bad move. And I\u2019m sorry, but it and would come off creepy of you to hang back because you were curious and wanted a bathroom likened friend.", "YTA. You did to her what you work so hard to avoid having others do to you.", "... I'm very hopeful you're just a troll with too much time on your hands. \n\nThere's no way someone would actually have such a lack of awareness. \n\nYou literally just went on and on about how embarrassing going to the bathroom is and then you waited another person out for 15 minutes to chat about their bathroom experience?\n\nAre you mentally capable of flipping the situation? What if a coworker confronted you about your issues after listening carefully to all of your flushing? Like, \"Wow, 8 flushes today, I think you might need to change your eating habits! I always wondered who flushed excessively when they were shitting! Now I know it's you!\" \n\nCan you genuinely not see how that is unacceptable behaviour?", "Besides, it\u2019s a BATHROOM?

After the big long- and valid introduction explaining how embarrassing you find crapping in public\u2026the story segues into- what was that? Waiting 15 minutes for a lower GI issue bonding moment? Was a golden ray of sunshine supposed to suddenly illuminate the bathroom through the window as an Angel choir sang blessings upon such a connection?\n\nHoly smokes I\u2019ve seen some posts in here seriously lacking in self awareness but this takes the urinal cake. YTA. \n\nEdit: I have gut issues and personally though I don\u2019t think anyone should feel shame for it, I *would* however think that OP would recognize that this was a horrifying thing to do.", "And then decided it was a good idea to 'discuss' it.", "Invasive, creepy, and very inappropriate. Who in their right mind thinks this would be ok", "It's almost enough to report her to HR", "now that I know OP is a man, I 100% think he has a scat fetish...and/or is turned on by making women uncomfortable/embarrassed.\n\nI don't think he's as clueless as he pretends.", "Well to be fair he graduated from staring at other men at urinals while nodding and saying \u201cyou too, huh\u201d.", "The OP is beyond oblivious.  He would be mortified if anyone knew he was tooting in a toilet (because otherwise they would assume he is above all human frailty?) so he ensures that his colleague is mortified instead.\n\nWhat contortions does he think would be effective in forestalling an attack of \"explosive diarrhea\" or minimizing the sounds.  The word \"explosive\" kind of of says it all.  And really, if he thinks it is inappropriate to let loose in the loo, where would be appropriate?    \nThere is a children's book \"Everybody Poops\".  Because everybody does.  All humans are messy and gross and occasionally gassy and I doubt there is anyone who has reached adulthood who hasn't blown up a toilet or two.  The only polite thing to do if someone in the next stall is in extremis is to breath shallowly, finish your business, and pretend you didn't notice.  You don't ambush them.", "I reread the post like 3 times (ew, I know) and don\u2019t see where OP mentioned he\u2019s a dude or that he waited 15 mins.

That's what we are there for!  \n\nBe clean, be courteous of the next person coming through.  Leave it like you would want to find it.   \n\nBut masking sounds and being embarrassed by the smell is silly.  It why there is a place for it.  If it sounded nice and smelled fantastic, we would just go wherever was convenient in the moment.\n\nNote bathrooms should have sprays and ventilation to help with the smell, and if you've left a bad smell and have spray available use it!!!

Hell I thought Op was a woman and scat fetish crossed my mind.", "I find it creepy regardless of gender, because if I was a dude I wouldn\u2019t want this same situation to happen to me or anyone; OP you are not making yourself look any better\u2026she was probably uncomfortable, put yourself in her shoes please.", "THANK YOU! Literally just said the same thing about the shoes.", "And you can see people's footwear from either side of a stall.

Big nope from me on gender neutral bathrooms.", " That's all I could think about while reading this.  that poor girl was probably sitting on the toilet thinking, \"For the love of God please just get the fuck out, lady!\" Such an awkward situation to create for someone else for literally no reason whatsoever.", "I've said this elsewhere but I'm going to say it again: I would have stayed in there forever and lost my fucking job because they would all think I just dipped out.
