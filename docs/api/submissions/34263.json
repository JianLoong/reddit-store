He knows what's right, and is just trying to duck his responsibility.", "NTA. Your friend is greedy. He caused damage to the property and wants you to pay for it. I would fight him on this and even go as far as reaching out to his parents on Facebook, if it comes to that. Legally, I\u2019m not sure what you can do but depending on the deposit amount, you could certainly look at small claims court. Take pictures of the damage for your records.", "It's not fair that you're going to be screwed over on this.  However, unless you have a contract stating specifically on the lease that you are only liable for communal and your personal living areas, you're boned.

There's no way you should be expected to pay for their damages.", "NTA - he's trying to take advantage. I agree - if it was common areas, that would be different, but this is HIS ensuite and he is fully responsible for it.", "Info - do you have an itemized list from the landlord for what the damages are? What does your lease say about damages?", "NTA", "NTA. Why should you pay for damages to his living area when he caused them? You would be responsible to split the damages for all the communal areas but each person would be responsible for the damage they did for their exclusive room. Explain it as 'If I sledge hammered all the walls in my room do you think you should be expected to pay for the repairs?'", "NTA but for record, anytime you move into a place, you need to document and existing damage to all rooms even the ones you won't be living in, even the smallest of things so you aren't held liable.", "NTA - if you didn't cause the damage, demand your deposit back in full.", "NTA if there is damage to his ensuite, that is on him and him alone.  Common areas could be considered a whole other matter.", "NTA, damages to the en-suite are for the person who resided in the en-suite", "NTA. You're offering to cover the hallway damage, which is totally reasonable for shared spaces. Your roommate needs to get that the deposit split was based on the rooms' differences. You're not being unjust; you're just sticking to the original deal. Keep holding your ground", "NTA. His \"point of view\" is to screw you over. You must not pay for damage you had no part in.", "NTA - that is absurd!  Keep all the documentation you can - from the landlord specifying where the damage is, from you making sure to text or email your point of view.  There is not one single reason to pay for any damage to his room.  But you make have to go to small claims court unless you can figure this out.", "NTA you play for what you damage if you really never went into the en-suite then don\u2019t play for it the hallway is shared and because the damage to the hallway can\u2019t be split by person you shoudl both pay 50:50 \n\nIn total you pay for half the hallway\nHe pays for the other half + his own private en-suite.\nNo questions about it\nHe\u2019s using you for money so you need to sort this out before it escalates"]}
