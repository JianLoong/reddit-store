I have a family of all boys, as does she, except her youngest, which is a girl. Our kids get along great and have been raised pretty much as cousins. We do a lot of things with our kids all together. The problem is when I want to spend time with just Shelly, she will bring her daughter without warning and say \"I thought we were having a girls night\". It feels underhanded and  intrusive.\r  \n   This has gone on for a number of years and always gotten under my skin. I know her husband is a bit controlling and doesn't let Shelly go many places without her daughter. He says Shelly needs to take her and \u201cteach her to be a girl\u201d (whatever that means) since she has all brothers. Plus,we shouldn't be doing or saying anything we couldn't in front of their daughter.\r  \n   I feel like if any of the kids get to come, they all should get the option. It shouldn\u2019t be just the daughter \u201cbecause she\u2019s a girl\u201d, excluding my kids because they are boys, and there are more of them.\r  \nI don't have a problem with the girl at all. She is a great kid! But she is not my \"friend\". I don't want to hang out with a pre-teen girl. I don\u2019t want her hearing what\u2019s going on in my life. I don\u2019t want her juvenile input into adult situations. And I sure don\u2019t want her repeating everything at the middle school lunch tables the next day. I feel like an asshole just saying that, but it\u2019s true.\r  \n   It all came to a head when Shelly wanted to take a trip together as a \"friendversary\" of sorts, without the kids. Absolutely! I'm all in! Date set, location, visions of toes in the sand with drinks in hand........and then she lets it slip that her daughter is coming. (Eyeroll, of course, should have known.)\r  \nI'm out.\r  \nI politely declined. I told her I didn't think I was going to go. She asked why. I said I thought we weren\u2019t bringing the kids. She said it's a girls trip. I told her, either we are taking the kids, and mine are included, or it\u2019s just adults. Shelly got super upset and began telling me how disappointed her daughter would be, and how her daughter wanted it to be \u201cjust us girls\u201d.\r  \nSometimes I just miss my friend, having a drink, and talking about inappropriate middle age women bullshit without the daughter. \r  \nIf I say that, it hurts Shelly's feelings and she thinks I don't like her daughter.\r  \n\r  \nAITA for wanting to back out of every social situation every time she includes her daughter?\n\n\r  \n\\*TLDR: My friend always brings her daughter \"because she is a girl\" when we hang out.

Tell her gender has nothing to do it and you're not going to exclude your sons from things because they have penises. Age is the only factor here- either it's an adults trip and you're in or it's not and you're out.

There's a difference between girls and women. There's a difference between adult friends and friends' relationships with each other's children. If you can weather this and you think the friendship is worth it, you can either suck it up or have a serious conversation with your friend and don't allow her to make it about anything other than what it really is: her child chaperone.  \n\nOpenly ask her if there's a serious reason for including her child; is she worried to leave her daughter alone with her husband and/or brothers? It's hard for me to believe that your friend actually does think this is OK. Maybe she has other concerns. Maybe there's a possibility that her daighter can stay with a friend instead.\n\nPersonally, I would prepare a \"spontaneous\" lesson plan for every time I was with the daughter involving freedom, reproductive rights, the constitution, forgotten women heroes, tolerance, anything that helps her to become a strong individual and fight her father's brainwashing.  Your friend wants her to be one of the girls? Then help her a strong one. Either that, or always bring your own children under the assumption that children are invited. Don't allow distinctions along gender lines.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s reasonable you want to have time with your friend, alone. I can understand maybe there is a certain level of filtering that you have to do when her kid is present, so I can totally empathize with you not wanting her along all the time.\n\nIt seems like your friend wants her daughter to have a relationship with you, so maybe if you\u2019re inclined, you can have a \u201cgirls day\u201d where the daughter is invited (maybe getting nails done or something?). This could satisfy your friend and maybe give you more wiggle room to invite your friend to hangout with just the two of you.", "NTA Your friend's husband can't be bothered to watch his daughter. By your own admission he's controlling. However, that's the dynamic of her marriage and her problem to resolve.\n\nShe needs to accept not everyone of her friend's is going to want her daughter tagging along when they get together. Adults with children need to spend time with other adults and enjoy adult conversations without their children. Your friends may get offended but it's just a basic fact of life.

It really sounds like something isn't right with this family. It's weird that the daughter isn't being encouraged to find her own friends. The husband's controlling behavior probably means your friend is feeling a lack of autonomy within this situation.  A lot of sexist subtext in the situation, too. Agree on all that.  \n\n\nIf he's a controller, then he's killing 2 birds with 1 stone: getting his daughter supervised and preventing his wife from doing things she can't do with her kid along. The daughter's presence also might inhibit your friend from discussing the larger problems with that relationship.  \n\n\nTo me, it sounds like your friend might really need a friend right now and also need to get away from her husband, whether she is feeling pressure to have her daughter along or not.  It might be possible to have her along, but plan some activities for her, like a rafting or horseback tour or something while you get some adult time.", "NTA in the slightest - there is a difference between girly dates where you do cute stuff with kids - and a women\u2019s only weekend away.

Reading all of your posts it sounds like the daughter is the golden child.  She demands attention from mom all of the time and dad backs it up.  Time to take a step back from her as a friend, not just the girl time thing but in total.  Hard for the families but she needs to have her daughter understand that you are and adult friend of the parents.  The daughter needs to understand that you are not her BFF.

That as a mother yourself, you want some time with just adults to relax and hang out. If she doesn't feel she can do that without her daughter present, that's fine and you will plan accordingly, but it will also limit the things you agree to do together.

If I\u2019ve gone through the trouble of arranging child care and someone regularly shows up with their kid I\u2019d be pissed and certainly not putting myself in a position to do that again.", "Nta, but Shelly isn't your friend anymore. That shit happens when you have kids, unfortunately. People cannot deal with it.", "NTA\n\nJust communicate this with Shelly. Tell her everything you've told us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I don't want to hang out with a pre-teen girl. I don\u2019t want her hearing what\u2019s going on in my life. I don\u2019t want her juvenile input into adult situations. And I sure don\u2019t want her repeating everything at the middle school lunch tables the next day.", "NAH, sounds like her husband is forcing her to take her daughter so she can't cheat and she can report back what's being said. If she's being abused she won't mention it in front of her kid.", "NTA\n\n\"Either all of the kids or none of the kids. If this is because your husband refuses to watch your daughter, I'm sorry. I just find it hard to believe you never want time with another adult and no kids, so I assume its him. If its not, I'm sorry I assumed. Either way I'm not ditching my kids to hang out with someone elses anymore.\"", "NTA, this is the Hisbands way of stopping the wife having fun on her own (getting drunk and rolling in at 4am) I know.this because my wife has a friend who does exactly the same things and her husband is a bellend.", "NTA. \n\nI totally get not wanting to give up your precious down time just to feel constrained by the presence of someone else's child. Obviously this changes the dynamic of what you can say and how you can act. I love hanging out with my best friend and her kid...I also love just hanging out with just my friend, smoking weed, talking shit, and going to restaurants with lots of spicy menu options. There is a time and place for both and it's not a huge ask for your friend to understand where you're coming from with this. It's not like you're saying you can't stand being around her kid, you're just saying you'd like a get together where you don't have to restrict basic adult behaviors.", "NTA\n\nI feel this so hard. When my best friend was dating her now exhusband he was always there. We made a friends day date and wanted to talk about best friends stuff and he would be there. She told me he would be gone that day.. but he was there. I finally snapped and told her I needed a break from her. (I told her many times before that I didn't feel good about him being there) so after about half a year we finally met again and she made more of an effort. \n\nSometimes we just want our friend and to talk in private. I think your friend should accept that.", "NTA.  Tell her exactly what you said here - sometimes you want to be adults and not kid friendly and not Moms and talk about inappropriate middle aged women stuff.", "NTA.  It's possible the father is foisting the daughter on you as a chaperone.  \n\nIs there any chance Shelley is bringing her because the father can't be trusted around the daughter?", "NTA\n\nShelly\u2019s behavior with her daughter is not healthy for either of them. Shelly\u2019s daughter needs to develop her own friends, interests, etc. Regardless, you have absolutely every right to not go to things her daughter attends as well.", "NAH. But, could she be bringing her daughter along because she is reluctant to leave her alone with her husband? Feel her out to make sure they are safe at home, and there is no abuse or neglect. Then explain that you miss having adult time, and really want to have a ladies weekend that does not involve any children. This is very reasonable and you don\u2019t need to single out her daughter - you just understandably want to spend time with an adult! Drink, eat, talk about adult life topics! \n\nI share a lot of people\u2019s concerns about your friend\u2019s husband though, he sounds controlling and like is using his daughter to keep tabs on his wife.", "\n>>Plus,we shouldn't be doing or saying anything we couldn't in front of their daughter.\n\nYeah that's absolutely nuts. In his mind there is *nothing* two grown ass women would want to talk about that is inappropriate for a child to hear?", "[removed]", "I think it's equally likely that the husband is sexist and doesn't want to or know how to relate to his daughter.  He does \"boy stuff\" with his son(s) and she does \"girl stuff\" with the daughter.", "I thought the same.", "YESSSS You do get it!!!", "He's not doing anything... Literally nothing. He will be sitting in the same place when we leave as when we get back. Gaming control in his hand. The boys are older and don't require as much attention.", "ROFLOL I actually had to tell my brazilian wax story in front of her daughter!!!!! If I didn't then I would have never gotten to tell my friend that my soul left my body at that moment.  I did get \"the look\" that says \"too far, please stop\" from my friend while her daughter kept asking why a wax hurt. LOL", "I tried. Kinda. She asked how one of my high school kids handled a situation. I said \"I don't want to talk about it in front of your daughter, the middle school doesn't need to know about the teacher also\". She said \"oh she won't tell anybody\".  I  thought \"have you met your daughter?\"", "I'm a super safe friend though! I'm not out to get her drunk or laid or ruin either of our families. I want to be in bed by 9:00pm LOL", "I personally feel the child is safe with him. It's just easier for the dad to make Shelly take her than to have to listen to the child whine about being left out. The child has learned to rock the \"I'm the only girl\" card to get her way.", "I don't get that vibe from the family. I feel like it's more of a convenience thing. The dad doesn't have to listen to the non stop chatter, the daughter gets to go do something \" traditionally feminine\" and the mom gets \"bonding time and memories\". I'm the only one left super annoyed and feeling guilty for feeling that way.", "OP says the kid throws fits if she isn\u2019t included in the adult outings and has few friends her own age, so you are clearly wrong on that point.", "or, he doesn't want them to talk about anything they wouldn't want the child to hear.  like marriage problems.", "I was thinking he didn't want them laughing at his bedroom abilities once they get to comparing things.", "I can't remember the comedian, but \"I've lost a lot of friends to kids\".", "i would agree something fishy about the husband is going on", "Start asking friend if she wants women night out no under 21. Sounds nicer than saying I don\u2019t want your child. Had a friend who took her daughter every where with her like your friend girls night too. By 8 this child was convinced she had the same standing as her mom in the group, including being very nasty about other adult friends clothes, hair , jewelry. Child would protest where we were meeting , commenting on adults food and drink choices. You can\u2019t afford to eat the dessert you are already too fat to an adult! Just got to the place we left friend out of gathering. Friend group met when all children in same preschool class, mom with boy was told it was girls night but I had a daughter same age and never brought my child. The one friend daughter was so mature and special. You may have to put friendship on hold till child is embarrassed about going out with Mom. NTA", "And/or being an information conduit back to the father about what went on during the outing. Hell to the no. NTA", "Exactly what I was thinking.", "That's the best case scenario, and it is still pretty grim.", "You claim the daughter is \u201ca great kid\u201d, but she sounds spoiled, jealous, and entitled. Her sexist dad foists her off on her mom, her mom never says no to her, and she thinks adults are her friends and her equals. These are all problems that need addressing, or she will become a bratty teen with no friends and issues with authority figures.", "It certainly doesn't sound like Shelly is in an equal partnership.  If she can't stand up for herself, you certainly can't do it for her. You were right to back out of the trip.  Sounds like daughter is manipulating her father and causing her mother a lot of trouble, too.\n\nSad parenting.", "I guess my main point is if you suspect your friend is being isolated from her friends, systematically and purposefully, keeping a line open and making some compromises might end up being a lifesaver for her. Not that that's your job -- just... Usually with someone so controlling, that's the tip of the iceberg.", "Would she be motivated by what's best for her daughter?  I teach high school and I'm a huge advocate of teenagers spending time with other teens to learn social skills.  Time with adults isn't the same, especially adults who are parents, because it's an unequal relationship that's more about meeting the child's needs than the adult's. But relationships with peers are a two-way street and require the child to learn give and take and to share attention.  By always keeping her daughter with her, your friend could be stunting her child's social development.", "It\u2019s absolutely your place to tell here that her mom is your friend, and that she\u2019s your friend\u2019s child. She may be a child, but she needs to learn that other people can have relationships with one another without her being involved.", ">It's not my place to tell her \"no, you are her child, not my friend\" so I just grit my teeth, grin and bear it, or opt out\n\nIf not you, who?", "Maybe the mother sees her daughter as more a friend than a daughter?\nIts great if they have a good relationship, maybe tell Shelly sometimes you want to talk about more personal stuff you dont want her kids knowing?\n\nHusband might sound controlling somewhat.", "Oof yeah if you\u2019ve already made an effort to include the daughter in plans, you need to have a serious talk with your friend. It seems like she isn\u2019t prioritizing your need to have one on one time with her at all. \n\nI\u2019d have an honest conversation with her about your feelings, and if she still doesn\u2019t respect what you have to say she\u2019s really not a good friend. It should be her job to tell her child that she can\u2019t tag along all the time with you two. Also ngl it\u2019s kinda weird she wants/allows her daughter around that much? I feel like most moms would love to have alone time with friends once in a while\u2026 so maybe something bigger on her side going on? I dunno\n\nAnyways I\u2019d just be honest with her about your feelings. If it comes from a genuine \u201ci miss just the two of us hanging out\u201d or \u201cI feel like I can\u2019t be as open with you when your daughter is around\u201d kinda space I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be more understanding. Best of luck!", "Do it for the sake of her daughter.  The girl needs to have age-appropriate friends.  This might be the wakeup call her mom needs.  It is fine to do some mommy and me activities but at this point in life the girl needs to be branching out and hanging out with girls her own age.  The girl needs to stop seeing herself as a peer to people in her parents age group.", "Could suggest going some place a kid isnt allowed, like a casino or a bar?", "\"Hey Shelly, has your SO asked you to use these vibe toys on his balls? I saw a really weird one the other day and was wondering if they were any good as a surprise for my SO?\"....just keep a str8 face.", "Wow. \n\nThat\u2019s just sad. He needs to pay attention to his kids- all of them.", "Maybe I\u2019m just evil but I would\u2019ve answered without filter- I\u2019d rather them hear it from someone safe and have momental trauma than someone who has never had it done before!", "You need to be much more direct. She either isn\u2019t getting the hint or is pretending she doesn\u2019t get what you are trying to say.", "Teens blab. Drama is pretty much their only form of entertainment until the end of school life.\n\nI guess you just have to take a hard stance with your friend that there are times when you want to just hangout with your friend and BS, like you used to, but if she feels she needs to bring her daughter along every time, that just won't happen.", "Or abuse!", "This is true, some kids dont wanna go, some do.\nI loved all my parents friends, and despite our ages as kids, they had no filter lol.\nThey would talk about whatever they wanted, middle age adult BS. It was honestly kinda fun sometimes.", "THIS!!!!  This is what is happening!!!", "It really only happens with me because I don't have girls to take with me or leave behind. Sometimes we have girls nights where it's only adults, but her daughter really likes me, so if it's just going to be us 2, it's going to be us 3.", "Shock face as realization settles in. You are on to something here.", "That's her moms place. I can't talk to somebody else's child like that. It's super harsh but if I open my mouth, that's what will fly out. And I don't \"dislike\" the child. I don't want to hurt her. I just don't want to be her BFF.", "You are 100% right!!!! She already calls her her best friend or sister. I try not to judge, but I am sooooo judging. lol", "Well I can't keep a straight face, but I don't think anybody should when talking about ball vibes. LOL This is now the plan!", "When I was a preteen I spent a lot of time with my mom and her friends. I was an only child though so I was already used to being around adults a lot and they loved asking me about all of my middle school drama and gossip so I don\u2019t think this immediately means red flags. She\u2019s getting to do something \u201cgrown up\u201d that feels special. \n\nI think you\u2019re definitely NTA for wanting time just the two of you. I also think it\u2019s fair to tell your friend that it\u2019s okay if daughter comes to like 3/4 hang outs but that if every now and then you want to spend time just the two of you that\u2019s not a big ask. If she can\u2019t accommodate that then you\u2019ll just stick to hanging out with all of the kids or not at all. \n\nIt does sound like controlling husband is using daughter as a way to keep tabs and control over his wife. Like she can\u2019t be \u201cpartying with her girlfriends\u201d if her daughter is there.", "Maybe I'm the odd one out. I spent time with my mom all the time. She was as much a friend as she was a parent.", "Sigh, I did not even consider that possibility.", "Politely saying that she is more like a niece and that friends are usually in the same age group would not be too harsh. If you rely on Shelly to tell her, the kid is going to keep believing you are friends and equals.", "Oh no, that poor kid. OP, as kindly as possible, it is abusive for someone to treat their kid like a sibling or \"best friend\". It does so much damage to the child. Your friend and her husband are both failing that girl.   \n\n\nAll you can do is point it out and stand firm, but yeah...that isn't good.", "Do it OP and update us \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude01\n\nNTA", "Same! Only daughter (3 brothers) and I also didn't want to hangout with my moms friends... even less at that age", "I can support this from the other side, I *did* want to hang out with my mom socially at that age and uh turns out that wasn\u2019t actually that great either (in my case my mom was a lot like Amy Poehler in Mean Girls).", "Very true. Valid point. Thank you.", "I was an only girl with several brothers. Never wanted to hang out with my mum, but was sent sometimes to \"keep her safe,\" or report back on if she stayed sober or not. \n\nI might be bias but feels like there's some enmeshment & dysfunction going on in your friends family that is causing her daughter's suprise presence in all your plans. Especially if it is being dropped last minute- I'd be dropped in last minute to my own awareness too. \n\nSucks that you miss out connecting with your friend on an adult level, but can't complain about missing her when the solution would be another \"girls night\" which really isn't the socialisation you're craving!"]}
