I have a family of all boys, as does she, except her youngest, which is a girl. Our kids get along great and have been raised pretty much as cousins. We do a lot of things with our kids all together. The problem is when I want to spend time with just Shelly, she will bring her daughter without warning and say \"I thought we were having a girls night\". It feels underhanded and  intrusive.\r  \n   This has gone on for a number of years and always gotten under my skin. I know her husband is a bit controlling and doesn't let Shelly go many places without her daughter. He says Shelly needs to take her and \u201cteach her to be a girl\u201d (whatever that means) since she has all brothers. Plus,we shouldn't be doing or saying anything we couldn't in front of their daughter.\r  \n   I feel like if any of the kids get to come, they all should get the option. It shouldn\u2019t be just the daughter \u201cbecause she\u2019s a girl\u201d, excluding my kids because they are boys, and there are more of them.\r  \nI don't have a problem with the girl at all. She is a great kid! But she is not my \"friend\". I don't want to hang out with a pre-teen girl. I don\u2019t want her hearing what\u2019s going on in my life. I don\u2019t want her juvenile input into adult situations. And I sure don\u2019t want her repeating everything at the middle school lunch tables the next day. I feel like an asshole just saying that, but it\u2019s true.\r  \n   It all came to a head when Shelly wanted to take a trip together as a \"friendversary\" of sorts, without the kids. Absolutely! I'm all in! Date set, location, visions of toes in the sand with drinks in hand........and then she lets it slip that her daughter is coming. (Eyeroll, of course, should have known.)\r  \nI'm out.\r  \nI politely declined. I told her I didn't think I was going to go. She asked why. I said I thought we weren\u2019t bringing the kids. She said it's a girls trip. I told her, either we are taking the kids, and mine are included, or it\u2019s just adults. Shelly got super upset and began telling me how disappointed her daughter would be, and how her daughter wanted it to be \u201cjust us girls\u201d.\r  \nSometimes I just miss my friend, having a drink, and talking about inappropriate middle age women bullshit without the daughter. \r  \nIf I say that, it hurts Shelly's feelings and she thinks I don't like her daughter.\r  \n\r  \nAITA for wanting to back out of every social situation every time she includes her daughter?\n\n\r  \n\\*TLDR: My friend always brings her daughter \"because she is a girl\" when we hang out.

Tell her gender has nothing to do it and you're not going to exclude your sons from things because they have penises. Age is the only factor here- either it's an adults trip and you're in or it's not and you're out. Guilt tripping you because her husband does it to her is not acceptable.", "NTA - adults need adult time sometimes. It sounds like Shelly is simply appeasing her controlling husband. You are allowed to want to have a drink with your friend without monitoring your behavior.", "NTA - my oldest friends and I have recently started taking girls weekends - adults only - and we all have girls around the same teen\u2019ish age\u2026.we would never think to include them on an adults ladies weekend away.", "Strong NTA.  There's a difference between girls and women. There's a difference between adult friends and friends' relationships with each other's children. If you can weather this and you think the friendship is worth it, you can either suck it up or have a serious conversation with your friend and don't allow her to make it about anything other than what it really is: her child chaperone.  \n\nOpenly ask her if there's a serious reason for including her child; is she worried to leave her daughter alone with her husband and/or brothers? It's hard for me to believe that your friend actually does think this is OK. Maybe she has other concerns. Maybe there's a possibility that her daighter can stay with a friend instead.\n\nPersonally, I would prepare a \"spontaneous\" lesson plan for every time I was with the daughter involving freedom, reproductive rights, the constitution, forgotten women heroes, tolerance, anything that helps her to become a strong individual and fight her father's brainwashing.  Your friend wants her to be one of the girls? Then help her a strong one. Either that, or always bring your own children under the assumption that children are invited. Don't allow distinctions along gender lines.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s reasonable you want to have time with your friend, alone. I can understand maybe there is a certain level of filtering that you have to do when her kid is present, so I can totally empathize with you not wanting her along all the time.\n\nIt seems like your friend wants her daughter to have a relationship with you, so maybe if you\u2019re inclined, you can have a \u201cgirls day\u201d where the daughter is invited (maybe getting nails done or something?). This could satisfy your friend and maybe give you more wiggle room to invite your friend to hangout with just the two of you.", "NTA Your friend's husband can't be bothered to watch his daughter. By your own admission he's controlling. However, that's the dynamic of her marriage and her problem to resolve.\n\nShe needs to accept not everyone of her friend's is going to want her daughter tagging along when they get together. Adults with children need to spend time with other adults and enjoy adult conversations without their children. Your friends may get offended but it's just a basic fact of life. And if she insists her daughter tag along on outings, she needs to accept people will not be on board and prefer to cancel plans because her child will not be welcome everywhere, all the time.", "NTA with a kind of big HOWEVER. It really sounds like something isn't right with this family. It's weird that the daughter isn't being encouraged to find her own friends. The husband's controlling behavior probably means your friend is feeling a lack of autonomy within this situation.  A lot of sexist subtext in the situation, too. Agree on all that.  \n\n\nIf he's a controller, then he's killing 2 birds with 1 stone: getting his daughter supervised and preventing his wife from doing things she can't do with her kid along. The daughter's presence also might inhibit your friend from discussing the larger problems with that relationship.  \n\n\nTo me, it sounds like your friend might really need a friend right now and also need to get away from her husband, whether she is feeling pressure to have her daughter along or not.  It might be possible to have her along, but plan some activities for her, like a rafting or horseback tour or something while you get some adult time.", "NTA in the slightest - there is a difference between girly dates where you do cute stuff with kids - and a women\u2019s only weekend away.

Reading all of your posts it sounds like the daughter is the golden child.  She demands attention from mom all of the time and dad backs it up.  Time to take a step back from her as a friend, not just the girl time thing but in total.  Hard for the families but she needs to have her daughter understand that you are and adult friend of the parents.  The daughter needs to understand that you are not her BFF.

That as a mother yourself, you want some time with just adults to relax and hang out. If she doesn't feel she can do that without her daughter present, that's fine and you will plan accordingly, but it will also limit the things you agree to do together.
