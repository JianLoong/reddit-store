My SIL dropped him off at my house yesterday for me and my husband to talk to him, and for Sal to talk to him as well.

I say you\u2019re NTA. I think Tom is old enough to know the consequences of his actions and even if he wasn\u2019t it shouldn\u2019t have been your daughters job to have this talk with him.

All you say is, \u201cI\u2019m sorry my daughter hurt the feelings of your son who is physically assaulting small children where you live. From now on we\u2019ll be staying out of it.
