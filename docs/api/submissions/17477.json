I find it odd that he hasn\u2019t spoken up about Kate literally miss-naming his child\n\n(I actually highly discourage you from doing this, but you could always start calling Kate Caitlyn or Katherine or any other name that normally gets the nickname Kate. This is super petty and would bring you down to her level, so don\u2019t do it)", "Calling someone by the name they prefer should be easy, ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS ACTUALLY THEIR NAME. She embarrassed herself. Keep sticking up for yourself.\n\nNTA.", "NTA she's known you long enough to know your bloody name and use it", "NTA.\n\nJust start calling her Cathy whenever she does it.", "NTA but where in the f\\*ck is your father in this? So happy for you that her own family called her out! But seriously where is your father. He's just letting his gf disrespect his daughter?? \n\nLike even if your name was Andrea and you still preferred Andi, then that's all the information anyone needs. Anything else is just purposely being terrible and difficult\n\nAlso I would've been so petty and called her Katrina or Kathy or something else every time she said the wrong name until she got the point.", "NTA but Kati sure is.  Two can play that game.  She\u2019s an adult and should know better to treat you with respect.", "NTA. Learning your actual NAME is the lowest freaking bar. Have you asked your dad to step in about this?", "NTA.  Would she answer if you called her Susan?", "NTA. she embarrassed herself and is lashing out on you for it.", "NTA. I think this tells us a lot about Kate, unfortunately. If I was meeting a partner's child, parent, sibling, I'd make damn sure I got their name right. It's about respect. Sounds like she's trying to push some boundaries here.", "NTA and she should have called you by your actual name from the beginning. More importantly, your dad should have told her that Andi is your actual name, not Andrea, and stopped her from calling a different name, especially when you told her not to.", "NTA. Names are important in social and professional settings. Showing you took the time to remember someone's name by using it shows that you have some degree of respect for the person.\n\nFailing to use your proper name shows that she's doesn't respect you, either intentionally or unintentionally. \n\nLack of the ability to remember names of significant people in your life could be a sign of mental illness.", "NTA. You told her your name. She chose to ignore that - it wouldn't even matter if your full name was Andrea, she would still be ignoring your wishes.\n\nShe embarrassed herself, you had nothing to do with it.", "NTA. You corrected her and she continued to call you the wrong name. It's not different than if your name was Sarah and she called you Andrea. You shouldn't still have to correct someone three years later. AT that point it looks willful and makes her an AH. Hopefully, after being made fun of by her family, she will remember now.", "NTA Even if your name had technically been Andrea, she would still be in the wrong for not calling you your preferred name. That your name actually is Andi, not Andrea, makes it even worse and since she had been corrected before she has no right to claim ignorance. Any embarrassment resulting from her assumptions and insistence on calling you Andrea is entirely her fault.", "NTA.  Kate got busted on her stupidity and she is trying to project it onto OP.  Question:  why wasn't Dad sticking up for Andi in this?  He should have nipped that shit in the bud a long time ago.", "Nope. NTA. Kate chose to continually call you the wrong name when you'd corrected her. She embarrassed herself. I would hope that your dad stands up for you on this one. His new wife shouldn't be calling you insulting names because she refused to use your correct name.", "NTA, and she embarrassed herself. Your name is your name, and if your stepmom can't be bothered to get it right - even after you corrected her - it really says a lot about her level of care and concern for you.", "NTA - You've discussed it with her, you gave her notice. She f\\*ked around and found out.\n\nShe disrespected you by not even learning your name. And she wants to cry disrespect?", "You're NTA, young one. Calling you by your preferred name, nickname or no, is the most basic human respect.  \n\nYou didn't embarrass Kate. She embarrassed herself.  I strongly recommend calling her nothing but Princess Consuela Bananahammock in the future until she learns to call you Andi.", "NTA.  \nI'll even go out on a limb and guess that \"Kate\" is actually a nickname for your dad's fianc\u00e9e and not her legal name.  If this is true, then the irony of the situation has Kate going to 11 on the AH scale.  She prefers to be called by a nickname, but for you, for some AH passive aggressive, dumba$$ reason, she insists on calling you by what she thinks is your legal name.  (and she's wrong about that).  So, for hypocrisy's sake, she wants to be called a nickname, meaning she wants people to respect the right to someone to pick their own name, but for some reason, has decided that you don't have that right?  And then Kate (or maybe I should call her Katherine?) gets mad because you didn't engage in her stupidity?    \n\n\nMaintain your policy of not answering to someone else's name.  If \"Kate\" has a problem, start calling her by her legal name until she pulls her head out to look for a clue.", "NTA.  Your name is your name.  If it isn\u2019t some derivative of such ie Tommy or Tom for Thomas, then you shouldn\u2019t be called such.  Your name is Andi, not Andrea.  You were right to not answer to anything that isn\u2019t your name.", "Speaking as someone whose full legal name is often a nickname for a longer name, NTA!  Seriously, she couldn't be bothered to listen to you in all this time?  She's mad because she realized her complete lack of care has been exposed.", "I guess she thought you were just insisting on a nickname, which still makes her an AH. HOWEVER, in three years your dad never corrected her? Wow...\n\nNTA. Your dad should have explained to her a long time ago and this could all have been avoided.", "NTA. Your name is Andi, why would you answer to another name? \n\nYou should show Katherine this post.", "NTA, she may have assumed Andi was short for Andrea as well, but she should apologize for having made that incorrect assumption and own up to her mistake. On the other hand, if she was just being disrespectful and deliberately calling you by another name then she should own up to that and apologize. It speaks volumes to the type of person she is if she has no humility.", "NTA, Kate embarrassed herself by continually calling you the wrong name. Don't ever answer to Andrea, if you do it once it'll be giving her validation to continue to call you by that name.", "You were not being as AH. People need to call you by the name you prefer and if not they are the AH.", "Tell her - its not my fault that you are shitty step mother that cant remember my name \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude11\nNTA at all....", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
