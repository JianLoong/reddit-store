You corrected her and she continued to call you the wrong name. It's not different than if your name was Sarah and she called you Andrea.

Hopefully, after being made fun of by her family, she will remember now.", "NTA Even if your name had technically been Andrea, she would still be in the wrong for not calling you your preferred name. That your name actually is Andi, not Andrea, makes it even worse and since she had been corrected before she has no right to claim ignorance.

She prefers to be called by a nickname, but for you, for some AH passive aggressive, dumba$$ reason, she insists on calling you by what she thinks is your legal name.  (and she's wrong about that).  So, for hypocrisy's sake, she wants to be called a nickname, meaning she wants people to respect the right to someone to pick their own name, but for some reason, has decided that you don't have that right?  And then Kate (or maybe I should call her Katherine?) gets mad because you didn't engage in her stupidity?    \n\n\nMaintain your policy of not answering to someone else's name.

Seems like the stepmom is going to have her own family giving her shit for it soon enough. Honestly all op needs to do is continue publicly asserting this boundary and everyone else in the stepmoms life will probably do the rest. Public shame is a powerful motivator and she clearly cares what people thing of her otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be bothered by her family\u2019s reaction. IF the stepmom escalates from there then further steps might be needed but that isn\u2019t the case so far. \n\nI also want to flip the script here, instead of \u201cwhy should she be responsible for resolving this conflict her stepmother started\u201d to \u201cwhy should she be the one sacrificing her relationship with her father (even if that\u2019s just financial or whatever) to resolve this conflict her stepmother started. Talking to her father or going no contact, no matter what she is the one who is going to have to take steps to resolve this conflict. Avoiding conflict is just as much an active choice as facing it, so the question isn\u2019t should she have to do something but rather what\u2019s the easiest thing for her to do. I kinda doubt publicly denying her stepmothers disrespect for a few weeks is going to be harder than completely removing her father from her life. Shit she\u2019s a minor and her parents are divorced this could require a court order to do. I think there are a lot of steps left to try before going to court and changing a custody agreement. \n\nThe simple fact is \u201ccut them out\u201d is the gold standard for \u201ceasier said than done\u201d.

It\u2019s always \u201cright\u201d and will always solve the problem presented, while ignoring all the new problems it creates. Sure their ain\u2019t no armed conflict that can\u2019t be solved with a nuke, but if the conflict is in your home you might not be so quick to push for it. \n\nIt\u2019s much harder to actually evaluate the situation and try and find a solution that would resolve the conflict and maintain the relationships benefits.

The challenges are dependent on the situation of the person but it\u2019s rarely a simple step. It\u2019s just easier to give as advice because it can be surmised in a single paragraph. Cutting her stepmother and by extension father out of her life is very likely going to be way more than just one and done and is going to be way more stressful for her than anyone is putting here. It\u2019s a often necessary step but it\u2019s usually the hardest solution and should really be saved as a final step for just that reason. \n\nWe know she doesn\u2019t live with her father but we have no idea what the plan is for her future support, is her father paying for college, her adult life, does she depend on him for health insurance. Depending on the severity of the situation these are all things than can be forgone if it\u2019s bad enough, leaving a violent or abusive household can absolutely be worth the temporary loss of shelter, healthcare or financial support but this has not yet risen to anything close to that. \n\nSometimes in life you have to interact with disrespectful and rude or just outright hostile people and sometimes their are easier ways to deal with them. The issue is these middle steps require more social confrontation and interaction and to most people here that seems to be fat to steep a price to to pay. That and a culture of assuming the worse means everyone assumes that victimizer will or can never change. But in real life that isn\u2019t always true, sometimes people just have a blind spot and don\u2019t realize how dickish their being until it\u2019s presented to them in the right way or they just don\u2019t realize what their doing and yea sometimes people are just dicks too. Yea it should be anyone\u2019s job to make someone else not be a dick to them, sometimes that\u2019s just easier than the process of removing someone closely intertwined in their lives. Either for emotional or logistical reasons. \n\nActively removing her father from her life is going to take significantly more work than simply re-asserting this boundary. Clearly the stepmother is has no peer support on her stance, and is only maintaining it out of spite at this point. All op needs to do is stay firm and keep doing exactly what she is, and either her stepmother will give up when she realizes she is only loosing by staying on this hill, OR is going to burn herself and all her bridges trying to hang firm here and eventually will be removed from OP\u2019s life by others (as in acting so crazy either her father divorces or people stop inviting the father around at all because of his wife). OR worst case senario the people in her life are all selfish and unreasonable (but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case, stepmoms own family laughed at her) and she can progressively remove her father from her life anyway as it becomes a clear dead end. \n\nI can say with fair confidence that re-asserting and maintaining her boundaries with her stepmother and possibly taking some distance, depending on the stepmom\u2019s disposition, will be way easier than actively trying to avoid and cut out her father and his wife all the time. At a minimum if most people around are reasonable (as they seem to be) even if she\u2019s actively a bitch and just hates you, she\u2019ll stop doing it when she realizes everyone else will shun her for it and just avoid you herself to avoid catching any heat.
