You corrected her and she continued to call you the wrong name. It's not different than if your name was Sarah and she called you Andrea.

Hopefully, after being made fun of by her family, she will remember now.", "NTA Even if your name had technically been Andrea, she would still be in the wrong for not calling you your preferred name. That your name actually is Andi, not Andrea, makes it even worse and since she had been corrected before she has no right to claim ignorance.

She prefers to be called by a nickname, but for you, for some AH passive aggressive, dumba$$ reason, she insists on calling you by what she thinks is your legal name.  (and she's wrong about that).  So, for hypocrisy's sake, she wants to be called a nickname, meaning she wants people to respect the right to someone to pick their own name, but for some reason, has decided that you don't have that right?  And then Kate (or maybe I should call her Katherine?) gets mad because you didn't engage in her stupidity?    \n\n\nMaintain your policy of not answering to someone else's name.
