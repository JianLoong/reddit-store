With so big an age gap, and him having kids, your priorities will be different.

His kids will always come first, you have to understand that. Gfs come and go but they will be his kids forever. You will almost always be second to them and he is a good dad for wanting to spend so much time with them.\n\nIf you struggle with that I suggest you find a guy that isn't married. Maybe someone closer to your own age so they have more energy to stay up late on weeknights.", "Honestly.... NAH.  \n\n\nYou aren't in the wrong for wanting intimate time and attention from your partner.  The big roadblock here is that he has different priorities.  He is a father and his kids will always come before you, and there is really nothing you can do about it.  You are going to have to accept this if you wish to continue pursuing this relationship.  \n\n\nAlso, he's twice your age.  He 100% has different ideas on what makes up an enjoyable night out with the partner.  When my wife and I go out on dates, I find that the dates I enjoy the most are the ones where we just hang out and talk.  The food, the venue, and literally everything else is less important than that.

You knew what you were getting into.", "I would've said NTA until I saw you start losing your cool at people's responses. \n\nI get wanting alone time with your partner. As a parent of 4, I know sometimes it can be the one thing you desperately want. I also know it's sometimes the one thing you can't get, at least in the way you want it. \n\nYou seem to lack the maturity to understand how life with kids works. If his ex is unreliable or high conflict, he's aware of that and compensating for it the best way he can and it's for the good of his children. \n\nThat being said, for the simple reason you're losing your cool on people you've asked advice from, YTA.

Also, based off vibes alone, it\u2019s pretty freaking weird that he got a divorce, and then decided that dating someone half his age was the right move. From what I\u2019ve noticed, men who do that kind of thing are more likely to disrespect you and have convoluted perspectives on consent and how to treat women. Chances are, dating someone closer to your age will feel like a breath of fresh air, because they will actually understand your perspective more.", "NAH.

What are you going to do if, god forbids, anything happens to the mother and he has to take full custody?? You\u2019ll just keep throwing a tantrum 24/7 about having the kids around too much??", "That's part of being a parent.  Most parents feel the same way at times,  that they just need adult time.  But it's just not always possible.", "you're not getting it. lashing out here won't get you it. he's not committed to you. i am sorry. the way he treats you and doesn't seem to know you seems to show it's a good thing he's not committed to you in the long run but i know it is painful to confront. but the bare fact of it is you want him to honour his promise of quality time for you and you have given him more than your fair share and you're becoming resentful but none of this will change him. spare yourself further anguish. he won't give you what you want or need. he has already shown you this. you just need to come to terms with it.", "Then don't date a man with kids!  How many times has it been said to you in this thread?  \n\nThat is his time with his kids.  You have Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  \n\nDeal with it or move tf on.", "Then maybe this isn't the best person to build a life with?", "What are you not getting. He. Cannot. Just. Abandon. His. Custody. Time. Especially not for some trivial date night that should take place when the kids aren\u2019t there. And if you can\u2019t schedule one during that time. Then that\u2019s a you problem for the adults to start acting like adults and solve. My god", "Yea this is why I don\u2019t date parents. I want to come first but I don\u2019t date parents and then insist they dump their kids for me.", "Haha agreed"]}
