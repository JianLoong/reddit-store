It was your room and your brother-in-law took it without asking.  \n\nI'll tell you who is the AH though--your husband.  He should have stopped his brother from moving into your room.  And he should be the one dealing with his brother right now because it's his brother.  You should deal with any problems involving your relatives and your husband should manage problems involving his.\n\nThe reason for this is that your brother-in-law will care more about damaging his relationship with your husband than he will care about offending you.  Also, your husband knows his brother best.  The way to get the problem solved is for your husband to be the one dealing with it.  Your husband should WANT to solve this problem so you're not unhappy.", "It sort of depends on who owns the house.

It's your house,  not his", "INFO: Whose actually owns the house?", "INFO: Was there always an understanding that the move out wasn't permanent?\n\nIn the end, tho, you have a husband problem. Ignore the people trying to decide who owns it because, in the end, if you are staying together with your husband and living together, it is your home. Inlaws letting husband live there is no different than being renters, and it would still not be cool to move out someone else's stuff if it was known you were supposed to come back. Even if it wasn't known, that you are back now does change the equation because it is your marital home. \n\nHusband isn't going to back you over brother is the lesson you learned from this. Do with that knowledge whatever you will.", "Who's name is the house in? If it's in your husband, then NTA, but if it's still in the in-laws, then it's more of the BIL'S house than yours. So, who does the house actually belong to?", "I think normally I'd say NTA but I don't think you're in-laws ever actually transferred ownership of the house to your husband. Mostly based on your word choice. Did your BIL live in this house before with his parents? If your husband isn't the legal homeowner then definitely YTA. Let us know who owns the house.", "Put a lock on the door in case he tries to move it back.

Maybe you should move back out and reconsider divorce?", "INFO: who owns the house??", "I was thinking move his stuff out then further reading see you did. And you were nice enough to not make him look like you dumped everything for him to put back together like a moving van workers just put all inside and left. I am not sure I would have been so nice. He is lucky he is living there still. As it\u2019s not his home. And it\u2019s your home too with your husband. Your space with hubby. His rights ended when your husband took you back and you went back. He is luckier his stuff wasn\u2019t put in the yard.", "YTA. You moved out and he moved in. You assume just because \"there were other rooms he could've chosen\" that he was being spiteful, but you nothing to back that up. Instead, it sounds perfectly rational that whatever attributes made the room a good library also made it a good office.\n\nWhere you really became the AH was in your childish response of waiting until your BIL was traveling then evicted him from the room.", "YTA. Also, the irony of you accusing him of choosing the office to be spiteful - then doing something super spiteful is fucking hilarious.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Secondly your hubs let him do so as the rightful owner. Thirdly if you're on the verge of divorce than you really don't have a leg to stand on.", "Its your house? Put his crap outside and tell him to kick rocks. He doesn't get to negotiate with you about living in YOUR space.\n\nNTA.", "NTA- and your husband should shut that down if he wants to stay married to you.\n\nBecause the way your brother-in-law is acting is treating you like you're not there for permanent.", "ESH...\n\nFirst, the husband for allowing his brother to change anything in the home he 'shared' with his wife. You don't say why you lived apart, but BIL shouldn't have done anything in the home--even if it was his childhood home. Husband is also not wanting to rock the boat with his brother by making him move, which doesn't make much sense to me as you're back and I assume, trying to make things work? Husband needs the brother to prepare to move out of the home.\n\nI don't think you should have changed the office back into the library before you and BIL had an understanding and I don't think you should have done it behind his back while he was away. Your marriage seems fragile at this moment and everyone needs to be working towards resolution together.\n\nBIL because he shouldn't have changed anything in the home and he needs to be on his way towards moving out. He can see that this couple needs some time alone to get on track. His pettiness is damaging.", "NTA. But I must warn you that the house is mostly your husband's house. From his own parents. \nYou can take this 2-week to conect with your husband not the house itself. For example: ask your husband which color does he likes the most and than paint the library. Ask your husband which furniture he likes the most (in the library) and the make some action with him on top of the furniture. Ask your husband which is his favorite cute-couple name calling, than change the wifi password to that (you can complicate by Honey = hOn3y). \nBy the way... why were you away for 1-year?", "NTA you did exactly what he did to you", "I had to re-read, a couple of times, to figure out exactly what happened here.  Who gives a rats behind what your BIL thinks, it's YOUR and your husbands house, NOT HIS.  Tell him to get his crap and move out.  NTAH.", "YTA to yourself.\n\nIf your husband isn't defending you, then he's not on your side. He's not just  acting like he doesn't care about you. He's screaming it while waving a giant country sized red flag.\n\nThis is your marriage. That is your house. You don't request your library back. You tell them that it's yours. They haven't been doing anything about it because they've been using you as a doormat. You've set the dynamic of just stirring some trouble that they can ignore because they'll still get what they want.\n\nWhy is your BIL in your marriage and in your house?", "YTA because it's not your house and not your room. Psycho, much?", "Op was gone for a year, so BIL may have asked the husband and got the okay.  Still, OP is back now and it is theirs and their husbands house and room.  OP is NTA.", "My husband owns the house", "Agreed. Saying they were \"essentially\" gifted the house is making me think OP might be obfuscating the truth quite a bit.", "Pretty unlikely its her or the husband's house. If it was gifted to them it wouldn't have been \"essentially\" gifted.", "Husbands House, and they might get divorced.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually either of their homes. Based on OPs wording I think her husband is acting as more of a caretaker of the home vs having their names on the deed.", "Not her house. Probably not even the husband's house. Sounds like it belongs to the 2 brothers' parents, and husband is acting as the parents' caretaker, but OP hasn't responded to requests for info on that.", "If there were other available rooms, this should never have been all right from the husband or the BIL. It sounds spiteful on the BIL's part and indifferent/weak-willed on the husband's, if not also spiteful.", "Difficult to say with marital laws.  Did parents  put the son's  name on the deed.", "If they live in the US and in a community property state, then the house is half hers.", "\nIt's a marital home. Regardless who owns it, trying to lord that over your partner never ends well for a reason", "I see, in her case then it would be YOU MOVE, YOU LOSE. And she was gone a long time and established residence elsewhere if they were separated. As she didn\u2019t mention she had to work away from him like can happen if serving military. Seeing not enough info to validate her."]}
