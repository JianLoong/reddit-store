Currently, the children share a room and the 3rd bedroom is my office (I work from home). Lydia understandably does not want to share a room with her 6-year old brother anymore, and she has asked if we could turn my office into her room. I told her that if I am going to be giving up my office, I\u2019ll want some compensation. I thought it would be a good life lesson on the real world if I charged her rent, 5 dollars a month. Lydia protested, saying that she is not old enough to get a job, but I know she has a lot of birthday money and tooth fairy money she\u2019s never spent, and 5 dollars a month will not be hard for her to scrape together. Am I the a-hole?\n\nEdit: My wife is O.K with this because we would not be keeping the money, we would be putting this in a savings account for her, we just want her to know that you need to sacrifice something to have nice things. Also, to the people who were asking, we don\u2019t have a basement or a mud room I could turn into an office. The only other rooms we have are a bathroom, a dining room, living room, and kitchen. \nIn the end, we have decided that Lydia should start helping around the house (loading the dishwasher and taking out the trash) if she is going to get a new  room. \nI saw somebody ask about if her bio dad is in her life, and sadly he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with her.", "created_utc": 1676238914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110rf7c/aita_for_making_my_12year_old_stepdaughter_pay/", "score": 1198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lydia protested, saying that she is not old enough to get a job, but I know she has a lot of birthday money and tooth fairy money she\u2019s never spent, and 5 dollars a month will not be hard for her to scrape together.

No kid is entitled to privacy and sharing a bedroom with your brother is not some form of abuse or neglect.  Lots of kids out there don\u2019t have their own bed let alone their own room.  Having your own bedroom as a kid is a luxury that not every parent can afford and if this girl isn\u2019t happy with what is provided for her she should absolutely bear the cost of an upgrade.

If you have the space, and you clearly do, your 12 year old daughter should have her own room, away from her 6 year old brother, who likely has a different sleep schedule than her.

She\u2019s just some dude\u2019s kid that you are stuck with. \n\nWill this mean that the 6 year old will pay rent as well?

Another thing, it's a good intention to keep the money in savings for her, but what's the point of her paying when she's just going to get it back? She should know what rent is at 12, but she shouldn't have to pay it. She should know how to deal with her money wisely, but not when all she has is tooth fairy and birthday money.
