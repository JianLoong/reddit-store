Your sister should have made sure things were put away and she didn\u2019t.

I agree the relationship is strained but I believe you are finding it more serious than either one of us are. I am slightly miffed in regards to the situation. But nothing to the level I believe you are implying.", "You are correct and I am not doing that in my mind.

The items I am referring to aren't the real issue it's the principle of the matter.", "Yea, kids aren't perfect by any means. That isn't the problem in my mind. My issue is that my sister allows and even at times encourages her daughter to blantly disrespect me and my things alot. I think it has to do with underlying trauma from our father and the fact that I am a spitting image of him with admittedly a quarter of the toxic behavior. We are humans, after all and beyond, perfect.", "Because the economy is shit and we have very little choices ATM.", "You get that they now have two disney+ accounts in the same household, right?", "My neice you mean. And I feel like your comment isn't that related to the topic.", "Correct. Mother owns but does not live with us, father hasn't been in the picture in a very long time.", "No, that is not the problem here. You think sister/niece should have suffered without a Disney account because you decided it. You think she should \u201callow the punishment\u201d and it\u2019s wrong for her to buy her own.", "The more you comment to defend yourself, the more you need to defend yourself.

If you find the kid irritating she will feel it in your energy and she may be responding to that. I understand it\u2019s not your kid but u have to extend children some grace, i would think the vast majority of children don\u2019t misbehave with intent to hurt you like adults do. You sister can see you find her kid annoying and is basically protecting her from you and replacing anything that gets damaged. Don\u2019t judge the actions of children as if they are an adult.", "Yes it is! And that sux. Im sorry. Im sure that is not pleasent", "What is he thinking?! Is he crazy?", "You like El\ud83e\udd2cmental???", "I disagree. OP was doing a favor for sister and daughter by giving access to his account.

I do see what you are saying, but the you are in the minority so I think your POV is more about you and your experiences then me and what I am doing.", "If that was defending myself, I did a horrible job, because I respectfully heard every opinion and stated simply that I disagreed when so. I imagine a defense to actually go into detail. Also from my math it was a split decision at worst.", "No I just want to not be treated like dirt by an 11 year old.

What does the length of time have to do with anything?\n\nSounds like you wanted to be able to keep holding it over her head and threatening to take it away at any time to control her behaviour. You wanted her under your thumb. She had the nerve to ruin your plan by getting her own account.\n\nThere is an obvious solution here. If I lived in a house with a pool (free or cheap, right?) and a child in the house kept leaving my floaties and goggles outside, then I would keep them away from the kid and tell her parent to buy their own. Instead you\u2019ve tried to engineer this bizarre situation where you can control them by threatening to withhold Disney at any time. You\u2019re angry that you can\u2019t control her and she is laughing at your sad attempts at trying. How on earth did you not foresee that she might just ignore your bullshit and spend a few dollars on Disney?", "NTA!", "Amazon Prime video is a garbage steaming service in my mind, I forgot to mention that our mother pays for it also. Because she is a single mother, our mother pays for a lot of her needs, and I am a single male who pays for everything myself. I'm leaving out a lot of details that would paint her in a bad light because until they are relevant, why point them out. I love my little sister but she's always had it easier than I have.

You\u2019re just refusing to address this because you disagree with it.

Totally the AH here.", "Ok, thank you for your input.\nBut that's unrelated to the hissy fit I was referring to.", "Punishments should be commensurate and related to the offence. The punishment for niece was to remove her access to your goggles and float (that\u2019s the transgression you mention for her). The Disney+ punishment for your niece is not just and therefore teaches her no lesson beyond \u2018adults have power and you don\u2019t\u2019. So for that YTA.", "NTA.", "NTA but it sounds like you're not too bright when it comes to petty punishments.  Didn't really go the way you pictured it did it?", "It sounds like, from reading some of your other comments, this issue goes beyond the pool toys and argument - seems like you have a lot of underlying resentment for your sister for being \"spoiled\" and \"entitled\" and you're taking that resentment out on her and your niece.  Obviously we get one side of the story here, but if your sister is really as entitled as all that, your best option is to find someone else to room with as soon as you can.\n\nYou can't change their attitude or behavior, but you can set boundaries and remove yourself from them, giving yourself greater peace of mind.  If they are truly as self-centered as you've indicated, they will reap what they sow sooner or later.\n\nNTA", "I tried that first, she just bought her, her own which she left in the sun and destroyed. The actual lesson is that only mommy has power, and no one else can tell you anything about anything and If handled better , it is not a bad lesson. But in the real world, it isn't a great lesson in my mind. I am kind of worried about how the world will treat her when she goes out into it. That's mainly what i try to impart to my neice.", "To the contrary it actually went exactly the way I pictured it. That my sister wouldn't allow me to stand up for myself and would undermine my efforts.", "You are completely correct. I'm just worried that when she is faced with the real world, the lesson of mom is always right, and that is the only way that won't work out too well for my neice.", "All the research shows that the way to prepare kids for the \u2018real world\u2019 is to make them feel loved and safe so that they learn self-worth. This means that when they go out in the \u2018real world\u2019 they respect themselves enough, feel loved enough, and have deep emotional reserves to be resilient in the face of adversity and recognise when they\u2019re being treated abusively. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t impart lessons about the consequences of behaviour, but you explain what you are doing and why (including how you feel), and WHY it is commensurate with the behaviour from them that had a negative impact on you. \n\nTeaching kids that the adults who love them are petty dicks doesn\u2019t help them prepare for reality. It just undermines the security of the home. \n\nBe a role model for your niece and be explicit about it; explain to her how your respectful behaviour is respectful and why it\u2019s important. Teach her the positives approaches to life her mum isn\u2019t teaching her, rather than trying to impose whatever punishments you think her mother is failing to impose. \n\nTBH this entire thing seems mostly to be about you thinking your sister is a bad mother. Don\u2019t double down by being a shit uncle.", "Oh I stand corrected. Clearly you're a next level genius.", "Not in the least, but when something happens numerous times, you start to pick up the pattern.", "Elemental is a new Disney movie that is about a fire creature and water element creature I'm assuming falling in love and figuring out how to balance their differences to be able to work together and be together. While also making it known that even two worlds so different can still live in peace with each other.\n\nI'm gonna assume it's similar to Romeo and Juliet but a LOT more kid friendly and less...well Shakespeare in general. Just from the previews I've seen. It's a cute kids movie. That's it.\n\nBut people are assuming it's about race (interracial relationships since fire and water are so different) or something like that. It's nothing life changing it's for kids and prolly adults with some of the jokes I'm sure it has", "This makes you sound very childish.\n\nIf you\u2019re not bothered by losing Amazon Prime, why post?", "Does no one understand the importance of principle? I'm posting because I have been made to believe by her friends and part of our family that I am in the wrong for finally have enough of the blant disrespect received  by my sister and her daughter. The things aren't the issue, but without them, the post would be tiny, and there wouldn't be any context."]}
