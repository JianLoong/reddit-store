A couple of weeks ago I agreed and a double date was planned for last night. The plan was that my buddy and I was going to pick up his girlfriend and her cousin at 7 and go to dinner. We picked the restaurant and I made a reservation for 8 (it\u2019s 30 mins from her place). Everyone was in on the planning so everyone know the schedule.\n\nWe arrived at her place at 6:45 and they\u2019re not ready. We were early so it\u2019s not a big deal. My buddy and I sit and talk until 7:15. He jokingly reminds his girlfriend we have a reservation then comments to me that she always cut things close. At 7:30, I\u2019m getting a little annoyed that we\u2019re cutting it so close. They come out at 7:45 to say they\u2019re almost done then go into her bedroom. 8 rolls around and at this point I\u2019m in a bad mood since it\u2019s an hour pass when we were supposed to leave. About 10 mins later, I get up to leave and my buddy tries to talk me out of it. At this point I was livid for having to wait over an hour and missing the reservation. Since I made the reservation, they charged me $25 for missing the reservation. \n\nThis morning my buddy and his GF texted and called me to tell me what a jerk I was for leaving our planned double date. I defended myself but they argued we could have gone somewhere else and that I ruined the night for everyone. They want me to apologize but I steadfastly refused. Now I\u2019m not only an ass but according to them, a stubborn jerk.", "created_utc": 1697996397, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dyq9c/aita_for_leaving_a_double_date_before_it_started/", "score": 258, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And tell them they owe you $25.", "NTA. I hate people like that. Being so late messes with everyone, from the wait staff to the kitchen to YOU. They aren't worth wasting a moment's thought.

That's the real reason they didn't mind about going somewhere else.\n\nThey didn't value his choice of restaurant or his time.

That's also pretty shitty because it wasn't her fault.", "It's understandable that you were frustrated by the situation, especially since you had made a reservation for dinner, and the delay resulted in missing the reservation and incurring a charge. However, it's essential to consider the overall dynamics and communication in this situation.  \nLeaving a social gathering or event without communicating your intentions can be seen as rude and inconsiderate. In this case, while the delay was frustrating, it might have been more appropriate to address the issue with your friends and explore alternative solutions instead of abruptly leaving.  \nYour friends likely felt disappointed and inconvenienced by your departure, and they may see your actions as inconsiderate. It's important to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings and concerns in situations like this, rather than taking drastic actions like leaving without explanation.  \nYou may want to consider reaching out to your friend and his girlfriend to discuss the situation, explain your perspective, and express your frustrations, which can help mend the situation and possibly avoid any lingering resentment. While you might not be entirely in the wrong, addressing the issue constructively can help maintain your relationships.", "Dump them as friends and then go to small claims court for getting the money back for missing the reservation, that his time consuming girlfriend and cousin were taking so long about, cuz HOLY GEEZ THAT'S RIDICULOUS \ud83e\udd26", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Fifteen minutes maybe but even 730 would be pushing it.", "NTA", "NTA. They were extremely disrespectful", "I wonder if the cousin was even there.  This couple gives me \u201cmatchmaker\u201d vibes.  Since they\u2019re a couple, they want all their friends to be couples.  They finally got OP to cave, but never got the cousin to go along with it and spent that hour trying to strong arm them to join the date.", "This should be the top post. Send them a link to this post so they see they are all idiots.  Your friend clearly always gets used like this and expects to be disrespected. NTA", "Yep, send that Venmo request.", "> I won't even be friends with people that are late all the time. Let alone date them.\n\nYes, that's the thing. regardless of whether OP is TA or not (IMHO, NTA) an _early_ should  not date a _late_, they're just not compatible and will just irritate each other constantly with their different attitudes towards punctuality. \n\nTherefor, this date was not going to work out. Therefor, OP lost nothing by bailing out when this basic incompatibility was revealed. Red flag, bullet dodged etc.\n\nMaybe it's just \"friend's girlfriend\" and not the cousin who's the _late_. But the cousin \"knew the schedule\" too. If the cousin isn't a _late_ then she can contact OP and apologise for her behaviour. But I doubt that's how it is.", "Exactly! I have certainly stopped seeing friends for that reason.", "Agreed, I hate when people are late to everything. A first date is when you're supposed to be putting your best face forward. If someone is late to a first date (without a very good excuse) I just assume they run late all the time and am not interested in getting involved with them.", "I thought they were late because his friend\u2019s girlfriend always cuts it close, not her cousin.", "A first date no less!", "I bet that friend and GF planned on a split bill between friend and OP with friend and GF picking the most expensive dishes in the joint.", "From the OP's text, both of them were late.", ">In this case, while the delay was frustrating, it might have been more appropriate to address the issue with your friends and explore alternative solutions instead of abruptly leaving.\n\nWhy would OP want to do that at that point? It's one thing to be a few minutes late, but they were a full *hour* behind schedule, all while OP was there waiting for them So why would OP want to continue a date with someone who clearly doesn't respect his time? Unless they expressed that an emergency or something came up that caused a delay, why would OP want to wait there for who knows how long, having to come up with new plans on the fly for someone who, again, doesn't respect his time?\n\n>Your friends likely felt disappointed and inconvenienced by your departure,\n\nI'm sure OP was more disappointed that he had to wait an hour and lost $25 on a reservation they all agreed on. \n\n>It's important to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings and concerns in situations like this, rather than taking drastic actions like leaving without explanation.\n\nI'm pretty sure, even if OP didn't tell his friend why he left, they could probably figure out the reason themselves. I would hope at least one of the three has the common sense to realize that it's disrespectful to make someone wait at least an hour, possibly more, for a date with a clear schedule, and that said disrespected person is likely not going to want to continue the date.", "Seems both were late here."]}
