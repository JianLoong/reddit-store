A couple of weeks ago I agreed and a double date was planned for last night. The plan was that my buddy and I was going to pick up his girlfriend and her cousin at 7 and go to dinner. We picked the restaurant and I made a reservation for 8 (it\u2019s 30 mins from her place). Everyone was in on the planning so everyone know the schedule.\n\nWe arrived at her place at 6:45 and they\u2019re not ready. We were early so it\u2019s not a big deal. My buddy and I sit and talk until 7:15. He jokingly reminds his girlfriend we have a reservation then comments to me that she always cut things close. At 7:30, I\u2019m getting a little annoyed that we\u2019re cutting it so close. They come out at 7:45 to say they\u2019re almost done then go into her bedroom. 8 rolls around and at this point I\u2019m in a bad mood since it\u2019s an hour pass when we were supposed to leave. About 10 mins later, I get up to leave and my buddy tries to talk me out of it. At this point I was livid for having to wait over an hour and missing the reservation. Since I made the reservation, they charged me $25 for missing the reservation. \n\nThis morning my buddy and his GF texted and called me to tell me what a jerk I was for leaving our planned double date. I defended myself but they argued we could have gone somewhere else and that I ruined the night for everyone. They want me to apologize but I steadfastly refused. Now I\u2019m not only an ass but according to them, a stubborn jerk.", "created_utc": 1697996397, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dyq9c/aita_for_leaving_a_double_date_before_it_started/", "score": 884, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
