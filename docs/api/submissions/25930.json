I  (28F) have been living with my mom the last few years because she convinced me that it would be great for me save money on rent and eventually buy a house. The reality of that ended up being that she wanted me to be a live in babysitter when she didn\u2019t feel like dealing with my now 15 year old special needs brother. My brother is very low functioning, he isnt toilet trained and communicates in few words. (Few sentences too) My mom has always been lazy with his care. She stopped taking him to school and his therapies for speech, life skills etc around the time of the pandemic. She slowly stopped taking him years before this, and would never follow through will making sure he kept up with what he was supposed to be learning. Even the therapists would tell her to spend more time teaching him how to do certain things to help set him up for a bit more independence but my mom just gives up when things get hard and assumes he wont be able to do them. She\u2019s a stay at home mom, and all she does is watch tv and play games on her phone all day and make excuses. Lately..Shes been booking vacations with my stepdad and leaving him with me without  advanced notice and not even considering the fact that I would have to take off from work to watch him without any compensation from her. She feels as though I don\u2019t pay rent (I have student  loans and tons of other bills) that I don\u2019t need to get paid to watch him. Watching him is a job in itself. He cant do anything for himself so I have to basically be a CNA, a nanny etc. My long distance boyfriend of 4 years  found me my dream job  offer close to where he lives and set everything up so that I can move there asap. My mom is furious and says that its a a bad idea if I leave and went on a rant about me \u201cfollowing after a man\u201d. (Which is funny because shes done the same thing multiple times). Anyway we got into a heated argument and I pointed out that the only reason she doesn\u2019t want me to leave is because I provide her with free childcare. At first she swore that wasn\u2019t it but then told me that I\u2019m being selfish by leaving and that taking care of my brother is an all hands on deck situation. I forgot to mention that my stepdad (his father) also lives with her but works a 9-5 an hour away.  He works from home 2 days out of the week and gets home around 6 the other days. And my oldest brother who works from home (38m) lives 10 mins away so she\u2019s not alone she just rather me do the heavy lifting. After telling her that I\u2019m making the decision to take this job and move forward with my life shes being absolutely horrible towards me and acting as if I betrayed my family. I told her that even though I\u2019m happy to help out sometimes, he is not my child and I cant put my life on hold to watch him when you decide to you don\u2019t feel like dealing with him. AITA?\n\n**EDIT. Wow thank you for responses but I want to clear up somethings. First, while she is lazy she isn\u2019t neglectful. She does make sure he\u2019s fed, after he goes to the bathroom and is cleaned up after etc. my issue is when she feel like she deserves a break it gets pushed on me without asking if I\u2019m up to it. Its like \u201chere it\u2019s your turn, I\u2019m tired. And if you complain your a terrible ungrateful child etc etc\u201d. So yes I agree that there is a lot of emotional manipulation that I didn\u2019t speak up on earlier which allowed her to continue this behavior and entitlement, I 100% accept my responsibility it not creating better boundaries, but to be clear he is not being neglected shes just a lazy mother. She does the work but complains the entire time and feels like its our burden to share. Its as if she see\u2019s me as the 3rd parent Which explains her reaction to me moving. I do feel guilty about leaving (I now know that I shouldn\u2019t) but that needed to be said towards the call cps comments", "created_utc": 1693488612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166b8hm/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_my_special_needs/", "score": 439, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm so sorry your mom is putting you through this.  I'm sure you know that she is probably overwhelmed by the whole situation. NEVERTHELESS, that is NOT an EXCUSE for her to abandon the responsibility of caring for HER disabled child and foisting that care off on anyone, especially her own adult child.  \n\nHas she checked into assistance from the state or federal government for disabled people?  She may be eligible for some types of assistance that would help her to care for him and take some of the pressure off of her.  Caring for someone 24/7 is hard work, especially one as severely disabled as your brother, but she is doing HERSELF and HIM a HUGE DISSERVICE by not sticking with the programs set by the therapists.  If she had stuck with it, she'd not be in nearly the mess she finds herself in as training has to continue until it's embedded, or else it's lost quicker than it's gained, then you have to start at square one all over again.  \n\nI'm sure it's probably frustrating for your brother too, because he probably recognizes there are things he COULD be doing if only someone would help him learn until it's second nature for him to perform.  He may be nonverbal and very limited in his abilities, but that doesn't mean he cannot comprehend more than it appears.  Sometimes the mind functions at a higher ability than the body, and that mind is trapped within a body that doesn't respond correctly.  To me, that is just horrifying, being able to think, but not communicate that one can comprehend more than what one can physically perform.\n\nYou need to LIVE YOUR LIFE.  You cannot live your mother's life, nor your brother's life FOR THEM.  That is something they have to do themself.\n\nIt may be time to call family or child protection services and get them involved...a lot of times reporting that kind of thing can remain anonymous, and some places won't even ask your identity, just the information of the child who is at risk or in danger.\n\nGood luck and GO LIVE YOUR LIFE, you deserve it.  It's hard, but your mom isn't going to stop taking ADVANTAGE OF YOU unless YOU STOP IT.  In this case, that means moving away.  Yes, she will try to guilt trip you, but it is NOT YOUR CHILD?  You had NO CHOICE in her decision to have a baby 15 years ago, and you are not responsible for his serious disability.", "NTA! Everything you told your mom was absolutely correct. It's not your responsibility, she is the one that's selfish and you should go and live your life happily and guilt free.

If your mom can't take care of him herself, if your dad and older brother can't help then he needs appropriate care. You can't help. You have a job, you have your own commitments and more importantly you have your own life.\n\nIf they want you to be your brother's carer they will have to pay you for it.

She says it's an all hands situation. What she means is its your situation. \n\nIn reaction to the edit. You would have been fully justified calling CPS. She abandoned her child multiple times.

So I don't say that lightly. This actually is neglect. You wouldn't be wrong to call CPS, even given your clarification edit. Your brother is absolutely being neglected, and even with you living there, you haven't been able to properly help him because your mother refuses the things he actually needs.

I'd be shocked if her treatment of him isn't also indicative of neglect towards yourself, as well. You need a professional to help you navigate all of this before the cycle repeats itself because you've internalized your mom's behavior and actually have to ask if extricating yourself from this abuse makes you a bad person. You're not. She is. Her husband is. Everyone who had the chance to do something to help this poor kid and didn't is. NTA NTA NTA", "NTA. But your mother definitely is.

His disability requires a higher degree of support and specialization of supports for him to get the education he NEEDS and is being denied.\n\nGetting him back into school will help access the multiple support services he needs and deserves. He is not just a burden your parents can decide how to endure. He is a unique person whose life and light are being imprisoned and undermined by his parents neglect. It's disgusting and disgraceful that your parents think he can't learn and grow in maturity and independence, so why bother? As long as he's fed, clean and not tearing down the house, it's all good- and as good as it's ever going to get. Those are expectations for a pet, not a person.\n\nOP, sacrificing your life to his care is not a solution. But your parents are abusing your brother by denying him the educational programs, opportunities and support he has the right and need to receive.

What about in home type care so she could have a break?  If she is there while a caregiver gives her a break, she can't possibly object to that.  Then again, some people will accept their lot in life, do nothing but complain about it and NEVER do the stuff they KNOW they must do in order to CHANGE shit.  They are perpetual victims and there is nothing you can do to change them.  I really hope this is not the case, but if it is, then you cannot let yourself get caught up in the mess that is created by her own LACK of acting in her own best interest.  You cannot allow yourself to SUFFER simply because she made a choice and refuses to act.  \n\nI had to go no contact with my mom because she was an alcoholic and even though she drove drunk and disabled herself by plowing into the back of a big beer truck (ironic, I know) crushing her feet, she played the poor me game at the care home EVERY.

When she passed away, I hadn't spoken to her in over 12 years and I didn't feel guilty because she had made her own choices long ago and I knew that I'd never have a healthy or normal relationship with her because she was mentally and emotionally sick and abusive.  \n\nSometimes you have no choice but to do the best thing for yourself.  Sometimes that means cutting out people whose behavior is toxic to your own well being.  There is NO SHAME in that.  It's hard, but truly, once you get some distance your mind and heart gets MUCH MORE CLEAR and you can see just how unhealthy it truly is.\n\nI'm really sorry.", "NTA, however OP she's been severely neglectful by not helping your brother the things he can learn for a bit more I dependance.

Good luck!", "I think I can talk for all the professional of the mental health care branch: NTA.\nThe first time I started to work as a caretaker in a mental hospital, there was this patient with an extremely low IQ who had been in the care of her mother for two decades. When she was brought to our facility she couldn't bear to wear clothes, she would suddenly crouch in the middle of the corridors instead of going to the toilet (she didn't even know what the toilet was for), she couldn't use a knife or fork or couldn't even sit at the table to eat at all. Of course she was nonverbal and wouldn't react to anything we would try to tell her or explain to her.\nHer mother who couldn't take care of her anymore because she was aging and in bad shape, had come to surrender her.\n\nIt took I think at least 2 years for a group of nurses, doctors and educators to get her to learn the minimum. To go to the toilet, to get dressed, to get undressed, to wash her body, to eat at the table and use a fork or a spoon etc . Really the bare minimum, but it is all the difference between amateur care and professional care.\n\nThere was a full team of professionals trying to find the best ways to efficiently get the young woman to learn things that she should have learned at least 10 years ago. It didn't only work, a lot of the behavioral problems the young women had disappeared when she learned to execute simple tasks that were related to her daily comfort. Her stress levels literally dropped and she was so much more eager to listen to us, pay more attention to the people who were trying to help her.\n I can remember how attached she was to some members of the nursing staff, she would follow them and try to please them. The smile I could see sometimes appear on her face, I heard that it was something she had learned from one of her favorite nurses. It was her way to communicate with her too.\n\nSo OP I think that you don't need to torture yourself about something that was unjustly forced on you and that was just going to burden you until you can't take it anymore.\nIt's hard for us, it can only be harder for you. And when we, professionals, burn out... I just don't want to imagine what happens with kind and empathetic people like you, who didn't even ask for it but just did their best.\n\nYou sacrificed enough for your brother already. Don't don't let your mother make you think that you have any sort of responsibility towards him. Time to live your life and let her find solutions that I think, are really obvious.\n\nIf she can't do it alone and can't force part of the responsibility and burden on someone else in the family, she will have to ask for professional help, which is in your brother's best interest, really.\n\nGood luck.", "*Dominick Toretto has left the chat*", "I'm sorry, but your mum is neglecting your brother. So she makes sure he has food, and cleans him up when necessary... How long has it been since went to school, or had the therapy he needs??...That's neglect.
