{"id": 25930, "submission_id": "166b8hm", "title": "AITA for telling my mom that my special needs brother is not my responsibility? *long post warning", "selftext": "Backstory. I  (28F) have been living with my mom the last few years because she convinced me that it would be great for me save money on rent and eventually buy a house. The reality of that ended up being that she wanted me to be a live in babysitter when she didn\u2019t feel like dealing with my now 15 year old special needs brother. My brother is very low functioning, he isnt toilet trained and communicates in few words. (Few sentences too) My mom has always been lazy with his care. She stopped taking him to school and his therapies for speech, life skills etc around the time of the pandemic. She slowly stopped taking him years before this, and would never follow through will making sure he kept up with what he was supposed to be learning. Even the therapists would tell her to spend more time teaching him how to do certain things to help set him up for a bit more independence but my mom just gives up when things get hard and assumes he wont be able to do them. She\u2019s a stay at home mom, and all she does is watch tv and play games on her phone all day and make excuses. Lately..Shes been booking vacations with my stepdad and leaving him with me without  advanced notice and not even considering the fact that I would have to take off from work to watch him without any compensation from her. She feels as though I don\u2019t pay rent (I have student  loans and tons of other bills) that I don\u2019t need to get paid to watch him. Watching him is a job in itself. He cant do anything for himself so I have to basically be a CNA, a nanny etc. My long distance boyfriend of 4 years  found me my dream job  offer close to where he lives and set everything up so that I can move there asap. My mom is furious and says that its a a bad idea if I leave and went on a rant about me \u201cfollowing after a man\u201d. (Which is funny because shes done the same thing multiple times). Anyway we got into a heated argument and I pointed out that the only reason she doesn\u2019t want me to leave is because I provide her with free childcare. At first she swore that wasn\u2019t it but then told me that I\u2019m being selfish by leaving and that taking care of my brother is an all hands on deck situation. I forgot to mention that my stepdad (his father) also lives with her but works a 9-5 an hour away.  He works from home 2 days out of the week and gets home around 6 the other days. And my oldest brother who works from home (38m) lives 10 mins away so she\u2019s not alone she just rather me do the heavy lifting. After telling her that I\u2019m making the decision to take this job and move forward with my life shes being absolutely horrible towards me and acting as if I betrayed my family. I told her that even though I\u2019m happy to help out sometimes, he is not my child and I cant put my life on hold to watch him when you decide to you don\u2019t feel like dealing with him. AITA?\n\n**EDIT. Wow thank you for responses but I want to clear up somethings. First, while she is lazy she isn\u2019t neglectful. She does make sure he\u2019s fed, after he goes to the bathroom and is cleaned up after etc. my issue is when she feel like she deserves a break it gets pushed on me without asking if I\u2019m up to it. Its like \u201chere it\u2019s your turn, I\u2019m tired. And if you complain your a terrible ungrateful child etc etc\u201d. So yes I agree that there is a lot of emotional manipulation that I didn\u2019t speak up on earlier which allowed her to continue this behavior and entitlement, I 100% accept my responsibility it not creating better boundaries, but to be clear he is not being neglected shes just a lazy mother. She does the work but complains the entire time and feels like its our burden to share. Its as if she see\u2019s me as the 3rd parent Which explains her reaction to me moving. I do feel guilty about leaving (I now know that I shouldn\u2019t) but that needed to be said towards the call cps comments", "created_utc": 1693488612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166b8hm/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_my_special_needs/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm so sorry your mom is putting you through this.  I'm sure you know that she is probably overwhelmed by the whole situation. NEVERTHELESS, that is NOT an EXCUSE for her to abandon the responsibility of caring for HER disabled child and foisting that care off on anyone, especially her own adult child.  \n\nHas she checked into assistance from the state or federal government for disabled people?  She may be eligible for some types of assistance that would help her to care for him and take some of the pressure off of her.  Caring for someone 24/7 is hard work, especially one as severely disabled as your brother, but she is doing HERSELF and HIM a HUGE DISSERVICE by not sticking with the programs set by the therapists.  If she had stuck with it, she'd not be in nearly the mess she finds herself in as training has to continue until it's embedded, or else it's lost quicker than it's gained, then you have to start at square one all over again.  \n\nI'm sure it's probably frustrating for your brother too, because he probably recognizes there are things he COULD be doing if only someone would help him learn until it's second nature for him to perform.  He may be nonverbal and very limited in his abilities, but that doesn't mean he cannot comprehend more than it appears.  Sometimes the mind functions at a higher ability than the body, and that mind is trapped within a body that doesn't respond correctly.  To me, that is just horrifying, being able to think, but not communicate that one can comprehend more than what one can physically perform.\n\nYou need to LIVE YOUR LIFE.  You cannot live your mother's life, nor your brother's life FOR THEM.  That is something they have to do themself.\n\nIt may be time to call family or child protection services and get them involved...a lot of times reporting that kind of thing can remain anonymous, and some places won't even ask your identity, just the information of the child who is at risk or in danger.\n\nGood luck and GO LIVE YOUR LIFE, you deserve it.  It's hard, but your mom isn't going to stop taking ADVANTAGE OF YOU unless YOU STOP IT.  In this case, that means moving away.  Yes, she will try to guilt trip you, but it is NOT YOUR CHILD?  You had NO CHOICE in her decision to have a baby 15 years ago, and you are not responsible for his serious disability.", "NTA! Everything you told your mom was absolutely correct. It's not your responsibility, she is the one that's selfish and you should go and live your life happily and guilt free. She should be very grateful that you have done as much as you have up to this point but instead, she wants you to put your life on hold so she and your stepdad and cavort and go on trips while you do all the heavy lifting indeed. NTA!", "NTA. Your life is your own. You don't owe her anything. You should speak to your stepdad and brother about the things you've noticed, what your mom has said and how it's probably best for your younger brother in the long run to sign up for full time care.\n\nYou are not his mother, you are not a slave or indentured servant and you are not his carer. If your mom can't take care of him herself, if your dad and older brother can't help then he needs appropriate care. You can't help. You have a job, you have your own commitments and more importantly you have your own life.\n\nIf they want you to be your brother's carer they will have to pay you for it. They cant just keep dumping the job of looking after him on you with no notice or pay next time you will be going for work if they leave him with you without your express agreement beforehand (in writing in multiple places with payment agreed for missed work) or you will be calling police non emergency for child abandonment.", "NTA  \n\n\nits NOT your responsability to be a 2nd parent that is the job of the parents who chose to have the child (biolgical or step)   you did not sign up for this you are 100% in the right for trying to live your own life", "NTA. This woman is abusive and neglectful. She is gaslighting you, manipulating you, and just generally lying to you about everything. \n\nThrough her neglect, she created a situation she did not want to deal with. Yes, what she did to sibling is textbook neglect. Her solution was to lie to you to get you in place to deal with that situation. Now she is doubling down on the manipulation using every abusers favorite tool - guilt. \n\nLeave. You deserve to live your life, not try to untangle the mess she created. She says it's an all hands situation. What she means is its your situation. \n\nIn reaction to the edit. You would have been fully justified calling CPS. She abandoned her child multiple times. It doesn't matter that you picked up the slack. Her leaving without arranging proper child-care is abandonment.", "nta and I am reading your edit. she sounds neglectful not just lazy", "At 28, you should leave, I get you are helping.  Now is the perfect time, get out, build your life. NTA"]}
