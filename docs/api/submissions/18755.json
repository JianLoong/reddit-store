Sure yours is more money BUT if you split yours and split it so each of you got the same amount you'd end up with less because they also have money in a trust that they will be keeping for themselves. \n\nTell you parents your siblings are the greedy ones for wanting their trusts and your trust fund. \n\nLet them go no contact. It's a petty reason.\n\nEdit. This is also a form of emotional abuse. Do as I say or I won't speak to you or love you ever again.  Your parents lack emotional maturity.\n\nIt was left to you. Not you and any other future grandchildren ( siblings)", "Don't give in.. you're young so you may not see where this is heading as your siblings get older. It's going to be constant guilt trips etc on their part. Especially if you end up being more successful than them.\n\nAnd your parents threatening to cut off contact is manipulative and emotional abuse. Ask them if they were raised to treat their kids like that ?\n\nKeep your money NTA.", "NTA\n\nThere's a big difference between your trust fund and your siblings that you don't mention... You (probably) have access to your trust fund right now (or soon) and since your siblings are minors, they probably don't have access to their trust fund yet.  \n\nSo, any money you give them from your current funds is money your parents don't have to pay to support your (minor) siblings.  This means your parents have a strong incentive to pursuade you to \"share\" your money.\n\nAlso, dependent minors can't make legal contracts.  So your siblings can't make a legal agreement with you to share their trust funds.  And by the nature of trust funds, your parents can't agree to share your siblings' funds with you.\n\nIn other words, any money you give anyone from your trust fund would almost certainly not be repaid ever.\n\nAdditionally, your parents may be trying to tell you that your fund is worth a lot more than your siblings' and that's why you should share.  However, you shouldn't compare the value of your fund at age 22 to the value of their fund at 17 because your fund has had 5 more years of compound investment growth.  At an annual growth rate of 8%, your siblings'funds could be worth 47% more when they're 22 than when they're 17.  So, if right now, they have about 70% of what you have, those amounts could potentially be equal at the same ages.  \n\nLastly, a trust fund is specifically intended to transfer the money (or other asset) directly to the beneficiary for good reasons.  The fact that both your great grandfather and your other grandparents set up trusts to benefit you and your siblings, and bypassed your parents, could indicate that your older family members don't trust your parents to be good decision makers with money.  If your parents aren't great with money, don't listen to their \"advice\".", "NTA. Do NOT acquiesce on this. That money was left to you. You have a plan to use it wisely. No one gets to bully you into sharing it\u2026and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. They are emotionally manipulating you. Stand firm. Stay the course. Your financial future depends on this.\n\nETA: if you wanna play petty: next time they threaten to go no contact, reply \u201cWell , good thing I can afford my own place.\u201d", "NTA. You met the requirements and they have their own trust funds.", "NTA. Everyone's a communist when the other person has more.", "NTA.  The money was left to you specifically.  You aren\u2019t obligated to share it.  Personally, I think threats and cussing people out rarely works in softening hearts.  But that\u2019s their choice to with that strategy.   The fact that your parents and sisters are eager to embrace this strategy tells me a lot about them.", "NTA. No one is entitled to someone else\u2019s money. You have a trust. They have a trust. If your great grandfather intended you to share your trust with any future siblings of yours, he could have stated that directly.", "Nta, and I think your parents are just tired of hearing your siblings cry about it.  Call your dad's parents, if they set up a fund for the twins maybe they'll be willing to change the terms of the trust to include you, or maybe they'll tell the twins either they leave you alone or you get their funds too", "NTA, especially because you had to meet requirements to access the money.\n\nI know this is probably just me, but I\u2019d go NC with anyone who thinks you should share.", "NTA Its only an argument if you take part in it. The trust is yours and you earned it. Your grandfather would be disappointed if you wasted it by giving it away. Stop arguing and discussing it. Don't give into emotional blackmail.", "Nta. It sounds like the sisters got a trust from grandparents that you did NOT get a trust from? So you have one from grandpa A, they have one from grandpa B, there are no others? That makes it seem kinda like theirs was to make up for yours to begin with\u2026.\nDo NOT give in. My guess is, if you don\u2019t know the amounts, yours is worth significantly more and sisters want some. Or parents borrowed from sisters, if there were no stipulations\u2026.", "NTA It's not like your sisters get nothing. They're getting their own trust fund.\n\nMust be nice to be in a position to argue about _trust funds_. You should remind your family of this, and spend your money how you see fit. It's yours.", "NTA they never even knew their grandpa, they are the ones being greedy.", "NTA- they have their own trust fund .\n\nBut just mad that you get yours first .\n\nYou\u2019re good.", "NTA. They got theirs and you\u2019ve got yours. End of discussion. \n\nYour sisters have manipulated your parents into going along with them. It\u2019s wrong. The other grandparents set up their trust, so the beef is with the grandparents, not you, over them having to split that. \n\nYour money is yours. If you give in, it will never stop.", "NTA, pay off your student loan first.  Then take a fun trip.  Good chance your parents will not cut you off but if they do it will show how petty they are. Sorry but this is not rec league t-ball where everyone gets a trophy.", "INFO: Is one of the grandparents you mention your great grandfather's child?\n\nIf not, I assume if your great grandfather set upped a trust fund then he had somewhat good money, who inherited that money?", "NTA - The Gparent who gifted you a trust could have worded it to be shared with all offspring from said marriage. That did not occur. Congratulations on graduation. Life is not fair nor balanced. Live into honoring the gift you were given is a fine focus.  The Twins should focus on creating their success story instead of pining for your money.", "NTA. Your grandfather might have left your sisters their own trust funds if he hadn't passed away before they were born. It's also possible your other grandparents would have created a trust fund for you if they didn't know you had one and your sisters didn't. Your parents (or at least your father) probably also inherited from your grandfather, and of course they can decide what to do with their own estate. \n\nThose are a lot of might haves and probables, and all you have to go on is what actually exists.  You're not obligated to share if you don't want to, and nobody else has to share with you. I think your parents are not being very loving by threatening to cut off contact if you don't share. (My father left everything to his second wife because he thought I'd already received all I deserved to have. He didn't cut off contact while he was alive though.)", "NTA. Don\u2019t give in. They have a trust. Your great grandfather gave you the gift of being able to go no or low contact. Take it and run. Make your own family. Don\u2019t let people put you down like this even if they are \u201cblood\u201d.", "NTA. Yours is worth more at the moment, but it's also been growing another five years. \n\nWhen the twins are 22, the size of their trust fund may have nearly doubled if the markets have another good bull run. Also, unless they are prodigies they haven't graduated from college yet, they haven't met the criteria you had to meet, and even if they did, if you're not in charge of the trust it's a moot point.\n\nOnce you settle down and find employment, if you're in a position to help with some of your younger siblings' education expenses it would be a reasonable thing to do particularly if their trust fund isn't enough to cover them.\n\nOne other thing: remember to find out whether your money from your trust fund is taxed as income, and set aside enough to pay those taxes.", "NTA\n\nAs soon as your parents threatened to cut ties, if I was you my first response would have been \"Well, bye\".\n\nThey have their own money, they are not entitled to yours.", "Your trust fund, not theirs. You can't help if your g'grandfather passed before they were born. They have a trust fund from the other grandparents. Do what you need to do. NTA", "NTA. In this case maybe money is more important than family. Your family isn't being nice", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve proceeded with your life knowing you had this reward to help you. Shouldn\u2019t this have been talked about long before you became 18 and had life plans? If it was structured for you to get a degree then there would be no money to split if you didn\u2019t go to college. Without the money you might\u2019ve made very different decisions. I\u2019m sorry your parents are weighing in against you. I\u2019d 100% call them out that you based your trajectory on this gift, that you earned that gift through your hard work, and again, had there been a discrepancy once your sisters were born they should\u2019ve started the framework of splitting inheritance from that moment on, not spring it on you after you\u2019ve \u201cspent\u201d the money.", "NTA. And your parents are truly awful. The twins have their own fund. Equal is not always fair. They were not born. But they still have one. Never let anyone force you or make you feel guilty for what was given to you.", "NTA. Your sisters and your parents see this as an easy money grab. You all have trusts and that's a huge blessing. They can do whatever they want with their money and so can you. If anyone is greedy it's your family.", "They \u201cdidn\u2019t raise you to be greedy\u201d\u2026\nThen who raised your sisters? Sounds like a double standard.", "Info: how much more money are you getting compared to each of your sisters? \n\nYou said the stipulation was graduating college? Would you not have gone to college if the trust fund hadn\u2019t required it? \n\nDo you think your grandfather would have wanted it split equally? Or if he had lived longer that he would have included them? \n\nYou said he died way before your sisters were born, but you\u2019re only 5 years older than them. So he died when you were a baby/toddler? \n\nSo none of the three of you really had a meaningful relationship with him. \n\nHonestly for me I think it really does come down to how big of a difference in money it is. Bc it\u2019s not like you had a special bond with him. If he had lived longer it would have presumably have been equally split. \n\nLike if your sisters are getting 10k each and you\u2019re getting 90k? Yeah I\u2019d feel like it was unfair. (That being said, you would still have every right to keeping all of it)\n\nBut also if you selected a pricer college than you would have if the trust fund hadn\u2019t existed, splitting the trust fund now could put you in a bad financial situation, so I could see that being a complicating factor.", "So, do you think your great-grandfather would have left your sisters an equal share if they had been born before he died?  Is the trust fund they have a lot less than yours? \n\nIt sounds like the only reason you have the only trust fund from him is because you happened to be born first.   And the only reason you've fulfilled the obligation of graduating college is because you're old enough to have done so.  \n\nI understand that you have plans for the money.  You just need to decide if it's worth losing a relationship with your parents and sisters. \n\n NAH because they're not being unreasonable and you don't legally have any obligation to share.  I don't see why the trust funds from him and the other fund aren't split equally between the three of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s your money and you don\u2019t have to share if you don\u2019t want to, but depending on the answers to these questions, they could be entirely justified to be upset with you if you don\u2019t.\n\nIt might be worth finding out exactly how much is in you sisters\u2019 accounts, and if it\u2019s less (per person) than what you have received, then you could set up smaller separate accounts for them to make it even out. Using the example in the preceding comment, if they each currently have $10K and you have $90K then you can set up an account for each of them with $20K (or whichever amount would even the math out with interest by the time they\u2019re 22 years old). But you should put the same stipulations on it that you had on your trust: can only receive the money if/when they graduate college. That would make things even across the board. \n\nAgain, you\u2019re under no obligation to do this, but you should consider if you\u2019re really okay with the potential consequences if you don\u2019t.

If the OP splits their trust now, there\u2019s nothing stopping the sisters from refusing to share theirs when the time comes."]}
