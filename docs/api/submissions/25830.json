I own my home as I purchased it this February and it is my second home. I made a good amount on my first home and put most of that money towards this house. I have a good career making about 80K and my mortgage is $1500. \n\nMy boyfriend rents a room from his friend who owns a townhouse. His friend travels a lot for work and is hardly ever home. Maybe 1 week out of the month or so. My boyfriend pays $800 a month, which includes utilities. It's a nice place and my boyfriend makes good money as well, probably around 60-70k. \n\nSo recently, his friend was thinking about selling his townhouse and just moving in with his girlfriend. He told my boyfriend this, who then came over one night and sort of sprung all of it on me and told me that he should move in with me. I was really shocked as we have only been dating for five months and I really don't think that is long enough time for me to think about letting him move in. I tried talking about it with him and told him I needed some time to think it over. He was visibly annoyed, but let it go. \n\nSo yesterday, I got a text from him stating that his friend plans to list his townhouse in Oct and my boyfriend needs to be out by the end of Oct. My boyfriend doesn't have a lease or anything, but he texted me and said he needs to move in with me short term as that's not enough time to find an apartment. I texted him back and said we could talk that night. When he came over last night, he was ranting/begging me to let him move in. About how he didn't make enough money to get an apartment, and that it would just be less stressful for him to move in with me. That if he could help pay half than it would be good for me too, etc, etc.  I shut down that idea and told him we have not been together long enough for me to want to take that step. He got upset and called me heartless, and then left. \n\nHe texted me today and apologized, but still asked that I think about it a few more days. I told my friend and coworker today about everything, and he said that I'm an asshole for not letting him move in. I was really shocked, but my coworker kept going, saying that in this economy people can't afford to live by themselves and that five months is long enough to move in together. I didn't say anything, but just remained quiet. \n\nSo AITA for telling my boyfriend that he can't move in with me?

Do not let him push you around. His behavior about this is a series of red flags. You earn more and are a responsible homeowner.

He can likely find someone with a place looking for a roommate. Let him do that and then observe how he navigates being a new roommate.  If he\u2019s smart, and is interested in a LTR w/you, he\u2019ll respect your position, live elsewhere, save money, and down the line you can decide together if you have a future together.", "NTA sounds like they want to move in for convenience rather than actually taking that next step together", "NTA. His pressuring you when you\u2019re obviously reluctant is very concerning behavior. It\u2019s high stakes for you to let someone move in. A bad decision could have a huge impact on your mental health, peace of mind, financial and even physical health. Once he gets in it will probably be quite difficult to get him out.

He shouldn't have to move in with you just because of economic issues.

It's not like you have an obligation to provide housing for him. He's basically just whining because he wants to save money.\n\nPlus, he makes enough money to be able to buy the townhouse from his roommate, I would guess. But that would mean taking out a loan and having the responsibility.\n\nBut even if he can't, he can certainly find a place to live with another roommate. People are looking for roommates to rent rooms from all the time, which is what he's doing right now anyway. So what's the big deal?\n\nAgain, you're not his mother. He's a 32 year old grown man and he should be able to take care of himself without whining and begging for you to give him a place to live as though he would be destitute and on the street otherwise, which would certainly not be the case.\n\nHe can easily find another place to live, and there are residency motels he could stay in in the meantime if he can't find anything soon enough.

Sure it's not the prettiest, biggest apartment, but enough for one person. My boyfriend and I we're dating for 10 months now and I don't feel ready to live with him yet. You're NTA. \n\nIt's important that you make it clear to him that you don't want to live with him at the moment. Maybe you can help him looking for an apartment.

I just need time to find my own place, I've already started looking. I'll be out of your way in a month tops, and I'll help out with chores and groceries\" then... maybe. \n\nBut it sounds like he was demanding, not asking, and then he pressured you repeatedly.

Your reservations are how you feel and that's ok.  It doesn't make you a bad person, and its good to communicate them to him so that he can set his own expectations about your future together, and maybe move on if you don't think he is the one.", "NTA, do NOT let him force you into doing this.

He seems entitled like he expects you to provide him financial assistance when you've hardly been dating long at all. \n\nYou are perfectly right to be hesitant and not want him to move in. If he's saying he can't find a place before October, then you'd end up stuck with him for ages if you let him move in and ended up wanting to split up. He would drag his heals trying to move out. \n\nIf you earn more than him, and own the house, I would also speak to a solicitor before you decide to let him move in, even in future, or anyone else should you end up with someone else, to make sure your property is safe guarded should you end up living with someone. \nI think as long as they only contribute towards utilities, entertainment and groceries, its not classed as contributing towards the house, but if he were to pay towards the mortgage, he could try staking a claim on it should you split up later down the line. So before you move anyone in at any time, speak to a solicitor to protect yourself and know the best way to do things, and where you would stand on making them leave should you split up etc. \n\nBut in this instance, I'd definitely say no to letting him move in. You're not responsible for him, it's only been 5 months, and his attitude seems very entitled to me and he's only moving in for his convenience, not because you've reached a point where you want to live together because you feel ready to take that step. It's all about him and how he can't afford a place and so basically wants you to provide it for him. \n\nHe seems to have had a good deal with his landlord being away most of the time so he has essentially been living in a townhouse for the cost of renting a room, and only has to see his friend one week a month. Now he's got to find somewhere else it will cost him more, but that's the same for everyone. \n\nHim trying to pressure you and guilt you and then becoming angry and rude is a red flag to me. Definitely don't let him move in. He needs to get his arse in gear and start looking for his own place. I wouldn't be surprised if it came time to move out and he's conveniently not found anywhere to live yet, and will try to force you into letting him stay. Do not fall for that either. If he has parents or or other family near by he can go stay with them, or even friends. Don't let him force and manipulate you into it.", "NTA \n\nTo me, it sounds like he has some financial issues, especially stating that he can't afford his own place.  Which is a whole different can of worms that you want no part of.", "NTA  5 months is nothing.", "NTA. If he put half as much effort into finding an apartment as he is begging you to take him in, he would find a place to live.\n\nHe sounds like he is trying to mooch rather than be a grown man on his own. Tell him to get a year lease somewhere and you guys can talk about different living arrangements when that lease is ending.", "NTA. The length of time is somewhat immaterial, it only matters if you feel comfortable with it and you don\u2019t.

It may be different where I live, but 2 months should be enough time to find a rental. \n\nI\u2019ve known so many people to rush into it and then it hasn\u2019t worked out. An example - I had been with my boyfriend (now husband) for three years when my best friend moved in with her boyfriend of a year. She was asking me whether I was worried that we hadn\u2019t committed to each other and taken the leap. I started to worry my boyfriend wasn\u2019t serious about me. A year later, she\u2019d broken up with her boyfriend and had a house to sell. I had moved in with mine and was engaged.

You don\u2019t move in with someone just because they need to look for a new place. It should be a discussion you both agree on. He\u2019s not accepting no for an answer. He\u2019s trying to guilt you. You say he makes decent money but suddenly he can\u2019t afford his own apartment? Weird.

Even if he\u2019s not clear on his motivation, he needs to be clear on the length -  is it short-term or permanent? And, if it\u2019s only intended to be short-term, how does he expect to keep it short term when he\u2019s this convinced that finding affordable housing isn\u2019t possible?\n\nSecond, his lack of ability to work through problems reasonably is showing he\u2019s not a good choice for either a romantic relationship or a flatmate.

It's only been five months. It's far to soon and the circumstances around his request doesn't create a positive vibe in your relationship. I think he needs to chill on the tantrum for not getting his way. I don't fault him for being nervous or scared of the unknown but his reaction to you is off putting. You didn't work hard in your 20s to make his 30s easier. He needs to face the world; support him emotionally, if he's lost offer him guidance.

Why expect you to rescue him?\n\nSomeone lacking this kind of independence and self sufficiency at his age is a red flag  for me. Is the real issue his bad credit rating or spending beyond his means?\n\nHe also hasn't proven yet whether or not he'll pull his weight with upkeep or other expenditures. \n\nHard pass. This kind of move is very premature. You don't really know him yet.", "NTA. You said he makes good money. Does he make as much money as he said he does? I am just wondering this because now he is acting like he can't afford an apartment. Your coworker is pissing me off because yes the economy sucks but if he makes good money maybe he is being a bit dramatic cause he really just wants to use this an excuse to push moving in early or something and he really could afford an apartment.

You have different positions on this topic and living together is a major topic. Consider this though....he will need to sign a lease. Probably for 1 year.

That can impact vacations and other things, which are important times for bonding.\n\nI genuinely understand your position.

The fact that he feels entitled to move in, despite you explaining you're not ready and be pushy about it is a HUGE red flag. It's YOUR home. You decide who gets to live in it.

That was 14,5 years ago.\n\nThe advantage of moving in together early on is that you start off your joint chores with a bit more respect for the other and get to know each other quite well quite quickly.\n\nHowever if it doesn\u2019t feel right it\u2019s not right. No matter how long you\u2019ve been dating.", "I met my husband online, married him 3 months later and we moved in together. November will be 4 years for us.", "Pretty similiar here too. My now wife moved in with me after around 3 months. That was 12 years ago. \n\nTime is irrelevant in these sorts of things. If OP is not comfortable having their partner move in, then why would they let them?\n\nThe bigger issue I see is their partner trying to pressure them into doing something they don't want to. \n\nI wonder how much time they have actually spent together if the partner spends most of their time travelling. What's the longest amount of time either have stayed over at the others for?", "I've found that you generally can't even look for a place unless you're willing to move in within a month or two. Landlords don't like to leave a place empty. He could also just look for a short term room to rent or bedsit type place if he doesn't find what he's looking for. \n\nPushing that hard to move in seems so rude to me. Asking is fine but being weird about it would make me reconsider the relationship. At 5 months I'd be wary about letting a partner even just stay for a month or two while looking, let alone properly move in. I would if they were genuinely struggling but this guy seems to be making fine money. Maybe he's just bad with money and doesn't have enough for deposit etc.", "Or doesn't want it...", "Wage difference really might not mean anything. Depending on where you live could make the total being paid be considerable more.  Given he was paying 800 and could only rent a room, I suspect he may be living in a big City. I pay 800 and have a house, but if I tried to get some where for that in lets say London, I'd probably end up getting a room only and potential only big enough for a single bed.", "No. There are states where \"common-law\" marriages are not recognized at all, true. But in states where they are recognized, it's not determined by the amount of time; it's determined by the nature of the relationship, and the amount of financial dependence one person has on the other.", "I\u2019ve been in a quasi-homelessness situation, and in a different country! \n\n100% on my own, with not enough deposit \u20ac for a proper place (i had to urgently move out of the place I had just moved in 3 months before + was earning shit), i can definitely agree that it is more than scary. \n\nBut OPs \u201cboyfriend\u201d earns well & is in his own country, with friends and family most likely able to give a hand, if not jump in in case of emergency. He should also have some savings considering the $ he makes and low rent he\u2019s been paying. \nHe\u2019s clearly breaking her boundaries & thinking of himself only. The only difference living with OP would make in contrast with getting his own place would be preferential treatment, and that\u2019s what he seems to be after.", "Not taking No for an answer is a red flag. Wanting to move in after 5 months is sniffed red flag.", "I paid $850 for 13 square meter studio before getting a place with my SO. Prices arent low here either.", "He wants to move in because it's the best deal, not because he is ready or wants to. \n\nI agree it's over but only because he turned into a hobosexual (relationship for housing)."]}
