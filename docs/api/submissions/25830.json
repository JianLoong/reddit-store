I own my home as I purchased it this February and it is my second home. I made a good amount on my first home and put most of that money towards this house. I have a good career making about 80K and my mortgage is $1500. \n\nMy boyfriend rents a room from his friend who owns a townhouse. His friend travels a lot for work and is hardly ever home. Maybe 1 week out of the month or so. My boyfriend pays $800 a month, which includes utilities. It's a nice place and my boyfriend makes good money as well, probably around 60-70k. \n\nSo recently, his friend was thinking about selling his townhouse and just moving in with his girlfriend. He told my boyfriend this, who then came over one night and sort of sprung all of it on me and told me that he should move in with me. I was really shocked as we have only been dating for five months and I really don't think that is long enough time for me to think about letting him move in. I tried talking about it with him and told him I needed some time to think it over. He was visibly annoyed, but let it go. \n\nSo yesterday, I got a text from him stating that his friend plans to list his townhouse in Oct and my boyfriend needs to be out by the end of Oct. My boyfriend doesn't have a lease or anything, but he texted me and said he needs to move in with me short term as that's not enough time to find an apartment. I texted him back and said we could talk that night. When he came over last night, he was ranting/begging me to let him move in. About how he didn't make enough money to get an apartment, and that it would just be less stressful for him to move in with me. That if he could help pay half than it would be good for me too, etc, etc.  I shut down that idea and told him we have not been together long enough for me to want to take that step. He got upset and called me heartless, and then left. \n\nHe texted me today and apologized, but still asked that I think about it a few more days. I told my friend and coworker today about everything, and he said that I'm an asshole for not letting him move in. I was really shocked, but my coworker kept going, saying that in this economy people can't afford to live by themselves and that five months is long enough to move in together. I didn't say anything, but just remained quiet. \n\nSo AITA for telling my boyfriend that he can't move in with me?

Do not let him push you around. His behavior about this is a series of red flags. You earn more and are a responsible homeowner. You\u2019re still in the vetting stage of the relationship, and he should still be courting you. He also has 2 months to find a place, which should be enough time. He can likely find someone with a place looking for a roommate. Let him do that and then observe how he navigates being a new roommate.  If he\u2019s smart, and is interested in a LTR w/you, he\u2019ll respect your position, live elsewhere, save money, and down the line you can decide together if you have a future together.", "NTA sounds like they want to move in for convenience rather than actually taking that next step together", "NTA. His pressuring you when you\u2019re obviously reluctant is very concerning behavior. It\u2019s high stakes for you to let someone move in. A bad decision could have a huge impact on your mental health, peace of mind, financial and even physical health. Once he gets in it will probably be quite difficult to get him out. His being so overbearing here makes me suspect that he wants to take advantage of you.

He shouldn't have to move in with you just because of economic issues. Plus, if he can't afford to support himself, then what does that say about the long-term prospects for your relationship with him? \n\nYou're not his mother. It's not like you have an obligation to provide housing for him. He's basically just whining because he wants to save money.\n\nPlus, he makes enough money to be able to buy the townhouse from his roommate, I would guess. But that would mean taking out a loan and having the responsibility.\n\nBut even if he can't, he can certainly find a place to live with another roommate. People are looking for roommates to rent rooms from all the time, which is what he's doing right now anyway. So what's the big deal?\n\nAgain, you're not his mother. He's a 32 year old grown man and he should be able to take care of himself without whining and begging for you to give him a place to live as though he would be destitute and on the street otherwise, which would certainly not be the case.\n\nHe can easily find another place to live, and there are residency motels he could stay in in the meantime if he can't find anything soon enough.

Sure it's not the prettiest, biggest apartment, but enough for one person. My boyfriend and I we're dating for 10 months now and I don't feel ready to live with him yet. You're NTA. \n\nIt's important that you make it clear to him that you don't want to live with him at the moment. Maybe you can help him looking for an apartment.

I just need time to find my own place, I've already started looking. I'll be out of your way in a month tops, and I'll help out with chores and groceries\" then... maybe. \n\nBut it sounds like he was demanding, not asking, and then he pressured you repeatedly.

Your reservations are how you feel and that's ok.  It doesn't make you a bad person, and its good to communicate them to him so that he can set his own expectations about your future together, and maybe move on if you don't think he is the one.", "NTA, do NOT let him force you into doing this.

He seems entitled like he expects you to provide him financial assistance when you've hardly been dating long at all. \n\nYou are perfectly right to be hesitant and not want him to move in. If he's saying he can't find a place before October, then you'd end up stuck with him for ages if you let him move in and ended up wanting to split up. He would drag his heals trying to move out. \n\nIf you earn more than him, and own the house, I would also speak to a solicitor before you decide to let him move in, even in future, or anyone else should you end up with someone else, to make sure your property is safe guarded should you end up living with someone. \nI think as long as they only contribute towards utilities, entertainment and groceries, its not classed as contributing towards the house, but if he were to pay towards the mortgage, he could try staking a claim on it should you split up later down the line. So before you move anyone in at any time, speak to a solicitor to protect yourself and know the best way to do things, and where you would stand on making them leave should you split up etc. \n\nBut in this instance, I'd definitely say no to letting him move in. You're not responsible for him, it's only been 5 months, and his attitude seems very entitled to me and he's only moving in for his convenience, not because you've reached a point where you want to live together because you feel ready to take that step. It's all about him and how he can't afford a place and so basically wants you to provide it for him. \n\nHe seems to have had a good deal with his landlord being away most of the time so he has essentially been living in a townhouse for the cost of renting a room, and only has to see his friend one week a month. Now he's got to find somewhere else it will cost him more, but that's the same for everyone. \n\nHim trying to pressure you and guilt you and then becoming angry and rude is a red flag to me. Definitely don't let him move in. He needs to get his arse in gear and start looking for his own place. I wouldn't be surprised if it came time to move out and he's conveniently not found anywhere to live yet, and will try to force you into letting him stay. Do not fall for that either. If he has parents or or other family near by he can go stay with them, or even friends. Don't let him force and manipulate you into it.", "NTA \n\nTo me, it sounds like he has some financial issues, especially stating that he can't afford his own place.  Which is a whole different can of worms that you want no part of.", "NTA  5 months is nothing.", "NTA. If he put half as much effort into finding an apartment as he is begging you to take him in, he would find a place to live.\n\nHe sounds like he is trying to mooch rather than be a grown man on his own. Tell him to get a year lease somewhere and you guys can talk about different living arrangements when that lease is ending.", "NTA. The length of time is somewhat immaterial, it only matters if you feel comfortable with it and you don\u2019t.

It may be different where I live, but 2 months should be enough time to find a rental. \n\nI\u2019ve known so many people to rush into it and then it hasn\u2019t worked out. An example - I had been with my boyfriend (now husband) for three years when my best friend moved in with her boyfriend of a year. She was asking me whether I was worried that we hadn\u2019t committed to each other and taken the leap. I started to worry my boyfriend wasn\u2019t serious about me. A year later, she\u2019d broken up with her boyfriend and had a house to sell. I had moved in with mine and was engaged.

You don\u2019t move in with someone just because they need to look for a new place. It should be a discussion you both agree on. He\u2019s not accepting no for an answer. He\u2019s trying to guilt you. You say he makes decent money but suddenly he can\u2019t afford his own apartment? Weird.

Even if he\u2019s not clear on his motivation, he needs to be clear on the length -  is it short-term or permanent? And, if it\u2019s only intended to be short-term, how does he expect to keep it short term when he\u2019s this convinced that finding affordable housing isn\u2019t possible?\n\nSecond, his lack of ability to work through problems reasonably is showing he\u2019s not a good choice for either a romantic relationship or a flatmate.

It's only been five months. It's far to soon and the circumstances around his request doesn't create a positive vibe in your relationship. I think he needs to chill on the tantrum for not getting his way. I don't fault him for being nervous or scared of the unknown but his reaction to you is off putting. You didn't work hard in your 20s to make his 30s easier. He needs to face the world; support him emotionally, if he's lost offer him guidance.

Why expect you to rescue him?\n\nSomeone lacking this kind of independence and self sufficiency at his age is a red flag  for me. Is the real issue his bad credit rating or spending beyond his means?\n\nHe also hasn't proven yet whether or not he'll pull his weight with upkeep or other expenditures. \n\nHard pass. This kind of move is very premature. You don't really know him yet.", "NTA. You said he makes good money. Does he make as much money as he said he does? I am just wondering this because now he is acting like he can't afford an apartment. Your coworker is pissing me off because yes the economy sucks but if he makes good money maybe he is being a bit dramatic cause he really just wants to use this an excuse to push moving in early or something and he really could afford an apartment.

You have different positions on this topic and living together is a major topic. Consider this though....he will need to sign a lease. Probably for 1 year.

That can impact vacations and other things, which are important times for bonding.\n\nI genuinely understand your position.

The fact that he feels entitled to move in, despite you explaining you're not ready and be pushy about it is a HUGE red flag. It's YOUR home. You decide who gets to live in it.

If it\u2019s done respectfully, it\u2019s not a constant and indefinite dragging of heels, or someone being overly pushing like this guy, and it\u2019s discussed fully and any feelings thrown up are aired out too it doesn\u2019t have to be the end of a relationship at all.\n\nIf he had gone \u2018so I\u2019m going to have to move out of my house, I would quite like to move in with you, plus it would be financially sensible for both of us, how would you feel about that?\u2019 \n\nAnd she had gone \u2018sorry I\u2019m just not ready yet. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t hope to get to that point with you one day but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been together for long enough for me to feel ready for that yet. How about you get another lease for a year and we review our timelines then? I know it sucks that you\u2019ll probably have to move in to a houseshare and it\u2019s not the answer you wanted from me, and moving is always really stressful. But I\u2019ll help you look for places or even come on viewings if you like so you won\u2019t be alone with the stress of it?\u2019. \n\nA reasonable person might reply with \u2018yeah ok, I understand this is too quick for you. Obviously I\u2019m a bit disappointed/hurt and feel like I put myself out there and got rejected. And I\u2019m so stressed about having to move in with strangers. But I completely respect that you\u2019re not ready and I was probably thinking more about my own convenience than the practical realities\u2019.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry you feel so stressed, moving is the absolute worst and you really liked where you lived and your housemate so it\u2019s just really crap. I understand why you feel hurt and disappointed but I want to reassure you that I\u2019m not rejecting you, I\u2019m just moving at a slightly different pace. I promise I still love you and hope we will live together one day when we\u2019re making the decision not because of an external pressure has slightly forced their hand, but because we both feel truly ready. Is there anything else I can do to make you feel supported through this? Would you like a sad cupcake too?\u2019\n\n\u2026.that\u2019s how a pair of reasonable people could discuss the idea of moving in together when one is not in the same page as the other. There would be no reason to breakup after a conversation like that and I think it\u2019s incredibly common for one person to feel ready before the other. And a lot of the times it doesn\u2019t come up in such a pressured way but he\u2019s just looking at this from a point of stress and \u2018what would be the easiest solution here\u2019.\n\nNow whether this particular relationship should be over is another question. Mayyyyybe he is just coming at it from a highly strung angle of how can I solve this stressful problem, and not really thinking about it all clearly. But he\u2019s being incredibly pushy and entitled here and if that\u2019s his general way of treating OP she should get out. At the very least this is one red flag to take note of. \n\nIt should be pretty obvious that my judgement is NTA. Aside from his pushiness it\u2019s also just really fast by most people\u2019s standards. 5 months was about the point that me and my now wife went on holiday together and said I love you for the first time. It\u2019s also about the time that I found myself with nowhere to live and the idea of moving it with her never even came up - 5 months is still so early on!", "You're acting like living out of your car wouldn't completely turn your life upside down.

What makes him the asshole is not accepting that she isn't ready.  My girlfriend of nearly 3 years and I were talking about moving in together.  I thought it was a great idea because I am moving to the same town as her and it would save us about 14k each per year.  She told me she was having second thoughts (her family is super traditional), and I said that is fine I can always get my own place.  I think it is financially irresponsible, but it is what it is.", "I was planning on being there. The idea was that I would live at my place when visiting, I do extended visits, and then we would date normally like two people who had just started dating- which was the case. But it ended up that he wanted to see me every day and set up an office space for me at his place that was way better than the one at my place. So I'd end up just staying at his place all the time. I got rid of my place there recently, which was a massive waste of money. In the end I think he needed to just not be rushed into *having* to have me live with him.

She told me to go back and tell my landlords I needed to stay and it\u2019s ok to not be ready. They were an old couple and probably would have let me.

If he aims to spend 40% on rent, he needs a place that is \\~$1480/month. \n\nIn most of the US, that would give him a good sized 1-2 bedroom.

Just because you are dating someone that you do not live with does not mean you get to move in just because your current living situation is changing.  And again he has two months.

What if he is a total slob or treats her like crap?  What if they move in together and it simply doesn't click.   Do you know how hard it is to evict someone if this doesn't work out and he doesn't want to leave?  Also if he is throwing such a fit now what is to say he won't become abusive?  Then he may become physical or just emotional abusive. \n\nNow as far as breaking up, I have no idea.  But to say she doesn't want the same thing after only 5 months is not fair.
