I own my home as I purchased it this February and it is my second home. I made a good amount on my first home and put most of that money towards this house. I have a good career making about 80K and my mortgage is $1500. \n\nMy boyfriend rents a room from his friend who owns a townhouse. His friend travels a lot for work and is hardly ever home. Maybe 1 week out of the month or so. My boyfriend pays $800 a month, which includes utilities. It's a nice place and my boyfriend makes good money as well, probably around 60-70k. \n\nSo recently, his friend was thinking about selling his townhouse and just moving in with his girlfriend. He told my boyfriend this, who then came over one night and sort of sprung all of it on me and told me that he should move in with me. I was really shocked as we have only been dating for five months and I really don't think that is long enough time for me to think about letting him move in. I tried talking about it with him and told him I needed some time to think it over. He was visibly annoyed, but let it go. \n\nSo yesterday, I got a text from him stating that his friend plans to list his townhouse in Oct and my boyfriend needs to be out by the end of Oct. My boyfriend doesn't have a lease or anything, but he texted me and said he needs to move in with me short term as that's not enough time to find an apartment. I texted him back and said we could talk that night. When he came over last night, he was ranting/begging me to let him move in. About how he didn't make enough money to get an apartment, and that it would just be less stressful for him to move in with me. That if he could help pay half than it would be good for me too, etc, etc.  I shut down that idea and told him we have not been together long enough for me to want to take that step. He got upset and called me heartless, and then left. \n\nHe texted me today and apologized, but still asked that I think about it a few more days. I told my friend and coworker today about everything, and he said that I'm an asshole for not letting him move in. I was really shocked, but my coworker kept going, saying that in this economy people can't afford to live by themselves and that five months is long enough to move in together. I didn't say anything, but just remained quiet. \n\nSo AITA for telling my boyfriend that he can't move in with me?

Do not let him push you around. His behavior about this is a series of red flags. You earn more and are a responsible homeowner. You\u2019re still in the vetting stage of the relationship, and he should still be courting you. He also has 2 months to find a place, which should be enough time. He can likely find someone with a place looking for a roommate. Let him do that and then observe how he navigates being a new roommate.  If he\u2019s smart, and is interested in a LTR w/you, he\u2019ll respect your position, live elsewhere, save money, and down the line you can decide together if you have a future together.", "NTA sounds like they want to move in for convenience rather than actually taking that next step together", "NTA. His pressuring you when you\u2019re obviously reluctant is very concerning behavior. It\u2019s high stakes for you to let someone move in. A bad decision could have a huge impact on your mental health, peace of mind, financial and even physical health. Once he gets in it will probably be quite difficult to get him out. His being so overbearing here makes me suspect that he wants to take advantage of you.

He shouldn't have to move in with you just because of economic issues. Plus, if he can't afford to support himself, then what does that say about the long-term prospects for your relationship with him? \n\nYou're not his mother. It's not like you have an obligation to provide housing for him. He's basically just whining because he wants to save money.\n\nPlus, he makes enough money to be able to buy the townhouse from his roommate, I would guess. But that would mean taking out a loan and having the responsibility.\n\nBut even if he can't, he can certainly find a place to live with another roommate. People are looking for roommates to rent rooms from all the time, which is what he's doing right now anyway. So what's the big deal?\n\nAgain, you're not his mother. He's a 32 year old grown man and he should be able to take care of himself without whining and begging for you to give him a place to live as though he would be destitute and on the street otherwise, which would certainly not be the case.\n\nHe can easily find another place to live, and there are residency motels he could stay in in the meantime if he can't find anything soon enough.

Listen, 5 months is enough time for some people to move in together and not enough for others. Your boyfriend is ready and interested. You are not. That's fine.

Make it clear he\u2019s paying rent and on a month to month basis (because you will need an out if you ever break up and month to month makes it easier to get him out faster) spell out exactly what they pay and what\u2019s required of them.

He seems entitled like he expects you to provide him financial assistance when you've hardly been dating long at all. \n\nYou are perfectly right to be hesitant and not want him to move in. If he's saying he can't find a place before October, then you'd end up stuck with him for ages if you let him move in and ended up wanting to split up. He would drag his heals trying to move out. \n\nIf you earn more than him, and own the house, I would also speak to a solicitor before you decide to let him move in, even in future, or anyone else should you end up with someone else, to make sure your property is safe guarded should you end up living with someone. \nI think as long as they only contribute towards utilities, entertainment and groceries, its not classed as contributing towards the house, but if he were to pay towards the mortgage, he could try staking a claim on it should you split up later down the line. So before you move anyone in at any time, speak to a solicitor to protect yourself and know the best way to do things, and where you would stand on making them leave should you split up etc. \n\nBut in this instance, I'd definitely say no to letting him move in. You're not responsible for him, it's only been 5 months, and his attitude seems very entitled to me and he's only moving in for his convenience, not because you've reached a point where you want to live together because you feel ready to take that step.

Now he's got to find somewhere else it will cost him more, but that's the same for everyone. \n\nHim trying to pressure you and guilt you and then becoming angry and rude is a red flag to me. Definitely don't let him move in. He needs to get his arse in gear and start looking for his own place. I wouldn't be surprised if it came time to move out and he's conveniently not found anywhere to live yet, and will try to force you into letting him stay. Do not fall for that either.

I think he needs to chill on the tantrum for not getting his way. I don't fault him for being nervous or scared of the unknown but his reaction to you is off putting.

Me and my partner moved in together after 3 months. 8 years later we are still together and still living together. It\u2019s been great.\n\nThis worked for us. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll work for everyone else.\n\nEverybody\u2019s relationships move at different speeds and if OP doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s been enough time then that\u2019s all that matters.", "I moved in with my now husband after 8 months but was kind of terrified at the time. I got rid of all my furniture and stuff so if I'd had to start again it would be expensive. I had a great deal on my rent and wasn't going to get that again. He told me if it didn't work out he'd support me to move somewhere with furniture and stuff but still was very scary. Turned out that he genuinely is the best person I've ever met and we've now been together nearly 13 years, but I absolutely understand OP's concern. If she's not ready he shouldn't be pushing it on her. Absolutely NTA.", "This. \nAlso, while two months is short time,  it is definitely possible.", "While or course different as I'm in a different county, I earn 1/2 of this dude's salary and have never had a single issue getting an apartment in time when moving. Not once. I also have pets shortening the list of available apartments for rent by quite a lot. If he cant find a new place to live within 2-3 months he is absolutely useless.", "If its over because of this, it wouldnt have lasted anyways, and therefore not worth it", "Usually when one person wants to move in and the other isn\u2019t ready, it\u2019s over.", "Or when one side becomes homeless, there.ms a domino effect."]}
