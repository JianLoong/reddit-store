I own my home as I purchased it this February and it is my second home. I made a good amount on my first home and put most of that money towards this house. I have a good career making about 80K and my mortgage is $1500. \n\nMy boyfriend rents a room from his friend who owns a townhouse. His friend travels a lot for work and is hardly ever home. Maybe 1 week out of the month or so. My boyfriend pays $800 a month, which includes utilities. It's a nice place and my boyfriend makes good money as well, probably around 60-70k. \n\nSo recently, his friend was thinking about selling his townhouse and just moving in with his girlfriend. He told my boyfriend this, who then came over one night and sort of sprung all of it on me and told me that he should move in with me. I was really shocked as we have only been dating for five months and I really don't think that is long enough time for me to think about letting him move in. I tried talking about it with him and told him I needed some time to think it over. He was visibly annoyed, but let it go. \n\nSo yesterday, I got a text from him stating that his friend plans to list his townhouse in Oct and my boyfriend needs to be out by the end of Oct. My boyfriend doesn't have a lease or anything, but he texted me and said he needs to move in with me short term as that's not enough time to find an apartment. I texted him back and said we could talk that night. When he came over last night, he was ranting/begging me to let him move in. About how he didn't make enough money to get an apartment, and that it would just be less stressful for him to move in with me. That if he could help pay half than it would be good for me too, etc, etc.  I shut down that idea and told him we have not been together long enough for me to want to take that step. He got upset and called me heartless, and then left. \n\nHe texted me today and apologized, but still asked that I think about it a few more days. I told my friend and coworker today about everything, and he said that I'm an asshole for not letting him move in. I was really shocked, but my coworker kept going, saying that in this economy people can't afford to live by themselves and that five months is long enough to move in together. I didn't say anything, but just remained quiet. \n\nSo AITA for telling my boyfriend that he can't move in with me?

If things go south how do you get him out?  Will he have a rental agreement?  Then you have to follow tenant law.  If not, and he receives mail at your house, then it's a whole different issue.   His pushy nature and not respecting your clear boundry is concerning, too.  He can find a room for rent on Craigslist, he's just looking for an easy way out.  Hold your ground.", "NTA is he 32 or 12?  He\u2019s throwing a tantrum. Let him, but decide how you feel about that.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to give him a place to live. He's in his 30s throwing a tantrum. He can fuck off. If you're not comfortable with it, you don't have to", "NTA, Don't listen to your co-worker (and don't take relationship advice from them again). You're not obligated to take in your boyfriend. And his ranting, annoyed response speaks volumes about his character - like he can't take \"no\" for an answer.\n\nAlso, if you let him in for the 'short term', he's not going to leave.", "NTA. Do not let him push you around. His behavior about this is a series of red flags. You earn more and are a responsible homeowner. You\u2019re still in the vetting stage of the relationship, and he should still be courting you. He also has 2 months to find a place, which should be enough time. He can likely find someone with a place looking for a roommate. Let him do that and then observe how he navigates being a new roommate.  If he\u2019s smart, and is interested in a LTR w/you, he\u2019ll respect your position, live elsewhere, save money, and down the line you can decide together if you have a future together.", "NTA sounds like they want to move in for convenience rather than actually taking that next step together", "NTA. His pressuring you when you\u2019re obviously reluctant is very concerning behavior. It\u2019s high stakes for you to let someone move in. A bad decision could have a huge impact on your mental health, peace of mind, financial and even physical health. Once he gets in it will probably be quite difficult to get him out. His being so overbearing here makes me suspect that he wants to take advantage of you. You have absolutely no responsibility to house a grown man, especially one you barely know.", "Good for you for standing your ground! He shouldn't have to move in with you just because of economic issues. Plus, if he can't afford to support himself, then what does that say about the long-term prospects for your relationship with him? \n\nYou're not his mother. It's not like you have an obligation to provide housing for him. He's basically just whining because he wants to save money.\n\nPlus, he makes enough money to be able to buy the townhouse from his roommate, I would guess. But that would mean taking out a loan and having the responsibility.\n\nBut even if he can't, he can certainly find a place to live with another roommate. People are looking for roommates to rent rooms from all the time, which is what he's doing right now anyway. So what's the big deal?\n\nAgain, you're not his mother. He's a 32 year old grown man and he should be able to take care of himself without whining and begging for you to give him a place to live as though he would be destitute and on the street otherwise, which would certainly not be the case.\n\nHe can easily find another place to live, and there are residency motels he could stay in in the meantime if he can't find anything soon enough. What would he do if he wasn't in a relationship with you? Would he just live on the street? No, he would find something.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

If you\u2019re not ready to live with him, you\u2019re not ready to live with him.", "NTA. You aren't ready to move in together, you're not ready. He is an adult and needs to figure out his own housing situation. If he can't afford his own apartment with the amount he's making, he's bad with money as well as being manipulative and demanding.\n\nIt sounds like if you cave to his request, you will regret it for a long time.", "NTA. Tell the boyfriend to move in with the coworker.   You've only known him for 5 months, you have no obligation to him.", "Nta. Be careful. Listen to your gut. He\u2019s a grown man, he can find a place to live or he can offer to buy the townhouse.", "NTA. You know your comfort level and boundaries. If five months is too soon for you, then it's too soon, and your BF needs to respect that.", "NTA\n\nNeither is your boyfriend, but your friend is. Listen, 5 months is enough time for some people to move in together and not enough for others. Your boyfriend is ready and interested. You are not. That's fine. You two had a disagreement that got emotional. That happens in relationships when goals/dreams aren't aligned.\n\nYour friend thinking that it is thier place to harshly judge a perfectly reasonable life decision is not fine.", "NTA -  If you are not comfortable with that, no Ody can or should try to force you to do that. \nWe are still in August and the friend asked to leave in October, so he has all September to find a new place. And what he said to you - Heartless- for not accepting something you are not comfortable todo, believe it. \nOn the other hand, before someone moves in with you, I think you have to talk about some important things: Will you make a lease? Will he be okay with it and willing to pay you rent if you have something on paper? Will you be comfortable with someone that you only have met for 5 months to have full access to your home and stuff? Will he and you share chores? Cleaning? Cooking?  What will happen if one of you want to invite friends or family yo the house? Will you share your room?", "NTA\n\nFive months isn't long enough, you're right.\n\nHe's got 2 months, which is plenty of time.", "NTA\n\nEven without a formal contract, in most states someone becomes a tenant after a certain number of days living with you and has to be evicted by a court. \n\nDo NOT let this guy move in with you.", "Nta. Super red flags. Its been 5 months, girl he's trying to pressure you into this. You will regret it if you do this, so no do not let him move in with you.", "Lady, go with your feelings. You aren't ready for this move, and there must be some good reason for that, possibly the fear that if BF becomes a housemate things will get rough between you.\n\nIt is also especially significant that he started calling you names when you told him no. And that is because...\n\nHe wants what he wants and he doesn't care what you want.\n\nStick to your guns and do not cave...and you will be see just how enraged he can be when he doesn't dominate.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He\u2019s 32 and he wants to force his way into your house by throwing a tantrum?", "You need to upgrade your boyfriend and your friend.  5 months or 5 years, it is up to you to decide when you feel comfortable living with someone.  I know that for me 5 months would be far too early to let someone into my home.  Your boyfriend appears to be using this as a way to rush the relationship, and he is not taking being told \"no\" well.  This is a red flag.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. This guy sounds like a walking red flag. He didn't ask if you could help him temporarily while he gets on his feet, he *told* you he should move in after just 5 months, and then called you heartless when he didn't get his way. It's not as though he's about to become homeless. He has time to find another room to rent. And maybe I'm just being overly cynical, but he sounds like the kind of guy who would get settled in and then decide he shouldn't pay rent unless he's on the deed, and call you heartless for demanding money from your boyfriend.", "No no no no no he will never leave. Do not give an inch on this. NTA.", "NTA.  This doesn\u2019t seem healthy.", "NTA, and his reaction is extremely concerning. You should very well reconsider the entire relationship.

Moving in with someone completely changes the relationship dynamic and that\u2019s a step that should be planned and thought out in advance.  Nobody should take that step if there is any hesitation or doubt.  Your bf\u2019s situation sucks, but he can rent a room somewhere else if he can\u2019t afford his own space.  He was completely out of line for pressuring you and reacting that way.  5 months is nothing.

The amount of time is irrelevant it's all about whether or not you feel ready and comfortable with the move.

You deserve someone who respects your boundaries and doesn't verbally abuse you.", "NTA asking to move in at 5 months isnt necessarily a bad thing(bc his specific situation and yeah economy), but his lack of respect of your boundaries is. how he behaves during this transition will be very telling. calling you heartless for reasonably saying no/lets discuss this more is not a great start", "NTA.
