I own my home as I purchased it this February and it is my second home. I made a good amount on my first home and put most of that money towards this house. I have a good career making about 80K and my mortgage is $1500. \n\nMy boyfriend rents a room from his friend who owns a townhouse. His friend travels a lot for work and is hardly ever home. Maybe 1 week out of the month or so. My boyfriend pays $800 a month, which includes utilities. It's a nice place and my boyfriend makes good money as well, probably around 60-70k. \n\nSo recently, his friend was thinking about selling his townhouse and just moving in with his girlfriend. He told my boyfriend this, who then came over one night and sort of sprung all of it on me and told me that he should move in with me. I was really shocked as we have only been dating for five months and I really don't think that is long enough time for me to think about letting him move in. I tried talking about it with him and told him I needed some time to think it over. He was visibly annoyed, but let it go. \n\nSo yesterday, I got a text from him stating that his friend plans to list his townhouse in Oct and my boyfriend needs to be out by the end of Oct. My boyfriend doesn't have a lease or anything, but he texted me and said he needs to move in with me short term as that's not enough time to find an apartment. I texted him back and said we could talk that night. When he came over last night, he was ranting/begging me to let him move in. About how he didn't make enough money to get an apartment, and that it would just be less stressful for him to move in with me. That if he could help pay half than it would be good for me too, etc, etc.  I shut down that idea and told him we have not been together long enough for me to want to take that step. He got upset and called me heartless, and then left. \n\nHe texted me today and apologized, but still asked that I think about it a few more days. I told my friend and coworker today about everything, and he said that I'm an asshole for not letting him move in. I was really shocked, but my coworker kept going, saying that in this economy people can't afford to live by themselves and that five months is long enough to move in together. I didn't say anything, but just remained quiet. \n\nSo AITA for telling my boyfriend that he can't move in with me?

Do not let him push you around. His behavior about this is a series of red flags. You earn more and are a responsible homeowner. You\u2019re still in the vetting stage of the relationship, and he should still be courting you. He also has 2 months to find a place, which should be enough time. He can likely find someone with a place looking for a roommate. Let him do that and then observe how he navigates being a new roommate.  If he\u2019s smart, and is interested in a LTR w/you, he\u2019ll respect your position, live elsewhere, save money, and down the line you can decide together if you have a future together.", "NTA sounds like they want to move in for convenience rather than actually taking that next step together", "NTA. His pressuring you when you\u2019re obviously reluctant is very concerning behavior. It\u2019s high stakes for you to let someone move in. A bad decision could have a huge impact on your mental health, peace of mind, financial and even physical health. Once he gets in it will probably be quite difficult to get him out. His being so overbearing here makes me suspect that he wants to take advantage of you.

He shouldn't have to move in with you just because of economic issues. Plus, if he can't afford to support himself, then what does that say about the long-term prospects for your relationship with him? \n\nYou're not his mother. It's not like you have an obligation to provide housing for him. He's basically just whining because he wants to save money.\n\nPlus, he makes enough money to be able to buy the townhouse from his roommate, I would guess. But that would mean taking out a loan and having the responsibility.\n\nBut even if he can't, he can certainly find a place to live with another roommate. People are looking for roommates to rent rooms from all the time, which is what he's doing right now anyway. So what's the big deal?\n\nAgain, you're not his mother. He's a 32 year old grown man and he should be able to take care of himself without whining and begging for you to give him a place to live as though he would be destitute and on the street otherwise, which would certainly not be the case.\n\nHe can easily find another place to live, and there are residency motels he could stay in in the meantime if he can't find anything soon enough.

Listen, 5 months is enough time for some people to move in together and not enough for others. Your boyfriend is ready and interested. You are not. That's fine.

Keep an eye out.", "I waited 2 years to move in with my boyfriend.  5 months is definitely not long enough.  NTA.", "NTA. 5 months is too soon, and he's creating an emergency to force your hand rather than respect your No and find another solution. The end of October is plenty of time for him to find a new place. This is pure manipulation and I'm surprised your coworker supports it.", "NTA- and do not let him move in even \u201ctemporarily\u201d cause it won\u2019t be temporary.- honestly I\u2019d dump him if he keeps pressing the issue because obviously he has no issues trying to step on your boundaries since you\u2019ve told him no before and why. - and if at some point in the future (with him or someone else) you change your mind (on your own without anyone bugging you about it) put it in writing make it a renter\u2019s agreement and rent him a specific room and if you have more than one a specific bathroom. Make it clear he\u2019s paying rent and on a month to month basis (because you will need an out if you ever break up and month to month makes it easier to get him out faster) spell out exactly what they pay and what\u2019s required of them. And do not ever add anyone else to the title - cause it wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if you had let him move in that was the next plan I pay $$$ so I should be on the title - which is why a renter\u2019s agreement should be in play-also get a lawyer to look at the agreement before having anyone sign it.", "op=NTA\n\ndon't let him move in--once he's there he gains tenancy and then getting his butt out will be miserable.\n\nHe CAN find something that he can afford-he just is refusing to do so.  \n\n5 months is not enough and this is a HUGE red flag!!!    DON'T do it!!!!!!!!!", "Hell no NTA!\nMy BF moved into my house after we were together 10 1/2 months and were discussing marriage ( we got engaged 2 months later and married the following year)\nIf he suggested moving in rather than me asking him to move in I would have dumped his ass.", "The fact that he makes that amount he can afford his own place. You've only been together five months and he's forcing his hand that's a red flag in itself. He's trying to gaslight you to get in his way. I would rethink that because once he moves and you're gonna have a lot of issues with him.", "NTA. You\u2019ve only been dating him for 5 months, it\u2019s not your responsibility to house him. He\u2019s an adult, he can figure out his housing for himself. His reaction to being told no is a huge red flag. Please stand your ground and die on this hill. It\u2019s your house, your call. Your coworker can go shove it.", "I ended up in a similar situation a few years ago, landlord raised GF's rent and she couldn't afford it. She was staying at a friend's place and it wasn't a great situation for her, ended up staying over at my place pretty frequently and after a couple of months I asked her if she wanted to move in. We had been together for 8 months or so and in retrospect it was too soon. We were together for five years but the last 6 - 8 months were not good for either of us.\n\nMy advice is if you don't think you're ready to let him move in, don't do it. If he tries to pressure you even after you've clearly told him it's not what you want then HTA and you should respond accordingly.", "Why is the end of October not enough time to find an apartment? Sounds like bullshit to me. \n\nSounds like he just wants to use you to make his own life more convenient. If he doesn't respect your apprehension that's on him.\n\nNot the asshole. Don't let him pressure you into this. If he keeps pressing the matter you can consider that one of those red flags that will make you glad you didn't agree to it in the first place.", "NTA\n\nIt's not about the 5 months for me even could have been 5 years - if you aren't ready for such a step then you aren't for whatever reason, that should simply be respected by anyone even if they may find it hurtful and wonder on the why.\n\nHe has enough time to find some apartment, if he was being kicked out within 2 days or something similar then of course help him out by temporary letting him stay at your place if you would be comfortable with that idea of course or he can still find elsewhere to stay temporarily if you are afraid that it's gonna turn out to be permanent (and with how you described him in this case I get the feeling that's how it would end up as)\n\nAlso I don't understand why he took it so hard even that reaction doesn't match his age in my opinion, maybe just a weak moment I would say you know him better but 5 months sounds like you don't know him insanely much. Be careful.", "NTA. I learned a long time ago to listen to the voice in my head. You don't want him to move in.  He will manage.", "The bf\u2019s(?) friend \u201cplans to list the townhouse in October\u201d. That\u2019s long enough to look for studio/1 BR apartments and pay a deposit to confirm something.\n\nThe guy is being too pushy about wanting to move in with you and you are right in feeling something\u2019s off. NTA for your spidey senses kicking in", "NAH. Even though I think 5 months is enough to take that step, I can understand that if you are not comfortable or ready, you shouldn't do it.\n\nOn the other hand, it really sucks that your boyfriend is basically getting evicted. Of course, it's not your fault or your obligation to solve all of his problems, but it is unfortunately and undeniably gonna put a lot of strain in your relationship.", "NTA. \n\nyour coworker, however, is not incorrect. Your boyfriend even with a great career, and perfect credit, wouldn't be able to find an affordable rental in this market. \n\nBefore taxes at 60k annually the max he could afford would be 1500. After taxes, benefits, etc he likely can only afford 1k/month. \n\nWhere I am crappt 2bdrm is 1800/month and requires 2 months security and first months rent at signing. 1bdrms are 1500.\n\nAvailable apartments are on the market for 1-2 days and in that time frame landlords are getting more applications than they want to review. \n\nAnyways- enough lamenting the housing market. No you're NTA. You're not obligated to let anyone move in. \n\n(You could however possibly benefit by having a signed rental agreement and collecting $800/month in rent for 6 months- tell him the rental is agreed with a 6month limit not to be extended and he'd have to move out- but you run the risk of a nasty eviction If he doesn't move out when the rental agreement is finished)", "NTA... don't let him move in.", "NTA. I (31m) moved in to my boyfriend\u2019s (38m) apartment after 2-3 months. Now he just turned 40 and I turn 33 soon and we\u2019re still very happy. There\u2019s no right answer to how long it should take, it\u2019s how you feel about it.", "NTA he should not be asking to move in. If you let him, he might pay one month's rent, then he will attempt to use the relationship to pay less or nothing and then you won't be able to get rid of him. You don't need a roommate and he wouldn't be a good one. \n\nThink about this - would he have asked if he wasn't in this situation? No, he can't think of anything else so he's using the relationship to gaslight and bully you into letting him move in. He doesn't care about you enough to move in, he doesn't know what else to do.", "NTA. \n\nAnd dump his a**. He sounds like an irresponsible prick. And he\u2019s gonna keep pestering you until you cave! \n\nWhat if you regret letting him move into your house? Do you expect him to find an apartment then? How are you gonna get him out of the house? \n\nSo, he\u2019s not gonna \u201chelp\u201d you pay for the house, utilities, etc.?! - You\u2019re doing fine on your own. Say, if he pays half of the bills and you wanna kick him out\u2026 Are you gonna pay him back whatever he\u2019s paid you?", "He ain\u2019t hittin that right \ud83d\ude02 every girl I ever dated never ever wanted me to even leave their house and always requested we move in together in the same time frame. I do suppose it simply depends who you\u2019re dealing with. \n\nShe may take things slow. But a certain guy will make her want it. \n\nim on your side I take things slow and I wouldn\u2019t move in with any of them. And I think that\u2019s why they wanted to. \n\nSo NO YOURE NOT the asshole. Absolutely not, explain that you take things like that serious and your personal space is very valuable to you for you just to give it away so Willy nilly.", "NTA. What everyone else says. He's not even living with you yet and you are having a hard time getting him to find another place. Imagine trying to kick him out.", "NTA you\u2019ve only been together for 5 months. I can\u2019t even believe he had the guts to ask", "NTA, thank goodness you're so level headed when you have so many people around you who are seemingly not. 5 months is definitely not long enough, and after the way he acted I'd be having reservations and making sure that's not how he's gonna react to other situations.", "NTA. Trust your guts. Moving in is a huge step.", "NTA. HELL NAH. I know from experience that moving in fast is a BAD idea. Like it takes at least a year to even really get to know someone. Moving in together is a HUGE step and it\u2019s wild that he expected you to just move him in. 5 months is nothing!! Letting him move in could go horribly horribly wrong. And the way he\u2019s pushing this and seems to think he can guilt and pressure you into letting him move in is looking like a red flag. He should respect your decision. If he doesn\u2019t just drop this and get his own place you should probably drop him. At 32 he\u2019s a full blown adult and definitely should have the capability of managing his own needs.", "NTA. At 32 and with a $70k or more income, there is no reason he can't get his own apartment, even in NYC. Granted, it may not be perfect but he can do it.\n\nAnd good for you to know what you are comfortable with and him moving in is not a good idea if you aren't fully onboard. Stick with that, it sounds like he is way too demanding and needy.", "NTA. You own two homes?!", "Absolutely NTA \n\nThat\u2019s your house! Your home! And your BF if only earning slightly less than you so surely he can afford a place of his own? Even if not he is not your responsibility. And if you don\u2019t want to move in yet that\u2019s okay too!! Five months is not a long time and it\u2019s different for everyone. There\u2019s are some red flags here. \n\nThe biggest one is him going off ranting and calling you heartless to apologising via a text! That\u2019s disgusting behaviour that has the potential to worsen. \n\nStand your ground OP. You don\u2019t owe anyone anything.", "INFO:\n\nYou said 5 months is not enough time for you to consider living together. Did you tell give him a more defined period of time, or is it more dependent on how the relationship develops over time?", "NTA - Him not taking your \u201cNo\u201d for an answer is concerning to me. I understand asking in the first place, but to basically coerce you with begs, emotional manipulation, and tantrums is a huge red flag. \n\nIf he moves in, that\u2019s it he\u2019s in, and if he\u2019s so reluctant to take no for an answer when he\u2019s not even in the home; then it\u2019d probably be a whole other kettle of fish trying to get him to leave if it didn\u2019t work out and you wanted him gone. I\u2019m not sure where you live, but common law marriages start when a couple begins to cohabitate, and if he\u2019s contributing payments toward a mortgage\u2026 I don\u2019t know, it feels like it could potentially end in a huge legal and financial mess. \n\nHe has two whole months to get his affairs in order, that\u2019s plenty time to find short or long term accommodation on his salary.", "NTAAA!!! Depending on where you live he could very much make a case for being common law!! \n\nYou\u2019re obviously not ready for this so don\u2019t do it! \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t get that you\u2019re not ready to move in he\u2019s not the one", "I will be dropping the bf, of he is this insane at this stage of the relationship imagine when you live together.\n\nEdot: NTA", "NTA he is already disrespecting your boundaries and is a walking red flag. He has plenty of time to find a place - and I would put money on, if you say no now, him deliberately being \u201cunable\u201d to find an apartment in time so he \u201chas to\u201d move in with you. Without a tenancy agreement (which I am sure he would say isn\u2019t necessary for a \u201cshort term\u201d stay while he \u201cfinds an apartment\u201d) but a financial interest by paying for part of the mortgage, that\u2019s a whole can of worms.\n\nAlso: you can be with someone for decades and still never live with them. I even know a few married couples who have separate houses and they have the happiest marriages because they have their own space and choose when to spend time with their spouse. So there is NEVER an obligation to move in with someone, and someone disrespecting that five months in is not a good sign.", "IMO, 5 months is not long enough to get to know someone fully and let them move into a home you own. His inability to accept the word \u201cno\u201d and continuing to push you on his moving in with you is concerning.", "Send him listings in his budget that he can rent out.", "NTA if you\u2019re not ready to move in with him then you\u2019re not ready. Period.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what it is, but your BF is keeping something from you. 2 months is plenty of time to find an apartment and his income qualifies him for a $2000/month easy (barring any credit issues) \nDo you even know if the friend scenario is true? That sounds like a really convincing story to pressure someone into letting you move in. \n\nAs far as your co-worker - F him. If he truly fees that way maybe pass on BF info as a possible roommate", "NTA stick to your guns", "NTA.  Do not let him move in.  He will not contribute under the guise of looking for somewhere else and will not move out until you evict him.  Ask him why he doesn\u2019t try to buy the townhome?  Walk away.  Consider yourself lucky.", "Nta. He can afford to rent another room somewhere. He doesn\u2019t get to force himself into your space. Gross.", "Rent your house on a short term lease.  Three or six months maybe?  Then the two of you can find a place to rent and try the situation out.  I am betting that after a while if he is this pushing now, you will find other character traits you don't like.", "NTA. For him to move in, you both have to be ready. Not just him. There's no set amount of time being together. My husband and I moved in after 2 weeks and now have 5 boys and pregnant again. But we BOTH wanted to live together and nothing was one sided or forced. Plus you own your home. \n    I would help him find a nice place for him. There are places all over. He's a single man with no kids. Should be easy enough.", "Info: how is the housing situation where you live and is it possible for your bf to find a new home before the end of October?", "NTA \n\nRegardless of it being 5 months or 5 years - **IF YOU DO NOT FEEL 100% COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA THEN KEEP YOUR FOOT DOWN** \n\nHe's already throwing a tantrum because you said no to a big question (that by the sounds of it had not been discussed prior), and that isn't your problem. \nIt's August, if he has until the end of October to find a place that gives him a little under 8 weeks. Although it'll be tight, if he starts looking and applying now he shouldn't have too much of an issue finding a place --- there's even online apps/groups that are specifically for finding a place looking for an extra house mate. \n\nHe's an adult, if he needs someone to hold his hand to help him through life I sincerely suggest not to give him yours.", "Granted it's the end of August, and maybe finding a rental in the US is vastly different than in Canada, but two-ish months should be enough time to find a short term rental for November 1st.", "Agreed, once you let him into your home, he will never leave. You will have to formally evict him while still living with him. I would also start to question whether you want to be with him in the long term, you seem to have different values.", "I had to find a new apartment in 2 months because my landlord waited til the last minute to say he wasn't renewing  my lease.  I live in a small town and there was plenty of places to choose from.", "I think the boyfriend actually is.  Instead of being respectful of her decision, he threw a fit.  Like a child.  Had he said he understood and didn't push it then he would not have been, but he is trying to manipulate her into moving in together.  Agreed, big red flag.", "All situational but don't agree with ops bf. I moved into my partners house when we started dating. Like the day of. I've been together for 2 going on 3 years. Getting other property together, too. I know other couples who do the same thing. All married. But def does not work for everyone.", "Yeah NAH but relationship is probably over"]}
