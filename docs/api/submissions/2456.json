I'm not going after people with ADHD. I am aware that people with ADHD can function and plan things. The sister in this story did not go off meds because she managed it well, it's because she is breast feeding. She has a kid, kids? OP clarified that the sister is organizing because she's probably going to be driving the moving van. \n\nWhy is an unmedicated person with ADHD having to plan someone else's move? That's pretty much asking for this to happen. NTA for you though. I'm mildly amused you're almost trying to argue that you are the Asshole in the comments. You're really not.", "NTA. Let\u2019s hope she is done with breastfeeding soon cause it seems she should be on her medication again\u2026. at least do therapy.", "NTA but - it's not clear to me that you have set clear boundaries snd communicated them to her. You want to do this not in reaction to a specific instance of her changing plans, but at another time. Sit her down snd explain what she can expect from you going forward. For example, it might be that if you've made other plans you won't change them; you are not available for calls between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., etc. So you don't tell her what she can and can't do, just what you will do.", "NTA but you could have said you were going to bed", "You\u2019re allowed to ignore annoying people.", "Nta you know what the kids need even more than breast milk? A stable mom.  She needs to switch to formula and go back on meds bc it's affecting her and her family's lives.", "NTA dn go NC with her as soon as you can.", "I have adhd and this sound stressful even ti me\nNTA", "NTA. Your sister is just being an AH. She know she has a problem and isn't even trying. And being inconsiderate . I'd do more avoiding until she gets herself in check. Starting drama and being bossy is not a side effect of adhd", "NTA and I would tell her that she's TA for steamrolling everybody in the family all the time for whatever suits her. She doesn't have a lock on being right, or what is best for everybody all the time and she needs to back off and give everybody space.", "It\u2019s true I was sleeping, but I also knew she was calling and messaging and turned on dnd so I guess that\u2019s the part I call ignoring and going to sleep instead", "You\u2019re right it wasn\u2019t an emergency, but I guess she wanted me to confirm times that are ok with me before booking a van for the move. And apparently it had to be done then. Those time rules are good. She actually called me a bit before 8 so it wasn\u2019t crazy early, but because I\u2019d had a rough night I wanted to sleep in til noon. Like I said I can be a night owl. So I was off radar til then. But around 8 I had told her I would show up and then went dark. \n\nI could have told her I wanted sleep then and that I\u2019d had a eough night, but it would have just resulted in her asking questions and telling me sleeping in is bad.", "Well actually she is still breastfeeding her newest baby. But I think even after she is finished, she will be unlikely to want to take them due to how they make her feel", "I\u2019m not arguing that I\u2019m TA, I\u2019m just giving more context and details of her feelings and my own. But yeah she is organizing it, because my mom doesn\u2019t have a car and neither do I. Me or mom don\u2019t have licences either. Also she likes to take charge and control things she is involved in so that\u2019s why I guess. My mom is also doing the move inorder to be closer to her so she can help out with the kids so I guess my sister wants to help her back", "I\u2019ve not done that, you\u2019re right. The reason is really stupid too. The reason is that it makes me uncomfortable and I want to avoid the inevitable drama of it. My mom has tried, but it causes my sisted to fly off the handle with her. My sister can get really agressively angry very fast and mom gets the worst of it.", "Yes I agree. I didn\u2019t, because I knew she would question it and tell me it\u2019s bad to sleep in like she has before and I just wanted to avoid that. I was too tired to deal with it.", "I agree fully, but she either doesn\u2019t think she is unstable or doesn\u2019t want to face it", "Are you not allowed to sleep just in case she must get ahold of you? Odds are all you missed was her changing the plans over and over.", "She has ADHD so of course she needed to fix it right away. It\u2019s not really her fault, but it\u2019s not yours either. She needs help. ADHD with kids just brings more chaos so she should talk to a professional.", "Any chance that she could switch to baby formula?   Probably not, but it's definitely an alternate solution.  At the very least she needs to be encouraged to see a therapist.   Medications are evolving and side effects are declining in general.   You are not required to readjust your life for her benefit.", "Yeah you\u2019re right about that!", "Agreed. She doesn\u2019t want to do that for whatever reason even though she used to be in therapy", "Yes I agree with you. My sister gets pretty irritated if anyone comments on meds or therapy. I guess she thinks she doesn\u2019t need them or that they aren\u2019t of help or something. She doesn\u2019t see herself as being that big of a problem", "Last I heard you cannot take stimulant medication with breast feeding. I understand things are tough for you, but unmedicated adhd and a newborn sounds like a nightmare", "NTA. Set some boundaries with your time. She is treating you like her personal slave and that isn't fair.", "OMG stop responding to her promptly/taking her calls. Don't babysit for her or go to her house. She needs to get back to managing her own damn self and maybe then you can do her favors or whatever. NTA.", "NTA & maybe time to put some distance between the 2 of you.  Lack of planning or over planning on her part doesn't constitute a emergency on your part", "No, she's handling her adhd poorly and she expects you to help fix her mismanagement. She's being very unreasonable.\n\nYou need your sleep, you need to study, and you need to be able to keep your own plans and she can not expect you to drop any or all of those just because she mismanaged herself into a corner *again*.\n\nNTA.", "It's your phone your call if it disturbs you sleep or not.", "NTA, but you need to take a giant step back. Coordinate mom stuff with your mom. Skip the babysitting. Protect your own mental health and occasionally encourage your sister to get back on her meds.", "NTA. She has a known medical condition that she refuses to treat that causes a large part of her own issues. Her anxieties are HER problem to address, not something she gets to use as an excuse to control everyone else's lives.", "NTA She needs to figure that all out, whether it means back to therapy or meds or both, without it infringing on your life and plans", "NTA. \n\nFirst, you are not required to be available whenever anyone wants to speak to you. \n\nSecond, this was not an emergency or a situation where you had made yourself available to be in touch, this was your sister deciding it was important. \n\nThird, it was a time you were asleep, so even if you had said you wanted to help plan, the time she selected didn't work for you. \n\nAnd finally, stop letting your sister do this to you. You can be understanding of her challenges and not be a doormat. Start enforcing some boundaries with how your sister uses your time because regardless of her ADHD, she doesn't get to dictate when you are free and how you show up to help. For example, telling you when to go to bed or what day to help move, and if she won't stop that, then stop helping. You can be understanding by letting her go over plans a few times and even agreeing to more detailed plans than you would with someone else- like telling her you have to do X, Y, Z while babysitting/being with her or having precise times- but she is taking it to the extreme. \n\nStop letting her rule the roost, as they say, and make it clear you will not respond to messages on her timeframe, but on yours.", "NTA, she sounds exhausting and I\u2019d limit contact until she does the responsible thing and gets therapy and meds, I know she\u2019s breastfeeding, but if she is this bad she needs to switch to formula.", "I\u2019m guessing your sister doesn\u2019t fully comprehend how multiple messages, changes, and phone calls are landing on you.  She may not want the meds, as is her right. Pullout your phone and literally show her the amount of messages and calls. Give her a specific number (ex 36 texts in 4 days, or 16 attempted calls in 2 days, etc). Quantifying it makes it more concrete. Because, really, it\u2019s not just this one time about a move, is it? She will explain away each small moment (it\u2019s just lunch with dad, you can always have lunch!) and giving her a bigger picture may help. (9 changes of plans in 3 days, for ex). You are NTA at all. There are also non-stimulant meds that help with AD/HD. Just a thought. Good luck!", "Honestly I only read the first like two sentences, I stopped after you said that because your sister had to go off ADHD meds and your comment about that, wasn't about how your sister has been struggling with x or y, it was about how you phrased, \"She's been difficult to deal with.\" That's ablist as fuck. She isn't a misbehaving child. She's an adult with a condition that means she struggles with different things than you do, and all you do is make it all about how much of a burden havjng a relationship with her is. I have ADHD and Ive had a lifetime of allistic people telling me how annoying my ADHDisms are. Guess what? They're part of my personality and who I am, and if it's considered rude to tell you that your personality sucks without there being a 'reason' why you feel the need to be the way you are, then it's extra shitty to say someone's personality sucks because of their biology.

Maybe you and mom can talk it over snd get on the same page? Your sister is manipulating you both with her anger and her diagnosis. It does take resolution to counter this. You could also put it in writing and tell her it's not up for discussion. If she calls?  Tell her you're not discussing it. Change the subject. If she persists, hang up. Leave the room.  She's got you and your mom trained to cater to her. It's hard emotional work to retrain yourself.  Also, see if there's a local group of Adult children of alcoholics snd dysfunctional families.

All these common don't track. I'm looking into myself  and even Mayo Clinic says it's safe.... people love talking out of their asses.", "NTA. I grew up being the most common soother my parent used to calm their anxiety during PTSD episodes. It sounds as though you're currently filling that role for your sister. It SUCKS. It's a huge basic-boundary violation. And there's a good chance she'll redirect that aggression to one of her kids at some point.\n\nWhat follows is purely opinion based on a ridiculous amount of experience with people like this. I have no academic studies to back me up, so take what I say with a grain of salt. That said, I think it might help you reframe the larger situation and deal with it.\n\nBasically, what happens is that the upset person has all this stress and worry inside, right? It's legit. They have a condition that's causing them serious distress. \n\nBut. They haven't learnt -- or they haven't internalised -- how to deal with this distress themselves by working through it. So they can either repress it or externalise it. It's too extreme at this point to repress, so externalise it is.\n\nThey take all that anxiety and stress, and they focus it on **someone else's words and actions**. Now whatever that person says it does is causing the problem, and it's also that person's problem to fix! If the focus person doesn't fix the problem, they're *causing pain and anxiety*. That's the message. \n\nYou can often see them slowly relaxing as they berate or order around the focus person over the course of an hour, or a day, or even a week. Or maybe the focus person begs for forgiveness, or there's a long screaming match, then they vent to family and friends about the focus person. Whichever way it goes, it's about getting those negative emotions out onto an external target, and maybe imposing the internal control they're craving on an external target too.\n\nIt can really feel like it's true in the moment, too. You can feel, as the focus person, as though you are fucking up this poor person's entire day with your sheer incompetence. But if you can take a couple of emotional and mental steps back, you'll find that this perspective isn't generally yours -- it's been imposed by the person with the condition.\n\nBoundaries and grey-rocking.

It feels like if I don\u2019t finish a task immediately it\u2019ll slip out of my brain forever and that can be frustrating. Sometimes I take that out on the people around me because emotional regulation is hard and being controlling feels like it helps in the moment. But it\u2019s ultimately my problem that I have to work around. \n\nThere\u2019s more to managing ADHD than medication, especially symptoms like this that can\u2019t really be medicated away. Anxiety is pretty common with ADHD but there\u2019s plenty of information online about how to manage some of these symptoms.", "NTA set some boundaries with your sister. Set boundaries. I talk to my sister daily, but if I say I\u2019m tired or not dealing with this now. She knows , just like if she expressed it to me. ADHD does not excuse this. Let her know she can\u2019t text and call you at any time just for plans. You have a life outside of her.", "NTA, your sister sounds exhausting!  I would need a lot of alcohol to deal with her.  Can\u2019t you just go LC with her?", "I'd say NTA in general (it's really annoying to have plans changed around like that. ) But I kinda feel for your sister (with the caveat that she should really get some help.) Everyone in my household has ADHD (including me) but I sometimes feel like I'm the one that has to plan everything, and it is exhausting. And knowing how everyone else is in here, sometimes I feel the need to be pushy because I KNOW stuff won't get done. I'm currently on meds but I still had a total meltdown/depressive episode recently because of the pressure. So I feel a bit of sympathy for the sister.", "NTA and \u00ab\u00a0staying up is unhealthy\u00a0\u00bb it was unhealthy to spam you while you slept.", "NTA \nAnd I say this as someone who has been (is still?) In her shoes:\nI have incredibly bad ADHD (coupled with PTSD and GAD it has developed into a subset of OCD) \nIts brutally hard to function. I have 4 kids, 2 with special needs, 2 are also toddlers. Life can be hell. Do you know who's problem it is? Mine. And mine alone. \nIt can feel like everything is going to burn, die, fall apart, and cease to exist if you don't finalize everything as you remember it because you KNOW you're going to forget it. It becomes obsessive. But it was still ON ME to realize this, realize my behaviors can and will harm my loved ones and realize I need help. I'm breastfeeding while medicating my ADHD. And it is getting better. She needs to stop using that as an excuse. Tough love may need to be given to get her where she needs to be. It is not on you to treat her some type of precious way, and put your mental health at risk because she doesn't feel like treating hers. \nDo not set yourself on fire to keep her warm", "NTA strictly, but it kinda feels like the AH is whoever put the person who can't make plans in charge of all the plans.", "NTA. Your phone is not a leash. You are not obligated to respond to anyone.", "NTA.  Your sister has no boundaries, and expects that you be at her beck and call all the time, and change plans on a whim.  You've had moving dates changed as well as your role in the moved changed without even being asked.  That makes her TA.", "NTA.  This is why baby formula exists. I would stop interacting with her - nothing is worth your happiness and peace of mind.", "NTA", "NTA. When this move is done you need to step back from doing too much stuff with your sister. Her adhd is becoming your problem and that's not ok.", "NTA, set boundaries with sister and stick to them.", "You need to let your sister know that she is exhausting to be around and you need downtime away from her for your own self-care. NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu need to learn to set boundaries. YOu have your own life, and that should be your priority over being her caretaker and the 24/7 on call help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince not answering her calls/texts helps with that, it's a great fist step. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet a lot more distance between yourself and your sister.", "NTA\n\nShe's not being a good person off her meds. She needs to take her medical condition seriously. For her children's sake too. It can't be good for kids to grow up in such a chaotic environment constantly.\n\nI'm not saying this to be mean at all. I myself have mental conditions I take meds for. I know it would not only be very hard for me to just exist off my meds, but I also know it would result in me being unpleasant to those around me, who I love. And having grown up around an adult who needed medication and therapy, but who was not getting it, I know exactly how toxic that becomes for the child involved.", "NTA. She has adhd, and she is responsible for managing it. It is unrealistic for her to demand everyone else adjust their lives to her way of thinking. I realize her brain is different and she feels she must proceed in her way. She can listen and understand or at least try to, that others have the right to refuse her demands, even though she doesn\u2019t like it and reacts badly because of it. If she can be medicated again, then she needs to see her doctor. In the mean time she will be mad and upset.", "Her ADHD and she handles it/doesnt handle it, is not your responsibility. Also your mom let her plan the move?? I feel like she isnt the reddest lightbulb in the toolbox if you catch my drift. NTA", "NTA. I have ADHD and see some of my own behaviours in what you say about your sister, but it would be horribly unfair to put my baggage on family/friends and expect them to mould themselves to my preferred way of doing things.\n\n Just because somebody has ADHD doesn't mean they get to control how things are organised.", "NTA. Your sisters issues aren\u2019t her fault, but they are her responsibility. \n\nYou need to take care of yourself first, and then take care of others. \n\nOnly healthy boundaries will let you create healthy relationships.", "NTA. You were trying to sleep. Most people when they don't get an answer understand that everyone has their own lives and will get back when they can. I'd stop doing stuff with/for her, at least for a while.", "NTA.  It's quite telling that you feel guilty about this at all.  I would imagine that you've spent a lifetime being told that it's your responsibility to manage her mental illness.  \n\nSometimes whole family dynamics are centered around \"not upsetting\" one volatile member, as if feels like the easiest path to just avoid rocking the boat.  But that's a short term solution for a long term problem that gets worse and worse when it's not properly addressed. \n\nYou cannot choose how people act, you can only choose how **you** react to them.  It's okay to set boundaries. It's okay to shut off your phone in order to sleep.  It's okay to say \"I'm available to talk about this from 3-5pm on Fridays, and if you miss that window too bad, try again next Friday\".  It sounds impossibly hard when the expectation is that you'll always bend to her will, but you can change this if you want to.  \n\nUltimately if she is not willing to address her own issues, you can't make her change or take care of herself.  But you **can** change how your own life is affected by her actions.", "NTA.  I honestly don't get the whole mind set of 'I texted someone.  I don't have a clue if they are busy, awake, with someone else, or otherwise engaged, but I expect, nay, I DEMAND that they respond to my text IMMEDIATELY!!!'\n\nBelieve it or not, my phone is not in my hand 24/7.  Hell, half the time I don't even know where it is.  Just because you are calling or texting me does not mean that I am at your beck and call.  Voice mail exists for a reason.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA. She is planning, you are execution. She needs to get back on medication.", "NTA. Your sister is just being an AH. She know she has a problem and isn't even trying.", "I had a baby this year and breastfeeding was difficult. I also finally got diagnosed with ADHD myself and got on meds, eventually deciding to give up on BF. It made me feel like I failed at yet another thing because I couldn't power through it because of my issues. This is even when acknowledging that meds made me a better mom. So I can totally see why OPs sister is resistant to give up BF.", "Just because someone is unmedicated and neurodivergent doesn't mean that they can't plan things. I got officially diagnosed this year at age 40 and have only been on meds less than a year. So basically I've handled myself for years and have even planned moves and trips and managed college degrees without meds. It was hard sometimes but I was still a responsible adult. I wonder if the sister has always been the one the parents relied on and there's a reason she can be pushy like that (I speak from experience. )", "This. This is what it's all about!!", "Why not just *always* turn on dnd when you're done with the day? Let your sister know that your phone's going to be off between, say, 9 pm to 8 am, and that that's not negotiable. Because it seems like a huge part of the problem is that her ability to constantly message you means that you are constantly getting *all* of her changes in plans, *and* she expects that merely notifying you of something is sufficient for you to have to change *your* plans.\n\nTurning your phone off is absolutely your right, and on most phones you can fine-tune dnd to allow calls from certain numbers to go through. (You can also often set it to allow through anyone who calls 3x, but that seems like something your sister would just abuse.) So you could let mom's and dad's calls come through, but not sis. \\[fuck, you could also just regularly block her number at 9 pm and unblock it the next morning at 8 if all else fails.\\]\n\nWhen sister says BUT WHAT IF EMERGENCEEEEE, pick someone your sister respects and/or doesn't know well, and tell her look, if it's a true emergency, you call that person, and they'll be able to get in touch with me, but you've lost your overnight call privileges by being so stressful and over the top.\n\nYour sister's clearly the AH here, but you're enabling her, and that doesn't make you an AH but it does mean you need to stop letting her control you.\n\n*edit: fwiw, I have ADHD that was untreated for years and also have anxiety, but I was still able to set myself boundaries and respect that my problems are not automatically also other people's problems, so while I think untreated ADHD is one of the issues here, the main issue is that she doesn't respect you.*", "The DND function is there for a reason. No one has to be on call 24/7 for whomever decides to contact them. \n\nAdults generally recognize that they cannot dictate the schedule of other adults. In betting your sister gounded you until you did what she wanted throughout your childhood, too. That could be why you think it's normal.", "Good. You need your rest and she doesn't respect your time. She can't dictate how you act, only how she does so she needs to fix herself.", "Which you have every right to do! Your time is yours. You are not her employee. You are not on the clock. If you don't put your foot down soon this will never stop.", "Wait, so she changed the move date and your function in the move..but now she can't schedule the van without your express consent? \n\nShe is giving you anxiety from her untreated ADHD. It's tough but you NEED to set and maintain boundaries with her. I don't care what reason she has for being off medication, she needs to up her therapy then. \n\nYou could also use therapy to help you unpack all the emotional abuse you've been forced to take from your sister. Make no mistake, it IS emotional abuse she is doing to you.", "She needed you immediately to confirm that the times were okay, yet had no problem not confirming that the day was okay? NTA.", "It\u2019s very difficult for her to realize how disruptive she can be if everyone around her is adjusting themselves to her behavior. This is why it\u2019s called \u201cenabling.\u201d If you guys stopped letting her dictate your behavior, she might begin to understand that she needs to take responsibility for her own. \n\nIn other words, remove the safety net. That\u2019s not to say that you don\u2019t love her and wouldn\u2019t support her should she go back to therapy and consider restarting meds. You can say, \u201cI love you and I will do everything in my power to help \u2014 but only if you\u2019re in treatment. If you\u2019re not in treatment, I won\u2019t allow you to damage my life with your inability to function. Get help and I will back you 100%. Don\u2019t get help and you\u2019re on your own.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s really very similar to interacting with someone who is refusing treatment for addiction.", "You are a rockstar for doing 100% the right thing. You\u2019re absolutely *not* a failure. You understood that being the best mom you can be was more important than a year or two of breastfeeding if the meds were incompatible with that. Plenty of women are unable to breastfeed for a whole bunch of reasons that aren\u2019t in their control, and you can think of yourself as one of them. You have a condition the treatment for which makes breastfeeding a no-go, and you\u2019re mature and responsible enough to make the right treatment decisions for you *and* your child. <3", "So in this specific context, his sister no longer goes to therapy and is not medicated because of having kids. So there is a good chance she still needs to be medicated and is most likely overwhelmed and that is why she's acting like she is acting. This was not meant as an insult towards you or anyone else with ADHD. There are three other people involved here and the sister, who has her own family, shouldn't be the one doing this but I think she's the one driving. \nI am aware people with ADHD can still plan things and function.", "I gave DND on from 10:30 pm to 8am. I have break-through for certain family. Mom included - so when she decides she wants a video call at 1am (we\u2019re 6 hours apart), I reject the call.\n\nThen I get about 5 text messages saying the video didn\u2019t work. Just because your sister has time, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s convenient for you to talk or message.", "It definitely can help. ADHD causes all sorts of anxiety and therapy can help provide proper ways to deal with that anxiety. Depression is often comorbid with ADHD as well.", "I'm aware as I've been dealing with severe ADHD my entire life and from my experience, the anxiety and depression goes away with meds because meds actually gives you the will to do things.", "Respectfully, your experience isn't universal. For a lot of us, therapy helps develop coping mechanisms that work alongside the medication. Yes, sister's probably going to get a better result if she gets back on medication, but it doesn't mean therapy has nothing to offer her.", "I guess YMMV, I've tried just meds for it but get a significantly better grip on things when combined with therapy."]}
