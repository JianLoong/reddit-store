Making plans with her is stressful, because she can\u2019t commit to anything without changing the plans multiple times. If we have plans that I\u2019ll go babysit her kids, I can expect to be called about it 5 times the day of, so she can run through what\u2019s happening and if there have been any changes that she needs to tell me about. She has also become a bit controlling. If I\u2019m not doing what she thinks is right, it\u2019ll stress her out and she\u2019ll become unpleasant. The other day I spent the night at her house, but told her I needed to do school stuff in the evening. She was ok with it, but then when I was staying up til aroun 12am to finish it, she kept telling me to go to bed, staying up is unhealthy and getting irritated that I\u2019m not listening to her.

I was mad, because the day she moved it to was a day where I already had plans of my own with our dad who is also supposed to be moving help (they\u2019re divorced). So she essentially cancelled our plans and made us switch days with the move and our own plans. I told her it was fine eventually because I want to help mom. \n\nAfter I\u2019d told her I was ok with the change of days I went back to bed because it was very early in the morning and I\u2019d had a rough night the day before. I could hear her still messaging me, but I just put on do not disturb and fell asleep. When I woke up, she had called me twice and left me 14 texts that I can\u2019t read because they were deleted. The only one I could see was one where she informed me of the time I need to be at my moms house and ones where she gave me shit for not picking up and being an active part of planning this and not being allowed to chip in the plans if I won\u2019t be on my phone when she needs to talk about it. Apparently her planning is that time sensetive. I just pretty much ignored her messages.  \n\nShe says I\u2019m TA for ignoring her. I think I\u2019m not because she can\u2019t demand me to be ready to plan with her the moment she chooses, especially because I was tired and planning with her is a literal nightmare. But I guess the reason I think I might be TA is that I conciously ignored her and let her get stressed about it and choosing to go to sleep instead.

I'm not going after people with ADHD. I am aware that people with ADHD can function and plan things. The sister in this story did not go off meds because she managed it well, it's because she is breast feeding. She has a kid, kids? OP clarified that the sister is organizing because she's probably going to be driving the moving van. \n\nWhy is an unmedicated person with ADHD having to plan someone else's move? That's pretty much asking for this to happen. NTA for you though. I'm mildly amused you're almost trying to argue that you are the Asshole in the comments. You're really not.", "NTA. Let\u2019s hope she is done with breastfeeding soon cause it seems she should be on her medication again\u2026. at least do therapy.", "NTA but - it's not clear to me that you have set clear boundaries snd communicated them to her. You want to do this not in reaction to a specific instance of her changing plans, but at another time. Sit her down snd explain what she can expect from you going forward. For example, it might be that if you've made other plans you won't change them; you are not available for calls between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., etc. So you don't tell her what she can and can't do, just what you will do.", "NTA but you could have said you were going to bed", "You\u2019re allowed to ignore annoying people.", "Nta you know what the kids need even more than breast milk? A stable mom.  She needs to switch to formula and go back on meds bc it's affecting her and her family's lives.", "NTA dn go NC with her as soon as you can.", "I have adhd and this sound stressful even ti me\nNTA", "NTA. Your sister is just being an AH. She know she has a problem and isn't even trying. And being inconsiderate . I'd do more avoiding until she gets herself in check. Starting drama and being bossy is not a side effect of adhd", "NTA and I would tell her that she's TA for steamrolling everybody in the family all the time for whatever suits her. She doesn't have a lock on being right, or what is best for everybody all the time and she needs to back off and give everybody space.", "It\u2019s true I was sleeping, but I also knew she was calling and messaging and turned on dnd so I guess that\u2019s the part I call ignoring and going to sleep instead", "You\u2019re right it wasn\u2019t an emergency, but I guess she wanted me to confirm times that are ok with me before booking a van for the move. And apparently it had to be done then. Those time rules are good. She actually called me a bit before 8 so it wasn\u2019t crazy early, but because I\u2019d had a rough night I wanted to sleep in til noon. Like I said I can be a night owl. So I was off radar til then. But around 8 I had told her I would show up and then went dark. \n\nI could have told her I wanted sleep then and that I\u2019d had a eough night, but it would have just resulted in her asking questions and telling me sleeping in is bad.", "Well actually she is still breastfeeding her newest baby. But I think even after she is finished, she will be unlikely to want to take them due to how they make her feel", "I\u2019m not arguing that I\u2019m TA, I\u2019m just giving more context and details of her feelings and my own. But yeah she is organizing it, because my mom doesn\u2019t have a car and neither do I. Me or mom don\u2019t have licences either. Also she likes to take charge and control things she is involved in so that\u2019s why I guess. My mom is also doing the move inorder to be closer to her so she can help out with the kids so I guess my sister wants to help her back", "I\u2019ve not done that, you\u2019re right. The reason is really stupid too. The reason is that it makes me uncomfortable and I want to avoid the inevitable drama of it. My mom has tried, but it causes my sisted to fly off the handle with her. My sister can get really agressively angry very fast and mom gets the worst of it.", "Yes I agree. I didn\u2019t, because I knew she would question it and tell me it\u2019s bad to sleep in like she has before and I just wanted to avoid that. I was too tired to deal with it.", "I agree fully, but she either doesn\u2019t think she is unstable or doesn\u2019t want to face it", "Are you not allowed to sleep just in case she must get ahold of you? Odds are all you missed was her changing the plans over and over.", "She has ADHD so of course she needed to fix it right away. It\u2019s not really her fault, but it\u2019s not yours either. She needs help. ADHD with kids just brings more chaos so she should talk to a professional.", "Any chance that she could switch to baby formula?   Probably not, but it's definitely an alternate solution.  At the very least she needs to be encouraged to see a therapist.   Medications are evolving and side effects are declining in general.   You are not required to readjust your life for her benefit.", "Yeah you\u2019re right about that!", "Agreed. She doesn\u2019t want to do that for whatever reason even though she used to be in therapy", "Yes I agree with you. My sister gets pretty irritated if anyone comments on meds or therapy. I guess she thinks she doesn\u2019t need them or that they aren\u2019t of help or something. She doesn\u2019t see herself as being that big of a problem", "Last I heard you cannot take stimulant medication with breast feeding. I understand things are tough for you, but unmedicated adhd and a newborn sounds like a nightmare", "NTA. Set some boundaries with your time. She is treating you like her personal slave and that isn't fair.", "OMG stop responding to her promptly/taking her calls. Don't babysit for her or go to her house. She needs to get back to managing her own damn self and maybe then you can do her favors or whatever. NTA.", "NTA & maybe time to put some distance between the 2 of you.  Lack of planning or over planning on her part doesn't constitute a emergency on your part", "No, she's handling her adhd poorly and she expects you to help fix her mismanagement. She's being very unreasonable.\n\nYou need your sleep, you need to study, and you need to be able to keep your own plans and she can not expect you to drop any or all of those just because she mismanaged herself into a corner *again*.\n\nNTA.", "It's your phone your call if it disturbs you sleep or not.", "NTA, but you need to take a giant step back. Coordinate mom stuff with your mom. Skip the babysitting. Protect your own mental health and occasionally encourage your sister to get back on her meds.", "NTA. She has a known medical condition that she refuses to treat that causes a large part of her own issues. Her anxieties are HER problem to address, not something she gets to use as an excuse to control everyone else's lives.", "NTA She needs to figure that all out, whether it means back to therapy or meds or both, without it infringing on your life and plans", "NTA. \n\nFirst, you are not required to be available whenever anyone wants to speak to you. \n\nSecond, this was not an emergency or a situation where you had made yourself available to be in touch, this was your sister deciding it was important. \n\nThird, it was a time you were asleep, so even if you had said you wanted to help plan, the time she selected didn't work for you. \n\nAnd finally, stop letting your sister do this to you. You can be understanding of her challenges and not be a doormat. Start enforcing some boundaries with how your sister uses your time because regardless of her ADHD, she doesn't get to dictate when you are free and how you show up to help. For example, telling you when to go to bed or what day to help move, and if she won't stop that, then stop helping. You can be understanding by letting her go over plans a few times and even agreeing to more detailed plans than you would with someone else- like telling her you have to do X, Y, Z while babysitting/being with her or having precise times- but she is taking it to the extreme. \n\nStop letting her rule the roost, as they say, and make it clear you will not respond to messages on her timeframe, but on yours.", "NTA, she sounds exhausting and I\u2019d limit contact until she does the responsible thing and gets therapy and meds, I know she\u2019s breastfeeding, but if she is this bad she needs to switch to formula.", "I\u2019m guessing your sister doesn\u2019t fully comprehend how multiple messages, changes, and phone calls are landing on you.  She may not want the meds, as is her right. Pullout your phone and literally show her the amount of messages and calls. Give her a specific number (ex 36 texts in 4 days, or 16 attempted calls in 2 days, etc). Quantifying it makes it more concrete. Because, really, it\u2019s not just this one time about a move, is it? She will explain away each small moment (it\u2019s just lunch with dad, you can always have lunch!) and giving her a bigger picture may help. (9 changes of plans in 3 days, for ex). You are NTA at all. There are also non-stimulant meds that help with AD/HD. Just a thought. Good luck!", "Honestly I only read the first like two sentences, I stopped after you said that because your sister had to go off ADHD meds and your comment about that, wasn't about how your sister has been struggling with x or y, it was about how you phrased, \"She's been difficult to deal with.\" That's ablist as fuck. She isn't a misbehaving child. She's an adult with a condition that means she struggles with different things than you do, and all you do is make it all about how much of a burden havjng a relationship with her is. I have ADHD and Ive had a lifetime of allistic people telling me how annoying my ADHDisms are. Guess what? They're part of my personality and who I am, and if it's considered rude to tell you that your personality sucks without there being a 'reason' why you feel the need to be the way you are, then it's extra shitty to say someone's personality sucks because of their biology.

Maybe you and mom can talk it over snd get on the same page? Your sister is manipulating you both with her anger and her diagnosis. It does take resolution to counter this. You could also put it in writing and tell her it's not up for discussion. If she calls?  Tell her you're not discussing it. Change the subject. If she persists, hang up. Leave the room.  She's got you and your mom trained to cater to her. It's hard emotional work to retrain yourself.  Also, see if there's a local group of Adult children of alcoholics snd dysfunctional families.

All these common don't track. I'm looking into myself  and even Mayo Clinic says it's safe.... people love talking out of their asses.", "NTA. I grew up being the most common soother my parent used to calm their anxiety during PTSD episodes. It sounds as though you're currently filling that role for your sister. It SUCKS. It's a huge basic-boundary violation. And there's a good chance she'll redirect that aggression to one of her kids at some point.\n\nWhat follows is purely opinion based on a ridiculous amount of personal experience with people like this (because I sought them out for way too long). I have no academic studies to back me up, so take what I say with a grain of salt. That said, I think it might help you reframe the larger situation and deal with it.\n\nBasically, what happens is that the upset person has all this stress and worry inside, right? It's legit. They have a condition that's causing them serious distress. \n\nBut. They haven't learnt -- or they haven't internalised -- how to deal with this distress themselves by working through it. So they can either repress it or externalise it. It's too extreme at this point to repress, so externalise it is.\n\nThey take all that anxiety and stress, and they focus it on **someone else's words and actions**. Now whatever that person says it does is causing the problem, and it's also that person's problem to fix! If the focus person doesn't fix the problem, they're *causing pain and anxiety*. That's the message. \n\nYou can often see them slowly relaxing as they berate or order around the focus person over the course of an hour, or a day, or even a week. Or maybe the focus person begs for forgiveness, or there's a long screaming match, then they vent to family and friends about the focus person. Whichever way it goes, it's about getting those negative emotions out onto an external target, and maybe imposing the internal control they're craving on an external target too.\n\nIt can really feel like it's true in the moment, too. You can feel, as the focus person, as though you are fucking up this poor person's entire day with your sheer incompetence. But if you can take a couple of emotional and mental steps back, you'll find that this perspective isn't generally yours -- it's been imposed by the person with the condition.\n\nBoundaries and grey-rocking. Boundaries to limit your exposure to her behaviour; grey-rocking to limit her opportunities to benefit from her externalisation-soothing tactics.\n\n* *I'm limiting the hours you can call me to 11am-9pm.*\n* *Once you make plans that rely on my help, and I agree to help, you can make **one** change to the plan, with my approval only.
