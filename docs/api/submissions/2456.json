She also isn\u2019t medicated anymore, because of having kids and needing to breastfeed for a few years now. It has made her difficult to deal with. Making plans with her is stressful, because she can\u2019t commit to anything without changing the plans multiple times. If we have plans that I\u2019ll go babysit her kids, I can expect to be called about it 5 times the day of, so she can run through what\u2019s happening and if there have been any changes that she needs to tell me about. She has also become a bit controlling. If I\u2019m not doing what she thinks is right, it\u2019ll stress her out and she\u2019ll become unpleasant. The other day I spent the night at her house, but told her I needed to do school stuff in the evening. She was ok with it, but then when I was staying up til aroun 12am to finish it, she kept telling me to go to bed, staying up is unhealthy and getting irritated that I\u2019m not listening to her. Later I found out that she\u2019d called our mom to complain and say that I\u2019m \u201ddoing bad with school stress\u201d. It\u2019s just not true! I was irritable because of HER. And also I\u2019ve always been a night owl, she knows that. \n\nSo to the current issue. Out mom is moving and sister is organizing it. I was asked to be the babysitter for the move day. Then she called and told me the move day had been changed and I was needed as general move help and not babysitting. I was mad, because the day she moved it to was a day where I already had plans of my own with our dad who is also supposed to be moving help (they\u2019re divorced). So she essentially cancelled our plans and made us switch days with the move and our own plans. I told her it was fine eventually because I want to help mom. \n\nAfter I\u2019d told her I was ok with the change of days I went back to bed because it was very early in the morning and I\u2019d had a rough night the day before. I could hear her still messaging me, but I just put on do not disturb and fell asleep. When I woke up, she had called me twice and left me 14 texts that I can\u2019t read because they were deleted. The only one I could see was one where she informed me of the time I need to be at my moms house and ones where she gave me shit for not picking up and being an active part of planning this and not being allowed to chip in the plans if I won\u2019t be on my phone when she needs to talk about it. Apparently her planning is that time sensetive. I just pretty much ignored her messages.  \n\nShe says I\u2019m TA for ignoring her. I think I\u2019m not because she can\u2019t demand me to be ready to plan with her the moment she chooses, especially because I was tired and planning with her is a literal nightmare. But I guess the reason I think I might be TA is that I conciously ignored her and let her get stressed about it and choosing to go to sleep instead. All I had told her is that I would show up to help, but nothing else.

Let\u2019s hope she is done with breastfeeding soon cause it seems she should be on her medication again\u2026. at least do therapy.", "NTA but - it's not clear to me that you have set clear boundaries snd communicated them to her. You want to do this not in reaction to a specific instance of her changing plans, but at another time. Sit her down snd explain what she can expect from you going forward. For example, it might be that if you've made other plans you won't change them; you are not available for calls between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., etc. So you don't tell her what she can and can't do, just what you will do.", "NTA but you could have said you were going to bed", "You\u2019re allowed to ignore annoying people.", "Nta you know what the kids need even more than breast milk?

And apparently it had to be done then. Those time rules are good. She actually called me a bit before 8 so it wasn\u2019t crazy early, but because I\u2019d had a rough night I wanted to sleep in til noon. Like I said I can be a night owl. So I was off radar til then.

But yeah she is organizing it, because my mom doesn\u2019t have a car and neither do I. Me or mom don\u2019t have licences either. Also she likes to take charge and control things she is involved in so that\u2019s why I guess. My mom is also doing the move inorder to be closer to her so she can help out with the kids so I guess my sister wants to help her back", "I\u2019ve not done that, you\u2019re right. The reason is really stupid too. The reason is that it makes me uncomfortable and I want to avoid the inevitable drama of it. My mom has tried, but it causes my sisted to fly off the handle with her.

I didn\u2019t, because I knew she would question it and tell me it\u2019s bad to sleep in like she has before and I just wanted to avoid that.

She needs help. ADHD with kids just brings more chaos so she should talk to a professional.", "Any chance that she could switch to baby formula?   Probably not, but it's definitely an alternate solution.  At the very least she needs to be encouraged to see a therapist.   Medications are evolving and side effects are declining in general.   You are not required to readjust your life for her benefit.", "Yeah you\u2019re right about that!", "Agreed. She doesn\u2019t want to do that for whatever reason even though she used to be in therapy", "Yes I agree with you. My sister gets pretty irritated if anyone comments on meds or therapy. I guess she thinks she doesn\u2019t need them or that they aren\u2019t of help or something.

I understand things are tough for you, but unmedicated adhd and a newborn sounds like a nightmare", "NTA. Set some boundaries with your time. She is treating you like her personal slave and that isn't fair.", "OMG stop responding to her promptly/taking her calls. Don't babysit for her or go to her house. She needs to get back to managing her own damn self and maybe then you can do her favors or whatever. NTA.", "NTA & maybe time to put some distance between the 2 of you.  Lack of planning or over planning on her part doesn't constitute a emergency on your part", "No, she's handling her adhd poorly and she expects you to help fix her mismanagement. She's being very unreasonable.\n\nYou need your sleep, you need to study, and you need to be able to keep your own plans and she can not expect you to drop any or all of those just because she mismanaged herself into a corner *again*.\n\nNTA.", "It's your phone your call if it disturbs you sleep or not.", "NTA, but you need to take a giant step back. Coordinate mom stuff with your mom. Skip the babysitting. Protect your own mental health and occasionally encourage your sister to get back on her meds.", "NTA. She has a known medical condition that she refuses to treat that causes a large part of her own issues. Her anxieties are HER problem to address, not something she gets to use as an excuse to control everyone else's lives.", "NTA She needs to figure that all out, whether it means back to therapy or meds or both, without it infringing on your life and plans", "NTA. \n\nFirst, you are not required to be available whenever anyone wants to speak to you. \n\nSecond, this was not an emergency or a situation where you had made yourself available to be in touch, this was your sister deciding it was important. \n\nThird, it was a time you were asleep, so even if you had said you wanted to help plan, the time she selected didn't work for you. \n\nAnd finally, stop letting your sister do this to you. You can be understanding of her challenges and not be a doormat. Start enforcing some boundaries with how your sister uses your time because regardless of her ADHD, she doesn't get to dictate when you are free and how you show up to help. For example, telling you when to go to bed or what day to help move, and if she won't stop that, then stop helping. You can be understanding by letting her go over plans a few times and even agreeing to more detailed plans than you would with someone else- like telling her you have to do X, Y, Z while babysitting/being with her or having precise times- but she is taking it to the extreme. \n\nStop letting her rule the roost, as they say, and make it clear you will not respond to messages on her timeframe, but on yours.", "NTA, she sounds exhausting and I\u2019d limit contact until she does the responsible thing and gets therapy and meds, I know she\u2019s breastfeeding, but if she is this bad she needs to switch to formula.", "I\u2019m guessing your sister doesn\u2019t fully comprehend how multiple messages, changes, and phone calls are landing on you.  She may not want the meds, as is her right. Pullout your phone and literally show her the amount of messages and calls. Give her a specific number (ex 36 texts in 4 days, or 16 attempted calls in 2 days, etc). Quantifying it makes it more concrete. Because, really, it\u2019s not just this one time about a move, is it? She will explain away each small moment (it\u2019s just lunch with dad, you can always have lunch!) and giving her a bigger picture may help. (9 changes of plans in 3 days, for ex). You are NTA at all. There are also non-stimulant meds that help with AD/HD. Just a thought. Good luck!", "Honestly I only read the first like two sentences, I stopped after you said that because your sister had to go off ADHD meds and your comment about that, wasn't about how your sister has been struggling with x or y, it was about how you phrased, \"She's been difficult to deal with.\" That's ablist as fuck. She isn't a misbehaving child. She's an adult with a condition that means she struggles with different things than you do, and all you do is make it all about how much of a burden havjng a relationship with her is. I have ADHD and Ive had a lifetime of allistic people telling me how annoying my ADHDisms are. Guess what? They're part of my personality and who I am, and if it's considered rude to tell you that your personality sucks without there being a 'reason' why you feel the need to be the way you are, then it's extra shitty to say someone's personality sucks because of their biology.

Maybe you and mom can talk it over snd get on the same page? Your sister is manipulating you both with her anger and her diagnosis. It does take resolution to counter this. You could also put it in writing and tell her it's not up for discussion. If she calls?  Tell her you're not discussing it. Change the subject. If she persists, hang up. Leave the room.  She's got you and your mom trained to cater to her. It's hard emotional work to retrain yourself.  Also, see if there's a local group of Adult children of alcoholics snd dysfunctional families. That would be a great source of peer support because most people from dysfunctional families are co-dependent and sharing how to deal with that is a huge benefit of peer support.", "Not her life not her decision. I sleep in regularly and take naps. People who don\u2019t like it can suck it LOL.", "Yes!!! If she has no receivers for her manipulation she loses her ability to manipulate. So no longer be a receiver.", "So there\u2019s a lot of anxiety that comes with untreated ADHD, because if X isn\u2019t handled *right now* it might be forgotten. I know what that\u2019s like personally - I struggle with it daily. But I can\u2019t make it someone else\u2019s burden. I would have no friends if I did. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to coordinate with multiple people, and sometimes not everyone\u2019s schedules can align, and no extra planning can fix it. She needs to learn that.
