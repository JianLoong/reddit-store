She also isn\u2019t medicated anymore, because of having kids and needing to breastfeed for a few years now. It has made her difficult to deal with. Making plans with her is stressful, because she can\u2019t commit to anything without changing the plans multiple times. If we have plans that I\u2019ll go babysit her kids, I can expect to be called about it 5 times the day of, so she can run through what\u2019s happening and if there have been any changes that she needs to tell me about. She has also become a bit controlling. If I\u2019m not doing what she thinks is right, it\u2019ll stress her out and she\u2019ll become unpleasant. The other day I spent the night at her house, but told her I needed to do school stuff in the evening. She was ok with it, but then when I was staying up til aroun 12am to finish it, she kept telling me to go to bed, staying up is unhealthy and getting irritated that I\u2019m not listening to her. Later I found out that she\u2019d called our mom to complain and say that I\u2019m \u201ddoing bad with school stress\u201d. It\u2019s just not true! I was irritable because of HER. And also I\u2019ve always been a night owl, she knows that. \n\nSo to the current issue. Out mom is moving and sister is organizing it. I was asked to be the babysitter for the move day. Then she called and told me the move day had been changed and I was needed as general move help and not babysitting. I was mad, because the day she moved it to was a day where I already had plans of my own with our dad who is also supposed to be moving help (they\u2019re divorced). So she essentially cancelled our plans and made us switch days with the move and our own plans. I told her it was fine eventually because I want to help mom. \n\nAfter I\u2019d told her I was ok with the change of days I went back to bed because it was very early in the morning and I\u2019d had a rough night the day before. I could hear her still messaging me, but I just put on do not disturb and fell asleep. When I woke up, she had called me twice and left me 14 texts that I can\u2019t read because they were deleted. The only one I could see was one where she informed me of the time I need to be at my moms house and ones where she gave me shit for not picking up and being an active part of planning this and not being allowed to chip in the plans if I won\u2019t be on my phone when she needs to talk about it. Apparently her planning is that time sensetive. I just pretty much ignored her messages.  \n\nShe says I\u2019m TA for ignoring her. I think I\u2019m not because she can\u2019t demand me to be ready to plan with her the moment she chooses, especially because I was tired and planning with her is a literal nightmare. But I guess the reason I think I might be TA is that I conciously ignored her and let her get stressed about it and choosing to go to sleep instead. All I had told her is that I would show up to help, but nothing else.

Honestly, I feel for her, adhd can be exhausting, but she seems to be taking over too much of your life and not consider how her actions affect other people who have their lives and plans. People know not to call other people until at least 8 am unless it's an emergency, and from the sound of it, it wasn't an emergency, she just wanted to talk NOW, no matter how inconvenient it is to you. Tell her that you don't answer phone from 10 pm till 8 am, and while you are at work, and that's it. She can learn how to be more considerate of other people's time.", "Sometimes you gotta take care of yourself too.. NTA", "NTA \n\nYour mental health is important.

No mention that she is breast feeding, so that must not be an issue at this time.", "NTA - you were tired and wanted to sleep. It wasn\u2019t anything urgent which needed addressing", "NTA-- The only thing I would suggest you could do differently is let her know ahead of time that you're turning your phone off. It's not necessary, but at least it won't come as a shock to her you aren't answering. I don't suppose you will get her to respect your boundaries, but it might help you if you know you have done all you could to be fair.", "NTA- As some people said, you got a life bro, ahe shouldn't be expecting you to be available 24/7 for her, well you gotta get in some agreements with her and tell how controlling she's being Ig", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's pretty much asking for this to happen. NTA for you though. I'm mildly amused you're almost trying to argue that you are the Asshole in the comments. You're really not.", "NTA. Let\u2019s hope she is done with breastfeeding soon cause it seems she should be on her medication again\u2026. at least do therapy.", "NTA but - it's not clear to me that you have set clear boundaries snd communicated them to her. You want to do this not in reaction to a specific instance of her changing plans, but at another time. Sit her down snd explain what she can expect from you going forward. For example, it might be that if you've made other plans you won't change them; you are not available for calls between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., etc. So you don't tell her what she can and can't do, just what you will do.", "NTA but you could have said you were going to bed", "You\u2019re allowed to ignore annoying people.", "Nta you know what the kids need even more than breast milk? A stable mom.  She needs to switch to formula and go back on meds bc it's affecting her and her family's lives.", "NTA dn go NC with her as soon as you can.", "I have adhd and this sound stressful even ti me\nNTA", "NTA. Your sister is just being an AH. She know she has a problem and isn't even trying. And being inconsiderate . I'd do more avoiding until she gets herself in check. Starting drama and being bossy is not a side effect of adhd", "NTA and I would tell her that she's TA for steamrolling everybody in the family all the time for whatever suits her. She doesn't have a lock on being right, or what is best for everybody all the time and she needs to back off and give everybody space.", "It\u2019s true I was sleeping, but I also knew she was calling and messaging and turned on dnd so I guess that\u2019s the part I call ignoring and going to sleep instead", "You\u2019re right it wasn\u2019t an emergency, but I guess she wanted me to confirm times that are ok with me before booking a van for the move. And apparently it had to be done then. Those time rules are good. She actually called me a bit before 8 so it wasn\u2019t crazy early, but because I\u2019d had a rough night I wanted to sleep in til noon. Like I said I can be a night owl. So I was off radar til then. But around 8 I had told her I would show up and then went dark. \n\nI could have told her I wanted sleep then and that I\u2019d had a eough night, but it would have just resulted in her asking questions and telling me sleeping in is bad.", "Well actually she is still breastfeeding her newest baby. But I think even after she is finished, she will be unlikely to want to take them due to how they make her feel", "I\u2019m not arguing that I\u2019m TA, I\u2019m just giving more context and details of her feelings and my own. But yeah she is organizing it, because my mom doesn\u2019t have a car and neither do I. Me or mom don\u2019t have licences either. Also she likes to take charge and control things she is involved in so that\u2019s why I guess. My mom is also doing the move inorder to be closer to her so she can help out with the kids so I guess my sister wants to help her back", "I\u2019ve not done that, you\u2019re right. The reason is really stupid too. The reason is that it makes me uncomfortable and I want to avoid the inevitable drama of it. My mom has tried, but it causes my sisted to fly off the handle with her. My sister can get really agressively angry very fast and mom gets the worst of it.", "Yes I agree. I didn\u2019t, because I knew she would question it and tell me it\u2019s bad to sleep in like she has before and I just wanted to avoid that. I was too tired to deal with it.", "I agree fully, but she either doesn\u2019t think she is unstable or doesn\u2019t want to face it", "Are you not allowed to sleep just in case she must get ahold of you? Odds are all you missed was her changing the plans over and over.", "She has ADHD so of course she needed to fix it right away. It\u2019s not really her fault, but it\u2019s not yours either. She needs help. ADHD with kids just brings more chaos so she should talk to a professional.", "Any chance that she could switch to baby formula?   Probably not, but it's definitely an alternate solution.  At the very least she needs to be encouraged to see a therapist.   Medications are evolving and side effects are declining in general.   You are not required to readjust your life for her benefit.", "Yeah you\u2019re right about that!", "Agreed. She doesn\u2019t want to do that for whatever reason even though she used to be in therapy", "Yes I agree with you. My sister gets pretty irritated if anyone comments on meds or therapy. I guess she thinks she doesn\u2019t need them or that they aren\u2019t of help or something. She doesn\u2019t see herself as being that big of a problem", "Last I heard you cannot take stimulant medication with breast feeding. I understand things are tough for you, but unmedicated adhd and a newborn sounds like a nightmare"]}
