When I was 5 my dad bought me a locket with pictures of him, my mom, my sister and brother (both older). When I was 7 my dad and sister died in a car accident. My locket became something so treasured I wore it all the time and didn't care if it was a formal event or not.\n\nWhen I was 8 my mom remarried. Mom's husband is Jeff. Jeff had a 1 year old called Nathan whose mom was not in the picture. Mom and Jeff than had two daughters together pretty quickly. My locket was something they all knew about because they'd see me wear it. Mom asked me a couple of times to add Jeff, Nathan and the girls and I told her I didn't want to. So when I was 16 mom and Jeff bought me a new locket with their photos in it. I never wore it put I put it in a jewelry box I own. There were some comments and tensions that I never wore the new one. My half sisters were upset about me not changing which one I wore all the time. I explained why the original was special and they told me the new one was more special because it included them. My mom was annoyed at me for how I handled it and Jeff bitched at me for not appreciating what they did for me.\n\nI'm 19 now and I live in a small apartment. My brother lives with his girlfriend. A couple of weeks ago we stayed at my brother's house and when I woke up that morning, my locket had been moved (I don't wear it to bed in case it breaks). Went about my day and that weekend. When I got home a couple of days later I wanted  to look at the photos inside and noticed they'd taken out my dad's photo and tried to squeeze in Jeff, Nathan and the girls. I was angry. I called mom and asked her if she'd seen my locket and she told me I drove them to do what they did because I was selfish and inconsiderate and broke their hearts for the last three years by showing which locket I favored and which family I favored as well. She hung up on me.\n\nI tried to calm down went over to their house (mom and Jeff's) and I told them they had no right to touch my locket. Jeff told me they had every right to show a more accurate representation of my family and that I was hurting Nathan and the girls by wearing something that didn't include them when I had something that did. I lost it. I told them they did not have that right and they do not get to tell me who I carry around in my locket or not. I told him he would never be deserving of a spot, told mom she had lost her spot and then I left saying they needed to stay the hell away from me.\n\nMy brother couldn't believe they did it. Sided with me. Told mom to accept we didn't feel the way she wanted us to feel. Mom and Jeff said I was an asshole. Mom said since dad bought it while they were married she also bought it and had every right to interfere with it.\n\nAITA here?\n\nETA: Just wanted to add that my original locket is set up where you can add little sections to it to add more photos. I just never chose to do that because I wanted it for the people I always considered my core family (or the people I was closest to). Part of me wants to remove mom now since this happened.", "created_utc": 1679825567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122ht7q/aita_for_telling_my_mom_and_her_husband_they_had/", "score": 4587, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're NTA, but your mother and stepfather sure are. I would go NC with them.", "NTA, replace all the photos with ones of you with your sister, brother, and dad, and go low contact or no contact and change the locks on your apartment.\n\nThese people clearly do not respect your boundaries.", "NTA and your living family are psychotic. I think I can say pretty confidently I don't know a single person who would fuck about with a kid's locket from their dead relative. Wtaf.", "NTA. I would have lost it on them - told them they deserved the \u201cheartbreak\u201d if they would be the type of people to sink  to this level. I would tell Jeff that a locket without him is not a misrepresentation of my family because he is not my family. Your mom chose to remarry. You had no say in it. In your place, I wouldn\u2019t even say stepdad anymore. He would now be \u201cmy egg donor\u2019s husband\u201d. Honestly, this is one of the few things where I would not hold back on my words.", "NTA. OMG.", "NTA\n\nThat was your personal property. They already knew that you didn't want to alter it in any way. They bought you the new locket knowing full well that you did not want it. They tried to force a relationship that just wasn't there, and that is a surefire way to never develop any kind of a positive relationship.\n\nWhat they were and are doing is way out of line. Maybe consider going LC/NC if you can. They are psychologically harming you and taking your personal possessions to try to force a fantasy that will (most definitely now) never exist.\n\nDon't feel guilty about taking your mother out of the locket. She hurt you, and you don't have to carry that reminder around with you.", "NTA. Why the hell so many parents try to force a relationship with the new family after a bio parent passes is something I will never understand.", "NTA - you can't just replace your dad and sister with a new family. if that locket was a special thing from your dad and you want to keep it exactly the way it was when he gave it to you, it's your decision to make. Your mom and stepdad are freaking nuts & it sounds like they've put some crazy ideas in your half/step siblings heads. I would take some time away from them.", "NTA. This made me tear up a little OP. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you never spoke to her again after this. Did you get your fathers picture back??", "NTA. Your mum has a lot of nerve and Jeff et. al are such mushrooms", "Big time NTA! \n\nMy father passed away when I was 9. When my mom broke the news to me, she gave me a heart shaped locket with a picture of my father inside. My parents separated when I was 6 and my mom got with my step dad, they had a son together about a year or so later. I love my step dad and my brother, they are most definitely my family. Never, not one time, did anyone even suggest I add anyone else's picture to the locket. As an adult with my own child (who I named after my father) I added my son's picture to the locket.", "NTA what a weird hill for your second family to die on. Maybe if they weren\u2019t such asses you\u2019d have wanted them to be in your locket.", "Nta  for op and the photo thiefs are ta\nI put pic of favorite pet instead of mom", "NTA.  OP if you\u2019re into body art, may I suggest you get a tattoo of your dads name, or something special that reminds you of him and proudly display it when you ever have to be around Jeff and mom again?", "NTA. It's a precious keepsake from someone who is no longer with us. I would be absolutely infuriated if someone messed with it.", "Not the asshole. They shouldn\u2019t have messed with your locket. They crossed the line, big time.", "That\u2019s such bullshit NTA", "NTA- Remove your mom.", "NTA. Like is this even a question? I wouldn\u2019t speak to your mom or sd anymore. I also wouldn\u2019t speak to the step sibling or new siblings either. They clearly don\u2019t respect you and think that they deserve precedence over your father and sister.", "NTA. Honestly, it feel like it\u2019s time to go no contact with them. They are emotionally manipulating you, and violating your privacy, your trust, and your personal belongings. \n\nActions have consequences.", "NTA that was wrong and disrespectful of them... mom has issues .... I  would  block them all ignore and cut  contact with mom and her husband... he knows if that was the other way around it would be a different story....\nI hope  u have other pics of your dad and sister", "NTA. The whole thing is just so fucking weird! I would go LC or NC with your mom. She has no boundaries and ick. The whole thing is just weird.", "NTA and I would never speak to my mother again if she had done something like that. I\u2019m so sorry, your mother is horrible and has essentially left you as an orphan.", "NTA....stay away from these people. Do not ever let them, or anyone sympathetic to them, near any of your property or person again. EVER.", "So, did mom and Jeff throw away the photos of dad and sister? Or did they have the photos set aside? \n\nNTA, hoping that the photos are still intact.", "NTA and I'd send mom her picture back and tell her to stay away from me forever. They've hounded you about this for YEARS. I can't even imagine.", "NTA.\n\nYou're keeping two of the closest people you've ever loved, and lost, close to your heart. The living are in your life every day, and should understand and ultimately RESPECT this sentiment.\n\nFor them to try and push their way into this locket which has \\*specific meaning\\* to you is highly inappropriate and as others have said, tantamount to abuse. \n\nI would demand the original picture back immediately.", "NTA and your mom doesn\u2019t love you. Go no contact", "NTA. It was a gift to you, therefore it belongs to you and you alone - your mother has no say so in what you do with it. She is being selfish and it wouldn't surprise me if she starts a campaign in the family to make you sound unreasonable.", "Nta. I hope you got to fix the locket the way you like it.", "NTA", "I never understand people jealous of dead people. Give back the locket with the others and tell them you can't trust them so you have to go no contact to protect yourself", "NTA, you have every right to your feelings on who is in your locket and on who your family is. Your mum and Jeff sound incredibly toxic. \n\nThat being said, I do think you are pushing away your step-brother and half-sisters and hurting them by not considering them real family. This is your prerogative, you do not have to love them, but they also have the right to feel hurt about this and point it out, just not to touch your things.", "NTA", "NTA x100000. Omg how inconsiderate. Your locket is so dear and special for a very real reason. They are horrible for even touching it without your permission.", "Absolutely NTA. What a horrible thing for your own mom to do! Then to say she technically helped buy it so she can do whatever she wants to it. Like, is she for real? That's messed up. What she and her husband did is maddening and only going to drive you away further (even though they won't see it like that).\n\nI'm sorry for your and your brother's loss OP. This is not okay for anyone to do and your reaction/feelings are valid.", "NTA\n\nFirst, my condolences. \nUnfortunately your mom and Jeff are selfish and insecure. You are not responsible for their feelings. \nI hope you receive some grief counseling, you\u2019ve been through a lot. I\u2019m grateful your brother is supportive.", "Their obsession and tampering with such a precious keepsake is wildly disrespectful and inappropriate. If that had happened to me, I\u2019d likely go NC and completely 86 those AH\u2019s from my life.", "Dear OP, you are NTA at all.  My father died when I was a little 5 year old girl, I\u2019m now 65.  My mom remarried when I was 8.  However, my step-father, wonderful or not, never replaced or trumped the deep feelings of love & longing I had, and still have for my natural father.  I\u2019ve always had a photo of him in my home & a few special treasures around.  I used to wonder if that was bothersome to my M & SF, and I sometimes felt awkward (guilty?) about it, but over time it became just normal.  Fortunately, it\u2019s been no big deal.  I would be so angry if I\u2019d ever been hassled about it!\n\nMy folks never tried to \u201cerase\u201d my father- in fact his art work is hung all over their house.  But my mom ALWAYS wanted me to feel my SF as my \u201cDad\u201d, and I simply never have.  The whole step child, step-family thing can be complicated.   I hope this helps.  NTA!", "Absolutely NTA. She broke your trust and stomped all over it. Her and Jeff are waaaaaaaaay the hell out of line.", "NTA. I recently went through some BS and my mom chose to side with my abuser. I removed her from my \"favorites\" list on my phone. Not very dramatic, but to me it makes a point. I'm a little bummed I don't really feel like I have a mother anymore, but honestly, she was never really there for me to begin with. I'm sorry, I hope you're able to get that little photo back, just thinking about it going missing makes me blood boil.", "If you feel the need to force someone to love you, you do not deserve that love. Period.", "NTA. Cut contact if they can\u2019t respect your wishes.", "This is extremely sad!", "NTA. You should return the favor by making them each a photo album that\u2019s just prints of this comment section and tying necklace chains around the book spines.", "NTA, don't ever see or speak to any of them again, seriously cut contact!! They don't deserve you!", "NTA\nThey had no right to touch your locket, interfere with how you honour the memory of your father and sister, or project their own insecurities onto a personal item of yours. What they did was inappropriate, invasive, and the absolutely best way to poison their relationship with you, possibly even permanently. You have my deepest sympathies for having to experience this and deal with this, and I hope you remain true to your boundaries and instincts.", "NTA\n\nI have zero sympathy for your mother in this situation, and I honestly support her removal from your locket. It was always clear the locket was an item of remembrance and as a 19 year old who lives separately from your mother she and your step-dad had no right to do this. It was manipulative and controlling, and it shows just how far your mother has fallen as a mother.\n\nAlso her line about, \"technically I bought it too\" is asinine. Clearly she's always been this underhanded, and you don't need that in your life.", "NTA. That\u2019s horrible they have disrespected the memory for your father and sister. Your family should have room for empathy for your loss, and not make it about them. They sound toxic. I\u2019m so sorry your going through that.", "NTA. This is flat out theft of personal property when it comes to taking your dad's photo out. I hope they gave it back! It's not like the law would charge them or anything, but it's still theft. \n\nAnd it's literally nauseating that these people are trying to force you to remove your late father and sister like that. Their total lack of honor and empathy is appalling.", "Great way for them to seal the deal of OP never even having a framed photograph of them anywhere she may be. NTA OP.", "NTA and you can take them to court.

I am sorry they have been harassing you for so long and finally violated your trust.  kt", "NTA. But your mom and this Jeff guy are supermassive assholes. Did you at least get your father's picture back or do you have another copy of it? Unless mom and Jeff apologize (and return the picture in case they have kept it) I would keep them at a distance. Some people's impertinence really knows no boundaries...", "NTA, your mom is grossly stomping on boundaries that should not even need to be set. Wtf", "NTA that locket is your equivalent of a necklace or bracelet that contains ashes of a deceased loved one. You clearly decided long ago that that locket was a memorial dedicated to your father and sister, a way for you to keep them with you at all times. Could you imagine if someone dumped out an urn of ashes that didn\u2019t belong to them so they could use it as a cookie jar? I know that\u2019s a crazy analogy but it fits here. They desecrated your memorial for your dead relatives. Im glad your brother is on your side.", "Remove mom. No actual mother would do that, she does not deserve a spot in that. Call me vindictive or petty, but if that happened I would no longer have a mother in my eyes. NTA. Someone, mom, moved on too quickly and I think she has guilt over it. Forcing you to accept the change is the only way she can bury that guilt is my guess. Who knows.", "OP better get that fucking photo back, is all I can say. I hate it when people disrespect others' keepsakes.", "NTA. OP, if they have a key to your place, change your locks. Maybe also go to their house and take down every picture that doesn't have you in it. Put it in the garage, or something.

I lost my mum and I wear her necklace all the time, I don\u2019t wear one my dad bought me regularly but he doesn\u2019t give a shit because he knows that I still have him and not my mum so it\u2019s completely different.\n\nThis is so creepy and abusive. I doubt you\u2019ll get it back OP, I\u2019m so sorry for this. As if they thought this would work?? NTA", "OP stated in a comment that she has a copy of the photo so she used it but she would rather have the original.", "It's a small to large (depending on style) charm on a necklace that can hold pictures, locks of hair etc. Most I have seen come in an oval or heart shape.", "NC and I\u2019d tell all my family members including her parents if they\u2019re still alive.

Grief hits people differently.", "NTA - I can\u2019t believe your mom, Jeff, etc are so insecure. You lost your dad very young. This locket is a tiny piece of him with you. This doesn\u2019t need to be a big deal for them. Sorry you had to go through this!", "Eh surprisingly common actually though it's more often that men do it than women. I'm a widow and I would say the majority of men in the community start another serious relationship within a year. Rarer with women because men view a woman with kids and no coparent differently.", "So your mom and/or Jeff snuck into your room while you were sleeping, stole your locket, tampered with it, snuck back into the room while you were still sleeping, and placed it back where they thought you had it?? That\u2019s really creepy in and of itself, IMO. \n\nHonestly, if my mother had done this, I don\u2019t think I could ever forgive her. She removed the photo of your dad (per your previous comment), the photo that he had chosen of himself and lovingly placed in the locket that was his gift to you. His fingerprints were on it. \n\nDo you know what happened to it? Did they throw it away or do they still have it?", "Make a copy of the copy just incase.

I would also wear shirts that included just a picture of him, you and your brother or just him and you.

That may be petty but that\u2019s what they deserve for being so insensitive.", "NTA, what a despicable thing for them to do.", "As the surviving parent of 3 children that lost their other parent, and all were minors at the time (the youngest was 3) - I absolutely can no fathom OP's mother's thought process here. \n\nWhile I personally waited 3 years to even make a foray into dating, and am now with an amazing man and have been for the last year - I'd lose my everlovingmind if he found this type of erasure of my kids' deceased parent okay. \n\nHe has no issue with the fact that we still have a few pictures of him around the house and there is still the last family photo (including his brother, sil and nephew) on the living room wall as well as his urn with a picture in a place that allows the kids access it.  \n\nWe don't live together, but when we do combine homes I don't think that will be an issue either, just as his kids would get to have pictures and momentos from their mother in the home (who is still alive). Tbh if I had an issue with that, or if he did - my expectation would be that we couldn't at the least, live together and at most not be able to be together. \n\nI really am just baffled by the insistence from the mother, but tbh, I think it goes back to the mom's own guilt of moving on so soon after her husband and child died unexpectedly.", "I was wondering where the photo went, too.", "This is disgusting behaviour on their part.  \n\nIf this happened to me I would tell them I\u2019m going no contact until they are ready to apologize and stop taking about your locket.", "Yeah I was frustrated about this. OP, please tell me you have it back!", "1. Suing would be dumb\n2. Police likely wouldn't do anything and even if  they would, would OP even want them to? I doubt it?\n3. Why should OP go ask a bunch of cops and know-nothings for legal advice?", "Just because your mum decided to move on with Jeff it doesn't give her the right to delete your dad from your memories and heart, whilst trying to force Jeff in! I absolutely hate it when blended families do this! If they where compassionate about you and your feelings by giving you space remember your dad, they wouldn't be in this situation.", ">This doesn\u2019t need to be a big deal for them.\n\nThis has to be no deal for them. It's absolutely not their business, which pictures OT has in this locket. Why do they care so much about it? If they would have acted the right way, maybe OT would have added them by herself. But if they act like this, I support OT to deny it to them.", "Don't forget the sister too. Everyone is talking about her dad and how quickly her mom moved on, but no one is talking about how OP's mom effectively tried to erase her daughter too.", "I think everyone should edit their responses to include\n\"Edit; and fuck jeff.\"", "It sounds like everyone was staying with the brother and did it while she slept.", "Why? The photo had sentimental value and was practically worthless in monetary value. The police wouldn't care about trying to solve it and it would just be a waste of their time to report it. Don't get me wrong, what Jeff and the mom did was awful, but in the eyes of the law, they're innocent. If anything, this advice would probably get OP in more trouble than her \"parents\" for filing a false report or wasting an officer's time. They would be the one hit with the fine on top of everything else.", "Did they take out your sister who had passed away? Seems like Jeff is a little threatened by your father, which is absolutely gross.

I guess you can't interfere with the justice boner using reason.", "Hear me out, the new guy is the long lost evil twin of OPs dad", "Right? I don't get it! Didn't they also love their previous partner? Especially if said partner was taken abruptly in an accident or by disease? If I were a stepparent I'd be more than happy to make sure the kids I \"inherited\" honoured their late parent and give them room to do so. Also, I'd let them warm up to me in their own time. If they didn't, eff it, as long as there was mutual respect.\n\nAll these people are just pushing their kids away", "Oh no!! Did you get the picture back? NTA OP.", "In a comment, she mentioned that she has a copy of the photo, but hasn't gotten the missing one back :(", "How old are you? Because I think you have completely disregarded the whole point of this post. It's NOT about the locket, but the emotional attachment to it and the fact that OP's mum and step dad are trying to erase parts of OP's family.\nWhat part of this did you not understand?????\n\nI truly hope your comment is based on naivety and you never have to suffer through emotional abuse at the hands of a supposed loved one.", "> advise\n\nAdvice", "Omg", "Omg I cannot imagine how they thought this was okay. They are disgusting humans. \n\nNTA", "I know I\u2019ll get downvoted for this but no, when you have kids you don\u2019t get to move on that quickly. It is not healthy for the kids and you don\u2019t know someone at all after a year. Seems like a great way to add a child predator into your home."]}
