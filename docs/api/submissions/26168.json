What's next after basic training? Could your husband be deployed at the same time as you ever? If so what's the plan?", "I'm a psychologist in my day job. And there's certainly a problem, if you don't do enough preparation before leaving. And by 'preparation', I mean the children need to be very securely attached, to whoever their caregiver will be (whilst you're away). They need to spend a lot of time beforehand, i.e. over the course of preferably months, with that caregiver. \n\nOtherwise they are at high risk of damage. I'll get crucified for that observation - because this is a post that's going to touch on people's reflex, to support working mothers (and I absolutely support working parents of any gender, btw). But gender of parent doesn't matter here. Children that age DO generally suffer damage regardless, if they're completely separated from the main caregiver for that length of time. \n\nSure, some parents do it anyway. And plenty of children are inadvertently harmed, as a result. That's just a psychological reality, demonstrated by copious research - even if the messengers of that, are often shot.\nThe first 5 years (and especially the first 2), are the most important for personality formation in young children. They are highly vulnerable to events around them, during that time. \n\nThe main caregiver suddenly 'disappearing' in that period (for such a length of time), DOES usually result in abandonment/insecurity issues when the child grows up. Don't fall for the self-comforting justifications you will encounter, from parents who do leave very young children that length of time. Do your own child psychology research for yourself, and learn the facts and realities. That's the best way to make the best decisions for your children's wellbeing.\n\nAs I said, there are ways of doing it, if the child is cared for by other people they are strongly attached to. But please do be aware, the children ARE at risk of psychological damage (without enough preparation), regardless of the financial benefits of you working.", "You are going to be a dual military family.\n\nThat is exceptionally rough.\n\nYou have not said anything about branch, schools, or deployments. There is *a lot* of missing information.", "When I was a small child my dad used to regularly go away on ships trials (he was responsible for all the pipework on board) and apparently  I cried an ocean.  When he wrote to my mum  he always included drawings for me of the ship with stick.men. and pictures of him walking awayv from the ship , then a train and then a drawing of a house and a lady and a little girl so i knew he was coming home. These situations can be made to work but you have to.put effort into.it.

I used to being a daddy's girl apparently but when I was 3yo he went away for around 3 to 6months. When he came back, I wouldn't acknowledge him and it lead to a massive break in our relationship up until I was 20, when my mom died of cancer. When I was a child I would randomly cry for no reason, and cry harder when my mom would tell me he needed to go again ; and when I was a teenager we would fight a lot because I wouldn't acknowledge his authority as a parent and/or would ignore him. I was angry at him for coming back home. I would say that intellectually I knew it wasn't his fault, that it was because of his job, but emotionally I just couldn't build a relationship with him. This whole thing made me depressed at 12, with I suspect even earlier signs. Young children may not understand everything, but they do feel things. I'd say take the top comment into consideration. For me it turned out not great. We are now back at being father and daughter but it's only probably because my mom died.", "I'm going to be downvoted and crucified by the \"pro-military\" mob here, but ESH (you and your husband).\n\nYou made a choice that you always wanted to join the military. You married a man in the military. When childless, that was fair enough and understandable.\n\nBut then you both chose to bring innocent children into the mix. Children need, for their own development and healthy relationships, the presence of at least one caregiver. Whilst yes, there are working parents out there, typically they spend a few hours a day at work, then come home and spend time with the child(ren). Children know that their caregiver will be home at some point in the day so do not have abandonment issues. Military careers involve training away from home, deployments for a number of months away, and less presence with their kids. The occasional phone call isn't going to cut it. Nor is a visit back home for a couple of days, resulting in leaving the child(ren) yet again and breaking their hearts again.\n\nYou and your husband have been trying to \"have it all\", without thinking of the impact on your kids. You should've been thinking of this before having children in the first place and decided that either you both join the military and refrain from having kids at this point in your lives, or (now the kids actually exist), only have one military parent so the other parent can be a constant presence in their lives.  Additionally, military families tend to move often. Not only will your kids not have their parents' presence in their lives, but you're also depriving them of living close to other family members, and from building meaningful friendships at school because they are having to pick up and leave frequently.\n\nPlease don't do this to your children. Fight the battles nearer to home first and foremost.", "Please do not take advice from Reddit on a child\u2019s development. Do the research.

The military can wait.", "Why the rush?\n\nYou are very young and I'm wondering if, as well as your other reasons, you simply want to spread your wings and have some time for your own personal development.\n\nIn my opinion this is not the time. If this was an actual plan - to have two children and then disappear for long periods I do not understand you at all.\n\nIt's not about what sex you are. If you are breastfeeding as you suggest by your weaning reference, then you have had a close relationship with your one year old. How on earth do you think that child will cope. It will be as though you have died. And death of a parent is one of the worst things that can happen to an infant. They cannot understand and they cannot verbalise.\n\nYTA\n\nAs I see it now I was an AH for pursuing a demanding training course of 18months when my child was very young. I did not live away but it was a huge change for the child.  At the time, I really wanted to get it done. I was in a rush. But looking back it was extremely detrimental to us all.

She's inseparable with my mother.\nWhile I was away, she was taken care of by my husband, and my parents on week ends so he could have some time to rest. Nothing changed, the routine was the same. \nLittle trick (given by the psychologist):\nWe put a visual calendar on her room's wall with little stickers to put on the date every night: red if mommy is away, green if she's here. We started 2 weeks before my departure, asking: is mommy here tonight?? \nThen chose the color accordingly. It helped her with the time and with seeing how many days before I come back.\nWe also talked to her before I went away and we prepared her.\nSo she's fine and its clearly, in my opinion, doable.\nThe psychologist told me to avoid leaving during the the 8-12 months age because that's when the attachment issues can be the strongest, and that's where the abandonment anxiety appears.\nBut yes, the child Indeed needs to be with strong attachment figures.

Especially after the divorce as my mom stayed in the state with family but he was often states away.   One parent in the military is enough.

Did you? Please, point it out.", "Not any crazier than some countries having forced conspriction. Had a buddy in high school that was a duel citizen and had to go back to his other country at 18 to serve for 2yrs. At least in this we have a choice.", "No crazier than South Korea having 2 years mandatory military service (male citizens only)", "Did you not have JROTC at your high school?", "A point of clarification for my southern neighbours, they aren't choosing the military instead of school or work, they're choosing the military as a way to access school and a desirable field of work.", "From what I see it is around 18 for the EU countries but to be honest my sources is the a list of enlistment age by country on wiki which might not be reliable but it does show 18 for most countries\n\n\nI agree that it's not common for young people to join I just mean it's common for young people to be allowed. \n\nBut definitely agree military service for America versus a lot of EU countries is different and there is a lot more American military activity going on in the world.", "I\u2019d argue it\u2019s really no different from picking a college to attend really. It\u2019s an option that\u2019s out there and the majority of people are vastly uninformed about the military. They have this singular mindset that your only job is to kill people, when in reality, most of the jobs are non-combat roles that you can easily hold in the civilian world with experience.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of people do join because they\u2019re poor or just want free education and recruiters have to meet a quota so they use that to their advantage, but in my experience, the majority volunteered for other reasons. The system could definitely be improved, but you need to also look at the target demographic. Fresh out of high school kids are the more lucrative option because they\u2019re blank slates for just about everything. Working post-high school isn\u2019t really an option without experience or education in the U.S. if you want a livable wage for most people either.", "True but I think part of it is the cost of education in the US, it can be considerably higher so getting access to qualifications in the military with little cost is probably a big selling point", "You can leave school in UK and Ireland at 16/17\n\nYou not knowing something doesn't make it not true..

I wasn't even a thought when all this started.  Want to blame someone? Might want to start with older countries that have destabilized nations and people long before the United States was established.  Call me sweetheart or whatever you want but it really doesn't change the facts, just makes you feel superior for some reason. I'm going to assume it's an ignorant male liberal superior but if not it doesn't matter, your lack of education isn't my problem, especially since it seems you live, thankfully, in another country.  So, with that being said im off to bed.

This is only for defense inside the country though, only the professional military gets deployed abroad.\nAlso, less than 20% actually gets conscripted, which means that they in general choose the ones that are motivated and really wants to.\n\nEdit: nobody has to go to be able to study, though, as higher education is free.", "South Korea is in a State of active war. i would have a mandatory 2 years( or longer) in my country as well if i had no treaty with my neighbors.\n\nedit: especially if the neighbor is one of the crazy idiots (putin/kim/xi/iranian extrimist guy/taliban, you name them)", "Yep, same amount of crazy", "Israel would like to have a word", "No we did not", "we didn\u2019t have that, and i just looked because i was curious-only 9 high schools in my state have that.", "They also have huge divorce rates and domestic violence rates.

Its argued the US functions the way it does (first world country lacking universal benefits other first world countries have) for this very reason- keep them poor. Poor people are more willing to pick up the grunt work.", "It is a choice. But the choice is \u2018would you rather stay here working dead end insecure jobs and not even be able to pay your rent or medical bills, or would you rather join the army and risk being splattered around a field when you step on a landmine\u2026 or possibly living and having PTSD for life.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat like \u2018would you rather I cut off your left or right ear?\u2019\u2026. It is *technically* a choice, just not one with any good options! \n\nI can see why the unknown and potential excitement of the Army combined with training that may give you a vocation for life, no bills to pay (if you live in army accommodation or are on tour\u2026 I assume anyway!) and access to a far greater standard of medical care than someone on the breadline will be able to access (even in the UK where we have the NHS, I get the impression that the medical services that are provided for injured service people is in a different league - they can get prosthetic arms or legs or wheelchairs that the NHS would never in a million years fund for example). \n\nIn the U.K. the TV adverts are either pitched like real life call of duty, or like an advert for an adventure holiday travel company. Either way they\u2019re clearly pitched at young (mostly) men and it\u2019s sold as an exciting adventure that will propel you out of the predictable monotony of your life. I find the tactics they use for those adverts absolutely disgraceful - from the point of view of the people in charge of marketing yeah it\u2019s very smart. But to me it feels completely unethical to try and imply to naive 18 year olds with few prospects that joining the army will be like their favourite video game or a backpacking holiday. The one they have at the moment has a bunch of submariners going for a quick surprise swim off the edge of the sub they\u2019ve brought up\u2026 which feels like an unlikely activity to me, but I wouldn\u2019t have anything to back that up to be fair. The visual language of the ad is absolutely intended to link it to the visual language of adventure holidays though, where people are jumping off of cliffs in to blue seas below type thing. It\u2019s just completely disingenuous.\n\nSadly I can see why the idea of this lifestyle ultimately feels like the better \u2018choice\u2019 compared to standing behind a cash register all day, smiling at rude customers, never having enough money to buy a house or start a family, with minimal protections, holiday, benefits, onward prospects or (in America) decent health cover.", "It's still better than the government telling me I have to join the army, rather than I can join the army for benefits.", "A small number of people see it as the only option.
