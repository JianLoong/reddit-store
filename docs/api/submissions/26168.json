What's next after basic training? Could your husband be deployed at the same time as you ever? If so what's the plan?", "I'm a psychologist in my day job. And there's certainly a problem, if you don't do enough preparation before leaving. And by 'preparation', I mean the children need to be very securely attached, to whoever their caregiver will be (whilst you're away). They need to spend a lot of time beforehand, i.e. over the course of preferably months, with that caregiver. \n\nOtherwise they are at high risk of damage. I'll get crucified for that observation - because this is a post that's going to touch on people's reflex, to support working mothers (and I absolutely support working parents of any gender, btw). But gender of parent doesn't matter here. Children that age DO generally suffer damage regardless, if they're completely separated from the main caregiver for that length of time. \n\nSure, some parents do it anyway. And plenty of children are inadvertently harmed, as a result. That's just a psychological reality, demonstrated by copious research - even if the messengers of that, are often shot.\nThe first 5 years (and especially the first 2), are the most important for personality formation in young children. They are highly vulnerable to events around them, during that time. \n\nThe main caregiver suddenly 'disappearing' in that period (for such a length of time), DOES usually result in abandonment/insecurity issues when the child grows up. Don't fall for the self-comforting justifications you will encounter, from parents who do leave very young children that length of time. Do your own child psychology research for yourself, and learn the facts and realities. That's the best way to make the best decisions for your children's wellbeing.\n\nAs I said, there are ways of doing it, if the child is cared for by other people they are strongly attached to. But please do be aware, the children ARE at risk of psychological damage (without enough preparation), regardless of the financial benefits of you working.", "You are going to be a dual military family.\n\nThat is exceptionally rough.\n\nYou have not said anything about branch, schools, or deployments. There is *a lot* of missing information.", "When I was a small child my dad used to regularly go away on ships trials (he was responsible for all the pipework on board) and apparently  I cried an ocean.  When he wrote to my mum  he always included drawings for me of the ship with stick.men. and pictures of him walking awayv from the ship , then a train and then a drawing of a house and a lady and a little girl so i knew he was coming home. These situations can be made to work but you have to.put effort into.it. I am almost 69 and I still have many of these drawings and they still let me know how much he thought and cared .", "My father was in the military. I used to being a daddy's girl apparently but when I was 3yo he went away for around 3 to 6months. When he came back, I wouldn't acknowledge him and it lead to a massive break in our relationship up until I was 20, when my mom died of cancer. When I was a child I would randomly cry for no reason, and cry harder when my mom would tell me he needed to go again ; and when I was a teenager we would fight a lot because I wouldn't acknowledge his authority as a parent and/or would ignore him. I was angry at him for coming back home. I would say that intellectually I knew it wasn't his fault, that it was because of his job, but emotionally I just couldn't build a relationship with him. This whole thing made me depressed at 12, with I suspect even earlier signs. Young children may not understand everything, but they do feel things. I'd say take the top comment into consideration. For me it turned out not great. We are now back at being father and daughter but it's only probably because my mom died.", "I'm going to be downvoted and crucified by the \"pro-military\" mob here, but ESH (you and your husband).\n\nYou made a choice that you always wanted to join the military. You married a man in the military. When childless, that was fair enough and understandable.\n\nBut then you both chose to bring innocent children into the mix. Children need, for their own development and healthy relationships, the presence of at least one caregiver. Whilst yes, there are working parents out there, typically they spend a few hours a day at work, then come home and spend time with the child(ren). Children know that their caregiver will be home at some point in the day so do not have abandonment issues. Military careers involve training away from home, deployments for a number of months away, and less presence with their kids. The occasional phone call isn't going to cut it. Nor is a visit back home for a couple of days, resulting in leaving the child(ren) yet again and breaking their hearts again.\n\nYou and your husband have been trying to \"have it all\", without thinking of the impact on your kids. You should've been thinking of this before having children in the first place and decided that either you both join the military and refrain from having kids at this point in your lives, or (now the kids actually exist), only have one military parent so the other parent can be a constant presence in their lives.  Additionally, military families tend to move often. Not only will your kids not have their parents' presence in their lives, but you're also depriving them of living close to other family members, and from building meaningful friendships at school because they are having to pick up and leave frequently.\n\nPlease don't do this to your children. Fight the battles nearer to home first and foremost.", "Please do not take advice from Reddit on a child\u2019s development. Do the research. You will see just how devastating the impacts of leaving your children at this age can be.\n\nEdited to add: when I commented this, there was only one other comment that didn\u2019t say something along the lines of \u201cyou do you girl, your kid will be fine\u201d.

The military can wait.", "Why the rush?\n\nYou are very young and I'm wondering if, as well as your other reasons, you simply want to spread your wings and have some time for your own personal development.\n\nIn my opinion this is not the time. If this was an actual plan - to have two children and then disappear for long periods I do not understand you at all.\n\nIt's not about what sex you are. If you are breastfeeding as you suggest by your weaning reference, then you have had a close relationship with your one year old. How on earth do you think that child will cope. It will be as though you have died. And death of a parent is one of the worst things that can happen to an infant. They cannot understand and they cannot verbalise.\n\nYTA\n\nAs I see it now I was an AH for pursuing a demanding training course of 18months when my child was very young. I did not live away but it was a huge change for the child.  At the time, I really wanted to get it done. I was in a rush. But looking back it was extremely detrimental to us all. I can never have that time back and neither can the child. I can never make it right.", "Honestly? This isn't popular at all but I agree with the expert's opinion at the top.

She's strongly attached to him and he cares for her as often as me.\n-My parents live 20 minutes away and she stays with them once a week since birth. She's inseparable with my mother.\nWhile I was away, she was taken care of by my husband, and my parents on week ends so he could have some time to rest. Nothing changed, the routine was the same. \nLittle trick (given by the psychologist):\nWe put a visual calendar on her room's wall with little stickers to put on the date every night: red if mommy is away, green if she's here. We started 2 weeks before my departure, asking: is mommy here tonight?? \nThen chose the color accordingly. It helped her with the time and with seeing how many days before I come back.\nWe also talked to her before I went away and we prepared her.\nSo she's fine and its clearly, in my opinion, doable.\nThe psychologist told me to avoid leaving during the the 8-12 months age because that's when the attachment issues can be the strongest, and that's where the abandonment anxiety appears.\nBut yes, the child Indeed needs to be with strong attachment figures.

Especially after the divorce as my mom stayed in the state with family but he was often states away.   One parent in the military is enough.

If you decide to go that path now dad needs to start being primary care giver. I think you are underestimating how hard this will be on you.

Also why be in the military anyway?", "Yes. YTA", "I remember a call to Dr. Laura one time. The lady said she was joining the military because she wanted to do what was best for her kids. Dr. Laura said, how is being away from your kids doing what\u2019s best for them?!?!", "I don't think you're necessary an asshole, but you're not just going away for basic training. In the military you're required to regularly go away for months at a time, regardless of whether you have kids or not. From a military kid, it fucking sucked and my relationship with my parents has only become good in adulthood. You'll also have to move around frequently, which again absolutely fuckin sucks ass. Non combat roles are still deployed all over the world.

I can\u2019t even imagine both parents being active duty.\n\nChoosing the Coast Guard was the best option for us, never having to leave the states unless we chose to. We were very particular about which stations/jobs we put for our transfer requests and we were pretty lucky to get relocated to a top 5 pick each transfer. The longest my husband ever had to be away was a month, and that was just twice a year for the four years we were stationed there. Even being as particular as we were, life was incredibly difficult for my whole family. \n\nAs far as college goes, we have recently learned that because my husband did 20 years and has retired this summer with 100% p&t, our children will all get free college in a small handful of states as long as we meet the residency requirements. In addition to that, I recommend looking into chapter 35 for more college benefits. My husband initially transferred the G.I. to our children, but with the free VA college tuition and the chapter 35 they are all set so he was able to transfer the G.I. back to himself.", "USA....

What will your MOS be?  If you are only joining the military for the GI bill for your kids, I wouldn\u2019t do it. Your kids may not even go to college.  Maybe your kids will want to join the military.  Or maybe they will realize they can make much more money in trades then going to college. If it is because that\u2019s your dream or career goal, then I am sure you can find a way to make it work.  It seems like you will only be away from the kids for 8 weeks\u2026although I agree with others that it does seem like the kids are a bit young.  Is your 1 year old walking? Saying words?  Who will be watching the kids while your husband is at work?  If it\u2019s family members and you have that support, along with a lot of prep it could work, but ultimately you have to do what\u2019s best for you and your family.  Eight weeks is not forever.

You may want to think about just working part time or going to school while your kids are little.  Maybe nursing school? You can do the pre requisites at community colleges.  Nursing pays well and has more fluid hours. Part time or per diem, etc.  I personally wouldn\u2019t get myself into a situation that I couldn\u2019t change if my kids didn\u2019t adjust well.\n\nEdited for typo and to say NTA, but I would consider other choices that give you more flexibility with your kids.", "A better solution may be to have your husband transfer his gi bill to you so that you can get a degree.

As a mother of three kids who was (retired after serving 21 yrs) in the military (Air Force), I NEVER felt like I was an asshole.\n\nBoth my husband and I were in the military, I was active duty the entire time. He was active duty and then went reserve. He was a cop and I was admin. So you may not be in a combat career field, but you can deploy. We both deployed and went TDY for work or schooling many times between the both of us. Air Force deployments are typically 6 months, but my longest deployment was 10 months long. At the time my youngest son was 13 months, my daughter was 2 yrs, and the oldest son was 4. They were fine. We did at least weekly video chats sometimes more. I had a build a bear for each kid that said a little phrase, and they used it when they missed me. My husband gave me daily updates, so when I did call, I had something to talk about.\n\nAll I can tell you as a mother who left their children behind many times, the below is what I did off the top of my head. \n1. Be present when you are home. I was always with the kids and gave 100% when I was home. Since I went TDY a lot, I felt like a crap mother, but I spent time with my kids, on the floor playing cars, Legos, and Barbies. They loved the park, I didn't sit on the bench like most parents, I was going down the slide and doing money bars. There are parents who are home every day and are not present for their kids, and I feel like that's worse.\n2. Take family trips. They bring you closers. It doesn't have to be elaborate. A camping trip is fine. We did lots of \"staycations\" as a family. \n3. Find a routine. Having a routine will make parenting easier. When a parent is gone, their daily life hasn't changed because of your routine. \n4. Find your \"military family\". Having trusting co-workers/friends who can take your kiddos if you need help or someone to watch them at a moments notice. \n5. Include your kids. Have them do research of where you are going if you were to deploy. Have conversations on the environment, why you are going, length, etc.  If you are moving, have them research the area and then find fun places to visit.\n6. Keep them active. Find a sport, scouts, base/post youth center, or clubs. That way, they will make friends, and they may find kids in similar situations.\n7. Same parenting styles. You and your spouse need to be on the same page as parenting/discipline goes. \n\nMy kids are now 17, 18, and 20. Being a military child can be hard, but you can give them tools to be productive and resilient leaders. My 20 y/o joined the Reserves, and my youngest is thinking about joining as well. \n\nAnd for those people who say you are the a-hole; people like you SUCK. Good parents and MOTHERS can be in the military. My parenting skills have nothing to do with my job. It's how I am when I am home and the environment I raise them in. There are times I felt like a crap parent because of people like you.

He does not have any abandonment/insecurity issues from this.\n\nThe reason this happened is because his two month old sister almost died. As in \u201cwe picked out the gravesite\u201d almost died. While he was in the apartment, btw. We spent the next six months at the hospital and care homes, then moving in under 3 weeks so we could bring her home. \n\nMy son did suffer trauma from watching his sister almost die. He was terrified of ambulances for a months. He is very protective of his other sisters and far more tolerant of them than most nine year olds could be expected to be. He understands, and has from that day, what death is.\n\nHe was fine being away from us though. We were careful to call him every day, to let him know we loved him, and took him out for his birthday as soon as his sister was stable and we weren\u2019t on deathbed vigil anymore. We did visit him several times over those months and his grandparents made sure to spend lots of time with him. He was very aware that we hadn\u2019t abandoned him and that we\u2019d be together again once the emergency was over. And my older cousins made sure to coddle him and he adored my aunt\u2019s youngest, who was like a brother to him.

She had her Nana, her older brother at home & her older sister across the street.  She did not go to school that week.  She did not shower.  She ate a few meals.  She called me constantly.  She didn\u2019t even really know what was wrong with her except she needed me to come home.  That was my last business trip for that job.  \n\nShe is fine now.  She did address this with her therapist.  The only time this comes out now is when she is sick, she has a struggle with me walking out of the room. \n\n6 days of not having her primary caregiver & her secondary one & even though she had dad & aunt, it was not enough for her.  Maybe 6 months, the last time she was sick, that feeling of being abandoned & losing everything came back & she needed reassurance from me & this is with professional help.", "I'm not going to call OP an asshole, and I do want to support working mothers. But I grew up with my father gone most of the time. I'd see him when he was home from work trips. But I grew up with just my mom, and to a degree id must have preferred he had done something different, was home more, and we just didn't have as many material rhinfs", "My sister left her son at a yr old to go to basic. He was later diagnosed with RADD and as a preteen had to basically be attached at the hip for a length of time with my sister in an attempt for them to bind properly. OP is an AH for having kids before going into the military instead of after and being settled.(OP stated this was the plan since before marriage)", "I just want to say that while I agree about the idea of being very thoughtful and doing a lot of preparation in this next year due to the risks of attachment wounding should you decide to move forward, a lot of the people in these comments need to check themselves. This isn\u2019t directed at NoSurprise82, as their response was quite measured, but rather everyone else making a lot of assumptions and accusations in the comments. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m a therapist who practices from an attachment-informed lens and I do a lot of work with people who have childhood trauma and attachment wounds. I\u2019m also a huge feminist and I think it\u2019s vital to keep in mind socioeconomic considerations. I can say that there is a lot of sexism and classism going on here. \n\nFact is for anyone who is blindly accusing this woman of abandonment - if you think this is fucked up but that having two full-time working parents is totally attachment trauma risk-free, you\u2019re kidding yourself. We live in a world that essentially demands two working parents in order to be remotely financially secure. And that\u2019s fucked. We typically have a primary attachment figure in securely attached toddlers/kids and that tends to be the mother, because we live in a society that typically demands it of them. Studies show that even in dual income households women tend to do more domestic labor. Ideally, we would be living in a world where labor exploitation was not demanded, where living off of a single income which is held equally by any gender, or two part time incomes, would be possible, and that way kids could actually have secure attachment. But that isn\u2019t happening anyway where in the US we are forced to send our kids to daycares at 6 weeks old for 8-12 hours a day anyway. I worked in daycares when I was younger and trust me, secure attachment isn\u2019t their speciality. So take a step back and then think about the complexity informing this person\u2019s decisions. \n\nThis is a mom who is trying to do her best with limited resources, to try to give her kids (and maybe herself, god forbid) a better future. There is no going back that she had kids young, so best to remove judgement about that now - it happens all the time, especially amongst people with certain lived experiences. The military often appeals to folks with poor economic outlook because it offers security of income, benefits, and a structured career path. In my anecdotal experience, it can also appeal to people who have their own disrupted attachment and are seeking an authority figure. We ought to praise this mom for considering the ramifications of leaving for two months. Because that\u2019s a whole lot more than most kids get at all. Most of the time, in this country, we don\u2019t even get to pause and think about how our forced relationship with work is damaging our kids. \n\nLastly, for what it\u2019s worth, there are a whole lot of other things beyond the obvious cases of abuse that damage a child. Financially insecurity can be one of them. Stressed parents, conflict in the home, parents who lash out at kids, parents who are hot and cold with their kids, parents who don\u2019t know how to regulate their own emotions, blaming children for circumstances outside of their control, physical punishment of any kind, even moderately irresponsible drinking or substance use, incarceration, negative interactions with law enforcement/system-involvement, uninvolved/disinterested parents, favoring one child over the other, and in my opinion most importantly and easily stated - the child feeling unwanted, a burden, or unloved. Just a few examples of things I see every week. There are plenty more! Repetition of these damaging behaviors/attitudes are probably going to damage a kid more than the situation the OOP is describing, if she AND her husband can be mindful about their preparation and attachment over the next year. The good news is, as therapists we also use the term \u201cgood enough\u201d parenting, and it\u2019s totally possible to fuck up sometimes and not totally fuck up your kid. This is a nuanced situation, as is everything with parenting, and it\u2019s best to keep that in mind.", "You keep repeating that it will cause damage, then at the end you say, \u201cwithout preparation.\u201d\n\nWhat specific preparation do you mean? \n\nThat information would be a lot more helpful than just saying that without preparation, these children will be irreparably damaged, forever and ever, amen.", "Hmmm, as someone who was handed off to a family friend to be cared for whilst my main caregiver was hospitalised (despite other family members I was attached to being around), where could I find out more about the affects of this and how to recognise/deal with them as an adult?\n\nI will also google but will be grateful if anyone who's already looked into it would like to share anything they've found useful!", "Is having parents with jobs (working 8hrs a day, 5 days a week) also potentially harming for a child under 2 and/or 5 years old?

Now teen mom is home with the baby, no way to get a job because childcare is unaffordable and they live in an area with limited job opportunities, and what\u2019s available is backbreaking and/or minimum wage. So as the babies stop coming and start growing, mom looks for her way out of the last few years of endless crying and diapers and no adult contact.

But being dual military with children is an incredibly difficult situation. It is a guarantee that there will be times where neither parent is home for their children and they\u2019ll need to have a backup plan where someone else will be available to watch the kids for potentially months at a time. The military does not give you a stable life. Even with dogs I sometimes had problems. There was one time I found out on a Friday that I had to go out of town on a Sunday.

You can save a lot of money grocery shopping at the commissary and BX (base exchange), and you have access to WIC and other family programs if you need them.

VA benefits and military discounts in the local area can extend past one's enlistment. I had injuries and illnesses while I was on active duty, and the VA stepped up for me later in life.
