You want someone who has been 'your person's to walk you down the aisle instead of the family member whose relationship with you has always been strained at best. That's completely understandable. \n\nNote- while I absolutely think you should have the person *you* want walking down the aisle, whomever that is, you should be aware of the potential fallout. If your parents are contributing money to your wedding, they may decide not to. Your relationship with your dad and/or mom might get worse. I'm not trying to discourage you in any way, but I think you should be prepared for what might happen next.", "INFO: Are your parents paying for the wedding at all? As much as it sucks, if they're contributing then everything changes", "NTA - You are doing best with the tools you were given. If your father wanted a daughter to walk down the aisle then he should have ACTED like a dad to you. It is your wedding but you do need to be aware that actions have their consequences and you should be aware that you may loosing things and people over your choices. You are the only one who can judge if your people are with keeping. It\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s pain and emotion there with your parents and THAT should be delt with ASAP via a talk with you three or a therapist involved.", "NTA\n\nNo one is entitled to certain roles in your wedding, even if severely outdated traditions of giving away women like property exist. My son walked me down the aisle to his new step father.", "NTA. \nIt's your wedding and if that's what you want then he can eat shit. Your parents sound like they blow and I can totally understand not wanting your dad to walk you down the aisle. My dad won't be walking me down either. I'm sure that when you look back on pictures of your friend walking you down the aisle instead you'll be glad you chose to do it that way.", "If you had such a bad relationship with your parents...why are you even talking to them at all, let alone about a wedding? It is tradition that the father walks their daughter down the aisle, and it seems like you ambushed him with the fact that he sure ain't going to be doing that.\n\nI can't judge on whatever experience you had as a child, but in this particular situation I'm going to say YTA.", "NTA. Have a lovely day.", "Girl, do as you wish. Your wedding, your rules (to some extent). You know what me and my wife did? We both walked ourselfs down the ile. So hard NTA", "NTA, it is your wedding and the day is about you and your husband and not your parents.\n\nThe only solution i can propose is, since you have 2 hands/sides, that they both walk you down, if that is something you would want.\n\nBut be firm on your wishes, the day is about you. Also congrats on the wedding", "YTA, not for your choices about who to walk you down the aisle but for continuing to have something like your father in your life at all. Dump the 'rents and your life will improve greatly.", "NTA: Yay you for telling you father why you don't want him to walk you down the aisle.\n\nYou survived and it sounds like Lucy was a big help with that. What a lovely way to honor your friendship with her?\n\nDon't let him or anyone else bully you into changing your mind. Hope it's a wonderful day.", "NTA. I\u2019m not even telling my parents when I get married. \nThey made my last engagement a living hell and at the end of it, kinda helped ruin the entire experience. They wanted it their way, as always. No matter what I or my (now ex) fianc\u00e9 wanted. The relationship ended for other reasons, \nBut I decided if I ever do get married they aren\u2019t invited and I\u2019m just eloping and sending out cards after to avoid the drama.\n\nAnyways. It\u2019s your day! Do what YOU and your fianc\u00e9 want. Not anyone else.", "NTA. Your wedding, your decision. Your parents need to rethink their parenting if they want to be a significant part of your life going forward.", "NTA if what you said to your father is true then he\u2019s got to deal with these consequences of his actions, and it doesn\u2019t even sound like it\u2019s about him but about celebrating your relationship with your friend. He isn\u2019t entitled to walk you down the isle no one js", "NTA. I love the idea of normalizing having a friend or loved one walking you down the aisle!\n>\nNot only is it more special and meaningful for you, but it rids the stigma that a father is to \u201cgive away\u201d a woman to another man, like property. \n>\nYour father is not owed this role. He has not earned it.", "NTA, I had a similar upbringing. Family is who you choose and respect is earned not given simply because they\u2019re your parents. I hope you have a fantastic wedding", "NTA. Anyone can walk you down the aisle or there could be no one just because it\u2019s tradition that the father does it you don\u2019t have to do that, your wedding do whatever makes you happy.", "No, me and my fiance are paying everything.", "I was thinking about family therapy! Only if they agree, which i find kinda hard tho", "What tradition is that? That the father \"owns\" the daughter and \"gives\" her to another man who then \"takes over the ownership\"? Not all traditions deserve a place in today's society. And the woman should be the one to decide who (if anyone) gets to perform this role. At my (F) wedding, nobody \"gave\" me away. We were two independent adults choosing to enter a legal, moral and social agreement. Everyone else was a guest, invited to enjoy the moment with us, but not entitled to anything other than a nice meal and party.", "I talk to them because, when i left their house, i started therapy. And i learned a lot with my therapist, like forgive them for not being nice parents, cause no one is born knowing how to raise a child; but i still remember all i went through because of them, but i decided to still talk to them and have Contact to be in peace with myself.", "How come parents don\u2019t HAVE to act like adults and parents to their children?  You expect the now adult child to have a good relationship that the parents never fostered in the first place? That\u2019s not how that works, relationships and bridges and take both ends to maintain and better. As a parent you aren\u2019t owed anything to your role, you raise a child and hope for the best.", "Thank you so much! Ill have a lot of time to think anyhow...", "Im so sorry about that :(. No one should never let their parents take over their life as adults", "i always disliked thosd stigmas and i realized that of she was okay with it, i could totally do it! But even if its his dream, he doesnt deserve it.", "NTA then\n\nYour wedding, your rules", "That\u2019s fair! Even with me going and my family seeing the positives, it can be really hard for them to concede that therapy works. I found that just me going can be enough. Understanding your hurt and your parents hurt is very mind blowing. My mothers and i relationship skyrocketed after she apologized for the things in my childhood that she did/didn\u2019t remember and when I came to realize the pressures my mother was under. We now thrive and that woman is my best friend.", "I understand, my father I have very loose ties to: He's done some messed up stuff. My sister flat out won't speak to him at all anymore. I only communicate through phone calls.\n\nThat said don't ever feel forced you *have* to keep ties with them. As an adult that is your choice to make. The reason I got to my conclusion is that it seems like you contacted them to set them up for a disappointing fall.\n\nSometimes bridges are better left burnt.", "...Huh? \n\nThat has nothing to do with the OP. Again I'm not focusing on what abuse the OP did or did not go through: This is purely about the wedding and ambushing the father (that she's for some reason talking to despite said abuse) with the fact that he's not walking her down the aisle.\n\nIt's her wedding, she can do whatever she wishes with it. I just don't know why she's talking to her parents at all, let alone discussing the wedding with them.", "Glad i could help a little", "I don\u2019t understand this \u201cambushing of the father\u201d and to be fair even if the relationship is a strained one it still one the Op is attempting to value. Op answered the dads comment to stop all the expectations of walking down the aisle. The ambushing was more of an education about how the wedding is to actually happen. The fact her father took it so harsh is his issue and it\u2019s okay to want your life givers to be at the wedding.", "I don't think she valued it too much when she went on her tirade against the parents.\n\nIt just doesn't sound like it was discussed with them at all until that moment and telling your father he ain't going anywhere near that aisle is a bit of a bombshell. The mother doesn't sound like she was involved at all until she was called.\n\nIt just seems to me that she was talking to them purely to spite them. That's why I'm sticking to my guns here.", "And that\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not trying to be rude or disrespectful at all. I can understand the Op though. Wanting a relationship with bad parents isn\u2019t a bad thing, it\u2019s human. It\u2019s okay to want the love of your mother and father who hurt you and want them to be there for you during special events. This \u201ctirade\u201d is probably a very long time coming and the idea that a father could forget such hurts they did to both children could be exceedingly upsetting. At the end, the Op is a sad child again just asking her father to just be there and not ask for something he never deserved due to his actions.", "Agreed. \n\nThe parents didn't hold up their end of the social contract, a.k.a love and respect your children. Any traditions related to honouring that contract are automatically void in my opinion.", "All of y'all shaming OP for still talking to their parents are whack. Cutting someone out of your life completely is hard enough as it is, it's even harder when they're your parents. And it's not always beneficial either. OP didn't ask y'all if they should stop talking to their parents, OP asked y'all if they were wrong for not wanting their dad to walk them down the aisle. Either answer the question they asked or keep your opinions to yourself.", "NTA.  Your day, your preferences", " NTA\n\nTo have him walk with you would be so wrong , given your history.\n\nWell done for thinking of a perfect solution.\n\nCongratulations  May the sun shine on the bride", "Nope, definitely NTA.  Given your backstory, I am surprised you still talk to them at all.", "100% NTA! I love this idea! I have a complicated relationship with my father so I also dreaded the whole \u201cwalk your daughter down the aisle\u201d tradition. So I walked myself down the aisle. I told him I didn\u2019t like the tradition as it is sexist and I don\u2019t need to \u201cbe given away\u201d as I am my own person. So I say have your friend do it! It will be way more meaningful then doing something for traditions sake!", "Thank you! We already agreed and she looked really happy, so itll be a lot more meaningful!", "awww that is so cute!", "Thanks, you got this. It\u2019s always harder before it gets better but remember to write in the journal (they always recommend that) and love yourself first!", "You must have never had shitty parents. \n\nWhen you're a child being raised by emotionally immature parents you learn very quickly that nothing you say matters. You spend years politely begging your parents to acknowledge the hurt they have caused you and it never matters because your parents won't even entertain the idea of you having something intelligent to say. \n\nSo you shut your mouth and tell yourself it's easier not to argue. Until it's not so easy anymore and you explode, like your parents have done to you so many times before. \n\nIf you treat your kid(s) like shit then it shouldn't be a \"bombshell\" when they don't like you very much. The only reason the OP's parents were so \"caught off guard\" is because every shitty parent thinks they're parent of the year. This is nothing more than an extension of the mistreatment OP was already dealing with. \n\nThe fact that OP was willing to even call and let them know is too kind honestly. The majority of my family is not going to even know about my wedding until months after it's happened because I hate them that much.", "When you start your post with a strong assumption without knowing anything about the person you're responding to, you already lost the plot.\n\nI didn't rest the rest of your paragraph.", "Weird to say considering your assessment of the post is based on the assumption that OP did all of this out of spite but okay lol", "Another totally obvious NTA.", "NTA. They treated you badly and think they are owed this? Not a chance. My father will not be walking me down the Isle either. He may not even be invited. My mother definitely isn't going to be invited. It's your wedding. You deserve to be happy. Make it how you want it.", "Nta", "To be fair, you did assume that OP was rekindling the relationship to simply spite their parents. The internet is full of judgements so let\u2019s all take the seat.", "NTA. Your father wants the credit of being a loving father even though he didn't the work to be one.", "This father aisle thing is from a time when fathers where responsible for their daughters and gave this responsibility now to the husband (in a world where women couldn't be responsible for themselves). So if we translate it it to modern times it could be a responsibility to be emotional supportive. Sounds as if your friend earned that spot way more that your father, he can be thankful when he is invited. But I hope that he is not giving you any financial help with the wedding, because he will probably pull out. I wish you a nice wedding! And NTA, of course.", "NTA Your wedding, your choice. Fathers act like this is some inherent right. It's not. It's not his wedding.", "I mean you are the AH with this opinion. \n\nIf you don't hold you part the tradition you can't expect sh*t.\n\nIf you allow to be mistreated by people just cause they are your family that's on you.", "Don't forget that because it's so true. He acts like you owe this to him as some duty, but he never fulfilled the duty he owed you to be a loving dad.", "I'm sure it was your dream to have a loving and supportive father, and yet we don't always get what we want in life. NTA.", "To be fair, if OP kept the wedding a secret and their dad found out through another source, he would have EXPLODED. In OP's mind, it was better to let him know about the wedding and extend an olive branch, include him on the celebration. He shouldn't have assumed that he was going to give OP away.", "NTA. \n\nI wanted my stepdad to walk me down the aisle instead of my dad but I knew it would cause problems. I opted for having my 2 sisters walk on each side of me to try to keep the peace. He definitely reacted better than if I had my stepdad walk me but then he had an issue \"well you have 3 other siblings that feel left out now\", referring to my half siblings he had with  my stepmom(the reason he left my mom). You can't make everyone happy, but it is YOUR day, not his! Do what makes YOU HAPPY!", "NTA, it's so fucking sad that you even considered the possibility of being T A. Blood makes you related. Love, respect and loyalty makes you family. Your best friend is your real family.", "Nta, good for you for standing your ground and doing what you want. Alcoholic parents have a tendency to minimize the childhood trauma they caused. You made your own family, that\u2019s what matters, if they\u2019re going to cause a scene, I would even reconsider having them there at all. You deserve to spend your adult life happy", "NTA. If your father wanted the honor of walking down the aisle, he should have treated you better.", "NTA.  You get to have whoever you want walk you down the aisle.", "NTA It's your day if you want to have your best friend walk you down the aisle you do it.", "OP's father definitely hasn't earned the right, but I don't automatically think there is anything wrong with a father walking his daughter down the aisle. Where it becomes an issue is when the wedding actually includes the part where they ask who is giving the bride away. That shit absolutely needs to stop. The bride chose to marry. No one is \"losing\" her or giving her away.  \n\nI also think we should normalize both parents walking the bride down the aisle. If the family is close and all have a good relationship, why shouldn't mom also get the same experience?", "thank you! Yes, my best friend really helped me a lot during really dark times, and she earned that spot and my eternal thanks.", "the ability of some parents to never be satisfied with nothing even tho we change things for them to be... but thanks!", "Im reconsidering having them there, actually. Cause i keep gettin texts and calls and honestly at this point it makes me laugh"]}
