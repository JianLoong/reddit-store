He has never said that to me because he knows that the best part for me is not the shopping but that time together. I love Costco surprise deals and I bet so does your wife.

Is a more collaborative approach and positive way to ask for a change of routine that doesn\u2019t put her on the spot in public where she can\u2019t reply without having an argument in front of people and where she will not likely feel judged or attacked by her want to browse.\n\nYou might not have caused a scene, but when you say something like that in public you leave your wife with no option other than accept what you want to do or causing a scene in public if she wants to argue or do it differently.\n\nWe\u2019ve all had moments like this in relationships though and is an easy fix.

I love shopping normally but for grocery stores it's grab what you need and go. There is no need to go up and down each aisle. If I would pass Costco on my way to the mall, my grandmother would want to tag along so she can go to Costco, which was irritating as I didn't sign up for a 3 hr Costco trip.

I\u2019m one of those people who likes to browse at Sam\u2019s Club, although I only go there once/month (or less).  My husband doesn\u2019t want to browse, and I respect that.  I leave him at home unless I know it\u2019ll be a quick \u201cin and out\u201d, or we split up shopping and he does the grocery store run and I do the Sam\u2019s Club shopping.  As much as I enjoy spending time with him, by dividing and conquering we can spend time more time together doing more fun things.", "YTA\n\nWhy don't do do the shopping and let her enjoy her browsing?", "YTA, do her a favor and just stay home or make yourself useful somewhere else", "I can\u2019t even imagine marrying someone I don\u2019t love doing the mundane with. \n\nYTA. You sound like you\u2019re absorbed with podcast clips about how you need to optimize your day to maximize every waking minute you\u2019re breathing air.", "YTA. Your life must be so hard because your wife is just enjoying her time out and you cry because you hate it? So lucky my bf doesn\u2019t cry like this when we go to Sams Club. But seriously just start staying home and let her go on her own. Doing that in public is just ridiculous. I\u2019m sure if you simply told her in private that you don\u2019t enjoy going she would not care and go alone. She\u2019s literally just shopping. My bf literally LOVES walking through all the isles with me because 99% of the time we see stuff that we actually need for our apartment. Idk dude. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t throw a fit when she does stuff you like but she doesn\u2019t. Start being more nice to her, getting mad over small shit like this is kinda weird imo.", "NTA your wife is being overly sensitive about something that you just don\u2019t like to do. I get she just enjoys spending time with you and now that she knows she can pick somewhere you will both enjoy strolling around.", "I'd say he should do the grocery shopping while she browses or something", "My wife hates shopping at Costco but loves their groceries and prices.  \n\nOur Costco game plan is we go in, get everything that's on her list into the cart and then she waits in the car while I finish shopping. She's vegan so \"finish shopping\" is usually me grabbing some meat and a Polish dog on my way out.", "Yes! I learned early in my relationship that my husband and I have different shopping styles. I like to wander and he likes to rush. So it just makes more sense for me to shop alone most of the time.", "Lol. She knows where everything is and has a specific list. She only goes where she needs to.  I prefer to wander and go aisle to aisle.  Also, she only buys what she needs. I throw things in the cart that catch my eye. So she gets annoyed with me for wandering. I get annoyed with her for rushing me through, lol. It\u2019s literally the only thing we can\u2019t do together."]}
