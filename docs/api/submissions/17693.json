And I never burdened her with any childcare tasks as Rose was growing up. Kate also wasn't really interested.\n\nA while back, mom got fever and chills in the middle of the night and was ill, so I had to take her to the hospital. I called an ambulance and called Kate, to see if she could have Rose for a night while I took care of mom. She said she was on a shift and couldn't leave. I explained the situation and asked her to please find a solution. \n\nKate said she could call her girlfriend (Who I haven't even met yet, by the way) and ask her to pick up Rose. I disagreed and said I don't know her. Also, Kate goes through girlfriends faster than she'd even like to admit, and not all of them are types that can be trusted with kids. Kate said there was nothing else she could do.\n\nI got really upset, and said she was being a horrible sister leaving me alone in an emergency like this. She hung up. I had to take Rose with me to the hospital. She stayed up all night.\n\nLater, when Kate came to visit mom. She told me I was being dramatic, and told me I should've just let Rose stay with her girlfriend. I told her exactly why I didn't, and said while her career was excellent, her personal life is nothing short of a mess and I was not going to let my kid stay with someone I didn't and probably won't ever know.\n\nShe got really upset and called me arrogant.

You're entitled and self-centered. The world doesn't revolve around you or your kid. Neither you nor your kid are the main characters in anyone's life but your own.", "Soft YTA. I understand the burden of being a single parent and also responsible for your mom, but you can't expect your sister to up and leave her shift to babysit your daughter. It would have been different if she refused to leave a party, but her job is important not just to her but to her patients. Considering that nightshifts are notoriously understaffed, she was likely responsible for people's lives, someone could have died if she just left her shift. How would you have reacted if nobody could take care of your mom at the hospital, because the doctor on call had left their shift to babysit someone's kid?\n\nShe offered the best solution she could.

It\u2019s your child who needs a babysitter. You asked your sister, they were at work, so it\u2019s YOUR job as the parent to find a solution, not your sister.  I know being a single mom is hard but it\u2019s not your sisters problem.  It will be ok for a 6 year old to be up at night in the event of a medical emergency. And she can even hang out in the waiting room with you.  We did it many times with a sick grandparent when I was her age.
