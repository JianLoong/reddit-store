And I never burdened her with any childcare tasks as Rose was growing up. Kate also wasn't really interested.\n\nA while back, mom got fever and chills in the middle of the night and was ill, so I had to take her to the hospital. I called an ambulance and called Kate, to see if she could have Rose for a night while I took care of mom. She said she was on a shift and couldn't leave. I explained the situation and asked her to please find a solution. \n\nKate said she could call her girlfriend (Who I haven't even met yet, by the way) and ask her to pick up Rose. I disagreed and said I don't know her. Also, Kate goes through girlfriends faster than she'd even like to admit, and not all of them are types that can be trusted with kids. Kate said there was nothing else she could do.\n\nI got really upset, and said she was being a horrible sister leaving me alone in an emergency like this. She hung up. I had to take Rose with me to the hospital. She stayed up all night.\n\nLater, when Kate came to visit mom. She told me I was being dramatic, and told me I should've just let Rose stay with her girlfriend. I told her exactly why I didn't, and said while her career was excellent, her personal life is nothing short of a mess and I was not going to let my kid stay with someone I didn't and probably won't ever know.\n\nShe got really upset and called me arrogant.

You're entitled and self-centered. The world doesn't revolve around you or your kid. Neither you nor your kid are the main characters in anyone's life but your own.", "Soft YTA. I understand the burden of being a single parent and also responsible for your mom, but you can't expect your sister to up and leave her shift to babysit your daughter. It would have been different if she refused to leave a party, but her job is important not just to her but to her patients. Considering that nightshifts are notoriously understaffed, she was likely responsible for people's lives, someone could have died if she just left her shift. How would you have reacted if nobody could take care of your mom at the hospital, because the doctor on call had left their shift to babysit someone's kid?\n\nShe offered the best solution she could.

It\u2019s your child who needs a babysitter. You asked your sister, they were at work, so it\u2019s YOUR job as the parent to find a solution, not your sister.  I know being a single mom is hard but it\u2019s not your sisters problem.  It will be ok for a 6 year old to be up at night in the event of a medical emergency. And she can even hang out in the waiting room with you.  We did it many times with a sick grandparent when I was her age.

Rose was probably scared after her grandma was taken to the hospital and stay near her mom was comforting.", "> AITA for asking my sister to babysit my daughter and not her girlfriend?\n\nWhy would your sister babysit her girlfriend?", "YTA\n\nYou don't really think doctors just get to peace out in the middle of a shift?", "YTA\n\nYour sister is a doctor. She can't just skip a shift, especially on such short notice, to watch your kid. It's up to **you** to find a solution that doesn't include making demands of Kate or insulting her.", "YTA. \n\nYour sister is a doctor. She can't just leave work like most people in most jobs, how can you not be cognizant of that? \n\nYour kid, your responsibility, period.  Your 6 year old isn't going to die from spending a night waiting around in an emergency room. It's probably something you should have considered when you made the decision to be a single parent. \n\nHow come you have no one else in your life you can call on to watch your kid? That doesn't say good things about you. Where do you get off criticizing Kate's dating life?\n\n> And I never burdened her with any childcare tasks as Rose was growing up.

She could be tending to people who are having medical emergencies of their own. She couldn't leave so she offered you the one other solution she had. You didn't like it... and I get it, you don't know the other person so I understand why you wouldn't want to leave your kid with them.\n\nHowever, that is nor your sisters fault. \n\nAnd you were arrogant. And you clearly are a mix of jealous of your sister and also somehow feel smugly superior to her... which is a fun combo. Then to throw your disdain for her personal life in her face when it has nothing to do with the situation is just you being petulant and bratty.", "Would you be ok with it if it was your daughter in the hospital and her doctor just suddenly leave in the middle of treating your daughter to babysit their niece?

Twice.", "YTA, NOT for not trusting your kid with a stranger, which you shouldn't, but because you demanded she find a solution to YOUR problem, she offered the only one she had, and you called her a horrible sister for not... just magically having a solution to your problem.", "YTA\n\nThis was an emergency but Kate wasn\u2019t able to leave - didn\u2019t have a solution other than the one she offered. It\u2019s okay to not want her to be picked up by a partner you haven\u2019t met (even though they are doing a favour) but the words you used sound very judgmental. \n\nYou are being very judgmental and holier than thou of your sister\u2019s life and her partners and from this is sounds like you expected her to abandon her shift(taking care of other patients) to babysit.", "YTA I get that this was an emergency, however your sister is a doctor who was at work! Out of most professions this is one of the most understandably non flexible. You asked her to find a solution to your problem,  and she did but you didn't like it. Instead, you insulted her and blamed her for your inability to figure out what to do. I know it was stressful but the way it was handled was messy and your comments on her love life was unnecessary. There were classier ways to explain being uncomfortable with a stranger watching your child without being condescending. Your sister's not a miracle worker.", "YTA. Because you can't go asking an MD to leave their shift to take care of your kid, and you don't seem to get that at all. She did come up with a solution, which you didn't like. And yeah, you're being dramatic.\n\nBut let's also talk about why you're being so judgey about your sister's personal life. Is it because she is so much more accomplished than you? Is it because she's lesbian? Because it's coming across as seriously sus.", "INFO  this child has a father I'm assuming - where was he?", "YTA it's on you to find childcare, not her.

Also.YTA.", "YTA, and you also sound a touch jealous.\n\nThere are many jobs where people can't walk off at the drop of a hat and the medical field is one of them.

I don\u2019t think a single mother who can\u2019t rely on her child\u2019s father or anyone else on their life has a right to call their sister who is a Doctor a hot mess when it comes to their personal life. \n\nYou sound jealous and entitled.

That being said, getting mad at your sister for not leaving her job to watch your kid is AH material.
