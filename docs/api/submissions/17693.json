And I never burdened her with any childcare tasks as Rose was growing up. Kate also wasn't really interested.\n\nA while back, mom got fever and chills in the middle of the night and was ill, so I had to take her to the hospital. I called an ambulance and called Kate, to see if she could have Rose for a night while I took care of mom. She said she was on a shift and couldn't leave. I explained the situation and asked her to please find a solution. \n\nKate said she could call her girlfriend (Who I haven't even met yet, by the way) and ask her to pick up Rose. I disagreed and said I don't know her. Also, Kate goes through girlfriends faster than she'd even like to admit, and not all of them are types that can be trusted with kids. Kate said there was nothing else she could do.\n\nI got really upset, and said she was being a horrible sister leaving me alone in an emergency like this. She hung up. I had to take Rose with me to the hospital. She stayed up all night.\n\nLater, when Kate came to visit mom. She told me I was being dramatic, and told me I should've just let Rose stay with her girlfriend. I told her exactly why I didn't, and said while her career was excellent, her personal life is nothing short of a mess and I was not going to let my kid stay with someone I didn't and probably won't ever know.\n\nShe got really upset and called me arrogant.

I understand the burden of being a single parent and also responsible for your mom, but you can't expect your sister to up and leave her shift to babysit your daughter. It would have been different if she refused to leave a party, but her job is important not just to her but to her patients. Considering that nightshifts are notoriously understaffed, she was likely responsible for people's lives, someone could have died if she just left her shift. How would you have reacted if nobody could take care of your mom at the hospital, because the doctor on call had left their shift to babysit someone's kid?\n\nShe offered the best solution she could.

It\u2019s your child who needs a babysitter. You asked your sister, they were at work, so it\u2019s YOUR job as the parent to find a solution, not your sister.  I know being a single mom is hard but it\u2019s not your sisters problem.  It will be ok for a 6 year old to be up at night in the event of a medical emergency. And she can even hang out in the waiting room with you.  We did it many times with a sick grandparent when I was her age.

This is most likely a big reason why your sister has had multiple partners. \n\nI don't blame you for not wanting your daughter to be taken care of by a stranger, but it's not your sister's job to find you a babysitter. I was a single mother, so I know what you deal with. Sometimes you have to take your child with you when there's an emergency and you can't get childcare. Your mom was going to the ER. You don't need to take care of her there. You'd only be getting in the way of the hospital staff.", "So your sister was supposed to abandon her job because you couldn't find a babysitter?

But that doesn't mean your relatives' lives go on hold when you need their assistance. My own mother is a nurse. If I got sick at school as a little kid, she couldn't just leave work to pick me up, my father or grandmother would come.

Your sister is successful. She's made the right choices in life. And she's having fun dating around. Why do you feel the need to complain about that?", "Yta.  The expectation for her to find a solution and leave in the middle of her shift is beyond absurd.  Op never burdened her with childcare requests?  Well, it's not the sister's kid, so there should be no expectation of it.   And if mom was in the hospital, then take care of your kid and leave your number with the nurse.

Like yeah, great go if you can obviously, but technically she could have gone alone. Maybe it's because my experience with this has been very different.\n\nI say this because my husband's grandma who is well into her 90s has had to go to the hospital a number of times for falls and other small things in the last couple of years. She lives in a retirement home that helps with some stuff, so they call the ambulance and send her off, then call my husband and his sister to give the heads up.

If watching her sisters child would make it easier to get THEIR mother the emergency care she needs, she should or go herself or contribute to the situation in some way. Op is NTA. It\u2019s both of their mom. Both should be involved taking part in helping each other as a family for this incident imo", "Having been in healthcare, I also wondered whether it was entirely necessary for OP to be there the whole time. So many hospitals will do a lot to be able to keep extra people out of the ER right now. In this situation, when there is no perfect solution, you have to figure out something other than expecting a doctor on shift to leave their hospital to come babysit. If my sister was unavailable, I would have asked her for suggestions. Likely she knows the hospital, and may have better info on how to proceed.", "So what if she did? She isn\u2019t required to help her out. And it sounds like OP is an insufferable person to deal with, especially if she doesn\u2019t get her way.", "OK so I have seen multiple of your comments basically stating the same thing and clearly you suck at reading comprehension but here let me try and say it like multiple other people have. HER SISTER IS A DOCTOR AND CAN NOT JUST WALK OUT OF WORK WHEN EVER SHE WANTS JUST BECAUSE HER MOM IS SICK AND HER SISTER DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO FIND CHILD CARE IN AN EMERGENCY. IT IS DANGEROUS AND THE DOCTOR COULD GET IN TROUBLE FOR LEAVING WORK LIKE THAT.", "Also, if Kate was able to leave because this was an emergency, it's wild to send the sister who is an MD home to babysit the kid and not with the mom.", "Yeah OP called an ambulance, which where I live would give the receiving nurse a handover with presenting complaint, prior medical conditions, medications etc, which the paramedics (all our ambulances are staffed by paramedics) would have gathered from OP and her mum either before leaving or in transit depending (if they had time to assess on scene or she was sick enough to \u201cload and go\u201d which doesn\u2019t sound the case). If when the dr came to assess they decided between this assessment, the nurse assessment and whatever OPs mum herself could tell them they needed more, they could call OP. That\u2019s not an uncommon situation where I am because people have kids, pets, families, they live far away, whatever reason that means they can\u2019t be there right then. And like, sometimes they just don\u2019t want to hang round the hospital waiting, which, totally fair, I\u2019m being paid and I don\u2019t want to be here either", "I would agree if we were talking about childcare for an appointment or for work but the real emergency is getting mom to the hospital. Kate took responsibility for helping in this and tried to find a solution but a lot of commmenters are stating it as if she had zero obligation in helping coordinate getting her mom to the hospital. Even Kate saw that she needed to try to find a way to help but a lot of the commenters are implying OP should have been solely responsible for getting mom to the hospital.", "I only had an issue with the commenter saying \"it is YOUR job to find a solution.\" No, it's not. The problem isn't childcare. The problem is getting the mom to the hospital and it is both of their problems to figure out, not just the OP's.", "Agreed but \"your emergency is not her problem\" is inaccurate. It was Kate's mother too so it is an emergency for both of then, not just OP. Kate may not have been able to leave but to imply that it is entirely OPs problem and Kate shouldn't have had any obligation to help is wrong. \nI agree with what others are saying that Kate came up with a solution and the OP didn't like it but I disagree with saying that the entire situation with the mom needing emergency care was not Kate's problem.", "Are you dumb or what? She can't leave. I'm a doctor and I can tell you, we are not allowed to leave our shift, there has to be a doctor in our place if we do, and it can't be done out of nowhere. Her mother is obviously very important for her, but that doesn't give her the right to leave people who are sedated, on tubes, or in any other treatment unsupervised. If she left she could be sued and even lose her medical license. So yes, it was, at the moment, up to the sister who was home to take the mother.", "I\u2019m not going to give the benefit of the doubt to someone who comes off as a major asshole in a story they wrote trying to make themselves sound like an angel and still failed miserably.", "The information she gave makes her sound like a major asshole. Her sister is a doctor what the hell is she suppose to do?", "Yes... I 100% agree. But commenting that she's a single mother who went out of her way to choose to have a kid with a deadbeat isn't something we have any information about, so there's no reason to say that.", "There\u2019s a very big reason to say it, she attacked her sisters personal life. If your personal life ain\u2019t in order you shouldn\u2019t be commenting on another persons personal life. The single doctor isn\u2019t the one who\u2019s personal life is getting in the way of doing something she has to do.", "Except we don't know he's a dead beat? He could be just dead... or the child could be the product of coercion... or a 1 night stand, who knows? That's the point.", "Well you can give the benefit of the doubt to a major asshole all you want. I am not going to."]}
