He has a daughter who is the same age as me. We don\u2019t really get along. We don\u2019t hate each other but we don\u2019t see each other as sisters or even friends. \n\nMy mom and stepdad are financially stable but don\u2019t have a whole lot of disposable income. My dad isn\u2019t super rich either but he\u2019s single and I\u2019m his only kid so he can afford to get me more nice stuff. I turned 16 last month and he took me to LA for 10 days. He let me invite five people and I took my two cousins on my dads side and three friends. \n\nWhen my mom found out about the trip she was really mad. Apparently her and my stepdad were planning a trip to Disney this winter and we\u2019ve never been so she wanted our first trip to be as a family. She tried to convince me to not go but it was during my dads time so there\u2019s nothing she could do to stop me. After she realized she couldn\u2019t stop me she tried to convince me to take my stepsister so she wouldn\u2019t feel jealous. \n\nI talked to my dad and he said he wouldn\u2019t mind taking her if I really wanted to. We were driving and my dad\u2019s car can fit eight people but it gets really uncomfortable with three people in the backseat. I wouldn\u2019t have minded having her there but I didn\u2019t particularly want her there either, so I decided to not invite her. My mom and stepsister were pissed to say the least. My stepsister threw a tantrum on the night before I left but I didn\u2019t really care. \n\nI got back a few days ago. Yesterday she posted a story about spoiled b*tches going on fancy vacations while she had to work over the summer. She didn\u2019t mention me specifically but I knew she was talking about me. Some of our friends came over today and ny trip came up in our conversation. My stepsister basically said that I\u2019m a spoiled brat who gets everything I want while she has to spend her whole summer working just to buy a decent car (my dad got me one). She also said that Disney is just for little kids. \n\nShe\u2019s been acting like this since I got back and I\u2019m pretty sick of it. I said she\u2019s just jealous and I told our friends about how she was acting like a little kid (crying and throwing a tantrum) because she wanted to go to a place that\u2019s for little kids. Some of our friends started laughing.She got really upset and went to her room and didn\u2019t come out until they left. She told my mom and she\u2019s really mad at me. \n\nShe threatened to take away my phone but I told her that she can\u2019t because my dad paid for it and she started yelling at me and calling me an ungrateful brat and she said that O can go and live with my dad if i\u2019m gonna be like this. I called him and told him to pick me up in the morning and she\u2019s really upset because she didn\u2019t actually mean it but she was just really mad because I embarrassed my stepsister in front of her friends.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m at my dad\u2019s right now and my moms been calling me nonstop.
