I'm not sure they've started coughing up yet.", "I'm not a monster; I'd pay for a life-saving surgery if he could show me the hospital paperwork and I could confirm it with the hospital. \n\nHe and his fiancee can always have a courthouse marriage.

But I read somewhere that some rapper with about 8 kids by 6 different women ended up paying only $1,000 in child support for kid #8, while baby mother #1 got five figures per month.

But either way, it's financially ruinous (at least in the USA) for a man to have children with multiple women before he's rich enough to afford them.\n\nI was doing a little research and found this rapper dude (NBA Youngboy) who is 23 years old and has 10 kids with 6-8 different women. His child support bill must be through the roof since he out-earns all his baby mothers.\n\nHoly s\\*it, my dad *isn't* the dumbest man on the planet! At least the women he impregnates and marries seem to have enough family money to maintain his lifestyle for a while.", "Honestly, child support hits middle-class the hardest. I see minimum wage (about $30k in my state) employees only getting $50 taken out of their checks. I understand that they can't really pay more, but that's not going to make much of a difference to the kid and barely worth the paperwork involved. Wealthy people can afford their child support; Kanye will be fine paying $200k/month.\n\nI've seen people making $50k paying $10k in child support and still getting deeper in arrears.

Yikes.", "Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, but I'm your father, so fund me maybe?", "Ooh, give him a really long, rambling and extremely dull inventory of all your (fictitious) debts.

I'm pretty sure every state has a maximum amount they'll garnish a paycheck so they probably won't be able to take any more out for 4 kids than 3, he'll just be paying back support forever.", "NTA.  Not that you've met him and know more about him, there is no reason to stay in contact with him.

It sounds like you would help your mom if she needed it, so I\u2019m guessing you wouldn\u2019t.\n\nI think donating to charity is a good thing to do, but it would make a lot more sense to give a few thousand dollars to a food bank than to this guy.", "NTA.

But also he's a creep who sleeps with women half his age.\n\nWhen he needs to prove he's a responsible potential partner, he can't do it because he's broke (no judgement for me on the broke part, we all struggle).
