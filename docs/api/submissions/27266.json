To my surprise, he still did not graduate high school, he stayed 3 years on 10th grade, 3 on 11th and currently on his 3rd trying to finish highschool while trying nightschool as well. He told me how I destroyed him mentally, turned his life upside down and thought i was a genuine friend, and that he had to get stuck in school for a decade because I abandoned him. Called me the biggest asshole and I should have overlooked what ha have done because we were only 15.\n\nI did not know what to reply other than being sorry he had to go through that and i still stand by the decision i took because it was too much even for a highschoolers. Turned off the call, asked around and frankly what he said about not graduating is indeed true.\n\nSorry for my bad English since it is not my first language.

NTA", "NTA\n\nHe did this to himself.  How is it supposed to be your fault that he had to take multiple tries to finish each year long after you had left school?\n\nHe had a choice and chose poorly.  Forget him and move on as its not your fault and seems like he is trying to drag you back into things.", "NTA. This dude was a dick at 15 and deserved what he got. If he can\u2019t get over it, it\u2019s on him.", "NTA. This is victim blaming of a sort, he bullied, harrased and made your life and your friends lives miserable. When you and your friends called him on his behavior he went and did something stupid which messed his life up. He did this to himself and is looking for anyone else to blame. Cut contact with this guy and save yourself the hassel, he isn't worth your time and never has been.", "NTA.  His failure to graduate after 10 years is strictly and solely on him. The drama that he started is but an excuse that he's been using for all this time.", "So\u2026\n\nThe guy who used to bully you is now blaming you for his life choices.\n\nSeems someone hasn\u2019t changed in the slightest.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. This doesn\u2019t sound like your fault. You might feel guilty, and that emotion is valid, but this isn\u2019t on you. It\u2019s easy to blame others in bad situations, and sometimes that blame is deserved, but it doesn\u2019t sound like it here.\n\nIf you feel willing and able, support him if you can. If not, it\u2019s not your job, let it go.", "So you confronted him 10 year ago and he's still stuck thinking about this confrontation? \ud83e\udd14 \n\nIt sucks that he did not graduate but I don't think it had anything to do with you. You just described how this guy, at 15, was already playing mindgames. What makes you think he's not doing it again? \n\nNtA \n\nMove on. You've lived without this friendship for 10 years, you will not miss it in the next 10 to come.", "NTA, and don't feel guilty for a guy who couldn't get his life together. All he has done for the last 9 years is look for someone to blame you responded so he blamed you.", "NTA\n\nHe is experiencing the consequences of his actions. Sucks to be him.

He is well into his 20s and still in high school?? That's just plain dumb. Anyway, in a case like you've stated, you would be NTA.\n\nIf he wants to pin his failure on you, that's on him, not you. To accuse a kid of \"destroying\" them at 15, and not getting past it enough to function by adulthood, is a failing on his part. You're no more responsible for his actions than you would be anyone else's. It was on him to seek help if he was so distraught, if not then than once he became an adult. I did some nice things and also some wicked mean things as a kid. I don't really know anyone who could say otherwise. We all have to grow up at some point and take responsibility for ourselves, somehow learn to live with any traumatic events and move forward. He is TAH, for blaming you.\n\nI think you shouldn't let him guilt you into questioning yourself. \ud83d\ude09\n\n(Seriously, who would stay in high school for that long???)", "Nearly a decade ij high school and he is blaming you? What? This guy is nuts.  And problematic. What is he, a 22 year old senior at this point? \n\nWhere is his family in all this?", "the drugs really went to his head it seems. what, he is 30 and blames you despite you being out of his life gor 10+ years? he was never going to make it in life without any accountability.\n\nnot your fault, NTA", "NTA. You can feel sympathy for the way his life is going without accepting responsibility for it.\n\nTry to shake off the guilty feelings. I admire the maturity of your teenage friend group, who were wise enough to cut ties with him. It's no kid's responsibility to sacrifice their wellbeing to rehabilitate a bully, and it's not your responsibility now to take ownership of his actions.", "NTA, he is trying to guilt you into a relationship again. Don't fall for it, it sounds like you have nothing to feel guilty about. Go no-contact, you don't want him in your life.", "NTA.  You are not, and were not, obliged to take that crap from him and him failing high school is on him.", "Yta because this story is just made up. Somehow I doubt a school is going to let someone in their mid 20s attend high school. After a certain point, they\u2019re going to tell you yours on your own.", "NTA. This is ridiculous.", "NTA- 15 is old enough to know not to be an AH. If he genuinely wanted to be friends with you then he wouldn't have done any of the things he did nor would he try and guilt trip you over cutting off a toxic relationship (him). He's not a friend.", "NTA\n\nHe is blaming you for his own mistakes. You are not responsible for this person"]}
