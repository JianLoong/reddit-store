He is well into his 20s and still in high school?? That's just plain dumb. Anyway, in a case like you've stated, you would be NTA.\n\nIf he wants to pin his failure on you, that's on him, not you. To accuse a kid of \"destroying\" them at 15, and not getting past it enough to function by adulthood, is a failing on his part. You're no more responsible for his actions than you would be anyone else's. It was on him to seek help if he was so distraught, if not then than once he became an adult. I did some nice things and also some wicked mean things as a kid. I don't really know anyone who could say otherwise. We all have to grow up at some point and take responsibility for ourselves, somehow learn to live with any traumatic events and move forward.

You can feel sympathy for the way his life is going without accepting responsibility for it.\n\nTry to shake off the guilty feelings. I admire the maturity of your teenage friend group, who were wise enough to cut ties with him. It's no kid's responsibility to sacrifice their wellbeing to rehabilitate a bully, and it's not your responsibility now to take ownership of his actions.", "NTA, he is trying to guilt you into a relationship again. Don't fall for it, it sounds like you have nothing to feel guilty about. Go no-contact, you don't want him in your life.", "NTA.  You are not, and were not, obliged to take that crap from him and him failing high school is on him.", "Yta because this story is just made up.

It sounds like the problem was always him, and if he hasn't gotten your countries equivalence of a GED in 9 years that is entirely on him.", "NTA. None of this is your fault. It's the result of his choices, namely, to treat you and your other friends badly after you befriended him.\n\nHe's responsible for getting in with a bad crowd and not studying.

Maybe if he wasn't such a shit person things would've ended up differently, but it's not your fault he's an AH.

I know someone like this but didn\u2019t meet them until they were already an adult & had given up on schooling. This person dropped out with no qualifications to their name but if you ask them it was everyone else\u2019s fault. Their parents for splitting up and not keeping a better eye on them that they were actually going to school, their friends for being bad influences and encouraging them to skive, their teachers for not trying hard enough etc. None of it was their fault. \nThis guy has no one to blame but himself for his bad decisions. It isn\u2019t your fault at all, block him and forget him.", "NTA-  he is a bully who made bad decisions.  How do you fail to graduate for 9 years?  He sounds like an awful person, who instead of owning up and fixing his mistakes, has doubled down and tried to blame someone else.\n\nAlso, how much do you know is actually true? Yeah he failed to graduate, but I\u2019ve never heard of a 27 year old being in an 11th grade class.  You could be lying but i think he is manipulating you, just like back then.  He at this point would\u2019ve been pushed to get something akin to a GED, which if at ~27 years old, you still can\u2019t get and your blaming something a high schooler told you at 15 is just pathetic", "Nta", "I don't know what he's smoking, but in my world, there is personal accountability.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, finishing school is on you.

In the US, yeah that probably wouldn\u2019t happen, but I don\u2019t think either of us can say that there aren\u2019t other countries where it does. Checking things against what you know is important, but it\u2019s even more important to understand that there are limits to your own experience.

Not because one friend group gave them the boot. Heck I know people who were bullied and went to medical school.", "I had a college acquaintance, older than me. Graduated, visited a friend living in college town. We went to a fast food place. He was managing it, 3 classes short of graduation. \n\nI assume if I went back he'd still be there.", "A lot of people I know that didn't finish school, eventually did or passed the GED, etc. 3 classes short of graduation is usually a 4 month commitment. I hope they get their diploma eventually", "This was for his BA though and we haven't crossed paths since. It was in an era before the internet and I graduated with a woman who learned a month before graduation that she was 3 credits short and took a correspondence course which was the available option. There's no reason he couldn't have finished that way if class times didn't fit his schedule.\n\nMy advisor and I met every semester and we compared my transcript with general requirements and my major requirements from the beginning each time.\n\nHad that girl's advisor done the same she wouldn't have needed the correspondence course."]}
