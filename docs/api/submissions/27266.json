He is well into his 20s and still in high school?? That's just plain dumb. Anyway, in a case like you've stated, you would be NTA.\n\nIf he wants to pin his failure on you, that's on him, not you. To accuse a kid of \"destroying\" them at 15, and not getting past it enough to function by adulthood, is a failing on his part. You're no more responsible for his actions than you would be anyone else's. It was on him to seek help if he was so distraught, if not then than once he became an adult. I did some nice things and also some wicked mean things as a kid. I don't really know anyone who could say otherwise. We all have to grow up at some point and take responsibility for ourselves, somehow learn to live with any traumatic events and move forward. He is TAH, for blaming you.\n\nI think you shouldn't let him guilt you into questioning yourself. \ud83d\ude09\n\n(Seriously, who would stay in high school for that long???)", "Nearly a decade ij high school and he is blaming you? What? This guy is nuts.  And problematic.

You can feel sympathy for the way his life is going without accepting responsibility for it.\n\nTry to shake off the guilty feelings. I admire the maturity of your teenage friend group, who were wise enough to cut ties with him. It's no kid's responsibility to sacrifice their wellbeing to rehabilitate a bully, and it's not your responsibility now to take ownership of his actions.", "NTA, he is trying to guilt you into a relationship again. Don't fall for it, it sounds like you have nothing to feel guilty about. Go no-contact, you don't want him in your life.", "NTA.  You are not, and were not, obliged to take that crap from him and him failing high school is on him.", "Yta because this story is just made up. Somehow I doubt a school is going to let someone in their mid 20s attend high school. After a certain point, they\u2019re going to tell you you\u2019re on your own.", "NTA. This is ridiculous.", "NTA- 15 is old enough to know not to be an AH.

What a dick!!!", "NTA, manipulative dick is trying to manipulate you, what a surprise", "NTA.

He was a toxic friend and you removed him from your group. End of story. What he did after that was his choice. You didn't make him do anything nor sabotaged him in any way!

No?

Block and continue with your life.", "I think this situation calls for a \"lol sucks to suck\" and then a ghost and screenshots sent to your friend group.", "NTA . He is blaming you for the consequences of his actions. Sure, you could have done charity work and kept the guy around while trying to keep him on a good path, but why would any sane person give up their high school years to cater to someone who abuses them? Just block him, I bet he contacts you soon asking for a hand out, but he\u2019ll frame it as an investment and a way for you to make high school up for him.", "NTA, this guy hasn't changed much. In fact, it sounds like he got worse", "NTA. He is a toxic, manipulative asshole, and a typical narcissist; ignore him, ignore anything he says, any claim he makes, any attempt on his part to contact. Don't bother arguing, don't ask questions, just cut him out.", "NTA. We are once again exploring the world of \ud83d\udcab consequences \ud83d\udcab.

Technically you are entitled to repeat a level 3 or 4 times as long as you are paying money, which is very expensive for highschool. If all of this still not working out they put you in night schooling aka school for slow learners.", "It's no one's fault but their own if they need 9 years to finish high school.", "I don\u2019t think this is in a first or second world country", "If he can't be blamed for what he did at 15, then neither can he blame you for deciding to ditch him at 15. It's gotta be both ways or not at all.\n\nAlso, it makes zero sense that you would have any blame for the 10 years after you were supposedly friends.
