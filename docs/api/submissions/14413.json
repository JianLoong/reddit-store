One as a child and one as an adult. \n\nThe one as a child was a family dog we had for years. He loved the entire family and was so gentle and sweet. Until one night my parents had a bad verbal argument with lots of screaming. The dog got between them. Then my Dad moved too fast and got bit. Dad was a big dog lover and understood the dog was protecting Mom. Argument over they went to go to bed. NOPE That dog was not having. No matter how much Mom tried to coax the dog it took a week before he let Dad in the bedroom.\n\nAs an adult woman living alone in an apartment I adopted a male Cocker Spaniel. I had a steady bf. He got to go in the apartment but never the bedroom. We tried a trainer. That dog wouldn\u2019t have it. (Should have listened to the dog) Bf got violent at his place. I moved with the dog. After that the only man he allowed in the apartment was my father. Maintenance came to do work I had to walk him outside.\n\nMale cockers can get very territorial over the women and children. Especially if the only male human adult is gone a lot. Even a female can exhibit these behaviors. Letting that dog stay in the bed when you\u2019re gone then kicking it out only when you\u2019re home is going to cause behavior issues!\n\nThe humans need to figure this out! You\u2019re sending mixed signals to that dog and it\u2019s not fair to the dog!", "NTA you didn't want to share your bed with the dog that's fair enough,\nDogs are only small but can take up a lot of room in a bed with two people.\n\nIt's not comfortable", "NTA  \n Your boundary was already set and she crossed it", "NTA.

She agreed to it when she had no intention of keeping to it.", "IDK I just think she could make it into her and the puppies own space instead of a guest room.

The examples you used also aren\u2019t even relevant because those scenarios don\u2019t include the possibility that it may become harder to train the dog to not sleep on the bed when he\u2019s home.\n\nEdit: where are you even getting that he\u2019s gone 3 weeks every single month?

There were posts where someone put some meat replacement in someone's food instead of actual meat and the overall consensus was: don't fuck with other people's food, even when you know for certain that it won't harm them. But when it's about the place you sleep, the husband just needs to suck it up that the wife lied to him about it and that he has no say over their shared bed. And his boundaries are invalid because \"he didn't notice anyways\".\n\nAnd the point about comfort you made is actually a very good one. Sleep is all about comfort and not being comfortable in your own bed can affect your quality of sleep. And if there is one thing that is difficult to adjust it's how you feel about things that only affect you when you notice them.", "He wasn\u2019t uncomfortable previously. Why? Because he literally couldn\u2019t tell that the dog had been sleeping there. He could not tell at all. No idea. Zero impact on him.\n\nHe sees the dog and everything suddenly becomes terrible, lol. He needs to chill out. The hotel bedding he\u2019s sleeping in is 100X filthier than freshly laundered home bedding.\n\nEdit: OP, Why don\u2019t you take a black light to your hotel room and one to your master bedroom and compare.", "You keep making assumptions and when they\u2019re rationally removed from the equation, you come up with another one. The dog already doesn\u2019t sleep in the bed when he\u2019s home. There\u2019s no reason to *assume* anything other than that. Why assume he\u2019s the breadwinner? He never said that. His wife could run a business out of the home or just WFH.  He doesn\u2019t say if she has a job or not. Another assumption.\n\nWe\u2019re going to have to agree to disagree. If you ever get married, you\u2019ll understand that ultimatums don\u2019t work, and that\u2019s exactly what he did. That kind of behavior, along with a refusal to be understanding of your spouse\u2019s plight, absolutely leads to strife in marriage and once cracks like that form, they\u2019re not easy to patch up.\n\nETA: You\u2019re absolutely right about the work situation for OP\u2019s travel. I read it as gone for 2-3 weeks a month. Regardless he says he travels \u201ca lot,\u201d so by definite she\u2019s  without a bed partner \u201ca lot\u201d."]}
