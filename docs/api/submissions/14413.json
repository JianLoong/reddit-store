One as a child and one as an adult. \n\nThe one as a child was a family dog we had for years. He loved the entire family and was so gentle and sweet. Until one night my parents had a bad verbal argument with lots of screaming. The dog got between them. Then my Dad moved too fast and got bit. Dad was a big dog lover and understood the dog was protecting Mom. Argument over they went to go to bed. NOPE That dog was not having. No matter how much Mom tried to coax the dog it took a week before he let Dad in the bedroom.\n\nAs an adult woman living alone in an apartment I adopted a male Cocker Spaniel. I had a steady bf. He got to go in the apartment but never the bedroom. We tried a trainer. That dog wouldn\u2019t have it. (Should have listened to the dog) Bf got violent at his place. I moved with the dog. After that the only man he allowed in the apartment was my father. Maintenance came to do work I had to walk him outside.\n\nMale cockers can get very territorial over the women and children. Especially if the only male human adult is gone a lot. Even a female can exhibit these behaviors. Letting that dog stay in the bed when you\u2019re gone then kicking it out only when you\u2019re home is going to cause behavior issues!\n\nThe humans need to figure this out! You\u2019re sending mixed signals to that dog and it\u2019s not fair to the dog!", "NTA you didn't want to share your bed with the dog that's fair enough,\nDogs are only small but can take up a lot of room in a bed with two people.\n\nIt's not comfortable", "NTA  \n Your boundary was already set and she crossed it", "NTA.
