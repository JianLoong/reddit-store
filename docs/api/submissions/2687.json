She shared just about any information told to her. I didn't want to tell my in-laws I was pregnant before my second trimester, but my husband was so excited to share the news with them. When we told my in-laws their first reaction was \"don't worry we won't put this in Facebook\". Okay...well fast forward a few weeks we were visiting them while in town for a wedding. They had announced to most family and friends I was pregnant without asking us first. I was upset but not much I could do about something that already happened. After the visit I see my MIL announced she was going to be a grandma on Facebook. I was still in my first trimester and worried about a miscarriage. I asked my MIL to check in before announcing my information. Her reaction? \"I don't understand, I already told everyone you're pregnant so why can't I say it on Facebook? I didn't use your name or anything.\". I explained how we had planned a photo announcement and we were waiting until I was farther along to tell people. She slightly apologized and didn't talk to me for a few months. \n\nFast forward to my baby shower. She came to visit and was for the most part fine. When she left I had posted photos from the baby shower with no announcements attached. She then posted our babies name and ultrasound photos without asking. I was LIVID. We specifically asked her not to post his name since we were waiting until he was born to share. I called my husband crying because I had asked his mom several times to let me share baby announcements first and I haven't gotten to share one first my entire pregnancy. He called his mom angry explaining she had really messed up. Her response? \"I feel like I have to walk on eggshells with you two, why does it matter if I put it on the internet if I told everyone his name already?\". \n\nNow she's planning on staying with us the first two weeks our child is born. But has informed us we hurt her feeling so much she doesn't plan on helping or talking to us much. \n\nAITA for not just letting her actions go and keeping the peace? \n\n*EDIT: My husband is taking over communication because I don't feel comfortable talking to my in-laws anymore. They're still planning on staying for 2 weeks but have an Airbnb. Still not ideal, but they don't understand why this long visit is overwhelming.\n\nI've seen a few comments asking why I feel the need to share with them when they consistently disregard my boundaries. A few years ago they helped us with the down payment on our home and I guess even with how inconsiderate they are I feel obligated to try and share my life with them.", "created_utc": 1668816074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyyht1/aita_for_restricting_what_my_mil_care_post_about/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wants to take over your baby.  She wants your child as her do over baby.  She will disrupt or take over your baby duties.  She raised her children, she is now a spectator in the stands while you and your husband are on the field playing the game of life.  You do NOT need her staying at your house.  You NEED your husband with you for the first week.  You will be vulnerable and trying to find a routine with the new baby.  This is something that only the new mom and baby can do.  Your husband is there to help and do the laundry, cooking, ordering takeout, etc.  honestly, unless you had a really bad Birth experience, you are up and moving and caring for the baby from the time you get home from the hospital.  Welcome to parenthood\u2026 you sleep or shower when the baby sleeps.  You live on 2 or 4 hour cycles with the baby.  When the baby is asleep, you throw the laundry in\u2026 on the next cycle you put it in the dryer\u2026 etc\u2026 I was doing 1 load of laundry every day spread throughout the day.  It was easy that way.  When I went into the kitchen, I would do whatever I could do in that 5 or 10 mins I had\u2026 if it wasn\u2019t pressing, I rested.  You figure it out, this is training for being the parent of an older child\u2026 ha ha\u2026 you will look back on those first two weeks and wonder how you survived, and then when your kid is a sassy 5 yr old, you wish you could go back in time to when they were a sweet little baby just home from the hospital\u2026\n\nNo visitors for two weeks.  You need to find your voice.  You need to be polite but firm.  If you go into this wanting to be nice, your MIL will run roughshod over you and ruin the experience.  It\u2019s your baby, she raised hers.  You are the momma, and you get to decide who comes to your house and when and who gets to hold the baby and for how long.  Polite but firm, you will not let anyone take over taking care of your child\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s momma grizzly bear time\u2026 your baby is your bear cub\u2026\n\nYour MILs life purpose was raising kids.  That\u2019s bad.  Raising kids is a temp job that ends when the child becomes an adult, moves out and builds their own life.  Your MIL needs a hobby, because she wants to raise your baby, and she will do whatever and say whatever to play pretend momma with your child.  That\u2019s not her role.  Her role is to be the spectator and offer to help.  Your role is to accept or decline the help  depending on what you want to do.  She doesn\u2019t get a say.  It is clear she wants to take over, because she didn\u2019t ask you if you wanted her to come and stay, she told you she was coming to stay.  Grandparents defer to the parents and ask how they can help, and don\u2019t interfere when their offer is politely declined.  She is on a mission to play pretend mommy, and if you and your husband don\u2019t set some boundaries and consequences, she will ruin your experience, and there are no do overs.  You will remember this for the rest of your life.  FYI - my inlaws came for the first 3 days, mercifully they lived nearby and didn\u2019t stay.  By the 3rd day, I told my husband to tell them to not come back\u2026. Not as bad as your MIL, but annoying because there were always there and then wanted me to l play hostess for food.

You don\u2019t need this kind of \u2018help\u2019 the couple of weeks after you\u2019ve given birth. Can you imagine how that would be with feeding, sleeping, pain management, hormonal outbursts, etc? You don\u2019t want every crying jag told to everyone, or the embarrassing stories that will develop.", "as someone who has a MIL that is more or less the same, my heart goes out to you. \nhusband and i are little to no contact now. this type of behavior doesn't change and it's possible narcissism or her head is just that far up her ass. i'd suggest having your husband deal with communication solely going forward, she doesn't respect either of you and is trying to flip the script by making herself the victim. stick to your guns and focus your energy on that new bundle of joy.", "NTA\n\nThat would be a hard no. You do realise she is going to ignore every thing you say and post pictures of the baby on line  before you can?\n\nShe is not entitled to access to your baby. So her feelings are hurt (never mind she tramples all over yours) what she expects to come to yours and what you just hand over the baby.\n\nSo what if they gave you money for your house, you need to go LC no more info, no baby pictures I wouldn't even tell her when you are in labour or have the baby. You know she will just ignore your wishes.\n\nDoes your husband understand? Does he support you?", "OP, please don\u2019t allow them to ruin the first weeks of your bonding time with your new baby. This sounds like a train wreck waiting to happen. This situation is not going to get better unless you develop some strong boundaries.", "Nta", "This. Stop rolling over for this woman just because they helped you with a down payment. That doesn\u2019t give them the right to trample over your boundaries. Do not let this woman stay after birth and stop telling her stuff that you don\u2019t want all over Facebook. She isn\u2019t going to change so you need to put her on an information diet and stick to your boundaries."]}
