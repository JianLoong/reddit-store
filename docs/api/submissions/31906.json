I\u2019m using Galaprant for my elderly (11 years, 11 months) lab and she\u2019s responded wonderfully", "Right. OP isn\u2019t choosing between her siblings and her dogs. That would be true if she chose to pay for a boatload of dog bones instead of getting a gift for her siblings. She\u2019s choosing the health and basic comfort of one over gifts, which aren\u2019t really necessary. OP is definitely NTA. \n\nThat said, this is a potential teachable moment for her siblings. I love the idea of an experience gift instead. A movie night (if she can afford it, order a pizza or make tacos and/or put together a sundae bar, all of which you can do for pretty cheap and you have to eat anyway) or any inexpensive or free activity they enjoy doing together is going to make for great memories and may be cherished more than a random material gift.", "I grand pups doggie advent calendars and Christmas sweaters plus they are getting other gifts to open on Christmas morning.

I'm in the UK, and here, letting an animal suffer pain would be classed as \"causing unnecessary suffering\" under animal cruelty laws. When you take on a pet, you're agreeing to take responsibility for his or her welfare, as if they were your child. OP might not be literally the mother dog who birthed them, but she is in loco parentis.", "Just a reminder of the current cost of living crisis\u2026 \n\nOdds are that OP has had her dogs for years and money wasn\u2019t tight until the cost of everything has sky rocketed. Why would she put herself in/ on the brink of debt for a couple of presents? I\u2019d be mortified if any of my family bought me a present if it could impact their finances and/or living conditions. $20 to someone with a full bank account is nothing. $20 for someone that has a balance of $20 is everything. \n\nOP, your siblings understand, that\u2019s what matters. Reach out and spend some time with them, all they need is your love X", "I didn't read that as OP calling her aunt crazy, just that Auntie is seen as the crazy cat lady by Mum and Stepdad!\n\nAnyway OP, no you're NTA. You're being a responsible pet mummy, putting your babies first, and your brother and sister sound like impressively mature, unselfish kids. They must have had a good example in you, because it wasn't from their parents! They don't mind about material gifts, they just want to spend Christmas with their big sister.

They don\u2019t care about the gifts. Tell your sibs what you\u2019re doing so they buy you something pricy if they\u2019re the type to care if they give more than they receive. You show up with gifts in tow.

That way it's thoughtful showing that you pay attention to their likes and also cost effective.\n\nThat and if you can find them, throw in a few joke scratchoffs that \"win\" big amounts of money but are fake.

Even at 12, peers, teachers, and adults at spare time activities are as much, if not more, of an influence than a parent. This only grows more true as the child grows older.

I love making my presents look really fancy using various ribbons and paper but I hardly ever buy any of that stuff new and in season.

I'm sorry that in trying to do the right thing (notifying the teens ahead of time so they aren't bummed on Christmas) turned into something so horrible.", "Maybe bake something different to gift (while still baking the usual cookies) so that your family can\u2019t accuse you of just wrapping up something you were gonna bring anyway", "and get a lump of coal for your mom.", "Gift cards to a local theater, then the three of you can see a movie together after the holidays.", "Man, I LOVE it when my sister bakes.

A sleep over, movies and pancakes in the morning. Make sure you snuggle with your doggone and your siblings.", "Yeah! If they're close by, maybe you can get together and do something special or fun. A lot of Christmas gifts in my family are experiences or time spent together.", "If they live a little further, maybe they can spend the night as a \u201csiblings sleepover\u201d while they\u2019re on Christmas break from school.

I had an aunt with early onset Alzheimer's and my uncle was her primary caregiver for several years.

They are not toys!!!! Don't suggest this please. \n\nAgain, animals are not toys!\n\nShelters typically have policies in place to ensure the animal is going to a good home. The second you tell them the pet isn't for you but a surprise gift for someone else, they should stop the adoption process.", "I don't think that's what they meant, I read it as them saying to do it before Christmas (so the mom has choratmas day with them) and then agreeing with OP that it's not about gifts. \n\nBut I could be totally wrong.", "I was going to suggest this too. And maybe take the time to make a fancy \u201ccoupon\u201d or invitation  or something that you can physically wrap. And wrap nicely in a fancy box.
