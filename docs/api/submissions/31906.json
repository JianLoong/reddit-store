I also have two dogs (9F and 10F) who get a nice bone on that day. Yes, I'm aware my dogs don't know or care it's Christmas, I just like to treat them, especially on that day. \n\nAs the dogs are getting older, they're (as can be expected) developing health problems. Both have recently been diagnosed with osteoarthritis ; they have a treatment for it, but it's not exactly cheap.\n\nBecause of the cost of treatment, and because everything in general is getting pore expensive, I told my mom and siblings that I didn't have the budget for Christmas gifts this year; it was either paying for the treatments, or buying the gifts. \n\nMy sister was a bit disappointed but said she understood. My brother was fine with it as well. My mom however seems to think it's scandalous, she says she doesn't care about not getting a gift herself, but my siblings should take priority over the dogs. This is alarming to me since she has two pets herself and makes me think if/when they get health issues, she won't make them a priority.\n\nHer husband agrees with her (not surprised there, they always agree with each other when it comes to disagreeing with me) and my grandparents are saying I should skip treatment for the dogs in December in order to buy my siblings gifts. Only my aunt is on my side, but she's not-so-secretly considered a 'crazy cat lady' by my family, because at 52 she's single and childfree with three cats. \n\nI think it's crazy to ask me to compromise my dogs' health just to buy stuff for my siblings that they don't actually need. Especially since they'll be getting gifts from the rest of the family so it's not like mine would make much of a difference for them. They are also old enough to understand - and do understand, as evidenced by their reactions. \n\nMy mother is now threatening to uninvite me from Christmas Eve, which we usually spend together at her house, if I don't agree to get gifts for my siblings. They've tried to say it's fine, but it's not like my family is in the habit of listening to the children when they don't agree with the adults. \n\nSo many family members are against me that I'm starting to wonder if I'm actually the AH and crazy for putting the dogs first.", "created_utc": 1701171490, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185u1zv/aita_for_not_getting_christmas_gifts_for_my/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We owe it to them to get them the treatment they need, when they need it. It\u2019s what we signed up for.

You\u2019re definitely not the asshole and you shouldn\u2019t have to neglect your pets for them.

It\u2019s a bit ridiculous to be her age and be so materialistic. I\u2019ve never heard of shutting out your own child for Xmas due to their financial difficulties.

I never expect gifts from anyone but still give them but only to very close family & friends & do not worry if they do not reciprocate, by the same token they would not care if I did not give gifts either.  \n\n\nYour animals are your companions on a daily basis, their welfare should come 1st every time & if your Mother says you will not be invited to Christmas dinner it says more about her than you.  \n\n\nWe have cats & I would sell a kidney to get them treatment so you are not alone putting them first.", "Ask your mom this, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying, if given the choice, you would rather me leave my dogs in pain for the month so that I can buy something for you instead?\u201d\n\nNot a guarantee but it\u2019s possible phrasing it like that will get them off your back.

Your siblings will live without presents. You could give them something cheap and symbolic to show you care.\n\nThere is always going to be a difference in values between people who take their duty to their pets seriously and love them deeply, and those see a vast gulf between humans and pets to the point where a human's convenience is worth more than the pet's life.\n\nThis difference in values can't be reconciled.

Something (relatively) low cost that you can do with each of them. Separately if that seems like a better draw. Maybe swimming, a movie sleepover night, a day of baking. Think Big Sister fun days. \n\nKids are grateful for the memories and your siblings seem like they are good kids. Just because you are broke doesn\u2019t mean you need to skip a gift.

That could be the beach if you live close enough, or a park, a museum, there\u2019s all sorts of things you could do. You still have time before Christmas to come up with something.

If they don't come, at least you offered!", "That\u2019s a nice idea.", "I like this idea! Another option is, if you love semi-close, invite the siblings over individually to have a special sleepover- bake cookies or do DIY pizzas, watch their favorite movie, play video games (if that\u2019s their thing) and pop popcorn. Time is always a wonderful gift that will give them a great memory.", "Obviously you shouldn\u2019t incur any unnecessary debt but there\u2019s really know why you cant do anything nice for your siblings for Christmas? \n\nIt just seems odd that when making cute, Christmas gifts for kids is first on the list for cuts", "Agree with this. There\u2019s no reason OP can\u2019t get creative and do something low cost for their siblings. It can come with the explanation of \u201cI don\u2019t have the budget for buying gifts this year\u201d with the added (e.g.) \u201chow about a christmas movie night at my place instead?\u201d. Buy popcorn and make christmas paper chains together while watching a movie and you\u2019re sorted.", "Aaah! I saw this after I posted. This is what I was thinking too. A special hang out or sleepover with them individually. This only works if they live semi close but it would be a great gift if it is possible!"]}
