We were having a great time until it was time to go back home. I had driven us there with her Dads truck as she doesn\u2019t have her license. Jane had wandered off about 45 minutes before we were gonna leave, I figured she was just hanging out with other people. But in reality she had snagged the keys from me and took her friends on a joy ride, scratching the truck pretty bad. I obviously was very pissed, as her dad had trusted me with his truck. \n\nWhen she got back I told her I was gonna tell her dad what happened, she begged me not to, saying she\u2019d be grounded for a long time if he found out. I took the keys from her, and she at first refused to get in, saying she wasn\u2019t coming with me, but eventually did get in, begging me the whole 25 minute drive to her house to not tell her dad. \nWhen we got there it was around 1AM and everyone was asleep except for her Dad. She tried to block me from going in, but I just pushed her aside. I asked to speak to her dad privately and we spoke for about 20 minutes, about how she stole the keys from me when I was distracted and how she took it for a joy ride, scratching it very bad. I offered to pay for the repairs but he refused, saying it wasn\u2019t my fault. \nAfter we were done talking he pulled Jane into a room and started screaming\nat her about how could she be so irresponsible. He then said she was grounded for 4 months and had to use her job money to pay for the repairs (around 700$). \n\nAfter that her dad drove me home and\nthe next day she had blocked me on everything and gotten her friends against me, calling me all sorts of stuff online.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1675278315, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r2zj9/aita_for_getting_my_friend_grounded_for_4_months/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The scratches weren't going to disappear on their own.  Were you supposed to take the fall for her wretched judgment?", "NTA. You were honest and did the right thing. Sometimes doing the right thing isn't the easy way.", "NTA. People could have fucking died, I\u2019m almost certain her dad is more upset that she endangered people by joyriding his truck than he about the damages to it. Besides it\u2019s not your fault or liability to take the blame for damages on that truck.\nSo no NTA, your friend is lucky people didn\u2019t die, people in my highschool weren\u2019t so lucky when they pulled a stunt like this\u2026", "NTA You are not responsible. Jane is the one who took someone else's truck without permission which is car theft even in a family. She is the one who drove unsafely. She did it to herself. You did NOTHING WRONG.", "You are definitely NTA. If anything you were the most responsible person in this situation. She\u2019s young, naive and ignorant. This will be a huge learning lesson for her in responsibility. She has to understand that you have to be mature with other peoples belongings especially a car. She could have injured herself and her friends she took on the joy ride, she\u2019s lucky just the truck was damaged. It was rude of her to expect you to take the blame for her actions, and shows she\u2019s severely lacking in empathy and remorse seeing as she was more concerned with u not telling her dad, rather than feeling sorry for causing damage to his truck. She, however, has no right to be sending her friends after you. Maybe you should let them know how irresponsible and narcissistic she is. OP, you have demonstrated true responsibility even in the face of peer pressure, you will do wonderfully in this world. Good luck!", "NTA he would have blamed you", "NTA. She fucked around, she found out. Life lesson learned.", "NTA. Your friend committed a crime and wanted you to take the blame. How did she scratch the truck? What other property was harmed? She was driving illegally. Your friend needs to grow up. You were being mature and adult to have a conversation with her father.", "NTA\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes. \n\nShe is now learning that actions have consequences and it isn't your fault she screwed up. She doesn't seem to be much of a friend if she was willing to let you take the fall for her bad decisions.", "NTA.  You're better off not having a friend who is going to block you because you refused to accept consquences for her actions.  She stole the keys, she took the joyride, and she scratched the car.  She's the one who deserves the scolding and the financial burden.  Expecting her \"friend\" to take that on for her is next-level toxic.", "NTA. You didn't get her grounded, her being grounded is a direct result of her behavior - which, for the record, was both illegal and could have had far worse consequences - and she has to face that. The reality is that she wasn't a good friend to begin with if not only would she violate your trust by taking the keys in the first place but then expect that you would take responsibility for the damage she caused to the truck. You deserve better friends.", "NTA, people could have gotten hurt by your 'friends' actions and you did the right thing by telling the truth", "NTA - either you would have to take the blame for the damage or she did.  Pretty simple besides the whole illegal, dangerous and stupid part.", "NTA who knows what she would have twisted to put the blame on you. If you weren't honest then you would be responsible for the damage.", "NTA. You were responsible for the truck and for your friend, and things could have gone really, really badly when she took it out for a joyride; much worse than just some scratches on the truck.", "You did literally nothing wrong here NTA your friend sucks and is pretty crazy if she thinks you were just gonna take the blame for all the scratches she made.", "NTA. Kid, you can't be responsible for 700$ damage that you obviously didn't cause. And even if Jane is even younger than you, she can't make you take the responsibility. She's not 7 yo for f sake. Actions have consequences. Looks like it was a lesson she needed to learn badly. Let her block you all she wants. You don't want her\ud83e\udd37", "NTA. That's a shitty situation for you, I'm sorry. But you did the right thing, and your ex-friend will be a much better person in the future because of what you did. Actions have consequences, good on you for not taking the fall for those", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She needs to learn responsibility.", "NTA, be happy she blocked you she was not treating you like a friend.  A friend does not ask another friend to take the blame for a crime they did not commit.  She was happy to throw you under the bus.  Was she concerned about the impact it would have on your driving record?  Your insurance costs?   Your lost wages if you had to pay back the $700?   The trouble you would get in with your parents?  \n\nThe answer is a resounding no.  She only cared about herself.  You are better off without her.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI understand that you lost your friend over it and the grief that all of that will be.  But you did a responsible respectable thing.", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" tried to screw you over instead of owning her actions.", "NTA. You sound like a responsible teenager and you did the right thing, even if your friend isn\u2019t very happy with you right now. But you deserve to not be very happy with your friend either since it sounds like she was going to let you take the blame for her mistake.", "NTA he was going to find out either way, what you did was prevent her from putting the blame on you.", "NTA. Consider it a favor she blocked you, you really don\u2019t need her bullshit causing you any more drama. What? She wanted you to take the blame & pay for her dads truck that he was nice enough to let you drive? Hell no, you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nHer dad gave YOU permission to drive his truck. She was in the wrong at every turn, and she wanted you to lie about it and take the blame for her actions. You did the only thing you could do. You were honest with her dad about what happened. You went further and offered to pay for the damage since the car had been in your care.\n\nI hope this incident was character-building for your friend and she learns from it, but probably not since she's blocking and name-calling. You're lucky to be rid of her. She's bad news.", "NTA.\n\nJane is at fault, so she pays the penalty. Isn't she too young to be legally driving? What if a cop had stopped her? Would she and the others have ended up in jail?\n\nAnd wouldn't some of the parents blame you? Though I wonder how it was that she stole the keys. I'm sure she did, but was it something as blatant as sneaking into your purse?", "NTA. She wanted you to take the fall for her. That is not a friend. That is someone who does stupid shit but doesn't want to deal with the consequences.", "Your friend was perfectly willing to let you take the consequences of her actions. I wouldn\u2018t lose to much sleep over losing a friend with morals like that. You are most definitely NTA.", "ESH. Yes your friend is very much the a\\*hole BUT you are supposed to be her friend and you should have at least offered her the option to tell her dad herself, made it clear you were not gonna let this slide but offer her to be the one to take responsibility.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

How were you expecting the OP to explain away the scratches when the dad called in a fury?", "Did you read the post?", "do you know as to why she's doing that? Is there relationship especially strained? Is she afraid of her dad, or is it simply a strict parent situation?", "i completley agree that the friend the a\\*hole but I'm just saying, these are teenagers, sometimes clear communication is necessary. That being said, if offered the choice the friend most likely still wouldn't have confessed according to OP. So in that case OP would be completly NTA if they then would talk to the dad. \n\nI just think it's always a good idea to give people the chance to make things right first.", "her dad isn\u2019t that strict, she does it to seem cool towards her friends i think, but tbh idrk", "So if the friend talks to the dad first, and as a good parent believes his child, would you be fine paying $700 for damages you didn\u2019t do? Because that\u2019s where this is going, OP was responsible for the car and the friend would 100% pin the blame on her to avoid punishment.", "in that case, you're NTA. \n\nJust wondering, is this something she typically does and if so why are you friends with her?", "I originally became friends with her because our dads were friends and eventually over time she became like this", "yikes! \n\nare you still talking now? maybe she could profit from seeing your perspective.", "she has completely blocked me, i have tried texting her but nothing and i\u2019m not sure if i wanna go to her house", "NTA, I lost a cousin to a 14 year old joyriding.", "Nta. You behaved like an adult. She behaved like an irresponsible child.", "[removed]", "Absolutely NTA.  In high school, a friend of mine did this.  Just a joy ride at 15 in her parent's truck.  It ended up with her dead and her two brothers injured.  She rolled the truck, didn't have a seat belt on, and was thrown out.  The truck rolled over her.
