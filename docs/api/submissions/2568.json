Whenever that happened my parents would just mix my birthday with the holiday and no one in my family minded. Celebrating with my friends usually had to wait until the following week. My fianc\u00e9e \"Tiffany\" knows all about this. Last year we moved in together and started to celebrate holidays together. She wanted to have Thanksgiving at her parents' last year but, my birthday was also on Thanksgiving. Tiffany has this tradition with her mom, aunt, and cousin that they go to the closest city to do holiday shopping and have a girls' weekend the weekend after Thanksgiving. I agreed we'd spend Thanksgiving with her family, no birthday dinner until the following Monday since we'd be at her parents and it was up to them how it was handled, she could do her weekend but this year we'd celebrate with my parents. Tiffany was all on board with this compromise.\n\nThe plan has changed a bit. Her family wanted us to go to their house again and see my family before or after but we said no because my family lives almost 4 hours away. We offered to have Thanksgiving dinner at our house this year. Both families agreed. Tiffany and I agreed we'd do as my family did- we'd mix my birthday dinner with Thanksgiving since my birthday is the day after Thanksgiving this year. This way, I can celebrate with my family since they'd already be in town, no dealing with the Friday crowds, and Tiffany could still do her yearly girls' weekend with her family. My mom loved this idea and offered to come a day early to help us cook and add some of my favorite things to the menu and make a cake for me instead of extra pies.\n\nWe added nachos, homemade sushi, and a cake to the menu and took away some traditional turkey day stuff so it wouldn\u2019t be an insane amount of food. The staples are still there. We sent a list of what we\u2019d be serving to her family so they would know and her parents and aunts asked why there was \u2018party food\u2019 at a holiday dinner. We explained the situation and they raised a stink and said that Thanksgiving isn\u2019t about me or an appropriate time/place for a birthday. \n\nTiffany is starting to agree with her family and thinks they\u2019re right- the holiday should be about family and not making part of the holiday about me since my birthday is the following day and we should just celebrate my birthday the following week like last year. My view as I\u2019ve told her- I agree but I can\u2019t help when I was born. Us being a couple and getting married means we should be finding a way to handle this that works for the two of us, not other people. Tiffany and her parents are insisting it is a traditional Thanksgiving dinner.

Thanksgiving should be about the togetherness etc.  Considering you two are engaged and living together, her side of the family doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s going to be tolerant of anything that doesn\u2019t go according to what they like.
