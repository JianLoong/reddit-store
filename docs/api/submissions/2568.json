Whenever that happened my parents would just mix my birthday with the holiday and no one in my family minded. Celebrating with my friends usually had to wait until the following week. My fianc\u00e9e \"Tiffany\" knows all about this. Last year we moved in together and started to celebrate holidays together. She wanted to have Thanksgiving at her parents' last year but, my birthday was also on Thanksgiving. Tiffany has this tradition with her mom, aunt, and cousin that they go to the closest city to do holiday shopping and have a girls' weekend the weekend after Thanksgiving. I agreed we'd spend Thanksgiving with her family, no birthday dinner until the following Monday since we'd be at her parents and it was up to them how it was handled, she could do her weekend but this year we'd celebrate with my parents. Tiffany was all on board with this compromise.\n\nThe plan has changed a bit. Her family wanted us to go to their house again and see my family before or after but we said no because my family lives almost 4 hours away. We offered to have Thanksgiving dinner at our house this year. Both families agreed. Tiffany and I agreed we'd do as my family did- we'd mix my birthday dinner with Thanksgiving since my birthday is the day after Thanksgiving this year. This way, I can celebrate with my family since they'd already be in town, no dealing with the Friday crowds, and Tiffany could still do her yearly girls' weekend with her family. My mom loved this idea and offered to come a day early to help us cook and add some of my favorite things to the menu and make a cake for me instead of extra pies.\n\nWe added nachos, homemade sushi, and a cake to the menu and took away some traditional turkey day stuff so it wouldn\u2019t be an insane amount of food. The staples are still there. We sent a list of what we\u2019d be serving to her family so they would know and her parents and aunts asked why there was \u2018party food\u2019 at a holiday dinner. We explained the situation and they raised a stink and said that Thanksgiving isn\u2019t about me or an appropriate time/place for a birthday. \n\nTiffany is starting to agree with her family and thinks they\u2019re right- the holiday should be about family and not making part of the holiday about me since my birthday is the following day and we should just celebrate my birthday the following week like last year. My view as I\u2019ve told her- I agree but I can\u2019t help when I was born. Us being a couple and getting married means we should be finding a way to handle this that works for the two of us, not other people. Tiffany and her parents are insisting it is a traditional Thanksgiving dinner.

Thanksgiving should be about the togetherness etc.  Considering you two are engaged and living together, her side of the family doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s going to be tolerant of anything that doesn\u2019t go according to what they like.

I\u2019ve never liked \u201cthanksgiving\u201d food and often spent my bday in a car shuttling between relatives. You\u2019re not asking that people not mention the holiday and only celebrate your birthday- you\u2019re just getting your birthday acknowledged. Also, the \u201cnot technically the day\u201d argument is tired, lots of things are celebrated when it\u2019s most convenient. In a few years, your birthday will be on thanksgiving- how will they try to avoid celebrating it then? \nBesides, isn\u2019t celebrating a birthday about love and being grateful that these people are a part of your life? It\u2019s not a wholly dissimilar vibe. You\u2019re not even removing the classic Thanksgiving elements, merely adding a few personal touches!\nYou might want to have pie as well as cake though, since people love dessert and seem to hate change.", "NTA\n\nWhats more family oriented than celebrating a family members birthday? I find it a bit strange that they are so against it. I also think it sucks a bit that your fianc\u00e9e isn't supportive of your birthday celebrations.", "I would rather celibate your birthday than the slaughter of innocent natives. NTA", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9e and her family are being ridiculous. It\u2019s a family holiday, you aren\u2019t gate crashing on a wedding or someone\u2019s engagement party, baby shower etc.", "Hey, Nov 25 bday twins!!!", "NTA! My birthday is usually a few days after thanksgiving and we always did cake along with pies once we became adults. Your celebration, your rules! Happy birthday!", "Beautifully and thoughtfully expressed. Excellent advice. \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "\"I *am* family, and I'm thankful I was born!\"", "No, my parents will wind up leaving sooner than her parents since they live 4 hours away and my mom will be back to work on Friday whereas Tiffany's parents not only live in our town, but she and her family will wind up heading to their hotel Thursday night.", "My birthday has already fallen on Thanksgiving while celebrating with them- it wasn't acknowledged and we waited until the following week to celebrate it. So I already know how her family will handle it if we celebrate Thanksgiving solely with them. There will still be pies along with a cake so dessert bases are covered lol", "NTA. As families grow combining holidays and birthdays make sense.", "Oh I see - when I think of pilgrims and the first thanksgiving nothing comes to mind more than jalape\u00f1o poppers, mushroom caps, chocolate mousse, and peach cobbler.", "I agree with others.The menu you do have is fine. What your losing are either sides, desserts or appetizers for which there is plenty of coverage with similar enough stuff.\n\nHonestly, you could list what you are serving on the traditional list (without the stuff that was dropped) and most people would not say \"but what about X\". Or if they do, would come up with something their family does thats completely different. (eg. a baked squash, which my parents would occasionally do)\n\nI will say I am a little curious what you do for your stuffed mushrooms, because I've tried doing them a couple of times in recent years and can't decide if its the recipes or my execution that is falling short.", "So basically the \u201ccommon\u201d foods are being served, and the sushi, nachos and cake are all extra. It\u2019s ridiculous that they\u2019re putting up a stink. You\u2019re hosting, it\u2019s your birthday, and you are both bringing your family traditions together as a married couple. Her family needs to get over themselves, it\u2019s you and Tiffany making compromises for each other, not her family\u2019s way or the highway. SMH\n\nNTA, but her parents and aunts are.\n\nETA, you even compromised with celebrating your birthday so Tiffany can continue HER families weekend tradition. So it\u2019s actually just doing everything her family\u2019s way and omitting yours.", "I get cremini or button mushrooms with the stems. Take the stems out and chop them up really fine. Carefully scoop the mushroom gills out. Saute fine chopped green onion or shallots with some parsley and herbs. \n\nAdd bit of olive oil, salt and pepper inside the mushroom cap. Then mix panko, sautee mix, 1 egg, parmesan and mozzarela cheese. Stuff the caps, and use a baking sheet to bake them in the oven at 350 for about 20-25 minutes. The caps are a little soggy but the filling gets crisp and melty.", "I stuff portobellos with a mix of:\n\nsweet onion, finely chopped - sauteed until translucent (typically 1 large)\n\nchopped find portobello mushroom stalks (sauteed with the onions but added later) (one mushroom per person)\n\nroasted red peppers - chopped fine (1 or 2 bell pepper equivalents depending on how many people)\n\ntapenade (premade) ( quantity depends on how many but typically at least 30ml and to taste)\n\ncooked quinoa - typically 1 cup cooked to 4 portobellos\n\ncooked and drained and crumbled to bits sausage.  (2-4 sausages depending on size and how many I am feeding)\n\nfeta (preferably goat) crumbled fine - 250g typically - I like feta forward \n\nprecook ingredients and mix all - quantities are to eye and I use the leftover to stuff peppers or twice-baked potatoes.\n\nAdd salt and pepper to taste - also good additions are toasted cumin, mint, hot peppers (chopped fine and sauteed with onion and mushrooms), garlic etc.\n\nCoat portobello caps in olive oil all over then place on baking sheet with stem area/gills  facing up.  Coat with pesto sauce.  Fill with feta-quinoa mix.\n\nBake at 400 for 10-15 minutes until hot and getting that browning on the feta bits. I start checking at 10 minutes and then 2 minute intervals.\n\nEat and try not to burn the roof of your mouth off.", "It's more selfish to ask them to come again the very next day, when they're tired. What's not selfish is not wanting to postpone your birthday a whole week because you happened to be born during a holiday weekend. In fact the holiday weekend is perfect for celebrating a birthday because you have time afterwards to clean up.", "No it's not then it's their choice if they want to come and you're not ruining their holiday", "How is having cake and celebrating, ruining the holidays. It's OP's house, and if they want to have their birthday and thanksgiving at the same time then that's fine. They already compromised last year, it's not fair to force them to compromise again. If it ruins the holidays than they never really got the meaning of Thanksgiving in the first place.", "Birthdays are gift-giving occasions. You shouldn't have to feel compelled to get someone a gift just to attend Thanksgiving dinner it's tacky.", "Listen people can do whatever they want and throw another holiday on top of an existing holiday and say screw your traditions and what you believe a holiday is we're going to do what I want to. People do it all the time the person's asking if it makes them an ah and it does. \n\nI remember my one girlfriend she had her baby shower on Father's Day because it was convenient for her and then she got upset when people didn't come. \n\nJust bizarre to pick a holiday that people typically celebrate in a certain way and ask them to use it to celebrate a different type of celebration because it's convenient for you disregarding how they would feel.", "OP never said anything about expecting gifts, they just want to celebrate their birthday, and the whole point of Thanksgiving is to be thankful, so why not be thankful for OP's birth?", "It's not OP's fault they were born during that time, they aren't doing it out of convenience, but because their birthday is literally the day after.", "The only ones saying \u2018screw your traditions\u2019 is the fianc\u00e9\u2019s family.", "Birthdays are a gift-giving occasion that's just status quo. That's what people know when they're invited to celebrate someone's birthday.", "They weren't born on Thanksgiving this year they were born on the 25th that's the point", "Really previously he always celebrated his birthday every thanksgiving???", "NTA \n\nHBD in advance Op! \ud83c\udf89\n\nYou do you! Sounds like a great Thanksgiving and bday party! It all sounds delicious- wish I could come! Your leading lady needs to learn how to compromise and set up boundaries for her family. You are compromising lots for them.", "Lol nta but does if your wife cares more about what her family thinks then about you, your gonna have a fun marriage. This honestly makes me sad, thanks giving is about being thankful for your loved ones. What better way to show that then to push you to the side for what her family wants.", "NTA. Of course Tiffany is starting to agree with her family, watch out for that though who knows what issues may arise in her marriage and she will have her family back her up. Do what you want I mean you did her thing last year time for her to compromise this year.", "NTA .. thanksgiving is about being thankful for who you have in your life and what joy they bring to you and what you bring to others. .. not the menu.  If their idea of a traditional menu is more important than celebrating your gift of life in their lives.. then they are missing the point and no amount of cranberry sauce can change that. Shut that noise down with perspective.", "NTA but if you stay with this girl, don't try for kids in March! Heaven forbid the baby come on Christmas day and ruin her family's holiday!", "Sounds like they don\u2019t see you as family. Imagine if you had a December baby or a holiday baby. They\u2019ll either ignore the double standard or just not let the kid celebrate their day. NTA.", "Nta you compromise last year. This year your hosting you should be able to celebrate your birthday and Thanksgiving how you like it.", "NTA. You and your family have your traditions, her and her family have theirs. When you become a couple you need to compromise and make your own traditions. It's only fair for you to spend Thanksgiving with your family this year since you spent it with her family last year and seems you're including her (and her family) on your celebration tradition this year (happy birthday!). And you're agreeing to her girls shopping trip as well.  As you said, you can't help when you were born. And really you're leaving out a lot of the \"traditional\" thanksgiving foods (I'm making lasagna) so I don't know where they come off being put off on the menu. If they don't like it they can do their own thing (as long as GF supports you and shows up for your celebration).", "NTA if they want a different Thanksgiving than the one their gracious hosts are providing, then they can not attend. But y'all are hosting. So they're the ones being extremely, egregiously rude.", "So I guess OP isn't allowed to have a birthday at all when it falls on Thanksgiving. There is zero reason why they can't both be observed the same day.  Why should OP have to postpone his birthday just to mollify the future in-laws? The menu certainly covers all of the basics of the holiday, and just adds a few fun things in.  If that's not good enough, they can spend it at their own home. \n\nOP is NTA", "First of all that sounds awesome. My birthday is the day before yours and falls on T-Day sometimes too. (Lile this year!) I think your family is crazy and because you are family you should have a say too. One side of my family is traditional while another does something different every holiday so when it's my turn to host one day I plan on meeting in the middle with some fun birthday twists of course.", "NTA - nothing wrong with celebrating multiple things at a family gathering. Half the time you are sitting around doing nothing, so celebrate the Birthday!", "I agree with this. \n\nThis is your home, to have your traditions. Do it your way."]}
