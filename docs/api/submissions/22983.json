Had my parents not done that, but instead blocked porn, I would never ever have gone to them for any advice, or any sex related talk, and would have always figured out everything myself secretly.

It's ok for the homeowners to leave restrictions in place. It's their house, not a hotel. Depending on the methods used, it can be a pain to reestablish all the blocks once the horn dog leaves. He can use his phone, as has been said. \n\nA man, or woman, that can't live without porn for a weekend needs to have a hard look at themselves. \n\nThen again, OP may want to make sure brother doesn't leave any special reading material behind..... \n\nNTA, just to be clear.", "OP, you\u2019re being a really good parent. I was exposed to porn pretty young like around 12 and it messed me up a bit for a time period. It\u2019s easy to find really hardcore stuff nowadays.

You never know what effects stuff like that can have on young minds. It's not worth the risk.", "I also have to question what else they're blocking. If you're manually blocking sites, that sounds exhausting, if you're using a program it's probably blocking other things that aren't porn.\n\nAs a teen I had to have the awkward conversation of getting the blocker off my phone whenever I had a new phone because they block too much. It blocked deviantart which is an art website but also just where I uploaded my art homework. It blocked lolita sites, because of the association with the book, but all I wanted to do was look at pretty frilly dresses.\n\nDon't think you're an asshole at all though. Well done for protecting your kids! Just something to be aware of - there may be genuine reasons why guests get annoyed and eventually your kids might get frustrated too when they start to explore more hobbies.", "Jesus \u2026 that poor man couldnt jerk of in your house for a whole weekend. Where is your heart lady???", "Nta but honestly you should look into acces to porn when your kids are a bit older. I don't know enough about the subject (as in the effect of porn on children). If for nothing then for feeling left out. \n\nAgain you brother is a dick and all but there may (and again I am not sure) a grain of truth to what he said.", "It is perfectly normal to block adult content for kids this age. NTA, and it sounds like your brother is addicted to porn, if he can't live without it even for a few days.", "Wow. NTA. Brother can\u2019t even have a few days away from his adult content? What an AH to suggest you are a bad parent. Your youngest is 5!!!!!", "Guy wants to cum. He is pathetic.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. He has other options for places to stay if he can't live without it.", "Bro is says p*rn is \"real world\", he's def not getting laid", "excuse me sis, can you please unblock the corn so I can proceed and jerk off at your house as if this isn\u2019t a completely disgusting request?", "NTA \n\nI'm a bit confused. If he's an adult, he can pay for data. He can turn off his WiFi and use his data to watch his porn. Why should you have to pay for his needs?", "NTA your brother has a serious addiction if he can\u2019t go 1 weekend without watching porn", "NTA\n\nYour house, your rules. Also, your rules seem pretty appropriate and responsible. That being said, I can't imagine having such a restriction since I grew up on horror and gore. Porn was something I definitely explored as a charged teenager well into adult life but I don't believe it matters if I didn't have access to it, it's not like it's an interest you discuss with your peers.", "NTA and if someone chooses to enter your house and dictate your house rules, surely they are uninviting themselves from any future visits", "NTA. You are a good mother.", "Wait, your brother thinks you're a helicopter parent for preventing your 5, 7, and 11 year old children from internet pornography, and they won't going to be ready for the real world because they can't view porn?\n\nHoly crap!  Does he even believe what he's saying, or would he say any irrational, bizarro thing to get your to remove your filters so he can watch porn when visiting you.  I'm not sure which is worse.\n\nAnyway, continue to protect your children (this assumes you don't think The Little Mermaid is porn) and ignore your brother.\n\nNTA", "NTA I have kids of similar ages and we have a similar system running. Your Brother has a weird outlook on life if he feels denying pre-teen children porn is detrimental to their development. \n\nAlso slightly worried that I noticed he\u2019s visiting for a weekend and can\u2019t cope without access to porn, especially it seems as if he was badgering you for access after being there less than a day.", "The blue balls on this guy to admit to you that he's looking at porn in one of your beds while he's staying over. Sounds like it was a good idea.", "Sounds like he has a porn addiction to me NTA", "if the story is exactly as you told it? NTA\n\nIf you're changing details, or misrepresenting him? If twitter is what you consider inappropriate? If yo've blocked all streaming sites? If the only whitelisted sites are youtube kids?\n\nI say this because you sound exactly like my family members who block everything coming in but yahoo mail & disney+, and age gate it at under 6 for their 12-year-olds, and this is how they would describe it to strangers (esp the \"sex-ed\" part, which is... what is that?). Suuuuper suspicious story. I think everyone might suck here", "Those blockers are useless against a VPN. if they want to look at those sort of things they will find a way. I figure if they can figure that out they can look at it.", "dude is advocating for a 5-year-old to be allowed access to porn. \"won't be ready for the real world\" Porn is not the real world, that's such a strange angle to take. NTA", "NTA your bro is mad cause he wants to beat his meat in your house. That's a strange level of audacity.", "NTA, does he really need to watch porn or better yet, CONFRONT you about not being able to?! \n\nIf he can\u2019t go a weekend without he needs help.", "NTA.\n\nAlso does he not know how to disconnect from the WiFi to use his data to watch his films?", "Any reasonable person would just have shrugged, closed their eyes and used their imagination. If you're so dependent on porn that you can't jerk off without a video playing in front of you, you have a serious problem.", "I don\u2019t, my husband does it as I\u2019m not really great with that stuff, but it\u2019s done with a mix of blanket restrictions (automatically filtering banned content) and also blocking certian keywords and if something isn\u2019t being blocked for some reason then manually blocking the URL. Sorry I can\u2019t be more helpful in explaining, I\u2019m not great with technologies", "They are providing WiFi, just not access to porn. Which is fair, why would a guest in your house wanna watch porn while there? That's just weird.", "When my kids are 18 I will allow them to watch whatever 18 plus content they like, however it will not happen in my home partially because of younger siblings and partially because me and my husband are simply not comfortable with that happening in our home", "Fellow IT person here, please stop being an entitled AH. There have been situations in my life where something like this has happened to me and I could have done something similar, but you need to have respect for other people and their property.\n\nAlso just to check, you\u2019re not saying you would do this in a home with restrictions in place mainly for children, are you?", "I appreciate your judgement, but I do have something to say about what you\u2019re saying about my husband.\n\nMe and my husband both decided on these restrictions, when my oldest was around 4 and got his first iPad we both had a conversation, this was just as much my idea as it was his. I understand maybe you like to watch porn, but please don\u2019t make the assumption everyone else does.\nI understand lots of people, particularly men, watch porn, but it\u2019s hardly naive to assume my husband would actually say if he was watching this or had an issue with it being blocked.\n\nAgain, I appreciate your judgment, but please don\u2019t pretend like you know my husband or what he watches better than myself, and please don\u2019t call me naive for trusting him", "The data in my area is pretty poor, I\u2019ve never been sure why but I think it\u2019s because of the area where I live, part of the reason he was so upset is because he couldn\u2019t use mobile data easily to get to this stuff", "People who are rude always say they are either blunt or just truthful", "I'd say it is not \"little\" weird, I'd say if full speed weird and concerning.", "I\u2019m not from the states either, but I\u2019m 100% confident to say that internet porn is not the way for kids to get sex education. Much of it depicts sex in unrealistic ways, using actors with bodies that are outside the norm, and there\u2019s a lot out there that\u2019s violent and/or misogynistic. Masturbation is normal and should never be shamed. Wandering the wilds of the internet to find porn at 11 years old? Not a good idea.", "Not my business. Again, I never said OP can't block wifi in his home, just that you really should tell a guest before they travel to a remote location without cell service.", "Fair. Good luck.", "Perhaps he should go old school and purchase a magazine.", "Was exposed to porn at a young age as well and can 100% back this up. It can absolutely mess with you and blocking it is totally reasonable", "There is a theoretical argument that curated porn might be good as part of sex ed - scenes showing consent, mutual respect, realistic situations, etc. However the whole concept is fraught. The US can't even manage contraception education in many schools because abstinence is the only approved message.", "I strongly disagree.", "Based on what I know it only blocks adult content, I have tested it and it doesn\u2019t seem to block anything else. I appreciate the feedback and I\u2019ll definitely check and make sure nothing age appropriate is being blocked", "What I mean is, in most cases, it's weird and gross to pleasure yourself in someone else's house. You just don't do that. So you have no need for porn, so no need for access to porn sites. OP isn't committing some huge hospitality no-no by not giving her guests access to porn.", "Either way, I don\u2019t see a sensible argument for setting preteens loose on the internet to discover porn at will. Or - to get back to OP\u2019s original post - anything wrong with parents taking control of what content their kids are exposed to."]}
