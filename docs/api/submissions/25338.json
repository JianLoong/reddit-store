Younger women on the other hand, are less experienced which means these older men can feel comfortable acting less mature.\n\nThis is reinforced by the fact that this man has chosen to date a 19 year old, and then is complaining that this 19 year old acts like a teenager. Her brain won't even be fully developed for another 6 years.\n\nNTA. \n\nI think good friends hold their friends accountable. Trust me as a man in his 30's - people who do not get held accountable for their actions and words will fail to improve. Better that he gets this wake-up call now than when he's in his 30s. \n\nAt the same time, maybe you should re-evaluate your ideas of maturity.", "nta. he sounds really disillusioned. Is anyone forcing him to date her? what is he complaining about, that a barely 19 teen is not the same as a 26 year old likely career holding adult? \n\nHe was probably enamored by how young her appearance looked, and didn\u2019t consider anything else. She was probably interested because hes probably more mature and well off then boys fresh out of highschool like her. they are easily impressed and impressionable. sounds gross just typing it. \n\nIts very clear they wouldnt have anything in common. Its very clear hes probably not in it for the right reason. \n\nmy opinion is: Being a good friend means ALWAYS telling the truth. Ppl hate hearing the truth. ppl will suggest you should lie and just talk poorly behind their back like everyone else. Nope. don\u2019t be shitty like everyone else. Be kind, but always be willing to tell your friends the hard truths. He will realize you are right eventually. Just dont be hurtful about it.", "NTA - what did he expect from a 19 year old?", "NTA, I hate it when you warn someone about a mistake someone is making but they do it anyway.

As a person on the receiving end of a wake-up call from a friend when I was in my 20s I can say, looking back, it was helpful in the long term.

But your opinion is fair, though. I think where you were the AH is that you played the 'I told you so' game with someone who was clearly excited about having finally met someone he thought he'd get on with who upon further contact found that actually she is not as mature/doesn't have the same interests as he does. He was probably looking for some support, some 'Ah man, that sucks!' and 'I'm sorry, it seemed like you really liked her', and instead all you did was 'I told you she was too young' and 'What were you expecting with her being a teenager' and pushing him to break up with her.\n\nYou were a bad friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm with OP, people who choose to date significantly younger than them (6 years will be nothing soon, but right now it's 1/4 of his life and 1/3 of hers, that's significant) don't get to complain about their partner's immaturity.", "You might want to suggest he reads Adult Children Of Emotionally Immature Parents.. that kind of upbringing will have a serious effect on his adult relationships that he may not recognise without an outside perspective. NTA", "I may have been exaggerating a bit, but its not the most uncommon thing to fetishize 18-19 year olds. I feel like the difference in a fresh out of highschool 19 year old and 25 year old potentially post college in a career man is a pretty huge difference. \n\nI only made the appearance comment because now that all hes doing is complaining about her personality and interests, it seems obvious he didn\u2019t actually know much about her when he decided he was interested. Seems like a safe assumption he was into her for other reasons.", "I'm glad his friends put the kibosh on it either way.  Even though I'm not sure \"looking young\" played into it, \"acting young\" might have. Like finding basic, totally normal things about him attractive that women his age would just consider the bare minimum (self sufficiency, job and some money, basic literacy about adult topics like how to use public transit or rent an apartment or write a resume, etc.) If he's insecure about dating, this might have initially been appealing until he realized the flipside was that she was \"childish\". \n\nOverall, good on his friends for being like \"bro, there's no need to be that desperate\"", "Sorry you do understand you just said he\u2019s not lacking self awareness while also confirming he\u2019s going for barely-adult women yes??\n\nIt\u2019s ok to hold our friends accountable as you did.", "It's right on the border of the old divide by 2 add 7 rule", "yes that\u2019s definitely it!! \ud83e\udd22 I find it sort of gross when older people desire naivety, inexperience, and the ability to be easily impressioned in a young non-financially-independent partner, always a major \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9no matter how much ppl defend it. \n\nI agree, glad his friends seem decent and normal compared to many of the creepy men that exist in the internet and how the might encourage it lol", "NTAH Why should you have to keep your mouth shut while he complains? Either he shuts up too or he listens to your opinions.", "NTA. thats the same age difference and my bf and i, except we met at 21 and 27 which you wouldnt think is super different at 19 (her age) but really is. We both had more adult behaviors and day to day activities. We would NOT have gotten together if I met him at 19 because I was still just smoking weed and driving around w friends at ass oclock", "NTA he chose to date someone that's still basically a teenager. (Creepy) He whines when the child acts like a child..... He needs to grow up and stay away from kids..... Therapy would do him wonders", "I don't think I'd call you an asshole, but no one likes to hear I told you so. Unwanted relationship advice isn't much better.", "He also may be looking for someone that is an escape from his reality.  His brother\u2019s behavior is draining physically and emotionally.  He may be looking for someone who is out to have fun and not have to deal with hard questions about life or intrusive questions about his family.  I think you could have been kinder.  It\u2019s hard enough to function in his home environment, let alone participate fully in a romantic relationship.  It sounds like he needs support in other areas in his life, maybe not giving up his life for his parents and his brother.  Then maybe he will be in a place to have a healthy romantic relationship.", "NTA. Good on you for giving him the dose of reality he seems to desperately need.", "Nta", "NTA.   Your pal is super creepy dating a teenager at 25 years old.   This is always a sign that women his own age can see through all his bullshit so he picked an easier target.", "I dated a guy only 4 years older than me when I was 19 and he definitely only used me for sex i was way too immature compared to him. Cant help but feel your friend is doing the same thing. NTA", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t be surprised about the things he\u2019s noticing.", "NTA - you were right from the beginning, it is an age gap, and while it probably works for some couples, it is too big a gap for many. He\u2019s at a whole different place in his life, and you warned him that might cause tension.\n\nNow he\u2019s shocked that a 19 yr old is behaving her age and also just not into his interests as much as he wanted. Sounds like they should break up lol he probably just doesn\u2019t wanna be single again.", "NTA the girl probably had her prom a year ago, and your friend probably has his bachelors or some semblance of his career sorted. Hell he\u2019s been legal to drink for 4 years and she still has 2 to go.", "Sooooo NTA!", "Your buddy sounds a bit difficult to me. NTA", "Should\u2019ve kept the opinion to yourself, but you were right, he doesn\u2019t have a right to complain.", "I was angry at my friend, but it made me think and eventually I realized they were right.", "I feel like you can definitely tell the difference between a 25 year old and a 19 year old unless one is actively trying to look closer to the other age. Judging from OP's comments, though, he seemed to be into the \"young vibes\" he never really got to have at her age. Seems like a bit of a quarter life crisis to me.", "It's definitely not trivial, it's a huge factor to consider because usually they'll be at 2 different points in their life with different priorities and values, but it's not always like that. I don't think 25 & 19 is inherently unacceptable but in some situations it is for sure"]}
