Recently I\u2019ve applied for child support as I\u2019ve finally gotten fed up with Brett\u2019s inability to be a father, the guys never had a job, never made an effort to be a dad. At first I thought it was depression and throughout our relationship I got him into therapy and I cared for him as we were both teenage parents and it was hard for both of us. \n\nHis mother however told him to stop going to therapy as it was not because pf depression but because he was physically incapable of raising a child and I had to understand that because of his ADHD he couldn\u2019t do it. I endured this as I did love him and wanted to get him away from this, we made plans to move out and get our own place, his mother heard of this and stated that he needed her and he couldn\u2019t live independently due to his disabilities the guy has ADHD and Asperger syndrome but when his mother isn\u2019t around he\u2019s great and fathers just fine. \n\nThen the phone problem started, he got an iPhone mid 2020 and became attached to it, he started locking himself in his room and watching YouTube all day. I tried to get him out and help him but he refused and once again his mother made excuses for his behaviour. September rolls around and I leave, there\u2019s an uproar from his mother but not a word from him. His mother abusing me saying I\u2019m a horrible person for leaving and now he won\u2019t get any time to be a father because of me. I stated I\u2019m open to visits as long as he makes the effort to see him I don\u2019t ask for anything else other than some effort to be put in for his son. \n\nI get nothing unless I make the effort, once I stopped doing that due to work the abuse started up again. Fast forward to now, my son loves my boyfriend he\u2019s such a great guy and has a good bond with my son as well and makes me feel so special I\u2019ve never felt love like this before. I made the decision to apply for child support and I\u2019ve been getting non stop harassment from his mother saying things like \u201chow dare you exploit my son for his money\u201d mind you I don\u2019t get a dime from him so much as a word. \n\nI blocked her and I\u2019m ignoring her, I received a message from Brett saying he felt hurt and betrayed and asked why money is so important to me and that our son should come first. I was angered by his accusation that I don\u2019t put my son first but now I\u2019m wondering if I really was wrong to apply for child support. \n\nI have a good job and my boyfriend and I are financially stable so money isn\u2019t an issue I just wanted support  seeing as he can\u2019t step away from his mother and realise how controlling she\u2019s being. What ever money I receive will be put away for my child as that\u2019s HIS MONEY and I have plenty of my own. So AITA?\n\n(Also added paragraphs is this better?

He needs to take 50% custody of his child or pay the child support for his child. That's how the world works. You have a child, you support him by raising him or paying someone else to.", "NTA.  It is ironic that the guy who does nothing is accusing you of not putting your child first when you ask for child support.   The child support is putting your son first.   You can set the money aside for college,  for a rainy day fund,  or any other number of things if you do not need the money to feed your son right now.

He needs to grow up and financially support his child even if he can't figure out how to parent. \n\nAsking for child support is also a good strategy for preventing Brett and his crazy mother from getting their hands on Troy. If Brett would like to get out of paying child support, he could give up his parental rights.

You're creating an opportunity for him to support his son. Period. You don't have to justify how you spend it. He doesn't justify to you how he spends his money and time when NOT with your son.", "NTA \"He feels... our son should come first\"\n\nThat's exactly why he should be more than happy to pay child support. Ask him why he doesn't love his son enough to put him first.  Don't you dare feel guilty for demanding the resources that are rightfully owed to your child. If he doesn't like it I'm sure mommy will pay it for him.", "NTA. You\u2019re not wrong for filing for support, but not sure how much, if any, you\u2019ll be able to get.

Can\u2019t bleed a rock, right?", "NTA\n\nIf he believes that your son comes first then he would be willing to pay child support. The money is not his as it is necessary for raising your son. It takes two to create a child.

Get the money your child deserves.", "This is hilarious! He accuses you of not putting his child first yet doesn\u2019t parent and doesn\u2019t pay?? Beyond laughable.

Keep doing what you\u2019re doing because you\u2019re doing amazing! \n\nNTA, good on you for going after what you and your child are entitled to.", "NTA. It saddens me that young people today have to wonder if they are jerks for asking a parent they are no longer with to provide financial support for a child that they are primarily taking care of. Regardless of whether you're a mother or a father, if you have sole custody of a child, the other parent is still financially responsible for half of the cost that it takes to provide for that child.", "NTA. He should be paying child support because he is the parent. That is his responsibility.", "You're obviously entitled to apply for child support, but why did you? If you have plenty of money, were your motives wholly pure? I'm not on your ex's side, he's irresponsible, immature & should pay up, but you should be honest with yourself.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut damn you need paragraphs.", "This can't be a legit AITA.

You are putting your son first. Kids cost money and the deadbeat dad needs to contribute. You're doing the right thing mama. Good on you.", "NTA for applying for child support. I\u2019d advise you talking to relationships Australia about their mediation program as well given that you\u2019re keen to look at arrangements for care for your son. It\u2019s means tested and can also give you other options to explore. \n\nThe family court process here holds that children have rights - and parents have responsibilities. There are also options to support parents who have disabilities to be more active in their children\u2019s lives (eg Child First). \n\nI\u2019d add: Given that you\u2019re in Australia he would be eligible for the NDIS on the basis of his disabilities (ASD, ADHD). If he is interested in wanting to play a role in parenting (even if it\u2019s visitation and not 50/50 or whatever split custody arrangements you make) then this could be part of his goals for NDIS and he could get support with parenting and skill building in this regard.", "NTA. He made a kid with you. Unless he's in a mental institution or dead, he should be paying. Unless you and your bf get married, and he legally adopts your child.", "NTA, I would use the texts from his mother and try get a restraining order against her as she sounds crazy.", "NTA but I'd offer another solution.  If he doesn't want to pay child support then tell him to sign away his parental rights. That way when you meet a man who wants to step up and be your sons dad, the deadbeat biodad won't be in the way. He isn't a great father if he isn't providing maintenance for his son. He sounds like an okay babysitter at some points according to you but certainly not a father. The only person to think of here is your son. It is his job to provide as the father, has he done that? No.", "He\u2019s got NDIS, his mother is his carer she doesn\u2019t make an effort to help him cope with his disabilities and take him to things the NDIS provide so that it helps people like him live independently. He also refuses to improve himself it\u2019s tiring and it comes down to plain laziness on both parties.", "And if not your bf seems to be a good fatherly person in your son's life. Better another man being there than always being disappointed in bio dad", "So much better to read. Thanks.", "Just so you know, paragraphs don\u2019t have to be 4-5 sentences; that\u2019s more of a standard for compulsory schooling years (I\u2019m in the US so that\u2019d be elementary/middle/high school). If you go on to choose to get a degree, the standard for papers is more close to 6-8 sentences. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with not getting a degree by the way- I got one but make much more money in a field that doesn\u2019t need it.\n\nAs one young mother to another, I\u2019m very proud of your choices and maturity in having to put feelings aside in order to do the best for your child. I was about 2 years younger than you when I just *had* mine, and while I did get my shit together, I was nowhere near as well planned out as you. \n\nI\u2019m so happy for the family you\u2019re making and wish you all the best.", "Ahh.. that\u2019s such a shame. There\u2019s no clear reason that with independent support he can\u2019t be living independently etc and actively participating in the work force (even in a supported disability workplace). Sorry to hear that. Best of luck with everything - sounds like his mother is a difficult one\u2026..", "NTA. You seem like a very mature young mother.

You are literally putting your sonn1st by asking for the money to RAISE HIM. Demand as much as you can from this dude. NTA.", "NTA\n\nCustodial parents should always request child support. It's the child's money, not the parents.", "NTA for the stated question, but you do hit a lot of the tropes.  Clingy mil, deadbeat dad, neurodivergence, child pregnancy, asking if it\u2019s ok to ask the father to help with money. So kudos, I guess. This very much feels like fiction. If it isn\u2019t, then you have your work cut out for you in developing some assertion. Of course Brett should be helping pay for the things his child needs. Enforce that through the courts if you have to. You are also wrong. Child support is for the support of the child. Not to be hoarded. Your child needs new shoes, pay for them with support money. He needs new clothes in general, or a set of books for learning? Child support money. He\u2019s a fussy eater and you can only get him to eat more expensive food? Bust out some of that child support money. Sure, if you are loaded and you really don\u2019t need it, then yeah, get it into a fund for college. But in all these cases, Brett does not get to tell you that he doesn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t have to contribute.", "Girl you\u2019ve been doing too much for him. Go after the child support. If he can\u2019t his mother can pay it.", "HE MADE A KID, HE PAYS FOR IT. YOU MADE A KID, YOU PAY FOR IT. As easy as that. Dont need to money? Save it on a bank for your kid later, he/she will be grateful (dont tell them its their dads money, since it IS the kids money). Its not a gender thing, the only reason woman get a second choice for abortion is because birth is fukin brutal and can kill. Shouldnt influence the paying tho, I mean woman who go through birth but the father gets the child (like most fathers who actually fight before court) also have to pay child support.", "NTA because you are entitled to child support.\n\nThe only bit I hesitated at was the last paragraph: \"I just wanted support seeing as he can\u2019t step away from his mother and realise how controlling she\u2019s being.\"\n\nIt sounds like you were codependent and caretaking him during your relationship. Maybe you DO know best and better than his mother, but you are still impressing your need to control/caretake. He may need this lesson, sure, but it's not your job to teach him lessons anymore. You see this potential in him, and your goal is to make him \"better\" and motivate him. It's not your job to make him \"realize his mom is controlling\". It's so sad having to give up on someone because potential vs reality.\n\nHmm. Like I said NTA but maybe evaluate your motivation and try to distance yourself from that. Ideally he would be a father to his son; but despite his potential it doesn't seem like in reality he can be.", "NTA. He's the father and needs to support him. Children eat food,need to be kept warm and housed. As a parent that's part of the job.", "NTA. Of course not. That\u2019s his kid and he needs to maintain him. Period. You should ask for back child support too.", "So NTA as others have said you are legally entitled to child support however with that stated since you are having conflicting feelings about this I would suggest seeking the advice of a lawyer who specializes in family law in your state. The reason for this recommendation is that a child support order is a very serious thing and if the child\u2019s father is unable to pay what is ordered by the court there could potentially be legal consequences for him in the future up to and including jail time depending on state law where you reside. You have stated the child\u2019s farther has several diagnoses including ADHD and that he is on the Autism spectrum and while these may or may not prevent him from maintaining regular employment going forward you have stated he has a history of not being able to maintain steady work. You said you are not in financial hardship and that the money is to be put aside for your son which is entirely legitimate that said take a moment to reflect on the possible consequences to your relationship with son in the future if his father ends up incarcerated for failing to pay child support that was not needed for day-to-day care. Just a something to consider", "NTA, like not even a little bit.  He needs to do his share for this child.  He's made this baby too.  I kinda laughed at him saying he's hurt.  Dude, really?! You're feeling are hurt because you're being asked to assist in the well being of your own child?! My goodness \ud83d\ude06 I'm happy you're doing well other than this but you most definitely are NTA", "\"our son should come first\" Yes, that's why you need child support so your child can be provided for.\n\nNTA", "NTA but are you sure this is the route you want to go? Perhaps terminating his parental rights would better serve you. I suggest you see an attorney.", "NTA flop his words onto him. Why does keeping money matter to him more than providing for his son?", "NTA, do it for your son. Even if you don't want, or need it, your son deserves that money. Save EVERYTHING his mom sends you and file a restraining order. Get an actual lawyer for visitation, this isn't a game and there's nothing wrong with getting professional help.", "NTA. You are putting your child first by holding his father financially responsible for him.  Make sure you save all the text and messages you get from him", "NTA. I'm autistic, have ADHD, and still deal with the aftereffects of a Traumatic Brain Injury from almost ten years ago. I live by myself, get disability benefits, and work part-time. I have been a loving relationship for 7.5 years. Your ex is an AH and so is his mother.", "I get what you\u2019re saying here but I don\u2019t think this will have the intended effect with your son and his relationship with his father. Once your son grows older and turns into an adult with his own opinions, he isn\u2019t going to see his father being forced to pay child support as anything noteworthy for their relationship. The only thing that is going to make your son not resentful of his father is if your ex willingly spends time raising him and shows a desire to be a part of his life. The money is not going to matter to your son at all and, if anything, it\u2019s going to make him resent his father more if he finds out that your ex was forced against his will to contribute financially without actually being there. While you are fully within your rights to do this, I think you should take a step back and really think about why you\u2019re doing this and what outcomes it\u2019s going to have for everyone involved. You have already stated that you are financially comfortable and that you don\u2019t need the money. However, by doing this you are going to be putting financial stress on your ex, tying yourself and your families (yes that includes his mother) legally, and potentially worsening your inter-parent dynamic. You need to figure out whether this is really worth it for the potential outcomes. I don\u2019t think this really is going to do anything for your son\u2019s opinion on his father though so if that\u2019s the only reason then I would say it\u2019s not worth it.", "I think the important thing with child support is not the amount, it's the fact you're making him take some responsibility, and if he cant/won't it's documented. Mainly so that if he refuses to pay or doesn't you have a paper trail, incase his psycho mum tries to take you to court for custody, or encourages him to take you to cpurt. \n\nPlus, it shows you are trying to get your sons father involved in his life any way you reasonably can. All important things to have documented when dealing with difficult family members.", "Just be glad you don\u2019t need his money to get your child food because your poor baby would starve with such a \u201cfather\u201d. It does not matter if you need the money or not. It is something your child deserves (by law). I hope he will realise sooner or later (probably never) that he is the only one not thinking about his son. Oh and his mother as well. She is a bad influence and setting her own child up for failure in life. NTA OP.", "Be careful, I'm in NZ and we have a similar system. Child support is for living costs and to support them whilst they are growing up. Any savings you put aside for your son need to come out of your personal income, not child support payments. \n\nAlso accepting child support will also mean if he wants you have to provide your ex with fair and reasonable access to your child, yes he has rights regardless but by accepting child support it kind of gives him a easy foot in the door. Unless of course you can prove your child would be put in harms way by doing so. You need to get a custody/parenting agreement in place asap no matter what, especially because of his mother.", "If you're in Australia, I'm really surprised you haven't got child support already. If you're claiming Centrelink FTB, the amount you receive can be reduced if you don't have an active case with Child Support. \n\n\nNTA, not only do both parents need to take financial responsibility, but if you don't seek child support payments you're actively disadvantaging yourself!", "If you manage to get \u00a320pw then you'll have a hefty amount of savings to start your child off in life. You may end up with somewhere around \u00a315k which could help towards housing deposits. \n\nWhen you set it up, make sure to put the savings in a child account, you get extra interest, atleast you would if you were in the UK.", "Part of being a good parent is worrying about failing your child.  It means you are taking steps not to.", "And watch Greg disappear like a fart in the wind. Which would probably make OP & their child's life better.", "Sadly, I'd say you're correct on both counts. But OP needs to cover her ass and her sons wellbeing. Do it by the book so its harder to use against her."]}
