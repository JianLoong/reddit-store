The only thing you're in the wrong for here letting him off too easy. WTF kind of adult kicks a football inside any house, let alone that of the sister he's living with? He clearly doesn't respect your mom's wishes or boundaries, and I'd bet my car that this is nowhere near the only instance of that. And trying to blame you for it? Sounds like a serious first-rate asshole and user.

End of story.", "Nope, NTA. Actions have consequences. He\u2019s way past old enough to learn that. Don\u2019t blame his GF for kicking him out with that attitude.", "NTA.

Then he instantly tried to blame you.  Yes, your expression was crude...but apt.  There is one AH here and it ain't you.  NTA", "NTA. Can\u2019t believe a grown ass man is acting like such a child.

There's a reason why he was kicked out by his gf. I won't be surprised if your mom does too in the future", "Nta. He broke the rule. Your mom was nice enough to let him move in.
