OP doesn't have a bond with Ellie, she is practically a stranger. He calls her mother his father's wife, not his stepmother. \n\nApparently Ellie lived with her mother and because of that she lived with OP's father from 15 to 18 years old. But it doesn't seem like his father was acting as a stepfather for Ellie, because she already had a father. OP didn't provide much information about the relationship between Ellie and his father. Did they bonded together? Did he pay for Ellie while she was living there? Did Ellie visited him after her mother's death? Based on the fact OP's father left her nothing, there most probably wasn't much of a relationship between them.\n\nI'm not saying it doesn't suck for Ellie, but just because her late mother married a wealthy man doesn't make her entitled - legally, morally or ethically - to a part of OP's inheritance of his recently deceased father.", "Well from the OPs comments and the post I personally didn't get the feeling that OP is the kind of person to help the other one out.\n\nWhich may be why they lied. But I said I didn't agree with the lying.\n\nBut the dad and step mum were together over a decade (OP said in a comment). So they spent a decent amount of time together and unless the step sister bullied OP then I just feel like it's kind of cruel to have so much and leave the sister so little. \n\nIt's not like the sister is demanding half of anything. OP gets property and all the money. The step sister basically got nothing from the man who was in her life for over 10 years. Which must hurt. \n\nOP clearly has more than enough and then some. And doesn't even particularly love the painting. So I just don't get why they couldn't give their sister something.\n\nAlso OP is a female not a male", "\"She made a bad deal for her daughter\" sounds like an awfully low-empathy statement to me, and gives me a great deal of pause.  Perhaps a different way to frame it is that she made a grave error in character judgment in anticipating your father would provide for her at least modestly.", "\u20ac100k is life changing money for most people. Will help get them out of debt, or put as down payment for a house.", "This is a\"judgment\" sub-reddit. If my opinion, and others, does not matter, OP should not post here.\n\nYes, if OP's father gifted the wife a car, that car should be for the daughter.\n\nConceptually there is no difference between a 100k\u20ac or a 1\u20ac gift. Either is a gift or it isn't.\n\nOP's father having a relationship or not with the stepdaughter has nothing to do with this. If the painting was a gift, it should be given to the recipient of the wife's inherithance, even if OP's father never met the person.", "My father provided for his wife extremely well. I\u2019ve had copies of my father\u2019s will every year since I was 18, the only time it has materially changed is after the death of his wife.

She would have had residence of her marital home and an allowance from the trust for the rest of her life. **Upon her death it would all have passed to me anyway**.\n\nOP's father and his wife chose to NOT share their assets when they got married.

Do not feel bad.", "NTA. \nShe wanted a gift from you under the guise of sentimentality and that turned out to be a lie she was just looking for a quick way to get some cash. \n\nSince it's obviously of no sentimental value to her whatsoever there's no reason to give it to her.

Legally it was your fathers you survived her so it belongs to him. Then to you after his passing. She just wanted it to hock it.

Once again, this thread is about MORALITY not what you have to do legally. \n\nYour father married a woman with a child. That child became his child in marriage. Since you have told us that he established a trust to go to his wife until her death if he died first, Ellie, as the wife\u2019s only child is MORALLY entitled to that money. Your late father was an asshole nor providing for her. Now you, knowing this and being rich, with all the inheritance and estate, refuse to even give her a painting that was sentimental to her mother. Why? Because she was going to sell it? So what? You conveniently shuffled past the value of the painting in your original post to gain sympathy and muddy the waters.  \u20ac100,000 is a life changing amount of money for almost everyone. And yet you would deny this to your neglected step-sister why? Maybe there is a reason she lied. You sound like a selfish, gate-keeping pedantic asshole. My condolences for your loss.", "Gonna go with an unusual judgement but NAH.  It\u2019s your painting, so you ultimately get to decide what to do with it.  And you were lied to, which makes you understandably less willing to cooperate with your stepsister to essentially do her a favor.  \n\nThat said, I can\u2019t really blame the stepsister.  It\u2019s pretty clear from your comments that despite having an amicable relationship with your father, she got less than dirt from him.  And her mother wasn\u2019t in a position where she could have provided much when she passed.  It\u2019s also clear that you would have never considered helping her financially, despite being well off enough to own multiple properties and an extensive painting collection.  \u20ac100,000 is life-changing money.  She probably felt she had no choice but to try and pursue it.  Not to mention, she does have a claim on the painting if indeed the painting was a gift from your father to her mother.

They lived on a house on top of a hill in AN ESTATE. They went on 4 weeks of vacation a year with family. Rented entire mansions on beaches for weeks at a time. But since they went to uni and lived in a sharehouse in their 20s they were all \"I'm lower middle class, maybe middle!\"\n\nAnd I started to show them MY childhood. I would say I was lower middle but stats say I was lower. So probably lower. Poor folk always seem to think they're higher class, just an observation really. I would talk about how I stole food to eat, or how we skipped from home to home 11 times in my youth because of rent hikes. How I still felt blessed and middle class because most weeks we had food. Not all weeks, but most... And that was a lot more than some of my friends had. I had hot water. I was so rich!!!!\n\nI literally a few weeks ago asked my partner \"hey what do middle class people do for fun anyway?\" since I got a middle class job now and have no idea what to do with it. Imagine my shock when my joke question had REAL answers.

People with money really do different things.", "Every time I (who grew up with a poor, single, immigrant mother in subsidized housing) calls a rich person rich, they always correct me and say that they're not rich they're \"comfortable\". Which I guess I can see, to them they're not billionaires but they have financial security so they can comfortably spend money. But to me, having financial security is just as fantastical as being a billionaire so it means the same thing by my standards. I'm uncomfortable if I have to spend over $20 on a single item whereas they would be quite \"comfortable\" with that. But it still always irked me a little that they'd say they're not rich. Like, you have an in-ground pool, a built in hot tub,  a theater room, a finished basement with a living room and rec room with a pool table and an office, 4 bedrooms upstairs  a giant kitchen, a sitting room and a living room, 4 luxury cars, in an area where a small, one level house is already like $2 million dollars and you're telling me you're not rich? I mean, after spending all that money, maybe they're not anymore, but at one point they had that money to be able to spend, even as a loan, so they're still rich.", "Does that mean it wouldn't make an impact? It seems what means almost nothing to you means enough to lie over to her. Sounds like you are wealthy, and she is not.
