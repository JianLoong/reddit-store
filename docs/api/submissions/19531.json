This piece was not that. It means something to me because it belonged to a parent I\u2019ve now lost, but no more than his cars, for example. They\u2019re a piece of him, but not a piece of *us*. That\u2019s why, since Ellie said it meant SO much to her I was willing to give it to her. Turns out it meant nothing to her, so why should she have it?", "No, she wasn\u2019t in the will.", "NTA - nice try Ellie. That would be a nope\n\nEnjoy the painting. Place it on your wall, pour yourself a coffee and remember the good times with your dad.", "It wasn\u2019t really a gift. My father loved art, and when he married his late wife and she moved into the house, he allowed her to choose a piece of art to put in a specific place in the house as a gesture that it was now her home as well. So they picked it out together. He paid for it, it sat in the house he owned, he paid for its insurance etc. He didn\u2019t gift it to her like it had her name on it. I didn\u2019t decide what he did with his possessions, it wasn\u2019t up to me whether I inherited it.", "Aww, shucks.", "You have multiple homes, a valuable painting you don\u2019t plan to sell, and a significant trust, but you will not give anything to your stepsister? \n\nI\u2019m leaning toward YTA for that.", "I am just commenting here to emphasize u/gc-1 \u2018s comment. Especially with this response, I think it is something for you to consider. \n\nThough you are not obliged - so NTA, but I do vote to consider the suggestion above given your position. \n\nSorry for your loss. I am happy you have pieces of your father to remind you of him for the rest of your days. Sending you a hug", "If she was a good wife to your father, giving the daughter an offer to \"buy out her half\" of that painting wouldn't be out of line. Unless there was significant jewelry/valuables gifted to her mother and included in the items returned to her daughter, it sounds like her mother made a poor deal.", ">That's because everything was bought with her dad's money.\n\nRight- and it would have also been the mother's money had the father died first. OP is just holding on to something for admittedly no reason besides they are judging when it could be used to help out her father's WIFE's daughter. Incredibly petty to me. Now it will likely sit in storage unappreciated anyways since OP doesn't even care about the item.", "That\u2019s great that he had the foresight - many people do not!", "It seems very strange to me that he'd leave her nothing absent a very good reason. I suppose if he'd had no parental role at all in her life I could see it. Not the choice I'd make in his position, but that's another topic entirely.", "Okay thanks for explaining! I am more enlightened now thanks to you! \n\nPersonally, I come from a family with absolutely no assets and I don't think that will change by the time my parents start dying, so I did find your comment a little bit flippant about which end of the stick you're holding onto etc etc, but that's a me a problem i suppose! \n\nAll in all you're still not the asshole OP, but you were fine with giving her the painting before you knew she was going to sell, because you hoped it would hold some sentimental value for her (as it doesn't mean that much to you anyway) so I don't see the problem with giving her the painting to do with what she wants? It sounds like finances have never been a worry for you, but  speaking as someone who comes from the lowest social stratification there is, money is important. Even if it isn't to you. But again not your problem! I suppose. \n\nI'm still not sure, this one has me feeling mixed feelings, but again, nobody could call you an asshole for not doing it to begin with, but I think the fact you changed your mind when finding out she would sell is a big thing. Like, what if the case of wine you gifted to your friend was sold because she needed money for food? Anyways idk I could think about this one all day but I'm going to give it a rest now. Thanks for replying, and look after yourself!! :)", "If you wouldn\u2019t mind being a bit more specific (even ballparky), I\u2019m dying to know how much this painting is worth and what the average person would consider a lot of money, because that number in my mind could vary greatly, and I\u2019m just super curious! Pretty please with sugar on top?", "This makes you sound rich af lol", "Why so coy? $20,000? $100,000? I want to know whether I'm an average person in your eyes.", "I agree on not gifting her the painting, but seeing as she seems hard up on money and she got nothing from your father's will (and if I am reading this right, nothingfrom her own mother as it got absorbed into your father'sestate), would gifting her a sum of cash be appropriate?  I know you can gift smaller sums of money tax free if it is something you wouldn't mind doing yearly.\n\nEDIT:Just saw the edit by OP that stepsister did get money from her mother (which I thought wasn't the case, as it sounded like it was absorbed into dad's estate.)\n\nSince she did get money, giving her money is not appropriate.  Leaving the comment above as is because I don't know how to do a strike through text on mobile.", "Did you mean to reply to me? I think you meant the submitter or the commenter that said to give her ex step sister money.", "[Bot](https://old.reddit.com/user/Separaxdcuspec) stole [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146tk0q/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_stepsister_a_piece/jns0kfy/)", "Even if it was gifted to his wife, when she died, her possessions became his. Only what was in her will should be honored. Or if your father had left it to her daughter in his will.\n\nNTA", "I dunno, I mean, you said you're not attached to it. The way you speak I imagine 100k euro isn't going to break you and it would help her. Maybe just give it to her but make her sign that she won't ask for other stuff.", "I hear you rationalizing the refusal to acknowledge that the step-sister might actually have some claim to the picture.\n\n\u20ac1,000 or even \u20ac10,000, would you feel differently about it?\n\nEven your use of the word \"average\" seems dismissive and, frankly, a bit condescending. I have plenty of money, some would consider me wealthy, and I'd consider \u20ac100,000 a boatload. If you are so above average that you deem it \"not much money,\" why not let your stepsister have the picture that her mother picked out (which your father \"allowed\" her to do, eyeroll) even if her intention is to sell it? it would than be an additional inheritance for your stepsister.\n\nIs this all because she wasn't upfront about her intention to sell it? Have a clear and frank discussion with her about it, then offer her the painting. Where exactly would this cause you pain? apparently not in your wallet. Maybe in your snobby attitude?\n\nETA: I fully expect to get downvoted for this, esp. my last line. Every time I try to edit spelling or such the panel freaks out and deletes words, and I'm sure there is a better word than \"snobby.\" Maybe supercilious.", "Well, see, the biggest issue is lying to her. Just flat out say \"Hey that painting Mom liked? Could I have it? I'm struggling and selling it could help me a lot. \" Not lie to her stepsister to swindle her.", "You have no idea what, if any, relationship OP or dad had with the step sister. She could be an acquaintance", "From what I know of Ellie\u2019s financial situation - which admittedly isn\u2019t much - an offer to purchase the painting maybe well be seen as facetious, or insulting, given its value. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say her mother made a bad deal for herself. She was well provided for. Had my father die first she would have remained so for the rest of her life. She made a bad deal for her daughter.", ">would have also been the mother's money had the father died first\n\nNo. Op already said that if dad would've died first, all wife would've got was an allowance and the right to live in the house until she died.  So wife's daughter still wouldn't have gotten anything. \n\n>OP is just holding on to something for admittedly no reason besides they are judging when it could be used to help out her father's WIFE's daughter. Incredibly petty to me.\n\n And the reason that it's hers. And that her father, the owner, wanted her to have it. \n\n>Now it will likely sit in storage unappreciated anyways since OP doesn't even care about the item.\n\nIf you actually read op's comments, she said that the painting is on a wall in her dad's favorite house. But, just to be clear, even if it held no importance whatsoever to op, it's still hers. \n\n>help out her father's WIFE's daughter. Incredibly petty to me.\n\n Who is basically a stranger to OP.", "It\u2019s not strange if you knew him.", "The last valuation was above \u20ac100k.

They just probably are going, well, I can't quit my job to hang out with strippers all day while keeping their art collection and multiple homes so they don't consider themselves rich af while still understanding what an average person considers worth a lot.", "Lol I wish", "The last valuation put it above \u20ac100k. So\u2026are you average lol", "She got her mothers life insurance policy payout & all of her mothers belongings.", "I'm not convinced she's hard on money, OP says the painting is \"worth a lot to the average person\".

Rewarding poor behavior?", "wtf someone tried to scam OP and you're suggesting giving them money for what? \n\nand to give her money yearly?\n\nJesus OP \\*I\\* need money, I also got nothing from your father's will AND I didn't scam you. \n\nGive me money yearly. kthxbai", "Use ~ twice on each end.", "I\u2019m not refusing to acknowledge it, I don\u2019t believe that to be the case. If it is the case, legally, I\u2019ll see her in court, I guess. I don\u2019t know what else to say on that.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean it to be condescending, and I apologise if any one took it that way.

To any extent OP decides to provision for Ellie, it would have less to do with his own relationship to her, and more to do with doing the right thing on behalf of his late father. His father obviously was making considered decisions and could have provided for Ellie if he wanted, and he chose not to. But sometimes people have blind spots. I\u2019ve often had to double back after my father short-changed a waiter. This is a trivial example, but I am making the point that different generations of people sometimes see things differently in terms of behavioral expectations.  Perhaps in a prior generation, if OP was an heir but not the first born son, he would have been disinherited too.", "Well the stepsister lived with OP\u2019s father for a few years, that much is true.", "I guess we just aren\u2019t going to feel the same way about this but that\u2019s alright.
