Being young and not wanting to inconvenience the restaurant staff, we always did one check. The rest of us paid for our meals, drinks, and tips. She would purposely underpay, thereby reducing the overall tip for the wait staff. It got to the point we just said separate checks as soon as we sat down.

That's cool. Good people. \n\nYour friend was trying to take advantage of you for the second time. If this was a one time occurrence, I can understand why she was upset (although that does not in any way oblige you to pay for her if you don't want to).\n\nOnly thing, I think it would have been better if you told her WHY you were uncomfortable.

We can see how over time your enabling behaviour reinforces tryout friends bad behaviour. And this is the natural reaction. Good job standing up for yourself, but these are natural consequences.", "NTA. Happy to say that I got rid of a friend who did that same sort of thing. \n\nI was taking her to a doctor\u2019s appointment one day and she said \u201cI have lunch money. Can we go somewhere other than fast food?\u201d I agreed and the saga began.\n\nAt lunch, she ordered a mixed drink and the appetizer sampler. I matched her drink order and a small entree. Still less expensive than her appetizer sampler.

It doesn\u2019t matter what she says, she\u2019s caught and she wants to muddy the waters by insulting you. Tell her that the game is up, and that you KNOW that she\u2019s a user. As Taylor Swift sings, you \u201care never, ever ever getting back together\u201d as friends. Learn the lesson, you can even mock her for being a moocher, and make better friends.", "I don\u2019t remember when this was posted on AITA but OP was fed up of her SIL \u201cforgetting\u201d her wallet so frequently that she actually went back into the house, retrieved the \u201cforgotten\u201d wallet, and presented it to SIL when the check came. Love that energy.", "NTA - you\u2019re not wrong for creating and maintaining a boundary like this! \n\nI do wonder if your friend would have been amenable to the idea of \u201cpre-paying\u201d for herself by Venmoing you say $40 and then you both are aware of the spending limit, but I mostly suspect that this person is uninterested in funding her own lifestyle. \n\nIt sounds like you made the right call! Keep protecting you!", "NTA. I think most of us have had *that* friend. I do think you should have been straight up and honest about your reasoning from the start instead of making up \"other excuses\". It was obviously a truth she needed to hear.", "I think everyone on this planet would benefit from having to work at least one retail or food service job in their lives.", "NTA and we see WAY too many posts on AITA where people ask if they are an asshole for refusing to pay for friends who ALWAYS conveniently forget to bring their wallet.  Please people, realize that you're NEVER an asshole for not letting someone take advantage of you. Friend here not only had the audacity to NOT go and get her wallet but then pitched a fit and went home when you asked her to.  She's an asshole, you're only mistake was to not tell her sooner that you wouldn't be subsidizing her anymore. Hopefully she got the message now.  NTA and she's clearly not a good friend.", "My mom, plus the GI bill, put my dad through college after WWII, with mom waitressing to pay most of their household expenses.  I grew up hearing her stories.  (By the time I showed up, Dad had become an accountant and she was his assistant, a job that was much gentler on the psyche.)  I've never worked retail or as a server, but I can't pay a restaurant bill without remembering my mother, and I tip generously.  I'm annoyed that waitstaff in the US live or die financially by tips, but there doesn't seem any political will to fix the problem.\n\nOh, and OP, NTA. Someone forgetting their wallet once, I could see. More than twice, and that's weaselese for \"I don't want to pay for myself, and I don't see why I should when I can stiff my supposed friends\".   With apologies to actual mustelids.", "NTA. As someone who gets walked on all the time, OP, I just want you to know that it can be uncomfortable establishing boundaries, but it's necessary if you want to be a happy person. And one of the great things about it is that you can see people for who they are. If they freak out when you create a boundary, they're probably not someone you WANT in your life.\n\nYou took the trash out, now enjoy your life without constantly paying her way.", "Is it really a boundary if OP was never straight with her though? Her friend asked her for reasons and OP could have been upfront about it instead of making excuses. I do agree OP is NTA but she could have been more transparent \"you still haven't paid me for the ticket & uber from last time and I don't feel comfortable lending you more money until I'm paid back in full\". It doesn't seem like OP is good at asking either. If you're owed money, you can ask them. Based on her wording it seems she just waits for her friend to offer and then just not do anything if the friend doesn't pay her back. In an ideal world everyone pays you back and you don't need to ask them to do that but sometimes a bit more communication and reminding is needed and it doesn't necessarily make the borrower an asshole unless they actually refuse to pay you back despite being reminded", "\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc", "Or had her card on her phone to pay herself! My first thought was she had her phone so she can pay.", "She\u2019s literally done the thing of ordering the most expensive thing and then asking to split the bill before. So on point \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 What a cheapskate", "Goes to show why she posts a selfie and gets 2 likes. Jesus.", "She even told me that I\u2019m the one who never pays for anything when I\u2019ve literally paid for her our entire friendship. She\u2019s delusional and insane", "She doesn\u2019t have any friends, so I\u2019m trying to take that in a way that doesn\u2019t make me feel less valuable.", "Basically you\u2019re saying set expectations and boundaries earlier?", "Wow how close was this friend??", "I think just because of how terribly she treated me.", "Oh she\u2019s absolutely a mooch", "Wow, why are these people so entitled? \nLike they genuinely believe others should pay for all their shit. Wtf", "Smart!! Like this. Thank you.", "I probably should have come straight out with that. I did eventually get there and she accused me of being the one leeching off her when I have never in my life done that. It\u2019s so crazy.", "I appreciate that. I probably would have but I am not fully comfortable around this friend and find her harsh and judgmental. The last time I set a boundary with her she almost ended the friendship. I don\u2019t think I felt safe saying this to her.", "My first job was McDonald\u2019s and my second was waitressing - totally agree", "My first job was packing groceries at a supermarket. I got fired for my bad attitude!\n\nI found my bar waitressing experience gave me invaluable skills as a teacher later on.", "Or some form of customer service job- coming from a former janitor. I don't think you'd be surprised at the suffering I went through.", "Honestly any form of customer service. There will still be some that think they're special but it would hopefully stop so much entitlement.", "I work front desk at a screen print company so I have to answer the phones, deal with walkins, manage my customers via email etc. I really like working this version of customer service because make our own pricing since everything is custom, if someone pisses me off I get to up-charge them, and it feels fucking great.", "Yeah, it was the remembering the ID that confirms this was intentional. And a precedent was set because you had done it so many times before, so now she\u2019s expecting it. Good for you to make a boundary about it! She\u2019s just mad because she can\u2019t mooch off of you anymore. And the fact that she chose to go home instead of getting her wallet and coming back tells me she doesn\u2019t value your company as much as your money.\n\nNTA", "I know many of these type of people. They all do exactly the same thing and all think that nobody realizes \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Next time you go out with her (lol, probs not happening) and you know she has her wallet on her tell the waitstaff that she'll take the bill. Or an actual bit of advice, 1.) never go to a restaurant without telling the waitstaff it's going to be on seperate bills 2.) collect receipts and have proof of how much she owes you.  3.) just be straight up with her and tell her that you are not going to pay for a single thing for her from now own.  If she doesn't have her wallet (Apple wallet/ Google play is a thing and I doubt she'd forget her phone anywhere) she can go tf home.  \nTalk to mutual friends (I would be interested in hearing what they have to say) about her behavior and see if you can get the others to agree to a firm boundary with her.  She has to stop mooching or she's excluded.", "Cut out this user from your life.", "I\u2019m saying you set expectations inadvertently. You did not intend your friend to rely on you for her entertainment expense but it seems like that is what happened. Unfortunately subsidizing people often ends up like this when the subsidy stops. And to that I like to remind people that an expectation creates an interest. One of the more interesting catch phrases I learned in property law. More of an explanation of your friends behaviour. So you set expectations earlier by paying I\u2019m guessing repeatedly, and then the boundary came later when you told her to retrieve her wallet.", "> not fully comfortable around this friend\n\n> find her harsh and judgmental\n\nWait, this person makes you feel uncomfortable but you continue to interact with her? \n\nImagine if a friend of yours had been informed by his doctor that he had a strawberry allergy, but said friend continued to eat strawberries and then complained on a daily basis about itchy hives that made him uncomfortable.\n\nWhat would be your advice to this friend? Perhaps avoiding strawberries altogether? Do you understand my analogy?", "For future reference, if a friend/partner gets angry about a boundary being set, they are likely a user or abuser and you should reevaluate the relationship.\n\nThough with the caveat that it was actually a boundary and not just an attempt to control someone but calling it a boundary, since I've noticed that some manipulators have realized that they can use that word to get what they want from people who don't understand the concept of boundaries that well and prefer to avoid conflict.", "Exactly!!
