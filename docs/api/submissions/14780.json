And even before having kids, he sees you as his unpaid maid. \n\nThis guy sounds possessive. He wants to use the house to control you and preventing you from moving out, as he'd be keeping all the family assets as his personals. This is not a healthy situation, and not a safe one. \n\nImagine you have kids, but you have to stop working at some point during the pregnancy because of health issues.
