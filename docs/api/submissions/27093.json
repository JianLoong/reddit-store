For a little backstory, I work midnights, and my boyfriend works EARLY mornings. On my days off, he will try to stay up super late with me for some \"quality time\". We have our own places, but spend 90% of the time at mine. Most days, he will come over right after work (2-3 pm), wake me up (even though I just fell asleep at noon), and state it was because he wanted to have some \"quality time\" before I go back to work. **Remember that last sentence, because it is important information for later.\n\nThe main problem is when he tries to stay up late with me, he loses on hours of sleep, and when he does not get his full 8 hours, he starts crying like a absolute baby in the morning. I mean full on bawling to the point if I fell asleep early (3am for me), he will wake me up with how loud he is crying and whining about being \"exhausted and tired\". At first, I was very empathetic about him being tired, but 2 years later, I'm just annoyed at this point.\n\nI have tried giving him so much advice, all mainly pertaining to going to bed at an earlier set time. I have even laid in bed with him until he fell asleep, but he wakes so easily and asks me to,  \"Come back to bed\" when I'm trying to leave.\n\nLike I said, I work midnights. It's really hard for me to go to bed at 8-9 PM. He tells me I can just do it on my days off for him, but it messes up my sleep schedule.\n\nSo this past Friday, I finally lost it on him. He was up late the night before again, wanting to watch a movie with me. I told him he should go to bed instead, because it was already 9PM. He said he would be fine, because he took a nap that day. Next morning, he full on bawling and crying in the bathroom again and it woke me in my bedroom. I was fuming at this point. \nWhen he came out, I told him, \"Sounds like that nap didn't work\". Through his tears, he said, \" You just need to quit your job and start working days so I don't have to lose on sleep.\"\n\nI lost it. I started yelling that he can't blame me for his lack of sleep. I told him to go to bed. During my screaming, I reminded him how he doesn't even allow me to get 2 hours of sleep because of his \"quality time\" and I never cry nor complain about it. He told me it's not fair/ not the same because I can function on little amounts of sleep. \nI ended the argument by telling him to suck it up and learn to be an adult. \n\nHe texted me later on in the day that he was extremely hurt by my words, and how he ended up having the worst day of his life at work because I didn't comfort him and instead yelled at him while he was crying. I texted back, \"When the boy crys wolf enough times, you learn to tune it out.\" \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for yelling at my crybaby of a boyfriend? \n\n\n*Mind you,  this 28 year old man wants to have children here soon.

I know couples who have made it work, but they sacrifice a lot. If you want your relationship to go the mile, you\u2019ll both need to put in a lot of work or get on the same schedule.

I understand that everyone\u2019s sleep needs are different, and everyone wakes up differently (I like to have an hour or two to putter around before eating, showering, etc for example) but his histrionics are the sign of something else in my non-professional opinion.

I\u2019d be annoyed af too. You\u2019re sacrificing your sleep just so that he can feel \u201ccomforted.\u201d That\u2019s some bullshit right there. Does he think your his mommy?
