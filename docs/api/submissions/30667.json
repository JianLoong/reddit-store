I don\u2019t know why she decided she was just going to take my snake, but I told her she couldn\u2019t have my expensive new pet.  I have planned and saved up for this snake for a while. It doesn\u2019t make any sense that I would do that and then offer her the snake I just got 2 weeks ago, does it?  I wish I knew why she was claiming that I was going to give it to her.\u201d", "NTA\n\nThis sister has a kid?  She's not 12 herself?", "INFO:   What was the discussion (Phone, text?) before your sister and her BF came over to Talk and check out the snake?  \n\n  \nI will vote NTA - but would love to know why your sister AND her BF thought you were giving her the snake as even the BF was stating that what you said was messed up.  I mean he could have just been trying to support her and siding with her but I was just wondering.  If what the post states is true, your sister does seem spoiled and / or manipulative and I think it might be best to stay LC with her for a bit.", "NTA. Your sister sounds spoiled.", "Hahahahaha WOW. The AuDaCiTY of your sister to somehow assume that she could just *have* the snake you had just bought for yourself... and then throw a tantrum when you assert that no, you actually want to keep **your** snake. NTA is any way; your sister is deluded.", "I feel like there's more to this story than you're saying.  She wouldn't just ASSUME you were giving her the snake... what was the lead up to meeting this snake?", "Your sister sounds like a classic narcissist NTA. Also why would you want your snake around a baby...", "NTA.\n\nWhat is the deal with entire families being mad at the rational one?", "NTA! \n\nShe has no right to claim your snake because she wants him. She sounds a little delusional", "NTA.  Does she normally act this entitled?  Does your family normally believe her over you?\n\nChange the locks or do whatever you have to do.  I wouldn't put it past her to steal your danger noodle.", "NTA - sister saw a new shiny and she decided she wanted it. Does she have a track record of taking your stuff because that is what siblings do? \n\nYou are offering the snake a good home and he is definitely not a good gift for a baby. \n\nAsk you mother why you'd pay a lot of money for a snake you've always wanted and then decide to give snake and set-up to your sister so soon? Is it her b'd day? Is it Xmas yet? Why is your mother and relatives believing a story with so many holes in it?

You aren't the one who is messed up.", "NTA, but this story sounds to ridiculous to be true .", "NTA. Is your sister always like this? Thinks she can just take whatever she wants? Yikes.", "NTA.\n\nAlso getting a snake for a less than 1 yo child? Yeah...right, that definitely sounds like a great idea.\n\nIf I were you I would block her, her bf and all her minions. If family is so dead set in her having a snake maybe pass them the contact of your seller for them to get the little baby a snake. I bet if they pool their money togheter they can get a similar one + all the needed things for her to keep it.", "Your sister is mental. Like. Actual.", "Op wheres the pet tax??

I would definitely tell everyone that she's full of garbage. She came over to see your snake was holding it and then said oh I'm doing this this and this for the snake when I take it with me. I never told her she could have my snake that I saved up for. She's not taking it or the cage or anything. If she does I will call the police do you have a receipt I presume and proof that you paid and bought the snake, right? Make sure she can't get into wherever you live. If you live at home with your mom your mom's probably going to give it to her. Yeah I can see the snake giving out in harming her baby and then she's going to blame you for that. Make sure no one else have keys to your place and if so change the locks. You might want to get cameras too.", "If you live in Florida, Y T A as they have become an introduced species that is causing havoc with the ecosystem.\n\nIf you live elsewhere, in no life is it OK to steal someone else's pet that they have recently bought.

That is your pet you bought.\n\n\nSend a group text to your family and ask, \u201c So when you guys all asked to hold (insert nephew) for the first time did that actually mean you wanted to house and raise the nephew? I am just wondering if I missed something because I thought the same rules applied to pets.  Sister asked if she could hold pet and I said yes you can hold pet.
