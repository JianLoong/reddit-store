This was the first wedding in our group and our first experience with being bridesmaids. There were no expectations set by the bride as to what our roles would be when she asked us to be bridesmaids.\n\nThe issue: During wedding planning, things were coming to us out of left field without prior communication. For example, we had to pay half the amount of our dresses, pay >1k for a bachelorette trip (even though we had no say in the trip itinerary and location). We did it of course to support bride.\n\nBride didn't ask the MOH directly, but expected her to plan the bridal shower. I asked how MOH was going to pay for the shower because bride had expectations for an \"instagram-worthy\" event e.g. balloon arches, alcohol, food, elaborate decorations. The bride's response was \"I don't know...ask her\".\n\nWeeks later, the MOH tells us all the bridesmaids are paying for the bridal shower (didn't ask). We thought it was weird the bride never asked us directly to pay for this, but rallied and gave the bride exactly what she wanted and paid for the event.\n\nMonths later, before the bachelorette, the bride tells us (didn't ask) that we also should pay for the trip's alcohol, snacks, decorations for the bachelorette party (for 15 girls, most of whom were not bridesmaids). At this point, the bridesmaids asked if it was okay if each person attending the bachelorette party could bring their own alcohol/snacks.\n\nThe bride became upset we were \u201cruining\u201d her wedding experience by having opinions and questions on everything she asked for, first the bridal shower, then the bach party. Bride said she googled that bridesmaids were supposed to pay for the bridal shower and that we were \"not street smart\" for not knowing this. Bride \"asked all of her other friends who said obviously the bridesmaids should pay for everything\".\n\nBridesmaids felt guilty because the bride said we made her wedding experience very stressful and after the wedding she would be needing space from us as friends. We turned into \"yes\" people to give her everything she wanted for the wedding. We took initiative and paid for one of her wedding desserts/decorations.\n\nPost-wedding, bride took space from us and didn't invite us to a party she hosted. It's been over a year later and she still holds resentment over the wedding issue and has gotten upset at us for lesser issues. We\u2019ve offered to talk about it but she hates confrontation and is avoiding the topic.\n\nAs bridesmaids, we had faults by making bride\u2019s wedding experience stressful. At the same time, we tried very hard to make up for it. It seems like the bride is holding onto the things we didn\u2019t know and does not seem to acknowledge all the efforts we\u2019ve made since.\n\nAITA for ruining the bride's wedding experience?", "created_utc": 1700066729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vxr0i/aita_for_ruining_the_brides_wedding_experience/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The Bride and/or groom's  family pays for that, not the bridesmaids.", "NTA.\n\nThe bride took full advantage of you all. I don't understand why none of you stood up for yourselfs? I would've removed myself from the wedding.", "NTA.  You weren't bridesmaids, you were the Bank of (insert bride's name here).  Looks like the bride did all of the planning and reservations using the bridesmaid's wallets.  Expectations should have been set forth first so anyone can agree or not agree to become a bridesmaid.", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" is a greedy AH who wants only the best and others pay for it.\n\nShe used you as ATM and now that the wedding is over she has no use for you any more.\n\nYou were being used.", "NTA. Bride sounds like an entitled monster.", "You spend thousands on her wedding experience, only to be dumped after the wedding and she\u2019s got you thinking you might be an AH?  Wow that\u2019s some next level shit.  You\u2019re NTA and don\u2019t let her back in your life", "NTA. People who have these types of expectations for their weddings  are nuts. unfortunately for you and your  friend group this was your first wedding and didn't know that everything that was requested of you was  over the line. \n\nThe fact that the bride has  held a grudge against you all this time is very telling. Just because you were  friends  in school doesn't mean you need to remain friends in your adult life.", "NTA.The bride was entitled and you all learned the danger of accepting the \"honor\" of being a bridesmaid without a very clear picture of what the bride expects and what it will cost. This was a very expensive lesson. You also learned something important about your so-called friend.", "NTA. Like everyone else has said, she took advantage of you all. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous making people contribute financially to that level. I\u2019m a big believer in you-decided-to-have-the-wedding-so-you-pay-for-it. The only exception being that maybe people chip in on the bachelorette party, but not if it\u2019s going to be something ridiculously lavish. I\u2019m talking more like a night out, dinner, drinks, and activity maybe. But her expectations of you all are insane. She ruined her own experience. With an attitude like hers, she will struggle in life and, who knows, maybe in her marriage. You deserve a better friend.", "NTA give that woman all the space she wants, and more.", "NTA.\n\nThe only way I would (or even could) give someone 2K in money is if they were in a life-threatening situation.", "You didn't ruin it, the bride did.\n\nPaying for bridesmaids dresses is normal. Bachelorette should be split; all guests should pay for alcohol and snacks.\n\nBridal showers are hosted by someone who offers, not those who the bride demands hosts. Neither the bride nor MOH has the right to demand the bridesmaids host and the bride has no right to demand an Instagram worthy event.\n\nWedding party doesn't pay for anything related to wedding itself other than their attire.\n\nI would move on because this diva is clearly not your friend", "NTA. But she certainly ruined your experience. Take this as a lesson.  Next time, start saying 'no' a LOT sooner.  You don't have to spend hundreds and hundreds for a bridesmaid dress, pay thousands for a bachelorette weekend (or week), hundreds for makeup and hair. If it's out of your budget, stop immediately.  \"I'm sorry, this is more than I can afford. I have to bow out.\" Or say ahead of time. \"This is all I can afford. If it goes over, I can't participate.\"\n\nNever ever spend more than you feel comfortable for someone else's event.", "NTA. Entitled brides who shake down their friends for money are the real assholes.", "NTA. If a bride or groom have a dream or expected experience then they should budget to pay for it. If someone offers to pay or contribute to that then it is a bonus but it should never be expected in order to conform to their vision.\n\nIf she expected the events but would be happy for you to arrange the events and set the budget depending what was reasonably affordable I would have more sympathy but getting married is not an excuse for multiple expensive parties that everyone else but the bride pays for.", "NTA as you didn\u2019t ruin it. She did. My advice to future, bridesmaids and maid of honors, start your own group chat without the bride.", "NTA. Never speak to this person again. She's awful.", "It sounds like you and the bridesmaids were put through the wringer. Not her. Weddings have gotten to be ridiculous sometimes. Social media imho has made it worse. You\u2019re NTA and I\u2019d take space from the bride. Reflect on your relationship to figure out if it\u2019s always been her way or no way and act accordingly.", "NTA for how this shitty bride felt. This person sounds like an exhausting knob. I\u2019ll never wrap my head around how you all collectively allowed her to walk all over you while you kept handing over wads of your own money. \n\nThe initial problem could\u2019ve been a misunderstanding. Ok. You all sucked it up and acquiesced. Nice friends. No prob. \n\nThen, she began to steamroll and insult you all and not one of you put a stop to it and called a meeting so you all could confront her and bring her back to earth with an ultimatum. How can all of you be so weak?", "The bride is an entitled asshole. She showed you all who she is and how disposable you are. Believe her. I wouldn't let her back into my life after her over-the-top selfishness. Her treatment of her wedding party is disgusting. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She expected too much and out of your pockets. She sounds super spoiled and entitled. Don\u2019t let her come crying to you when her husband bails", "She used you, then she gaslighted you, then she dropped you.\n\nShe let you pay for other girls (probably her real friends). When you had doubts, she started gaslighting (you should have known, its your own fault, if you were good friends, you would care about me and my needs). Then she told you she would need space after the wedding (aka when you stopped being useful)\nI wouldnt be surprised if that was her plan all along. Howlong have you known eachother? And the other girls?\n\nShe was never your friend, you learned a valuable lesson about clearly communicating expectations before committing to something, close that chapter and move on. \n\nNTA", "The bride is doing you and the other bridesmaids a huge favor by keeping her distance.  Goodbye and good riddance to bad rubbish.", "She used you. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA I would have left her stupid wedding party and invited everyone to come with me. She's being ridiculous and now she got everything she wanted she needs space? She needs to get over herself. If her other friends think it's so important the bridesmaids pay for everything how come they weren't bridesmaids then?", "NTA, and can someone please explain to me why some women go so crazy for weddings? I get it to a degree but some people are just bonkers with weddings.", "*We* *~~turned into \"yes\" people~~* *caved into the bride's manipulation to* *~~give her everything she wanted for the wedding~~* *pay for all of the stuff she didn't have budget to pay for*\n\nCorrected it for you.\n\n*~~she would be needing space from us as friends~~* *I decided that I don't need 'friends' like that in my life*\n\nCorrected this for you too.", "NTA - the only way you messed up was when she sid she would need space from you after the weding you didnt say no that space can start right now. Toodaloo. \n\nIf she asked all her friends and they said bridesmaids were the ones to pay and then insulted you why did she not have those friends be the bridesmaids?\n\nPeople have got to stop expecting others to pay for their own entitled wants. And other people have got to learn to say no,  you are being a crazy person so just no I am not doing it.", "NTA.  You ladies got used.  Severely so.", "I am baffled at how much patience people have, I would have just left at the second misunderstandment about the money", "OMG I hate wedding culture.  This is why my partner and I got married in a (fancy) beer garden and arrived by tram together.  TBF, I asked some people for favours (friend with a camera took photos for half an hour, other friends arrived at the venue before us to liaise with the celebrant, but otherwise we threw a party for our friends and family to have a good time with us.

HOWEVER, that means the bride-to-be just gets to show up to the events, she doesn\u2019t get to request/demand/decide/choose anything, and the bridesmaids do whatever they can/want; so if the bridesmaids choose to throw a shower at someone\u2019s apartment with basic PartyCity balloons that\u2019s what happens and the bride better be happy.\n\nNow if she wants everything aesthetic, insta-worthy, and choose everything, guess who is footing that?

And sort of wandered there little bit on the wedding, what with getting the bridesmaids to pay for a dessert and some decorations.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but it sounds less like the bride was treating OP and the other bridesmaids as friends, and more like she was treating them as a cross between employees & ATMs.", "This isn't a kegger, yes there is an expectation that a baby shower/bridal shower will look quite nice and that a lot of photos will be posted on SM. \n\nIf you host a party you don't ask guests to bring food and drinks. It would be a little different if they went to a bar/club, in which case yes, its typical/good manners for the non bridesmaids to buy a round. But this seemed like a house party so why is it a crazy expectation that hosts (MOH/bridesmaids) would supply the snacks and alcohol?\n\nThe only thing that seems unreasonable was the 1k trip.
