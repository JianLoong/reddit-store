It's good that you're talking about your financial obligations, resources, goals and priorities. If tuition was a one time thing, I see your objection to It's being counted as a constant expense of hers.\nIt sounds as if you are both still a bit dependent on your parents' financial help. To whit, maybe one or both of you isn't financially stable and independent enough to move out of the parents' house.\n\nBesides how MUCH you'd each contribute to household expenses and household chores, there's a question of what is included and not included in those categories. Education and training in career skills is important. You're at an age where defining and stabilizing a career path is appropriate. If education is a priority for one or both of you, your mutual plans have to include the reality of the resources (time, energy, money) that must be invested.\n\nIt's okay for some of your financial obligations to remain separate, and only for the one who created them. They do exist. A shared budget based on ignoring some expenses is unrealistic. Your mutual budget should reflect the realities of the expenses of a home, and the resources you each have. Big \"outside expenses\" will limit what money is left for the household. Perhaps to an unsustainable level.\n\nIf the answer to \"can you afford to pay 1/2 of household bills on time consistently?\" is \"no,\" moving in together may be unaffordable right now. That's okay. For you to pick up more than 50% of the household expenses at the cost of your own financial stability and priorities is NOT required.\n\nBeware of manipulations to control YOUR financial decisions by tying them to emotional issues. \"If you loved me you'd (do this thing you're uncomfortable and unwilling to do)\" is manipulative and erodes your boundaries for your own safety.

I understand stand her reasoning but I feel like it's a bit much.  I don't believe a dollar would be that much of a difference?\n\nFirst of all, it's not a dollar; it's a dollar an *hour.*\n\nIf you work full time, 30 hours per week, at (for example) $21/hour, that's roughly $2835/month. If she works part time, 20 hours per week, at (for example) $20/hour, that's roughly $1800/month. So really, a 60/40 split is slightly in your favor, since the actual income differential is more like 61/39.\n\n* ($21 x 30) = $630/week x 4.5 weeks/month=$2835\n* ($20 x 20) = $400/week x 4.5 weeks/month=$1800\n* Combined income $2835 + $1800 = $4635\n* Your percentage $2835 \u00f7 $4635 = .612\n* Her percentage $1800\u00f7 $4635 = .388\n\nOf course, YMMV, since that extra dollar is a lot more significant at $20-21/hour than $200-201/hour, and you don't mention your actual pay. So you can do the math and figure out your actual income differential. Or just use last year's tax returns. \n\nIf your point is she's *not* going to school, and *should* be working full time, then *that's* what you should argue, not that she makes almost as much money as you.\n\nOr if you're living together more as *roommates* than as a *couple*, rent is typically split half and half, or according to square footage and amenities used\u2014the master versus the smaller bedroom, exclusive use of a den as an office, the assigned parking spot, etc.\u2014not on the income of the roommates. If the apartment is too expensive to pay 50/50 you find a cheaper one. But it sounds like you're still in the planning stage.\n\nI'm going to judge NAH. It sounds like your girlfriend is more in the \"we're moving in together as a couple\" mindset, while you're more in the \"roommate with benefits\" headspace.", "So she is using logic by obfuscation. Is it the hourly rate that makes the difference? The actual take home pay?  or excusable expenses?  Her fairness algorithm seems mighty variable on a highly subjective basis. The ultimate design is to ensure you pay more.\n\nNTA- without some figures I can't sort out what's fair in terms of income. However, I do not agree that her tuition is a factor. You are not married. Asking you to invest in her education and future income is not reasonable without some real expectation that you will actually get a return in the form of a future contribution to joint income.", "YTA - why are you focusing on hourly pay? Whats the annual take-home amount for you two individually? Why consider moving in with someone who works part-time and studies, and think that you working full time is comparable?  Why is it ok for you to be filling your savings with a larger paycheck, and making it so she cannot save anything? It should be split as a ratio of annual earnings e.g. you earn $50 and she earns $10 you should be paying $5 versus her $1\n\nSeriously think about if you're ready to be moving in together, if you aren't happy to split like that with her you may not be ready for this next step. Moving in together means responsibilities and stepping up to help the other person when they need it.", "NTA, but that doesn't mean you're right.\n\nAs someone who negotiates contract terms as part of my job, there are a LOT of ways to remedy this, but you're probably both putting yourself in a bad situation.  You both need to discuss a number of questions like:  What happens if you break up?  Who pays for the utilities and services?  What happens when costs go up (they will)?  If you're just starting out, who is buying the furniture and household goods for the apartment?  Realistically, I generally support the comments that suggest that you're not ready to take this step, but if you decide to go for it anyway, you should absolutely not do it the way you're discussing.\n\nONE of you should rent the apartment with just ONE name on the lease and that person takes 100% responsibility for the apartment and associated bills (utilities, renters insurance, parking, internet/steaming services, etc.).  Then, regardless of the amount that person is paying directly, you negotiate how much the other person will contribute each month (with the clearly expressed expectation that this will be renegotiated in the future, and what triggers that renegotiation).  If it's a viable scenario (like multiple bedrooms) it should probably be roughly what you could get from a roommate if you break up and the other moves out.  If neither of you are comfortable being solely responsible for the apartment, then don't do it and it's a bad financial discussion regardless.\n\nThe person who's name is on the lease assumes a LOT more risk and it's reasonable for the other to pay a premium for not assuming that risk.

Maybe for the first months it'll be you paying the 60, then the next she will, etc. I feel like there are other compromises that could be made and, if she refuses to compromise at all and makes you feel bad for wanting a compromise, then I may reconsider living with her for the time being.", "Yes.
