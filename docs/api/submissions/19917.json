She has said she diets out of her choice no dietary reasons or religious reasons.\n\nMy family was planning a whole family dinner as we have not had one for a while ever since the start of COVID, the sickness of both my grandparents and my grandfathers death last year October. \n\nI have just recently moved in our own home with my wife in May and because of it our family decided I should host the dinner. We willingly accepted and were both super excited for it. This dinner would be a first big family dinner without our grandfather who was a big pillar in our family so it was extra special, my wife is also pregnant and we were hoping to tell them at the dinner for. \n\nOn the day of the dinner we decided to do a big barbecue. We handled the barbecue meats and some side while our family would bring desserts, sides or come help us cook. We have a large group chat with all my family where we spoke about what each of us was making/ bringing before the day of the dinner. My aunt had kept it a secret as many of my other family members did which was fine as we all quite love a secret cake.\n\nEveryone had all arrived minus my aunt (she was normally late but we did not want to eat cold food). We set out the table and let the kids start eating slowly and waited on my aunt. Eventually she did come half an hour after the time to be here. Most of the family had just started to eat.\n\nWhen she arrived immediately there was tension. She complained that I had made barbecue as she was now vegan mind you the barbecue was not a secret I made it clear what we were having. Then she began to complain about the food other people had brought as they too were not vegan friendly minus some salad. Then she began to berate me for my selfishness to not accommodate for her and said this was a hate crime to her and her lifestyle.\n\nIt annoyed a lot of us who had waited for her and especially my poor grandmother who just wanted our family to be civil. She normally causes quite a lot of trouble at these things but with how significant this dinner was I had hoped she would not make a big deal out of this. \n\nI really could not believe she pulled out the minority card for being vegan so I just ended it and ushered her to the door so we could at least talk. Her ex husband went after to me and was there to help me. I told her plainly that she never warned us and she knew what the plans were and had no right to be upset. Then I said it would be best she left. She was shocked as this was one of the first time any one of our family fought back so aggressively. She left but not without shouting at how ungrateful and selfish we all were.\n\nAm I the asshole for kicking her out? I could tell my grandma was upset and my mom pulled me aside after dinner and told me I was out of line for disrespecting an elder.", "created_utc": 1687029697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bzc0v/aita_for_not_accommodating_my_aunts_diet_rules/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was told it was a barbecue, was in gc with all the information, was she magically expecting everyone to guess she suddenly have a new diet? You had every right to tell her to leave.

Lots of veg are really easy to prepare and BBQ great, from baked potatoes, Greek potatoes , vegetable skewers, sweet corn, sweet potatoes , mushrooms. Just season them with oil, salt and pepper. Lots of good relishes are vegan too, that goes great with meat or BBQ veg\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude42 I find it nearly always gets eaten too.

Until they prove without a doubt that they are an AH. She left no room for doubt. This is all to get attention, to cause a scene, to monger some drama. Good for you for standing up for yourself! Especially since this is your house, you had every right to kick her out.", "NTA.  Not sure how you ended up walking her to the door. Seems like there are some things being left out.

And that's fine. But it's nobody's responsibility but hers to satisfy those preferences.\n\nThis is particularly true when planning a gathering. Any accommodations made to her also impact the rest of the people attending. She even could have brought something herself to share that would have been ok with her.\n\nI'm unsure what to think of the idea that she used the term \"hate crime\" here. Clearly makes no sense.\n\nYou make it sound like she was making a scene over this. If true, no issue with asking her to leave YOUR HOME.\n\nAnd it's also ok for your other family members to be upset. That's human.
