Because this will be the first child of this generation on my family\u2019s side we wanted to make sure all the announcements were special. We wanted to tell my parents first since we knew this would be a big deal. We had planned to do something for Mother\u2019s Day as it was the following weekend after we received our first ultrasound pictures! Unfortunately, trying to schedule this without tipping off my parents was difficult and it ended up being pushed back a week. During that time my boyfriend slipped to a few of his family members. \n\nWe did a cute reveal for my parents and they were excited but I could tell my mom was hurt that some of his family members knew before she did.\n\nWe are getting close to our anatomy scan and we are super excited to find out the gender of our baby! We want to find out privately and then host a reveal party for family. We had planned on doing this party a month after finding out not only to put together a registry but also so my brother, who is military, would be able to attend. \n\nMy mother called me asking when my anatomy scan was. Me not thinking anything of it told her when it was scheduled for. She then started rambling on about plans she had for gender reveals and things she \u201cneeds\u201d to buy and \u201cplanning\u201d that she needs to do. I stopped her and said she wouldn\u2019t be finding out the gender of the baby until we did our party a month later. She flipped out saying I was being disrespectful towards her and that \u201ckeeping something like this from your mother isn\u2019t something you do\u201d. She even brought up that other people found out I was pregnant before her and she had to wait till I was much further along then finding out immediately. I don\u2019t really like confrontation so I laughed it off while explaining how a gender reveal party works and what we had planned. She then said she was excited to be the \u201cholder of the gender\u201d and wanted to surprise us and see our reactions, that this screws up everything she wanted to plan. She then demanded if we were going to do things this way we plan the party for the day after the anatomy scan. I wouldn\u2019t mind readjusting the date but nothing that close would work for us and what we need to have done prior to planning the party. There was also the concern of wanting to wait till my brother could be in town which not only my mother but my father flipped out on saying not to rely on him to even show up. I\u2019ve never seen my brother as unreliable before and with how excited he was to be an uncle I don\u2019t see how they are so upset over this fact. My mother even went on to say that she\u2019s the grandparent to which I responded that he\u2019s the uncle he\u2019s family and he wanted to be there and she didn\u2019t seem to care. \n\nI feel like this is putting a lot of stress on me and making a problem that doesn\u2019t need to exist.", "created_utc": 1688247517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o6hpv/aita_for_not_telling_my_mom_the_gender_of_my_baby/", "score": 603, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Gender is a social construct. You might have a girl who is a tomboy for example, these CHOICES are gender expression. We choose to express our gender through clothing, makeup, jewelry, etc etc. We do not choose our sex. You can look at gender expression around the world and see how it is not synonymous with sex. In India there are three genders, in many cultures there are more than two, and in the US there are so many more than three genders its funny that people still dont understand that gender has nothing to do with sex and vice versa.\n\nIm not trying to be an asshole. Just wanted you to know that no one will know the gender for a while, especially if you just push \"girls wear dresses and boys wear pants\" stuff on your child, even your child will need time to understand and really choose their gender expression. \n\nHere come the downvotes? Dont shoot the messenger! lol. but seriously. gender and sex are not synonymous and understanding the difference might lead to more acceptance and peace in the world. One can only hope. \n\nCongratulations on having a unique human being to raise and watch grow that came from your loins! I hope you give them space to find out who they are so they dont end up people pleasing. \n\nSorry if you are offended, but these parties should be called sex reveal parties, bc its causing a lot of confusion in certain parts of the country, the ones that scream, there are only two genders!

Keep your gender reveal date & plan the party like you originally wanted to. \n\nAlso, an anatomy scan is just that, scanning the anatomy of your baby, who may or may not cooperate with the ultrasound tech being able to identify every body part. So you may not even be able to learn the gender at that time. I did a genetic blood test around 10 weeks I believe, then learned the results (including the gender) around 12 weeks.

Sorry your mom is making your pregnancy all about what she wants. Hopefully she is just so excited right now, she is taking a break from basic manners and will come back down to earth soon.", "NTA.  Say I don\u2019t have energy for all your bullshit.  If you want to share this experience with me, you cannot make demands. Goodbye. And then go radio silent.  She will come around or she won\u2019t.  My dad always says\u201dshe will cool off in the same water she got hot in\u201d", "NTA does your mom have a long standing habit of making everything about herself? Or is it just hurt feelings because she feels like she should have been the first to know? Either way it\u2019s your pregnancy, your baby, and it\u2019s okay for you to set boundaries. Ask her if it\u2019s some family tradition no one informed you of that grandma gets to make all decisions for the new mother, and if that\u2019s so you\u2019re starting your own traditions. Your baby, your decisions. Hope your mom chills out a little.", "NTA since the beginning of time until just recently you did not find out the gender until the baby was born.  So, there is no standard of when to tell people.  When you are at the clinic tell them that you do not want to know and want the images sent at a later date and to whom you want them sent.", "NTA  If your mom wants to plan a gender reveal party, tell her she can get a job as a party planner, or she can have her own baby. Tbis is your baby, YOUR body, YOUR LIFE. \n\nYour mom is pushing. Now is the time you learn how to push back. Here are three things to do: \n\nFirst, stop thinking of her as the person who made decisions for you for many years, she has a different part to play in your life now, and that part involves her BACKING OFF the plans, lists, shopping and doing things HER WAY.  Her role has changed a great deal, and so has yours.  \n\nSecondly, if you have trouble drawing the line or giving in to your mom, REHEARSE SAYING NO. Rehearse it as much as possible. Think up scenarios in your head that are likely (shouldn't be hard, it's your mom) and imagine having conversations where you stand up and tell her NO. Rehearse in the car, while folding laundry, making dinner, in the shower. Every minute you think about it, REHEARSE.  This prepares your brain so when the situation arises, it's almost automatic that the word NO just falls off your tongue and you don't really even have to think. It's hard to describe, but I was timid and couldn't handle these situations for YEARS and couldn't say no until I started rehearsing, now it's so much easier!  \n\nThird and MOST important STAND FIRM on your decision. If someone pulls a sneak attack, you leave immediately. If they blindside you in public, you extricate as soon as possible. Give the person CONSEQUENCES for trying to usurp YOUR pregnancy plans, and stick to them. Go low contact if necessary until the person can treat you and your pregnancy with respect.\n\nAnd congratulations OP! You'll be great! Let hubby know how things are, and totally enlist his help. Teamwork is so helpful!", "The whole \"your partner's parents knew before your parents\" viewpoint is, quite frankly, immature.\n\nI also don't get knowing the sex of the baby before it is born.  It's like knowing what a gift is before receiving it.  It spoils the surprise.\n\nJust tell them all to get back in their lanes, and stop bugging you.  They do not deserve any special privileges for being relatives of one sort or another.  It is your baby, not theirs.\n\nNTA OP.", "NTA so is your mom having the baby or are you?  You need to set boundaries now or it will only get worse as I'm sure she already plans on being in the room when the baby is born.", "You should tell her this: \"The doctor's office called, they had to reschedule our anatomy scan for some reason. The appointment is now on [day before your gender reveal party].\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nSet firm boundaries now with your mother. If she's pushing it this much now it won't stop. Likely, as you've stated you don't like conflict, she's probably used to getting her way when it comes to you and wasn't/isn't expecting this kind of pushback. \n\nPersonally, I'd tell them if they aren't satisfied with your plans that's fine, but *you* are and are going to proceed with them. They can choose to be a part of it or not.", "Y T A, for using \u201cgender\u201d instead of sex. You\u2019re finding out the sex of the baby. In terms of your mom though, absolutely NTA.", "I like this answer. Succinct, accurate, and kind.\n\n\nHopefully mom's just excited, and this isn't a precedent. OP, can you sit down with your mom and have an honest conversation? Basically explain what you did here?\n\nAnd then if she isn't about it, might need low contact for a bit to focus on you, edit: ~~husband~~ bf, and the little one. Congratulations by the way!!!", "Exactly! What would she have done if OP had decided to not find out the gender? Then she would have to wait until bub was born!", "This and every time she fusses tel her that she is pushing boundaries and that if she keeps it up she will start being the last to learn everything.", "\u201cBut I\u2019m the Grandma!\u201d\n\u201cYeah I am the mom.\u201d\n\u201cWell I raised you and I did a good job! Look how you turned out!\u201d\n\u201cYes you raised me and I am grateful but I have my own ideas on parenting and living my own life and will ask for advice if needed.\u201d", "And to that part about canceling the party is she doesn't stop I'd make sure that everyone on both sides knows she's the reason they have to wait.", "Yup.   Back in the day we just gave baby clothes in green, yellow, and prints.  \n\nMy firstborn turned out to be a daughter, the first grandchild and niece on both sides,  and we got sooooo many ruffly pink dresses after she was born.  So many.  With buttons up the back, sob.\n\nAnd they grew up to be genderqueer!", "I mean I\u2019m currently pregnant with my third, and we haven\u2019t found out the gender any of the times. Out of all my friends who have had babies over the last 10yrs only one has had a baby shower, and no one has had a gender reveal. Most of us have had a last catch up a couple of weeks before we\u2019re due, but at no point has that involved presents or registries.\n\nThere\u2019s definitely lots of places around the world where gender reveals and baby showers are just not a big deal.", "We didn\u2019t find out with either of our kids until they arrived. With the first one it was in part because she was being stubborn and would have required coming in for an additional scan. I waffled for longer on the second one but my husband pointed out that if I wasn\u2019t sure I wouldn\u2019t regret not knowing early. And he was right - no regrets for either baby and lots of clothes in every colour!", "NTA. I actually agree that I can understand her being hurt that your SO let it slip to other family first but it\u2019s done now and it was not done purposely to spite her. In the end, it is your decision and you wanted to do a special announcement. She probably did not need to know who had been told when. \n\nAs for the gender reveal, this is your first child and you will only get this chance once. Do it the way you want to do it. She is the grandmother, not the mother, and needs to know that she is overstepping here.", "Exactly.  OP's family is her husband and expecting child.  Mom is a relative.  That's what marriage is.", "Some people do it as a reveal for the parents, other people do it as a reveal for their family/friends.", "This. They drive me bonkers. You\u2019re not finding out your child\u2019s gender, you\u2019re finding out their junk and then throwing a party about it so people can give your baby stuff based on their genitals. It\u2019s weird af.", "Thank you! I appreciate you saying this.", "Thank you!", "Gender and Sex are the same thing.", "There are 2 genders.", "And then follow thru.  No consequences make it a suggestion not a boundary.", "NTA\n\nStop sharing information with your mom, even when she asks.\n\nContinue with YOUR plans and YOUR timelines.\n\nHave your partner run interference if necessary as you don't need the extra stress.\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy.", "NAH, but I just want to say something and I know judging by the comments I will be down voted but here i go anyway. \n\n\nNone of us no the other dynamics of your relationship with your mom. Maybe she is overbearing and controlling and this is just another in a long line of attempts to run your life. If so, follow everyone's suggestions and hold fast. \n\n\nIf not, you say this is your family's 1st grandchild. And that you want it all to be \"special\" for all of you.  \n\n\nYour mom isn't feeling very special right now. She's a little in her feelings about you not telling her 1st. \n\n\nBut mostly she's excited and has plans. I know this is your baby and you have no obligation to do what your mom wants. And healthy boundaries are good. But maybe there is a way to include her? Or another event she can plan. Talk to her. \n\n\nShe is your mom. \n\n\nUnless she's shit.

You were a bit of an arse about when you told her you were pregnant... your plans were not to tell anyone until you had her pregnancy reveal but your boyfriend let the cat out of the bag... that was the point you should've just rung her.  But even then, that makes your mom entitled...  Just because she thinks she should be the first to know, doesn't mean you think the same.\n\nYour next problem is going to be your mom wanting to be at your birth and then telling you how to parent.
