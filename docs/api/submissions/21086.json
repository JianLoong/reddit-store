Because this will be the first child of this generation on my family\u2019s side we wanted to make sure all the announcements were special. We wanted to tell my parents first since we knew this would be a big deal. We had planned to do something for Mother\u2019s Day as it was the following weekend after we received our first ultrasound pictures! Unfortunately, trying to schedule this without tipping off my parents was difficult and it ended up being pushed back a week. During that time my boyfriend slipped to a few of his family members. \n\nWe did a cute reveal for my parents and they were excited but I could tell my mom was hurt that some of his family members knew before she did.\n\nWe are getting close to our anatomy scan and we are super excited to find out the gender of our baby! We want to find out privately and then host a reveal party for family. We had planned on doing this party a month after finding out not only to put together a registry but also so my brother, who is military, would be able to attend. \n\nMy mother called me asking when my anatomy scan was. Me not thinking anything of it told her when it was scheduled for. She then started rambling on about plans she had for gender reveals and things she \u201cneeds\u201d to buy and \u201cplanning\u201d that she needs to do. I stopped her and said she wouldn\u2019t be finding out the gender of the baby until we did our party a month later. She flipped out saying I was being disrespectful towards her and that \u201ckeeping something like this from your mother isn\u2019t something you do\u201d. She even brought up that other people found out I was pregnant before her and she had to wait till I was much further along then finding out immediately. I don\u2019t really like confrontation so I laughed it off while explaining how a gender reveal party works and what we had planned. She then said she was excited to be the \u201cholder of the gender\u201d and wanted to surprise us and see our reactions, that this screws up everything she wanted to plan. She then demanded if we were going to do things this way we plan the party for the day after the anatomy scan. I wouldn\u2019t mind readjusting the date but nothing that close would work for us and what we need to have done prior to planning the party. There was also the concern of wanting to wait till my brother could be in town which not only my mother but my father flipped out on saying not to rely on him to even show up. I\u2019ve never seen my brother as unreliable before and with how excited he was to be an uncle I don\u2019t see how they are so upset over this fact. My mother even went on to say that she\u2019s the grandparent to which I responded that he\u2019s the uncle he\u2019s family and he wanted to be there and she didn\u2019t seem to care. \n\nI feel like this is putting a lot of stress on me and making a problem that doesn\u2019t need to exist.", "created_utc": 1688247517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o6hpv/aita_for_not_telling_my_mom_the_gender_of_my_baby/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whether mom's mom needs to buy blue or pink Made in China tat is irrelevant.", "NTA. There will be plenty of other decisions she hates in the future. Feel free to remind her that this is your kid, and that pissing you off is unlikely to get her what she wants. She had her turn, this one is yours.\n\n  \n\n\nThis is great practice for setting and holding boundaries.", "NTA, your mom is being selfish. It's great she wants to be included, but she needs to respect your plans and wishes.", "NTA you need to remind your mother this is about you and your husband. What she wants has absolutely no bearing on your experience. This is a great time to establish the boundaries you'll need after your child is born.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t set some boundaries now it will only get worse when the baby comes.", "NTA\n\nHowever I can see why she\u2019d be hurt because your SO let it slip to some of his family.\n\nAt that point I would have called it a wash and just let everyone know.\n\nHowever, I suggest a sit down with her face to face with you and your SO.\nYou need to let her know that there will be PLENTY of decisions made in the future about your child that she will disagree with. She needs to understand her role is that of a grandmother, not a secondary parent. So she needs to keep the comments to herself.\nAdvice will be solicited from her as needed.", "NTA; she\u2019s disappointed that her expectations of having some weird power and privilege were inaccurate and she\u2019s taking it out on you", "NTA\n\nYou both have different expectations of the role of the family in (ultimately) meaningless parts of the pregnancy journey.\n\nFor the gender reveal, you both have different ideas about how they work. She's upset that it's not going her way (with her as a special secret keeper). You have no obligation to tell anyone the gender of your baby before its birth, let alone before the gender reveal party. \n\nWhile it sucks that others heard about pregnancy before she did, that's life. Who gets to be the first to know? What harm comes from learning this news a week after someone else?

Seems like they are saying anything just to get you to reveal the gender.", "NTA, its your business, not hers. period.\n\nbut also, dont hate me! you dont know the gender of your baby, you know the sex maybe, but not the gender. Gender is a social construct. You might have a girl who is a tomboy for example, these CHOICES are gender expression. We choose to express our gender through clothing, makeup, jewelry, etc etc. We do not choose our sex. You can look at gender expression around the world and see how it is not synonymous with sex. In India there are three genders, in many cultures there are more than two, and in the US there are so many more than three genders its funny that people still dont understand that gender has nothing to do with sex and vice versa.\n\nIm not trying to be an asshole. Just wanted you to know that no one will know the gender for a while, especially if you just push \"girls wear dresses and boys wear pants\" stuff on your child, even your child will need time to understand and really choose their gender expression. \n\nHere come the downvotes? Dont shoot the messenger! lol. but seriously. gender and sex are not synonymous and understanding the difference might lead to more acceptance and peace in the world. One can only hope. \n\nCongratulations on having a unique human being to raise and watch grow that came from your loins! I hope you give them space to find out who they are so they dont end up people pleasing. \n\nSorry if you are offended, but these parties should be called sex reveal parties, bc its causing a lot of confusion in certain parts of the country, the ones that scream, there are only two genders! Like, no Dale, thats sex and even that isnt true, intersex people exist and are not mistakes. K byeeeeeeee", "NTA.\nFirst of all congratulation for your pregnancy!\nAbout your situation, it sounds like you have bigger problems than just: \"I don't want to let my mom know the gender of the baby until the gender reveal party\".\nNo one is entitled to know about your baby except you and your boyfriend.\nBeing excited to be a grandmother is ok, but that doesnt give her the right to overstep your choices as the mother of your child.\nYou need to have a talk with your boyfriend regarding your mother attitude, and work as a team.\nSet your boundaries now and make her understand that YOU are the mother.\nIf you let her trample over you once, she'll do it again and again if she think that you're not a 'good mother' while raising your child.\nTalk to her with your boyfriend, and if she continue to stand her ground, maybe go LC/NC for a while it's best.\nAlso collect info about grandparents rights in your country. I know that may seem exaggerated,but I have read many stories about it that I cant help but be a little worried about you.\nGood luck!", "I have 6 grandchildren.  Out of those,  2 I knew for sure I was NOT told first.  (My daughter told my sister, and she helped come up with ideas to tell me; my son,  and then DIL, told both Moms together.  Her mom is a hair stylist, and she was cutting my hair in her home) \n\nThe other 4....no idea if I was first or not.  Never occurred to me to ask.  Never even cared.  I was just very happy! (And a bit surprised when both my daughters and son/DIL were all three having babies within a couple of months of each other!)  \n\nAs for Reveals.  Not one had a Reveal party.  I was either there for the ultrasound or was just told.  Again, I'm not sure if I was first to know when I was told or not.  \n\nMom needs to step back and allow you and your husband to take the lead. And,  if she needs to be told that,  so be it.", "NTA your mom is trying to guilt you into doing what she wants.  She can demand anything she wants but at the end of the day she isn't the baby's mom.  You need to tell her that this is your child and the party will be what you want not what she wants, if she keeps it up you will put her in a time-out because she is acting like a freaking toddler.", "NTA but it sounds like your mother wants something that is hers\u2019 first. The fact that she is so demanding that it is causing you undo stress is where your mother is being an AH.", "NTA\n\nbut to save arguments, tell mum you have rescheduled the scan for the day before the party. Problem solved, unless bf \u201caccidentally\u201c lets slip information again. Both of you need to be in agreement otherwise what\u2019s the point", "NTA its your baby and she is going to find out along with everyone else.", "Kindly but firmy shut this down. It's your baby, your rules. If you don't she will keep doing this forever. Time for boundaries.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't about her. This is YOUR pregnancy, YOUR baby. YOU are the boss. If she can't respect that then she doesn't get any info. Period. I get that she's excited, but that is NO excuse to try and take over and make demands and guilt-trip you when she doesn't get her way. \n\nShe's an adult, she needs to act like it. I suggest talking to her (or even sending her a link here) if she refuses to listen. If that doesn't work then she gets a time-out from any/all info and strong boundaries. She's had her time as a first-time mom, now it's YOUR turn. You need to do what is best for baby and you.", "NTA. Your mother is exaggerating and being overdramatic. Also gender reveal partys are bullshit as a concept because your chils gender isnt defined by their genitals but thats a different topic", "NTA, but making a big deal about things that are not. You say she is making a problem where there is none, but you are doing the same. It's a gender reveal party, that is all. It doesn't have to be perfect. If God forbids, something goes wrong, you will see how little all that matters. Focus on taking care of you and your baby. I bet you that an uneventful birth and a healthy baby is actually the best that can happen to you.", "NTA, but.....\n\nThis post is really written to make your mom seem like a lunatic.  Maybe she is a lunatic, but a lot of this is could be coming from the fact that she found out so late about your pregnancy.  IME most women tell their own mother that they are pregnant early on and waiting until the end of the first trimester does not apply to the maternal grandmother.  \n\nIn your particular situation I think there is also a real concern that your boyfriend will blab and your mother will again be the last to know.  Which would likely cause a lot of drama.\n\nSo much of the right answer here depends on your personal relationship with your mother.  You seem to be very focused on making things fair and IME the maternal grandmother is more often than not in on the secret earlier than everyone else.", "NTA.\n\nI would however keep in mind that your mother wants information in different ways and amounts than you want to give her.\n\nCute announcements and parties are fine but they aren\u2019t for your parents- they are because you want them. Your mother isn\u2019t going to have the supportive reaction you want when you surprise her with these types of gestures. \n\nKeep in mind your own needs and keep those a priority, if it\u2019s just a matter of changing how you approach things mentally.", "YTA for having a gender reveal.
