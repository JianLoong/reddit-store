Because this will be the first child of this generation on my family\u2019s side we wanted to make sure all the announcements were special. We wanted to tell my parents first since we knew this would be a big deal. We had planned to do something for Mother\u2019s Day as it was the following weekend after we received our first ultrasound pictures! Unfortunately, trying to schedule this without tipping off my parents was difficult and it ended up being pushed back a week. During that time my boyfriend slipped to a few of his family members. \n\nWe did a cute reveal for my parents and they were excited but I could tell my mom was hurt that some of his family members knew before she did.\n\nWe are getting close to our anatomy scan and we are super excited to find out the gender of our baby! We want to find out privately and then host a reveal party for family. We had planned on doing this party a month after finding out not only to put together a registry but also so my brother, who is military, would be able to attend. \n\nMy mother called me asking when my anatomy scan was. Me not thinking anything of it told her when it was scheduled for. She then started rambling on about plans she had for gender reveals and things she \u201cneeds\u201d to buy and \u201cplanning\u201d that she needs to do. I stopped her and said she wouldn\u2019t be finding out the gender of the baby until we did our party a month later. She flipped out saying I was being disrespectful towards her and that \u201ckeeping something like this from your mother isn\u2019t something you do\u201d. She even brought up that other people found out I was pregnant before her and she had to wait till I was much further along then finding out immediately. I don\u2019t really like confrontation so I laughed it off while explaining how a gender reveal party works and what we had planned. She then said she was excited to be the \u201cholder of the gender\u201d and wanted to surprise us and see our reactions, that this screws up everything she wanted to plan. She then demanded if we were going to do things this way we plan the party for the day after the anatomy scan. I wouldn\u2019t mind readjusting the date but nothing that close would work for us and what we need to have done prior to planning the party. There was also the concern of wanting to wait till my brother could be in town which not only my mother but my father flipped out on saying not to rely on him to even show up. I\u2019ve never seen my brother as unreliable before and with how excited he was to be an uncle I don\u2019t see how they are so upset over this fact. My mother even went on to say that she\u2019s the grandparent to which I responded that he\u2019s the uncle he\u2019s family and he wanted to be there and she didn\u2019t seem to care. \n\nI feel like this is putting a lot of stress on me and making a problem that doesn\u2019t need to exist.", "created_utc": 1688247517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o6hpv/aita_for_not_telling_my_mom_the_gender_of_my_baby/", "score": 1000, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Gender is a social construct. You might have a girl who is a tomboy for example, these CHOICES are gender expression. We choose to express our gender through clothing, makeup, jewelry, etc etc. We do not choose our sex. You can look at gender expression around the world and see how it is not synonymous with sex. In India there are three genders, in many cultures there are more than two, and in the US there are so many more than three genders its funny that people still dont understand that gender has nothing to do with sex and vice versa.\n\nIm not trying to be an asshole. Just wanted you to know that no one will know the gender for a while, especially if you just push \"girls wear dresses and boys wear pants\" stuff on your child, even your child will need time to understand and really choose their gender expression. \n\nHere come the downvotes? Dont shoot the messenger! lol. but seriously. gender and sex are not synonymous and understanding the difference might lead to more acceptance and peace in the world. One can only hope. \n\nCongratulations on having a unique human being to raise and watch grow that came from your loins! I hope you give them space to find out who they are so they dont end up people pleasing. \n\nSorry if you are offended, but these parties should be called sex reveal parties, bc its causing a lot of confusion in certain parts of the country, the ones that scream, there are only two genders!

Keep your gender reveal date & plan the party like you originally wanted to. \n\nAlso, an anatomy scan is just that, scanning the anatomy of your baby, who may or may not cooperate with the ultrasound tech being able to identify every body part. So you may not even be able to learn the gender at that time. I did a genetic blood test around 10 weeks I believe, then learned the results (including the gender) around 12 weeks.

Here are three things to do: \n\nFirst, stop thinking of her as the person who made decisions for you for many years, she has a different part to play in your life now, and that part involves her BACKING OFF the plans, lists, shopping and doing things HER WAY.  Her role has changed a great deal, and so has yours.  \n\nSecondly, if you have trouble drawing the line or giving in to your mom, REHEARSE SAYING NO. Rehearse it as much as possible. Think up scenarios in your head that are likely (shouldn't be hard, it's your mom) and imagine having conversations where you stand up and tell her NO. Rehearse in the car, while folding laundry, making dinner, in the shower. Every minute you think about it, REHEARSE.  This prepares your brain so when the situation arises, it's almost automatic that the word NO just falls off your tongue and you don't really even have to think. It's hard to describe, but I was timid and couldn't handle these situations for YEARS and couldn't say no until I started rehearsing, now it's so much easier!  \n\nThird and MOST important STAND FIRM on your decision. If someone pulls a sneak attack, you leave immediately. If they blindside you in public, you extricate as soon as possible. Give the person CONSEQUENCES for trying to usurp YOUR pregnancy plans, and stick to them. Go low contact if necessary until the person can treat you and your pregnancy with respect.\n\nAnd congratulations OP! You'll be great! Let hubby know how things are, and totally enlist his help. Teamwork is so helpful!", "The whole \"your partner's parents knew before your parents\" viewpoint is, quite frankly, immature.\n\nI also don't get knowing the sex of the baby before it is born.

Her rights, her party, her grandparent journey. \n\nI suggest you tell her that she is putting too much stress on you to prioritise her feelings above your own and because of that you and DH have decided to go old school and not find out the gender until birth. Tell her she\u2019ll get a baby shower invite when you are ready to have one.", "INFO: Seems kinda weird\u2026 are you not that close with your mom?.. when my friend got pregnant, they told their immediate family members pretty quick and waited for the end of the first trimester to tell the rest of the family.. \nI understand that differences in culture and relationship exist, but I believe we also need more information. \nI definitely think it was wrong for the extended family to find out before your own mother and she was probably hurt.. but she is also overstepping and seems like she wants to be more involved, but you repeatedly shoot her ideas down and probably with good reason\n- even though we have differing cultural norms, NO ONE is allowed or feels entitled to meddling with the plans set out by the new parents!\n\nEnd of the day, its your choice of course!", "NTA. Tell your mother to back off or she can wait 18 years to meet her grandchild.", "NTA. Tell your mom you have your own plans for your baby and for your own celebrations during your pregnancy (emphasis on the YOUR) and that if she and your father continues to stress you out like this which is bad for you and the baby and you will be hanging up on all calls that veer that way in future.", "Neither my mom nor my husbands mom found out the gender until we did the reveal at the baby shower, I was literally like 35 weeks pregnant. You don\u2019t have to tell your mother anything and I\u2019d start telling her less about your pregnancy. She\u2019s acting incredibly entitled.\n\nNTA", "Nta.\n\nYou have a potential r/justnomil here. You need to start setting AND ENFORCING boundaries. Your pregnancy, your baby.

Your boyfriend already screwed up once (maybe twice) by telling a few people. Think you can trust him again? Get the scan, determine the sex, group call both sets of parents and tell them. Done. Or cause stress in everyone\u2019s lives by creating a mountain out of a molehill. You got pregnant. It\u2019s easy, people can do it even by accident! It will be a boy or a girl. At this point you cannot affect that outcome. You didn\u2019t win a Nobel Prize.", "Do evangelicals have something against dinosaurs?\n\n\u2026Asking as an evangelical whose kids love dinosaurs.", "If you were evangelical you'd know dinosaur fossils are from outer space and God put them there to fool people so he could send them to hell like they deserve.", "Where are Dinos in Genesis...? It's not God made the animals, realised He made some mistakes then made better animals. So it would depend on how literal they are. Is the earth billions or thousands of years old?", "Wow. Source, please?", "The word dinosaur isn\u2019t in the Bible because the word dinosaur was invented 200 years ago, long after the Bible was written. The Bible references dinosaurs in different places by different names.\n\nJob 40:15-24, for example, mirrors what we know about sauropod dinosaurs. Incredibly huge creature, tail as massive as a tree, strength in belly and hips, leg bones that were massive and hollow yet rib bones that were fully ossified, living in a lush environment, not bothered by raging waters.\n\n\u201cLook at Behemoth, which I made *along with you* and which feeds on grass like an ox. What strength it has in its loins, what power in the muscles of its belly! Its tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are close-knit. Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like rods of iron. It ranks first among the works of God, yet its Maker can approach it with his sword. The hills bring it their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby. Under the lotus plants it lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh. The lotuses conceal it in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround it. A raging river does not alarm it; it is secure, though the Jordan should surge against its mouth. Can anyone capture it by the eyes, or trap it and pierce its nose?\u201d\n\nAlthough we may differ in belief as to how long ago dinosaurs lived, I can assure you that Christians love dinosaurs too. A dino-themed gift wouldn\u2019t be offensive."]}
