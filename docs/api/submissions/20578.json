Katie also once told Ian to his face that he \"wasted his potential\" (context: Ian was the valedictorian of his high school class, just like Katie) by dropping out of college to help Mom run the family business after Dad passed away. \n\nKatie and Daniel recently posted that Katie is pregnant with twin boys, and their names would be Stanford and Yale. I commented \u201cCongratulations!\u201d but later I texted her to say that it wasn\u2019t right to give the boys ridiculous names that would put them under immense pressure to succeed from a very young age. I also asked her about what would happen if one or both of them weren\u2019t as successful/perfect as she hoped. \n\nKate didn\u2019t like the points that I made. She texted back \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking for opinions, especially from someone like you. Consider yourself uninvited from our wedding until you sincerely apologize.\u201d TBH, I was already leaning towards not attending due to Katie's condescending attitude towards me, but the \"someone like you\" comment sealed the deal.
