I moved away from where they were congregated but someone still saw me take it any way. I tried to brush it off as just my meds and let it go. Being a woman she was well aware it was birth control. She said to me that maybe I need to get off them and think about having children as 'I am not getting any younger.\"\n\nI told her I would rather not have this discussion and went back to the living room, well she followed me in there. She did not let it drop and said that I was keeping my husband from having children and being selfish. At this point everyone was looking at us, I repeated again, this was not a topic for discussion. She did not let it go and started telling me I was only thinking about myself and if he had any thoughts on the matter or even knew I was on it. The rest of the family started questioning why I was taking it 'at my age' when it was a fine time to start a family. My husband stepped in saying once again its not a topic we need to be talking about.\n\nShe then said that why I was making the choice about 'our family' and I snapped. I said that you know nothing about my medical history or why I am even on it. I yelled that she needed to mind her own business and that this conversation was over. They began to call my outburst rude while I was getting more agitated and my husband was trying to tell them all to let it go, as I was trying to. They would not cause I was 'so rude'. I snapped again, stating that I cannot actually carry to term, and doing so would cause great harm to my body, and that my birth control was a measure taken to keep my body on a level field, and that were all extremely judgmental and needed to further educate themselves on why a woman would do something.\n\nI also told them how inappropriate it was to even bring up the topic not knowing my medical history. They continued to say I could have explained it nicely and did not be rude. I said I never at any point need to explain my medical situation to any one that I do not want to. I got up and left the house my husband told them he was disappointed in how they treated me and followed me out.\n\nI am getting messages some apologize and others saying I need to apologize.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681150449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hr0lf/aita_for_telling_my_family_to_mind_their_business/", "score": 350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was rude of your SIL to comment on your meds, rude of them to interrogate you at a family function (or ever!), and rude of them to keep pushing you when you told them repeatedly to drop it.

They were rude and intrusive.", "NTA. They pushed you to the edge and punished you when you snapped. They\u2019re insane. You were not rude cause you said very politely many times that this wasn\u2019t a topic you wanted to talk about. You should have never been forced to explain any of that to anyone.", "NTA I\u2019m genuinely disgusted at your husbands family, the nerve to interrogate someone you\u2019ve seen taking medication at a social gathering and do it in a way that draws so much attention. Absolutely disgusting.", "Nta. You didn't own them a fucking explain, and she was being rude by not minding her business, following you, and dragging the rest of the family into your health situation.", "NTA. From now on, you've got the perfect excuse to skip family time with these intrusive assholes. Just tell them you can't come because you went off BC and are bleeding too heavily to leave the house", "NTA.

Nevertheless, your use of them is absolutely, positively, and unambiguously none of their beeswax. \n\nYou explained that the topic isn't up for discussion, they persisted and then escalated by judging you and calling you selfish, and then you became angry because you had ample reason to be.\n\n\nIt sounds like you and your in-laws are Catholic? If so, you might bear in mind that the Church's teaching on contraception does not forbid its use for a medically therapeutic purpose such as the need to control irregular bleeding. Under the doctrine of double effect, it's okay if your legitimate medical usage of a drug happens to have the additional effect of impairing contraception. For example, it's permissible to have your uterus removed if you're treating cervical or endometrial cancer, even though the surgery makes pregnancy impossible.

That is completely unacceptable. You deserve better then being out in that situation.", "NTA.\n\nThat woman is bloody hateful to stalk you with her own mishigas after you tell her to back off.\n\nUnfortunately, just yelling at them isn't enough. And reasoning with them, even if done in forceful tones, doesn't work, either, because they don't care what you say. They aren't listening.\n\nThe only solution is to hit them with language so tough and offensive--I mean every brutal word in the book--that they back off out of sheer hurt feelings and humiliation.

If anyone pushed me too hard about wanting kids, or when, I perfected the teary eyed, \"can we please not talk about this...\" That usually answered their question while making them feel like an ass. In my early teens it was pretty real, but as the questions got more annoying it became more of an effective act.\n\nJoke was on me when I ended up pregnant. Different doctor double checks original and questions if he had the wrong charts. I can have kids just fine and I now have two of them. Still made for a bucket of trauma for me as a teen.", "Sad part if Clarence Thomas and Republicans have their way, OP and other women who need this to save their lives/health will lose the right to have these meds.
