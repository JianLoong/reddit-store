My sister is 38F. \n\nMy sister\u2019s son is 10 months old. She\u2019s basically a single mother. She works a full-time job and is the breadwinner, and is also the parent who takes care of the baby the most. The father only works part-time as a waiter to focus on his \u201cart\u201d (making music). He says he can\u2019t look after the kid because he\u2019s tired after his part-time job. They are struggling with money and have downgraded to a smaller apartment to save on rent. My mom has been giving them money every month and buying them baby stuff. Me and my mom (mostly my mom) have been helping her take care of the child. She spends a week out of the month over their apartment to help take care of the baby. My mom comes home and I go over there for the next week. We have been alternating like that. It\u2019s taken a toll on my mom\u2019s mental and physical health. I also don\u2019t like it because I feel like I should be focusing on my own life \n\nMy sister is pregnant again. Me and my mom are horrified that she is keeping it. She also announced that she is breaking up with her boyfriend and that he isn\u2019t going to coparent. My mom is nearing retirement and told me she doesn\u2019t want my sister and her kids to depend on her. My mom said she mentally, physically and financially can\u2019t help my sister with raising 2 babies. I also did not sign up for this responsibility. So we set some boundaries with her and told her we won\u2019t be helping as much and if she keeps the baby she needs to figure out the child care by herself. My sister got upset and complained to her auntie (my mom\u2019s sister). Now that side of the family is calling us selfish. Are we the asshole?", "created_utc": 1703794975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t3is2/aita_for_telling_my_pregnant_sister_i_dont_want/", "score": 2909, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's awesome that you will help out but you should not be depended on for long term care. You do have your own life and your sister hooked up with a loser. This is on her and it is wrong for her to assume you will change your life to accommodate her. She needs to get child support from the deadbeat (I know this will be hard) and come to terms with her situation. There are social programs that can help her. Usually county and state services. Look those up.", "NTA.\n\nShe can barely take care of one and she's getting a second one?  Nope. Sorry. She needs to figure it out herself. She wants a village to help, then she needs to understand that the village needs to consent to it.

She is old enough to figure it out herself, it's not like she's a teen mom who doesn't know all the systems etc.", "NTA - call out the other family members very loudly by asking what are they willing to do to help.  Nothing?  How selfish of them.  They can kick rocks.\n\nThis is your sisters mess that she gets to live with.  I'm willing to bet the only reason she felt confident about leaving her BF is because of you and your mom helping out.  It's time for her to be held accountable for her actions.

Your auntie has a great opportunity to demonstrate selflessness by taking care of the new baby, supporting your sister and her kids financially, or otherwise stepping up to help.", "NTA.\n\nFiguring out childcare is 100% the parents responsibility.  Full stop.  While it is nice to have family chip in, they should never be obligated to care for the children.  Anyone in your family who is criticizing you doesn't have a leg to stand on unless they are planning to help with childcare.   \n\nYou and your mom need to focus on your and your mom.  Your sister needs to figure things out for her kids.", "NTA. Father needs to step up or pay up.

Then she broke up with her non contributing boyfriend.\n\nHer taking care of her children is not you or your mom's problem.

This ain\u2019t your circus, ain\u2019t your monkeys.", "That whole side of the family can step up and help her! Stop buying her baby things. Both you and your mom need to agree that 1 of you will watch the baby 1 day week for 8 hours max. Long enough for her to go to dr appointments or grocery shop or clean the house. That is more appropriate level of help!", "It\u2019s so generous of your aunt to ( checks notes) offer no help but criticize you for wanting to help less.  NTA", "Nta, your sister and her husband are obviously taking advantage of you and your mom. The only thing that will stop them from doing so is if you disconnect from the situation. You are not responsible for your sister's irresponsible behavior.", "OP, you and your mom had no role in your sister's decision to get pregnant, so why does any of the responsibility therefrom fall on you?

I suggest you move away for 2 years and let it all sort itself out.", "NTA\n\nI love babies and I\u2019d be happy to help family and friends with their babies when they need help, but that is not a full time or permanent solution.  Grandmas are there for the occasional Friday night or a last minute emergency.  They aren\u2019t obligated to be full time caregivers unless they 100% want to be.  Your sister needs to get a plan together and fast before she\u2019s trying to find daycare for two kids instead of one.", "First off, your NTA. \n\nYou clearly care about your family. \n\nWhat I find funny is how much of an opinion the rest of your family seems to have. Did they ask how YOU or your mom have been holding up? Whether or not you've been able to handle your own financial responsibilities while helping your sister out? If not, it's rather rude of them to shove their opinions down your throat without trying a bit harder to find ways THEY can help your sisters family, and make things easier on everyone. \n\nIf their not helping find a solution, tell them to bugger off.", "NTA - Your sister needs to do the hard thing and really put herself and her kids first without using you and your mom as rungs on a ladder. Take the father of the kids to court, get custody and get him to pay child support. Bet he\u2019ll get a full time job and start pulling his weight if the alternative is jail time and no more music gigs\u2026. She\u2019s going to need to start looking into what help from the city/county/state she can get. It\u2019s super nice that you and your mom have helped out, but just like her baby daddy has been taking advantage of her, she\u2019s been taking advantage of you all. It\u2019s not a surprise that raising kids is hard, time consuming and expensive. We live in a day and age where if you can\u2019t afford to have a baby with both time and money (and have a partner who\u2019s helping/pitching in) then don\u2019t. And if you do go ahead with it, then that\u2019s on you and no one else. Might be harsh but that\u2019s my take.", "NTA. Well I guess the family who is mad at you is going to spend all their time and money helping her then, right\u2026right?", "Tell that side of the family to step up then.

Anyone complaining is welcome to step up and take your place. What a mess!", ">Now that side of the family is calling us selfish. \n\nNTA. Tell that side of the family that they can give your sister money and babysit for countless hours if they like.", "NTA  Your relatives must be lining up to step in and help her raise the kids, right?  Right???  Because every time they call you selfish, you should say, \"Well, I guess I am.  How kind of you to be helping her out.\" and when they ask WTF you're talking about ask them \"Well, aren't YOU going to be helping her out?  Or are you selfish, too?\"", "I actually have sympathy for her difficult situation, but she needs to figure it out herself. If he\u2019s not going to coparent, he\u2019s going to pay child support. In most states they can base it on his POTENTIAL income, meaning working part time is not an excuse to pay less-he\u2019ll be expected to work full-time. When she files with the child support bureau, she can also apply with family assistance for TANF (they\u2019ll pay cash while they go after him for child support) and childcare assistance (if she\u2019s working full-time, she\u2019ll qualify). \n\nThere are ways for single moms to survive without expecting family to supplement their income and provide free childcare. NTA.", "NTA and wow. Because I\u2019m petty I would remind her the child has a father and he can be the primary caregiver. Being a single dad is a thing. If she doesn\u2019t want that, she has 8 months to line up childcare with auntie and the cousins.", "NTA. It's not up to you to pay for someone else's life choices.", "I really don\u2019t understand why ANYONE who is already struggling to look after one child financially and/or physically would CHOOSE to have another. \n\nI have one child. We could not afford to bring another child into the world so didn\u2019t.", "Your sister has made some bad decisions, but they\u2019re not your responsibility or your mom\u2019s to fix.  Your sister may need to place the child for adoption.  This is not your problem to fix.\n\nAs for other family members calling you out - I would flat out tell them, until you\u2019re taken care of her child every day for X months (your choice), you get no say about me.  ZERO.  I\u2019ve done plenty of heavy lifting here already, and I don\u2019t remember seeing you showing up for your shift.  So hush up.", "NTA, if the rest if the family think you are selfish, they should totally volunteer to help instead.", "NTA. Your sis and her baby daddy are TAH. So are all the relatives who are calling you and your mom selfish. If they feel that way and care so much then let them babysit every other week and give sis money. Especially that aunt who\u2019s all up in arms about you and your mom. She can put up or shut up.", "NTA - but the good news for all of you is that any and every single person calling you selfish is automatically volunteering to help your sister in you and your mother\u2019s stead. So that\u2019s a win-win. If they try to back down - literally use their own words back at them.", "NTA\n\nWhen someone calls you selfish, tell them to lend a hand.

That is selfish.", "NTA. Auntie can help her with the kids.", "NTA\n\nAt ALL.\n\nEverything you said is right.

Hey, if the other side of the family wants to interrupt their lives taking care of her and her children, they can get to it. Did she just think things will magically work out by having another baby and ejecting her SO? She is choosing a very difficult path for her and her children regardless of having help from her aging mother and brother.", "I think she is being really unfair to you. You and your mother have helped so much. I would ask her how she can justify calling you guys selfish. I find it unreasonable and rude to make other people feel bad because they don\u2019t want to take over your responsibilities. I think it is mean to post things publicly when you\u2019re having a disagreement with someone. Why is everyone throwing shade your way? Are they taking actions to help her? NTA.", "My definition of selfish is having another baby when you aren\u2019t able to take care of the first one, expecting to dump the extra burden on the people who have been helping you out.", "NTA, but a bit naive. You enabled her through the first one. Remember, we teach people how to treat us. She now thinks she\u2019s got lifelong support as she pops out babies. Don\u2019t give in anymore, please.

Stop helping her. Tell your mom to stop helping her and lending her money. Neither of you are a free bank let alone a free daycare. Stop enabling your sisters deplorable and inconsiderate behaviour. Just because she has kids doesn\u2019t mean you or anyone else are obligated to help, especially financially. Your sister made her bed and now she has to lay in it.

Your sister is making choices. It's only fair to her to let her know up front what she needs to be preparing for with another child on the way.

They are struggling with money and have downgraded to a smaller apartment to save on rent. My mom has been giving them money every month and buying them baby stuff. Me and my mom (mostly my mom) have been helping her take care of the child. She spends a week out of the month over their apartment to help take care of the baby. My mom comes home and I go over there for the next week. We have been alternating like that. It\u2019s taken a toll on my mom\u2019s mental and physical health. I also don\u2019t like it.\n\nMy sister is pregnant again. Me and my mom are horrified that she is keeping it. She also announced that she is breaking up with her boyfriend and that he isn\u2019t going to coparent.
