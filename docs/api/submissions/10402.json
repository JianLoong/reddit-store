Mercy.", "Nta that's really rude of them.

Everyone else was paying for themselves, why can't she? People like this make me furious.", "why were you expected to pay for it? that makes no sense. if girl couldn't pay for herself then her *friend who invited her* should have. \n\nno you're NTA. so who ended up paying?", "NTA. The friend was pushing it expecting you to pay for their meal. The friend\u2019s friend was just fucking crazy.", "NTA - I'm not sure they're your friend so much as a \"meal ticket\" friend.", "NTA. \n\nIt seems like everyone understood that they were each expected to pay for their own meals. There was no earthly reason for anyone to expect you to pay for them.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy wouild you pay dfor your firend's guests? No reason to do that. HE can, if he wants to. Or not.
