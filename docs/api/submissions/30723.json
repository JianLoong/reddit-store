And do you know if his money is tied up in ventures that he may not be able to access at the time?  2). You calling him an \"deadbeat\" means you think just because he is your brother, your children's Uncle and rich, that he is \"suppose\" to financially support your family when asked.  The definition of a deadbeat is: ***one who persistently fails to pay personal debts or expenses***.

The context here is crucial to deciding if he was sexist or not, i mean for all we know op could have said a bunch of times in the past that he really wants sons, which would completely change the context and therefore meaning of what the brother said and the brother could be saying because it changes it from \"oh, poor you having so many daughters, cause girls are such a pain to raise\" to \"hey congratulations buddy, you've got 3 lovely daughters plus you got  son just like you always wanted\" and it drastically impacts the perception of the brother. Short of anymore information i rewlly don't think it's fair to call the brother a sexist just off that comment alone.

No. If you say yes, you're lying. He's sexist.", "Right? If they\u2019re struggling bc you\u2019re having kids, maybe they shouldn\u2019t have anymore.

Why would they think they\u2019d be better off financially with a kid when the economy is shit? It\u2019s really simple. Don\u2019t have kids if you can\u2019t afford them, not with the way this country is going.\n\nNow, I believe in eating the rich. Fuck billionaires, multi millionaires. But the brother expecting, demanding money from his brother who has a bit more money? That\u2019s rude af. I\u2019m seriously doubting OP asked in a nice way. We don\u2019t even know if the brother is rich or just better off bc he doesn\u2019t have kids, or simply has a bette4 job. I wouldn\u2019t doubt OP is being hyperbolic a bit.\n\nThat comment about the sexes is gross af too. Yuck.\n\nAnyways they both sound like insufferable AH\u2019s.

Most married couples don't consider these as options, so it was a lousy comment.\n\nBro just should have said No I won't loan you money(and yes calling Bro deadbeat and other stuff does indicate that OP is an entitled AH).  Bro is AH for making procreative comments when they do no good."]}
