This sounds like a stressful situation but JFC take some responsibility. Punishing your roommates by withholding a utility is absurd.

With the WiFi they really should pitch in with the cost. I doubt they would pay for it though, seems like they want to make a point about something.", "YTA. \n1) sometimes people cannot drop their life just because you had a problem.

What did I do? I called a locksmith and got mad at myself for my stupid moment. Not them \n\n2) do they need the WIFi? Specially the person that said they don't need it. Why are you forcing them to have the Wifi? \nYou are forcing them to get stuff they don't want. \nAre they stuff you need? Then get them for yourself but don't be surprised if they fight you or are not receptive.\n\nAt the end you might find that perhaps they are not a good fit for you to live with them.

So you screwed up and you want to punish your roommates cause they didn't jump to your commands.

They may get themselves a new roommate and rightfully so.", "YTA. You claim it\u2019s not about being locked out, but it clearly is. Being an adult means dealing with your own problems.

I would have gone after the landlord more since it\u2019s their job to have someone available to get you in the apartment if locked out.

I think it\u2019s time you focused on yourself. I get that you mean splitting things is easier and cheaper but you honestly can\u2019t give yourself more headache over this. They\u2019re showing you that you aren\u2019t a friend or even a liked roommate to them. Focus on your stuff and then move out when you get the chance", "they literally just moved in when I looked at it, I am not gonna judge someone for not having anything literally few days into moving in.

Get your story straight. Was it a month or just after they moved in? Either way they were moved in so a lack of furniture is a dead giveaway. When people move, people move in with their furniture. It doesn't show up a month or two later. But let's get to the real point, why do they get 'punished' if you fucked up? Normally, people who lock themselves out realize they screwed up and accept their responsibility for their error. They don't punish others cause the roommates didn't come running to the command of a crying woman.", "It means that your problems with them will not finish with the current issues.

They paid for it and they're expecting the WiFi to work so they can do their schoolwork. If you want to change the agreement you already had to split the costs for the WiFi, you should discuss it with them instead of randomly doing it and interrupting their usage.\n\nYou locked yourself out.

By refusing to split costs does that mean you alone are covering the cost of the wifi? Does that cost get defrayed elsewhere, like you cover the wifi, someone else covers the water bill...etc? Or They make up for the lack of $$ coverage by handling chores like dish clean up...etc? You mentioned you did wifi and kitchenware, but there's more to an apartment than just those things. \n\nAssuming everyone is contributing in some way, yes, YTA for cutting off access to the wifi.
