Sure, but it's ultimately your responsibility you got locked out and there were other people that could/did help you.\n\nWrt the brewing issues that don't have to deal with you being locked out, I feel like you should move or talk to them/the landlord to work something out. Changing the wifi password is petty, won't resolve any issues, and will just make them more hostile if you were to need their help later.", "YTA in general. If you don't want to share the wifi you're solely paying for or the kitchenware you bought on your own, fine, but you need to get over your issues with them.\n\nYou're being spiteful over something that you admit was your fault. They're not there to be your friend, they're there because three people splitting rent is cheaper than living alone.\n\nIf you want to spend the money to make the place more livable and they don't, that's on you.

I don't think locking yourself out and expecting them to skip class is reasonable. I've sat in the NY winter before because I forgot my key. You were inside lol. They are  assholes  because they should contribute to the house as I said", "YTA. You are 27 years old and blaming others for you locking yourself out? This sounds like a stressful situation but JFC take some responsibility. Punishing your roommates by withholding a utility is absurd. It would be one thing if you asked them to chip in for it, but if you\u2019re not going to allow them access because of this then you\u2019re ridiculous and will have a terrible time living together.", "YWBTA if you stop sharing kitchenware. With the WiFi they really should pitch in with the cost. I doubt they would pay for it though, seems like they want to make a point about something.", "YTA. \n1) sometimes people cannot drop their life just because you had a problem. Being an adult means you have to solve your problems in your own.\nI have locked my self out sometimes and called friends that had the key and they were unable to come at a time that was good for me. What did I do? I called a locksmith and got mad at myself for my stupid moment. Not them \n\n2) do they need the WIFi? Specially the person that said they don't need it. Why are you forcing them to have the Wifi? \nYou are forcing them to get stuff they don't want. \nAre they stuff you need? Then get them for yourself but don't be surprised if they fight you or are not receptive.\n\nAt the end you might find that perhaps they are not a good fit for you to live with them. And that's ok, doesn't make them a bad person.\nOr makes you a bad person for wanting an environment you like.\nWhat makes you TA is forcing them to comply to your standard.", "YTA. You would be shutting off their wifi specifically to punish them for not coming to your rescue. That's being passive aggressive.", "What kind of lock do you have that a random neighbor was able to pick? That doesn\u2019t seem safe at all.", "YWBTA. I remember your post from earlier - that you were gifted the kitchenware by a non-profit and you wanted to stop them from using it, right? \n\nYou messed up and got yourself locked out, it\u2019s not their responsibility to come and get you. \n\nIt\u2019s also not their jobs to furnish communal areas if they don\u2019t want to.", "YTA. So you screwed up and you want to punish your roommates cause they didn't jump to your commands. Sounds like you are the problem roommate and you are complaining about your roommates so you can justify your punishment. Apparently they were able to get along without your help and you are mad that they won't give you money so you can buy things to make your life easier. Watch yourself. They may get themselves a new roommate and rightfully so.", "YTA. You claim it\u2019s not about being locked out, but it clearly is. Being an adult means dealing with your own problems. Grow up a little. They\u2019re paying for the wifi. You were silly enough to lock yourself out. Shit happens.", "YTA. Move out. You want friends. They want someone to help pay rent. It\u2019s not a good fit.", "It makes no sense to change the password, especially since they argued that they don't need it. That's a \"you\" utility, and locking yourself out was a \"you\" problem. Yta", "If you\u2019re changing WiFi cause you locked yourself out without a backup plan, YTA.\n\nAny other reason you need to explain to them that you need help splitting costs or the amenities you\u2019re providing will be off limits, including Wi-Fi.  You shouldn\u2019t have offered anything up until cost splitting was discussed.\n\nAs others have said, this may not be a good fit roommate wise.  But that\u2019s something to determine after another round of discussions.", "YWBTA if you changed the password because of this. You wouldn\u2019t be if it was simply because they don\u2019t pay for it though.", "NTA. Sharing is a two-way street.  Make it so.  No trades, though.   If they share something with you then return the favor.   Removing WiFi is a start.   If no improvement remove your other things that you've donated a bit at a time.   Try to avoid a scene, but don't let them team up on you or walk over you.   A lock on your door might be useful.", "Ywbta because maybe you could have ubered to them and gotten the key. But idk.  Just ignore them and stop buying stuff to share.", "YWBTA. I mean when I moved into an apartment (before I lived in my own home) with shared living space, my roommate had also moved in before I did, and he only furnished his room. Which was fine with me because he never used the living room so I understood why he never cared to furnish it. I did it myself. Also we had separate pots and pans/kitchenware. Maybe you should stop trying to include them in these things if they do not care about them", "Info- are they paying for the Wi-Fi? If so the Y T A, if not, then N T A.\nAlso Just as a point of education, if you were leaving your apartment, your key needs to be in your hands. No ifs, ands, or buts. Even if you think you were just walking out to quickly get something or picking something up right from across the hall from your front door. Do not leave your apartment without your keys.  The supplies no matter if your door automatically locks or not.", "Info:\n\nDo they pay for the wifi?", "You definitely wouldn\u2019t be TA. Since they make no attempt themselves, why should you provide it for them. Your kitchen wares and your Wi-Fi. But I would be looking for a different place to live because I can almost guarantee they will get pissed as hell for you cutting off their mooching access!", "Info: do they pay their share for the WiFi bill?", "because ultimately they are grateful I am providing these things, they are using the WiFi and kitchenware, I am helping myself but also benefiting everyone else who lives here, but I am also resentful that I am making all of this effort and they are not only not being helpful but arguing with me whenever I try to improve our living situation, without providing alternatives. so basically leaving me out stuck with what would have been till midnight in my pajamas without shoes, jacket and a wallet to go anywhere else is the last straw basically specially when I offered to cover cost for rides to make it easier and shorter duration.", "right, a shitty one lol.", "I never said I am getting personal items, I am trying to get basic items like trash and recycling bin for the kitchen because there\u2019s trash all over the apartment, it\u2019s unfair I have to pay for it on my own and also not fair to me to live in that kind of environment.", "Where in the post does it say they are paying for the wifi?", "I am not changing the WiFi password cause I locked myself out, that\u2019s simplifying the issue. If they want to act like complete strangers then I don\u2019t want to share WiFi and kitchenware when they are making zero efforts to share anything with me besides WiFi cost (which I would refund them for) or to make the apartment livable and not covered in trash. Leaving me out till midnight (before neighbor helped) and not trying to help at all even when I tried to make it easier by offering ride cost was the last straw.", "I would\u2019ve loved to lmao, I was barefoot and in my pajama shorts.", "We just got it this week, if I decided to change the password I would\u2019ve refunded them.", "Why did you move in? If it is so obvious, when you looked into this place, cause who doesn't look at an apartment before moving in, did you not see the mess?", "There will prob be another post very soon - WIBTA for not emptying the rubbish and recycle bins that I bought because room mates didn\u2019t want them.", "comments OP states they all pitched in for it this week so she would \u201crefund them\u201d\nwhich tells me they\u2019ve paid if they\u2019re entitled to a refund.", "But they are strangers. Just because you live together doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re friends or even want to be. Sometimes people are just roommates and nothing more. I think you\u2019re trying to force something that they don\u2019t want, that isn\u2019t fair to them.", "Your roommates were in school till late.  I would have gone after the landlord more since it\u2019s their job to have someone available to get you in the apartment if locked out.  It\u2019s not your roommate\u2019s job.\n\nAlso if they are splitting cost of internet then no, you don\u2019t just take control over it unless they aren\u2019t paying you.\n\nYou need to have a talk about expectations and living arrangements (without bringing up the locked out bit, that\u2019s on you).  If they won\u2019t contribute more it\u2019s not going to get better.", "I know I saw that. But don't do change the wifi and be petty. Just let things go and try to be chill with roommates. Its the worst when their is tension between roommates or neighbors. Sending you love. And luck", "Very gently, YWBTA\n\nOnly because if they are paying for it you\u2019ll still need to talk to them about taking them off, changing the password etc.\n\nThat being said, you\u2019ve gone out of your way to make this place better for everyone. I think it\u2019s time you focused on yourself. I get that you mean splitting things is easier and cheaper but you honestly can\u2019t give yourself more headache over this. They\u2019re showing you that you aren\u2019t a friend or even a liked roommate to them. Focus on your stuff and then move out when you get the chance", "they literally just moved in when I looked at it, I am not gonna judge someone for not having anything literally few days into moving in. I signed the lease then moved a month later since I had some flexibility that\u2019s when I realized there was no effort to furnish it and it was full of trash.", "that makes zero sense since not living in filth is my goal.", "I am just so confused, one of them invited me to splitwise and I thought that\u2019s what we were doing but then refused to split costs, and they invited me to stuff before so it seems they\u2019re trying to be friendly, and if I try to communicate about anything they just don\u2019t respond.", "You put in your post that they were living there a month. Get your story straight. Was it a month or just after they moved in? Either way they were moved in so a lack of furniture is a dead giveaway. When people move, people move in with their furniture. It doesn't show up a month or two later. But let's get to the real point, why do they get 'punished' if you fucked up? Normally, people who lock themselves out realize they screwed up and accept their responsibility for their error. They don't punish others cause the roommates didn't come running to the command of a crying woman.", "It means that your problems with them will not finish with the current issues. There will be more. Plenty of them. I can tell this from your response."]}
