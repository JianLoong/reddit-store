Your roommates being unavailable when you needed help has nothing to do with the WiFi.

Sure, change the wifi password, lock up your kitchenware but in the end, you would just be happier if you lived with different people.\n\nNTA", "NTA but they didn't want it in the first place so they should not be affected at all.", ">I understand this was my fault and my roommates had no obligation to help\n\nDo you? Because if you did you wouldn't have made this post. YWBTA.", "YTA. Could they have been more helpful? Sure, but it's ultimately your responsibility you got locked out and there were other people that could/did help you.\n\nWrt the brewing issues that don't have to deal with you being locked out, I feel like you should move or talk to them/the landlord to work something out. Changing the wifi password is petty, won't resolve any issues, and will just make them more hostile if you were to need their help later.", "YTA in general. If you don't want to share the wifi you're solely paying for or the kitchenware you bought on your own, fine, but you need to get over your issues with them.\n\nYou're being spiteful over something that you admit was your fault. They're not there to be your friend, they're there because three people splitting rent is cheaper than living alone.\n\nIf you want to spend the money to make the place more livable and they don't, that's on you. They don't have to spend money on things they clearly don't care about.", "YWBTA for two reasons: \n1) punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime, especially considering there wasn\u2019t a crime since they weren\u2019t obligated to Uber back for you while they were busy;\n2) I think there\u2019s just bad communication here, and that response isn\u2019t going to help the situation at all, speaking as someone who has had terrible roommates and wanted to be petty. \n\nI recommend just sitting down and talking together to come up with rules and plans for all of this stuff.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't think locking yourself out and expecting them to skip class is reasonable. I've sat in the NY winter before because I forgot my key. You were inside lol. They are  assholes  because they should contribute to the house as I said", "YTA. You are 27 years old and blaming others for you locking yourself out? This sounds like a stressful situation but JFC take some responsibility. Punishing your roommates by withholding a utility is absurd. It would be one thing if you asked them to chip in for it, but if you\u2019re not going to allow them access because of this then you\u2019re ridiculous and will have a terrible time living together.", "YWBTA if you stop sharing kitchenware. With the WiFi they really should pitch in with the cost. I doubt they would pay for it though, seems like they want to make a point about something."]}
