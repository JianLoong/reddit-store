We\u2019ve been doing that for as long as i can remember.       \n\nThis all started 3 years ago when my kids and i came back from my family\u2019s, my husband insisted he had a surprise for me and that i would absolutely love it. Once i entered our living room, i discovered he had painted the walls a hideous shade of pink, almost peach but still mildly striking. I hated it.\n\nFor context we own a house far away from the city centre to which we go to during weekend and in which i gave him full liberty to do his arts and crafts considering how much he loves doing these things, the appartement i came back to tho, is closer to our jobs and the children\u2019s schools so we stay there during the week. I acted as if i liked the change and that it\u2019s refreshing to the living room that i had previously decorated in muted and monochromatic colours, but that these kinds of decisions should\u2019ve been discussed prior. He agreed and we moved on. \n\nThe next year however, while driving back home from my parents, my husband called and informed me that he had yet another surprise for the kids and i and that it involved our balcony. I loved our balcony it was my safe place, i kept plants in there and spent all of my alone time in it and so i was irritated at the thought of it changing without my knowledge. My husband decided to remove the demi-wall i hung my plants on and replaced it with a green metal grid and put plexiglass on the top area so the balcony was completely closed now. He also disposed of all my plants that ive grown particularly fond of. \n\nI was livid to say the least but kept it together in front of the kids and just went to bed since i was already tired. I figured i could just get new plants and not make a big deal out of the situation since ly husband seemed happy about it. The next morning at breakfast a silly argument started between us and my husband started stating all the things i do that he hates and so i blew up and told him every single ^refrechement^ he\u2019d done is hideous to me and that he has no taste in home d\u00e9cor and should stop believing he does, he got mad, stormed off, and is now giving me the silent treatment .

WTF? He threw away living things you maintain.", "NTA. Why is nobody commenting on how malicious and controlling the husband's behavior is? He purposely destroyed her decorating in the living room and then threw out all her plants and closed in her favorite place in the house. He's trashing everything she likes.\n\nThe husband is purposely doing this and then when OP objected he had a list of complaints about her just ready to go.", "your husband threw your plants out?!?!??? NTA. What a git.", "NTA.   \nPainting is one thing, it can be painted over.  \nYour husband definitely shouldn't have thrown away your plants. If he knows the balcony is your space then yeah he should've talked to you before he did anything. He should've talked to you about changes before he tried to do any.    \nThe house is owned by both of you so I do believe a discussion should've happened before he did anything.", "Nta. Your husband's taste is irrelevant. It's both your home and those choices are a joint one.

His tastes may just be different than yours.\n\nHe's TA for fricking throwing out your plants! Who does that? I'm sure you thought you made it clear that these kinds of decisions need to be discussed ahead of time, but apparently not. Yall need to calmly discuss this and he should be repurchasing your plants and perhaps even replacing your demi-wall", "Info:  has he ever complained about you guys leaving?  Maybe a malicious way to keep you home?", "NTA, but when things calm down, have a civil discussion about it.", "I would take his car that he drives to the office and have it spray painted Barbie Pink and have pink fur lining on the car interiors. Also install an extremely loud and embarrassing ringtone on his phone. Replace all the office shirts with Frilly neon colored shirts etc. And that would just be the beginning of my comeback.", "ESH\n\nBy pretending the first remake didn't bother you, you set up a situation that later led to you releasing all the pent up feelings in a way that wasn't constructive.\n\nYour husband is changing things after agreeing that redecoration decisions should be mutual, and he got rid of plants that he knows you put time into caring for.\n\nThis is not about redecorating. It is about two people who communicate with passive aggressive messaging because they haven't learned how to share their feelings. Things build up until something blows up. Get a therapist.

More you than him.\n\nHe sounds clueless, not malicious. Definitely should not have re-done the balcony without discussing it first, since you made it quite clear after the pink paint that you didn't appreciate his 'surprises.'\n\nBut you personally attacked him, with cruel words chosen specifically to hurt.
