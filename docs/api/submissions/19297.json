There's a showtime show called couples therapy that's a great rep of what actual sessions look like. \n\nHe's an asshole for just throwing away your plants. Does he have any idea what a collection costs? \n\nHome decorating should always be a joint project. If he wants to do more or have more say around the house, he needs to say something, he can't just unilaterally decide things any more than you should be.

Living plants are a little more than decoration.

How's he supposed to know if you pretend", "YTA. You mention this started 3 years ago, the only thing you said was \"we should talk about major changes\". That's not remotely good communication. Then, when he made another change you didn't like, you blew up at him and said things that I assume you know are intentionally hurtful. You know he likes to do art projects, so telling him he has no taste is just rude and hurtful. Honestly I'm shocked he threw your plants away, but you went to bed without saying anything?!!? Maybe ESH, but your communication is top tier bad.", "ESH. On multiple occasions your husband has made significant changes that you can't stand, but you didn't tell him that they bothered you. You weren't even going to tell him how you felt about the plants! It's no wonder you blew up at him when the opportunity arose - you are rightfully pissed off.  \n\nYour husband is absolutely in the wrong for doing what he did.

You can't expect your husband to take your feelings into account if you don't tell him what they are.", "Yikes. \n\nYou were a fucking 10 on him painting the room pink.

He gets TA for throwing away all the plants, because who throws away other people\u2019s plants?", "She's still the AH for blowing up at him and telling him everything he does is hideous. The fact that she wasn't honest with him about her thoughts on the changes only makes her more of an AH. She didn't even confront him about the plants, her communication is atrocious.", "You are wrong", "Does he not want her to go and this is his way of punishing her?", "OP to husband:\n\n\"I love you. And ever since you repainted the living room I realize you love punk so much and I never knew! I dyed all your white shirts and sweaters Pink while you were at the pub.\",", "OP to husband:\n\n\"I love you. And ever since you repainted the living room I realize you love punk so much and I never knew! I dyed all your white shirts and sweaters Pink while you were at the pub.\",", "This is the house they spend <2 days out of the week at, and which is explicitly his for arts and crafts.\n\nOP is the asshole here, absolutely.", "OP to husband:\n\n\"I love you. And ever since you repainted the living room I realize you love punk so much and I never knew! I dyed all your white shirts and sweaters Pink while you were at the pub.\",", "Could also be acting out as he feels their home doesn't reflect his ideas, and is disguising the things he wants to do to put his mark down as \"help\"", "But she established after the first time that these should be mutually agreed upon decisions.   Just because she didn't have a melt down doesn't mean that she didn't address it.", "She has to take care of their kids *and* manage his free time. She might as well bring him along if he needs his hand held so badly.", "I have had absolute break downs because the changes were supposed to upset me. The few time they were nice but unsettling because I hate surprises the X-husband was Slightly irritated when they didn't hurt me enough.", "Ding, ding, ding! On target with that observation.", "Yes! I would not be ok with my husband redecorating without us talking about it first. That just seems a little controlling or something.", "If my husband threw away my plants he'd better sleep with one eye open.", "Holy shit, the amount of arguments and logical reasoning included in this comment!", "It reads that way doesn\u2019t it?", "That's exactly what I was thinking.", "Sounds more like passive aggressive punishment for all the things he doesn\u2019t like that she does, but keeps bottled up inside.", "This. This is exactly it. I once went for lunch with a friend and when I got home my alcoholic ex had tried to wallpaper the entire place. Then one time I was in hospital for a week with a throat problem, came home and she'd done something similar. This is definitely a 'this is what you get when you leave me alone' type of relationship.", "No it\u2019s not. This is at their daily apartment. OP was saying that he has a place to redecorate to his hearts content but he chose to fuck with her plants instead.", "She casually mentioned, 3 years ago now, that they should discuss major changes. She never discusses her feelings on the paint, or the plants.", "Skipping all the renovation nonsense, it sounds like some non-relevant argument started at breakfast and they both unloaded things they'd kept in.  There seems to be an underlying issue and the renovations and disagreement is only a surface sympton.", "Are we reading the same story? OP doesn't address any of her concerns with her partner. She lies about the reasons she doesn't want him to make changes, and doesn't address issues when they come up. She built up 3 years of resentment and then blew up at him telling him his artistic taste is bad.", "When \" I'm alone\" I start cleaning,  taking the trash out, dishes and laundry.... Maybe I'm just weird, but the first thing I see is something that needs cleaning.", "She should tell her partner not to throw away her things? I've never had to tell my husband not to throw away my book collection because he's not crazy. I can turn a blind eye to paint but you don't throw away your partner's belongings.", "She blew up at him *after* he started rattling off things he hates about her", "She lies and said it was fine but did ask him to communicate before making these changes. So it's not like she said \"great\". She said said \"great... But don't do this again\" and he did!"]}
