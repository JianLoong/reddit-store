There's a showtime show called couples therapy that's a great rep of what actual sessions look like. \n\nHe's an asshole for just throwing away your plants.

If he wants to do more or have more say around the house, he needs to say something, he can't just unilaterally decide things any more than you should be.

How's he supposed to know if you pretend", "YTA. You mention this started 3 years ago, the only thing you said was \"we should talk about major changes\". That's not remotely good communication. Then, when he made another change you didn't like, you blew up at him and said things that I assume you know are intentionally hurtful. You know he likes to do art projects, so telling him he has no taste is just rude and hurtful. Honestly I'm shocked he threw your plants away, but you went to bed without saying anything?!!? Maybe ESH, but your communication is top tier bad.", "ESH. On multiple occasions your husband has made significant changes that you can't stand, but you didn't tell him that they bothered you. You weren't even going to tell him how you felt about the plants! It's no wonder you blew up at him when the opportunity arose - you are rightfully pissed off.  \n\nYour husband is absolutely in the wrong for doing what he did.

You can't expect your husband to take your feelings into account if you don't tell him what they are.", "Yikes. \n\nYou were a fucking 10 on him painting the room pink.
