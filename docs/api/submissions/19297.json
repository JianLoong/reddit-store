There's a showtime show called couples therapy that's a great rep of what actual sessions look like. \n\nHe's an asshole for just throwing away your plants.

If he wants to do more or have more say around the house, he needs to say something, he can't just unilaterally decide things any more than you should be.

How's he supposed to know if you pretend", "YTA. You mention this started 3 years ago, the only thing you said was \"we should talk about major changes\". That's not remotely good communication. Then, when he made another change you didn't like, you blew up at him and said things that I assume you know are intentionally hurtful. You know he likes to do art projects, so telling him he has no taste is just rude and hurtful. Honestly I'm shocked he threw your plants away, but you went to bed without saying anything?!!? Maybe ESH, but your communication is top tier bad.", "ESH. On multiple occasions your husband has made significant changes that you can't stand, but you didn't tell him that they bothered you. You weren't even going to tell him how you felt about the plants! It's no wonder you blew up at him when the opportunity arose - you are rightfully pissed off.  \n\nYour husband is absolutely in the wrong for doing what he did.

You can't expect your husband to take your feelings into account if you don't tell him what they are.", "Yikes. \n\nYou were a fucking 10 on him painting the room pink.

Throwing away your wife\u2019s belongings because she visited her family isn\u2019t some sort of coincidence. He\u2019s just masking these things to be in her favor so as to not take responsibility for his resentment and people are eating it up.", "Yes, she should have been a nice wife and succumbed to his wishes after he threw away her belongings on purpose /s", "Controlling behavior, throwing people\u2019s belongings in the trash and dismissing their feelings isn\u2019t kindness.", "Right?

My housemate loves plants so much, and we have a ton for what little space we have. But I\u2019d never throw them out!!

I take them out of the window for winter and they were next to the heater.... That wasn't enough to save them, I was so upset, so I couldn't imagine someone just chucking my plants out.

This right here is why I stopped getting married!", "It's one or the other but he needs to use his words.", "I think it's the apartment.  She says the living room *she* decorated in monochrome, the balcony that's *her* safe space.  I agree that paint colours should be agreed on, and that he had no right to throw het plants out, but she also says she *lets him* do what he wants at the other weekend residence.   It's the *lets him* that makes me think she doesn't *let him* do anything at the apartment, and so he waits til she's gone and can't stop him, to assert himself.   \n\nESH because these two either need to learn to communicate better, or he should move to the house and be as creative as he wants to be and make it his safe place, and she can do the same at the apartment", "Yikes\u2026 glad he\u2019s an ex! No one deserves major changes like that to be surprises (unless they were already previously discussed and it was a matter of timing).

If the first thing he does after she comes back is insult her I don't really blame her reaction and would probably say NTA. I somehow thought she'd bottled it up for a long time, which could give him the impression it was okay (even though it obviously isn't)\n\nDefinitely makes it sound like he threw away the plants to be deliberately hurtful. Even if she gets the same kind of plants to replace them it's awful losing something you poured time and care into, my housemate has plants and loves them so much, I can't imagine throwing them away and pretending it was a nice surprise for her.", "So does she. The \"keep it together in front of the kids\" thing is unhealthy imo. It's fine for children to see parents have a civil disagreement. What would be so bad about saying, \"Where are my plants?

I've never had to tell my husband not to throw away my book collection because he's not crazy.\n\nExactly. If one spouse threw out another's Playstation in the name of redecorating, people would be losing their fucking minds. Throwing away a plant is not just throwing away a decoration; it is throwing away all of the time and energy the person spent getting them to grow. Anyone who thinks it's \"just plants\" needs to go wipe all their game save files and see how they feel about losing hours and hours of effort.", "Everyone here seems really focused on the plants, which I agree is wrong.

Absolutely he needs to communicate, they both have obvious problems in that department, but specifically, it's not greedy to want to live in a home and have it reflect the fact that you live there, which was the argument you were making before deflecting the point.", "Well she did state that she didn't want to argue in front of the kids, so ended up going to bed that night. And sometimes you just hope for the best from your partner. You don't want to be mad at them for what your partner might just have considered an accident by the end of the discussion, especially after they've completed a project that they're proud of. Then they got into an argument that turned into him insulting her. The straw that broke the camel's back as they say. My husband and I have vastly different styles, he's purchased furniture that in no way compliments anything we own, let alone the house (think brutalist style meets Tony Stark penthouse), but I grin and bare it and try to find a way to incorporate it into the house because he made a decision to express himself creatively that I'm not about to squash, but if he completely tore down a space that a lot of thought went into without discussing it, and then insulted the space he'd just torn down, that'd be the straw.", "*after* he\u2019d let her know everything he hates about her.

He doesn't care about her joy or things that bring her it.", "I agree with you. The first time was a shock. Then it slowly became a pattern. She definitely had the right to lose it with him when he listed everything he dislikes about her. If I were her I would consider counseling or a separation.
