Good lord.\n\nYour wife's initial concern was justified, but after the situation was explained and an apology was offered, she should have dropped it. There was no reason to call 911, or even store security. You didn't \"fail as a husband,\" you were acting rationally.", "NTA\n\nIt was fine for your wife to yell for help and get upset when it first happened.  \n\nCalling 911 and continuing to make a huge deal of it after the son explained the dementia was out of line and definitely a huge overreaction.", "NTA\n\nWhile your wife _does_ have a point- idk how old your kid is but that's a little traumatic to have some strange woman come grab you. It's scary for a little kid.\n\nThe son should be a little more careful with his mom. What if she grabbed a kid with special needs and the kid hurt her or themself? I do think though he apologized, explained the situation and nothing else bad happened. Calling 911 was too far. \n\nI think if your wife felt strongly about reporting it- tell the store manager. That's it.", "NTA. Your wife's initial panic is understandable, but doubling down and calling the police when it was already clear the woman wasn't a threat and the moment was over was extreme and unnecessary.", "NTA\n\nPanicking i can understand. Calling 911 when the situation has already been defused\\* and there was no danger to the kid? That's an asshole move. 911 is an **emergency line**, There was no emergency. Also, if you are in America, is she trying to get someone killed? There is absolutely no world where I would take your wife's side after she involved the police for such a shit reason.\n\nI hope in the future once her health starts failing she'd be fine with her children just dumping her in a home where she belongs (as per her claims). She shows an extreme lack of empathy. Also how did she leave a 1.5yo in such a situation where a helpless old granny was able to take him and hug him without her being able to put a stop to it before it even happened?", "NTA. Get your wife a therapist. That's a way overboard reaction.", "NTA.

It was her daughter to apologise. Her mother was visiting for the holidays but usually resided in a care home as she had dementia. I felt bad for her. A few days later when the older lady returned to my door with the same complaints I apologised to her and promised to keep my dog and kid better controlled. Funny but it seemed to appease her.", "NTA. You wife's initial reaction is over the board but at least understandable. Her follow up reaction though is completely nuts.

Had my wife reacted like that after the situation was explained to her I would have been SO ashamed of her.", "Nah, I am torn, for unfortunately I feel like the women behavior was excused. That its gonna be continued to be excused until something worse happens.

Wife\u2019s initial reaction was understandable (I won\u2019t say justified because how dangerous is a bug from an 87-year old woman) because a stranger touching your young child is disconcerting. But to yell at the woman\u2019s son after he apologized and explained the dementia and THEN to call 911\u2026there was no emergency and that was an abuse of emergency services. Your wife needs to get a grip on reality and some compassion for the elderly.", "NTA, I can see why she reacted at first but once being told the woman had dementia she should have let it go. Calling the police is a massive overreaction and put that family through unnecessary stress, especially when police have a reputation of not always handling these situations great.", "NAH\n\nI see why your wife was scared. A random stranger touched her child, didn\u2019t even ask her permission, just grabbed her baby! And with child nappers, they can be any age, any gender. She had 0 idea who that woman was, why she was touching her child or what she was planning on doing. A hug seems innocent but consider it envelopes the child  into someone\u2019s arms, which can then be used to pick them up, an infant wouldn\u2019t be able to escape. \n\nYou\u2019re not wrong for feeling bad and not supporting calling the cops once the situation was explained. Your wife isn\u2019t wrong however either, she likely still was very terrified and acted to protect her baby.", "I'm torn bc in my area they use women to approach children in order to abduct them. Bc women aren't viewed as threatening. I personally don't like to go grocery shopping without my husband when i have the kids for this reason. I do think she was in a major panic and reacted that way bc once you feel your child is being threatened it's hard to come down from that.  I don't think you're the asshole but I can see why your wife reacted that way. I'd say the first bump was a bit much and probably made your wife feel like her feelings didn't matter as much to you as placating some stranger", "NAH.

I don\u2019t trust them to have good intentions, don\u2019t trust them to keep others safety in mind, don\u2019t trust them to group up and stop something bad that\u2019s happening. So I tend to get sketched out by people. But I will say there have been so many fuxking times I as a woman have been followed by men and harassed. Often. How do I know they\u2019re following Me? Taking four lefts or four rights. It happens more often than not. Even around my block at home. It\u2019s terrible I feel like a fuxking prisoner in my home these days. Why? Because people are fucking weird.", "ESH, I actually agree with your wife, if she does not have the mental capacity to not hug random strangers' kid's she shouldn't be out in public.\n\nMedical condition or not it's unacceptable behaviour, but actually calling the police is an overreaction.\n\nEdit: not only is it unacceptable, it's also dangerous for her, your wife merely called the cops, other people could have far worse reactions.", "NAH, but only marginally for your wife, I am worried about her. I understand her fears. Parents should exercise caution,but when you ramp it up to level, it tends to make everyone over anxious and scared. I can get firmly rebuking the lady. The son needs to think about keeping a closer watch, for his mom's safety too.  But your wife made an uncomfortable situation worse.", "Why is your wife so paranoid that your child will be kidnapped? You are NTA. Wife maybe needs some counselling to help her deal with her anxiety issues.", "NTA - I get your son is 19 months but Jesus that was an overreaction. Granted the lady shouldn\u2019t have touched him but once the son came over and explained you both should\u2019ve told him to keep a better eye on her and left. Calling the police is mad IMO, no wonder everyone was looking at her funny. Is this your first child? Maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s being overprotective. Still she needs to calm herself down before she makes herself sick with worry.", "NTA\n\nHer initial reaction is parental instinct.\n\nBut it sounds like she escalated more and more even as the situation was totally de-escalating.\n\nCompassionately, though, you might want to talk to her about what was going on when everyone is calm again.

Her son needs to keep a better eye on her, though, when they are out so that she doesn't get hurt or caught up in another situation like this.", "NTA. Wife needs therapy. I refuse to teach our kids stranger danger, because there are times in life we need help from strangers. Instead we teach safe strangers vs possibly unsafe strangers. Obviously we don't leave them to fend for themselves in public at young ages or anything. We set the example of who we ask for help in a store, who we ask directions from, etc. If your wife can't discern who is actually a potential threat or not, how is she ever going to teach your child? It's 100% ok to tell someone not to touch your child, so child learns boundaries are important. It's 100% not ok to call 911 when child was fine, you were present, son explained dementia situation.", "Anyone else remember that story of that woman almost taking a redditors child in a Walmart parking lot saying she's the Mom and everyone immediately held him down and if his wife didn't come out at that moment they would have lost their infant child? And then the police tried to convince them to drop charges because the woman might have been 'confused' and 'wanted to help' when she took their child and screamed bloody murder he was trying to kidnap 'her' child? \n\nNo?\n\nJust me? \n\nOkay. \n\nYTA", "NAH maybe calling the police is a bit overreacting but this woman\u2019s just grabbed her child of course she\u2019s going to panic. Old ladies can still be bad people or can be part of groups that use them to take children. All she knows is this random woman has just grabbed her kid. If she\u2019s know to randomly pick up children she needs to be supervised in public places. What the police did is wildly unprofessional.", "NTA.\n\nThe elderly woman's son was there and he tried to diffuse the situation. Its not her fault, she's ill. Your wife didn't need to go to the extreme.", "Your wife was ridiculous the moment she called the police and proceeded to berate the elderly woman's son for not putting her in a home, some people can't afford a home to put them in and some don't want to shove there family into a home alone.", "It\u2019s not a situation to call the cops over but a random woman embracing your young child without consent is still repulsive and unacceptable. It\u2019s not your or your wife\u2019s problem if she has mental issues.", "NAH. Look, your wife overreacted by calling 911 and because of that the situation escalated. But if you wouldnt have been so dismissive of her maybe you could have calm her down and make her feel safe. \n\nThis woman's son needs to try better. Patients with dementia can hurt themselves or others when confused or stressed, even if they're normally harmless . He shouldn't have left her alone, even for a split of a second, just like you wouldnt leave your kid alone at the mall. \n\nYour kid is still a toddler, so I can understand how scary the situation was for her.", "YTA, your wife is protecting her child. That should be a higher priority for you than some random old lady. Old ladies are capable of harming young children, especially when in an altered mental state. The son should have kept a better eye on his mom, or left her at home.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d have said N A H if your wife hadn\u2019t called the police. That was an overreaction, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something in her past or that she\u2019s seen in the media/online/somewhere that triggered it. \n\nI think my initial reaction would have been similar. But calling security and the cops? I can\u2019t rationalise that in my head. Especially after the woman\u2019s son explained and apologised.", "NTA\n\nWhere was your wife when this woman got close enough to your son to hug him?? I grocery shop with my toddler but am never far enough away from her that I can't body block people from getting too close.

Your wife was justified in freaking out. It's scary when a stranger touches your child for whatever reason. I do think she overreacted in calling 911. The fact that the son and mom didn't try to get away tells me he was likely telling the truth about her. Assuming you're in the US, I'm going to guess that the son can't afford decent care for his mom. Sad.", "Yta- she is right. If the woman can\u2019t be trusted  alone and has that level of dementia she shouldn\u2019t be left to potentially hurt kids. What if the kid struggled, broken arm? Hugged to tight can\u2019t breathe? She should have called the police as her son needs a bloody good wake up call.  What\u2019s next, wondering off with a child to go to the park?  Wake up ! you got lucky this time.", "ESH. You should have had your wife\u2019s back, she was right to be upset initially. That guy should lock his mom up if she can\u2019t keep her hands to herself, especially post-Covid. You do not touch other people without permission, period. I\u2019d have absolutely lost my shit on that guy too, and on you for not having my back in public. Your wife sucks for calling the police, what a narc!", "NTA.  She obviously overreacted a lot (I'm assuming your kid isn't a newborn or immunocompromised or something.)  It's possible your fist bump was a little much and apologizing for her is also maybe a bit much.  She is wrong, but she's still your wife.  Don't embarrass her in public, but definitely let her know how you feel in private.", "YTA. This elderly woman clearly needs better care than her son not taking her mental state seriously. Idk if he cant afford better care or if he doesn't care/thinks its not a big deal but touching strangers is fucked up, especially children, even if she didn't mean it in a harmful way. You and Her son don't seem to take this woman's condition seriously and its sad to see. \nIt is a fully understandable reaction that your wive wanted a potentially dangerous person (yes, even if they don't mean it people with that litte lucidity are a danger to themselves and others) to be properly taken care of.

Like, they convince themselves they NEED guns so the world MUST be a horrible place?", ">Why weren\u2019t you focused on your wife?\n\nWell I think the obvious answer is how you assess danger. When you first look at scene and you see your wife screaming and looking at your child who has someone near them. The first step is a) make sure the child is away from the stranger then b) double check to make sure the wife is not injured c) figure out what is going on. The son was probably near by was already trying to deal with his mother so it would make sense to just ask what the hell is going on. Rather than ignoring everything focusing on your wife and making sure she is calm (dont get me wrong that is important but figuring out what is going on so you can figure out what action to take is more important). It takes longer than 15 seconds to look at a situation and figure out what is going on. So whilst he is having the conversation with the son the wife was probably calling 911 and doing all that fun stuff. Whilst I understand everyone wants their husband to be superman who can perfectly handle every single situation men are just people too and everyone will react differently. Like I explained how I think a rational person should act but that is filtered through my own view point and perspective. Everyone will have a slightly different game plan. But just because he went to find out what was going on does not mean he was not worried. I do think he is wrong for not trying to calm her down after he realized what is going on but I mean he most likely did (I doubt he just made small talk for 25 min) but just didnt think to include it cause doesnt really add to the story.\n\nAnd well I would apologize to the cops as well. Because whilst she was justified in her initial reaction I dont think she was justified escalating it for no apparent reason.

At that point she had massively overreacted and now he was dealing with the that. You say she overreacts but in the same paragraph act like it\u2019s not her fault for the overreaction as he talks to the police. She WAS acting with no reason, to call 9-1-1 after hearing the explanation is asinine and a waste of police resources because they 100% aren\u2019t doing anything and probably didn\u2019t even file a report.\n\nIt\u2019s weird that you think because he wasn\u2019t consoling his wife who was completely blowing the whole situation overboard that means he\u2019s being a bad husband to her.
