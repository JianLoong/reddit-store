We're not at each other's throats or anything, but she just seems to be slacking off sometimes. I've tried to help her out a bit and talk to her, but she never wanted to hear it. SIL recently got a new entry level job that she'll be relocating for.\n\nWe celebrated Thanksgiving with my husband's (29M) family this year, and it was a massive get together. A lot of people congratulated SIL on her new job, which is understandable. However, my in-laws were acting like they'd won a billion dollars.\n\nSome relatives kept asking about SIL's new job, when she'll be moving etc. I tried to change the topic, but my SIL got kind of pissed and said something like \"You don't have to be a part of this conversation\". I replied that we're all proud of her, maybe people want to talk about other things sometimes too. SIL again, got very snarky and said \"Again, leave the conversation\". \n\nI'll admit I got annoyed at that point and said \"Coming from the woman who's milking compliments for something most people achieve by the age of 16\". \n\nMy SIL got really mad and said I have no position saying that. There were a few people around that started going off at me. I eventually walked off and told my husband I was leaving. He didn't know what was going on at that point, but in the heat of the moment I just took the car and left. A cousin ended up dropping him off at home.\n\nMy SIL is obviously pissed at me and my husband heard the whole thing, he said I created a scene for no reason and should apologize to SIL (even though people started going off at me). I shared this with my mom and she said I wasn't wrong and people are coddling SIL. \n\nI get that I might've overreacted a bit but I think it was justified. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669555034, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z610ep/aita_for_leaving_thanksgiving_dinner_after_my_sil/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not always about you. Go and apologise.", "YTA: you could have left your sister in law alone. If this was, indeed, a \"massive\"gathering, surely there were other people to talk to. You sound like you were upset someone else was getting attention.", "Wow YTA and your SIL was right! Clearly people actually wanted to talk about this subject and you were the ONLY one that had a problem with it.", "YTA. This is her family and they are proud of her! It\u2019s probably best you left since you sound so jealous and self-centered in this exchange. I\u2019m glad SIL stood up for herself and that your husband had the sense to realize that you were far enough in the wrong to earn leaving alone.", "YTA- She was excited about a new job and moving and her family was excited for her. You just decided that it wasn\u2019t good enough to be excited over, but that isn\u2019t really for you to decide. If you were uncomfortable about the conversation, you should have just left it. Leaving the whole event is petty and rude, especially to your husband.", "YTA\n\nYou tried to change the topic for the entire table because you didn\u2019t feel like engaging in the conversation. \n\nIf there were other people also annoyed by the topic, start a side conversation with them (although I feel like you would have mentioned if that was the case. From what you presented, you were the only one)\n\nYou were snide and snobby. I don\u2019t know your SIL circumstances but I don\u2019t need to. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s \u201centry level\u201d, the family was excited for her but you had to make it all about yourself. And based on SIL reaction I doubt this was the first time you tried to take light away from her so you could shine instead.", "YTA. Just another case of not minding your own business.", "YTA - you didn\u2019t read the room, or you ignored it. It\u2019s bad form to interject into a conversation with an attempt to steer away from the topic (unless it\u2019s something that people are getting heated over and it\u2019s an attempt to diffuse).", "YTA, you sound jealous.  Go apologize if she'll listen.", "YTA. The snarky one was you, not you SIL. You come across as petty, jealous, insecure, and immature. In a \u201cmassive get together\u201d you somehow weaseled yourself into your SIL\u2019s conversations. She was correct in telling you to butt out.", "YTA. You're jealous of her.", "YTA obviously.

I'm not sure why, but I would recommend unpacking that with a therapist", "YTA - Why are you so pressed that your SIL's family care about her enough to congratulate her on a new job? She was correct...you could have left and found another conversation at any time. From where I'm standing, It's you. You're the problem. You had to cut her down a notch for no other reason than jealousy over family showing interest in her.", "What do they say, \u201cqueens fix each others crown?\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not your business when they stop celebrating her accomplishment. You showed pettiness at the dinner.\n\nYTA", "Yta. The actions you displayed sound petty and childish and even a bit jealous. Your husband wasnt there for it meant there were other things going on at the time so you didnt have to be in that conversation and to try and change it was rude. Being snarky and dismissive of her achievements was also rude. Leaving your husband stranded because other people started telling you you were wrong was ultra rude. You owe that girl an apology and everyone else that was there.", "YTA not your house. You don't decide on the conversation. Sounds like somebody was a little jealous of the attention she was getting.", "YTA and sound jealous.", "YTA. You started all of it. It\u2019s completely rude to try to change the subject like you did when her own family is trying to ask her about her new job. You were being the mean girl, and thus got treated like one.", "YTA. Wow, do you sound jealous and petty.", "YTA Most people learn their manners when they're children but you seem to be delayed on that. Mocking your SIL for getting a job later in life when you can't even let people have a conversation without interrupting like a toddler...\n\nHer family is excited for her and wanted to talk about her new job. You didn't need to interject yourself into it. Just stay out of it if you don't want to talk about it.", "YTA and just mean. Sucks for your husband you driving a wedge between him and his family.", "Your husband is right. You sound very condescending toward your sil and upset that she was getting praise, and you owe sil an apology. YTA", "YTA.

Judging the reactions you describe, obviously not. ANd you got called out bay many for your assholery. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you threw a tantrum and left.

You're most definitely the AH.", "Girl bye. Your a literal kid. YTA", "What do you mean, \u201ceven though\u201d people started going off on you? Is that a reason to not say sorry to your SIL? Were you answering for SIL when she was standing right next to you? You clearly walked off because you were embarrassed by your statements. Did you really expect Reddit to respond any differently?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have something nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all. YTA.", "YTA . You too jealous to keep your mouth shut. You are immature for involving yourself in someone's conversation and then demanding they change the subject for you.", "YTA. Why were you so upset about this? Does she not deserve to be celebrated for her accomplishments, even if they\u2019re small compared to some standard you\u2019ve got in your head?", "YTA 100%. You said a ridiculously cruel thing to someone for no reason. Most people would be supportive of someone who is clearly struggling but is taking a positive step in the right direction. You for some reason chose this moment to make someone feel awful because\u2026 you were annoyed?", "YTA. Are you a child?", "YTA 100%. \u201cShe just seems to be slacking off sometimes\u201d? \u201cI\u2019ve tried to help her out\u201d? How arrogant are you to think you can judge other people\u2019s lives? I have to imagine everyone in that room breathed a sigh of relief when you left.", "Yep, YTA.", "Yta so you interrupted someone else's conversation,  and got told off? That also is something people learn at 16.", "YTA. You let past dynamics getting into that particular moment. She was expressing an achievement, everyone was congratulating her, you judged her and downgraded her. You could just have gone to the toilet and excuse yourself.", "YTA, and honestly sound like you're jealous that people were talking about someone other than you. \n\nIt sounds like the other guests kept asking her questions because they were interested. You do not get to dictate what other people are allowed to talk about (other than perhaps banning broad topics like politics or medical issues from the dinner table, if they are likely to be unappetizing or cause arguments). \n\nSIL tried to clue you in to this fact, but apparently you were just out for a fight.", "Wow.  Jealous much?  YTA.  Your SIL got a new job and her family is interested in hearing about it.", "YTA. You were jealous because you weren\u2019t the center of attention and believe you are justified in taking attention away from someone else.", "YTA so her family isn't allowed to ask her about her new job? I mean if you didn't want to talk about it as your sil said... why didn't you just leave the conversation?", "YTA and that's from us just hearing your side of it. People wanted to talk about her new job. Your SIL is right, if you didn't want to be part of the conversation you didn't have to be but it was rude to keep trying to change the subject. You didn't like that so yoy were incredibly rude and insulting to her and it was clear you were in the wrong as the other people there all thought so too.\n\nWhy do you think you were justified in stopping people talk about her new job and insulting it and her? You thinking it's not a very good job is no excuse for your behaviour and your husband is right that you created the scene.", "Are you always this insufferable? \n\n>me relatives kept asking about SIL's new job, when she'll be moving etc. I tried to change the topic, but my SIL got kind of pissed and said something like \"You don't have to be a part of this conversation\". I replied that we're all proud of her, maybe people want to talk about other things sometimes too.

That apple landed right next to the tree it seems. \n\nYta and better be embarrassed about how you acted.", "If you'd accomplish something, you'd get attention too. Let her enjoy her accomplishment. YTA, sorry...", "YTA. Her family was proud of her. If you didn\u2019t want to hear it you could\u2019ve walked away.

Let her have her 'all about me' day, because it literally costs you nothing. By doing this you soured a lot of people at that event against you, so it was lose/lose for you.", "YTA\n\nIf your mother is telling you that you\u2019re in the right here, you\u2019re the one being coddled.", "YTA Your sister deserved to be celebrated as anyone should. You should have let her have her moment. You sound pretty dismissive of your sister.", "You need to apologise to not only your SIL but your husband aswell. You literally abandoned him, your lucky he wasn\u2019t even a bit angry at you. Some partner you are to just leave him there in an environment where everyone would probably be taking their anger out on him because of YOU", "\n\n\"SIL recently got a new entry level job that she'll be relocating for....\n\n(followed by)\n\n'Coming from the woman who's milking compliments for something most people achieve by the age of 16.'\"\n\nYTA. Since when is relocating for a new job something most people achieve by age 16? Most 16 yo people are still in high school living with their parents. Many keep ties through college at age 22.\n\nIf you did not like the topic of convo, you could have joined any of the other convos  that were surely going on at the \"massive gathering.\" No need to insult your SIL and make a scene.", "YTA, what is wrong with you? You created a petty argument at a family gathering.  Your mother is clueless also if she thinks your actions are justified.  Just apologize to her and your husband for leaving him there and being a general embarrassment.", "YT massive A\u2026 \n\nIf you didn\u2019t already realise, I\u2019m sure everyone was very happy that your jealous ass left!", "Eh, ESH\n\nYou for trying to insert yourself into a conversation. I'm sure there were other people around you could've chatted to.\n\nYour SIL for her holier-than-thou attitude. And you're not exactly wrong either. It does sound like people are showering her with compliments because she managed to get a job. I agree people should be congratulated for a new job, but it is true that it's not something incredible and most 26 year olds have some type of job. \n\nI'm curious though, does she usually get coddled and put on a pedestal by your in laws?", "NTA by any means! She came at you first twisted, and flapping her jibs with attitude. Your retort was spot on! You\u2019re so right, most people gain that  entry level position by 16 when most get their first job. Sounds like she\u2019s been coddled, gotten trophies for participating and entitled enough to have the extended family fawn all over her recent entry level accomplishment. Never apologize cause you did nothing wrong!", "ESH\n\nWhat you said was just as bad as what she said. You could have left without making a big deal of it. She could have stopped dominating the conversation.\n\nYou can prioritize yourself without making it about you.", "Exactly. It was a massive gathering, so why was OP trying to force her way into a conversation that didn't concern her. If she wanted to talk about something else, she could have gone elsewhere. Instead she made a fool out of herself in front of her husband's entire family and people rightfully didn't stand for her rude behaviour.\n\nIf she told her mother a truthful retelling of this story, then her mom is an AH, too.", "> he said I created a scene for no reason and should apologize to SIL (even though people started going off at me).\n\nAnyone else getting that [\"missing missing reasons\"](https://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html) emotional argument vibe?\n\nAs in, it sounds an awful lot like _\"look how bad they made me feel (with their 100% valid criticism)!\"_", " The moment didn\u2019t require you to say anything. If you don\u2019t like the conversation leave the conversation.", "But can't you see, OP wanted to talk about something else and since they're just so special, everyone should pivot to her preferences! Her mommy said so too!", ">It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s \u201centry level\u201d\n\nYeah, even if it's the most basic thing in the world, it's an interesting thing to talk about: where are you moving to, what kind of job is it, that kind of thing. That's what people who care about each other ask and talk about.", "He didn't know at the time, I told him when he came home later and he also heard  from SIL after I left", "I also wanted to add that mature people don't sit around judging others on not being as \"far along\" in life. A family that cares is going to do exactly what your husband's family did. They show interest in your SIL and her new job, not because it's a fascinating achievement, but because it represents progress for her. Not every conversation about someone's job is for the benefit of the question asker. Sometimes we engage in the conversation as a way of showing love and indicating that we're proud of someone for taking a big life step FOR THEM.", "Of course she deserves to be celebrated, I never said she doesn't. But this isn't the only time, there was a farewell dinner for her earlier, gift giving (for her \"new home\"), etc. It's DHS so everyone is going overboard over a job. We're proud of her for sure, but all this has to end at some point.", "I\u2019m sorry, where was the SIL\u2019s \u2018holier-than-thou\u2019 attitude? Her relatives were asking her about her new job and she was answering their questions. If anyone is holier than thou, it\u2019s OP. Starting with \u201c..she just seems to be slacking off sometimes\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve tried to help her out a bit and talk to her\u201d. OP is a year older than SIL so why dies she feel her advice is warranted or needed? And her comment about her achieving something that most people achieve by the age of 16 was nasty and uncalled for. Sounds to me that OP was jealous that SIL was getting attention.", "I thought it was odd too that their family made such a big deal out of an entry level job for someone SIL's age. But maybe SIL suffered from addiction and hasn't worked until now? Or some other sort of personal issues that prevented her from working? OP is definitely not handling it appropriately though.", "Okay yeah maybe I should've just let it be. I just thought maybe we could talk about something else.\n\nAnd not really, but SIL's the youngest of 5 siblings and she does get babied a bit. Everyone's fawning over this and wanting to know more because it's at DHS, so they've gone a bit overboard.", "People were asking the SIL questions and OP kept interrupting to stop them from talking about it. The SIL didn't go at her first.", "How did she come at OP first? People were asking SIL questions about the job, and OP kept insisting on changing the subject. And \"entry level job\" sounds like she's starting in a new field, not working at a drive thru, my dude. OP was nothing but rude here", "No one was even talking to OP. Other people were having a conversation that she was not part of.  OP butted in and tried to change the subject. Incredibly rude behavior.  Even if SIL is being coddled, if people are asking her questions than they are probably interested.", "Thank you for this link. I have never heard of this argument before, but now I have something tangible to explain some of the behavior of my parental units. Thank you so much.", "Yeh, I noticed that also, OP complains about SIL being coddled and runs home to call mommy and get reassured OP is in the right. When mommy wasn't even present. \n\nWho's the coddled one in this story again??", "Not sure why you think it was the time or place to attempt to dim SIL's light. It seems like she's around HER family, you married in and honestly it's no surprise that they took her side. You were insanely rude and prob lowkey jealous. Unpack that.", "Why? Because you're jealous and don't have the emotional maturity to just disengage from a conversation that isn't about you if you're tired of hearing about it? Walking away and not being melodramatic is free. But here you are, doubling down on being an asshole.\n\nYTA.", "Why do you personally get to decide when it ends? And a farewell dinner implies she is moving a significant distance - have you considered that the family just want to spend as much time with her and celebrate her whilst she\u2019s still there? Your behaviour sounds like that of a mean girl who never outgrew high school.", "Bless your heart. \n\nIt's not your SIL's fault that she is well loved and her family will miss her dearly. Sounds like you are just jealous that you didn't get a party and presents. Who are you to dictate how your SIL's family celebrates her wins?", "Lady what is wrong with you? YTA you started an issue when there was no. Get a life and stop the jealousy.", "DHS, as in Department of Homeland Security? I'd be fuckin stoked if that was my new job, entry level or not. Who pissed in your Cheerios?", "Must be a pretty good entry level job if she has a new home, definitely worth celebrating \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 seems like a big chapter in her life not a small one .", "Oh, you are so jealous, how many 16 year olds get to work at the Department of Homeland Security?", "So what?  It doesn't sound like she's so babied that she can't stand on her own two feet and get a good job.  She's not whining because Daddy won't pay for her mani-pedi.", "If they wanted to talk about something else, they would have. They were clearly actively asking SIL about the move so that is what they wanted to talk about. \n\nAlso, being loved, celebrated and having your family show a keen interest in your life is not being babied. That sounds like a loving, supportive family, to me.", "For sure! Mommy just takes OP's side because she heard this same biased retelling or because she shares her daughter's petty feelings toward her inlaws. She thinks her babygirl is special and doesn't want SIL to get too excited about anything unless OP thinks she should.\n\nMy mom would totally be on my side of any conflict whatsoever, even if I was nasty, petty and inappropriate. She'd tell me they all had it coming and my husband should be served divorce papers for daring disagree. I don't take advice from her because she's not a reliable judge of what is or is not right. OP should watch out for her mom... she doesn't have objective sense.", "Pretty sure OP is going to cling to mom because \"My mom understands.\""]}
