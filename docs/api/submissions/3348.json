We're not at each other's throats or anything, but she just seems to be slacking off sometimes. I've tried to help her out a bit and talk to her, but she never wanted to hear it. SIL recently got a new entry level job that she'll be relocating for.\n\nWe celebrated Thanksgiving with my husband's (29M) family this year, and it was a massive get together. A lot of people congratulated SIL on her new job, which is understandable. However, my in-laws were acting like they'd won a billion dollars.\n\nSome relatives kept asking about SIL's new job, when she'll be moving etc. I tried to change the topic, but my SIL got kind of pissed and said something like \"You don't have to be a part of this conversation\". I replied that we're all proud of her, maybe people want to talk about other things sometimes too. SIL again, got very snarky and said \"Again, leave the conversation\". \n\nI'll admit I got annoyed at that point and said \"Coming from the woman who's milking compliments for something most people achieve by the age of 16\". \n\nMy SIL got really mad and said I have no position saying that. There were a few people around that started going off at me. I eventually walked off and told my husband I was leaving. He didn't know what was going on at that point, but in the heat of the moment I just took the car and left. A cousin ended up dropping him off at home.\n\nMy SIL is obviously pissed at me and my husband heard the whole thing, he said I created a scene for no reason and should apologize to SIL (even though people started going off at me). I shared this with my mom and she said I wasn't wrong and people are coddling SIL. \n\nI get that I might've overreacted a bit but I think it was justified. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669555034, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z610ep/aita_for_leaving_thanksgiving_dinner_after_my_sil/", "score": 6001, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not always about you. Go and apologise.", "YTA: you could have left your sister in law alone. If this was, indeed, a \"massive\"gathering, surely there were other people to talk to. You sound like you were upset someone else was getting attention.", "Wow YTA and your SIL was right! Clearly people actually wanted to talk about this subject and you were the ONLY one that had a problem with it.", "YTA. This is her family and they are proud of her! It\u2019s probably best you left since you sound so jealous and self-centered in this exchange. I\u2019m glad SIL stood up for herself and that your husband had the sense to realize that you were far enough in the wrong to earn leaving alone.", "YTA- She was excited about a new job and moving and her family was excited for her. You just decided that it wasn\u2019t good enough to be excited over, but that isn\u2019t really for you to decide. If you were uncomfortable about the conversation, you should have just left it. Leaving the whole event is petty and rude, especially to your husband.", "YTA\n\nYou tried to change the topic for the entire table because you didn\u2019t feel like engaging in the conversation. \n\nIf there were other people also annoyed by the topic, start a side conversation with them (although I feel like you would have mentioned if that was the case. From what you presented, you were the only one)\n\nYou were snide and snobby. I don\u2019t know your SIL circumstances but I don\u2019t need to. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s \u201centry level\u201d, the family was excited for her but you had to make it all about yourself. And based on SIL reaction I doubt this was the first time you tried to take light away from her so you could shine instead.", "YTA. Just another case of not minding your own business.", "YTA - you didn\u2019t read the room, or you ignored it. It\u2019s bad form to interject into a conversation with an attempt to steer away from the topic (unless it\u2019s something that people are getting heated over and it\u2019s an attempt to diffuse).", "YTA, you sound jealous.  Go apologize if she'll listen.", "YTA. The snarky one was you, not you SIL. You come across as petty, jealous, insecure, and immature. In a \u201cmassive get together\u201d you somehow weaseled yourself into your SIL\u2019s conversations. She was correct in telling you to butt out.", "YTA. You're jealous of her.", "YTA obviously.

She was correct...you could have left and found another conversation at any time. From where I'm standing, It's you. You're the problem. You had to cut her down a notch for no other reason than jealousy over family showing interest in her.", "What do they say, \u201cqueens fix each others crown?\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not your business when they stop celebrating her accomplishment. You showed pettiness at the dinner.\n\nYTA", "Yta. The actions you displayed sound petty and childish and even a bit jealous. Your husband wasnt there for it meant there were other things going on at the time so you didnt have to be in that conversation and to try and change it was rude. Being snarky and dismissive of her achievements was also rude. Leaving your husband stranded because other people started telling you you were wrong was ultra rude. You owe that girl an apology and everyone else that was there.", "YTA not your house. You don't decide on the conversation. Sounds like somebody was a little jealous of the attention she was getting.", "YTA and sound jealous.", "YTA. You started all of it. It\u2019s completely rude to try to change the subject like you did when her own family is trying to ask her about her new job. You were being the mean girl, and thus got treated like one.", "YTA. Wow, do you sound jealous and petty.", "YTA Most people learn their manners when they're children but you seem to be delayed on that. Mocking your SIL for getting a job later in life when you can't even let people have a conversation without interrupting like a toddler...\n\nHer family is excited for her and wanted to talk about her new job. You didn't need to interject yourself into it. Just stay out of it if you don't want to talk about it.", "YTA and just mean.

You sound very condescending toward your sil and upset that she was getting praise, and you owe sil an apology. YTA", "YTA.

Judging the reactions you describe, obviously not. ANd you got called out bay many for your assholery. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you threw a tantrum and left.

You're most definitely the AH.", "Girl bye. Your a literal kid. YTA", "What do you mean, \u201ceven though\u201d people started going off on you? Is that a reason to not say sorry to your SIL? Were you answering for SIL when she was standing right next to you? You clearly walked off because you were embarrassed by your statements. Did you really expect Reddit to respond any differently?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have something nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all. YTA.", "YTA . You too jealous to keep your mouth shut. You are immature for involving yourself in someone's conversation and then demanding they change the subject for you.", "YTA. Why were you so upset about this? Does she not deserve to be celebrated for her accomplishments, even if they\u2019re small compared to some standard you\u2019ve got in your head?", "YTA 100%. You said a ridiculously cruel thing to someone for no reason. Most people would be supportive of someone who is clearly struggling but is taking a positive step in the right direction. You for some reason chose this moment to make someone feel awful because\u2026 you were annoyed?", "YTA. Are you a child?", "YTA 100%. \u201cShe just seems to be slacking off sometimes\u201d? \u201cI\u2019ve tried to help her out\u201d? How arrogant are you to think you can judge other people\u2019s lives? I have to imagine everyone in that room breathed a sigh of relief when you left.", "Yep, YTA.", "Yta so you interrupted someone else's conversation,  and got told off? That also is something people learn at 16.", "YTA. You let past dynamics getting into that particular moment. She was expressing an achievement, everyone was congratulating her, you judged her and downgraded her. You could just have gone to the toilet and excuse yourself.", "YTA, and honestly sound like you're jealous that people were talking about someone other than you. \n\nIt sounds like the other guests kept asking her questions because they were interested. You do not get to dictate what other people are allowed to talk about (other than perhaps banning broad topics like politics or medical issues from the dinner table, if they are likely to be unappetizing or cause arguments). \n\nSIL tried to clue you in to this fact, but apparently you were just out for a fight.", "Wow.  Jealous much?  YTA.  Your SIL got a new job and her family is interested in hearing about it.", "YTA. You were jealous because you weren\u2019t the center of attention and believe you are justified in taking attention away from someone else.", "YTA so her family isn't allowed to ask her about her new job? I mean if you didn't want to talk about it as your sil said... why didn't you just leave the conversation?", "YTA and that's from us just hearing your side of it. People wanted to talk about her new job. Your SIL is right, if you didn't want to be part of the conversation you didn't have to be but it was rude to keep trying to change the subject. You didn't like that so yoy were incredibly rude and insulting to her and it was clear you were in the wrong as the other people there all thought so too.\n\nWhy do you think you were justified in stopping people talk about her new job and insulting it and her? You thinking it's not a very good job is no excuse for your behaviour and your husband is right that you created the scene.", "Are you always this insufferable? \n\n>me relatives kept asking about SIL's new job, when she'll be moving etc. I tried to change the topic, but my SIL got kind of pissed and said something like \"You don't have to be a part of this conversation\".

YTA, sorry...", "YTA. Her family was proud of her. If you didn\u2019t want to hear it you could\u2019ve walked away.

Act like their totally justified response to you being intentionally horrible is \u201csnarky\u201d or \u201cgoing off.\u201d Those words and phrases have connotation, you know it, and you are intentionally misusing them to make yourself into the victim where you are the clear aggressor. \n\nWhat. Did. She. Ever. Do. To. You?\n\n> I ~~eventually~~ [finally] walked off \n\nIt\u2019s about damn time.

I got an \"entry\" level position 5 yr ago, because I was changing my career pretty substantially. My first job out of grad school 15 yr before that was \"entry\" level for what it was. But I have been working since I was 12, and had a paper route. And every job I had before my post-grad role was basically \"entry level\"- from waiting tables to retail. All of them paid bills. All of them gave experience.  And all were legit options at each stage I was at in each case. And this is just to point out that \"entry\" level does not mean anything- entry level as a retail associate at Wal Mart is completely different than \"entry\" level software engineer at Google, for instance. Heck, Floor manger at a grocery store is not nearly as \"successful\" if defined solely by money and prestige, compared to that same entry level Google job.
