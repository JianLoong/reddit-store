We have six and twelve month internships. This post is about a woman (22) in the program, I\u2019ll call her Hester. I noticed Hester hugged her classmates a lot. It was something I brought up in our One on Ones because it seemed excessive. She didn't seem to like that feedback but didn\u2019t say anything.  \n\nAround December she tried to hug me at a company function. Her review was the next day so I brought it up again. Saying she needed to keep her hands to herself, that this was a work place and not a social club, and reminded her that a lot of people, including myself, do not like being hugged. She argued with me and said it was how she greeted people and shared a connection with them. I told her she needed to find another way of doing so. She got sulky and I don\u2019t feel like we came to much of an understanding, despite my efforts to talk through it. I told her that this would be the last time I would be willing to have this conversation with her. \n\nA new intern program joined us a couple weeks ago. On Monday, two of them came into my office and wanted to talk about Hester. Apparently, she had been constantly hugging on them, despite them both telling her to stop. I apologized to them and also had some conversations with the teams the interns worked with and this had been an ongoing problem.   \n\nWednesday I brought Hester into my office and told her that she could no longer be part of the program. I explained that we had talked about this twice before, that she was making people uncomfortable, and she appeared to not be picking up on work place norms. She was not happy about this and ended up needing to be escorted out. Yesterday and today I\u2019ve been getting calls from her parents and her professor, saying she needs this internship and that they don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal and I shouldn\u2019t have fired her for it. They haven\u2019t explicitly called me an asshole, but have definitely implied it.", "created_utc": 1674844829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10msds4/aita_for_firing_an_intern_because_she_wouldnt/", "score": 4632, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was crossing boundaries and did not care.  More than that, she did not care that she was invading other people\u2019s space and making them uncomfortable.  Her desire to hug people DOES NOT trump other people\u2019s desire not to be touched.  Her behavior was unprofessional and should not be tolerated.  You were right to fire her. \n\nHer parents and professor need to get a grip.  If Hester were a man, I am sure they would get it.", "NTA. In a workplace environment this is called sexual harassment, and Hester\u2019s future employers can face legal trouble if they do nothing. The fact that Hester is being given basic instructions like *You Do Not Touch People Without Consent* and can\u2019t follow them is beyond problematic, it\u2019s a lawsuit waiting to happen.", "NTA. I dont see that you had another choice here.\n\nYou did give me a laugh about how weird and wrong it would be if one of my work colleagues tried to hug. Am uncomfortable just imagining it lol", "So, she was told to stop more than one time, people complained about it and once you fired her she needed to be escorted out.\n\nWhat more was she supposed to do for you to not even consider being an asshole?\n\nNTA she is others problem now, especially since it could have been solved so easily", "NTA. \n>Apparently, she had been constantly hugging on them, despite them both telling her to stop\n\n**No means no**. There's the line. If people have objected to physical touching, she needs to respect those boundaries, not simply as a workplace norm: it's the law. IIRC: attempting to make unwanted physical contact is assault and battery is the unwanted touching of another person. The challenge here is not about \"integrating into a workplace culture\". That's totally minimizing the problem. She's been criminally violating others consent and bodily autonomy. She's lucky that nobody is pressing charges despite repeated offenses.\n\nHR needs to know about what happened because this is a huge liability for the company. You need to stop taking calls from them and stop talking to third parties (prof & parents) about a 22 year old adult's sexual harassment case. Double check that you documented all the warnings and escalation, and I would add an internal note that the professor is complicit in this foolishness. The fact that they don't consider actual crime in the workplace to be \"a big deal\" is a huge red flag for the institution and the culture of its faculty. I don't even want to start thinking about the Title IX implications because of its link to an educational institute.", "NTA...Unwanted touching is unwanted touching. She was warned.", "Even if one were to take the stance that hugging people at work should be ok/normal, multiple people are asking her to stop hugging them specifically and she's ignoring their wishes. Her need to \"connect\" with people shouldn't supercede someone else's right to their own personal space. I don't think it'd even be a conversation to be had if the person in question was a guy (which would be equally unacceptable). \n\nYou gave them ample warning, NTA", "NTA. This is inappropriate behavior. Had it been a man doing this it would be an HR issue. She was redirected and ignored it. I also do not like being touched, especially if I farted recently. It's weird.", "NTA.  You didn't have a choice.  People she tired to hug asked her to stop and she did not. You warned her twice and she continued.  She must learn now that she's not allowed to ignore the request of others that she not touch them and learn that she must take direction from superiors.  Hopefully, she learns from this and matures.\n\nETA: You do not report to people outside your organization on employment issues. You do not report to the parents of employees and it's inappropriate to discuss employees with others including their parents and prof.", "NTA.  Hester's behavior is definitely inappropriate and unprofessional--and might even subject your company to civil liability/a lawsuit, depending on the laws where you live.  As she is an intern, you are supposed to tell her what is inappropriate behavior, so she doesn't do that when she gets paid employment. (Actually, I would think any 22 year old would already know not to hug people in a professional setting, but apparently not).\n\nIf these internships are through a college or university, I would seriously consider contacting that institution and telling them that a professor, in their employ, thinks it is okay for people to hug other people in the workplace, is harassing you with multiple phone calls about this situtation, and that your company may need to reconsider hiring interns from this place of higher learning.  I would also mention you are not someone who needs to take criticism from one of their employees, when your company is doing the university/college a favor by hiring interns in the first place.  The parents, alas, would seem to be  lost cause--just tell them to stop callling you or you will report them to law enforcement.  Sorry you have to deal with idiots all around--Hester/ her parents/ Professor.  A true trifecta of stupid.", "NTA. This is called sexual harassment and she was refusing to stop even after being talked to.\n\nYou did the right thing by letting her go. If they keep calling saying she needs to work, simply remind them she was let go for cause and ask they stop messaging you.", "NTA. You alredy warned her twice and she still would't stop, even after other people also told her", "NTA  \n\n\nany unwanted touch is bad touch, if she did not get that well that is why she lost the internship", "NTA\n\nyou have kindly told her to stop hugging people left and right, because some people yourself included are uncomfortable about being constantly hugged out of the blue.\n\nBeside it's true that hugging is one way to \"greet\" and \"connect\" with people, but like you said yourself it's not the only way to greet and connect with people and she refused to listen and when you suddenly was approached by 2 of the new intern came up to and reported that they have been hugged despite making it 100% clear that they didn't like it and she choose to ignore it. As the manager of internships you have to keep the peace and warn those that makes problem for both themselves and the other interns as well and if the only way to keep this peace is to kick those that have been given warnings and chosen to ignore them, then you have to do it otherwise you would be demoted at best and fired at worst.\n\nHer parents and professor seems to enable her behavior though and it's not your problem if she needs this internship what is your problem on the other hand is that she is causing problems and that's your duty to stop it first with warnings and next to fire the person that caused trouble in the first place if they choose to ignore the warnings!!\n\nThe AH's are the parents and professor for not only ignore but also enable the behavior that they themselves should know is unacceptable.", "NTA - this kind of coaching on professional behavior is exactly what you are supposed to be learning in an internship. Instead she demonstrated zero listening skills or boundaries, violated sexual harassment policy, and then has her parents AND a professor (?! which just blows my mind) try and run interference??? Welcome to the real world, kiddo!", ">> Apparently, she had been constantly hugging on them, despite them both telling her to stop\n\nWhat she\u2019s doing is sexual harassment. It *doesn\u2019t fucking matter* if her parents and professor don\u2019t think it\u2019s a \u201cbig deal.\u201d She has repeatedly been told to stop and has ignored this to the point that it\u2019s interfering with other people\u2019s ability to perform their jobs comfortably and efficiently. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. She was warned twice. Multiple people told her they didn't like her hugging them and she kept doing it anyway. Gotta grow up sometime.", "NTA shouldn't even need an explanation", "NTA you gave her a chance to stop, two even. You can\u2019t just keep letting her make people feel uncomfortable, you did what you had to do", "NTA. You explained to her that it was making people uncomfortable, and she didn't seem to understand. The only things I can say you could have done better are:\n\n* You could have suggested something else she could have done (i.e., why not high-five? hand shake?)\n* Or, since I saw you say it was through a university and you have someone you coordinate with, you could have brought that individual in sooner (before she was let go) to assist you in explaining why that's not okay/explain alternatives to that behavior\n* Or, what may have worked better, was clearly explain to her that it's a HR problem and that hugging people without consent/when they're not comfortable can be construed as SA and to many warnings over this behavior will result in her being let go (I say clearly because sometimes \"this is the last time I will have this conversation with you\" does not convey to everyone \"if this happens again I will need to fire you\")\n\nIt sounds like she may have some social awkwardness/struggle with social skills, but ultimately you're NTA for letting her go.

Her behavior is unprofessional and unacceptable. The work place is not a place where you hug your colleagues. \n\nHer actions alone are enough for her to be fired. Hester\u2019s behavior is actually made worse as her BOSS  and COLLEAGUES to STOP. I hope that this is what you told her parents. \n\nI\u2019m a corporate setting, she would be fire for sexual harassment. Inappropriate touching is covered under that umbrella. You did the right thing.

Maybe she will do better in the future. Probably not if she is such a child she has mommy and daddy calling, but maybe.", "NTA \n\nShe is acting inappropriately in the workplace. She was reprimanded and refused to comply. She needs to learn proper behavior.", "NTA. What she did is sexual harassment, plain and simple. She was warned about this. She continued not only in general, but with people that had specifically told her that they themselves didn't want it. I mean, if the team members were ok with the hugs, that would be one thing, but they told her to stop as well.", "NTA\n\nYou handled this properly, clearly she has some kind of psychological obsession with hugging.\n\nThere are also cultural norms at play, I lived in the USA for a long time and they are a nation of huggers, I often found it uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nAnd thank you from the millions of us for whom random hugs or any form of uninvited touch is an extreme trigger. I still remember the first time I said no to abuse and it worked. Thank you for saying no for all your other employees.", "NTA is this a intern ship with people with special needs or something that might prevent a 22 yr old from understanding hands to yourself? If not, then she was given clear instructions and boundaries, but chose to ignore them. That is her own fault and her parents and professors need to stop coddling her.", "Nta. It's a simple rule in a work place environment and life in general, keep your hands to yourself.", "NTA\n\nMaybe fine if she had people she'd become friends with in the workplace who welcomed it, but hugging everyone even after some people asked her not to is potential grounds for some kind of SA complaint. Sorry, but you gotta go.", "NTA. She needs to learn proper behaviors for an office.", "NTA. You gave her *two* chances, after explicitly telling her to stop. She also proved she wasn't capable of stopping after being directly asked by her co-workers. She's 22. \n\nI don't know if there's more going on mentally, or culturally, but it's irrelevant because she can't follow workplace policies that have been explained to her. I can't think of any place of professional employment that would allow this behavior (unless they both consent, but even then you have to tread cautiously). Hopefully she learns that quickly. \n\nShe could've switched to handshakes or something, which gives the people the option to say no, or at least comes with a more professional connotation.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were right to fire her. YOu needed to protect the other employees from her assholery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were not able to wait any longer.

So: You did the right thing, and you had no other option left.", "NTA. If she was a guy they probably would have gone right to HR. She had plenty of chances. And a big part of an internship is learning how to behave in a professional environment. She outright refused.", "NTA  you gave her enough warnings and she failed to listen", "Nta. \n\nIf you are told to stop once. But keep doing it it's considered harassment. Unwanted touching and hugs are considered sexual harassment. \n\nIf she got a warning. Then another.  Next, it's time to leave. 3 strikes you are out. \n\nSexual harassment lawsuits do not look good for any company. There is no need to have that liability burden for the company.", "NTA\n\nImagine if Hester had been a man. It would have seemed a lot creepier if he wouldn't have stopped hugging his female colleagues. \nYou did the right thing.\nAnd since it is just an internship, firing someone isn't as bad as when you have job-bills to pay tbh.

Multiple people told her to stop and yet she continued. This is sexual harassment. You personally warned her twice, and said it was her last warning.

Just because Hester thinks hugs are \"nice\" doesn't mean everyone welcomes them.\n\nI went to college with a girl like Hester who hugged everyone. This girl, lets call her Liz, was very offended if you wouldn't hug her back. I had recently gone through a trauma where I didn't want any physical contact with anyone at all, not even my parents. Every time Liz hugged me I would recoil and explain to her that the hugs were not welcome, that it caused me great distress, and to stop doing it. I offered her alternatives to hugs that still made her feel like we had a meaningful greeting. But nothing would satisfy her. Apparently her hugs were SO GOOD that they would cure me of my trauma if I just let her or something. We went through this a handful of times and I started avoiding her as much as possible.\n\nFinally one day she snuck up on me in the dining hall and gave me a hug from behind, I had no idea she was there. I BLEW UP. I screamed at her to stop fucking touching me, how many times do I have to tell you, wtf if your problem, no means no etc. She bursts into big fat crocodile tears, just sobbing about how I'm being so mean and she doesn't mean it like that and how everyone else likes her hugs. I told her I didn't give a shit what other people like, I DON'T LIKE IT and I told her to stop. She ran off and avoided me like the plague after that which was fine with me. What astounded me though was how many people defended her, saying she was just trying to be nice etc. In my view she was just trying to make herself feel good by positioning her sense of self as someone who gives hugs and makes other people feel better. And if other people buy that then fine, who cares. But you don't get to force yourself onto people just so you can collect feel good points.\n\nSo yeah I don't like Hesters or Lizs and you did the right thing.

It's a meaningless statement in the face of what you were telling her, which was that *who she is (or in this case what she was doing - hugging people repeatedly, without their consent and despite their discomfort) was VERY UNPROFESSIONAL*. \"This is how I greet people\" is not an appropriate, or even a rational, response to, \"How you are greeting people in this workplace is inappropriate and unprofessional.\" Obviously you were already AWARE that that was how she was greeting people, or you wouldn't have been addressing it with her as an issue of concern. \n\nThe fact that you said to her, \"Your way of greeting people is not workplace-appropriate,\" and her response was, \"But that's how I greet people,\" makes her sound (and I say this with the gentlest of intentions) genuinely intellectually disabled.

If she literally is not ABLE to greet people without hugging them, or understand something as simple as, \"What you are doing is unprofessional and you need to stop doing it,\" then not only does she not belong in the workplace . . . she belongs in a supportive care facility, because the implication is that in the most literal sense, she has no control over her own behaviour, and we do not leave people like that to wander about the world unsupervised. \n\nAlso, no one needs to \"share a connection\" with workplace colleagues or clients through physically affectionate gestures like hugging. Again, unprofessional and inappropriate. \n\nYou were 100% right, and her response was just evidence of that. That she \"needed\" the internship was irrelevant.
