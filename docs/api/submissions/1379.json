And, it does not sound like the hospital or his care providers found the oil excessive or damaging to his care.\n\nAs an atheist you may not understand, but this type of ritual does tend to be very important for religious people who follow these practices. It is usually meant as a last ditch intervention to either get God to perform a miracle to heal the sick person or, if that's not allowed, to ensure the sick person's entrance to heaven when they die. (I think some non Christian religions have similar practices with similar purposes, but would need to research more to speak on that.)\n\nIt is also important to understand that there have been studies showing value to religious and spiritual practices for the benefit of sick people if those people know about and value the religious or spiritual practice.

Yes, he's her son but the two of you are married. Would she like it if someone just brought someone in and did the same to her husband behind her back? At least a sit down and gentle discussion about why she would want it done, would husband want it done etc.", "I agree! Need more info about Hubby\u2019s beliefs\u2026", "OP says in another comment that her husband shares his mom\u2019s beliefs.", "I am wondering the same thing. What is the husbands opinion of this?", "THIS.  People seem to be just glossing over the fact that she\u2019s said HE WAS RELIGIOUS and she\u2019s not! She\u2019s basically disrespecting his religion by not allowing any specific rites to be performed because she doesn\u2019t want them done.  Ok cool but what about HIM and what HE wants.", "Correct me if I'm wrong (haven't been to church in years) but isn't that done with a cross on the forehead, not all over the body? It seems to me someone might be exaggerating the story to make herself look better.", "Yes. And I'm fine with that although I'm an athiest.", "totally agree! firstly, i too don't believe he was covered in oil from head to foot. that's not good they do it. they put a few drops on the forehead or head only. \n\nsecondly, you ARE being selfish. period. is this negativity surrounding your husband's possible last days really worth it? geez.\n\nfigure out visiting times that work best for you and her that don't overlap and get on with it. holy cow!", "Nurses don\u2019t have time to sit around and watch visitors.", "OP said the hospital approved it. I believe she must have way over-exaggerated how much oil was involved.", "Some of the wackier (for lack of a better term) Protestant sects do this. There was a church in Tennessee that kept a Bible absolutely drenched in oil that they would lay on people's heads. As you can imagine, it was quite messy. I vaguely recall some flavor of Black Baptist preacher my family followed when I was growing up in rural Florida that would do oil \"baptisms\".", "He shares the same beliefs he would 100% want his mother to do this", "Very well stated. YTA.", "Yeah the amount of oil didn't ring true for me either.", "Yeah, i worked at a Christian radio station, you use annoiting oil and prayer when you are asking God to heal, or for more time.", "yeah uh, OP's MIL is batshit", "In some cultures, it\u2019s the entire body.", "And you don\u2019t think there\u2019s a chance OP is exaggerating?", "Actually the next of kin can make those decisions, in my state at least. I don\u2019t know about other countries.", "She might not be able to get her banned from the hospital, but if she\u2019s in the US she can certainly ban her from getting into husbands room and from receiving any information from doctors or nurses.  The wife legally is the next of kin and doesn\u2019t have to share info or allow any visitors she doesn\u2019t want.", "Yes, I spoke to the nurse and her response scared me. She said that some people do this when their loved ones are dying and it's called anoiting. I don't know much about these practices, I'm an athiest.", "Who has medical authority in this situation? Probably the wife. Doesn\u2019t matter what the mother wants if wife is the one in charge.", "Because it's a religious practice and her husband shares those beliefs.", "You think the nurses have the time to provide 1 on 1 supervision when their patient has visitors?", "As long as the oil wasn\u2019t in such a volume that it caused safety issues/infection risk then it would absolutely be allowed. We lube folks up with various moisturizers all the time. It would absolutely be allowed in an end of life situation for religious reasons. \n\nI think it\u2019s also fair to assume OP is over exaggerating a tiny bit as they think the practice is silly/insignificant to begin with. It likely wasn\u2019t that much oil.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. It's hard as it is but to deal with this as well? It's exahusting.", "But certain things in relation to religion are done by people of the church, not by church members and the mother's. And I highly doubt they put oil all over somebody's body. I'm also pretty sure the hospital would not have allowed that to occur.", "How did her husband allow it? I thought he was on a ventilator?", "Right. I am not religious at all. My parents are. If I were gravely ill and they wanted to have some sort of anointing or blessing for me, have at it. It\u2019ll comfort them.", "Can be done in multiple ways, but usually not over all of the body (although this is a valid form AFAIK).", "So if he shares her beliefs he would let her put this oil on him, right?", "Then YTA", "It depends on the severity of needs. When my son was in PICU he had a 1-1 nurse. His nurse literally sat on the other side of a window and watched him twelve hours a day. If his nurse was on break another nurse had to cover them. Eventually it will go 1-2 and then 1-3. Once they no longer need that level of care they will be on a general floor. OP's husband is in a ventilator so he's probably in ICU. If he's in ICU his nurse has at most two, maybe three, other patients.\n\nETA I don't think they are just sitting there doing nothing. If you need a one on one nurse you are extremely ill.", "Yes they do - especially if it\u2019s an ICU patient (eta he\u2019s likely icu since on a vent). The nurse is in that room constantly for medications, machine checks etc. If they can\u2019t do a quick scan of the patient and whatever a visitor is doing in the room, that\u2019s bad nursing.", "Ya it\u2019s hard to know the details. I could see the nurse/doctor being \u201csure whatever\u201d for a small amount, but I could also see the family putting too much or overdoing it by accident or on purpose", "Yeah that was my guess as well is she is over exaggerating how much oil", "I grew up with holy oil in religious practices. If she did it this way (it all depends on the religion but it usually is similar), you will make a cross on the forehead, tops of the hands, palms and she most likely did tops and bottoms of feet. It's oil so, while he probably didn't sheen like Edward in Twilight but his hands/arms. Feet and legs had a nice gradient going on if she rubbed it in, which she probably did.", "I mean, not necessarily? Just the fact that he's married to a non-believer speaks that he's probably a lot more nuanced in his beliefs than his mother is. \n\nBut the point is they can't ask now, and his mother should have asked his wife if it was something she was comfortable with them doing. Or argued the case with proof that it was something he would want. \n\nedit: small addition", "That's why talking about \"end of life\" (or really sick without being able to tell people what you want or don't want) is so important. I know it sucks but do it!!!!", "Had no idea this was actually possible in some countries.", "That\u2019s only for the forehead oil could ignite \n\nThey didn\u2019t ok a full jiffy-Lube botch.", "If they\u2019re catholic, this would be Anointing of the Sick. They don\u2019t pour oil over you. It\u2019s just a dab on the forehead and then some prayers are said.", "Head to toe?\n\nI grew up in a church and I've been anointed and prayed over several times in my life\n\nIt's only ever been on the head, (or the direct body part that needed healing if it was illness or injury) , and then I was prayed over, and the oil was wiped off.\n\nI get that she's processing, but,  head to toe? Really? I don't know if any denomination that does that. \n\nThough, since your husband is a believer, it is cruel to withhold prayer from him, those are his beliefs and you don't get to decide he can't be prayed over. But, she went overboard with that oil. If she anointed him normally (a small cross on the head is what most people I know do) I don't think they're would be an issue. Definitely set some boundaries, but keeping even a crazy woman away from her dying son is kinda cruel. \n\nStill my mind is blown that she did HEAD TO TOE.  That's just.... overboard. No matter the beliefs.", "Well I know about it. It doesn't hurt and it can be done more than once, if by luck the patient recover (some of my grandparents did this sacrament 3-4 times).\nI'm agnostic, but I grew up catholic - so it's something very common for a lot of people on earth. I would probably want to do that myself if I were close to death. It would bring some comfort and mind peace.\nSo YTA. You may not be religious, but let religious people get their comfort and safe practices in such difficult moments. It's not for you, it's for your husband. He would probably want it, if he could speak for himself.", "Anointing the sick lubricates the entry into paradise\n\nHow could that be a bad thing. In fact your husband might feel you are sabotaging his death.\n\nIf she poured a bottle of olive oil over him; no good. If she dabbed 3 dots on his forehead, perfectly kosher. Lord Ganesha & mighty Thor am I mixing religions here.\n\nBut I think the problem is you feel it's preparing him to die. Think of it instead as an insurance policy that if he dies he'll get favourable treatment. You don't buy car insurance because you expect to get in an accident.", "YTA but i hope this just come from ignorance, the ritual with oils is mainly intended for healing is pretty much a last resort and I think that's why many people think is some kind of dead ritual wich is not.  I get that you want whats is best for your husband and you need to accept the fact that it's something that you might not want.", "This wasn\u2019t a medical treatment, it was a religious ritual, and the husband follows that religion. He would like likely want it.", "Oh she\u2019s totally over exaggerating that part for sure.  I worked icu for a long time and have seen situations like this a lot, but I guarantee you there wasn\u2019t the amount of oil she\u2019s trying to claim there was lol.", "I have friends who would freak out if this was done to them without their consent- partner would know and step in. If parents waited for their partner to leave so then they could do it, that would be super shady on their part.", "In my case, I wouldn\u2019t want it done. So in cases like this, would the husband object? If the answer is yes, then the mother can\u2019t do it.", "Not soak  him in it like she\u2019s trying to rust-proof him.", "Really? This seems reasonable to me. What if people you are in bad relationships/no contact with try to visit?", "But your question was absolutely right, how would her husband feel about what was done?!", "This made me laugh", "By a priest.", "Catholic Anointing of the Sick involves a little oil being dabbed onto not just the forehead, but the hands and feet, too, provided they're accessible. Some priests are more... exuberant than others.", "I believe, if I remember correctly, it's on the forehead and palms of hands. But it's been a long time since I've been Catholic.", "But just because you've seen it where you work, doesn't mean that that's true in all cases.", "I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to know what husband thought and as per OPs comment, husband shared the mother\u2019s religious beliefs.", "Who does that to anoint? Our priest usually just uses a little oil upon forehead.", "That\u2019s why you need to have all the correct paperwork in order in case something like this happens. You can appoint someone to have medical power of attorney and/or a healthcare proxy.", "Thank you St Frances. Yes. By a priest.", "OP said the person who \u201cpoured\u201d oil on him was \u201csomeone from the church\u201d, so hopefully a priest or someone otherwise \u201cqualified\u201d", "Doesn't have to be a priest. Anointing of the Sick is also known as Extreme Unction or Last Rites. Anyone can perform it if a priest isn't handy. And it can be done at any point during an illness.", "I did not know that! I like learning new things!", "No practice would allow that much as they wouldn't be able to work around it. Messy sheets etc.\n\nFew dabs here and there and a cross on the head sounds a bit more realistic.", "In Ortodoxy they put it on hands and feet too.\n\nI suppose OP is exagerating the quantaty of oil, not because she's lying, she could have a wrong impression.", "Ex-mormon here \n\nMormons have a similar \"ritual\" except it doesn't' have to be a priest. It can be literally any man in the church over a certain age (one who holds the \"priesthood\") I have a lot of memories of my dad anointing my head with oil and administering blessings when I was sick. Or on the odd night, he'd leave because someone at the hospital needed a blessing.", "Not saying she is lying, just never heard of a religion who covered someone head to foot.... That is a lot of oil to carry around.", "Fair enough, I edited a bit to include other \u201cqualified\u201d individuals", "This would be like 1 gal or smth like that... kind of impossible.", "Oh no worries, I just wanted to throw in that little tidbit!"]}
