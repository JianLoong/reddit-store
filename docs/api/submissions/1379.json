And, it does not sound like the hospital or his care providers found the oil excessive or damaging to his care.\n\nAs an atheist you may not understand, but this type of ritual does tend to be very important for religious people who follow these practices. It is usually meant as a last ditch intervention to either get God to perform a miracle to heal the sick person or, if that's not allowed, to ensure the sick person's entrance to heaven when they die. (I think some non Christian religions have similar practices with similar purposes, but would need to research more to speak on that.)\n\nIt is also important to understand that there have been studies showing value to religious and spiritual practices for the benefit of sick people if those people know about and value the religious or spiritual practice.

Yes, he's her son but the two of you are married. Would she like it if someone just brought someone in and did the same to her husband behind her back?

What is the husbands opinion of this?", "THIS.  People seem to be just glossing over the fact that she\u2019s said HE WAS RELIGIOUS and she\u2019s not! She\u2019s basically disrespecting his religion by not allowing any specific rites to be performed because she doesn\u2019t want them done.  Ok cool but what about HIM and what HE wants.", "Correct me if I'm wrong (haven't been to church in years) but isn't that done with a cross on the forehead, not all over the body?

And I'm fine with that although I'm an athiest.", "totally agree! firstly, i too don't believe he was covered in oil from head to foot. that's not how they do it. they put a few drops on the forehead or head only. \n\nsecondly, you ARE being selfish. period. is this negativity surrounding your husband's possible last days really worth it? geez.\n\nfigure out visiting times that work best for you and her that don't overlap and get on with it. holy cow!", "Nurses don\u2019t have time to sit around and watch visitors.", "OP said the hospital approved it. I believe she must have way over-exaggerated how much oil was involved.", "Some of the wackier (for lack of a better term) Protestant sects do this. There was a church in Tennessee that kept a Bible absolutely drenched in oil that they would lay on people's heads. As you can imagine, it was quite messy.

YTA.", "Yeah the amount of oil didn't ring true for me either.", "Yeah, i worked at a Christian radio station, you use annoiting oil and prayer when you are asking God to heal, or for more time.", "yeah uh, OP's MIL is batshit", "In some cultures, it\u2019s the entire body.", "And you don\u2019t think there\u2019s a chance OP is exaggerating?", "Actually the next of kin can make those decisions, in my state at least. I don\u2019t know about other countries.", "She might not be able to get her banned from the hospital, but if she\u2019s in the US she can certainly ban her from getting into husbands room and from receiving any information from doctors or nurses.

She said that some people do this when their loved ones are dying and it's called anoiting. I don't know much about these practices, I'm an athiest.", "Who has medical authority in this situation? Probably the wife. Doesn\u2019t matter what the mother wants if wife is the one in charge.", "Because it's a religious practice and her husband shares those beliefs.", "You think the nurses have the time to provide 1 on 1 supervision when their patient has visitors?", "As long as the oil wasn\u2019t in such a volume that it caused safety issues/infection risk then it would absolutely be allowed. We lube folks up with various moisturizers all the time. It would absolutely be allowed in an end of life situation for religious reasons. \n\nI think it\u2019s also fair to assume OP is over exaggerating a tiny bit as they think the practice is silly/insignificant to begin with.

It's exahusting.", "But certain things in relation to religion are done by people of the church, not by church members and the mother's. And I highly doubt they put oil all over somebody's body. I'm also pretty sure the hospital would not have allowed that to occur.", "How did her husband allow it? I thought he was on a ventilator?", "Right. I am not religious at all. My parents are. If I were gravely ill and they wanted to have some sort of anointing or blessing for me, have at it. It\u2019ll comfort them.", "Can be done in multiple ways, but usually not over all of the body (although this is a valid form AFAIK).", "So if he shares her beliefs he would let her put this oil on him, right?", "Then YTA", "It depends on the severity of needs. When my son was in PICU he had a 1-1 nurse. His nurse literally sat on the other side of a window and watched him twelve hours a day. If his nurse was on break another nurse had to cover them. Eventually it will go 1-2 and then 1-3. Once they no longer need that level of care they will be on a general floor. OP's husband is in a ventilator so he's probably in ICU. If he's in ICU his nurse has at most two, maybe three, other patients.\n\nETA I don't think they are just sitting there doing nothing. If you need a one on one nurse you are extremely ill.", "Yes they do - especially if it\u2019s an ICU patient (eta he\u2019s likely icu since on a vent). The nurse is in that room constantly for medications, machine checks etc. If they can\u2019t do a quick scan of the patient and whatever a visitor is doing in the room, that\u2019s bad nursing.", "Ya it\u2019s hard to know the details. I could see the nurse/doctor being \u201csure whatever\u201d for a small amount, but I could also see the family putting too much or overdoing it by accident or on purpose", "Yeah that was my guess as well is she is over exaggerating how much oil", "I grew up with holy oil in religious practices. If she did it this way (it all depends on the religion but it usually is similar), you will make a cross on the forehead, tops of the hands, palms and she most likely did tops and bottoms of feet. It's oil so, while he probably didn't sheen like Edward in Twilight but his hands/arms. Feet and legs had a nice gradient going on if she rubbed it in, which she probably did.", "I mean, not necessarily? Just the fact that he's married to a non-believer speaks that he's probably a lot more nuanced in his beliefs than his mother is. \n\nBut the point is they can't ask now, and his mother should have asked his wife if it was something she was comfortable with them doing. Or argued the case with proof that it was something he would want. \n\nedit: small addition", "That's why talking about \"end of life\" (or really sick without being able to tell people what you want or don't want) is so important.

Really? I don't know if any denomination that does that. \n\nThough, since your husband is a believer, it is cruel to withhold prayer from him, those are his beliefs and you don't get to decide he can't be prayed over. But, she went overboard with that oil. If she anointed him normally (a small cross on the head is what most people I know do) I don't think they're would be an issue. Definitely set some boundaries, but keeping even a crazy woman away from her dying son is kinda cruel. \n\nStill my mind is blown that she did HEAD TO TOE.  That's just.... overboard. No matter the beliefs.", "Well I know about it. It doesn't hurt and it can be done more than once, if by luck the patient recover (some of my grandparents did this sacrament 3-4 times).\nI'm agnostic, but I grew up catholic - so it's something very common for a lot of people on earth. I would probably want to do that myself if I were close to death. It would bring some comfort and mind peace.\nSo YTA. You may not be religious, but let religious people get their comfort and safe practices in such difficult moments. It's not for you, it's for your husband. He would probably want it, if he could speak for himself.", "Anointing the sick lubricates the entry into paradise\n\nHow could that be a bad thing. In fact your husband might feel you are sabotaging his death.\n\nIf she poured a bottle of olive oil over him; no good. If she dabbed 3 dots on his forehead, perfectly kosher. Lord Ganesha & mighty Thor am I mixing religions here.\n\nBut I think the problem is you feel it's preparing him to die. Think of it instead as an insurance policy that if he dies he'll get favourable treatment. You don't buy car insurance because you expect to get in an accident.", "YTA but i hope this just come from ignorance, the ritual with oils is mainly intended for healing is pretty much a last resort and I think that's why many people think is some kind of dead ritual wich is not.

Because when he woke up he could still indicate yes or no (the only things he could). I asked him at one point if he could remember and hear what went on while he was seemingly unconscious (we\u2019d read to him, shared stories from the past, told him about our lives). He made it crystal clear, multiple times, that yes, he had heard and understood the interactions that we\u2019d been having with him. \n\nThis might very well be the case with your husband. If these are his final days, give just a shred of consideration that the last thing he could hear/experience is his own mother being kept away when he\u2019s on his deathbed, his wife being upset and clearly hating his mom, and what seems like the entire family fighting about it. What sort of a way is that to leave this life? You should be filling his final days with happiness, things that he likes, and, most importantly, family. That last day that my Dad was alive, I arranged for his out of town brother to come in and visit with him. Even though my Dad was literally dying and mostly paralysed, the second his brother walked in the room, he locked his eyes on mine, somehow actually lifted his arm off the hospital bed, and when I came over, gave me the most firm handshake I have ever had in my life. It was a handshake of gratitude - he was thanking me for making it possible for him to see his family. I can\u2019t stress the importance of this enough: look past your hatred (whether of your mother-in-law, organised religion, or both) and give some thought to making your husband\u2019s final days be full of love, rather than hate and conflict. \n\nThis is a terrible situation, and I feel for you for what you\u2019re going through. I know you\u2019re angry, confused, upset and probably looking for someone to blame. But that person is not your mother-in-law.

The 40\u2019s ish dad had a major heart attack and had coded multiple times, he was expected to not live through the night.  When the non-religious wife asked about finding a Catholic priest for him, and asked around if anyone was Catholic because she didn\u2019t know what she should be doing for him, I jumped into the role I\u2019d trained much of my life to fulfill\u2026 I was a Eucharistic minister and had brought communion for my father, instead, I administered last communion to this man.  I brought over a blessed Saint Joseph statue, the patron saint of fathers, that I had brought for my dad\u2019s room, and it watched over this man and his family in their last moments together.  I started making calls and found a local priest to administer last rights in the middle of the night.  And while the wife and children spent their final moment with dad, our in the waiting room, I kept the their HS aged kids support friends occupied by teaching them how to pray the rosary in while sitting in observance of the sick and dying.  The wife was grateful that someone there was someone who knew how to make sure her husband had his spiritual needs met before his final journey.  I firmly believe God puts us where we need to be, when we need to be there in the service of others.  While she may not have been religious at the start of that day, she definitely left there with at least some belief in small divine interventions\u2026 \n\nThat\u2019s how you handle it, that\u2019s how it\u2019s done.", "INFO.

When my brother and I were in middle/HS, we were in tons of music and athletic things together. We spent a lot of time on coach buses in the middle of the night, traveling back to our hometown from cities we\u2019d never been to before, watching out the window as unfamiliar territory turned into home. We would be barreling down strange roads while a stranger drove the bus, surrounded by some people we love, some would be talking and laughing, some asleep, some just lying back and reflecting. For those that weren\u2019t on the bus, we had the understanding we\u2019ll see our other loved ones soon enough. We\u2019d be exhausted and longing for a hug from our parents and rest in our own familiar homes, but still satisfied that we gave everything we had to that performance and had no regrets, because we already did everything we could\u2026 this is what I imagine dying peacefully is like. This is the feeling I took so seriously as a palliative care CNA. Honoring a dying person\u2019s wishes gives them the peace of mind that the bus is taking them home. It allows them to easily drift off to sleep because they know they\u2019ll soon be in their high school\u2019s parking lot, being gently woken up by a friend, and then they\u2019ll step outside to see their mom waiting for them to drive them home. Ignoring or perverting those wishes makes dying feel like they somehow ended up on the wrong coach bus\u2014 they don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going, but they do know it\u2019s going far from home and their loved ones will not be there.", "Anointing involves a few ml of oil.

Plenty of those that ignore obvious solutions that would be found in secular institutions  just so they can cling to dogma.", "Yeah that\u2019s just because of the oxygen, people have died smoking cigarettes whilst on oxygen. Oil/petroleum is just dousing yourself in accelerant", "My father did it the opposite way. We received news that he had blockages in all four coronary arteries, but surgery was useless, because years of undetected, untreated heart attacks had killed the heart tissue the arteries led to. So much of the heart muscle had already died, he would die when his next heart attack came. There was no preventing it, one would come. Because of the heart failure, he also had kidney failure. Our dad was going to die, we just didn\u2019t know how long he had. In the end, he lasted about thirteen months from when he was diagnosed. I hope the doctor that failed to properly treat him initially and gave him chelation treatments instead of sending him to a cardiologist is rotting in hell right now. \n\nAnyway, my dad wasn\u2019t religious. I think he had times in his life that he did have various beliefs, but eventually his personal philosophy was help others when you can, don\u2019t hurt anyone on purpose, make people feel respected, if your ball goes in the water take 2 strokes and move on, and counting cards is okay, as long as you\u2019re not obvious about it. When I was little and would ask him what religion he was, because we attended a Presbyterian church with our mother, which he attended with us a few times a year, he\u2019d tell me Shinto Buddhist. I thought that was something he made up for the longest time. He was halfway pulling it out of his ass, halfway telling a truth, which was his way, because although he didn\u2019t keep an altar, the beliefs themselves fit. He was much more concerned with life and what was done during that time, was it good, was it true. Well, except for the cards thing, but nobody\u2019s perfect, and being smart enough to scam a casino every once in a while doesn\u2019t mean he was a bad person, I don\u2019t think. He definitely wasn\u2019t concerned with dying. He thought he would cease to be, that his energy, whatever made him, would be gone. Maybe it would be recycled in some kind of reincarnation, but he himself would be gone. He was okay with that, and held no fear about it. My sister though, she was a member of a cult-like, conservative, evangelical, Christian church at the time. She\u2019d become so freaking weird. She\u2019d even left home and moved to a different city to be closer to them. She was freaking out that our dad was going to die unsaved. He subjected himself to all the praying she wanted, from her and her greatly pastor. He went along with letting them \u201csave\u201d him, and played it out right so that she thought she had convinced him, not that he was humoring her. I\u2019d sit with him in the hospital every day whenever he had to go stay, since I was on modified bed rest with my first child and wasn\u2019t working, so we spent a lot of time together. I asked him what in the hell he was doing with the Christian stuff I knew he didn\u2019t believe, and he told me that it didn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t believe it, because my sister did. He was going to be gone, it didn\u2019t make any difference to him, but it would make a difference to her for the rest of her life. He could go along with it for her, so she could have her belief that he was saved and would be waiting for her in heaven. He\u2019d even asked for a minister at his funeral, the one from the church we\u2019d grown up attending, not because he wanted it but because he thought that would be what my sister and I would want. Pretty good for a dad who used to play around and pretend to pick our noses during the sermon to piss off our mom up in the choir loft. That trick would get him out of having to go to church for a loooong time. \ud83d\udc9c\u26f3\ufe0f"]}
