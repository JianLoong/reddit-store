I was not home at the time but my ex-husband Rob (37M) was napping at the time our son passed.  I did not blame him because it was a tragic accident and something that could have happened regardless of who was with him. My ex, on the other hand, could not process his guilt and no matter how much therapy he received, he could not move forward.  We amicably split about 4 years ago when he decided that he did not want any more children and I realized I could not just be a bereaved mom but also wanted to be a mom to a child in this life. \n\nI stayed in the home we shared since it was mine before we married but I promised my ex he could continue to come over and spend time in our son\u2019s room because he felt close to Adam when he was in the room.  He continued to do this until I married Sam (39M) about 2 years ago.  We did not live together until then and he was okay with Rob coming over even after we did.  For a while, Rob would stop in once or twice a month but when I became pregnant last year he all but stopped coming.  He may have come once for our son\u2019s birthday. \n\nSo here is the issue, my house has four bedrooms.  I have a stepson (8) who spends 3 nights a week with us so he has a room, we have one, and in August of last year my husband started a remote job so while we originally intended to leave Adam\u2019s room intact, we made the decision to make that the baby\u2019s nursery and the 4th room my husband\u2019s office.  \n\nI delayed our plans to decorate since I wanted my ex to be aware of the plan.  I sent him a few texts that I wanted to talk to him about something important and tried calling a couple of times. I started to believe I might never hear from him again.  I wasn't shocked because he was not thrilled that I was having another baby.  After 3 weeks of no response, we began the really difficult process of packing away my son\u2019s items and redoing the room for my daughter, Sarah, who we welcomed in November. \n\nMy ex reached out after months of no contact and asked if he could stop by on our son\u2019s birthday next week.  I had to tell him that the room was no longer intact and he became irate.  He told me I was the AH for not giving him a chance to see the room one last time. I feel like I tried to reach out a couple of times with no response. He accused me of \u201creplacing\u201d our child with my \u201cnew\u201d family. He is now demanding every single item that belonged to our son because everything is still packed away in the basement. I do have plans for the more treasured items. Am I the AH for not telling him even when he didn't respond?", "created_utc": 1679964201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1246zeu/aita_for_giving_away_my_sons_room_since_he_is_no/", "score": 166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But let me say this, you could have just told him about your plans expecting no response, because I bet he would have read the message anyway.

I mean this as gently as possible to him but you can't live your life protecting a shrine, it's your home, it serves the life you're living and your family needs that space for the best reason, a baby will be sheltered, loved and enjoyed there. \n\nBest of luck, happiness and health with your new baby, please don't stress this was always going to be a little hard to move on whilst he wasn't communicating.", "NTA for moving on, you gave Rob ample chance to come by, he didn't.", "NTA.

You allowed him to come mourn. You tried very hard to reach him. Did he really think it would go on forever? You've managed to move on. You're not letting your grief cripple you.

Does a photo of your Child not do more for him than coming into the room. \n\nI think you can only move on and be happy considering.

Either way he should have a few things, but on your terms.

Losing a child is horrible and the person you are afterwards isn\u2019t the person you were before. You can be a good one, just not the same one.\n\nYou and your ex have very different ways of handling your loss and they aren\u2019t compatible.
