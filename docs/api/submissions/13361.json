I was not home at the time but my ex-husband Rob (37M) was napping at the time our son passed.  I did not blame him because it was a tragic accident and something that could have happened regardless of who was with him. My ex, on the other hand, could not process his guilt and no matter how much therapy he received, he could not move forward.  We amicably split about 4 years ago when he decided that he did not want any more children and I realized I could not just be a bereaved mom but also wanted to be a mom to a child in this life. \n\nI stayed in the home we shared since it was mine before we married but I promised my ex he could continue to come over and spend time in our son\u2019s room because he felt close to Adam when he was in the room.  He continued to do this until I married Sam (39M) about 2 years ago.  We did not live together until then and he was okay with Rob coming over even after we did.  For a while, Rob would stop in once or twice a month but when I became pregnant last year he all but stopped coming.  He may have come once for our son\u2019s birthday. \n\nSo here is the issue, my house has four bedrooms.  I have a stepson (8) who spends 3 nights a week with us so he has a room, we have one, and in August of last year my husband started a remote job so while we originally intended to leave Adam\u2019s room intact, we made the decision to make that the baby\u2019s nursery and the 4th room my husband\u2019s office.  \n\nI delayed our plans to decorate since I wanted my ex to be aware of the plan.  I sent him a few texts that I wanted to talk to him about something important and tried calling a couple of times. I started to believe I might never hear from him again.  I wasn't shocked because he was not thrilled that I was having another baby.  After 3 weeks of no response, we began the really difficult process of packing away my son\u2019s items and redoing the room for my daughter, Sarah, who we welcomed in November. \n\nMy ex reached out after months of no contact and asked if he could stop by on our son\u2019s birthday next week.  I had to tell him that the room was no longer intact and he became irate.  He told me I was the AH for not giving him a chance to see the room one last time. I feel like I tried to reach out a couple of times with no response. He accused me of \u201creplacing\u201d our child with my \u201cnew\u201d family. He is now demanding every single item that belonged to our son because everything is still packed away in the basement. I do have plans for the more treasured items. Am I the AH for not telling him even when he didn't respond?", "created_utc": 1679964201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1246zeu/aita_for_giving_away_my_sons_room_since_he_is_no/", "score": 749, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, you are definitely not the asshole.\n\nI can't say anything about your ex, I have no experience with these things, but it sounds unhealthy with what he's doing to himself. Perhaps he needs the removal of Adam's for him to stop clinging and move on(?)", "NTA.  You've been more than accommodating. You and your new husband have graciously allowed him to come into your home and grieve for years.\n\nBut you need to move forward with your future and family. He's deeply rooted in his grief and the past. This might be what he needed to start moving forward.", "NTA\n\nHe needs therapy and lots of it. Honestly, it sounds like he was lucky he didn\u2019t end up charged with negligence or worse, if he was asleep with a one year old in the house when something happened to the child. He needs to move on.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo no contact with him?", "Nta . You tried multiple times to reach out and it's not like you blindsided him he clearly knew eventually now that you remarried there might have been a possibility of getting pregnant again", "NTA\n\nI am so incredibly sorry for your loss. \n\nYou did all you could to reach out to him and to respect him. We all grieve differently but it sounds like he is VERY comfortable living the way he is. Which is not healthy for himself or those around him. \n\nI'm happy you were able to find happiness again after such a horrendous tragedy. many do not get that chance so I'm thankful you've been able to find it and have it. It was also very kind for your partner to be accepting of your ex husband's feelings too. \n\nBut it sounds like that's all its been. About him. And no one else. He can continue doing this but not at the expense of others. He needs serious help and I hope if he has people around him that they aren't playing into this. It isn't healthy. I hope he puts in effort to heal. \n\nYou've done nothing wrong. If you sold your house he would probably react the same. \n\nAnd its cruel that he doesnt even think about how hard it was for you to pack up the room. It's only been about him.", "NAH. Grief is an awful thing. You did the right thing by reaching out a few times", "Nah ex is being an asshole. Grief isn't an excuse to treat someone like trash. She tried letting him know multiple times but he apparently ghosts her until next time he visits HER house. Then she finally makes the decision to change it up because she's starting a family, he decides to put her down for it and act like he's \"replacing\" their son? That's just cruel. OP did nothing wrong at all anywhere in this story but the ex sure ass hell did.", "She told him she wanted to talk about the room but not that she was planning on redoing it.\n\nI'm going with NAH. OP, you should have spelt it out regardless of his avoiding the issue, and while you don't blame him it's clear he's deep in the guilt that whatever happened was on his watch and he's having a much harder time moving on.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. It's unimaginable.", "The shrine should be so small that it only becomes a cage shortly before you die.  \n\nBecause a large shrine will/should push people away.", "Nope. The Code of Ethics has an expiry clause where if one conversation partner is not responding after several attempts to call or ask for a conversation, they get a message or email telling them what needs to be said and they can like it or lump it.\n\n\"We need to talk\" is not considered a best effort.", "I'm sorry for your loss. There's no such things as a time appropriate timeline. I did the clearing out ASAP but it took a few months for my partner to do the same after his mother passed. I hope you have help and support around you.", "Do it when you're ready. If you tried to walk on a broken leg before it healed enough for walking, you'd make the injury worse.", "NAH. Jesus. I don't know what to say. Just be kind to each other.", "NAH. You need to quickly come to an equitable distribution of yours son\u2019s items.", "A bit, yeah.", "If you specifically said in your messages that you were taking apart the room, then n-t-a, but if you beat around the bush and just said you needed to talk, then y-t-a.  \nAlso, ngl, I\u2019m bothered that you don\u2019t want to give him the \u201ctreasured\u201d items because you have plans for them, as if you having a baby means you have a greater right to your son\u2019s things than he does.", "YTA. You should have said why you wanted to contact him.", "I\u2019m not insulting your ex, but he needs therapy, because he can\u2019t move on.NTA\u2026 there\u2019s no AH here, just a woman who moved on in a healthy manner, and a man who cannot. It\u2019s just tragic.", "NTA. his unavailability is not your issue. You tried to discuss this and he ignored you. I'm so sorry for your loss of both your son and ex husband - poor guy needs help.", "NTA you tried to get in contact with him several times and he didn't answer. That was his chance to see the room a last time. Now he is lashing out because he is still guilt ridden and (my assumption) he feels like he failed his son again.\n\nIt is not your fault that he can't move forward and work through his guilt, anger and grief.\n\nIs it possible to give some things from your late son's room to him?", "He is understandably a walking wound and may never come to terms with what happened but he cannot complain that you didn\u2019t give him a chance when you reached out multiple times. I can see why this hurts him, but you gave him a chance to see the room before packing it up and he never replied, so it\u2019s on him\u2026 I guess soft NTA . He isn\u2019t one for being upset, he is one for ignoring the calls and then saying you should have let him know.", "NAH", "NTA. You went above and beyond to help your ex process his grief. You took the healthy route to heal and continue your life. Life is for the living and keeping a room as a shrine when you have living children who need it isn't a reasonable expectation. You tried to contact your ex, but he didn't respond so you decided what to do next based on your family's needs.", "NTA\u2026you were more than fair to your ex.   You could not keep that room forever.  Yes you live your son and will always remember him, but life moves in as it should.  You are bringing back joy to the room and I am sure your son would want to see the room being used and not closed up.", "NTA. When you feel you are able, select the items you want as keepsakes and send the remaining boxes to your ex-husband. Wishing you all the best!", "NTA - I'm sorry for your loss but surely it would be fair to divided the 'treasured' possessions 50/50.  3 Weeks isn't much time in fairness and you should have addressed the thoney issue of the room long before.  It couldn't remain a shrine.\n\nNobody could replace your child but you are entitled to a life and joy.  Your ex has sentenced himself to this life and only when he judges himself with the debt paid can he move on.\n\nPerhaps you should give him more than the 50% of items because you do have more joy in your life than he does and access to the room on a daily basis .....", "NTA I am not going to talk about the grief side of things, but your husbands behaviour by using his grief to control you. I do not think it was healthy for your ex to keep spending time in the room after the divorce. It enabled him to keep control of both you and the home. For instance, the men who insist on coming into the home to visit the dog they refused to take with them in the split, because they want a way into your life. You again should have stopped the visits once you remarried and again, once you were pregnant you had a third opportunity to shut it down. It is time to cut contact with your ex and has much power is has on the say over your home and entering it.", "I guess I don't understand why you wouldn't tell him vs beating around the bush.", "NTA - but if your ex has a key to your house, I'd change the locks.  He sounds a bit unhinged.", "NTA. Not only can you not be expected to keep a room as a shrine, it\u2019s not healthy. That happens in the movies, but rarely in real life. I hope your ex is able to learn healthier ways to process his grief, as it\u2019s definitely not okay that\u2019s he\u2019s taking it out on you. Congratulations on your little girl.", "I think it could have been handled differently on both parts. On his part, I understand why seeing you pregnant would be triggering for him. He probably didn\u2019t want to burden you with those feelings. On your part, reaching out but not disclosing what you wanted to talk about. Not everyone grieves the same and some people are never the same after a loss, so different reactions are to be expected. I\u2019m going to go with NAH.", "NTA- \n\nIt was unrealistic and selfish of your ex to request that you keep the room available in the first place. \n\n Sure it's nice to be able to come and visit the bedroom when he is feeling Down as a way to be closer to the deceased but that is different then having a room in your house daily that is a reminder to the loss which he left you. \n\nAnd a room that is completely non-functional for you because it is a shrine that you are paying taxes on, heating, cleaning etc. \n\nAnd a promise Made to safe a space doesn't contuine in perpetuity-6 years is a long time. \n\nIf he wants a place to visit, he should have a grave site. Maybe there already is?\n\n\nYou have been more than accommodating and the situation sucks. \n\nBur grief, anger, trauma is not a  great excuse to act out towards other people. \n\n\nIt sucks and we feel for  both of you. But like u said you are allowed to move on and if he hasn't he needs professional help, not a space in your house.\n\nAnd for the situation u reached out a few times. I suppose you could have sent a text after the calls didn't go through, but I understand why you'd want a more personal contact.", "NTA but everyone processes grief differently.  Your ex is having a hard time letting go.  I would let him come over one last time so the 2 of you can split up the items your son left behind and then try and part amicably.  His not being able to move on shouldn\u2019t keep you from doing so.  Very sorry for the loss of your son.", "Not at all. He is the one with issues and imo you have gone out of your way to accommodate him. If you love someone, they are always in your heart and you don\u2019t need a \u201croom\u201d to visit to remember them.", "NTA.  Even if you had reached him, he would not have responded well.  Either way, you DID try.", "NTA. I feel for your ex, he can't get through the guilt and grief  but u tried to contact him. You tried to leave the room alone.", "NTA. Personaly, I would sold that house the moment I would have married again, sadly the less connections left the better for both to truly move on from each other, much sooner.\n\nDivide the things that you want to keep and the ones you will give to him, if you took photos before or during that will help. At this point if get mad, let him. You already did a lot for him", "You are completely right but the person in this post it's not dealing only with grief, it sounds he may be dealing with guilt even when everyone knows it's was not his fault internally he probably blames himself.\n\nDealing with grief is tough, add guilt and becomes another kind of monster", "Nah the ex was definitely one for trying to say she\u2019s replacing but she\u2019s not. She\u2019s moving on and learning to deal with her grief in a healthy manner. He even acts like they\u2019re together if that makes sense. With the \u201cour\u201d child moment he\u2019s grieving a lot of things, but no reason to lash out like he did. He made his decision as did she. The moment he talks like and makes demands like he did puts in the TA territory.", "Oh no, the ex is an asshole. He is angry that she moved on. He\u2019s angry that she has another child and family. He\u2019s totally stuck in being angry at her. I even feel like the past few times of him visiting was to guilt trip her.", "NAH, he's probably upset because  he has more guilt and has not fully grieved.", "If he wanted the treasured items he should have asked for them when he moved out six years earlier.", "She told him it was about the room", "She probably wanted to tell him in person.  But she doesn't owe him any explanation at all.  It is her home.  She was just going to give him a heads up, not ask permission.", "I would suggest that he speak to a therapist specializing in \"complicated grief\" or \"persistent complex bereavement disorder\" because he is ticking a LOT of boxes there.", "\"I sent him a few texts that I wanted to talk to him about something important and tried calling a couple of times.\"\n\n\"Am I the AH for not telling him even when he didn't respond?\"", ">This is not a ~~normal~~ **healthy** reaction to grief .\n\nFTFY.", "\"I said I needed to talk to him about the room but I didn\u2019t explicitly say I was redoing it. I took his ignoring me as not wanting to deal with it.\" - From the comments", "Thanks. I never find changing stories like that very convincing."]}
