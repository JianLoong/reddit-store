I was not home at the time but my ex-husband Rob (37M) was napping at the time our son passed.  I did not blame him because it was a tragic accident and something that could have happened regardless of who was with him. My ex, on the other hand, could not process his guilt and no matter how much therapy he received, he could not move forward.  We amicably split about 4 years ago when he decided that he did not want any more children and I realized I could not just be a bereaved mom but also wanted to be a mom to a child in this life. \n\nI stayed in the home we shared since it was mine before we married but I promised my ex he could continue to come over and spend time in our son\u2019s room because he felt close to Adam when he was in the room.  He continued to do this until I married Sam (39M) about 2 years ago.  We did not live together until then and he was okay with Rob coming over even after we did.  For a while, Rob would stop in once or twice a month but when I became pregnant last year he all but stopped coming.  He may have come once for our son\u2019s birthday. \n\nSo here is the issue, my house has four bedrooms.  I have a stepson (8) who spends 3 nights a week with us so he has a room, we have one, and in August of last year my husband started a remote job so while we originally intended to leave Adam\u2019s room intact, we made the decision to make that the baby\u2019s nursery and the 4th room my husband\u2019s office.  \n\nI delayed our plans to decorate since I wanted my ex to be aware of the plan.  I sent him a few texts that I wanted to talk to him about something important and tried calling a couple of times. I started to believe I might never hear from him again.  I wasn't shocked because he was not thrilled that I was having another baby.  After 3 weeks of no response, we began the really difficult process of packing away my son\u2019s items and redoing the room for my daughter, Sarah, who we welcomed in November. \n\nMy ex reached out after months of no contact and asked if he could stop by on our son\u2019s birthday next week.  I had to tell him that the room was no longer intact and he became irate.  He told me I was the AH for not giving him a chance to see the room one last time. I feel like I tried to reach out a couple of times with no response. He accused me of \u201creplacing\u201d our child with my \u201cnew\u201d family. He is now demanding every single item that belonged to our son because everything is still packed away in the basement. I do have plans for the more treasured items. Am I the AH for not telling him even when he didn't respond?", "created_utc": 1679964201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1246zeu/aita_for_giving_away_my_sons_room_since_he_is_no/", "score": 2901, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do not think it was healthy for your ex to keep spending time in the room after the divorce. It enabled him to keep control of both you and the home.

I think it sounds absolutely commendable that you\u2019ve had the strength to rebuild a life for yourself and been able to put those memories and grief where they belong\u2026within. Having said that, your ex is clearly not in the same place and I find it horrific that people can so casually call him an asshole for not coping with the grief. This is NOT the same as loosing parents. It\u2019s NOT the same as miscarriages.

It was time. You tried to reach out to him and he is the one who didn't answer.

Having a tomb in the middle of your otherwise active lively home isn't good for you or your other kids. I think Adam would be okay with his room having new life breathed into it in the form of his little sister. You can't replace Adam and I'm sure you know that. What you also can't do is live in the past and ignore your other children who are here and need you right now. In the present. I hate it for your ex that he's still living in the past and has clearly in no way recovered from the accident. My heart goes out to him. It goes out to you both. What you figured out that he didn't is that you can't stop living permanently because something unspeakable happened. You took the time you needed to grieve, heal, and grow from it. Your new husband was exceptionally respectful about things where it concerned your ex and clearly has a big heart full of love and compassion. As for his demands-- full stop NO. Adam was not, is not and will never be just HIS child so no he should not be allowed to have every single thing of his. Adam was BOTH of your son. You should BOTH have things of his that are important to you. It would be my suggestion that you decide what you want to keep and let him have the rest. After that I think maybe it's best you cut contact. You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped and he doesn't want to and isn't ready. Someday if he ever overcomes his grief I am sure he will find you when it's appropriate and thank you for being there for so long. No need to announce you're cutting off communication. Doesn't seem like he contacts you much as is. I'd just delete his number and after splitting up Adams things are resolved I wouldn't text him again. I hate that he's hurting but you can't live there in that hurt with him no matter how much you love(d) him. He has to do it on his own from here on out.

Sure, she could have spelled out what the thing was and probably did not because she knew that he would object and why should she have to deal with that argument or the abuse it would likely inspire when this way he clearly screwed himself over.

I moved home shortly after my sister passed and we kept her room intact for about a year until it became unbearable (also covid forcing my parents to both work from home). It was a slow process but a necessary one. Things will need to be divvied up, but you can\u2019t keep a dusty unused room forever. He will always be with you and you can always hug keepsakes from him when you both need to.", "Agreed. If I were OP I'd choose what she wants, then box up the rest and either drop it off with her ex or call him to let him know when he could pick it up. This dude hasn't recovered enough to recognize that OP also loves and grieves their son and isn't going to be reasonable about the division of items.\n\nShe also might want to change her locks, just in case he still has a key and decides to go in and take what he wants.\n\n(Also, NTA.)", "So? If they told him they had something very important to say, he was rude (and foolish) not to respond. \n\nThe poor ex definitely needs professional help (or to meet someone who brings light and joy back to his life) but that is not the OP's problem. She has been incredibly kind and sensitive to his feelings.", "The death of a child is the most powerful form of grief a person can experience though. This is not a black and white situation as you make it out to be. This man isn\u2019t deliberately being an asshole, he\u2019s experienced the worst emotional pain a person can go through, of course he\u2019s not going to react logically, he\u2019s reacting emotionally. What he needs is help and grief counseling.", "He needs a LOT more therapy I think. It\u2019s a terrible way to exist\u2026 with all that guilt and grief.", "I made a small shrine for my husband which consists of his favourite Buddha, his reading glasses and some of his hair ties. It\u2019s in my bedroom and I light a votive at night and blow it out as I go to bed. It\u2019s comforting to me and I always rub the Buddha\u2019s head and say good night to him. It\u2019s a ritual that helps me but doesn\u2019t disturb others.", "It wouldn't be my first move, no, but if leaving a message is better nothing. This is the rare case when his failure to respond is somewhat understable, given how grief stricken he is. OP has every right to move forward and build her family and change her home, but if all she had to do was leave a simple message for her ex about their son's room, I think she should have done that.", "I definitely agree with that part and I\u2019m sure everyone else is too.

Most things were just garbage and most of what could have been good had to get thrown out because of mold. Got a lot of cool nicknacks from what was left over though. Got my dad's old pog collection and some Alaskan stuff that came from another family member. Cleaning his mess of a life made it harder to actually miss him. Thank God his debt wasn't terrible, but he did choose to buy fishing gear instead of paying that years property taxes.", "Everyone acts as if he knew what the chance was to act on it, though.

You do need to split up the stuff and give your ex some of Adams things.", "NTA but grief has really done a number on him", "You should have texted exactly what you were going to do. Then he would have known or at least may have known. Did you take pictures for him of the room? At least that way he would have that. Let him go through the stuff and take what he wants. I am curious why you made the room your new babies. I don\u2019t think I could have done that. Too many memories of a child lost. I would have made it your new husbands office instead.", "NTA - he is processing grief still. Gosh I hope he\u2019s in therapy. You were the safest person for him to lash out in since this makes him so incredibly sad. No fault for anyone just such a sad situation.

Would that not be acceptable either? Did you have to stay in that house, with that room kept untouched for your ex husband to visit forever?? And as for the belongings, you are Adams mom, if he wants some things to remember his son by then of course he should have some. But he can't just stamp his feet and decide after all this time he wants everything.\nIt sounds like he would only be happy if you had stayed childless with Adams room intact until the day you died. Surely he can see that's unreasonable?\nYou contacted him, he ignored the message, he's gaslighting you because his own stubborness has made him miss out on something. But you can't let him control your life.  You moved on, and its time he moved on too.", "Sweetheart, you were trying to help him but his grief has just taken over. I think you need to take a step back and set some firm boundaries. A good therapist can help you through this. You can't save him from himself.\n\nYou don't deserve to be treated this way. You deserve to live your life and to celebrate the time you had with your son. You deserve to move forward.\n\nI am so sorry for all that you have endured.

I will look into it.", "I worry about where he is when he gets a message and how he will respond. On the phone I can tell and then get him help if needed. I understand why people think I should have just told him but I would just prefer to not have something happen to him. I can live with his anger toward me, I couldn\u2019t live with myself if something happened to him because I sent a text while he was driving or something.", "I guess it\u2019s personal. I find the room to be a really comforting spot. An office is cold and would have my husbands stuff all over it. For practical reasons the office is quite small and eventually we would either have to move my daughter into the room or give her my stepsons room when he is ready to move out.", "No, I wanted him to hear it from me and I wanted to gauge his reaction to make sure he was safe after he found out. It was angry this time but if he read it while driving for example, it could have been any other emotion and he could have gotten hurt or hurt someone.", "This could not be truer. I had a wall of all of my dead daughters stuff. Pictures, clothing, literal angel wings. I would stare at it for hours, completely blanking out and breaking my own heart over and over again. \n\nThat shrine was a never-ending reminder of what I had lost and how broken I'd become. The guilt consumed me, and the senseless loss of her life engulfed my soul.  The damage I did to my psyche reverberated through my entire life. \nThe thing was, I could not build a life around my grief with the constant reminder of the trauma we endured. It was always there, a reminder of the next devastating loss waiting just around the next corner. \n\nI did not rebuild my life until I stopped punishing myself for her death. I couldn't stop punishing myself until I stopped dowsing myself in the trauma of her death. \n\nLastly, for OP, I hope your husband understands that carving a life out of such a horrible loss does not mean his love for his son subsided. It does not mean he will ever get over the loss. It means that he has found a way to honor a life lost too soon by living the best one of his own. \nI am so sorry for both of you. From one bereaved mother to another.", "Why was it OP's responsibility to spell it out?  It's her house and she was nice enough to allow this to go on for some time.  She owes him absolutely nothing.  I would pack up what I wanted him to have ship it to him, change my locks and be done with him.  His grief and how he handles it is not her responsibility.  OP NTA", "His reactions strike me as scary. He desperately needs a lot of therapy. I would personally be worried about his aggressiveness, or at the very least about him adding unnecessary stress during what should be a magical time with your baby girl. Do you think it might be worth going no contact with him? It seems like maybe staying in touch isn't good for either of you. If you feel generous, send him a few treasured mementos, keep the rest, and block him.", "He's angry that you are figuring out how to move on when he can't.", "That makes sense.  You were trying to take his feelings into consideration.  Again, I still think you should have told him directly, but you can\u2019t change that now.  I think you try and move forward by letting him take what is important to him and encouraging him to get help processing his incredible grief.", "I feel YTA for not being specific in your messages.  If you did, I feel he would have contacted you sooner.", "It took me a few weeks to clean out her bedroom after she passed but a year to clean out the whole house. That was super tough.

That's just common sense. I'd try to approach things delicately to start with, but if someone ignored me then I'd just fulfill my obligation to inform them so I can get on with things.", "Yep. He probably knows deep down that he's not in a healthy place, but seeing someone who's healing shines a light on how he's stuck. Easier to go on the attack and say that moving on is heartlessness.", ">Do you think it might be worth going no contact with him? \n\nI think sometimes life is just messy and I understand going no contact.  At the same time, we have a connection and a bond that I will never share with anyone, including my husband. Going through our son's items without him feels weird so I will wait until I feel better about it or he comes around.", "Exactly \n\nPlusmy ex hated my shrine to our dead son even after we stopped being together that hurt me a lot when he\u2019d mock it.", "NTA He had an unhealthy attachment to a room in your home that became a shrine for him to worship at. He dropped off the radar for whatever reason, and you tried to contact him. He knew. That's probably why he refused to acknowledge your texts. By not acknowledging them, he probably hoped to keep things in limbo and the shrine intact for when he was ready to worship at it again. Everyone grieves differently, and it takes the time it takes. That doesn't mean he gets to hold your life hostage to his grief.", "NTA.", "NTA.  You tried.  Keeping that room empty won't make your son come stay in it.  He's gone.  I know it has to be absolutely heartbreaking for your ex, but his grief is not your responsibility.

Obviously your ex is still having difficulty but he ignored your attempts for contact. You did nothing wrong. He doesn't get to demand everything. The two of you do need to decide how to divide these things. If he won't be reasonable with you, go through it and take the few things you want to keep and box the rest up for him to pick up. I'm sorry for the loss both of you have experienced.", "NAH. I have 4 kids and can't imagine losing one so I am very sorry to hear that you did. You are NTA because you made a step to move forward. He's also NTA because he is obviously still dealing with grief and that can cause some to act irrationally or angrily especially to change. I have no idea why he didn't respond to you contacting him and you certainly made the effort.", "NTA. This is difficult for everyone, but they have to move on. You would be doing him a favor if you denied him all of your son's things other than a few keepsakes, He needs to move on also.", "NTA. It is not your fault that he did not respond when you reached out to him. And no. He does not have the right to have everything that was your Adam's as Adam was also your son.

At this point, the best thing for them/the ex to do is to go through the child's things and choose what to give away and what to keep. A toy or blanket or outfit or a combination thereof can help the ex remember their child without preventing OP from also healing.", "Keeping a child who has passed away's bedroom as it is is normal and there is no timeline for grief. Outsiders looking in don't understand that it's not a \"shrine\" or a \"cage\" but those items the child owned are a way of feeling close to them and proof they existed in a world that seems to forget and move on very quickly. It is very difficult to throw out or store things for a long time. \n\nOP is NTA but her ex has every right to be upset. Bereaved parents never move on and I can tell you as a bereaved parent myself if I was in his position I would've been extremely upset too. Also babies and families with kids can be extremely triggering for those who have lost babies/small children. Its no surprise the ex has been distant. When my sister was having a baby after I'd lost my own I couldn't bare to know anything about it for awhile. Luckily my sister was understanding and patient.\n\nHe's not right to demand all of their baby's things but he is justified in being hurt and upset. It's the grief. I think he and OP need to sit down and have a good long chat to clear the air.", "I mean he works from home with an infant. Babies are not exactly quiet.  He literally does not have an office to go to on this side of the country so the office was absolutely a necessity.", "Somehow my comment posted to the wrong post bwhahahah", "And, they have to waste this space for years so he can drop by 2x per year for a few hours? It was time, and he needed to stop thinking he had a say in your life. If he keeps it up, you may have no choice but to go no contact.

It's in the wrong order. A child isn't supposed to die before their parent.  Bereaved parents go on parenting and protecting their child for the rest of their lives. They never stop grieving. There is no moving on - your world gradually just rebuilds around your grief. This includes keeping their child's things safe and often yes on display. You don't stop loving or being proud of your child once they've passed. You want to share them with the world just as much as any other living child. You want to keep their memory alive and present. \n\nDescribing this behaviour as unhealthy or as \"keeping a shrine\" in a negative tone is very ignorant.", "They had a child who died.  They amicably split because that life shattering event changed their relationship forever. In her post and several comments she never said \u201cthe shrine\u201d was a burden on her and her family, and in fact she\u2019s always been super kind about allowing him access to the space.  I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a bad person.  She in no way had to keep it forever, but knowing what it meant to her ex, I wish she had been explicit about what she was intending, not just \u201cneed to talk to you.\u2019 Her being able to move on is probably so incredibly painful for him as he\u2019s clearly not able to get past his grief.  Hopefully he can get some help and find a way forward.", "Yeah, I get the thought process, and there really are no \"good\" options, but I think just giving him the chance to mentally prepare himself (even if he saw the text at a bad time) would be better than him finding out it was already done and gone at the best of times. \n\nBut again, this is the very gentlest of ESHes. Y'all both have gone through and are going through something no one should ever have to experience. That kind of grief can mess with your ability to think clearly at times, in addition to affecting everyone differently (so it's hard to predict someone else's best means of processing).

It's just a terrible situation all around.", "> Of course accidents happen and sometimes there is fault- but acting like this is his fault and saying he isn\u2019t a man is just toxic, cruel and wrong.\n\nHow can you say \u201cof course\u201d there is fault, but saying it\u2019s his fault is \u201ctoxic, cruel and wrong\u201d in the same sentence? \n\nYou keep denying it\u2019s his fault, and resting on it being SIDS when that isn\u2019t something that came from OP."]}
