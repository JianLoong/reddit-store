I was not home at the time but my ex-husband Rob (37M) was napping at the time our son passed.  I did not blame him because it was a tragic accident and something that could have happened regardless of who was with him. My ex, on the other hand, could not process his guilt and no matter how much therapy he received, he could not move forward.  We amicably split about 4 years ago when he decided that he did not want any more children and I realized I could not just be a bereaved mom but also wanted to be a mom to a child in this life. \n\nI stayed in the home we shared since it was mine before we married but I promised my ex he could continue to come over and spend time in our son\u2019s room because he felt close to Adam when he was in the room.  He continued to do this until I married Sam (39M) about 2 years ago.  We did not live together until then and he was okay with Rob coming over even after we did.  For a while, Rob would stop in once or twice a month but when I became pregnant last year he all but stopped coming.  He may have come once for our son\u2019s birthday. \n\nSo here is the issue, my house has four bedrooms.  I have a stepson (8) who spends 3 nights a week with us so he has a room, we have one, and in August of last year my husband started a remote job so while we originally intended to leave Adam\u2019s room intact, we made the decision to make that the baby\u2019s nursery and the 4th room my husband\u2019s office.  \n\nI delayed our plans to decorate since I wanted my ex to be aware of the plan.  I sent him a few texts that I wanted to talk to him about something important and tried calling a couple of times. I started to believe I might never hear from him again.  I wasn't shocked because he was not thrilled that I was having another baby.  After 3 weeks of no response, we began the really difficult process of packing away my son\u2019s items and redoing the room for my daughter, Sarah, who we welcomed in November. \n\nMy ex reached out after months of no contact and asked if he could stop by on our son\u2019s birthday next week.  I had to tell him that the room was no longer intact and he became irate.  He told me I was the AH for not giving him a chance to see the room one last time. I feel like I tried to reach out a couple of times with no response. He accused me of \u201creplacing\u201d our child with my \u201cnew\u201d family. He is now demanding every single item that belonged to our son because everything is still packed away in the basement. I do have plans for the more treasured items. Am I the AH for not telling him even when he didn't respond?", "created_utc": 1679964201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1246zeu/aita_for_giving_away_my_sons_room_since_he_is_no/", "score": 486, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm very sorry for your loss, and I hope you have a happy future with your family.", "NTA\n\nYou have kept the room and have given him a place to grieve for a long time. You have put the effort in trying to reach out to him about your decision to move forward with your life and the situation in the house. No, you are definitely not the asshole.\n\nI can't say anything about your ex, I have no experience with these things, but it sounds unhealthy with what he's doing to himself. Perhaps he needs the removal of Adam's for him to stop clinging and move on(?)", "NTA.  You've been more than accommodating. You and your new husband have graciously allowed him to come into your home and grieve for years.\n\nBut you need to move forward with your future and family. He's deeply rooted in his grief and the past. This might be what he needed to start moving forward.", "NTA\n\nHe needs therapy and lots of it. Honestly, it sounds like he was lucky he didn\u2019t end up charged with negligence or worse, if he was asleep with a one year old in the house when something happened to the child. He needs to move on.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo no contact with him?", "Nta . You tried multiple times to reach out and it's not like you blindsided him he clearly knew eventually now that you remarried there might have been a possibility of getting pregnant again", "NTA\n\nI am so incredibly sorry for your loss. \n\nYou did all you could to reach out to him and to respect him. We all grieve differently but it sounds like he is VERY comfortable living the way he is. Which is not healthy for himself or those around him. \n\nI'm happy you were able to find happiness again after such a horrendous tragedy. many do not get that chance so I'm thankful you've been able to find it and have it. It was also very kind for your partner to be accepting of your ex husband's feelings too. \n\nBut it sounds like that's all its been. About him. And no one else. He can continue doing this but not at the expense of others. He needs serious help and I hope if he has people around him that they aren't playing into this. It isn't healthy. I hope he puts in effort to heal. \n\nYou've done nothing wrong. If you sold your house he would probably react the same. \n\nAnd its cruel that he doesnt even think about how hard it was for you to pack up the room. It's only been about him.", "NAH. Grief is an awful thing. You did the right thing by reaching out a few times", "Nah ex is being an asshole. Grief isn't an excuse to treat someone like trash. She tried letting him know multiple times but he apparently ghosts her until next time he visits HER house. Then she finally makes the decision to change it up because she's starting a family, he decides to put her down for it and act like he's \"replacing\" their son? That's just cruel. OP did nothing wrong at all anywhere in this story but the ex sure ass hell did.", "She told him she wanted to talk about the room but not that she was planning on redoing it.\n\nI'm going with NAH. OP, you should have spelt it out regardless of his avoiding the issue, and while you don't blame him it's clear he's deep in the guilt that whatever happened was on his watch and he's having a much harder time moving on.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. It's unimaginable.", "The shrine should be so small that it only becomes a cage shortly before you die.  \n\nBecause a large shrine will/should push people away.", "Nope. The Code of Ethics has an expiry clause where if one conversation partner is not responding after several attempts to call or ask for a conversation, they get a message or email telling them what needs to be said and they can like it or lump it.\n\n\"We need to talk\" is not considered a best effort.", "I'm sorry for your loss. There's no such things as a time appropriate timeline. I did the clearing out ASAP but it took a few months for my partner to do the same after his mother passed. I hope you have help and support around you.", "Do it when you're ready. If you tried to walk on a broken leg before it healed enough for walking, you'd make the injury worse."]}
