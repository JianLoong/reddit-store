I was not home at the time but my ex-husband Rob (37M) was napping at the time our son passed.  I did not blame him because it was a tragic accident and something that could have happened regardless of who was with him. My ex, on the other hand, could not process his guilt and no matter how much therapy he received, he could not move forward.  We amicably split about 4 years ago when he decided that he did not want any more children and I realized I could not just be a bereaved mom but also wanted to be a mom to a child in this life. \n\nI stayed in the home we shared since it was mine before we married but I promised my ex he could continue to come over and spend time in our son\u2019s room because he felt close to Adam when he was in the room.  He continued to do this until I married Sam (39M) about 2 years ago.  We did not live together until then and he was okay with Rob coming over even after we did.  For a while, Rob would stop in once or twice a month but when I became pregnant last year he all but stopped coming.  He may have come once for our son\u2019s birthday. \n\nSo here is the issue, my house has four bedrooms.  I have a stepson (8) who spends 3 nights a week with us so he has a room, we have one, and in August of last year my husband started a remote job so while we originally intended to leave Adam\u2019s room intact, we made the decision to make that the baby\u2019s nursery and the 4th room my husband\u2019s office.  \n\nI delayed our plans to decorate since I wanted my ex to be aware of the plan.  I sent him a few texts that I wanted to talk to him about something important and tried calling a couple of times. I started to believe I might never hear from him again.  I wasn't shocked because he was not thrilled that I was having another baby.  After 3 weeks of no response, we began the really difficult process of packing away my son\u2019s items and redoing the room for my daughter, Sarah, who we welcomed in November. \n\nMy ex reached out after months of no contact and asked if he could stop by on our son\u2019s birthday next week.  I had to tell him that the room was no longer intact and he became irate.  He told me I was the AH for not giving him a chance to see the room one last time. I feel like I tried to reach out a couple of times with no response. He accused me of \u201creplacing\u201d our child with my \u201cnew\u201d family. He is now demanding every single item that belonged to our son because everything is still packed away in the basement. I do have plans for the more treasured items. Am I the AH for not telling him even when he didn't respond?", "created_utc": 1679964201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1246zeu/aita_for_giving_away_my_sons_room_since_he_is_no/", "score": 2118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do not think it was healthy for your ex to keep spending time in the room after the divorce. It enabled him to keep control of both you and the home.

I think it sounds absolutely commendable that you\u2019ve had the strength to rebuild a life for yourself and been able to put those memories and grief where they belong\u2026within. Having said that, your ex is clearly not in the same place and I find it horrific that people can so casually call him an asshole for not coping with the grief. This is NOT the same as loosing parents. It\u2019s NOT the same as miscarriages.

It was time. You tried to reach out to him and he is the one who didn't answer.

Having a tomb in the middle of your otherwise active lively home isn't good for you or your other kids. I think Adam would be okay with his room having new life breathed into it in the form of his little sister. You can't replace Adam and I'm sure you know that. What you also can't do is live in the past and ignore your other children who are here and need you right now. In the present. I hate it for your ex that he's still living in the past and has clearly in no way recovered from the accident. My heart goes out to him. It goes out to you both. What you figured out that he didn't is that you can't stop living permanently because something unspeakable happened. You took the time you needed to grieve, heal, and grow from it. Your new husband was exceptionally respectful about things where it concerned your ex and clearly has a big heart full of love and compassion. As for his demands-- full stop NO. Adam was not, is not and will never be just HIS child so no he should not be allowed to have every single thing of his. Adam was BOTH of your son. You should BOTH have things of his that are important to you. It would be my suggestion that you decide what you want to keep and let him have the rest. After that I think maybe it's best you cut contact. You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped and he doesn't want to and isn't ready. Someday if he ever overcomes his grief I am sure he will find you when it's appropriate and thank you for being there for so long. No need to announce you're cutting off communication. Doesn't seem like he contacts you much as is. I'd just delete his number and after splitting up Adams things are resolved I wouldn't text him again. I hate that he's hurting but you can't live there in that hurt with him no matter how much you love(d) him. He has to do it on his own from here on out.

Sure, she could have spelled out what the thing was and probably did not because she knew that he would object and why should she have to deal with that argument or the abuse it would likely inspire when this way he clearly screwed himself over.

Cleaning out her bedroom was cathartic, and I had more happy memories  than bad from touching her things and remembering where they had come from.", "Sometimes it helps to have someone who is close enough that they also loved the person who passed, but not as close as a child.  When my MIL passed I did her bedroom and the more personal spaces to spare my husband and his siblings.  It was tough for me but not as tough as it would have been for them.  And I was close enough to recognize the items that would be really important to save for them.", "My great grandma kept a \u201cforever shrine\u201d in her house and it was really creepy\u2026 Her daughter, my dad\u2019s mom, passed tragically in 1964- her bedroom in great grandma\u2019s house was exactly as she\u2019d left it the morning she died. I was the person to clean that room out, just before my dad passed, because I was the only one who wasn\u2019t afraid to go in there\u2026 her hairbrush still had hair on it, her lipstick and perfume were there, her last worn clothes and underwear hadn\u2019t been washed and was lying on top of her laundry basket\u2026 CREEPY.  When I say we have a family ghost, it\u2019s very literal. \n\nOP, you did the right thing. Your ex is drowning in his grief, and angry at you for moving on with life- that\u2019s not fair. Your lost baby should be a precious, bittersweet memory which you celebrate at different moments- not a family ghost that all the living become fearful of\u2026 Put up some pictures, display some of his items, but- keeping a shrine like that causes the whole family to live in extended grief.", "I agree he's being unreasonable. Grief does intense things to a lot of people.", "Yes being explicit would be best, can't claim miscommunication that way", "You have a very arbitrary definition for \u201cman\u201d.", "Yes, but OP is also grieving so shouldn\u2019t have to deal with his selfishness and verbal and emotional abuse.", "Why do you normally roll your eyes at therapy recommendations?", "I never said she had to. I said she could have given him a better heads up", "I did not say she should have to deal with it. I just didn't call a man who blames himself for the death of his child a selfish asshole.", "Selfish assholes can have bad stuff happen to them, just like nice people. It doesn\u2019t mean they become above criticism.", "NAH yes your ex isn't correct for how he treated you but I can't call a grieving parent an asshole. He was there when your child together died. I can see how he hasn't be able to move on. Your not wrong for changing the room for your new child.", "NTA. You tried to reach him but he refused to respond. It\u2019s your home. You\u2019re not erasing or replacing Adam. Nothing can do that. He is not his bedroom. He is not his stuff. He is gone from this world and no amount of stuff can fix that. It\u2019s tragic but it\u2019s true. Sarah and your stepson also deserve space and love. \n\nYou also don\u2019t owe your ex *all* Adam\u2019s stuff.

Did you explicitly say what was happening to the room at all in the texts or did you just say \"we need to talk about something\"?

Everyone grieves differently and processes things in their own way. You tried to reach out and he never replied. It was your house before him and you kept it after him, so you are well within your rights to redecorate and use the rooms as you see fit. \n\nWhen we lost our boys all their stuff was packed up pretty quickly. Especially medical equipment & supplies that had to be sent back and used supplies that needed thrown away. Some of the stuff was donated to other special needs families that could use it. I took a lot of heat from all sides about not keeping their things where they were (except dirty laundry and supplies). \n\nYou kept his room as it was for a long time to allow him to sit with your son and feel present amd connected with him. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss. This is a club that no one wants to join and we can never get out of.", "NTA you gave him more than enough time to come see it, he ignored you for months and months. In my opinion you were nice enough to even address it with him, as it is your home. I\u2019d say give him some things and move on from him. He\u2019s holding himself back in life over this and it\u2019s not healthy for anyone. Sorry for you loss, you didn\u2019t replace him, he will always be your child, but you\u2019re allowed to have more than one!", "NAH, meet up and divide your sons things and let him take what he wants.", "NAH. Grief is a shit show. OP you handled things with the utmost respect. I\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your babe but I hope you\u2019re able to find new joy and ways to honor your son through your growing family.", "NTA.\n\nThis has to have been incredibly difficult for you and your ex, but... the new baby's got to sleep someplace.  This is the most logical spot, and keeping it as a shrine for the every-six-to-twelve-months your ex would like to visit is just not practical or healthy.  You communicated this, it sounds like, well in advance and got no response, meaning you did your due diligence.", "So I\u2019m gonna go with NTA because you eventually have to do what is best for you but I think you definitely could have handled this situation better. You were very vague in stating your intentions with his room. Instead of just saying \u201cwe need to talk about something important\u201d you could have been straight up with him. You guys are exes so you don\u2019t know what each other\u2019s day to day or even week to week looks like. He could have had something important/serious going on that needed to be taken care of right away. If he had known what your true intentions were from the get, he could have made time to come look and reminisce just one more time or even taken pictures of the room to look back on. I understand both sides.", "NTA.  It's called healing.  Bless you and your family.", "NTA you cant hide forever.  If he wanted any items he would have asked by now.  You will never forget but Im glad you are remembering to live.", "NTA. A difficult situation but I don\u2019t think you are in the wrong for trying to rebuild your life", "NTA\n\nYou did your best to contact him and give him a heads up. Give him a few special items and keep some for yourself.\n\nI\u2019m terribly sorry for your loss", "NTA. You tried to reach your ex and he didn't respond. That is not your issue. And now he is being abusive because you have chosen to move on with life, something he seems unable to do. He needs serious counseling. I would pick out their treasured items you want to keep and let him have the rest of your son's belongings but, please, do not feel the need to give him everything. Because you chose to remarry and have children, does not mean you have forgotten or replaced your son.", "NTA literally the worst thing that can ever happen to you happened.  But life doesn't stop moving and eventually you will end up on one of two paths, the one you're on where you learn to move past the grief or the other one where you dwell in it until it consumes you as your ex has.  Having a new baby is wonderful, something to be celebrated without condition.  Nothing about it detracts from or replaces Adam in any way.  Brutal though it may be a level of practicality also needs to be observed, I assume like most people you don't have endless resources to buy extra space either in a new house or building an extension etc.  Eventually the room was going to need to be used again and there are other ways of remembering Adam.  My aunt and her children light a candle on my cousin's birthday every year, even 25 years later.  My friend's mother takes the anniversary of her daughter's death as a quiet day to remember her.  You have been more than accommodating to your ex.  The fact that this has broken him isn't your fault, nor is the fact that he can't process this properly.  The viciousness of his response is unfortunate is something you will hopefully be able to just ignore.", "NTA... both of you. I understand that it was a shock to him, that he didnt had that last moment in the room. Or that you haven't maybe texted him the clear intention of reusing the room so that he might have answeard. BUT thats something he also blames himself for, he shouldnt have ignored you. And he knows that now. And you had every right to not tell him if he doenst respond back to you. So you are clearly NTA, but i also feel like your EX is NTA also..  this whole situation is just really fucked up and i wish the very best to both of you.", "Nta\n\nYou did your due diligence by contacting him and trying to reach out.  He really needs therapy, and your home belongs to you.  You should let the ex have some of Adams things, though.  But all of it is way too dramatic and selfish of him to demand.", "NTA, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for your ex to come into your home anymore after his reaction toward your \u201cnew family.\u201d", "NTA. I feel for both of you. I can't imagine the pain that both of you have suffered. But you did not replace your son. You tried to notify him and he didn't respond. He's allowed to distance himself from you if that is what he wants, but he can't get mad at you when he is the one who made that choice to not respond to you.", "NAH. He's clearly going based off of grief, and he isn't thinking rationally at all.", "NTA- he had more then enough time to contact you  in regards to this. He was aware you were expecting so this was probably why he was avoiding you. He is still mad at himself and is lashing out at you.", "NTA - you did everything you could, you were generous with your time, and your space, and access to your home. He had to reasonable expectation that you would maintain this arrangement, but I understand why he's upset. He's just going to have to get over it. Congratulations on your new baby, and best of luck living your life to the fullest!", "Ntah.  Your son will always be alive in your heart and soul.  If your ex needs some keepsakes then let him have some but keep some for yourself no matter where you store them.  Life is meant to be lived and lived well no matter who passes.  I\u2019m sorry for you loss.", "NTA the AH BUUUUUUUUTTTTTTT. You said you texted and called saying you needed to talk about something important. In any of those messages you could have stated your intention for the room and said you wanted to discuss it. THAT would have gotten a call back. You do have to move on, life is movement and change.", "Nta you tried to reach out and he didn\u2019t respond, it\u2019s a terrible situation but you have moved on and ultimately it is your home so you should be able to do whatever you\u2019d like with it", "NTA. Firstly, you have him multiple chances to respond and come see the room prior to y\u2019all doing anything to it, and secondly, it isn\u2019t necessary to have a permanent shrine to loss in your home. And thirdly, it\u2019s your home, not your ex\u2019s home, so at the end of the day they\u2019ve got no say in it anyway. Grief sucks, it\u2019s horrible what happened, but part of living is continuing living and dealing with the losses we experience. Your ex needs to do that.", "This is so sad but you can\u2019t keep your family on hold indefinitely. Definitely NTA. Your ex needs to move forward too.", "NTA.", "I'm so sorry for your loss.

Not on purposes. We all understand accidents. Yet for him this grief is tearing him apart. All those what if's he thinks about likely daily.  This isn't him being angry about you having found a place where that crushing grief has finally turned into the dull ache, you'll always carry for the love you had for a tiny person gone too soon.\n\nThis is him unable to forgive himself, for needing to return to the poisoned well of self-flagellation and for being not only being unwilling to move on, but unable and his cycle of self-destruction. I am so sorry for your loss and so proud that you're able to step forward and give that same love to another child. You're a strong, loving, caring and very considerate person. As is your husband for showing your ex-husband compassion in the wake of such a tragic event.\n\nYou tried and your compassion to speak to him rather than a cold text says a lot to me. Give him time to process his fresh grief then sit down with your husband present and split those things which carry good memories. Be kind, be loving but don't blame yourself for finally allowing yourself to be happy again. That's a huge step and one of the hardest with grief. You're a good person.

You should try and meet with him with a list of the items and come to an agreement of who gets what. \n\nBest of luck, and congrats on your healing journey so far.", "NTA - you have every right to move forward however you could have told him through text. Completely keeping it from him is kind of messed up.", "I have an idea that might be able to soothe him. See if you can get a custom made miniature room made that looked exactly like your son's room. Something that he can display on a table and take with him wherever he goes.", "Agreed..and maybe (probably more of a once again) encourage your ex to seek therapy... he is obviously still guilt ridden and stuck on that moment your son died", "Agreed. I think OP also doesn\u2019t mean to keep all their late son\u2019s belongings to herself, considering how much she has been understanding so far I can\u2019t imagine she won\u2019t be willing to share some of the belongings with her ex. But he isn\u2019t entitled to everything, nor can he expect them to keep an empty room intact forever. I can\u2019t begin to imagine the pain of losing a child but having that \u201cshrine\u201d does not seem healthy. \n\nGonna say soft NTA because I don\u2019t feel like OP\u2019s ex is a full blown ahole, he clearly just needs tons more of therapy. I hope he will heal eventually.", "But she didn't let him know of his plan, she reached out to discuss. \nI agree NTA but that point needs to be accurate.
