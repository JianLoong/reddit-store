Although if the books were stacked, it's you're the asshole.\n\n>My sister was on her phone the whole time with her AirPods in, and I was irked, but just ignored it.\n\nWho fucking cares? What does it have to do with you? \n\nIf you were going out of your way for something that clearly would've been picked up together normally, then that's a dick move. It's not your job to police your sisters time though.", "YTA the polite thing to do and the obvious thing to do was to collect both of your books. You paid...why would she think you wouldn't bring the books as well. You could have picked it up from the counter and pass it to her...signifying the transaction was complete. Your dad was right. What you did wasn't right and your sister needs to be more selfaware. Its dangerous to be in your phone and not pay attention to your surroundings.", "NTA how is your sister supposed to learn otherwise?", "I have to agree big with this. I used to pick up my sister at her college, and I lost track of how many times I had to slam on my brakes because some college student was too busy looking down at their phone while walking across a major street.", "It seems her sister does this a lot. If the dad even said the sister should have been paying attention, I'm going to bet the sister ignored the family a lot because of her phone or forgets things to the point where its beyond annoying.\n\nEDIT: HAHAHAH!! HE DELETED ALL HIS REPLIES \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "I agree with you. It was a dick move.", "If someone pays then the other person should be thanking them and offering to help out, not completely ignore their presence and expect to get everything hand delivered for me. OP did nothing harmless, just gave her an opportunity to notice for herself, and then spoke up before it became an issue. This is some pretty calm boundary setting. OP would've been nice to confront sister, but nobody is entitled to expect everyone to do everything for them while they have fun and then get mad when people don't baby them.", "None of that changes that it's not her job to parent her sister or police her behavior. Doesn't even seem like the dad gives a shit she's on the phone in and of itself, just that she needs to be more attentive to not miss things.", "It doesn't if she does this alot. what he didn't wasn't right. It wasn't nice nor polite.", "If someone purchases something for you do you just reach out and grab it off the counter? Or, do you wait until the person hands it to you? Or signals for you to take them?\n\nMaybe this is a cultural difference type of situation.....hmmm... in my mind it's bad manners to take it from the counter during or after a transaction if someone is buying for you. You wait for them to pass it to you.  Older brother buys younger sister books. The books are in front of him. He is incharge of the transaction taking place. The books are more so in his possession. While she stands off in her phone obviously not focusing on the transaction. Why would he just take his own books and leave hers there? It is like he abandoned her books. The assumption that he would pick up all books after the transaction makes the most sense. Thats just what people do. If he didn't want to he would simple tell her come for the books before moving off from the counter or passing them off to her before she walks off to leave the store. \"Here take your books\" Then she should say \"thank you\" That would be the opportune time to give thanks for buying. \n\nMaybe she already said thank you  or as sibling they don't say thank you to each other but show their thanks in different ways.", "But it IS her job to carry the sisters shit cause she\u2019s on her phone? No! Guess she\u2019s NTA for not being her sisters maid then hey?", "It's annoying when people are meant to be interacting with you but won't put down their phone. And if parents aren't going to, it often falls on the siblings. It's called \"Parentification\"\n\nMaybe you've never experienced it, but it happens a lot.", "Ahh the classic black and white all or nothing thinking of AITA judges. Off you go.", "Why would the sister be \"meant to be interacting with\" her for a trip to the book store to buy a school book? \n\n>It's called \"Parentification\"\n\nIt's called parentification when the kids actually have to be parents. It's called being an overbearing sibling when they just choose to.\n\nThe fact that parentification exists and is a fucked up thing to do to kids has nothing to do with what is described here.", "Well. The AITA\u2026.. is\u2026. AITA for not picking up my sisters book and carrying it for her because she was buried in her phone\u2026.. so yes?\n\nYou literally tired to vote Y T A because \u201cit\u2019s not your job to police your sisters behaviour\u201d\n\nSo how exactly. Is op the AH for not picking up her sisters book? Go ahead.\n\nAnd the block. Classic. \ud83d\ude02 no clue WHAT the response was but I\u2019m assuming more nonsense about how it\u2019s not OPs job to correct her sisters behaviour but IS her job to be her sisters care taker \ud83e\udd14", "The situation called for both siblings to pay attention to their surroundings. The sister was clearly not. That's annoying to the OP, and clearly they knew something was going to happen the moment their sister put the headphones in and disconnected from the world. \n\nAnd it did, the OP doesn't need to make sure their siblings remember things because that's not their job but if the dad thinks so and reprimanded them for it, it's clear that they've been doing shit for their sister for ages. Being a third parent.", "Did you not even read my original post? What was the judgment in my original post? Go ahead and quote it. Quote the part of my post that the bot will grab, my actual judgment. \n\nI literally DIDN'T try to vote that. You literally are a liar or incompetent.\n\n>So how exactly. Is op the AH for not picking up her sisters book? Go ahead.\n\nTry reading the fucking comment. I explained the reasoning already.\n\nYou know what nevermind. I'm not wasting more time with you, so I'll show how dumb your argument is myself and then be done with you.\n\n>NTA\n\nThat was my vote. Pretty fucking clearly not \"trying\" to vote Y T A, is it? I successfully voted and it wasn't Y T A.", "So you're conceding your previous argument about \"interacting with\" was a distraction and bad argument?\n\nWe have a one sided story from a kid who *obviously* is dealing with pent up sibling frustrations. You think there's no chance the dad would've noticed? That maybe OP's description is a little biased? Maybe you've never experienced it, but it happens a lot that siblings fight and get petty over dumb shit.\n\nThe dad **did parent**. So the assumption lil miss \"omg she's on tiktok, I'll teach her\" is just an altruist being forced to parent is just so fuckin baseless and naive."]}
