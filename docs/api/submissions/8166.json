The best thing I think you can do here is to block your mom so she doesn't know what you're posting. It will make both of you happier.", "NTA. I understand the cultural strain this is putting you in because it\u2019s clear your mom is more \u201cold school\u201d in her religious beliefs but you\u2019re a married adult and it\u2019s Instagram not only fans.", "\"i feel overwhelmed with the unnecessary drama\"\n\nIt wasn't a reasonable request.\n\n\"Stop doing this harmless activity that you enjoy because my step siblings  might see it!\"\n\nF that noise.

It sounds like there is a generational/cultural divide between you and your mom. It\u2019s intense that she has already pulled the \u201cdon\u2019t visit me anymore!\u201d card over this issue; that must be painful! You have a lot of soul searching to do to decide what matters most to you going forward; what boundaries you need to feel happy. Definitely NTA. Good luck!", "NTA.

She has no say in what you do or post on social media. Just let it play out. I'm sure she will break before you as she will want to be part of your life if for no other reason than to try and dictate how you live it. She sounds too controlling to give you the silent treatment for too long. If she doesn't talk to you then how can she tell you how to live your life?", "NTA. I don\u2019t see how you posting pictures on Instagram is an issue. That\u2019s a weird hill that she\u2019s willing to die on. You\u2019re a grown woman. It\u2019s up to you whether you post things online or not. You even offered to block the people she doesn\u2019t like. Is your mum generally very controlling? Keep your instagram account, she\u2019ll get over it eventually.", "This is so frustrating.  You are NTA.
