Your behaviour towards your sister appears to be rather cruel. Dismissing her grief like that was unnecessary. It reads a little like it annoys you which isn't fair.

She yelled at you and told you to be sad how she wanted. At dinner, you told her to react how you wanted and she yelled again.

She just CAN'T do the minimum of keeping her trap shut while sister is expressing sadness without involving OP?

My dad passed,  but I'm NC with my mom. \n\nI'm so sorry you're dealing with this. \n\nAs someone who's been there, please try to pursue therapy when and how you can, even if you have to do it after moving out. \n\nIt's also not uncommon for us to take longer than NT folks to process, so you may still get hit with The Feels (TM) at some point. And that's okay, whatever they are. Just try to remember to express them in a way that doesn't hurt others or cause more problems for you. I personally hate journaling, but that can be helpful. So can art or exercise or jamming out to music. \n\nIn these situations, I try to have practiced lines like, \"that's such a nice memory\" or \"you must really miss her.\" That way I don't offend anyone but I'm still being true to myself.", "Not going to a parent's funeral is going to raise eyebrows.  Of course people are going to ask questions.", "And yet! Your dad can go to the funeral, cook a nice nostalgic meal for your sister and care about her feelings when she gets upset.

You do have to respect that deaths, and grief in general for that matter, hit different people differently and if someone is more outwardly emotional, give them the grace not to pick on them or tell them to stop.  If it is ok for you to be stoic, then it has to be ok for them not to be.  There is no time limit on grief either, you don't get to say \"It's been a year, enough already\"\n\nSkipping the funeral was cruel to the other surviving family members, but if you were going to act there the way you acted when your sister teared up at dinner, it is probably for the best that you stayed away because you acted downright disgustingly at that dinner.

I get the sister is upset and is lashing out - but that\u2019s not fair either. \n\nOP is also a jerk for throwing some digs in - like wanting to take the potatoes. \n\nOP just wanted to be left alone. And not deal or see people during the funeral. Funerals are super tough. And some just hide away to not handle it. Someone ASD may feel better to be away from it. Different levels of ASD affect how one would react. They both are jerks though. And ASD doesn\u2019t give her the right to be a jerk.

You have no idea of her level of autism or the relationship she had with her mother.
