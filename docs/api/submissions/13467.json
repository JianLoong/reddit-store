I don't like being around people that are constantly crying so I skipped most of my mother's funeral and went home to play some video games and take care of my cat. My sister is still mad about me skipping the funeral and hasn't let go of it yet. After the funeral she threw a fit at me and called me an emotionless bi word to leave her and my father alone with our other relatives asking where I was.

I received many calls from my aunts and uncles asking why I was absent through out the funeral and I had to waste my time explaining this is my way of grieving.\n\n\n\nYesterday my sister decided to visit us and my father cooked her favourite dish. My sister got emotional on the table stating how she remembered mom used to cook this dish for her and it tastes the same. I told her that was incredibly nice but she should stop crying or else I will take her potatoes (I love potatoes). She got annoyed and told me something in the lines of she's just expressing her feelings and there's nothing wrong with it and I should express my emotions too and she knows how much I also miss mom. I told her I don't about someone's death and it happens to everyone eventually and I have more important things to worry about.

Your behaviour towards your sister appears to be rather cruel. Dismissing her grief like that was unnecessary. It reads a little like it annoys you which isn't fair.

She yelled at you and told you to be sad how she wanted. At dinner, you told her to react how you wanted and she yelled again.

And that's okay, whatever they are. Just try to remember to express them in a way that doesn't hurt others or cause more problems for you. I personally hate journaling, but that can be helpful.

There is no time limit on grief either, you don't get to say \"It's been a year, enough already\"\n\nSkipping the funeral was cruel to the other surviving family members, but if you were going to act there the way you acted when your sister teared up at dinner, it is probably for the best that you stayed away because you acted downright disgustingly at that dinner.

She has not had the support to set her up to handle this well. She was in the wrong? But it\u2019s not a simple situation and wrong isn\u2019t always malicious. Sometimes wrong is just ignorant, and you\u2019re still responsible for the consequences of that, but intent does have an inpact", "she\u2019s a minor, she can\u2019t yet", "Yeah. Based on how I interpreted the post, the only thing OP loves is potato\u2019s. F*ck family but by golly those potatoes are important lol sorry but the juxtaposition of the callousness towards humans and the humanity towards potatoes just made me chuckle. But yeah OP you\u2019re not just TA, it\u2019s actually genuinely concerning.", "I kind of got the impressions that OP wasn\u2019t really telling the truth when she said it was her way of grieving and only said that to get her family to stop bothering her.", "I misread and thought it said 19.\n\nSchool counselors are there to help. And she\u2019s one year off from being an \u201cadult\u201d so she could seek help then.", "How can the mom be the cause of her autism? Please don't say vaccines ; )", "I dunno dude. Why is her mother the root of all these issues and her father blameless? Aren\u2019t there two parents?\n\nWhy does she pretend to grieve then say she has no respect for her dead mother and hates her.\n\nWhy does she have an autism diagnosis but has never been able to see a mental health professional?", "Maybe there\u2019s some truth to that, but maybe her family should have stopped bothering her without cornering her into saying whatever would shit them up. They were pressuring her to grieve their way, the \u201ccorrect\u201d way. Weather she\u2019s grieving differently or not at all, it\u2019s still not her responsibility to force herself to feel a way she doesn\u2019t to appease the older members of her family. We can calm it her \u201cprocess\u201d\nIf it might not be grief, but she isn\u2019t being allowed to have the process she\u2019s comfortable with, but then being expected to be supportive of other peoples\u2019 process because it\u2019s considered \u201cnormal\u201d even though it doesn\u2019t feel normal to her.", "I'm not saying everyone has to love their mother (or any family members for that matter) but there does need to be a good reason not to. To even title this post \"someone's death\" and not \"my mother's death\" as if she's just talking about a stranger is really cold.", "NTA: you aren\u2019t responsible for your sister\u2019s feelings and you communicated that you would be unable to offer the comfort and support she needs. She\u2019s demanding that you perform a function that you can not execute and throwing a fit. Sorry your family couldn\u2019t learn to cope with your autism. And continue to make you suffer for the way your brain works. I hope someday your surviving family figures out that there is nothing wrong with you. You are as your biology allows.", "YTA.\n\nYou have every right to react to your nother's death in your way, but so does everyone else. You're getting annoyed when people tell you they don't approve of the way you're handling your feelings, yet you're doing the same to everyone else. \n\nHow can you expect your sister to respect your feelings when you're so viciously disrespecting hers?", "NTA for everything other than gatekeeping your sister's emotions.", "I would be willing to bet she made that decision after getting to know you", "I\u2019m autistic myself. If my mother died I would be absolutely crushed.\n\n My dad on the other hand tried to beat the autism out of me. He also kicked me out of the house in my senior year of high school forcing me to drop out and live out of my car for 6 months. That cost me my full ride to Duke. So when he dies I won\u2019t shed a tear. I\u2019ll be dancing on his grave.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d never speak to my family the way she spoke to her sister though. I\u2019ve learned how cold my tone can be, and put a lot of effort into trying to understand and be kind.", "Thanks for the comment.  I agree that some emotions are not justified in the sense that they are a reaction to some false belief or understanding.  So I think I understand what you mean by \"justified\"\n\nBut what did it mean to say they were all \"valid\" in therapy?  Did it just mean, as others have said, that emotions are beyond criticism or something similar?", "I get what you're trying to say, but that's stupid as hell.", "Yeah, that you're not wrong or bad or whatever for feeling how you feel or having emotions. \n\n\nA lot of this therapy was healing from invalidation of feelings so like when you're upset or sad and someone says 'suck it up/it's not that bad/others have it worse' or anything to imply there are emotions that one 'should' or 'shouldn't' feel. So all emotions are valid in that sense, but they may not all be justified. So we gotta healthy process and handle them and not react in 'emotion mind.' bc that tends to cause chaos.", "So your point is pretty stupid considering it\u2019s not even applicable to the majority.", "but if that was the case wouldn\u2019t she have mentioned she had autism without the comments prompting her?", "Yeah and also she literally said she didn\u2019t care in the post but was then she was aware enough of her actions to try and pretend to relatives that this was just her \u2018way of grieving\u2019. Like which is it?"]}
