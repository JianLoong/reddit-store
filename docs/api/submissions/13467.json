You dont need to feel the way others do, but you need to learn - Written by person with an autistic best friend who has learned that yes, understanding and empathy is important to have for their situation, but they need to be just as understanding and empathetic to me as I am to them.\n\nI don't require of them or of OP to stop being autistic, to change their feelings or anything the likes.

OP isn't either.", "Wait, who\u2019s the victim?", "Except even if the intent is not there they are coming off as an awful, uncaring human.   They are being perceived as uncaring by their sister and their dad.  They need to recognize that, the family can have sympathy but they lost (and care) their moms and wife.   When grieving and being told to stop crying comes off as a complete asshole.  You and OP need to understand that.   Their intent is not meant to be an asshole but they are perceived as one.", "If advice is what she seeks, there\u2019s Reddit subs for that.", "This sub is for judgement not advice. Sorry. OP. YTA. I\u2019m not here to rehabilitate their shitty behavior.", "It's not that they're pushing their grief, they are trying to push their sibling, OP, into grieving in a way that they don't feel comfortable with. OP doesn't even seem comfortable grieving this loss at all, because it's not much of a loss for them. Yet sister is constantly saying you should grieve you should show more emotion You should have been at the funeral, instead of just accepting how OP feels. So if the sister isn't going to accept that why should OP be forced to just deal with that?? Why is it okay to try and push someone to grieve the way you are?\n\nSince I am also neurodivergent, I'm saying the way I genuinely grieve is a lot like the way OP says they were just wasting time. So while in this specific instance OP might not actually be grieving, this might be the way they genuinely grieve those who are close to them as well, so I can understand that. I don't feel comfortable being around people who are grieving. Because I don't grieve the same way. I process most deaths quite quickly, and move on. So I don't feel comfortable when someone tells me that I should be crying, or that I should be expressing an outwardly display of emotion, simply because they are. That's disrespectful to my grieving process. Now I don't go out of my way to make comments about it like OP did, but if my family were too constantly push me and not respect my way of grieving, then I feel like I might reach a breaking point to and stop caring about their grieving process, considering they don't care about the way I'm grieving. I recognize that people grieve in different ways, so I don't get to push my way of grieving on to someone else. I don't get to tell them how they should be reacting or trying to act. That's disrespectful. I feel like this isn't everyone sucks situation, because neither side is seeming to respect the others grieving process.", "Well that\u2019s why she\u2019s putting herself out there on AITA asking for advice\u2026 she\u2019s trying to learn if she was wrong\u2026\n\nThe husband was trying to do an ice thing\u2026 there really is no pleasing you is there?
