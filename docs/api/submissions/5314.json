They surrounded it with carts and waited for the owner to come out. Owner came out and was a small super old lady who had obvious issues moving and was slowly pushing her cart to her car. She saw the carts and burst into tears and the people who used the carts to surround her car put their heads down and walked away, didn't even help remove them. It stuck with me pretty hard thinking that could possibly have been my grandma. Though, we made sure our grandma was always accompanied by someone to the store.", "Yup! You did everything right.

I appreciate your input and advice.", "I actually did leave a note on their car after seeing it repeatedly, asking them to please not utilize a handicap space as there are people here who TRULY need it.

They live in the same building and can retaliate.\n\nPeople who are entitled and selfish enough to park in the handicap space are not going to take accountability when towed.  They are going to blame someone else for the consequence of their actions and attack.\n\nCall the towing company and keep this anonymous.", "Honestly, I think others have said something too.", "I mean, you care enough to comment. So clearly you do.", "The vigilante behavior of those people was not ok.\n\nI have been screamed at by people who have decided that I don't look disabled enough to have my disabled plates, which is not ok.\n\nIf I drive my daughter's car without plates, I don't get to park in disabled spots.
