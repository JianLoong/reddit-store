Reading between the lines, someone who is described as controlling and who weaponises his own kids is abusive.

It is unfortunate that you couldnt of had a healthy breakup so you could still see your former stepchildren, however I think in doing os, he will tell the kids you guys are getting back togther, and he wont stop using the kids as a way to controle you, for your own mental health...you need to walk away...for your future child..walk away", "I had to do the same thing. They were 5 and 8 when I met them, and 8 and 11 when I had to leave the relationship because of my ex's insane anger, possiveness, and controlling nature. Any time I wasn't around him was a problem. He isolated me from my friends, controlled what I wore, who I talked to, and he depended on me financially. He wouldn't pay his car payment and his car kept getting towed, and he just expected me to pay for it every time. And omg the constant lies. I finally broke it off for good (took me six tries). We worked in the same building (him in the facility) so I could not actually escape him until Covid stay at home orders finally set me free.\n\nIt's been three years since I've seen his daughters and I miss them very much.

I hope you can cut contact so he no longer feels motivated to use his kids to abuse you.", "INFO why aren\u2019t the children allowed to see their mother?", "NTA- but save those messages. Use them in court. He needs to be held accountable for messing with the children like that.", "Nta. Ex on the other hand? Utter AH. He's using his kids to manipulate you, but honestly... They're not your kids nor your problem. Probably get down voted for that, but you need to look after yourself and your own safety.", "More info needed. There's a lot to unpack here. And you haven't said whether it would be dangerous to be near your ex and your ex's kids, or if you just would prefer not to be. You mention \"his control\" but that could be something terrible or not, depending. \n\nYour ex is TA for guilting you with crying videos.

Can you take them to your place a couple days a week or something?

Just wondering if there\u2019s a middle ground when it comes to the kids.", "This is heartbreaking. Is there a possible compromise somewhere? Like could one of your ex' adult relatives be a go between to facilitate some visits? So you can still be NC with him?\n\nMight give you the chance to explain to the kids why you're NC with their father, in an age appropriate way. And if they're mature enough, maybe be able to converse with them online now and again. \n\nNTA. I don't think you owe them anything. But in real life, there are gray areas like your relationship with the kids, where perhaps it's good to gently nurture. But you'd need to create proper boundaries since their father isn't going away.  And both sides may drift apart, especially as they get into their teens and will be leading lives apart from yours.", "NTA not your kids. He's looking at having future child support.

You could have him drop off the kids with your family \u2014 then meet your family elsewhere. If your safety is a concern, get a restraining order & make the \u201csecret\u201d meeting place near a police station, etc. Visiting the kids is doable if you truly care about them.

The police will be sure to investigate after he kills her. This is not a joke. The police do very little to prevent crime.\n\nAll this was after her husband broke her jaw and put her in the hospital and she had a restraining order against him and a court order for visitation.\n\nThe police are little to no use when it comes to saving battered spouses or enforcing any court order. They won't act preemptively.\n\nI went over, armed, and took my sister-in-law to pick up the children, and told her ex I was taking them to my home.

I understand that", "In most jurisdictions I know of - not at first.\n\nThe baby will go home with her and most jurisdictions agree its not good for a newborn to do split time. He'll get visitation but likely won't be able to get any overnights for 6-18 months.  \n\nIf she can prove he's a danger it will potentially be supervised visits where he has to pay for a court appointed professional to supervise. \n\nHe will potentially be able to work his way up to joint custody, which will likely take years and multiple returns to court.\n\nIf he isn't automatically on the birth certificate (only husbands are, and not always) then she can make him go through the courts for a paternity test and to get on the birth certificate.\n\nThat can take weeks/months and during that time he has 0 rights to the child and op will not be penalized for not allowing him access, as until he's on the birth certificate he has no legal rights to the child.  However since they're divorcing, in most jurisdictions he will still be considered the father from birth.\n\nThis is not all jurisdictions but it's my understanding of, I believe, every US state and many other countries.\n\nIn some countries he'll basically have 0 access or rights to the child for years if ever - but that's not usually the case in America.\n\nThat said if she's this scared she honestly may be better off seeing if it's possible to have an abortion.  I know that's not a decision made lightly.", "And he could follow her. Your comments are even less helpful.", "Since she's a stepparent, in many areas she wouldn't have custody rights unless she adopted the children.
