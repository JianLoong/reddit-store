{"id": 14986, "submission_id": "12oxgy4", "title": "AITA for breaking my fianc\u00e9's family tradition by naming my son what I wanted?", "selftext": "Throwaway because I have in-laws on Reddit.\n\nMyself (25F) and my fianc\u00e9 (27M) have a 2 month old son. We are overjoyed at being parents, but most of my in-laws are refusing to even see our baby because of a decision we made concerning his name.\n\nMy in-laws have a tradition of giving the first-born son of every generation the same name. Let's say it's \"Peter\". This has been going on for about seven generations already, and they're very serious about it. My fianc\u00e9's eldest cousin was the latest person to get named Peter. Every one of his cousins has only had daughters so far, so our baby is the first son of his generation, and consequently should get the name.\n\nI have no problem with the name Peter, and would've been okay with naming my son that. Unfortunately, that was also the name of my uncle, who died before I was born. I won't get into details, but it was tragic and traumatizing for my family. My father never got over losing his younger brother.\n\nMy grandmother asked the family not to name any of our future children Peter during her lifetime. My MIL and FIL knew about this promise, and at first seemed to not only be okay with us avoiding the name Peter, but also supportive of the one we chose.\n\nHowever, my grandmother sadly passed away when I was 7 months pregnant. We traveled for her funeral. On our last days there, my in-laws called to offer me their condolences. Then my MIL asked me if I was willing to \"think about the name Peter now.\"\n\nSuddenly, they were insistent that the name we chose was awful and we had to honor their tradition. According to them, they had only agreed to make an exception for us for my grandmother's sake, and had no obligation to keep it now that she had passed.\n\nMy family agrees that while it's true we don't have to avoid the name anymore, it still doesn't feel right to use it. My fianc\u00e9 agrees with me as well, but his parents spent the last weeks of my pregnancy trying to convince us to change our minds about the name.\n\nWhen our baby was born and we named him what we wanted, my in-laws were furious that we had broken a 7-generation-old family tradition. Some of them hadn't previously wanted to name their sons Peter, but did it anyway for the family's sake. They said our decision was selfish, and that my family \"should have moved on by now.\"\n\nThis has truly nothing to do with whether my family has moved on or not, it just felt like a betrayal to my grandmother and uncle's memories to even consider using the name.\n\nMy FIL offered us $1000 to change our son's name to Peter after he was born. That was two months ago, and neither of my fianc\u00e9's parents have met the baby or seen us since I was pregnant. Most of my in-laws are on their side, and this is causing a huge rift between my fianc\u00e9 and his family. He assures me he's fine, but I'm starting to feel really guilty about this.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: The tradition started, as far as I know, when OG Peter died and his son, also named Peter, named his firstborn after his father. Peter III ended up having the first son of the following generation, and did the same thing. That one died before having children, so his sister gave the name to her son, and so on. The name \u201cPeter\u201d is very common in my country, so none of them ever got bullied over it, and the fact that it was also my uncle\u2019s name isn\u2019t as unlikely as one might think.\n\nAlso, middle names aren\u2019t common in my country. Most people get the maternal surname before the paternal one instead.", "created_utc": 1681696370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12oxgy4/aita_for_breaking_my_fianc\u00e9s_family_tradition_by/", "score": 820, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However there are times when guilt is what my therapist called \u201cinappropriate guilt\u201d, and that\u2019s when you feel guilty over things you don\u2019t need to, don\u2019t deserve to, or shouldn\u2019t ever feel guilty for. Oftentimes we feel this inappropriate guilt when others get upset over or strongly disagree with our choices/boundaries, especially if they also guilt trip us about it.\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with inappropriate guilt many times in my life before. My therapist recommended me to go through these questions and phrases when I\u2019m wondering if my guilt is \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d guilt:\n\n* Why are you feeling guilty?\n* Did you actually do something wrong or cause real harm to the other person? (And no, them being inconvenienced or upset that they didn\u2019t get their way is NOT harm!)\n* Or did you do something innocuous (not harmful) that the other person just doesn\u2019t want you to do?\n* Does the other person have an ulterior motive for making you feel guilty?\n* Is the other person a reasonable, trustworthy person? Or do they have a history of manipulation, mooching, selfishness, guilt tripping, and/or cruel behavior?\n\nIf you did do wrong then apologize and make things right with the person you wronged/harmed.\n\nHowever if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and they\u2019re guilt tripping you then reminding yourself of these phrases might help:\n\n* You\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions or how they choose to react to your decisions. If your actions aren\u2019t harming anyone, yet someone else chooses to be upset over it anyways, then that\u2019s their choice to make- let them be upset!\n* You are not responsible for other people\u2019s (or their children\u2019s) mental, emotional, financial, or physical well-being. It\u2019s on them to take care of themselves and their dependents, not you.\n* It\u2019s ok to disagree with other people over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok for other people to be upset over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d to something that harms or inconveniences you, or even if you just plain don\u2019t want to do it.\n* Just because someone is upset it doesn\u2019t automatically mean you did anything wrong. Sometimes people get upset just because they\u2019re not getting their way.\n* It\u2019s not your job to fix the situation or their emotions. Their emotions are their responsibility to manage.\n* Being a good person does not equal being a doormat! You can be a kind, generous person and set healthy boundaries, refuse to tolerate disrespect towards you/your loved ones, and not allow others to take advantage of you.\n* You matter too! Prioritizing your mental, emotional, financial, and physical well-being is important.\n* Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.
