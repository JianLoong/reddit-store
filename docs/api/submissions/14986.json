{"id": 14986, "submission_id": "12oxgy4", "title": "AITA for breaking my fianc\u00e9's family tradition by naming my son what I wanted?", "selftext": "Throwaway because I have in-laws on Reddit.\n\nMyself (25F) and my fianc\u00e9 (27M) have a 2 month old son. We are overjoyed at being parents, but most of my in-laws are refusing to even see our baby because of a decision we made concerning his name.\n\nMy in-laws have a tradition of giving the first-born son of every generation the same name. Let's say it's \"Peter\". This has been going on for about seven generations already, and they're very serious about it. My fianc\u00e9's eldest cousin was the latest person to get named Peter. Every one of his cousins has only had daughters so far, so our baby is the first son of his generation, and consequently should get the name.\n\nI have no problem with the name Peter, and would've been okay with naming my son that. Unfortunately, that was also the name of my uncle, who died before I was born. I won't get into details, but it was tragic and traumatizing for my family. My father never got over losing his younger brother.\n\nMy grandmother asked the family not to name any of our future children Peter during her lifetime. My MIL and FIL knew about this promise, and at first seemed to not only be okay with us avoiding the name Peter, but also supportive of the one we chose.\n\nHowever, my grandmother sadly passed away when I was 7 months pregnant. We traveled for her funeral. On our last days there, my in-laws called to offer me their condolences. Then my MIL asked me if I was willing to \"think about the name Peter now.\"\n\nSuddenly, they were insistent that the name we chose was awful and we had to honor their tradition. According to them, they had only agreed to make an exception for us for my grandmother's sake, and had no obligation to keep it now that she had passed.\n\nMy family agrees that while it's true we don't have to avoid the name anymore, it still doesn't feel right to use it. My fianc\u00e9 agrees with me as well, but his parents spent the last weeks of my pregnancy trying to convince us to change our minds about the name.\n\nWhen our baby was born and we named him what we wanted, my in-laws were furious that we had broken a 7-generation-old family tradition. Some of them hadn't previously wanted to name their sons Peter, but did it anyway for the family's sake. They said our decision was selfish, and that my family \"should have moved on by now.\"\n\nThis has truly nothing to do with whether my family has moved on or not, it just felt like a betrayal to my grandmother and uncle's memories to even consider using the name.\n\nMy FIL offered us $1000 to change our son's name to Peter after he was born. That was two months ago, and neither of my fianc\u00e9's parents have met the baby or seen us since I was pregnant. Most of my in-laws are on their side, and this is causing a huge rift between my fianc\u00e9 and his family. He assures me he's fine, but I'm starting to feel really guilty about this.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: The tradition started, as far as I know, when OG Peter died and his son, also named Peter, named his firstborn after his father. Peter III ended up having the first son of the following generation, and did the same thing. That one died before having children, so his sister gave the name to her son, and so on. The name \u201cPeter\u201d is very common in my country, so none of them ever got bullied over it, and the fact that it was also my uncle\u2019s name isn\u2019t as unlikely as one might think.\n\nAlso, middle names aren\u2019t common in my country. Most people get the maternal surname before the paternal one instead.\n\nEDIT 2: It wasn't 1000 dollars. Different country, different currency. It's still a lot of money, but would probably translate to about 200 USD.", "created_utc": 1681696370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12oxgy4/aita_for_breaking_my_fianc\u00e9s_family_tradition_by/", "score": 1325, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However there are times when guilt is what my therapist called \u201cinappropriate guilt\u201d, and that\u2019s when you feel guilty over things you don\u2019t need to, don\u2019t deserve to, or shouldn\u2019t ever feel guilty for. Oftentimes we feel this inappropriate guilt when others get upset over or strongly disagree with our choices/boundaries, especially if they also guilt trip us about it.\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with inappropriate guilt many times in my life before. My therapist recommended me to go through these questions and phrases when I\u2019m wondering if my guilt is \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d guilt:\n\n* Why are you feeling guilty?\n* Did you actually do something wrong or cause real harm to the other person? (And no, them being inconvenienced or upset that they didn\u2019t get their way is NOT harm!)\n* Or did you do something innocuous (not harmful) that the other person just doesn\u2019t want you to do?\n* Does the other person have an ulterior motive for making you feel guilty?\n* Is the other person a reasonable, trustworthy person? Or do they have a history of manipulation, mooching, selfishness, guilt tripping, and/or cruel behavior?\n\nIf you did do wrong then apologize and make things right with the person you wronged/harmed.\n\nHowever if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and they\u2019re guilt tripping you then reminding yourself of these phrases might help:\n\n* You\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions or how they choose to react to your decisions. If your actions aren\u2019t harming anyone, yet someone else chooses to be upset over it anyways, then that\u2019s their choice to make- let them be upset!\n* You are not responsible for other people\u2019s (or their children\u2019s) mental, emotional, financial, or physical well-being. It\u2019s on them to take care of themselves and their dependents, not you.\n* It\u2019s ok to disagree with other people over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok for other people to be upset over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d to something that harms or inconveniences you, or even if you just plain don\u2019t want to do it.\n* Just because someone is upset it doesn\u2019t automatically mean you did anything wrong. Sometimes people get upset just because they\u2019re not getting their way.\n* It\u2019s not your job to fix the situation or their emotions. Their emotions are their responsibility to manage.\n* Being a good person does not equal being a doormat! You can be a kind, generous person and set healthy boundaries, refuse to tolerate disrespect towards you/your loved ones, and not allow others to take advantage of you.\n* You matter too! Prioritizing your mental, emotional, financial, and physical well-being is important.\n* Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.

They\u2019d name the oldest son \u2018Peter\u2019 and then have a unique middle name and the person would go by their middle name. \n\n(All below names are fake) \n\nSo Peter Joseph Smith (great-great-Great grandpa Joe). \nThen his oldest son, Peter Michael Smith (g-g-grandpa Michael).  \nThen his oldest son, Peter Michael Oliver Smith (g-grandpa Oliver). \nThen his oldest son, Peter Oliver Smith Jr (grandpa Pete). \nThen his oldest son, Peter Daniel Smith (Uncle Dan). \n\nUncle Dan broke the line lol. His son is not Peter. My dad is the second son and he also didn\u2019t name any of his kids Peter. Third and last brother had no sons. (None of my aunts named a kid Peter either lol)\n\nAll of us cousins from that side are parent age (and one is grandparent age). No more Peter Smiths or even just Peter\u2019s have emerged from this side. \n\nIf I have a boy I might use it as a middle name, but that\u2019s not guaranteed. It\u2019s a little sad that a family tradition has ended, but tradition is just peer pressure from dead ppl if it\u2019s not also what you want to do. \n\nI will say, as a very amateur genealogist, the idea of not having to detangle the various generations \u201cPeter Smith\u201ds, both very common names even before being passed down for 4-5 generations in the same family line, is very attractive. \ud83d\ude02", "Your in-laws are very clearly assholes.  They are not going to see a child because you didn't give the child the right name? WTF?\n\nHowever, you say that you are fine with 'Peter' and would have named the child 'Peter' except that your grandmother asked you not to while she was alive but then died before the child was born.  So why is naming the child 'Peter' a problem?\n\nIt is fine to say the in-laws shouldn't get to tell you how to name your child but why are you falling back on 'my family feels like it is wrong to use that name?'  Either you get to ignore family or you don't.  Right?", "^^ Seconded. Or me.", "NTA. \nYeah. For her to get another sibling to adopt an older kid named Peter. You get to name your child.", "They didn't. My family didn't force me not to use the name after my grandmother passed, I just genuinely felt it would be disrespectful to them.", "As a parent, I'm disgusted too. How could you not want to be a part of your child and grandchild's life over something so ridiculous!!!", "OP, let me tell you a story\n\nBoth my step cousin and brother are named after my stepgrandpa, we'll call him Joe Parker.\n\nWhich means that two boys in the same town, 2 years apart, looking similar due to being family, are called 'Joe Parker'. \n\nStep *brother* is a **convicted felon**\n\nThis has caused an untold amount of problems for step cousin. Because SB ends up being the results for SC during background checks, tickets, you name it\n\nBecause while SG can be ignored, he's both born decades before (and now dead), both SB and SC are Joe Parker born in the 90s in Quahog, Rhode Island, and look alike.", "Well, you/the person that originally posted this just changed my life. \n\nThank you!", "I honestly thought of this post first, too, but here [it](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mxt6w/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_some_traditions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) is", "That\u2019s still giving them skin in the game.

His family's tradition actually sounds more strict than my fianc\u00e9's, each generation only has one Peter. But it's reassuring to know we're not crazy.", "Traditions are always funny to me, same with religion. You only believe it because it was what you were taught by your parents/guardians at an age where to you their words were written in stone. \n\nLike I wonder if someone were to push them what is the reason they matters that much? I suppose they could say it's to keep the 'linage' going but it's just a name, a first name at that... So what is it just a sunk-cost fallacy? \n\nI just find it hilarious 'name your son Peter because you have to' the reasoning just doesn't really make sense? I understand why they believe it makes sense but I don't think it's worth it or logical to convince others like they are doing.", "Yeah, having tons of Peters (who I'm guessing all/most share the same name due to being boys) is a HUGE problem\n\nHeck, I verify insurance. I've had mix ups where they almost got disqualified because Peter 2 was given Peter 9's health form. They were both Peter BabyName", "Well, you both changed my life.

This is your baby and you should name them whatever makes you and your husband happy.

The name tradition here is a result of a close family. The early Peters wanted to honor lost family by naming their kid Peter. (Except the 2nd peter, that one sounds like it was just ego.) It was a choice. And the choice is what is special. The fact that your in laws are trying to force you to name your son Peter, and willing to cut contact with you, with family, over the name completely defeats the purpose of this tradition.
