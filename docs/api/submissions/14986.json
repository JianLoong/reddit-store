We are overjoyed at being parents, but most of my in-laws are refusing to even see our baby because of a decision we made concerning his name.\n\nMy in-laws have a tradition of giving the first-born son of every generation the same name. Let's say it's \"Peter\". This has been going on for about seven generations already, and they're very serious about it. My fianc\u00e9's eldest cousin was the latest person to get named Peter. Every one of his cousins has only had daughters so far, so our baby is the first son of his generation, and consequently should get the name.\n\nI have no problem with the name Peter, and would've been okay with naming my son that. Unfortunately, that was also the name of my uncle, who died before I was born. I won't get into details, but it was tragic and traumatizing for my family. My father never got over losing his younger brother.\n\nMy grandmother asked the family not to name any of our future children Peter during her lifetime. My MIL and FIL knew about this promise, and at first seemed to not only be okay with us avoiding the name Peter, but also supportive of the one we chose.\n\nHowever, my grandmother sadly passed away when I was 7 months pregnant. We traveled for her funeral. On our last days there, my in-laws called to offer me their condolences. Then my MIL asked me if I was willing to \"think about the name Peter now.\"\n\nSuddenly, they were insistent that the name we chose was awful and we had to honor their tradition. According to them, they had only agreed to make an exception for us for my grandmother's sake, and had no obligation to keep it now that she had passed.\n\nMy family agrees that while it's true we don't have to avoid the name anymore, it still doesn't feel right to use it. My fianc\u00e9 agrees with me as well, but his parents spent the last weeks of my pregnancy trying to convince us to change our minds about the name.\n\nWhen our baby was born and we named him what we wanted, my in-laws were furious that we had broken a 7-generation-old family tradition. Some of them hadn't previously wanted to name their sons Peter, but did it anyway for the family's sake. They said our decision was selfish, and that my family \"should have moved on by now.\"\n\nThis has truly nothing to do with whether my family has moved on or not, it just felt like a betrayal to my grandmother and uncle's memories to even consider using the name.\n\nMy FIL offered us $1000 to change our son's name to Peter after he was born. That was two months ago, and neither of my fianc\u00e9's parents have met the baby or seen us since I was pregnant. Most of my in-laws are on their side, and this is causing a huge rift between my fianc\u00e9 and his family. He assures me he's fine, but I'm starting to feel really guilty about this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681696370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12oxgy4/aita_for_breaking_my_fianc\u00e9s_family_tradition_by/", "score": 221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Grandma died so everything we agreed to while she was alive was a big LIE? Um, hello? That\u2019s not how this works.\n\nYou broke a 7-year family tradition? You\u2019re all going to He$$ in a hand-basket.\n\nYou should ask Hank Williams, Jr. how that \u201cfamily tradition\u201d worked out for his dad, Hank Williams, Sr.\n\n\"So if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition\" is a reference to Hank Williams Sr., the father of Hank Williams Jr. His father was addicted to alcohol and painkillers and died at the age of 30.\n\nSee, family traditions\u2014not always a good thing.\n\nOffering money to change your son\u2019s name is a new low in grand parenting. Shame, shame. Now there\u2019s a nice bedtime story to tell your son when he\u2019s older, right?\n\n\u201cSon, grandma and grandpa didn\u2019t like your name that we chose for you. So they decided to see you\u2026.NEVER.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s the ticket.", "NTA- I get the importance of keeping a tradition alive but family cannot put the tradition above the family members. Begging and even offering you money to change YOUR SON (NOT theirs) is absolutely an overreach.\n\nSorry but it is what it is family tradition cannot take over something that\u2019s important as your child", "100% not the asshole. NTA NTA! Who the fuck are they to feel entitled to select another human being's name, or impose their traditions on you?! \n\n>On our last days there, my in-laws called to offer me their condolences. Then my MIL asked me if I was willing to \"think about the name Peter now.\"\n\n>My FIL offered us $1000 to change our son's name to Peter after he was born.\n\nHow very, very, very disrespectful!!! I can't believe it. Sounds like some crazy cult or something.\n\n>Most of my in-laws are on their side, and this is causing a huge rift between my fianc\u00e9 and his family.\n\nTell 'em all to fuck right off. And please do not even consider going along with this creepy behavior of theirs. Wtf is wrong with people, geez....", "Forcing a name is a dumb tradition that should die so fuck your in-laws if they're all pissed at you for that. Don't change his name because they're being entitled brats. You carried him for 9 months, you gave birth to him, you get to decide what his name is. If he wants to change it when he's older then that's his choice, not theirs. \n\nThey should think about starting a different tradition, maybe one that doesn't suck. How about having a NERF war every summer or Mario kart tournament at christmas or whatever \n\nNTA", "NTA: wow imagine not meeting your grandchild due to their name? Sorry little Timmy grandma and grandpa don\u2019t love you bc your name is not Peter", "NTA 100% but if you were wanting to appease his family you could change his legal first name Peter and middle name to the name you chose, but he would still go by the name you chose/middle name. I know a few people who have this family name thing going on and have done it this way i guess as a middle ground/compromise. His family may only refer to him as Peter though which is the case with one of the people I know in this situation.", "NTA  what if you had the same tradition in your family? You can name your kid whatever you want and if they refuse to be in their life because of a name, so be it.", "NTA. Tradition is just peer pressure from dead people\u2026 and your in laws apparently.", "We had patients and in their culture the firstborn sons were named after their father.....do you know how times we had no clue who the patient was till they came into the office.....some families had five or six with exactly the same names.\n\nThe only bonus was my ex-sil got great credit on his first Visa because they obviously looked at his dad's credit not his.", "NTA - You're not in their weird cult.", "Nta. This is some toxic shit. Family is immediate and anything more is your choice", "The grandparents value a name more than their actual grandson.  They sound like vain, vapid people with poor character.  OP is better off not having them meet her baby", "Do what makes you feel comfortable. It\u2019s good your fianc\u00e9 is on your side. Your in laws  sound selfish and terrible!!", "Did your fianc\u00e9 already post this question here?", "They said our decision was selfish, and that my family \"should have moved on by now.\"\n\nComing from the people who\u2019ve used the same name for seven generations now. Nta", "What about the hundreds of generations before that who didn't name their kids Peter? \n\nNTA", "Tradition is peer-pressure from the dead. Do people really think their dead ancestors give a shit about anything???", "I broke this dumb rule with my daughter. I could tell my mother was hurt, but she didn\u2019t say another word about it and now it\u2019s my nieces name. If your IL\u2019s are so petty that they won\u2019t visit their grandchild over a name, they are not worthy of a relationship with you or your family. Chalk it up to having dodged a bullet and move on in your life.", "Ah excellent response", "At 7 generations removed, Op's son probably shares less than 1.5% of their DNA with the founding Peter, because all those women who married into the family brought their own DNA and weren't just empty vessels waiting to be filled with Peter's potent seed.", "This is a very good point and I\u2019m mildly ashamed to say I\u2019d never thought of it before. Thanks for pointing that out", "Not always I know of a family where it\u2019s tradition for the oldest daughter to be named a certain name.

I don't think they'd be that psycho lol", "We were preparing my baby shower at the time. Most of the decorations and half of the gifts we got were personalized with my son's name. I was shocked my MIL even asked.", "He has a brother, but he's childfree. We're not sure if any of his cousins are planning on picking up the name.", "He doesn't \"have to\", he can name him every name he wants.", "My family actually has this problem with guys named Peter except it\u2019s totally by accident for the most part (relatives who married into the family). Every other guy at family gatherings is named Peter - it\u2019s actually a running joke that if you don\u2019t know someone\u2019s name it\u2019s probably Peter. It is odd. Not sure why anyone would want this on purpose. NTA OP.", "I didn't mean to imply that he wasn't happy about a son.  I just meant that he might have been hoping to avoid the conflict completely. Sorry if I offended.", "Here's something that might blow their minds.\n\nYour son probably shares very little genetics with their great grandparents.\n\nYour son has two copies of every gene: one from you and one from your husband.\n\nWhen your husband produced the sperm that made your son, it randomly selected one of each of his genes. That means it's _possible_ that he passed on all the genes he got from his mother and none of the genes he got from his father. And the same goes for your egg.\n\n_On average_, it's 50/50. But even that means that you share 50/25/12.5/6.25/3.125/1.5625/0.78125 percent of your genes with an ancestor who is 1/2/.../7 generations back.\n\nBasically, they are making a big deal about descension in one particular line, and ignoring all the other genetic lines that have contributed; but chances are, at this point, the newest generation barely has any genes at all from the foundational Peter.", "True.\n\nThe vast majority of my family (grandparents) are German descent. I have one Irish grandparent. I did a DNA test -- over 30% Irish, barely 20% German. The other 50 is English, Norwegian, Icelandic, Swedish and Scottish. (I know of ancestors from England -- they came to the US from the Kent area around 1640.)", "My partner's great-grandfather was one of 11 children. Their family reunions are so huge they literally all have numbered t-shirts with their name and which generation they belong to. Last reunion the count was over 300. I have no idea how anyone keeps track of that."]}
