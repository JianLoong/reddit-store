Brides who have weddings that don't allow children should understand that sometimes means whole families have to leave.", "NTA. You do what you have to do. She\u2019s entitled to a child free wedding and you\u2019re not in a position to have them watched and rightfully not going to leave your wife to do it while you enjoy the party. Enjoy what part you can and then tell them you have to go. If they can\u2019t accept that and get mad then they are the assholes.", "NTA - you are going to the family dinner and ceremony, paying for travel to another country. You will have shown up and shown love.", "**NAH**\n\nSince the bridal couple have made no arrangements for childcare, it would make sense for you, your wife and kids to leave after the ceremony as you will not be attending the child-free reception.", "No, YWNBTA No kids are allowed and you can\u2019t make alternate arrangements. What else are you supposed to do? It\u2019s unreasonable for your wife to have to watch all of your kids alone.

I myself am planning a child free wedding, and part of that decision has to be accepting that some guests may not be able to attend. I think you and your family still traveling and attending the child friendly parts of the day is going above and beyond - often parents who can't make arrangements for child care (understandably) opt to not attend at all", "NTA.\n\nYou're following their rules - no kids at the party. Due to their rules, unfortunately that also means you and your wife can't attend the party. That's the consequence of their action. \n\nYou should take the opportunity to do something fun with the kids and your wife while the others are at the party - make it a fun evening for your own family.", "NAH they have a right to hold a child-free wedding and you have the right to not attend parts of the wedding if you can't get childcare.

Have a wonderful time on your trip.", "INFO: This is weird, is your whole family still going to the other country but you\u2019d still be going to the wedding alone?

In this situation I would absolutely encourage my husband to stay at the party to celebrate with his brother while I stayed with the kids.  I did something similar at my BILs wedding.

You wouldn\u2019t be the ah, you\u2019re in a whole other country where there wouldn\u2019t be anyone else to help.

If I was in that position and my husband wanted to spend a little time partying with his brother on his wedding day, I wouldn't have an issue. Maybe find a hotel with a kids area and room service that delivers wine for your wife!! Just don't come back at 4 in the morning steaming drunk!", "NTA", "> My wife would definitly find me an asshole if i would leave here alone in a hotel with the kids while i would party.\n\nI don't want to judge your wife for this, because yes it's not fair to her at all, but I personally would have done exactly this for my husband if it's his close family or friends, and my husband would do the same for me as well.\n\nBut if you don't have that sort of marriage, then absolutely NTA for leaving together.\n\nWe had people from foreign countries with kids at our wedding and we specifically picked a venue with accommodation near the venue room so baby monitors worked ( we tried it before booking) and also didn't have a child free wedding partly because of these people. But they could put their kids to bed after dinner and carry on partying with a baby monitor and occasionally looking upstairs if all was well. Everyone was happy with this. In the afternoon we booked child entertainers in a room nearby so the parents could relax.", "NTA - this seems like the best option if your future SIL doesn't want kids at the party.  Go to the dinner and the wedding ceremony, then you all leave and go do something different.\n\nAs an alternative though, ask the hotel you're staying at if they have a professional child care service, or know of one that you could hire to babysit the kids at the hotel while you and your wife go to the party.", "YTA if you leave your wife and kids to go and party.\n\nIf your entire family is not welcome at a destination wedding you save your money and don\u2019t go altogether. If your brother wanted his nieces/nephews there he would put his foot down. This isn\u2019t just his bride, it\u2019s both of them. Don\u2019t let them insult your kids and make you pay good money to have your kids and wife ignored. \n\nPeople who have designation weddings have to accept some people will not be able to come. People who have childfree weddings have to accept that some people will not be able to come. And they need to accept it with good grace. They are the ones increasing the difficulty level for their guests, not the guests with children or the guests having to travel. Since you\u2019re doing both, they have increased the hardship on your family unnecessarily.", "We went to a wedding that had a special table for kids and even nannies and babysitters for the really young children \ud83d\ude40 it was the best ever. Mine was the oldest at 12 years old but my cousin\u2019s one year old has his own nanny and I have pictures to prove it, the guy cutting the pasta for him and taking him for walks. Half the wedding guests had come from different countries and continents including us for this event and the bride and groom had to find a way to include everybody, they also had the means so it worked out perfectly for everybody.", "Or is there another family with kids making their own child care arrangements that you could join? Some cousins your kids should spend some time with while visiting the country? Babysitters are often happy to have more kids as long as you pay.", "I would do that as a wife too for husband and vice versa. But his wife is NTA for finding that unfair.", "OK, sure. But I'm guessing the wife has been alone with their children before and probably can handle a few hours alone after dinner. There really isn't a need for both of them to miss the party except spite. I can see they are annoyed by this but having OP miss the whole party doesn't solve anything.", "Well it\u2019s the brothers decision to not have children at his after party which I certainly understand. But, you are married with children so I don\u2019t see how he should get mad at you to not go to the after party because it would be unfair to your wife to have to sit with the kids while you\u2019re out having fun. That would be the Ah move. Enjoy the wedding and dinner and bid them a happy life and spend the time with your family.", "How delicate is this woman?  How dangerous is this country? Y'all are sure assuming the worst."]}
