Brides who have weddings that don't allow children should understand that sometimes means whole families have to leave.", "NTA. You do what you have to do. She\u2019s entitled to a child free wedding and you\u2019re not in a position to have them watched and rightfully not going to leave your wife to do it while you enjoy the party. Enjoy what part you can and then tell them you have to go. If they can\u2019t accept that and get mad then they are the assholes.", "NTA - you are going to the family dinner and ceremony, paying for travel to another country. You will have shown up and shown love.", "**NAH**\n\nSince the bridal couple have made no arrangements for childcare, it would make sense for you, your wife and kids to leave after the ceremony as you will not be attending the child-free reception.", "No, YWNBTA No kids are allowed and you can\u2019t make alternate arrangements. What else are you supposed to do? It\u2019s unreasonable for your wife to have to watch all of your kids alone. It\u2019s fine if the engaged couple wants to have a child-free wedding, but they have to accept that some people won\u2019t be able to come.\n\nEdit: typo", "NAH your brother and his wife can absolutely request a child free wedding, and you can absolutely decide that means you cannot attend the reception. I myself am planning a child free wedding, and part of that decision has to be accepting that some guests may not be able to attend. I think you and your family still traveling and attending the child friendly parts of the day is going above and beyond - often parents who can't make arrangements for child care (understandably) opt to not attend at all", "NTA.\n\nYou're following their rules - no kids at the party. Due to their rules, unfortunately that also means you and your wife can't attend the party. That's the consequence of their action. \n\nYou should take the opportunity to do something fun with the kids and your wife while the others are at the party - make it a fun evening for your own family.", "NAH they have a right to hold a child-free wedding and you have the right to not attend parts of the wedding if you can't get childcare. If you were to make a fuss about them excluding you from the wedding because you can't take your kids that would make you an AH, and if they were to make a fuss about you not being able to attend the whole wedding, that would them the AH.", "If you leave your wife alone at a party she doesn't know anyone AH...but if you both leave after that with the kids NTA...unless you can afford to bring an extra family member with you to watch the kids or if in a hotel see if they have child care services\n\nIf other family if yours will be at this wedding can you find any family member with kids old enough to watch yours as well?", "NTA.", "NAH - just let your brother know that\u2019s your plan. The only one that may hear any complaints is your wife. So make it clear it\u2019s your choice to be with your family, don\u2019t throw your wife under the bus. Who knows bride & groom may ask you to stay if kids are well behaved. (IMO your wife should be prepared to keep kiddos with her while you celebrate with your family but that\u2019s her choice)", "NTA\n\nJust let your brother know you won't be attending the party after. You have your wife and kids. You're not leaving them alone in a foreign country. Plan to have brunch with him the following day....\n\nIf it's important for him for you to be there for the party...then he needs to come up with alternate plan.", "Nah I mean, what else would you do?  If a couple doesn't want kids at a wedding event, they have to be okay with people 1-not coming or 2- coming to the kid friendly bits and not attending the non-kid events.", "NAH  Your first obligation is to your family.  The couple chose a child free reception, so your planning accordingly.  Have a wonderful time on your trip.", "INFO: This is weird, is your whole family still going to the other country but you\u2019d still be going to the wedding alone? Why can\u2019t you and your wife go and have a sitter at home?", "NAH. It\u2019s not an unreasonable rule, but since you\u2019re travelling from another country and they haven\u2019t provided childcare, it\u2019s 100% alright for you both to leave early. I don\u2019t even have kids and I would be terrified to leave them alone or under the care of a stranger while we\u2019re all abroad.", "NTA but your wife would be the AH if she didn't let you stay and celebrate your brother's wedding while she takes the kids to the hotel.

A child free wedding is all well and good but they can't get mad when people with children can't participate in everything, especially if they have to travel far just to get there.", "My brother got married in Mexico City.  The hotel was able to arrange for a babysitter.", "Nah\n\nThat is the other side of a childfree wedding. They are free to ask for no children, you're free to not attend.", "NTA the couple has the right to want a child free party but they need to understand out of town guest will probably have to leave. And your wife would be in the right to be mad to be left alone with small children.", "NAH. Unless they didn't tell you until after you arrived. They're don't want kids at the reception and you have no daycare. You will attend what you can.", "NTA. \n\nThough I kinda think your wife is.  In this situation I would absolutely encourage my husband to stay at the party to celebrate with his brother while I stayed with the kids.  I did something similar at my BILs wedding.  Unless there\u2019s some safety concern for her being alone in the hotel, I see no issue with that.  If the hotel is near the party maybe you go with to help get the kids settled and than go back to the party for a bit.", "NAH\nWhile your brother and his fianc\u00e9e have every right to a kid-free wedding, as a parent, you are not wrong to care for your children.", "Might want to edit. As written it counts your vote as \"y w b t a\".", "I think you misinterpreted it. The wedding is in a country other than where they live. OP, his wife, and their kids are all going to the dinner and the wedding. The issue is that the newlyweds don't want kids at the after party. OP is asking if he should stay at the party or go back to the hotel with the wife and kids after the wedding.", "My wife and I and the kids are expected in the church and dinner.  \nMy other brother and parents will go to the wedding too.", "I don't know OP's personal situation or how old the youngest child is but I personally wouldn't feel comfortable with both me and my LO being in a different country while my LO is with a sitter. If anything we're to happen and at least one parent couldn't be with her is be horrified.", "That would also depend on the number and ages of the kids.  If they have, say, triplets that are three, trying to handle that in a hotel room could be a problem for one person.", "Normally I would agree....but leaving a woman alone in a foreign country doesn't sit well. I wouldn't be comfortable being left somewhere I don't speak the language and not familiar with. She came as a family for the wedding..... Family needs to stick together in this case.", "I don't think many parents would leave their kids with a hotel-provided stranger. Heavily depends on the age of the kids", "Thank you!", "Have you not had a conversation with your wife about this yet?", "She would be in the hotel room, not roaming the streets.", "my wife doesn't want me to party when she has to watch the kids in a hotel.  \nSo yes, i did spoke with her. I'm just worried about the reaction of my brother and parents.", "Doesn't matter. Bad things happen in hotels. She's not comfortable being left alone with the kids in a foreign country. Plus what if something happens to him?? OPs first responsibility is to his immediate family. He already made his choice. I think that's what people don't get. He is staying with his wife and kids no matter what. That's not up for debate.\n\nThey are attending the wedding and dinner and missing the after party. Leaving with his family doesn't make him the ahole."]}
