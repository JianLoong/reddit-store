His youngest, Bo, and I never really got along as well as I'd wished. We were usually cordial with one another but it was clear that he saw me as nothing more than his dad's dumb blonde arm piece. When my husband passed he left the house to me though I told them both that they were welcome come over to visit or just reminisce. And I absolutely meant it. The problem is that Bo has taken quite some advantage of this. He has a tendancy to literally just pop by *whenever* he wants at *whatever* time and just lets himself in without so much as notifying me. I'd wake up at night and go to the kitchen only to find him sitting in his dad's chair in the living room watching TV. Get woken up at 2am by someone walking around the garden only to find out its him. Walking around shirtless in what I though was an empty house just for him to walk out the bathroom. He was close with his dad and is struggling to deal with his passing so I've tried to ignore it but he even used to do this when his father was around too and his father approved of it because it was his home too and he should be able to just rock up whenever he needs an escape. I didn't like it then but I hate it now. I live alone with my 13 month old daughter and someone having such unrestricted access to my home just drives my anxiety up. Now before calling the police I need to check whether it's Bo or some crackhead intruder when I hear random noises.\n\nI told Bo that he just can't do this anymore and that he would have to not only notify me but actually ask me first before coming over. I would always say yes but just that respect of asking. He just stared me and told me that it was his home and his dad's house and that his dad always let him come and go as he wished so I must just 'live'. After that I went to get all the locks changed for the main house and his room outside then installed a security system. This past Friday night Bo came over and somehow still got inside his room but triggered the alarm. He messaged me saying it was just him and asked for the password so he could switch it off. I was on my way back home from out of town so I didn't see his message or his missed call until the I got the call from the security company from my house. The security company came over armed and were very aggressive with him which sent him into a panic attack. Now Bo has blocked me on everything and his sister has told me that he's not okay and that what happened triggered some gun trauma he had. I feel like shit now and wondering if I made a bad call here? Especially since I didn't tell him about the lock changes and security system.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
