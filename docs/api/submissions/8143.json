I've devoted my life to this man. I trust him and he trusts me, and I know he's a truthful man. So when he told me that a friend of ours (F24) asked to be driven out of state, I didn't mind at all. They were actually asking me to join, too, but I had to be at work because I already took too many sick leaves. He was going to be gone for a week and considering I have been out of state for a month to see family before, that was nothing. I also okayed it since that man never takes time off for myself.\n\nSo the week goes by and things are good. I call him every morning before work then at night after. Sometimes he texts me while I'm working but I try to text back when I'm not too busy. He's having a good time and I'm happy that he's doing good. When he gets back, stuff is normal.\n\nNow here we are today. I wake up and I get LONG texts from our friend and I was really worried. I read through it and it feels like my soul left my body when I saw that in the week they were together, they were sleeping together. The text was a whole apology, and I don't know if I forgive her, but I at least appreciate she wanted to confess. My fiance is awake by the time I wake up too so I find him in the kitchen and confront him.\n\nHe's immediately in denial when I bring up cheating but I show him the texts that our friend sent. He doesn't get angry often so I was shocked when he started telling me that he loves me but I didn't check up on him enough during that week and that I should have been following what they were doing. He said that our friend seduced him so well that he couldn't help himself. He was calling me some awful things I don't think I can post here. He left the house for now and I don't want to know where he is.\n\n I took time off work today and I'm still pretty overwhelmed. I feel like such a big part of my life is a lie now. But at the same time I don't know what I've done. Any time not at work has always been time for him.

The Deny, Attack, and Reverse the order of Victim and Offender. That's all he's doing with his complaint that you didn't \"check-up enough\". Ignore his attempts at manipulation.

It was a week. A WEEK. You\u2019re telling me this guy can\u2019t survive with low contact for a week? That doesn\u2019t seem like a sustainable relationship if he needs that much attention to prevent him from doing the most basic part of a monogamous relationship. \nYou don\u2019t owe your \u201cfriend\u201d any level of forgiveness or friendship anymore. Just because people apologize it doesn\u2019t mean they A. mean it or B. you have to accept it.

Honey, he's gaslighting you and blaming the person that told the truth. He is toxic and you should get out of the relationship asap. I can only imagine what else he blames on you.", "NTA.  You did nothing wrong. They decided to cheat.  They BOTH decided that this was an ok thing to do. You now need to decide how to go forward with your life. (He\u2019s not sorry and he will do it again).", "The only AH here is your partner. You are totally NTA. Don't let him gaslight you into believing otherwise. His excuses are that of a typical abuser, so don't blame yourself for this. You can't control what he does, nor babysit him all the time in order for him not to cheat on you. That's no way of living.", "God dam this is some of the most impressive gaslighting I've ever read.", "NTA. Make him an ex fianc\u00e9 like yesterday", "NTA...none of this in any way is your fault. The trust is gone. He's not even sorry. How you move forward is up to you.", "How are you AH?

Typical response from a person who feels no remorse for their behavior. As a woman who was cheated on 3 times and abused by her husband RUN! You didn't deserve this. You have done NOTHING to deserve this & it is NOT your fault. He does not deserve you or your love & loyalty. This will never get better.  He feels no remorse for his actions and will always blame you. This is NOT a good way to live. You deserve better than this! Way better!", "NTA.\n\nA real man doesn\u2019t need to be checked up on in order to keep it in his pants. You are not IN ANY WAY responsible for the choices he and your so-called friend made.", "NTA!!! He is gaslighting you! He is a grown adult that knows right from wrong. He is trying to shift the blame in you, when it is all in himself!! Also if he called you names when confronted with a HUGE wrong he did, BIG RED FLAG!!!", "Of course you are NTA.\nYour fianc\u00e9 however\u2026\nHe cheated on you, lied about it until confronted with proof then blamed his affair partner and you.\nHe is trying (apparently successfully) to distract you from the fact that *he* chose to be unfaithful and to lie about it, and his trying to blame you is disgusting behaviour.\nEven if he felt you could have contacted him more, that\u2019s not an excuse. I f she came on to him, he had to the option to say no. He chose not to, which is 100% on him.\nHe had the opportunity to decide he no longer wanted to be in a relationship with you, and to start one with her instead, a decent person would have told you it was over. He chose not to. That\u2019s 100% on him.\nYou are NTA. If he wanted to stay in closer contact with you during the trip he could have taken steps to do that. He\u2019s trying to make you think you are responsible for his choices and for carrying the sole responsibility for keeping in contact while you were apart, and that\u2019s bullshit.\nIf you want to try to salvage this relationship then I would suggest you look at couples counselling and perhaps individual therapy as well, but unless he is interested in trying to get back together AND willing to take responsibility for his own actions then neither counselling, nor the relationship, ox going to work.\nRight now, it seems that he isn\u2019t sorry for having cheated on you, he\u2019s only sorry that he got caught, and he\u2019s blaming everyone except himself.", "NTA he is the only responsible for his actions, you did nothing wrong. He is going to cheat on you again and he is going to blame you again, do a favor to yourself and leave him. Is going to be hard but is going to worth it", "NTA. What else did he expect you to do other than calling him? Install cameras where they were staying so you can see if they are up to something? Leave right away.", "YTA for making this man your life. No person should be your life\nThat being said, he cheated, lied, gaslite  you and trust me probably cheated a ton of times and since your so blind trusting him, you never saw it. Grow up, leave him. The pain is horrible but will go away", "Maybe, the only part you would be guilty of is lack of communication or not giving him enough attention. \n\nEven if that was the case, what he had done cannot be excused by any reason. If he was feeling left out, ignored, etc, he could have told you about it. That's what mature people do, discuss. Cheating on you and then blaming you is something that doesn't involve you. He had done it and he has to face the consequences.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

But when the words \"so what you think about us taking things further\" as she tried to take my hand under her blouse came out her mouth.

Sadly, it does not bode well for the rest of your relationship, especially if he's been gaslighting you since he found out that you knew.", "NTA. He cheated, he's now lying about it and gaslighting you about it. When the first word out of their mouths is a lie, assume that everything else that follows is too. Your friend didn't seduce him, but rather the other way around (wouldn't even surprise me to find out he got the friend drunk and/or high). \n\nI don't know if you can salvage a relationship with the friend. I personally wouldn't be able to, but that's me. If you want more details on specifics for closure, I'd ask her as she seems to be the reliable party here.

You deserve better. NTA", "NTA WTF he actually blamed you??? I am so sorry OP. Here I was thinking that you checked in too much. Gotta let your man miss you.

He made his choice and you had nothing to do with that.   The fact that is was happening over multiple days is the key.  It wasn't a 'mistake' he wanted it.
