This isn't the kind of thing that stays contained. Your kids have noticed. The four year old you have has noticed. This has affected them. You don't know what's she's said to them when you weren't there.\n\nYou didn't break your vows. She's using DARVO to make you look like the bad guy. She's making you responsible for herself so she doesn't look crazy. She's emotionally abusing you.\n\nShe doesn't want a child. She wants an emotional support animal. If she's acting like this, you have no idea what'll happen if the baby doesn't act the way she wants it to. \n\nThis is a giant ass red flag. Either get her medical help or get divorced over not having another kid  because this is insane.", "Putting her grief on a child, and expectations that a CHILD could be the cure to depression, a CHILD could have the responsibility of 'curing' Mom,  is not sane. Someone should talk to her doctor, she needs therapy, not 18 more years of childcare. You need to be the strong one in this. NO.", "nooooo!  don't do it", "And, the financial cost to do the reversal, plus the cost of another kid. \nI was at work the other day and overheard 2 people talking about their kids. The guy says \"yeah so x kid wants to go to college next year, so I told him to figure it out now, I've got 7 other kids, I can't pay for his college\". \nAnd I just think, ya know, another of people only have 1 or 2 kids and can't afford it.. but damn, OP is already considering financial implications...with 5 already.", "She needs therapy. \n\nAnd has she stopped to consider that 5 kids and a husband are enough people to focus her love on?\n\nShe is using her grief to manipulate you into another kid, reversing a decision you both made and you followed through on surgically, with complete disregard for your feelings. Not great!", "Op please read this comment. \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "Here\u2019s what I don\u2019t get\u2026 the youngest is 4, her first parent passed away four years ago, isn\u2019t that already her grief baby?", "Yeah - get a dog or something, not a kid, if she is seriously unable to quell her desire to \"focus her love\".", "Absolutely.", "Agree. Grief counseling is such an important part of living.", "They don't even stick.", "That was my thought, too.  Maybe less for the grief part but the number of people I know (including me, lol) who got a puppy when their youngest kid started kindergarten or 1st grade is pretty high.  Like, we still wanted something small and cute to nurture but weren't up for another human.", "Oh god don\u2019t get a pet to fix your wife\u2019s grief, OP.", "I\u2019m just sitting here thinking about the fact that I have a mom that isn\u2019t dead, but isn\u2019t good at being an emotionally available mother. I went through grief at not having a supportive mom for my pregnancies. But having 5 healthy pregnancies and a supportive mom and then to get reminded that she isn\u2019t here to support you is a one way ticket to ppd.", "This. \ud83d\udc46", "1- You werent thrilled with #4.\n\n2- You didn\u2019t actually want #5.\n\n3- You dont want #6, but you\u2019re \u201cconsidering it\u201d and saying \u201clet\u2019s do it\u201d, to\u2026 i dunno? Shut her up? Make her happy even if it makes yiu miserable (which is always a great thing for a kid)?\n\nWhat is wrong with you? GROW A SPINE AND DO NOT LET HER MANIPULATE YOU. \n\nWhat she\u2019s suggesting is VERY unhealthy for a future child. And YOU don\u2019t want it. STICK TO YOUR DECISION.\n\nThe best you can do is to find help for your wife. She needs grief counselling NOW, and she DOESNT need a bandaid-kid.", "not to bring up a terrible situation either, but what if their baby was sick, or god forbid miscarriage, etc. then what happens? if she is depending solely on this baby to cure her grief without going to therapy or getting some sort of help, its only going to worsen the situation.", "Uh yeah, she can't focus on the kids she already has??", "OMG THIS.  Yes.", "No, a dog is also a serious commitment of 12-18 years, and one should not make that decision while grieving.", "They're often sticky tho, at least while young.", "XD XD XD", "That\u2019s a real thing? An ESA could be good for this woman", "I do tend to agree. Although I think I would definitely leave a full discussion to OP as they know their wife and the details of the situation. I know that everyone handles grief differently and they said their wife's last parent passed \"in 2022\" but not when in 2022. I know when my dad passed there was a significant difference in my grief one year after his passing and two years after his passing."]}
