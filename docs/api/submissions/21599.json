Where does he say he thinks he might be going crazy?\n\nI'm not stupid, but you clearly are. You may have copy & pasted the definition but you obviously don't understand it. Again, please explain how the GF saying OP doesn't prioritize her makes him question his own sanity. \n\nWhats happening here is you're wrong & trying to convince me that you're right. OMG stop gaslighting me! \ud83d\ude44", "Please explain then. How is it not a psychological manipulation?", "Nope, it says psychological methods. You don\u2019t get to pick and choose what psychological methods counts as gaslighting.", "Are you also saying that didn\u2019t change his power of reasoning?", "manipulation isn\u2019t what\u2019s missing here, it\u2019s the questioning their own reality part. gaslighting is a type of psychological manipulation, not all psychological manipulation is gaslighting.", "No, it did not effect his ability to think logically. You're really grasping at straws here. Just give it up.", "Did it not interrupt his power of reasoning? I\u2019m going to say it did or he wouldn\u2019t be asking this on AITA\u2026.", "Idk why people are not seeing the gfs side at all. The family doesn\u2019t want her at a wedding, which would hurt if you were already expecting to go for a long time. No one\u2019s an ah but maybe comfort your girlfriend and still find a way to go to the wedding.", "YTA for not going. Are you absolutely sure she is 29 and not 19?", "YTA and so is the family\n\nYou invited her and she made plans to go. To pull the takeback nonsense is pretty much bullshit\n\nYour mom should have talked to the cousin since she was the one who told you to invite her.", "NTA. She wasn't *un*invited, she *wasn't* invited. You should have gone to the wedding, and if she's going to be that childish, you may want to rethink your relationship.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re girlfriend needs \u2026. To grow up. \n\nHonestly I would really think long and hard about wanting to stay in a relationship with someone so disrespectful. She insulted you and your mother all because of an honest misunderstanding about a wedding invitation. \n\nAlso this should -never- of been a fight in the first place. She\u2019s allowed to be disappointed but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t go any more or that you \u201caren\u2019t prioritizing her.\u201d \n\nYou should go. It\u2019s a once in a lifetime event (for most people) and you\u2019ll get to see people who matter to you. If she\u2019s going to throw this huge stink over it then she probably isn\u2019t girlfriend material. \n\nAlso the disrespectful behaviour and continuing a fight for weeks shows that she\u2019s used to bullying people to get her own way regardless of other people and their feelings. She\u2019s going to continue this awful behaviour for the entirety of your relationship.", "YIKES!\n\nNTA but be very wary of this girl.", "Nta.   Gf not being invited was not a personal slight since no +1's were invited..  It's very sad that you missed the event bc of your gf's immature tandrum.  Be very very careful if you plan to marry the gf - she seems very controlling.", "Nta. Get away from her.", "Why the hell was your invitation sent to your mother?", "Don't invite people if they can't bring a plus one. This is a stupid wedding idea.", "NTA.  Your mother gave you the incorrect info, you didn't \"uninvite\" her.  She was seriously upset for WEEKS over this? Wow...", "NTA. Also, how does a simple misunderstanding like that take *weeks* to resolve?!?", "NTA. If my girlfriend was in your place, I would understand and wish her a good time at the wedding.", "NTA. She\u2019s overreacting", "Just so you know, especially for wedding invitations: only the names written on the envelope are invited. If there is no note inside indicating a plus one then you don\u2019t get one. \n\nThis is standard, timeless wedding etiquette. Name not on invite, you\u2019re not invited. \n\nYou mother misunderstood and your GF is being ridiculous. She\u2019s 29. I\u2019m sure she has had multiple friend wedding by now. She need to learn her manners. NTA.", "I think more details are needed here. How long have you been with your GF? I\u2019ve been the gf that wasn\u2019t invited to a wedding after being with my SO for 4+ years. It hurts and is absolutely offensive. I\u2019m going to go with ESH (especially your mom). Gf might have overreacted depending on the above details, mom was wrong to have extended an invite to something she had no details on, and it sounds like you weren\u2019t being overly sensitive to how hurtful the situation likely was to your GF.", "NTA. Go to the wedding.", "NTA\n\nThis is a good lesson for future tough interactions with this lady. I'd be wondering if I want to hitch my wagon with her. You're a man, you'll always be able to father children. Think hard about restarting with another female. If you want to stay, have a frank talk with her. I don't think it's cool to name call under any circumstances. You're not the A hole here, she is.", "NTA\u2026 this is a glimpse of your future life", "NTA. \n1. Your mom never should have assumed there were plus ones. \n\n2. You should have received your own invite, since you're not a kid living at home. \n\n3. And your GF was the AH here for her reaction. That level of controlling, dramatic behavior is never a sign of a good relationship.", "NTA\n\nit was an error not an un-invite.", "NTA. Good reason to keep her at an arms length as Girlfriend rather than wife.", "NTA. Your gf is on the staircase to being an abusive AH. She's blaming you for a simple miscommunication that was only an issue for two weeks. Unless she bought some super expensive dress, it should have been a funny story to tell people.", "NTA.. your gf sound exhausting.. and really lame not to invite plus ones..", "NTA\nGf is being a huge AH though.\nWow, a simple misunderstanding was a good opportunity to be gracious, instead she went to war. \nThis is not a good sign. Poor you, your poor mom.", "Your girlfriend needs to grow up.  Can\u2019t she stand seeing you have fun without her?", "NTA. Your mom has no control over who the bride and groom invite and she thought your gf should come before knowing that she wasn\u2019t invited. You all aren\u2019t married and no one is getting a +1 so it\u2019s not like your family is doing anything specifically against your gf.", "NTA. She might be showing those true colors...also, you didn't go? Gotta have a backbone", "NTA- you're a mama's boy for wanting to attend a wedding and see some of your family? That's quite a stretch.", "GF seems over dramatic but how long have you two been dating?  If you'd been together for more than a year I could see her point...she's now 'cemented' as your significant other.  That said...seems like you put yourself through a lot of grief over a cousin's wedding.", "NTA at all. I had a plus one to my aunt's wedding & no +1 to my cousin's wedding. I brought my wife to the first & she had no issue not going to latter. She understood how it is, clearly your gf doesn't", "OP as a 31 yo adult should have received their own invitation. Something here is missing or just messed up.", "NTA. She\u2019s being a freak", "GF controlling AF.", "NTA. Go to your cousin's wedding and see your family.", "GF is clearly drunk on the JNMIL Kool Aid and has lost any possible perspective. Anything doesn't go her way?

There's no need to put you down.", "If she can't see how a misunderstanding like that can happen, and throws this kind of fit over it, then she doesn't care about you, or your family.", "Also the disrespectful behaviour and continuing a fight for weeks shows that she\u2019s used to bullying people to get her own way regardless of other people and their feelings.", "Most sane people would be relieved that they got out of it. Sounds like she does not trust you at all.", " It may not be gaslighting but it certainly is something else.", "This is the truth! Family will have your back, and until the girlfriend is family, tough. Especially with that attitude.", "This is a very reasonable assumption tbh. I've noticed a severe uptick in people who WANT a justno so badly they'll create issues out of nothing with the increase in Jnmil members.

If she didn\u2019t like the GF, she wouldn\u2019t mention it in the first place. She made an assumption and was wrong, I think.", "Admittedly I love weddings and would be bummed not to go, but the way she lashed out was absolutely unacceptable. The most aggressive response this situation warranted would be, \u201caww, that\u2019s a shame. I really wanted to meet your family and/or go out dancing [depending on what the draw was].
