I tried my best to have a calm conversation and point out if roles were switched I would absolutely be fine with her going, but that didn\u2019t work. Problem also is she\u2019s talked with her friends about this and they all support her, but I have no idea what story she has told them.

If it was that important for her to attend to at least see them get married etc you could ask your family if your gf could attend the ceremony part of the wedding which wouldn't cost them any extra & she still gets to be a part of it.

Even if you're still living with your mom for whatever reason you should have gotten your own...your adult siblings too.  In my opinion the cousin fucked up too by not knowing the extent of wedding invite etiquette. If it had been sent to you directly and you had opened it you might have noticed that GF wasn't included and asked the cousin or your aunt or someone if she was allowed or not before inviting her.\n\nNow, the fact that GF is being a brat because she can't go and your still plan to attend a family wedding without her is another thing entirely.", "Lol nta but I also out of curiosity wanna throw a INFO?
