The miscommunication was unfortunate but happens. At end of day; it\u2019s the bride and groom decision who to invite and while you shouldn\u2019t have told her without checking; she seems to reacting extremely. Any woman who thinks you attending a family wedding is not prioritizing her is toxic. Unless she has a personal event or similar that she needs you to be at during same time - there is no reason this should be causing this much drama. Why doesn\u2019t she trust you around your own family? Why are you going to let her alienate you from your family? This seems like an overreaction with control as the only goal on her part. I\u2019d let her know that you will be going to your family wedding and offer a compromise like a weekend trip or something for just the two of you before or after event so she still feels valued but don\u2019t let her dictate when you see your own family.", "NTA.

There was a misunderstanding and she acted very badly.

Your mom made a mistake encouraging you to invite your gfriend. Mistakes happen. Yes, you should attend the event and visit with family and folks who have been in your life. Her not attending is not a personal insult; weddings are expensive and many couples have strict budgets to adhere to.\n\nHer reaction was extreme. There's no need to put you down. What will be the next topic that causes her to 'lose it'?  This will likely occur again so decide what you want in life.", "NTA. It was a misunderstanding, and she was never invited. How is going to a family wedding disrespecting her? This doesn\u2019t seem reasonable or healthy.", "Your girlfriend is being childish.  Go to your cousin's wedding.

That is one irrational reaction. So many red flags.", "NTA and that\u2019s a big red flag\n\nWeddings are expensive, plus 1s don\u2019t always work.

Is it typical in your family for only the parent to receive the invitation? Where im at, if you live separately,  it is expected you receive your own invitation and it not be included on Mommy and Daddy's invitation like you were still a child.", "She overreacted but YTA for inviting someone without checking with the couple getting married first...", "Im curious if there\u2019s more to this story?

That didn\u2019t specify a plus one? I would\u2019ve been skeptical if I were her to begin with so I don\u2019t see why she\u2019s acting crazy. I think you\u2019re all te AH here", "NTA- sounds like there\u2019s far more to this that leads to her reacting this way. Consider if you are choosing your mom over her far more often than just this occasion. If your mom is very actively in control of your adult life, & meddling in your relationship, then your GF is not wrong, just went about it wrong. \n\nYou need to look at the bigger picture than just this wedding invitation situation", "Esh.  Inviting and uninviting sucks.  And that is on your mom and you.   Your girlfriend should have still let you go but demanded other ways of making it up to her including assurances that you'd be extra careful to make sure this doesn't happen again.  Maybe an extra special date or something  too.  Those things.\n\nBack to how you and your mom messed up.  When my SO and I were early on with dating.  His cousin had a wedding.  I asked if I could go to.  He asked his mom.  Who asked her sibling/cousin's parent.  In the end I could and did.  But I wasn't going to get upset at a no.  This should have been how everyone acted instead.  You and your mom should have asked the  ones more involved in the wedding before Inviting your gf.  And if it was no, she should have been okay.", "Sorry but you are a mama's boy. Why are you not getting the invite yourself? I'd be upset with you also.

It must've been upsetting given a few months before hand she wasn't going to go. I supposed she felt honoured to be invited and for it to be snatched away a massive reaction came and she was lashing out at anything and anyone. I'm not saying she's bad but maybe hurt and hopefully with some introspection on her part she could come to realise that not only was her reaction out of order but also that you're clearly serious about the relationship and maybe it's opened her eyes to you being literally husband material as evidence by the commitment to her you've shown. A apology is in order from various parties here not because people are at fault purposely but just as a sign that mistakes can be made and civility and love is still present. I'm just sorry that you missed this chance to attend a wedding.\n\nJust to edit that I don't believe you should be apologising here.
