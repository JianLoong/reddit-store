We have known each other for like 8 years now, we were friends so we have a lot of friends in common. She's 6 weeks pregnant. \n\nWe haven't told anyone about the pregnancy yet, she wants to wait a bit more, everything's good so far but her family has some history of miscarriages so she wants to wait a bit till we give the big news to our families and friends. \n\nOur friend (m29) birthday was yesterday, he wanted to go get some sushi, obviously the smell is too strong there and fish has been making her sick so we don't have it at home anymore. So I asked her if she wanted to go or not, we could make up a little lie and skip the dinner if she was uncomfortable or something, she said she was fine and we could go. So we confirmed to our friend.\n\nWe went to the restaurant and as I said the smell in those places is strong, she was hiding it quite well honestly. Well when we were eating she said she wanted to get some air, I went outside with her, she told me she was getting very sick and she wanted to leave. I told her okay, we should pay our part of the bill and say goodbye. We went back to our table and said that she was feeling a bit sick because of her period (it's something that happens actually, so it was believable) we were saying out goodbyes when another friend wanted to show me something in her phone, so I started chatting with her about it\n\nMaybe I took too long, I honestly don't know, we were talking for a bit, she tried to tell me if we can go now a couple times but as I was talking with this friend I told her to let me finish this and we'll leave. Well she got tired of it and told everyone she's leaving and told me to get a taxi home. I told her to wait for a bit but she left. \n\nI finished talking to my friend about her trip and decided to go home. \n\nWhen I got home she was in bed, so I went over to her and asked her if she's feeling better. She didn't answer, so I asked if everything was okay. She ignored me again do I went over to her and asked what's going on once again, then she blew off at me and told me off for leaving her waiting and making her drive home alone. I told her the chat with our friend was important so she could've waited a bit in the car or something as I left some minutes after she did. She told me she was tired of waiting and was about to puke in the middle of the sushi bar, she couldn't wait anymore. We argued then she told me to leave her alone. This morning she was giving me the cold shoulder too. AITA? I feel like she could've waited a bit more", "created_utc": 1684961638, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qxds5/aita_for_not_leaving_the_restaurant_with_my/", "score": 1042, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her being ill required immediate attention.  Your friend's story did not.", "YTA.  Your child was making her want to hurl and you wouldn't leave your friend chatting about her phone.  Dude.  From what perspective are you possibly not an AH?", "i'm confused as to what conversation is more important than your pregnant SO being sick?  i'm also confused as to why you would say \"i feel like she could've waited a bit more\" when she told you she had to leave immediately, and asked you more than once to leave once you started having his \"important conversation\".   YTA", "YTA\n\nShe was feeling very sick and told you about it so you should have said your goodbyes and left immediately. Then she has to ask you more times to leave as you just sat there talking to your friend about a trip. You should have understood the urgency of the situation and left with her instead of expecting her to sit there and wait for you. \n\nWhy did you think talking to your friend about some trip was more important than supporting your girlfriend who\u2019s pregnant and feeling sick? She definitely deserves a huge apology", "YTA.  Will you tell your sick child to wait so that you can finish a (completely unimportant) conversation with a friend?  I hope not.", "YTA\n\nTake it as someone who couldn't handle the smell of fish when pregnant & had morning sickness.\n\nThe woman has no control, when the baby doesn't like something, smells are overpowering or you just don't feel well. You don't get the option to hold off.\n\nYou can't schedule you'll be sick in 10 minutes time, you have no option.\n\nAnd telling them that she was sick because she is on her period is an asshole move too. A man doesn't justify why their being sick so why does a woman how to?!\n\nAnd your wondering why she's pissed off....", "YTA because of your dismissiveness. Your replies to another Redditor stated you were taking about doing research on a trip you\u2019ll be taking in a few weeks. \n\nThis is something that could\u2019ve waited. You prioritized someone else over her. You\u2019re either not understanding or willingly being obtuse about this.", "YTA and you let her down. She will now see you as unreliable, and will likely hold this against you.", "YTA. You should have said, \"I'm sorry, can you show me this another time? I really need to take her home.\"", "YTA\n\nWhen someone feels like they are going to be sick they feel like they are going to be sick right that very moment.  Not in 5 minutes.  Not in 10 minutes.  NOW.\n\nAnd it is a disgusting miserable feeling.\n\nShe couldn't wait.  She shouldn't have waited.  The right thing to do was apologize and leave as quickly as you could so she could get someplace where should could be sick comfortably. \n\nAnd as an FYI morning sickness doesn't get to the peak of bad until 8 - 12 weeks so if she is sick now you might want to buckle up.", ">I told her the chat with our friend was important\n\nlol, no it wasn't.", "YTA\n\nYou and gf came to an agreement that is was time to go. Then, you decided to chat with a friend, soooo long, that gf waited, asked multiple times to leave, got fed up and left, made it all the way home, got ready for bed, and got in bed. That's exceptionally too long under normal circumstances, and you knew she was unwell.", "YTA. The smell was literally making her sick. If she had enough time to get ready for bed, you were more than a couple minutes behind her.", "YTA\nYour gf is pregnant...doing the hard job, the hormones being a thousand, her body being change...your job it s only support her and giving atencion...", "YTA. If she felt sick enough to leave in the middle of the meal, waiting a little bit isn't an option. I can't relate to feeling sick from strong smells while pregnant, but I can relate to the feeling of strong smells making me feel sick when I'm experiencing a migraine. Even after getting away from it, feeling sick doesn't immediately go away either. It's not pleasant, all you want to do is get away from it, go home, go to bed, and pray it doesn't make you hurl. \n\n\"Maybe I took too long, I honestly don't know...\" You do know. You did take too long. You were going to leave with her when she began feeling sick, and then had a conversation that could have happened later on. She felt sick, she wanted to go home, not sit in a car waiting for you to finish a conversation that could happen at any point later on.\n\nMaybe be a little more considerate. I mean, dude, she's pregnant with your child.", "Yta. When a nauseous pregnant woman says it's time to go, it's time to go. It's like when a toddler says they have to pee.  They don't mean in 20 minutes.  They mean NOW. Your friends trip was NOT more important.", "Dude. YTA. You know that, when the baby comes, it won\u2019t be about you anymore?", "YTA", "YTA. You're deflecting blame and you told your girlfriend that talking to your friend was important implying that it was more important than your girlfriend's well-being. Your girlfriend was about to throw up, and she had to ask you multiple times to leave, and yet you think she could've waited more.", "yeah YTA, can't even believe you had to ask", "YTA\n\nYou really had to ask?", "YTA \n\nDid you want her to barf in the middle of the restaurant? How about all over in the car? Come on. She wouldn\u2019t have said it was urgent for her to leave soon if it wasn\u2019t urgent", "YTA. You said yourself that you don't know if you took too long and that she asked multiple times if you could leave. Why couldn't you say to your friend that you'd love to catch up and discuss the trip but girlfriend was really feeling ill so you'd call them to set up a coffee or lunch meet up? Even after she told you she was leaving you still sat there discussing your friends vacation instead if apologizing and seeing the woman who you supposedly love that happens to be carrying your child back home. You dropped the ball big time on this and you need to do some serious apologizing. Hopefully you don't make a habit of putting her needs last.", "YTA she needs to leave your ass", "I had very mild morning sickness and, honestly, it isn't something you can \"wait a bit\" over. You'd agreed to go. You had said goodbye, and then something on someone's phone distracted you (was more important than your pregnant partner's comfort-thats how gf will see it).", "YTA. You are most definitely the asshole, your girlfriend, mind you pregnant girlfriend, was in distress and asked to leave multiple times so much so that she left without you. If I were you I would reconsider my priorities and apologize to your girlfriend.", "Yta. Your partner is pregnant. Put her first over conversations and the like", "I would literally have an abobo and go. If you won't take care of her this early on with something so small...may awareness be with her.  Yta big time.", "YTA\n\nIf she is do ill that she needs to leave, she\u2019s ill. She can\u2019t wait, she told you that she needed to leave. And instead you stood around chatting. \n\nIf you were fighting not to puke with every breath would you have still wanted to stand and chat with your friend? Or would you have said you\u2019d catch up later and made sure you left before you burned everywhere??\n\nBecause it wasn\u2019t you that felt sick you decided it didn\u2019t really matter. How is that the act of a caring partner?", "If pregnant women says \u201c time to go\u201d it\u2019s time to go.\nIt\u2019s actually unsafe you let her drive when she is about to puke. She is not feeling well.\nYou are fully AH.\n\nYTA", "asshole", "The chat with my friend was important --- really? Was it? Couldn't have been handled later?\n\nYTA", "YTA you were selfish and talking to your friend about the trip could have waited. Growing a tiny human is hard work and nobody wants to sit in a restaurant feeling like they are going to throw up. Your about to have a child it's time to griw up and put someone else's needs before your own", "Yta. I hope she finds someone more caring.", "YTA", "YTA. She gave you plenty of warning that she was feeling unwell and needed to leave but you decided to ignore her. Good for her for leaving your sorry ass at the restaurant.", "YTA, she\u2019s literally pregnant! She\u2019s sick! When it comes to pregnancy nothing can \u201cwait\u201d! The smell was already a known trigger for her sickness too!", "YTA\n\nShe is carrying your child. You need to step up and put her first. That means above all friends and trips. Do you plan to have this baby with her? If so, start doing better now.", "Ok OP I am going to save you some future headaches.  \n\nHere is a list of things that can not wait for you to finish talking to a colleague or friend.  \n\nA policeman pulling you over\nA fire\nYour pregnant so feeling ill\nYour heavily pregnant wife needing to sit down or pee\nYour wedding on the day of\nYour pregnant so going into labor\nYour child touching a stove\nYour child playing with knives or plastic bags or anything breakable and electronic \nYour child eating something toxic or choke able\nYour toddler needing to pee", "YTA because she needed to leave, you told people she was on her period, repeatedly brushed her off... and was your friend who went on a trip perhaps showing you bathing suit pics on her phone?", "YTA\n\nshe's pregnant. she was feeling ill to the point where she was afraid she was going to vomit on the spot. your friend's phone and photos were far more important than her. \n\nso, yes. you are the asshole. completely and utterly. you need to apologize.", "YTA. \n\nI see your comments repeating \"we got carried away,\" but you should probably stop that as that's just a lie. You didn't accidentally lose track of time because your girlfriend was constantly asking for you both to leave, and you deliberately chose to ignore her. \n\nAnd the worst part about this is that YOU are the reason she's getting sick. YOUR baby is causing her aversion to the smell of sushi. That woman is going to go through nine months of absolute hell and then have to push an entire human out of her body and you treated her like garbage. You should be worshipping the ground she walks on right now. You say this is a one time thing, but you have no idea that you have just planted the inkling in her head that you don't care about her wellbeing when she's in the most vulnerable part of her life. She may not leave you over this one situation, but sometimes an inkling is all it takes for the dominoes to start aligning, and if you continue like this, they will fall. \n\nDo better.", "YTA. By the way, pregnant women shouldn\u2019t eat sushi.", "You admit you got carried away and lost track of time. How does that not require an apology to your girlfriend? Have you ever been nauseous? Definitely haven\u2019t been nauseous and pregnant.  Sitting in a car doesn\u2019t make that better. Honestly your friend seems extremely rude too if she hear you explain why you were leaving and then stopped to have a conversation that you already planned to have at a later date. \n\nI get that the topic excited you and I get that you didn\u2019t realize how much time had passed, but it did and here you are and you owe an apology. You don\u2019t have a leg to stand on here and delaying this is making it worse. You made a mistake. Apologize for goodness sake. Why are you dragging this out? You have zero idea how it feels to be pregnant and sick so you can feel she should have waited longer all you want but even if she wasn\u2019t sick, if you have said your goodbyes and are leaving, starting a new conversation that lasts longer than \u2018I would love to catch up. Can I text you this week?\u2019 is rude and you and the friend owe her an apology", "YTA. She was sick. You putzed around and basically ignored her needs. She is carrying your child, and pregnancy nausea is utterly miserable. You were absolutely the AH.", "You prioritized looking at your friends phone over your very ill girlfriend who needed to throw up.   You were a very selfish, self centered AH!    When someone is very ill and has to vomit you need to leave immediately.\n\nYTA", "..... You can't be so seriously dense. Of course YTA.", "Ooooooooh boy. YTA majorly!!!!!!!! You have SO much to learn about pregnancy. Read a book. Get on the internet. Listen to your girlfriend. This will rock. your. worlds. \n\nWhen she says move, you MOVE, dude. Life will never wait for you to finish stupid conversations again. \n\nGood luck - and you\u2019d better turn this around, FAST.", "YTA    does she have to puke on you before you realize when she said she wants to leave now, she meant now?", "I see that in comments you finally admitted that it was a mistake. \n\nBuy it wasn't a mistake. It was a series of choices you made to disregard your girlfriend's needs and comfort. \n\nAlso, that's your kid. She didn't get pregnant by immaculate conception. If you're going to be this selfish, she's going to have a much harder road ahead. \n\nI really feel for your girlfriend.

It was all about you when it should be about HER.", "hey OP, how long between your GF leaving and you getting home occurred? You said she was in bed when you got back so that feels like a decent amount of time. \n\nYou don't get to decide how in a rush a pregnant person who is currently ill is. \n\nOh yea, YTA.", "YTA - and this long post of yours still doesn\u2019t excuse your behavior. She was sick!", "YTA", "You\u2019re an asshole.

I hope she heeds it. \n\nYTA", "On what planet are you not the asshole?!?

A fun conversation can wait another day.", "YTA.  Learn to prioritize.  You were being a selfish prick and your pregnant gf was sick.  Get over yourself.", "YTA and you have bad bad karma coming your way. I hope you get a case of explosive diarrhea and before you can get to the bathroom your girlfriend gets to have the same time talking about whatever project she has going on. You are acting like a shitty partner and you only have so much time before the baby comes to course correct or the restaurant won\u2019t be the only thing she leaves", "Dude, don't make a pregnant lady wait when she's feeling sick. Yes, YTA for not leaving when she left. Whatever you were doing with your friend could have waited.", "YTA  You made your pregnant girlfriend stand around in a place where you know the smells were making her sick. She tried different times to get you to go but you were having an important discussion looking at pictures (that I'm sure you wouldn't be able to look at later) about a trip they had been on. Ignoring the woman who you're supposed to care about carrying your child that you are supposed to care about therefore leaving her no choice but to drive her sick self home before she started being sick over everyone at the party. You'll be lucky if she ever speaks to you again after showing her that she and your child are the least important people in your life.", "YTA \u2014 when you go to say goodbyes because one of you is feeling ill you don\u2019t start up a whole new conversation, regardless of who initiated it, you cut it off, and go. \nYour partner was feeling ill, and needed to leave immediately, but you ignored her requesting to leave multiple times to continue a conversation that could have been picked up at a later time, and keep making excuses in the threads of this post.", "So the chat with your friend was more important than your pregnant gf that was sick and could've potentially puked.  Ok.\n\nIf I was your gf I would have puked in the drivers seat of your car, then took an Uber home.\n\nMorning sickness is no joke, so you might want to pull your head out of your ass before she really gets pissed off at you.  Morning sickness, and all other side affects of pregnancy can't be told to wait while you chat with a friend about super important stuff.\n\nGrow up. Maybe do some research on morning sickness. Apologize to your gf and admit that you are an idiot, and promise to never put somebody else before her.  Ever.\n\nYTA... and a huge one.", "YTA. Should she have puked all over the table?

Talking to your friend for a minute more -- that was way more than that -- is not more important than your GF carrying your child.

Right now you've just shown her you are unreliable and don't put anyone except yourself first.

I mentioned I felt sick but thought I just needed to sit down (my fault, not his) and then didn\u2019t realize until too late I was going to hurl. So I hurled in the Chinese buffet parking lot in front of his friend (and it was super gross) if I had told him that many times I was sick and needed to go he would have left.

We have known each other for like 8 years now, we were friends so we have a lot of friends in common. She's 6 weeks pregnant. \n\nWe haven't told anyone about the pregnancy yet, she wants to wait a bit more, everything's good so far but her family has some history of miscarriages so she wants to wait a bit till we give the big news to our families and friends. \n\nOur friend (m29) birthday was yesterday, he wanted to go get some sushi, obviously the smell is too strong there and fish has been making her sick so we don't have it at home anymore. So I asked her if she wanted to go or not, we could make up a little lie and skip the dinner if she was uncomfortable or something, she said she was fine and we could go. So we confirmed to our friend.\n\nWe went to the restaurant and as I said the smell in those places is strong, she was hiding it quite well honestly. Well when we were eating she said she wanted to get some air, I went outside with her, she told me she was getting very sick and she wanted to leave. I told her okay, we should pay our part of the bill and say goodbye. We went back to our table and said that she was feeling a bit sick because of her period (it's something that happens actually, so it was believable) we were saying out goodbyes when another friend wanted to show me something in her phone, so I started chatting with her about it\n\nMaybe I took too long, I honestly don't know, we were talking for a bit, she tried to tell me if we can go now a couple times but as I was talking with this friend I told her to let me finish this and we'll leave. Well she got tired of it and told everyone she's leaving and told me to get a taxi home. I told her to wait for a bit but she left. \n\nI finished talking to my friend about her trip and decided to go home. \n\nWhen I got home she was in bed, so I went over to her and asked her if she's feeling better. She didn't answer, so I asked if everything was okay. She ignored me again do I went over to her and asked what's going on once again, then she blew off at me and told me off for leaving her waiting and making her drive home alone. I told her the chat with our friend was important so she could've waited a bit in the car or something as I left some minutes after she did. She told me she was tired of waiting and was about to puke in the middle of the sushi bar, she couldn't wait anymore. We argued then she told me to leave her alone. This morning she was giving me the cold shoulder too. AITA? I feel like she could've waited a bit more\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can then spend all that free time looking at your friends phones.", "Ah, yes, I have fond memories of pregnancy.\n\nSo, first, I'm not holding anyone accountable because y'all probably didn't know, but it's not recommended for pregnant people to eat fish since mercury can harm the pregnancy. Sushi, especially, is on the no-no list.\n\nI'm gonna have to give you a YTA ruling. Smells suck when you're pregnant (I love the smell of gasoline, but during my pregnancy I couldn't even be in my car if I was pumping gas. I'd throw up every time. I'd have to wait in the store or not go and have someone else do it for me.), and it can make you very queasy. Truthfully you should have just left and told your friend that they'd have to show you later. Your girlfriend was probably suffering and begging you to go. You should have listened and respected her wishes. She's only six weeks now, but it's going to get a lot harder as the pregnancy goes.\n\nBefore I go, congrats on the pregnancy you guys! I recommend you get some pregnancy books like \"What to Expect when You're Expecting\", and talk to y'all's OBGYN about what she can and can't do. If y'all have cats, she can't change the litter box, so be respectful of that.", "YTA you are not showing your gf that you can be a supportive partner during this very difficult time for her. You showed her that a conversation that you had already scheduled time for later this week was more important than how she was feeling. You say you lost track of time but she told you multiple times that she needed to leave cause she was sick and pushed her feelings off to have your talk. Your talk was more important than your gf feeling ill. Than she had to drive while feeling ill and had time to get into bed before you got home despite you leaving minutes after her (your taxi excuse is weak). If my husband has done this during my pregnancies I would\u2019ve gone to stay with my parents until he could show me remorse. Your problem is you still don\u2019t think you did anything wrong or you wouldn\u2019t be arguing with everyone\u2019s verdict", "YTA and so is the friend who stopped you from leaving as you were saying goodbye.

End of story.", "YYA and judging by your comments ignorant and selfish. Every comment downplays how she was feeling (as if you\u2019d know).  When I had my son my sense of smell and nausea was so extreme I couldn\u2019t even step foot in a grocery store without being violently sick.  My husband started doing all the shopping without a single complaint. He\u2019s a teenager now and I still hate the smell.  Guess who\u2019s husband still does most of the shopping?

Then you can explain the situation later and catch-up later.\n\nYour excuses and what happened later don't matter.

Her and the baby come first and if you don\u2019t understand that then you need to be cut out of the picture.

Maybe we can get a coffee or something\u201d. Literally anything that says hey I am supporting you to gf. \n\nI think the largest issue here is that it\u2019s 6 weeks in, and your girlfriend is most likely going to get more sick and have more pregnancy adjustments, and she\u2019s not clear on how you will act with her through that. It\u2019s scary going into this change and feeling alone.", "YTA Jesus how do you feel when you\u2019re sick? Where do you want to be in bed or waiting to wrap up a pointless conversation. Grow up and do better!", "NTA \n\nThis will happen every now and then man don't beat yourself over the head. You two weren't on the same page that day and she made it back perfectly fine.

Quit justifying what you did and apologize to her.", "When I was pregnant, I hated the smell of garlic so much it makes me sick.

Multiple times. And now she's ignoring you like you ignored her! Turn about is fair play, a*hole.", "Wtf... no they don't.... wtf are you smoking.", "Why? Because you need to label someone as neurodivergent because you don't like how they're acting? Because all autistic people are arseholes? \n\nWtf is that supposed to achieve except to make other autistic people\n\n- who have nothing to do with this situation\n\n- Who try their hardest every day to mask their symptoms and manage their crippling social anxiety\n\nfeel awful? \n\nJust call an arsehole an arsehole and leave other people out of it.", "Key word LIKE not LOVE. the only reason why you're with your gf as you mentioned was \"we have alot in common\" no I love her because of this or that.

And the fact *she* kept talking while knowing your gf is sick is weird as hell. \n\nYou need to stop putting YOUR wants first and put your partner\u2019s needs first since she is literally carrying your child. You are 28 but you are acting 18. Tell her you\u2019re sorry and actually try to do better going forward.\n\n\nEdit: just saw a comment you made that you aren\u2019t at the \u201clove\u201d level with her. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s mostly you. Also, were you flirting with the friend showing you her photos? Was she also flirting with you while ignoring your gf?
