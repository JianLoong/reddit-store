I think you should suggest this and if he refuses that\u2019s his loss.", "NTA, the drinking like ofc you don't want a drunk person around a child and the smoking? Are they smoking indoors and the kid can breathe it in? If so, that would just be terrible for their health so definitely not the asshole. I get that they want to have their grandchild visit, but if they really want it they could do something other than sitting indoors and being drunk.", "NTA\n\nI would be most concerned about exposing my child to 2 people constantly smoking!\n\nYou need to lay down some ground rules, To be sober when your child visits, no drinking and smoking while she is there. Supervised visits only with you there", "NTA.\n\nyou get to decide what your child is exposed to regardless or what it is, who it is, or where it is. Tell them you will (I'm assuming you will here) be more than happy to get out and do something where your daughter won't have a front row seat to these activities. \n\nI told my own mother and father when my son son was born/young he would not be visiting either of their homes unless they quit smoking inside.

I do wonder you would be comfortable with shorter visits that are less frequent. I do agree with your point about \"not fun sitting around the house all day with a toddler.\" \n\nI wonder if there's a park near your parents? It's pretty traditional for grownups to sit on a park bench talking while kids run around. \n\nI guess I do have a bias that it's nice if kids can spend at least a little time with multiple generations of family, so I'm wishing that were possible even though I don't think you are an asshole for not liking the current dynamic and wouldn't be an asshole even if you don't take my suggestions.", "I remember being a kid while the adults drank beer and smoked.

You are trying to encourage healthier thought patterns and associations in her brain  whilst removing her from the presence of functional alcoholics who are poisoning a 3 year old with secondhand smoke.\n\nIf your father wants to spend time with his granddaughter, he can do it sober, without cigarettes, in a way that is positive for your daughter. If he won't do that, tough.", "[removed]", "I'm going to say a little bit YTA. \n\nIt feels unkind to keep him from his granddaughter completely just because he doesn't have the energy for outings. If you are concerned about the behaviors he is modeling with the drinking and smoking, I'd address those directly. \n\n What if you went to a playground with your daughter and then went by his place for pizza and a kid-appropriate movie afterwards?  If you ask them not to smoke with your daughter in their house are they willing to comply? Are they willing to cut the beer down to a level that you are comfortable with while you are there with your daughter? (I don't think it's terrible for a child to see an adult drinking alcohol if it's in reasonable quantity, but if you do, ask them if they would abstain from that as well.)  I think it's worth finding a way to include your father in her life, even if that can't be active outings.  And maybe if you start to compromise this way, you'll find he's also willing to meet you at the park to watch your daughter play before going back to his place for pizza or take out and TV or a movie. \n\nMaybe he (or you) could buy some appropriate toys to keep at his home -- possibly simple games he could play with his granddaughter.  I think it's worth the effort to work with him to find ways that he can be a positive part of your daughter's life.  You said she adores him.  Don't keep them apart.", "ESH. Grandpa should try to get her out of the house. You should lighten up on Grandpa. Of course secondhand smoke isn't good for the kid and they're not a good example.
