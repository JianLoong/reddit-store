I told her no again and apologized but I just don\u2019t want to help you buy something for someone that I barely know and she should just use the $10 she has to buy a small gift for her bf.

That money was for buying ***you*** a birthday gift, not her boyfriend.", "NTA. and he doesn\u2019t want a teddy bear. i\u2019d never buy a dude a teddy bear. especially a $40 one.", "NTA\nThat girl wants to spend your money so you won't have it. Naw, sis. Don't have that.", "One of the easiest NTA ever!\n\nEdit: if this is how your friend is going to act, i recommend you try to make a new one.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she didn\u2019t even pretend she was going to pay you back.\n\nAlso I doubt a 16yo guy wants a huge Hallmark teddy bear for his birthday.", "NTA.  You now have learned the wisdom of keeping your financial information private.  Your \u201cfriend\u201d and her flying monkeys have no right to demand money from you.", "NTA! And she's a terrible friend! She only had you there as a potential piggy bank. A $10 soda for a $40 teddy bear? Is that some kind of joke? Drop her as a friend. And screw the people who took her side. Man, I don't miss this petty drama from hs lol!", "NTA - I doubt her bf would want a big teddy bear anyway. It'd probably end up in his closet and in the trash when they inevitably break up. If she can't afford a gift and wants someone else to pay for it, it really isn't from her now is it? She could buy him a card and his favorite candy and leave it at that.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t seem like a good friend", "Deleted as not needed", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
