The natural consequence of this is to just not tell her things anymore.

Talk about the weather, but that\u2019s about it. If she spreads your info around in the future, it\u2019s on you for telling her. Draw some boundaries, and as hard as it is, keep them.

Since she's basically told you that she is going to keep blabbing your confidences to her friends, who then feel they have a right to scold you, limit the information you share with her.  Given your age there may be things you have to tell her, but limit as much as you can.  Block her friends who want to stick their noses in.

I think this is a really good lesson in how toxic social media is _for you_. All of those other people have direct access to your brain. They could directly reach out and complain at you. Setting aside all of the more insidious side effects of social media on teen mental health, don\u2019t give those people the power to make you feel the way you did.
