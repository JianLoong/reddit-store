Given that your mum is narcissist and left you with clear feelings about no self worth and having to prove yourself to her, it\u2019s is your best interests to consider if you should continue to live with her or not.\n\nYou feel more comfortable with father and his family, it sounds you are treated as any child should. \n\nYou have to do what is right for you and it doesn\u2019t feel that the current situation is helping. \n\nIf a consequence of you moving means risk of homelessness/poverty for mother that is nothing to do with you and she has to accept consequences of her behaviour, please remember that you are still a child and  have no responsible for taking care of your mother.\n\nApart from the financial implication, this could allow you time and space to improve your wellbeing and help you develop clear boundaries with her which you really need. This is not say you don\u2019t love her, we are hard wired and expectations of society that we should love and respect our parents, that is only possible when said parents show love, care and support for their children.\n\nComing from a similar childhood, it took me many years to accept my mother may love me but she only cares for herself. Dealing with the consequences of my mother treatment of me was hard, but it can be done. Some part of me still love her, that little child still inside of me but I\u2019m angry and hurt by her and I\u2019m entitled to those feelings just like you.\n\nYou do what\u2019s the right thing for you.

The more you can improve your emotional and mental wellbeing, the sooner you can recover and be in a less damaged state for adult hood.

If you're struggling to see what your mother does as emotional abuse, reread again.\n\nYou're not responsible for your mother. She's supposed to be responsible for you. Having to make yourself worthy of your existence in her household is abuse. Because no child should feel that their existence is an inconvenience, much less that they have to try to make themselves worth the trouble of being kept around. \n\nIf you feel seen and appreciated as you at your dad's house, go live with your Dad. If your mother can't afford her lifestyle without the child support (even with one less mouth to feed), then that is truly a \"her\" problem. And I honestly wonder how much of the money she is getting was being used for your needs. You'll feel guilt for a bit. It's natural. She'll \"love bomb\" you too, and that will make you feel bad for a bit. Until you realize that if she cared as much about you as she does about the money, you wouldn't have felt like an inconvenience to begin with. Then it will just hurt and I'm sorry for that. \n\nKeep going to therapy and be honest, with yourself and your therapist. Perhaps they can help you mourn the mother that you should have had while appreciating the family that you do.\n\nGood luck to you. Bad parents are a hard thing to accept, because they're yours and society says that we should love them because they love us. But not every parent (or partner or aunt or grandpa or child) is loving or deserving of respect or trust. So my best advice (not that you asked) is to understand that you can love someone without liking or trusting them. \n\nYou are not responsible for your mother. You are responsible for you and your well-being. And you shouldn't have to be, because that was your parents' job, but one isn't up to it and until recently the other wasn't allowed. \n\nNTA go live with your Dad.", "I think it says a lot about you to worry about your mother even after everything she put you through. However, you are allowed to be selfish. You are allowed to be happy. You are allowed to put yourself first. \n\nPlease remember: children don't care of parents.

Mental health is part of your overall health. A good therapist won't throw around the words \"emotional abuse\" without cause.

You're not one of them. If anything you're downplaying the seriousness of your situation. \n\nYour mother has a negative effect on your mental health. You feel you have to make up for merely existing when you're with her.
