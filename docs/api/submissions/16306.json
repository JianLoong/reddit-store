We use a spreadsheet to track our budget and stick to it pretty closely, but especially recently as our dog has started having health problems as he reaches the end of his life. My husband works 50 hours a week fully in-office and I work 40 hours fully from home, so I have been providing the majority of the care for our dog, which is fine for me because I do love him very much. It's a lot right now because he is having accidents inside the house and needs help getting up and down the stairs, but I understand that (sadly) it won't be for much longer.\n\nWe have spent about $10,000 on his medical expenses over the last year or so, which....honestly, to me, is too much. He is 11 years old, and no amount of medical intervention is going to buy him a significant amount of time. But it's very hard for my husband to let go, and there are no other competing emergencies or big expenses that we need to save up for right now, so I am agreeing to the cost of care...money is not the most important thing to me, and we have what we need.\n\nNow, I know I'm partially the ass here because my husband and I specifically agreed that we were going to trim the fat from our budget and buckle down so that we could get these medical expenses paid off with as little interest paid as possible. We completely zeroed out our dining out allotment and I have stuck to it well enough...I have only eaten out twice in the last five months, and it was a cheap fast food meal both times, but my husband did talk to me about it both times and I did agree to stick to it. I don't know why I would do it again after agreeing not to, I think I'm just stressed.\n\nMy friend invited me out to a Brazilian steakhouse, which is all you can eat meats + a pretty fancy salad bar for about $60 per person, before tip. I know it was much more expensive than cheating on the budget with fast food, but I went. I have been taking care of our dog plus chores plus a full time job without any fun money for myself for five months and I just...wanted it. My husband completely blew up at me over it, way more than I thought was warranted. We are not paycheck to paycheck, we both make good money and aren't overextended on our house or vehicles. Owing 10k for the dog sucks, but it's manageable, and if he was the one who had said \"Fuck it\" and gone out for a nice dinner, I honestly think I would have completely understood. I actually wish he would give himself more leeway and I told him I think we should revisit how frugal we are being with the budget, to which he angrily said that it's too late to have that conversation after I already decided that it didn't apply to me.

It would have been better, obviously, to clear this expense with him ahead of time since you guys both agreed to the stringent spending, but it seems completely unreasonable to control your spending *this* tightly.

Probably displaced grief.\n\nSo NTA.", "I'm gonna take the middle path and say ESH.\n\nYou both agreed to the budget and you acknowledged you went out just because you wanted it. Nothing more to be said there, you took your flak.\n\nNow your husband on the other hand.. man, to blow up over $60 when you're not financially insecure is a little inappropriate; he should learn to be more flexible. As for the dog, I just hope you two make the best decision for his wellbeing. It really doesn't sound like he has much longer left so it might be time to visit discussions about letting him have his sunset sooner rather than later, as much as it sucks.\n\nHusband needs to put aside his attachment and make the right decision out of love for his dog.", "It may sound unkind, but our vet medical expenses can only cost what we literally have in our account.

I draw the line at them not being able to endure the pain of aging. I know that 15 is an old dog but as children we've had family dogs that had to be put down much younger. We learned not to prolong a life of suffering. Excessive medical vet bills speak volumes volumes about how much suffering this poor animal is enduring.", "NAH, leaning towards NTA. \n\nFull disclosure: I LOVE my dogs.

I get wanting to do what you can to make his life comfortable.\n\nI also get your perspective - I don't like living like I've taken a vow of poverty.  Just because the vet bill is huge doesn't mean that you have to eat bread and water for the better part of a year (obs not, but fast food 2 times in 5 months seems like you're already living pretty frugally)\n\nYou two are not aligned on spending styles. Honestly, my BF now and I are in a similar position.  You two need to get more aligned on the spending for the dog. In our case, we had to come to the agreement that we wouldn't throw thousands of $ to treat a terminal illness  that does not extend her life.  As tough as it is, you should have a similar conversation with him so you're not stuck eating PB&J sammiches for the rest of the decade.", "NTA here-- I'm giving your husband a pass ONLY because I know he's struggling against the grief of losing his pet-- HOWEVER he's definitely AH adjacent for blowing up at you for 2 fast food meals and ONE luxury meal in a year when you've been a good sport about spending yourselves into serious debt for his dog.  Marriage is a partnership-- somehow he is forgetting that.  Do you have any funds that are yours to use without him looking over your shoulder or having a tantrum?", "Your husband is honestly being extremely controlling.

The following link talks about end of life care, and has a really helpful assessment to look objectively at your dog's current state. It's hard to say goodbye, even harder when you have to authorize the euthanasia. Emotionally, we're terrified of saying yes too soon, because we love them. The assessment helps because it's not just a one day score. You track the scores and you can visually see if the bad days are outnumbering the good. One bad day in a month filled with really good days? Overall, they're happy and not suffering, no reason to euthanize. But when 20 days are bad and the remaining 10 days are just barely ok? That's not a happy dog, that's one who's suffering, and their body doesn't know to quit. That's when you need to call the vet, give him extra love and snuggles, and help him pass in peace. \n\nhttps://www.lapoflove.com/blog/end-of-life-care-and-euthanasia/quality-of-life-assessment-a-critical-tool-for-your-senior-pet", "NTA  Yes you broke down and broke the budget.

One was my elderly 11 year old Cocker Spaniel, he was having accidents and lost most of the muscle mass in his back legs to even fully stand. At the very end i was carrying him up and downstairs of my apartment to take him out 4 times a day. I made the absolutely heart breaking decision to put him down because it was simply his time.\n The second one i had no other option but to put down was my 5 month old basset puppy. The poor little babe ended up developing Bloat and that turned his stomach upside and twisted it. The surgery would have cost $5,000 - $7,000 to fix it, I was in the vet hospital wailing and wailing because i didn't want to put my baby down but i didn't qualify for the payment plan methods they accepted and i live paycheck to paycheck. \n\nIf i had the money for my second pups surgery i would have gone through it because he barely was starting to experience life, as he was only 5 months. But my cocker spaniel even if i had the money to pay $10k to extend his life i would have still gone with the decision to put him down as it would have been selfish for me to keep him going. \n\nOP your SO's reaction to the $60 is a bit over the top, and uncalled for considering the substantial amount put to the dog.
