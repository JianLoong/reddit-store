I think everyone else was picking up on her racism and she's losing friends, so if everyone sees that you're cool with her now then it all must be water under the bridge.", "NTA. If she really wants to make amends you can forgive her after she proves she really understands and regrets.

You don\u2019t owe any racists your ear or understanding. It\u2019s always on us POC to forgive and move on. Fuck that. Do it on your time or not at all if you don\u2019t feel like it.", "NTA\n\nI suppose you could have been nicer, but your reaction is totally understandable. No one is obligated to forgive someone after an apology.", "NTA and i'm surprised she could hear you over the sound of her novelty squeaky shoes.", "NTA.

If she truly feels bad about what she did, her **actions** will speak for her.\n\n**Actions always show our true feelings, not the words we say.**\n\nIn the case of constantly saying insulting words, implications and slurs to you, she should stop saying them and, if there is a punishment on the books for it, she should receive that punishment.   \n\nShe is an AH for expecting a few tears and apologetic words to make up for what she's been doing for quite some time.", "Lmfao NTA and if I could give you an award for being an absolute king I would.", "NTA. It's not your job to be the caregiver of her feelings. Besides, the way she treated you in the past made it way more likely that you were being set up for a prank.", "NTA. People seem to not understand that the offended party has no obligation to be forgiven. You own the clown nothing, nada, zero. Good job and I hope things get easier for you in class from now on.", "NTA she was an AH and just because she realized it doesn\u2019t mean you have any obligation to help her with her guilt.

But if she was actually being sincere, there probably was a better was to handle it rather than to tell her to fuck off.  That might drive her back to being her old racist self.  But, I understand where you are coming from.", "NTA. You aren't obligated to forgive her or anyone else. It's good if she really has seen how wrong she is and changes, but you owe her nothing. And just because she wants to make amends doesn't mean you have to accept.\n\nIf she gets upset about that and mad at you, then she hasn't really grown much as a person.", "DEFINITELY NTA!!!!", "NTA\n\nYou are having to deal with an ugly situation, and it is terrible that your school does nothing to address the situation. You deserve better.\n\nYou are never obligated to accept an apology, especially not from a racist. She's being enabled by the school, too. The problem is bigger than an isolated case of bullying. \n\nIf your parents aren't involved, they need to be. You need some kind of adult advocacy here to lend authority to your reports.
