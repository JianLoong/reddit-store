Microaggressions most often refers to the unconscious or indirect expressions of bias, but technically is a matter of the scale on which the aggression is being perpetrated rather than the direct or indirect nature of the prejudice expressed. If the principal were referring to all the kids of a certain race by a slur during an assembly, then because of the institutional scale and power difference between the principal and the students, it would no longer be a microaggression. Because this is happening interpersonally, quietly, and between peers, it remains technically a microaggression. I agree that it is at the more severe end of that spectrum, relative to the more unconscious or subtle forms that are usually used as examples of the term. It is also being compounded by the institutional negligence and probable institutional bias of school officials failing to intervene.", "Its not ok obviously."]}
