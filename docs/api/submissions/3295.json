I graduated college with a degree in medical office, and found a decent desk job at a doctors office that pays well with benefits. I am currently living in an apartment with my fianc\u00e9 (22M).\n\nOccasionally we visit my parents, who live with my three sisters. The day before Thanksgiving my sister (26F) made a false accusation claiming my boyfriend damaged her car and scratched the back. \n\nIt is true he was behind her on the way home, but he says he never hit or damaged her car in any way. She says she\u2019s willing to drop it if he pays her out of pocket, he said ok let me pull up the footage.\n\nShe must not have known he had cameras in the front and back after getting into a minor accident. So we checked it and even showed it to our parents and her. There is one point he gets a few feet behind her, but he never scratched her car because the scratch was already there.\n\nSo it could\u2019ve been from another car, but it wasn\u2019t him. This upset me and him for him to be scammed and accused of, but we made the decision to disinvite her and the family members who sided with her.\n\nThis of course caused further drama, because she never apologized to him for accusing him and saying he\u2019s not a good driver. And she had already helped contribute to the wedding. I\u2019m offering to give back or pay for the stuff she contributed, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m open to her coming.\n\nThey aren\u2019t that close as he is always busy with work and doesn\u2019t get to visit a lot. But AITA for disinviting sibling/family members for a false accusation?\n\nEdit: This is one of my older half-sisters (same mom) so we didn\u2019t grow up together which is why we aren\u2019t that close. When I moved out from my father\u2019s and into my now fianc\u00e9s apartment, I started visiting my mom more. \n\nShe currently lives with her mother (my grandma) and my older half sister and 2 younger sisters. It\u2019s not about being petty or regretting it because I don\u2019t have any regrets, which is why I\u2019m firm on my decision. \n\nI\u2019m upset and would\u2019ve reconsidered my choice to disinvite her, had she not start this and lie about her car being scratched by my fianc\u00e9 to get money. She brought this up to the family saying he did it, and had no doubts or hesitation saying since he was the car behind her.\n\nAnd also, I wouldn\u2019t want to be associated with people who lie and don\u2019t own up to it. I could understand if she said \u201cI think you scratched my car\u201d. But she outright stated it was him. I\u2019ve got calls from family asking why my fianc\u00e9 hit her and etc, which I don\u2019t have the time to listen to when I\u2019m busy working. \n\nAnd she could\u2019ve brought it up with him first, instead of going through our mom using and involving my mother who wasn\u2019t even involved with this.
