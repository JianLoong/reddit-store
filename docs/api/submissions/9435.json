I have an extremely rocky relationship with one of my sisters (I have 3). She never seemed to like me as a child (she is 17 years older than me) and when I took a gap year after high school to work and save money for college, she and her husband invited me to stay with them for the year. I thought it would be a good way to mend bridges and actually get to know her, so I accepted.\n\nAlmost from the beginning she was abus*ve, mostly psychologically, yelling at me if I made the smallest mistake and then saying that \"all she wanted was to get sister time\" but that I was ruining it. Additionally, her kids would often eat snacks I bought or my shampoo and conditioner, so I started keeping them in my room. Sister got angry and said I couldn't store snacks in my room and that it was a house rule. I put the snacks back in the kitchen and they started getting eaten again, so I began hiding them in my closet (bugs were not an issue, she just didn't want food outside the kitchen).\n\nOne day she wanted me to babysit the kids the next morning and I told her I was working. She called me a liar and physically pulled me down the stairs to my room and demanded I open my email and show her the schedule. I did and she left the room, no apology. The next day in the grocery store someone came up and thought I was being ab*sed by a boyfriend because of the bruise pattern on my arm.\n\nI still deal with the mental damage and panic attacks caused by her gaslighting and constant blaming me for everything. If I tried to defend myself she would call me argumentative and defiant and said she didn't understand how mom and dad put up with me, much less love me. If I stayed silent she called me sullen, bitter, resentful, and said I was cursing God in my heart. By the 6 month mark I was su*c*dal.\n\nA year later I went back to her house with my parents and we had a sit-down with her and her husband. She immediately started by saying she was glad we were talking as they felt that I had really wronged them when I lived with them. The conversation went downhill from there, but at the end she said she felt like it was all resolved and she was happy. She did apologize for an instance where she had thrown me into a wall, but that was about it.\n\nNow, 10 years later (I was 17 at the time as I graduated high school a year early) I have told another sibling that I do not trust sister to be around my child once born. She told me I was over-reacting and should let bygones be bygones as older sister loves her nieces and nephews and hasn't displayed any hurtful behavior towards Sister #2's kids. I still don't feel comfortable around sister and sure as hell don't want her around my child. So: WIBTA if I tell her I don't want her touching my child?", "created_utc": 1675857194, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wur2p/wibta_if_i_tell_my_sister_she_is_not_allowed_to/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m wanting to tell my older sister that I don\u2019t want her around or touching my child who is due in a few months.\n2. My family is very close-knit and we spend time around each other often.

You're not the asshole for not trusting your sister who has abused you and still doesn't show any sign of repentance.", "YWNBTA (NTA). I'm surprised you're not no-contact with this sister, to be honest. Congratulations on your pregnancy, and keep your little one safe from dangerous family members.", "NTA. Just cut her off and be done with her.", "NTA.\n\nBut I don't believe you have to tell her.  Just make it your rule. Telling her just opens up a chance for debate, so why subject yourself to that when it's unneeded?  Your other sibling didn't have your live in experience with this sister, and so their opinion doesn't seem to take that experience into account.\n\nYou aren't obligated to let anyone you're uncomfortable with to touch your child.", "NTA\n\nDon't tell the abusive sister that she can't touch your child.  She will consider it a dare (and try to be around your child when you aren't looking to torture the child in secret...or try to hold your child so that she can show others how you freak out at the smallest thing when she wasn't doing anything to the child), turn it into a big drama with other family members to demonstrate how 'unstable' you are, and make your life more miserable.\n\nInstead, NEVER have your children around this sister at all.  Go total NC or as LC as possible.  If LC, then don't let your child out of your sight when she is around.   Have pre-made excuses to get your child as soon as this sister tries to touch your child.  Have your husband do the same.   It is perfectly acceptable to say \"baby needs changing\" or \"time to see if baby is sleepy\" or \"baby misses daddy\" and remove the baby from abusive sister's reach.  Or just don't let anyone hold the baby while your abusive sister is in the same house.\n\nIf NC with abusive sister, then yes, it means that family members won't understand why you are the one removing yourself from family gatherings, and yes it will hurt.  But family are the people that you choose to be in your life.  Simply being related genetically doesn't always mean they are family.   If your other siblings love you, then they will see you away from abusive sister.  If they choose sides, then they obviously didn't care for you enough to support your choices.\n\nAs for your other sister #2, she has a different relationship with abusive sister.  It doesn't that sister #2's children are being treated okay by abusive sister, as that is not an indicator of how abusive sister will treat your children.   Obviously, abusive sister was much nicer to your other siblings, while she was abusive to you (physically and emotionally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If I tried to defend myself she would call me argumentative and defiant and said she didn't understand how mom and dad put up with me, much less love me. If I stayed silent she called me sullen, bitter, resentful, and said I was cursing God in my heart.\n\nThere is no 'winning' (or winning over) with abusive sister.  There is no way that you can behave in a way that will change how this sister treats you.\n\nThis sister obviously hates you.  She gaslights you (said you wronged her family and badmouths you to other family members), has pulled you downstairs (where it left a visible bruise that was a concern to a complete stranger), and threw you into a wall.  She is not to be trusted with your children, as she is likely to transfer her aggression to them also.\n\nI want to know what your parents think actually happened after the discussion with this sister?  \n\n\nAnd why has this abuse (pulling down stairs, throwing into a wall) been a family secret for so long?", "NTA. Your sister is physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive. Period.", "NTA but she will never listen to you and making a big declaration will just create drama. It would be best to simply go no contact or things will get bad.", "NTA , she abused you and you\u2019re doing it right by going no-contact with your sis.", "NTA. She needs serious therapy as she is horribly abusive. Considering the way she has treated you, you have every right to be concerned about the way she would treat your baby. If you are at a family gathering, I would just keep your child away from her ( and sister #2, who sees nothing wrong with first sister's past behavior).", "NTA. However, telling her that she can\u2019t touch your child is basically like telling her: \u201cmy biggest weakness is my child\u201d. Which is just oil on the fire and gives away where she can hurt you the most. She clearly doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re hurt, and, if you keep in touch with her (by any means), for her getting in touch with your child - as they belong to you - will be unavoidable. And there\u2019s only one way to find out if she\u2019d behave the same way with your child - but I personally wouldn\u2019t wanna experiment on my baby. And I do understand why your other sibling tries to mediate by telling you how this \u201cbig sister\u201d is nice to their child, but as far as your story goes, she didn\u2019t treat your other sibling(s) in the same way as she treated you. There\u2019s a very good chance that your child, in the eyes of your ab*ser, is a resemblance of you and she\u2019d resent them purely based on that. So, I\u2019d cut all contacts with her, altogether.", "NTA. She sounds vile.", "NTA, maybe she doesn\u2019t do that kind of stuff in front of sister #2 but it doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t do it. Some things can be let go, but not what she did to you. Not without some sort of apology or discussion and some work or therapy on your sisters part. It seems like she doesn\u2019t see how she treated you was inappropriate.", "NTA.\n\nYou know first hand the effects that this individual can have on a person. She drove you to being suicidal.\n\nProtecting your child from the same is completely instinctual and understandable.", "Nope, NTA. Your sister is abusive.", "NTA you should honestly go no contact with that sister, she seems like a danger to you physically and mentally. I couldn't imagine having a newborn baby around her..", "NTA. The minute you lay hands on someone you\u2019re out in my book. My parents will never be around my unborn child for that exact reason, and no amount of \u201cbut they never hurt (other grandkid)!\u201d Will change that.\nIt\u2019s the risk. Do you want to risk her ever snapping and treating your kid the way she treated you?\n\n\u201cPlease remember this is the sister who physically dragged me backwards down a flight of stairs and threw me up against a wall, in addition to other instances of abuse. If you think for one second a half-@ssed apology can make up for that enough for me to trust her around my children I question if YOU are to be trusted with my child either.\u201d", "NTA", "NTA cut her fully out of your life. She is unhinged and dangerous. Never let her see or interact with any children you have. Get a restraining order if you need to.", "NTA. Go no contact. You dont have to let her near your kids or have her in your life.", "For the sake of your child, please get therapy. It's incredibly concerning that you're asking anonymous internet strangers whether you should keep a physically and verbally abusive person away from your child.", "YWBTA.  Not for not wanting her to touch your child, but for feeling like you have to TELL her. That's just starting a fight.  \n\n\nIf you know that she is abusive, just don't let her babysit your child or have any alone time with him/her. \n\nIf you happen to be at a family gathering, and she is there and wants to hold the baby, you can make some excuses to avoid it, but ultimately it's unlikely she is going to hurt your child in front of everyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There are certain things that don't even need to be debated, and that is any form of physical or emotional abuse. There is a lot of negative history behind your relationship and for you to have a healthy life, it wouldn't be of any help to maintain this. It's your others siblings choice whether they keep their relationship with her or not, but you are in charge of your own life and choices.
