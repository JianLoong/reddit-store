When we switched our phones back on upon landing I had several voicemails and texts from my dad saying that my mom had had a heart event and was in hospital, giving us updates as to where to go and asking us to come directly from the airport. I was relaying all of this to my wife as all passengers began to stand to deplane.\n\nI was in the aisle seat so as soon as possible I stepped into the aisle and got our luggage down from the overhead. My wife was in the middle seat. She picked up our kid, who was in the window seat, and tried to step into the aisle directly after me to continue speaking, as we were traveling as a unit. The woman in the aisle seat across from me told her to sit back down and that deplaneing happens in \"zipper feed-in method\". I've never heard this before, so I told the woman that my wife and I needed to stay together right now. The woman shrugged and stepped between me and my wife, so I reached around the woman, took my wife's hand, and pulled her and our kid past the other lady. I then continued to tell my wife what had happened, what the latest from my dad was, and we made a plan for me to go straight to the hospital in a taxi with Kid while my wife stayed, collected our checked bags, dropped them at my parents' place, and came to the hospital as well.\n\nThe other lady caught up to us at pass control and was absolutely incandescent. My wife was calmer than I was and tried to explain that there were circumstances that meant that we needed to stay together, but I jumped in and said that it's never okay to prioritise \"zipper feed in method\" exiting a plane over a family seated together deplaning together. The woman said that if a family can't be separated for a few minutes they probably don't need to be flying, and that we cannot ignore the rules of society.\n\nAITA?My mom is recovering well btw!", "created_utc": 1688064307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mcwqp/aita_for_trying_to_deplane_my_family_together/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've traveled quite a bit and never heard of the \"zipper feed-in method\", especially when people are clearly traveling together. I'll give the benefit of the doubt that you could have probably communicated better, but it's also not this stranger's business to need to be told \"I'm sorry, my mom just had a heart event and I'm trying to talk to my wife about the updates\" but that doesn't make you the asshole. This woman is making up \"rules of society\". If anything the rule is, if people are obviously traveling together, you let them stand/deplane together before moving into the aisle.", "NTA - Zipper method is fine, but it can go by row, it does not have to be individual.", "NTA.\n\nPeople advocating zipper-feed method are the kind of people who do theoretical calculations in idealized models and then can't deal with more complicated reality.\n\nComplicated reality here is that you are a family and breaking family for the purpose of zipper-feed will invole things such as leaving kids alone, making whole thing a much worse mess.", "NTA and this is ridiculous. I\u2019ve flown quite a bit in my life and it\u2019s always the same. One row (a-c; d-f) deplanes at a time. Zipper fashion is ridiculous", "NTA. It's not individual by individual, it's family group by family group. She was probably just upset that she didn't get into the aisle in front of you. \n\nGlad your mother is recovering!", "I\u2019ve flown a LOT and never realized that zipper feed method is a societal rule when getting off a plane. \ud83e\udd23it\u2019s usually row by row however that works out. Whether 3 seats one side and 3 seats other side. You\u2019re all getting off the plane. Being 2 people back wasn\u2019t going to kill her. She\u2019d die if she was on the Korean air flight I was on. When we landed in the Philippines it was a free for all when getting off. You just stepped out and got off as you could and hoped for the best.", "NTA. The zipper method makes zero sense.\n\nDeplaning row-by-row is the social norm because it's assumed that people belonging to the same group would opt to sit in the same row, and thus prevent the situation where your wife was cut-off by this random lady.", "ESH. \n\nYes the lady was weird, but let her off. You're all going to the same place - as immigration proved. You got into a physical altercation on the airplane over 10 seconds?", "NTA - That is not a thing. \n\nZipper merging is a thing on highway onramps and actually can improve the flow of traffic if everyone is doing it correctly. People deplaning are not the same as cars on a highway  - the way they move, whether they have overhead bags (in their row or another), whether they have physical limitations, and how they occasionally travel in groups, etc. The logic does not translate.", "NTA", "NTA. I would let family be together because of child and possibly heavy rollers they might need to manage between themselves. Other than that, it doesn't matter because it's only 100 feet inside the plane and anyone can be reunited outside. So, that lady was just looking for some target for her grumpy mood.", "You aren't honestly saying that 60 seconds while getting off the plan with ONE person between you and your wife was making a life or death difference?   Glad your mom was ok but YTA here", "YTA. I don\u2019t think it would make much difference how you got off the plane. Just get off in the usual way and make your plan. It\u2019s like people who stop traffic to let someone in and end up taking longer than if you\u2019d followed the rules.", "kinda ESH for you and the lady, your wife's okay. \n\nNow I admittedly don' t fly in the US nor transatlantic, but yeah we usually zip out of the airplane here, at least those I've been on in the past like 5 years, to be honest it is much less chaotic and fair as multiple people are usually catching another flight and are nervous about being stuck. That being said  of course if there is a family emergency I feel like most people would not be AH and let you in front of them had you asked politely. \n\nShe is absolute lunatic to continue the conflict even at the airport , but again you were not helping to deflect , kudos to your wife here, I think you were stressed about your parents so it is kinda understandable that you snapped, but still your wife and kid were there, might be better to react calmly to lunatic's anttics next time.", "ESH. Gosh sakes, pull back in and let the kook ahead of you, problem solved. Butting heads with a fool, even when you're right, is a no-win.  I do like the description of the difficult lady as \"incandescent\", tho'.  Sorry about your Mum, happy she's on the mend.", "YTA - she was a jerk but you can't push, pull and shove on a plane, and you don't slow people up. Having literally ONE PERSON between you is not like you're massively separated and you can fill your wife in in the time it takes to walk from the plane to passport control and stand in the queue.", "NTA.  Deplaning is row by row - not staggered!  And who continues to be so pissed off over something so stupid that they actually continue the argument after you're off the plane!  She obviously has some issues.", "ESH.\n\nIt's one body out of sequence so it's nbd to let one person go.\n\nHowever...\n\nIf they employed the zipper method, your wife and child would have been behind the person behind you in line. They'd be maybe 5 feet behind you and you can get back with them once you're at the gate. \n\nEverybody made a big deal out of nothing.", "9/11 reference", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did she reach the airport a whole 10 seconds sooner than if she'd been able to go between the two of you?", "1. The woman more or less just invented the \"zipper feed-in\" deplaning method. It happens spontaneously sometimes on small planes, but row-by-row is most common.\n2. In general, when traveling with small kids, I wait until the mad rush has got off the plane. My kids walk slower than the rushing people, they've probably got a thousand things stashed in the seat pocket that they have to put away in their bags, and there are good odds that we're going to stop at a bathroom at some point between the plane and the immigration line. So I don't need to be rushing off the plane and trying to get a few places further ahead in line.\n3. We can discuss theoretically optimal deplaning strategies if you like, but there are a lot of variables. If you have to get a bag out of an overhead bin, you're worse than someone who just has a small item under the seat. But if there's a line of people that aren't going anywhere, then a competent adult can probably extract their bag from the overhead whilst standing in the aisle next to their seat, without causing a delay at all. Things that do often cause delays are people who are getting out of the window seat in a \"row by row\" deplaning, and then have to stop in the aisle and dither around to try and retrieve their bag. If you've got a group traveling together, then whoever has the aisle seat should retrieve all the bags from the overhead bins before the line moves, and that way, you don't cause delay.\n\nNTA", "That old lady was talking out of her ass! NTA she made that whole 'zipper-feed method' thing up.", "Yeah it is basically row by row, although depending on whether passengers are grouped or flying alone I do sometimes see people exit in what might end up being closer to a seat by seat rather than row by row pattern depending on if they have to pull from overhead etc\n\nBut that woman was a nut for insisting on seat by seat with a grouped family. I\u2019ve never seen anyone try to make that argument. \n\nHowever from the comments here it appears that many people are not even aware of the general row by row zipper", "For real. Every plane I've ever been on has used the crowd crush method.", "What airline so I can avoid it lol", "same here.  i've flown a ton of times with my wife, and i've never had anyone try to edge in between us, and would have been flabbergasted if so.", "Being sooo extreme about the literal execution of the zipper feed sure I\u2019ll agree with you on that, but adhering to the spirit of zipper feed is effective and reduces a lot of chaos and annoyance. \n\nKeeping a family together with small kids or any other situation where a person needs assistance is obviously a good reason to break the zipper a bit. The passengers that gave him hell about it sound a little nutty. \n\nBut recently I was on a couple planes where clearly many of the people don\u2019t fly often, and passengers were charging ahead from behind and leaving no room for many of us to exit our seats without either waiting til the end or being pushy. And staring at us wild eyed in disbelief when we came out of our row at the proper time, according to a zipper feed. and safely got our bag down from the overhead, because apparently we were holding them up since they felt entitled to just charge ahead of everyone.", ">The zipper method makes zero sense.\n\nIt would if everybody moved at a steady pace. I wish I could draw a picture here but, basically, if we labeled people by side and seat (L&R Aisle, Middle, and Window)...\n\nRA gets in the aisle and takes a step forward.  \nLA gets in the aisle while RM is moving into RA position.  \nBy time RM is able to move into the aisle, *L*M can be moving into LA position  \nAnd so on and so fifth\n\nBut humans are typically not this organized or patient.", "It is absolutely a thing on planes, and you will annoy many passengers if you are totally unaware and just push ahead as soon as the seatbelt lights go off.\n\nHowever it is not the way the weird woman on his flight insisted. It is not seat by seat breaking up passengers that flew together. It\u2019s generally row by row, and even then most courteous people will let two rows on one side go together if they are all in a group etc, so it\u2019s loosely row by row but accommodating the groups.", "Also, plenty of times the FAs ask to give priority to those with connections.

On a full flight, carry-ons aren't always directly above the passenger, either.", "I am not saying that they should push right ahead. But zipper merge does imply person by person. Like the teeth of a zipper. Which is not how it works on planes. \n\nRow by row is exactly what this family was trying to do. They were all in the same row on one side of the aisle. The rude woman was in the same row, but on the other side of the aisle.

Which obviously doesn't make sense.", "Yes and most people will comply with this. There are always whiners but most people are looking to keep the flight calm and drama free from beginning to end. Usually anyone who asks politely to deplane ahead for a connection or emergency will not get much push back from others.", "United was gonna be my guess. United in misery.", "They are definitely not always a mess. I usually fly Delta and almost always the deplaning is calm and relatively organized with a general zipper pattern other than those exact cases of allowing families with young children or those with physical limitations through, and some people do stay behind til the end. \n\nThe times I experienced the chaos were on non Delta connecting flights.", ">I drive in Los Angeles\n\nMy condolences.", "It\u2019s semantic, row by row still creates the image of a zipper just with bigger teeth and that term is often used to describe deplaning row by row", "Except on Reddit flight threads, way too often. It\u2019s crazy what some people on here consider normal/acceptable when flying. I remember someone posting that you should be required to buy a premium seat if you have a connection. I feel like many on this sub don\u2019t get out much.", "I fly much more often now but even when I only flew every few years I caught onto the norms of boarding and deplaning pretty quickly, I think it also just comes down to how observant and curious someone is vs just wandering around oblivious to their surroundings. \n\nYou see it in all types of group/crowd settings, where everyone is flowing in a direction and someone just stops right in the middle to scratch their ass, not even moving off to the side to let people pass, no awareness that other living beings are around."]}
