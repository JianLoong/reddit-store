When we switched our phones back on upon landing I had several voicemails and texts from my dad saying that my mom had had a heart event and was in hospital, giving us updates as to where to go and asking us to come directly from the airport. I was relaying all of this to my wife as all passengers began to stand to deplane.\n\nI was in the aisle seat so as soon as possible I stepped into the aisle and got our luggage down from the overhead. My wife was in the middle seat. She picked up our kid, who was in the window seat, and tried to step into the aisle directly after me to continue speaking, as we were traveling as a unit. The woman in the aisle seat across from me told her to sit back down and that deplaneing happens in \"zipper feed-in method\". I've never heard this before, so I told the woman that my wife and I needed to stay together right now. The woman shrugged and stepped between me and my wife, so I reached around the woman, took my wife's hand, and pulled her and our kid past the other lady. I then continued to tell my wife what had happened, what the latest from my dad was, and we made a plan for me to go straight to the hospital in a taxi with Kid while my wife stayed, collected our checked bags, dropped them at my parents' place, and came to the hospital as well.\n\nThe other lady caught up to us at pass control and was absolutely incandescent. My wife was calmer than I was and tried to explain that there were circumstances that meant that we needed to stay together, but I jumped in and said that it's never okay to prioritise \"zipper feed in method\" exiting a plane over a family seated together deplaning together. The woman said that if a family can't be separated for a few minutes they probably don't need to be flying, and that we cannot ignore the rules of society.\n\nAITA?My mom is recovering well btw!\n\nEDIT: Answered some questions in a comment below but I'm kind of a luddite and can't work out how to pin it, so here you go.

This woman is making up \"rules of society\". If anything the rule is, if people are obviously traveling together, you let them stand/deplane together before moving into the aisle.", "NTA - Zipper method is fine, but it can go by row, it does not have to be individual.", "NTA.\n\nPeople advocating zipper-feed method are the kind of people who do theoretical calculations in idealized models and then can't deal with more complicated reality.\n\nComplicated reality here is that you are a family and breaking family for the purpose of zipper-feed will invole things such as leaving kids alone, making whole thing a much worse mess.", "NTA and this is ridiculous.

When we landed in the Philippines it was a free for all when getting off. You just stepped out and got off as you could and hoped for the best.", "NTA. The zipper method makes zero sense.\n\nDeplaning row-by-row is the social norm because it's assumed that people belonging to the same group would opt to sit in the same row, and thus prevent the situation where your wife was cut-off by this random lady.", "ESH. \n\nYes the lady was weird, but let her off.

People deplaning are not the same as cars on a highway  - the way they move, whether they have overhead bags (in their row or another), whether they have physical limitations, and how they occasionally travel in groups, etc. The logic does not translate.", "NTA", "NTA. I would let family be together because of child and possibly heavy rollers they might need to manage between themselves.

Glad your mom was ok but YTA here", "YTA. I don\u2019t think it would make much difference how you got off the plane. Just get off in the usual way and make your plan.

That being said  of course if there is a family emergency I feel like most people would not be AH and let you in front of them had you asked politely. \n\nShe is absolute lunatic to continue the conflict even at the airport , but again you were not helping to deflect , kudos to your wife here, I think you were stressed about your parents so it is kinda understandable that you snapped, but still your wife and kid were there, might be better to react calmly to lunatic's anttics next time.", "ESH.

Sorry about your Mum, happy she's on the mend.", "YTA - she was a jerk but you can't push, pull and shove on a plane, and you don't slow people up.

She obviously has some issues.", "ESH.\n\nIt's one body out of sequence so it's nbd to let one person go.\n\nHowever...\n\nIf they employed the zipper method, your wife and child would have been behind the person behind you in line.

Did she reach the airport a whole 10 seconds sooner than if she'd been able to go between the two of you?", "1. The woman more or less just invented the \"zipper feed-in\" deplaning method. It happens spontaneously sometimes on small planes, but row-by-row is most common.\n2. In general, when traveling with small kids, I wait until the mad rush has got off the plane. My kids walk slower than the rushing people, they've probably got a thousand things stashed in the seat pocket that they have to put away in their bags, and there are good odds that we're going to stop at a bathroom at some point between the plane and the immigration line. So I don't need to be rushing off the plane and trying to get a few places further ahead in line.\n3. We can discuss theoretically optimal deplaning strategies if you like, but there are a lot of variables. If you have to get a bag out of an overhead bin, you're worse than someone who just has a small item under the seat. But if there's a line of people that aren't going anywhere, then a competent adult can probably extract their bag from the overhead whilst standing in the aisle next to their seat, without causing a delay at all. Things that do often cause delays are people who are getting out of the window seat in a \"row by row\" deplaning, and then have to stop in the aisle and dither around to try and retrieve their bag. If you've got a group traveling together, then whoever has the aisle seat should retrieve all the bags from the overhead bins before the line moves, and that way, you don't cause delay.\n\nNTA", "That old lady was talking out of her ass! NTA she made that whole 'zipper-feed method' thing up.", "Yeah it is basically row by row, although depending on whether passengers are grouped or flying alone I do sometimes see people exit in what might end up being closer to a seat by seat rather than row by row pattern depending on if they have to pull from overhead etc\n\nBut that woman was a nut for insisting on seat by seat with a grouped family.

The passengers that gave him hell about it sound a little nutty. \n\nBut recently I was on a couple planes where clearly many of the people don\u2019t fly often, and passengers were charging ahead from behind and leaving no room for many of us to exit our seats without either waiting til the end or being pushy. And staring at us wild eyed in disbelief when we came out of our row at the proper time, according to a zipper feed. and safely got our bag down from the overhead, because apparently we were holding them up since they felt entitled to just charge ahead of everyone.", ">The zipper method makes zero sense.\n\nIt would if everybody moved at a steady pace.

Not zipper one person at a time. That\u2019s illogical.", "Simple solution, for next time: When getting up from the aisle seat, stand in the aisle next to your seat so your family in the middle & window seats have room to leave in front of you. Then you\u2019re all in a row and not at the mercy of the people across the aisle.\n\nI\u2019m having a hard time picturing how you had room to pull your wife & child past another adult who was also in the aisle, no plane I\u2019ve ever been on has aisles wide enough for people to pass each other. That must\u2019ve been REALLY uncomfortable, and for that, YTA.\n\nYou didn\u2019t need to talk to your wife right that second, it wouldn\u2019t have slowed you down one bit to wait until you were off the plane. Maybe you were panicking too much to think clearly? But that doesn\u2019t mean other passengers have to be happy about getting pushed around.", "Nta.

People start getting up before the plane even stops.", "Hey, everyone!\n\nI really appreciate all of these comments. I hadn't really thought of deplaning in codified terms per se, though of course row-by-row has seemed more logical to me. If that seems to be the most accepted socially-legal method for disembarking, I of course can stick to that.\n\nTo answer a few questions-- yes, I fully agree that I overreacted. I got some sort of groggy adrenaline rush when I saw all of those messages and I was worried with a pit in my stomach. To be frank, I was already feeling like an AH because I had delayed this trip, knowing that my mom wasn't at top fitness, for a couple of months because of a work thing, and this felt like the last straw. The other thing that I specifically didn't mention in this post because I wanted to be judged on the merits of the situation with no other factor is that my wife and I are both women. I do not look like  our child at all, and I'm often excluded from assumed family dynamics as a result. \n\nAs for me pulling my wife through the aisle behind me-- this is the additional factor that I hadn't considered. My wife is very petite, Korean, and faces next to constant small put-downs from strangers who assume that she's a decade and a half younger than she is (36) and doesn't deserve adult respect. In retrospect, this may have been part of my ire-- she and the woman in question reached the aisle at the same time and the condescending tone in the woman's voice when she told my wife to sit got on my nerves. That shouldn't have been a problem for me,  but I was indeed in a state of panic and wasn't presenting my best self.\n\nThanks so much for all of the thoughts!", "NTA. I always make an effort to not get in between groups that are clearly travelling together.

Guaranteed to stay together then!", "NTA - travel companions stay together at deplaning (learned a new word today :) that goes especially for families. \n\ni would have guessed the other lady to be a first time flyer being nervous.

She seems to have difficulties to understand all \u201crules of society\u201d. because traveling in family groups is definitely a social rule.", "You\u2019re right it\u2019s by row, not by seat. That woman was wrong. NTA.", "Where I am the seat by seat zipper merge is fairly common, although practically 2 people in a row frequently merge, 3 occasionally do and it\u2019s never ideal because whenever there\u2019s a hold up due to retrieving a bag or something, the people in front of the hold up start coming out no matter which seat they\u2019re in. \n\nIt\u2019s weird that she was so insistent that it was a thing and the only possible option, but depending on where you are it genuinely is something that happens. I\u2019ve never seen true row by row because you can barely stand up in window seats, so usually those people just stay seated and wait a little bit longer.", "Sorry if that was unclear-- I was the one who took our daughter with us. My wife went alone. Furthermore, by this point, my wife didn't really know what was going on or even that we needed to part ways to begin with. All happened quite swiftly so it's somewhat difficult to describe.", "ES\n\nYou are assuming other people care about you, your family and your recent drama (you clearly announced it to publish it to the nearby passengers).  Most people just want to get off the aircraft.  Indeed we all have our own dramas and if you wanted to avoid the bustle, you should have waited until the rush died down.\n\nAs a single person I'm weary of couples and 'families' assuming they are entitled to any priority.  They get priority in so many walks of life  . the supermarket, the economy is designed to benefit 'families', holidays.

I\u2019m on my cell phone and thought it was for a different thread. Thanks.", "[removed]", "nta", "NTA\n\nThe other lady is partly correct, there is a methodology in disembarking.\n\nThe thing is, she has screwed it up slightly - you should zipper out as a row, not individual seats. So the seats on the right side will stand up and disembark, then the seats on the left side, then the right side of the row behind and so on. This means that the people travelling as a group and sharing a row stay together, rather than being muddled with those on the opposite side of the plane (then needing to stop and reorganise themselves once out of the plane).\n\nAnd a thought for both of you, being two or three people ahead or behind will make so little difference getting through the whole airport and away I wouldn't worry about it - you get a pass for being in extenuating circumstances where time was important, but the other person was just being rudely impatient.", "No one does the method she is saying and why were you even paying attention to her? I'm glad your mom is doing well. NTA.", "NTA", "That's the thing though. I kind of don't think that a family sitting in a row together is cutting a queue by getting off the plane together.
