This is absurd to me. The moment your aunt gave those items to your mom, they no longer belonged to aunt/cousin. Those items are now momentos of sentimental value to you/your mom and you have every right to keep them. Shame on any family members arguing that you don't \"need\" them anymore. They don't know what those items mean to you or what you may be saving them for and they should mind their own business.", "NTA\n\nIts absolutely absurd that your cousin asked you to give them to her.  They were your baby items, not your cousin's.  They have irreplaceable sentimental value to you and your mother.. not your cousin.", "NTA- the entitlement is unreal. You CANNOT claim back something that you have gifted someone. If you have given someone something to have, you have lost all rights on it.\n\nYour cousin wanting to destroy their old items is understandable, but they do not need your baby items: that is so creepy. You might not need the items but you have a sentimental value attached to these items that the cousin just does not have. She cannot lay claim to them when they were given to you and have been meaningful tokens of your life. They are memorabilia for you and your mum and they are not allowed to snatch that away from you.\n\nYour cousin can create a new identity for herself without snatching other peoples things; you needn\u2019t forsake anything for her issues.", "NTA\n\nYour cousins doesn't have the right to demand things that aren't theirs.", "NTA. Though she is transitioning, she cannot change the past and in the past her mother gave those items away and they were treasured by someone else.", "NTA. Her mom is still here to make her another blanket and everything\u2026 and those are not cherished memories to her, she only wants them because they were \u201csupposed to be\u201d hers. Who even claims something like that? They either were hers or they weren\u2019t. She can ask for them, sure, but demanding them and/or being upset over not getting them is just wack. It\u2019s a bunch of baby stuff that she\u2019ll probably just look at for a few weeks at most and then put in a box or something.", "NTA.\n\nYour cousin is WAY out of line. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around her, no one has to cater to her. She can ask for something, but she can also be told NO. She came out as trans. Cool. Good for her. But that does not give her the right to act like an entitled spoiled brat and destroy YOUR sentimental baby items. They stopped being hers when they became yours. She has ZERO claim over them and she\u2019s just gonna have to grow up and get over it. Your cousin has an ugly attitude that she\u2019d better fix.", "You don't ask for something back over 23 years later. \n\nNta.", "So what happens to old memories? You can\u2019t destroy or toss them, so it\u2019s best to move forward with the new identity, new life, and new memories. Life\u2019s too short for creating drama that is not necessary. NTA.", "NTA. Part of the shitty reality of being trans (which I am) is that in most cases, babies get pretty aggressively gendered, and even people who come out as children usually have the same issue. No amount of baby clothes can rewrite history\u2014and a lot of trans people, especially those who have recently come out, really wish they could do that. Maybe instead, make some plans with your cousin now to start building good memories with her true self. That would be more meaningful down the road.", "NTA\n\nWhat? Elle needs to deal with her own stuff. This is your baby items, not hers.", "NTA", "Ummm, Elle never even wore them.  I don't get why they would be sentimental to her if she was never pictured in them or anything.  It isn't like she would fit them.  Is Elle adopting a baby?  NTA.", "NTA. While I can see where your cousin is coming from in requesting the items, she has absolutely no right to demand them. They may have gender-confirming value for your cousin, but they were YOUR baby items and have sentimental value to you and your mother. \n\nThat being said, if your cousin ever comes around and perhaps apologizes for being an AH, it would be nice of you/your mom to consider giving her one or two (not sure how many you have - if it\u2019s only one or two I understand not wanting to do this) of the outfits your aunt made. It may be nice for her to have an original baby item showing that her mother\u2019s intuition was right all along. Of course, you\u2019re not under any obligation to do this, especially if she keeps being an AH about it, but it might help keep the peace with your family.", "NAH. I can understand her wanting to get rid of baby clothes with her deadname, though it may hurt her mother. If it helps her transition, well, that's just part of the process. \n\nShe chose her new name. While her mother may have planned to name her something, it was *never* her name, nor is it her name now. You and your mother have a far closer tie to the baby clothes she wants than she or her mother does. She is being unrealistic, and you and your mom are not assholes for wanting to keep *your* baby clothes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Absolutely absurd. \nI understand people want to move forward with their chosen identity. But when the items in question don\u2019t belong to them any longer, and have not for years, that\u2019s a bit entitled. NTA", "NTA, no question about it.   \nThey were given to your mom and gifts are gifts.   \nIt was over 20 years ago and through use they have now personal value that tie them to you and your mother. This cannot be undone.   \nIt almost sounds like your cousin would want to somehow share in your childhood as a girl because she rejects her own history. What she does now with her life and how she proceeds with the transition is her thing, but she just can't go back in time and change the past and reinvent her whole life history. It's unrealistic and unkind to even try it.", "I wouldn\u2019t even do that. Elle\u2019s mom can make her her very own baby blanket that suits her personality now. It\u2019s bizarre that she wants someone else\u2019s baby stuff. She can get her own and form an attachment to that instead of take from someone else by guilting them into it. No need for them to continue to be spoiled and get their way or special treatment. Boundaries need to be set and respected.", "Oh no, I totally agree. I just meant that if and ONLY if she does apologize, an outfit or two (assuming there are several) that her mother made with her in mind as a baby could be a nice (but absolutely not necessary at all) gesture and might get the rest of her family off her back, if she thinks they\u2019re going to keep giving her a hard time about it. I wouldn\u2019t even consider giving away the baby blanket at all - that is the most bizarre part to me, since it has OP\u2019s name embroidered on it and not her cousin\u2019s name. I guess in my mind, other than the original coming home outfit, most baby clothes end up discarded/sold/given away anyway. I suppose her and her mom may attach more sentimental value to these homemade clothes, though, if they\u2019ve kept them for all these years. And if that\u2019s the case, she shouldn\u2019t feel bad about not giving them away, as they\u2019re absolutely hers to keep if she wants to. Might be cute to dress her own kids in those baby clothes one day, if she has any!", "And if I read it right, Elle was going to be, for example, \"Christine\", which is now OPs name but when she transitioned picked \"Elle\" as her name and after this, some told \"Your mother was convinced you were going to be a girl and she was going to call you Christine\" and all the items are embroidered with Christine, not Elle?", "As soon as the aunt turns back time so plans mom make their memories attached to other things she can get the stuff she gifted them back JFC what ah both the cousin and the aunt.\n\nNTA op neither is your mom.\n\nTell aunty that a gift is that and can't be requested back once given even if only a day has passed never mind 23 years.
