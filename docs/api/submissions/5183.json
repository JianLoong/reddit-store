My sister (28f)  used to work afar so she had to leave him at my / my mother's care when he was a baby. Three years ago she found a job and house nearby, but my nephew still spends his weekdays in my place and only goes at my sister's place during the weekends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy nephew tends to be careless with everyone's stuff, but he's specially careless with mine. I think because he's closest to me and has no restrictions. He has already broken two phones, two eyeglasses, 1 laptop and so many other stuff. I chalk it up to him being a kid and therefore never gets mad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut when he turned 8, I started teaching him about boundaries. That when I tell him something is hands-off, then he must not play with it. A concept he's really having a hard time with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday I saw him fiddling with the contact lenses I just bought the other day. I told him it's a hands-off because I will need to wear it for an office party later, and that I wouldn't have any backup because he just broke my eyeglasses. An hour before the party, all I have to do is wear my contact lenses... et voila! It's missing. When I asked my nephew, he admitted to have dropped it. We looked for it to no avail, and I ended up not being able to go to the office party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the only time I got really mad. I got mad that he didn't listen to me for the nth time and that he didn't even bother picking it up after dropping it, because to me that shows his lack of respect to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSure I can buy a new pair again just like what I've done several times in the past, but I really wanted to teach him a lesson about boundaries and respect, and in my perspective, the best way to do that is show him the consequences. So, I dropped him to his mom afterwards and told both of them that he will be banned at my place until they replace either the contact lens he lost or the eyeglasses he broke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister does not agree with my method, said I'm being petty for getting mad over it and she would rather spend money on food. My mother thinks I'm being harsh considering it will be christmas soon, and that my nephew is still too young to understand what I'm trying to teach him\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt I was right, but now I'm not sure.

You are one of his primary caregivers and you haven\u2019t taught him about consequences to one\u2019s destructive (pattern) of behavior.\n\nAlso, is your home child proof? Things kept out of reach?\n\nInfo: I\u2019m wondering why your contacts weren\u2019t being worn since your glasses were broken? I ask cause I would have to wear one or the other to see (properly). \n\nYou could have told him the first time he damaged something in your home that he would have to skip his next visit as a consequence. He is a kid you care about so a ban seems too much for him to understand as a consequence for something he has regularly gotten away with (by you).\n\nHaving his mom pay may teach her some consequences. So I guess the ban is because she refuses to reimburse you?\n\nSeems the adults are going to have to agree to address your nephews issue of touching and breaking things that don\u2019t belong to him. Decide together how to finally correct the behavior.", "ESH  \nFirst off, 8 years old is old enough to understand the basics of what is a toy and what is not. Someone has failed in teaching him this.\n\nAnd while I understand you are not the parent, but you are an adult and you know his track record and should have taken steps to just taken the lenses away from him.\n\nHis mother should also take responsibility and if not pay all, then some of the values of what he breaks, and the kid desperately needs to learn there are consequences to his actions, tho banning him because neither the mother or you don't have the guts to give him a form of punishment (Like a timeout corner, no game time, do some extra chores) Since you haven't mentioned anything like that, he will never truly learn. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't the case of spilling some milk, he is physically destructive and it will become a problem later its not addressed sooner rather then later.", "NTA, 8 is plenty old to stop being a brat and your mom and his mom both need to stop enabling this behavior.", "NTA, considering the amount of stuff he\u2019s broken over the years. You have every right to not have him at your house anymore until he learns to respect your property. \n\nI\u2019m guessing you and your sister both tried to talk him about it nicely in the past and it didn\u2019t sink in, so consequences are the only way forward at this point.", "ESH\n\nYou are all doing a pretty poor job of raising this child.  He should have been taught not to mess with other people's stuff as soon as he was able to get to it.  You say you've let things go until he was eight\u2014waaaaaay too long.  No wonder he thinks it's fine to break stuff, if it always has been fine.  You, and your sister, and your mother, and any other 'responsible' adult in the kid's life, need to get your act together.", "ESH\n\nShe sucks for leaving you to raise her kid like that, seriously why isn\u2019t she being a mother?\n\nYou are also an asshole because you\u2019ve been raising him as you say, you are therefore the one who waited this long to teach boundaries, you failed and you\u2019re punishing him that you decided not to teach him sooner.\n\nHe sucks because he played with and lost something that you specifically told him not to touch.\n\nSo yeah, everyone sucks here, but again, why are you raising this kid instead of his parents?", "YTA you wait until he is 8 years old to begin teaching him boundaries and going with a really harsh punishment right away", "YTA for waiting until he's 8yo to begin teaching him boundaries. He's gotten away with everything until now and then you punish him with taking away his weekdays home? That's really not fair. The punishment is to harsh. Let him come back but have him work of his debt for the broken things by doing housework for you. He needs to be raised properly.", "INFO: has he broken people's property at school?", "ESH\n\nThe fact dropping him at his own home with his own mother was effectively a punishment is just. Ick. \n\nYou claim to have \u2018practically raised him\u2019 yet blame your sister for the fact he\u2019s careless with your stuff.\n\nAt 8, he\u2019s not too young to learn this stuff. It should have been taught all along.", "Your started teaching the child you are practically raising about boundaries at 8? You never restricted him nor punished him for breaking stuff before? \n\nOf course he is not going to understand that now.... it will take time and effort to learn him something he should have learned long before. \n\nYou did the child a disfavor  and it's coming back to haunt you. \n\nYTA as well as your mom.", "You literally said you chalk it up to him being a kid...how does him being 8 change that? He's still a kid and 8 is waaay too late to start teaching him this, this is a lesson he should have been getting consistently from a younger age.\n\n\nWhen he was playing with your contacts you should have taken them off of him, especially seeing you haven't put any effort into teaching him to be careful with people's belongings before.\n\nYou saw him playing with them and did nothing, replace them yourself. \n\nEsh", "NTA he is 8! He is a school kid and should be plenty able to understand this. He can't go breaking everyone's stuff at school without consequences and the facthe is especially careless with your things shows it's not the concept he doesn't get but that he just thinks it's fune with you. Loosing the lenses after you told him nicely to please not mess with them is just disrespectful.", "ESH - This kid is a product of the environments that raised him. You needed to start teaching him about boundaries and hands-off items *years* ago. Of course he\u2019s having a hard time *now*\u2026he\u2019s had years of conditioning that taught him his actions have no consequences and he can do whatever he wants. Eight years old **should** be old enough to know better but if the adults in his life failed to teach and reinforce these things, how would he know?\n\nOf course he\u2019s wrong for breaking and losing so many things. And you are right to be trying to correct his behavior. But I\u2019d say you are going\u2026from 0 to 100. Again, this is an adjustment because he wasn\u2019t given these boundaries before. I think instead of banning him and making his family pay for the replacement when it sounds like they don\u2019t have much money, it\u2019d be better to buy new contacts and have him come to your house to work off his debt. I think this will show him the consequences more tangibly and teach him some personal responsibility, rather than just having his mom bail him out.", "ESH because ultimately his behavior is on you and your sister. You don\u2019t start teaching boundaries at 8. You say he has no restrictions- you let him get away with everything. \n\nJust a guess but I think you\u2019re trying to compete for more of his affection than his mother by not having rules- being the \u201ccool aunt\u201d, and now you\u2019re reaping what you sowed. The fact that he acts this way more with you is proof.", "This whole situation is fucked up. But given that you have been raising this child, it was up to you to teach him proper behavior. Apparently you failed. You can\u2019t demand sister pay for your contacts now. YTA.", "NTA. My stepdaughter was more considerate when she was 5! 8 is PLENTY old enough to learn about respect for others' belongings and responsibility. Hold your boundaries.", "NTA but at 8 he should be dealing with consequences from his mom as well.", "NTA, you are finally doing what you should have done long ago.\n\nYou're not an asshole because you're not a parent, you were taking care of someone else's kid. However by your words, \"you practically raised this nephew\", and you didn't do a very good job sadly. The good thing is, it's never to late, and you are finally doing it now.\n\nBoundaries are taught young. A child needs to hear the word \"no\" and to understand what to touch and what not to. Breaking cell phones, laptops? That never should have happened, no matter how young (he shouldn't have been allowed to touch those things).\n\nWhen a kid is very young, you can show him you are upset by refusing to play with him. Play time is the biggest reward for a kid, so cutting that for a day (and explaining why) is very educational. A child immediately understands they are in the wrong (that's 4-5 yo).\n\nAt 8yo we're already talking about a big kid. Your choice of banning him from the house is exactly the right move. Stay strong, no matter what your mom and sister say. You are the one finally doing right by this kid. True parenting is about teaching a kid about life, not about raising him into an entitled asshole.", "NTA. She should replace them or keep him under a tighter guard", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to teach this kid boundaries, as he\u2019s not YOUR kid.\n\nIf he can\u2019t follow simple, reasonable instructions in the homes of relatives, that\u2019s on him and his mom to rectify.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He spends so much time with you, and you should have taught him about being obedient and about consequences when he does something he shouldn't do and something gets broken.  That should have started LONG before he turned 8!  And you wonder why he doesn't listen and touches things you tell him not to, then loses or breaks things??!  Because he's learned from you that it's okay and there are no consequences since you've always just written it off as \"he's a kid\" and bought new stuff.  \n\nYour sister is not teaching him those important life skills, either.  She doesn't see it as a priority that he breaks or loses things, because he's been doing that for years!  So, she sees it as no big deal now!\n\nYou need to sit down with your sister and your nephew and set some new boundaries and guidelines that you will enforce and agree that if he damages anything, intentionally or willfully, then there WILL be consequences.  He should pay for the replacement of the contacts that he touched without permission.  But he needs discipline, and that seems to be something he's never had.  Time for all 3 of you to grow up!", "WTF is all I can say for enabling this behavior and are now just realizing the issue here. ESH you and his mother have been enabling and failing him as caregivers. And he sucks because of his actions. But you guys are mostly to blame for his behavior.", "If I've understood your post correctly, this kid lives with you during the week and this, at 8 years old, is the first time there are consequences for him breaking or losing your things, is that accurate? \n\nIf so, you and your sister have really dropped the ball and ESH. He should have been learning about respecting other people's stuff for about 5 years at this point, and he should have had age- and situation- appropriate consequences the whole time.\n\nNow you're suddenly springing a GIANT lifestyle change on him as punishment for something he's never been punished for before. That's not fair.", "NTA - As the father of an 8 year old child, he is perfectly capable of understanding the consequences of his actions. What I\u2019m most confused about is the two adults who have apparently not learned the lessons that there are consequences to actions\u2026your sister and mother. Furthermore, why is he spending all that time at your house and not at his own mother\u2019s place? Where is the father in all of this? \n\nLastly, it might be a good idea to suggest behavioral assessment. My kid is pretty severely ADHD. His impulse control on his meds is lacking at times..without them, he\u2019s out of control. And he doesn\u2019t mean anything by it, he literally just can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s destructive, but not maliciously. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think it\u2019s time for your SISTER to start taking responsibility for her son, and if she can\u2019t accept the consequences of her son\u2019s actions at your place, then you\u2019ll just have to start visiting him on their turf or neutral ground.", ">\tHe has already broken two phones, two eyeglasses, 1 laptop and so many other stuff.\n\nMy kids are six and four and haven\u2019t broken any phones, laptops or other expensive stuff. ESH: You, your sister and your mom need to actually raise are the poor kid, teach and supervise him.\n\n8 years of no consequences and then you cancel Christmas out of the blue? Grow up and show some responsibility.", "NTA. Kid\u2019s fucking with you. It\u2019s find out time.", "NTA. Your sister needs to be more responsible.", "Exactly this. This child has been in the care of OP for most of his life, and still spends most days in their care, so bad parenting habits fall on OP and not on the sister. When my son was not able to talk himself,  he sure already knew what \"no\" means and what he is allowed to touch and what not. I surely would have NOT allowed him to crash things unpunished until he was well along in elementary school.\n\nOP just started to teach boundaries to this kid and is astonished that he doesn't understand this concept after a little while. His whole life he was able to do whatever he liked with OPs stuff and the mother was never asked to replace anything her son broke (while beimg raised by OP), so to turn around and get super mad now does not work.\n\nOP has to understand that she messed up raising her nephew and that there will be more things going to get broken until she has fixed her years of neglecting to teach boundaries and consequences.", "I had several talks to my nephew in the past about his behavior. I told him why he was wrong and that I want him to learn how to make the right decisions, instead of acting out of fear. As a kid I grew up in a environment where every minor things get punished, and I didnt want him to grow in the same kind of environment.\n\nI really thought talking to him would be enough. Apparently it's not. And now I'm not even sure what's the right way to discipline him. I don't have a child of my own, have no previous experience raising a kid, and my own parents are not the best example either. So yes I have no clue but I really want to do my best.\n\nI raised this kid because I earn more and have more flexibility at work. His father is out of the picture.", "I don't let him get away with everything. I talked to him several times in the past about this, it's just that it was never enough to make him more careful or considerate of my stuff, and I'm not comfortable of giving any harsh punishments. Banning him from my place was the only more strict kind of punishment I could think of. \n\nI don't have a child of my own so I'm also not sure when it's the right time to be a bit more strict.", "But she was probably taught to be considerate. This is a kid that gotten away with EVERYTHING until he turned 8 and OP all of a sudden decided to begin teaching him to respect others' belongings and when he fails (because no one has taught hem respect) she takes away his weekdays home! That's really too harsh when he hasn't been raised properly - which isn't his fault!", "He\u2019s with you the majority of the time. In your words, you practically raised him. Harsh punishments wouldn\u2019t be necessary if you consistently enforced boundaries when he was younger.", "The time was at least 6 years ago and \"talking\" about being careful is not enough with children. They have to see immediate consequences to their actions. Your nephew didn't get any consequences for 8 years, punishing him now for not understanding something you failed to teach him does not work. Stop excusing your behavior by saying you don't have a child of your own - you raised this child, no matter if you gave birth, it is your responsibility to learn about how to parent properly.", "Agree! Don't punish the child for behaving like he learned it's okay for 8 years!", "So he gets to stay a brat!? Nope. It\u2019s never too late to learn.", "Exactly. But OP failed to teach this years ago, she can't be mad now that the child does not understand anything that she didn't care to explain for years. Understanding the concept of boundaries now will take time now, it's more difficult to unlearn a behavior that was okay forever."]}
