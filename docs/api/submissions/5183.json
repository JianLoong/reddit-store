My sister (28f)  used to work afar so she had to leave him at my / my mother's care when he was a baby. Three years ago she found a job and house nearby, but my nephew still spends his weekdays in my place and only goes at my sister's place during the weekends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy nephew tends to be careless with everyone's stuff, but he's specially careless with mine. I think because he's closest to me and has no restrictions. He has already broken two phones, two eyeglasses, 1 laptop and so many other stuff. I chalk it up to him being a kid and therefore never gets mad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut when he turned 8, I started teaching him about boundaries. That when I tell him something is hands-off, then he must not play with it. A concept he's really having a hard time with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday I saw him fiddling with the contact lenses I just bought the other day. I told him it's a hands-off because I will need to wear it for an office party later, and that I wouldn't have any backup because he just broke my eyeglasses. An hour before the party, all I have to do is wear my contact lenses... et voila! It's missing. When I asked my nephew, he admitted to have dropped it. We looked for it to no avail, and I ended up not being able to go to the office party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the only time I got really mad. I got mad that he didn't listen to me for the nth time and that he didn't even bother picking it up after dropping it, because to me that shows his lack of respect to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSure I can buy a new pair again just like what I've done several times in the past, but I really wanted to teach him a lesson about boundaries and respect, and in my perspective, the best way to do that is show him the consequences. So, I dropped him to his mom afterwards and told both of them that he will be banned at my place until they replace either the contact lens he lost or the eyeglasses he broke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister does not agree with my method, said I'm being petty for getting mad over it and she would rather spend money on food. My mother thinks I'm being harsh considering it will be christmas soon, and that my nephew is still too young to understand what I'm trying to teach him\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt I was right, but now I'm not sure. AITA for banning my 8yo nephew to teach him about consequences, considering that it will be Christmas soon?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\*\n\nThank you to all who gave their feedback. I just talked to my nephew and he agreed to write a whole-page essay to reflect about his actions, and to wash the plates at home for two weeks to pay for what he lost.\n\nI agree that banning him from my place might be too harsh, but to clarify, it isn't like I didn't try to talk to him or discipline gently when he was younger. His habit has mellowed down towards other people's stuff but not towards mine, which I conclude is because of his total lack of fear of me. I am not fond of punishments / discipline by fear because I grew up from that kind of environment. I  think I want to be his security blanket because I didn't have one growing up, but it can be a struggle to balance things out.\n\nAppreciate all those who gave their advice!\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1671521123, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqhupa/aita_for_banning_my_8yo_nephew_from_my_place/", "score": 180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Things kept out of reach?\n\nInfo: I\u2019m wondering why your contacts weren\u2019t being worn since your glasses were broken? I ask cause I would have to wear one or the other to see (properly). \n\nYou could have told him the first time he damaged something in your home that he would have to skip his next visit as a consequence. He is a kid you care about so a ban seems too much for him to understand as a consequence for something he has regularly gotten away with (by you).\n\nHaving his mom pay may teach her some consequences. So I guess the ban is because she refuses to reimburse you?\n\nSeems the adults are going to have to agree to address your nephews issue of touching and breaking things that don\u2019t belong to him. Decide together how to finally correct the behavior.", "ESH  \nFirst off, 8 years old is old enough to understand the basics of what is a toy and what is not. Someone has failed in teaching him this.\n\nAnd while I understand you are not the parent, but you are an adult and you know his track record and should have taken steps to just taken the lenses away from him.\n\nHis mother should also take responsibility and if not pay all, then some of the values of what he breaks, and the kid desperately needs to learn there are consequences to his actions, tho banning him is a bit overkill because neither the mother or you don't have the guts to give him a form of punishment (Like a timeout corner, no game time, do some extra chores)  (You haven't mentioned anything any punishment, ony a \"command word\" that apariantly is not enforced or punished, so he will never truly learn)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't the case of spilling some milk, he is physically destructive and it will become a problem eventually its not addressed sooner rather then later.\n\nEdidet to clean up some sentences and a typo", "NTA, 8 is plenty old to stop being a brat and your mom and his mom both need to stop enabling this behavior.", "NTA, considering the amount of stuff he\u2019s broken over the years.

No wonder he thinks it's fine to break stuff, if it always has been fine.  You, and your sister, and your mother, and any other 'responsible' adult in the kid's life, need to get your act together.", "ESH\n\nShe sucks for leaving you to raise her kid like that, seriously why isn\u2019t she being a mother?\n\nYou are also an asshole because you\u2019ve been raising him as you say, you are therefore the one who waited this long to teach boundaries, you failed and you\u2019re punishing him that you decided not to teach him sooner.\n\nHe sucks because he played with and lost something that you specifically told him not to touch.\n\nSo yeah, everyone sucks here, but again, why are you raising this kid instead of his parents?", "YTA you wait until he is 8 years old to begin teaching him boundaries and going with a really harsh punishment right away", "YTA for waiting until he's 8yo to begin teaching him boundaries. He's gotten away with everything until now and then you punish him with taking away his weekdays home? That's really not fair. The punishment is to harsh.

He's still a kid and 8 is waaay too late to start teaching him this, this is a lesson he should have been getting consistently from a younger age.\n\n\nWhen he was playing with your contacts you should have taken them off of him, especially seeing you haven't put any effort into teaching him to be careful with people's belongings before.\n\nYou saw him playing with them and did nothing, replace them yourself. \n\nEsh", "NTA he is 8! He is a school kid and should be plenty able to understand this. He can't go breaking everyone's stuff at school without consequences and the facthe is especially careless with your things shows it's not the concept he doesn't get but that he just thinks it's fune with you. Loosing the lenses after you told him nicely to please not mess with them is just disrespectful.", "ESH - This kid is a product of the environments that raised him. You needed to start teaching him about boundaries and hands-off items *years* ago. Of course he\u2019s having a hard time *now*\u2026he\u2019s had years of conditioning that taught him his actions have no consequences and he can do whatever he wants. Eight years old **should** be old enough to know better but if the adults in his life failed to teach and reinforce these things, how would he know?\n\nOf course he\u2019s wrong for breaking and losing so many things. And you are right to be trying to correct his behavior. But I\u2019d say you are going\u2026from 0 to 100. Again, this is an adjustment because he wasn\u2019t given these boundaries before. I think instead of banning him and making his family pay for the replacement when it sounds like they don\u2019t have much money, it\u2019d be better to buy new contacts and have him come to your house to work off his debt. I think this will show him the consequences more tangibly and teach him some personal responsibility, rather than just having his mom bail him out.", "ESH because ultimately his behavior is on you and your sister. You don\u2019t start teaching boundaries at 8. You say he has no restrictions- you let him get away with everything. \n\nJust a guess but I think you\u2019re trying to compete for more of his affection than his mother by not having rules- being the \u201ccool aunt\u201d, and now you\u2019re reaping what you sowed. The fact that he acts this way more with you is proof.", "This whole situation is fucked up. But given that you have been raising this child, it was up to you to teach him proper behavior. Apparently you failed. You can\u2019t demand sister pay for your contacts now. YTA.", "NTA. My stepdaughter was more considerate when she was 5! 8 is PLENTY old enough to learn about respect for others' belongings and responsibility. Hold your boundaries.", "NTA but at 8 he should be dealing with consequences from his mom as well.", "NTA, you are finally doing what you should have done long ago.\n\nYou're not an asshole because you're not a parent, you were taking care of someone else's kid. However by your words, \"you practically raised this nephew\", and you didn't do a very good job sadly. The good thing is, it's never to late, and you are finally doing it now.\n\nBoundaries are taught young. A child needs to hear the word \"no\" and to understand what to touch and what not to. Breaking cell phones, laptops? That never should have happened, no matter how young (he shouldn't have been allowed to touch those things).\n\nWhen a kid is very young, you can show him you are upset by refusing to play with him. Play time is the biggest reward for a kid, so cutting that for a day (and explaining why) is very educational. A child immediately understands they are in the wrong (that's 4-5 yo).\n\nAt 8yo we're already talking about a big kid. Your choice of banning him from the house is exactly the right move. Stay strong, no matter what your mom and sister say. You are the one finally doing right by this kid. True parenting is about teaching a kid about life, not about raising him into an entitled asshole.", "NTA. She should replace them or keep him under a tighter guard", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to teach this kid boundaries, as he\u2019s not YOUR kid.\n\nIf he can\u2019t follow simple, reasonable instructions in the homes of relatives, that\u2019s on him and his mom to rectify.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He spends so much time with you, and you should have taught him about being obedient and about consequences when he does something he shouldn't do and something gets broken.  That should have started LONG before he turned 8!  And you wonder why he doesn't listen and touches things you tell him not to, then loses or breaks things??!  Because he's learned from you that it's okay and there are no consequences since you've always just written it off as \"he's a kid\" and bought new stuff.  \n\nYour sister is not teaching him those important life skills, either.  She doesn't see it as a priority that he breaks or loses things, because he's been doing that for years!  So, she sees it as no big deal now!\n\nYou need to sit down with your sister and your nephew and set some new boundaries and guidelines that you will enforce and agree that if he damages anything, intentionally or willfully, then there WILL be consequences.  He should pay for the replacement of the contacts that he touched without permission.  But he needs discipline, and that seems to be something he's never had.  Time for all 3 of you to grow up!", "WTF is all I can say for enabling this behavior and are now just realizing the issue here. ESH you and his mother have been enabling and failing him as caregivers. And he sucks because of his actions. But you guys are mostly to blame for his behavior.", "If I've understood your post correctly, this kid lives with you during the week and this, at 8 years old, is the first time there are consequences for him breaking or losing your things, is that accurate? \n\nIf so, you and your sister have really dropped the ball and ESH. He should have been learning about respecting other people's stuff for about 5 years at this point, and he should have had age- and situation- appropriate consequences the whole time.\n\nNow you're suddenly springing a GIANT lifestyle change on him as punishment for something he's never been punished for before. That's not fair.", "NTA - As the father of an 8 year old child, he is perfectly capable of understanding the consequences of his actions. What I\u2019m most confused about is the two adults who have apparently not learned the lessons that there are consequences to actions\u2026your sister and mother. Furthermore, why is he spending all that time at your house and not at his own mother\u2019s place? Where is the father in all of this? \n\nLastly, it might be a good idea to suggest behavioral assessment. My kid is pretty severely ADHD. His impulse control on his meds is lacking at times..without them, he\u2019s out of control. And he doesn\u2019t mean anything by it, he literally just can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s destructive, but not maliciously. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think it\u2019s time for your SISTER to start taking responsibility for her son, and if she can\u2019t accept the consequences of her son\u2019s actions at your place, then you\u2019ll just have to start visiting him on their turf or neutral ground.", ">\tHe has already broken two phones, two eyeglasses, 1 laptop and so many other stuff.\n\nMy kids are six and four and haven\u2019t broken any phones, laptops or other expensive stuff.

This child has been in the care of OP for most of his life, and still spends most days in their care, so bad parenting habits fall on OP and not on the sister.

I surely would have NOT allowed him to crash things unpunished until he was well along in elementary school.\n\nOP just started to teach boundaries to this kid and is astonished that he doesn't understand this concept after a little while. His whole life he was able to do whatever he liked with OPs stuff and the mother was never asked to replace anything her son broke (while beimg raised by OP), so to turn around and get super mad now does not work.\n\nOP has to understand that she messed up raising her nephew and that there will be more things going to get broken until she has fixed her years of neglecting to teach boundaries and consequences.", "I had several talks to my nephew in the past about his behavior. I told him why he was wrong and that I want him to learn how to make the right decisions, instead of acting out of fear. As a kid I grew up in a environment where every minor things get punished, and I didnt want him to grow in the same kind of environment.\n\nI really thought talking to him would be enough. Apparently it's not. And now I'm not even sure what's the right way to discipline him. I don't have a child of my own, have no previous experience raising a kid, and my own parents are not the best example either.

Harsh punishments wouldn\u2019t be necessary if you consistently enforced boundaries when he was younger.", "The time was at least 6 years ago and \"talking\" about being careful is not enough with children. They have to see immediate consequences to their actions. Your nephew didn't get any consequences for 8 years, punishing him now for not understanding something you failed to teach him does not work.

You raised him and even now have him 5 days of the week. It's like backing your own kid from coming home to teach a lesson. A lesson you should have been teaching since the issues started. You didn't get mad before because \"he's just a kid\" but how would he learn? You can still give it consequences without being mad. \n\nYou enabled this behavior and are only choosing now to punish it because now it was important.", "NTA", "ESH, by 8 children have more than the concept of how not to destroy other peoples things. The fact is that none of the adults in his life did this, choosing instead to indulge and enable his behaviors from a young age. You are going to have to have a much bigger and stronger spine to not only set reasonable boundaries but also reasonable consequences such as doing chores to earn money to help pay for what he has damaged. And you are not going to just use your words either, when you see him things you have told him not to touch you take it away from him and move it out of his reach until he starts respecting you and your things. You have to follow your words by actions, you don't which is why he continues to push the boundaries you put in place. He knows that you won't really enforce them, and you are wrong for doing this. You may be his aunt, but you have taken on the primary parenting role with him and so far you're still acting like an indulgent aunt instead of the parent he needs.", "NTA \n\nYou did nothing wrong. Your sister is spoiling him and teaching him he can get away with everything.\n\nHe needs to learn about boundaries and consequences, now that his character is still evolving. Once he hits puberty... game over.", "ESH, starting to teach boundaries at 8 is way too late. My first step was when my kids were babies, they would smack my face (without malice) and I'd take their hand and stroke my cheek gently and say \"gentle hands\". When my five year old threw the gaming remote in fury over losing I took it away (it wasn't broken), telling her she could start using it again when I could trust her to control herself, it took about a month, she asked several times and I told her I wasn't sure, when she finally got it back and got frustrated over loosing a game I could see her visibly stopping herself from throwing it.\n\nMy kids are bigger now, and they are respectful of other people's stuff. Your nephew is not too young to learn boundaries, I'd say boundary teaching started too late, it's just about finding an age appropriate way of doing it. It's like you went from nothing to nuclear, that's got to be confusing for him.", "I would just softly caution you to be careful banning him from your house. For better or worse, you are a parental figure to him. With his mum in and out for long periods, you are the only real marker of stability he has had. Kicking him out of your house may cause him to have abandonment issues down the road, or associate his mistakes with you not wanting him rather than as just a punishment.", "ESH except the kid. I fear you have left it too late to tell the child hands off. Things like phones, laptops, expensive things should have been of his reach, told no, or supervised when using. You have been a primary care taker for this child since he was very young, and now you are changing the rules.", "I haven't tried extra chores or timeout corner, but I have grounded him / restricted game time in the past. His mother and I have talked to him about his behavior before, and he started being more careful with other's stuff. Just not mine. That's how I concluded that it could be because we're too close, he doesn't believe I could get mad at him, so he continues breaking and losing my stuff.\n\nI can accept being the asshole. But most of the YTA comments are just stating their opinions without any recommendation. I mean, fine, so you think I did poor in raising the kid. What do you suggest I do specifically in this case?", "Age 8 is probably in 3rd grade. You think now is the time to begin teaching conduct? Should have happened 5 years ago.", "Agreed. Chalking it up to being a kid is something you do with kids who are being raised by other people- it\u2019s when you trust that he is being taught better, but he\u2019s still learning.

Banning him from my place is how I'm trying to show responsibility by teaching him consequences. I'm not cancelling Christmas. Christmas will still be celebrated, he just has to go home to his mom instead of my place.\n\nWhat are the consequences do you have in mind?", "Well, have a serious talk with him (perhaps talk to his mother beforehand and agree on what to say and what punishment to have) where you explaining to him that you are hurt that he is breaking your stuff and this will not be acceptable going forward. \nSay something to the effect of he is a young man now, and must be more aware of his strength so he has to be more careful. However, should he break something expensive because of carelessness, he will have to help pay it back. \nThis is what my mom had my brother do, his allowance went toward fixing a car door for months, he got around 100Nok (around 10 euros) that my mom showed him the bill and put it in a box marked car door and marked how much was in it each time. I think this went on for a couple of months. \n\n\nIf he don't get a allowance but you can afford it, maybe start doing some physical activity with him. Say if he manages to not break anything when visiting, one a week/twice a month you will take him to some sort of activity center. (climbing, bowling whatever) \nRewards is as important as punishments. He is a growing boy, might enjoy testing his strengths. \n\n\nIf after all this he continues to regularly break you stuff, make it very clear that he will not be allowed to visit for x amount of time, and that the time will be determined on if it was intentional (in a fit of rage for example) expensiveness (if he breaks glasses, pc's)\n\n\nJust a few suggestions at least.\n\nEdit to add: perhaps make sure that he understands being banned from the apartment does not equal you not wanting to see him, he could just be a clumsy child like me and some of this is genuine accidents, and him feeling you don't like him because of that don't seem fair.", "You're not doing anything irresponsible, dangerous or harmful so I would kick my feet up and wait for my reimbursement. You seem like the only person with any sense on how to raise a child anyways. Consequences are important and yours aren't even harsh lmao. NTA", ">I had several talks to my nephew in the past about his behavior. I told him why he was wrong and that I want him to learn how to make the right decisions, instead of acting out of fear. As a kid I grew up in a environment where every minor things get punished, and I didnt want him to grow in the same kind of environment.\n\nThere's a saying - Generals always fight the last war. That is to say, they are so fixated on avoiding the mistakes and implementing lessons learned from the  last major war, that they make new mistakes and people die, because they can't adapt to the war that is happening in front of them.\n\nThere are plenty of good resources on parenting and appropriate discipline out there.\n\nUnderstanding of consequences is important. In the real world you can get fired, you can destroy a friendship, you can go to jail, you can go into debt.\n\nYou are worried about \"acting out of fear\", but a healthy respect for consequences will keep you safe as an adult, and instilling that respect will help keep them safe and healthy (and also others around them too)\n\nGood luck!", "I highly recommend checking out the videos by Mr Chazz. It's a great primer in a disciplinary method that isn't about punishment OR permissiveness. The book Discipline Without Damage is great too. \n\nWhat you were doing was not having boundaries so he did whatever.\n\nWhat you are trying now will make him feel like a primary parental figure is suddenly rejecting his presence in your life because he broke something which can really mess a kid up. \n\nWhat you need to do is learn to set boundaries, help create natural consequences like cleaning up or helping repair things, remove his access to stuff he isn't mature enough to leave alone, and teach him skills to help manage his own behavior by identifying the need the behavior is expressing and helping him find acceptable ways to meet it. Some of this you will have to apply at the toddler level because he missed it originally. \n\nIt's really hard to learn a new way, especially because your instincts will be to follow your parents'examples, but you will both be happier and healthier for it. You can do it.", "It\u2019s not bad to punish the kids in civil way without abusing and using violence. Our 6 and 4 year olds are far well behaved than your 8 year old nephew! My son and daughter never breaks anything. They don\u2019t touch our office and personal laptops. Don\u2019t play with our mobiles. Never touch my eyeglasses or contact lenses. I never had to punish to teach them these should not be touched by them. They are allowed to break toys accidentally because that is normal foe the kids. I don\u2019t blame OP as she is not his mom, mom should be the one teaching all these!", "But you DO have a child of your own! YOU raised him, he lives with YOU the majority of the time, YOU have him for the weekdays when there's school and activities, he's only with his mother during the week-ends. This makes YOU his primary parent!\n\nYou say your not comfortable of giving any harsh punishment, but banning him from his primary HOME is really a very harsh punishment!\n\nYou can't just talk to most children about their actions, you need to show them how things are done.\n\nFor example, you saw him playing with your contacts, you asked him to stop but he didn't. Then you just take them away from him!\n\nIf he breaks something, have him help cleaning it up, tell him how much it costs to replace, translate it into things he likes. My kids gets an allowance every week, we translate things into how many weeks it will take them to earn it. When our 8yo cut up a table cloth we took from her money to replace it (and her sister got to choose the new one).\n\nIf he looses something, then you look for it and until it's found, you take away TV or games or what ever the thing he enjoys until you find the missing item.\n\nHaving him replace something he's broken or taking away TV until he found something he lost is NOT harsh punishment. Kicking an 8yo out of your house for loosing something you saw him play with but didn't take away from him. That IS harsh punishment.\n\nIt's great that you want him to be more responsible, it should have happened sooner but now is better than never. But you need to follow up the talks with some immediate reasonable consequences.  \n\n\nEdit: Fixed spelling", "Any time he crosses a boundary is the right time to level a consequence, and the severity should not exceed the severity of the offense.  I recommend reading Parenting with Love and Logic.  Teachers use this resource a lot, but it\u2019s really effective for parenting in general.", "I've never punished my kids, but I've always been very consistent about consequences. The difference is that consequences are directly tied to what happened, ie if a young kid breaks something they don't get to play with anything breakable until I can trust them to be careful, and its on me to keep those things out of reach. If an older kid breaks something they have to compensate the owner in an appropriate way. \n\nHow you describe your relationship you're basically a surrogate parent, in that context you need to consider the consequence differently than if this had happened at a friend's house. To me banning him from your place is withholding love, that's very harsh for an 8-year old. He has demonstrated that he can't be trusted not to break things, so you need to keep anything you care about being broken out of his reach, and then you need to find a way for him to compensate you for the contacts.", "Why was he able to get hold of the lenses again?\n\nYou said yourself he has no restrictions: You need to set some up and enforce them.\n\nYou explained to him when he turned 8 ( which is 6.5 years to late) what boundaries are but what were the consequences for him when it happened?\n\nIt seems that for 8 years nothing was done and now you\u2019re surprised.", "Children have short attention spans. They can't plan or anticipate future consequences You know this. So punishments are short and immediate. An abstract and long term punishment, like banning visits, is the opposite of this.\n\nTime out is a perfect example. He does bad thing now, he's got to sit in the corner and be bored for five minutes.\n\nBanning visits is too abstract and involving long term thinking for kids.", "Thanks, I think I'll make him do chores at home to pay back what he lost. His only chore at home is to wash his own plate, so making him do more might send a clearer message.\n\nI already take him to the mall / playground / resort every other week because this is how we bond, so I don't think he will see it as a reward.", "Thank you this is helpful! Will check it out.", "Awesome, maybe he will apriciate the value in items going forward!\n\nGood luck!", "Of course he can learn but going from never being corrected for his bad behaviour to being banned from her house just because he turned 8 and is \"old enough to know better\" when no one has bothered teaching him IS too harsh. Have him do chores to work of hus debt would have been a much more fitting punishment. Immidiately take away things when she she sees him play with them. But kick him out and ban him from his weekdays home? No!!!", "Why are you raising your sister's kid?", "NTA\n\nY\u2019all don\u2019t realize that the sister has been using OP as free day care? The sister has a new job and lives nearby yet the nephew spends 5 days of the week at OP\u2019s? Why? Because he seems to like it there more? \n\nYet everyone is saying yta/esh. Where is the mother in this? OP is just asking for compensation for glasses. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize OP was being paid to be a parent. She\u2019s not the kid\u2019s nanny. She may be the aunt and she probably helped out her sister because she\u2019s \u2018family.\u2019 Gosh. I hate family obligation because you\u2019re family. \n\n\u2018You are also an asshole because you\u2019ve been raising him\u2026 you are therefore [an asshole as you are] the one who waited this long\u2026 you failed and you\u2019re punishing him that you decided not to teach him sooner.\u2019\nWhile I understand OP may have raising this child for most of his life (she probably didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter), the sister has been neglectful in raising her own child. She has been absent, uninvolved and has been indifferent towards the child\u2019s emotional and behavioral needs for probably most of his life. Because of this, OP had to step in and eventually become an authorative parental figure that he needs; meaning she\u2019s had to set rules, boundaries with clear expectations. The consequences? They were dropped off at their parents and barred from returning until probably a sincere apology and probably some sort compensation, as in a means to say that OP means business. Just because she can afford to replace them herself, doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no consequences due to his actions.\n\nAnd everyone saying OP is asshole for not punishing / disciplining the child earlier on in life? For what? Accidentally breaking or losing something when they were like, what 4 or 5? They\u2019re not gonna understand what you\u2019re saying or doing. They can understand that OP is upset about it but the child will continue to move on like any old day. OP has had multiple conversations with said child. Yet they repeat their mistakes. This has been brought up to the mother multiple times. The mother is not discussing with and disciplining her child. You know how often parents get angry at another adult who disciplines a child that is not theirs? OP has set boundaries and they\u2019re not being respected. Why is it OP\u2019s responsibility to discipline and raise a child that\u2019s not hers?\n\nOP grew up in an environment where minor things were punishable. OP did not want that for her nephew. OP is being an actual adult and treating her nephew with respect. She has probably talked about his actions with him in the past but is probably being more firm the older he has gotten. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s at her limit and doesn\u2019t know what to do anymore. Y\u2019all acting like she hasn\u2019t done anything for years. Her communication isn\u2019t getting through to him\n\nThe grandmother and the sister are both asses in this case. Don\u2019t use the holidays and being family to justify your actions for poor parenting. Your sister is mad that she\u2019s losing free day care from my perspective. If it\u2019s an issue for the grandma, nephew can spend 5 days a week at grandma\u2019s then. OP can visit during the holidays. The holidays aren\u2019t being canceled.\n\nIf the child asks why they\u2019re not seeing their favorite aunt as much, the mother can explain that his actions has consequences and until he understands that, OP\u2019s place is off the table\n\nOP has asked for suggestions but yet none of you have given her a reasonable one\n\nTime out? For five minutes? What is that gonna teach him besides the fact that he might be more agitated since he hasn\u2019t been disciplined up until now?\n\nA time out should be used as a time for reflection, not punishment. This would be a great opportunity to remind them of their behavior and what is expected of them; that is the purpose of a time out\n\nI applaud you for putting your foot down", "NTA. No one needs a wrecking ball in their home.", "NTA\n\nYou are raising your nephew half the week and your sister had no accountability for his actions or to teach him to behave. Has she ever replaced anything else he's damaged or lost?\n\nThis is a completely reasonable response, don't let them guilt you into caring for him until you are ready", "So you have physical custody (of course not legal custody) of him through the week and he doesn't go to his mom's until the weekend? And you're saying you basically raised him and this is how he turned out? That sounds like a you problem. You have taken a responsibility of raising your nephew whether it is your responsibility or not. You need to take the consequences as well. YTA", "I'm glad to see that you realized how overboard that sort of punishment was, especially towards a child that young. It definitely made YTA. As it was overkill and didn't really teach your nephew anything. Not directly anyway.", "NTA. You learn at 3 or 4 about being gentle/careful with things. Other peoples things that they share with you, petting animals gently etc. An 8 year old show KNOW how to take care of other people's things.", "NTA.  If others feel you are wrong, let them raise your nephew their way.  Enuf is enuf.  8 yrs old is old enuf to understand consequences.  Of course others are upset coz it means THEY will have to step in and do THEIR job of raising this child.", "Yta - if you practically raised him than you instilled these behaviors in him. Good job.", "I'm just super confused who sees a child \"fiddling with contacts\" and doesn't take them?\n\nThr letter sort of doesn't make sense to me because you don't really \"break\" contacts.  They hang out either in their small bubble package or case and NO ONE should be touching the actual contacts at all except when necessary.\n\nThere are hard contacts but they're rare these days.  I only know one person who has them and she has a rare eye issue that can't be addressed normally.", "My oldest have actually broken two pair of my glasses. Once when she was a baby and just grabbed them when I had her on my lap. Once by accident when she was a toddler. Both of the kids have also bent kids glasses the wrong way but only once. Things WILL get broken when you have kids. You can't stop everything. But you teach them. If they're small, than you put things out of reach for them and if they're older you talk to them about accidents and if it happens again - then there's consequences, like replacing them, doing extra shores, etc. But you don't kick an 8yo out of his home over broken or lost items!"]}
