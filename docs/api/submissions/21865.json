I'm unsure how chores work out, but at least something towards your portion of the utilities and mortgage or rent will help your parents manage the household and reduce financial stress all around. If they demand all of it, tho, that's definitely not ok. I recommend sitting down and writing your own budget of what you can afford.

(These numbers can change based on family need and the cheque amount, so take this with a grain of salt)\n\nIt's sort of seen as payback for all the things the family will do for the guy just for being a guy and second, to have him know what it's like to spend money on family (ig its for him to be prepared for future marriage).\n\nJust to say this ONLY happens for the first paycheque, never after.\n\nBut if you're a girl nobody under any circumstance has the right to your money, and I do not know of any culture that takes the girls money, nor does the religion support this.\n\nAlso you're mom is asking for it so she can be the keeper not like it's some family/cultural tradition, so I would just ignore it really.
