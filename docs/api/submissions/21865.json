An example of the top of my head would be every working man must give their pay to their wives to delegate and if they do not have a spouse half their pay goes towards women only orphanages or shelters.   Having a society that props the comfort and care of women over men.", "you really don't want to start that war on whose holy book has the more fucked up text.", "That's the purpose of religion.", "That's kind of the issue with organised religion. I had a friend who used Islam as a means to justify his feckless bigotry... lo and behold, he was only my friend until he revealed himself to be an Andrew Tate fan. It's f\\*cking insane.", "My (Muslim) household is not at all like this either. My parents are 100% paying for my college, and my dad worked with me to set up a Roth IRA and an investment account so I can be in a financially good position. I am an only daughter from a reasonably traditional family - doesn\u2019t mean they treat me lesser in any way. Bad eggs and good eggs everywhere.", "No, it quite literally is and this is a vague and disgusting generalization about the majority of the planet.\n\nCharismatic and reactionary people use institutions of power to benefit themselves and they will find a mask anywhere. We quite literally saw these people using the New Atheism movement as a mask to create their own ability to project power onto others using claims on secularism and their own interpretations for personal gain, at the cost of others and I say this as an atheist.\n\nIt is ironic when people, such as yourself, make hasty and misinformed generalizations against religion and the religious, directing your frustrations at the wrong target and allowing people to exploit your simplistic and reductive worldviews against you for themselves.", "That's an issue with reactionaries and some people's subconscious desire to yield power over others, not with organized religion.\n\nReactionaries will find any justification in any place, to justify their behaviors and avoid accountability. We saw this in the Skeptic movement with Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens.\n\nThe problem is that reactionary people have a means to exist power over others with little accountability, not that people are organized along a common set of broad values.", "Any organised movement dictating moral value ultimately has that issue though, whereas individuals practicing bigotry can more easily be held accountable for their bigotry outside of their natural environment. The so-called Sceptic movement just involves a bunch of self-interested people seeking to propagate the values of that self-interest onto others. This is something organised religion can and has done as well. I\u2019m not putting one over the other, but I feel like both indicate a core problem with the organisation of such ideologies. I recognise that these so-called Sceptical Atheists have become quite dogmatic themselves, propagating the Dogma of science, which is inherently disingenuous to the latter practices as it is an unbiased methodology rather than some facilitator of absolute truths.", "Eh. Muslim rulers in India basically used to compete to see who could kill the most Indians. Most of them seemed to average around the 20 million mark.", "And the British killed millions and millions of Indians as well? Not necessarily anything to do with religion, just bad people doing horrific things.", "And? IF Islam has a smaller body count than Christianity, it is only because Islam is only 600 years old whilst Christianity has been around for almost 2000 years.", "NTA. Set up a situation where you pay your parents room and board if that works for you, but you're an adult, and you need to be in control of your own finances \n\nI get that it may be a cultural thing, but it used to be kind of the same in North American culture up until the 60s or even 70s, where first the parents and then the husband controlled all the money. End result was a lot of women ended up ignorant about finances, and when they ended up as divorcees or widows, they also ended up in severe financial difficulty.", "NTA you aren\u2019t a world class football player marrying an older woman, and needs to protect your assets by giving all your earnings to your mother for safe keeping. That\u2019s the benefit many Muslim families do this. However you don\u2019t fit the situation, so go enjoy your money.", "I split it, 1/3 in my savings, 1/3 to spend, and 1/3 to my parents.\nNow my Dad stole my savings as well, but i thought on principle it was a fair compromise.", "Info: \"I can't live by myself yet\" why, because your religion says? Because mom says? Because the law says? Because if it's not 3, then like.....yes you can.", "NTA\n\nYou should probably disclose whether or not its legal for you to live alone or if its purely a religious thing. There is a huge and relevant difference.", "NTA But you really can leave. They don't own you. You are a  whole person. Leave so that it doesn't get so bad that you make a bad marriage just to get away. Also, have your pay deposited in an account at a bank tour mother knows nothing  about. And save, save, save so you can get free.", "Maybe she wants to save your money for you? Does money burn a hole in your pocket? I mean I would just tell her that you want to learn how to save on your own and greatly appreciate the help to avoid conflict. I wouldn\u2019t think less of her like she wants to steal your money though.", "A lot of Muslim households forget Islam when it comes to raising kids. For eg, it's 100% haram (prohibited) to compare your children to others and I tell my parents that always but nope.  NTA", "I would just quit work and go back to school. Probably a school far away from home.", "But why? What do they think will happen vs a man living alone?\n\nIs it because men could make your dirty? Doesn't that mean that men should be hidden from the world until they behave better?\n\nIt sounds weird when you flip it around.\n\nEDIT: When you think about it, women are more suited to living alone. We're socialised to wash dishes, do laundry, clean up after ourselves.", "It's not just Muslim households. I'm a Hindu and my parents tried to pull the same stuff on me. Only in my case, my parents were expecting me to hand over my salary to my aunt because that is who I was living with and then expected to ask for money every time I needed it, with explanations to be given for what the money was for each time.", "I'm not comparing whose gets the worst texts, I'm saying Islam as written is sexist :)", ">Not every Islamic household is like this.\n\nThen those households have purposefully ignored Islam on those points. Good.  \n\nThis doesn't mean sexism is not baked in its holy texts.", "Muslim woman here too. My parents devoted every minute of their lives to better mine, my dad stayed up all night with me helping me with my homework when i needed help, and when  i started working they never asked me for a cent. They gave me their lives savings for the down payment on my house. Their money is in my country of origin\u2019s currency which is a third world country. So no , not all Muslims families are misogynistic. If anything my family is a million times better than those if 90% of redditors here", ">Bad eggs and good eggs everywhere.\n\n... you want to bring out statistics about most of the worlds muslims? Because this will not go well...\n\nI'm not specifically singling out muslims, btw, most popular religions are sexist, but here commenter is talking about Islam.", "Ok, first that\u2019s definitely wrong. The last Muslim ruler of india was deposed in 1857. At that time the population of India was 200 million. You are claiming that multiple rulers murdered 10% of the population of 1857?\n\nSecond, do you want to name all of the genocides and wars that Christian\u2019s have been responsible for? Because toe to toe, no religion will out do Christianity for pure brutality and destructiveness. \n\nJust to name a few:\n1) Multiple crusades where the Christians slaughtered all residents of the cities they conquered \n2) multiple Jewish pogroms\n3) multiple inquisitions, the Spanish Inquisition being the most famous\n4) the French wars of religion \n5) the thirty years war\n6) chattel slavery & the Atlantic slave trade\n7) genocide of indigenous populations of North America, South America, and Australia. \n\nSo no, people pervert religion. None of the three Abrahamic religions are inherently violent or evil. It\u2019s the people who practice them that can pervert the true meanings.", "Muslim girls I know live on their own. And they handle their own money. If you give your mom something to help out that\u2019s one thing. But she should not expect you  to fork over your paycheck and ask for your money back when you want some. You are actually an adult. You need to learn how to handle your own money. It\u2019s a life skill.", "NTA, they are trying to keep you dependent. But with this cultural stuff, ask your community rather than americanized reddit. For instance, if you want to stay in your community, rebelling against this might do you more harm than good.", "NTA you need to save you money so you can move out and get away from that.", "That's your money. Not hers. She just wants to police over you more.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like a very antiquated way of thinking that is meant to keep young people, especially women, under a thumb. It is your money, as long as you contribute however you can and they are not struggling by still having you in the home then you should not have to give up what you work to get, especially if its because of them you are staying.", "NTA. My grandmother tried this, I laughed at her and moved in with my mom. I paid rent but I was never prepared to just handover my salary.", "nta", "You should be paying her money towards rent and utilities as a working adult living in the house. This shouldn't even be close to your full salary. \n\nNTA", "What a fucking weird ass question.", "I would say this is not just a Muslim thing, it is also cultural and can happen in other religions as well. I'm from India and there can be an expectation of surrendering the salary into the family income pool especially in multigenerational households.", "Gotta love nondenominational southern christians too", "Ah yes, famously the only religion to ever say patriarchal shit about women. /s", "Yeah calm the hell down and stop generalising. The rules in Saudi are not the rules everywhere.", "This is not nearly the gotcha you think it is.\n\nMost popular religions are *terrible* against women, and encourage sexism.\n\nThe problem is the religion.", "Sure, but commenter started it first by going all #NotAllMuslims :).", "That would be a lot of mental gymnastics to justify a blatantly sexist text.", "Not by a long shot... I'm middle eastern and have had friends in Saudi Arabia who couldn't do anything they wanted due to the culture there. I'm all for freedom of religion but islam has aged horribly and definitely needs to change a ton of traditions"]}
