Some think it\u2019s gross and disrespectful. Others find it cool, fascinating, and respectful. I know people of both varieties and wouldn\u2019t presume a stance. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t actively want a pet taxidermied and don\u2019t know how I\u2019d feel if a person asked, but emotions aside, the idea of the body having *some* use or meaning to someone makes it seem like less wasteful than other options. But of course this is a case where emotions are inherently involved. \n\nOn the other hand, I can see why your gf is upset and hurt. She wasn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t think clearly, probably didn\u2019t even consider this possibility to know how she felt about it, etc. and it was her beloved pet. I would definitely want my partner to ask (though I can see why you didn\u2019t after her initial response). \n\nYour friend didn\u2019t know your gf wasn\u2019t okay with it and aware, so he\u2019s def not an AH. \n\nThe TL;DR here is that I think at worst you\u2019re oblivious and lightly inconsiderate and were in an awkward enough position for that to not push you into AH territory. I can see why it wouldn\u2019t be obvious why this is unacceptable. Hell I know people who wouldn\u2019t find this unacceptable. At the same time, your gf is going through a difficult enough time that she shouldn\u2019t be blindsided. Sometimes there are no AHs, just an unfortunate combination of circumstances, emotions, and different approaches.", "YTA, and if you\u2019re honest with yourself, you know it - there\u2019s a reason you told your girlfriend your friend \u2018disposed of it\u2019 without telling her exactly how.", "Nta, she said you could do anything with it", "I would not be surprised if you had killed the cat.

But ultimately, what's done is done. I personally don't think you're a****** but I think you still should have checked with her the ask specifically about this. As long as she doesn't have to see the cat at your friend's house, then hopefully, this blows over.", "NTA. So what if it\u2019s unusual. Your gf didn\u2019t seem to care what you did with the body.

Her saying \u201cdo whatever\u201d is because she was too upset to talk about it clearly. Like, are you a chunk of fudge? Very clearly those were the options she was asking you to choose between. Any normal, sane, decent human being would be able to understand that. Taxidermy is weird to the majority of the population because it\u2019s weird.

We joke about not buying too much of her expensive food at once because she might not live to finish the bag. It\u2019s the dark humor. But, we took her to the vet because she was stumbling when she walked (looked drunk) and I couldn\u2019t stop crying. She was fine, and was diagnosed with arthritis, but even knowing that (we were picking her up and getting medications. Again, I knew it wasn\u2019t life threatening) I couldn\u2019t help but cry. If, in that moment, you asked me what to do if she suddenly died, I\u2019d be able to choke out a \u201cwhatever\u201d and be done. Now if you asked me (it\u2019s been a few days), I\u2019d say I want her cremated. \n\nHer emotions were running sky high and you knew *exactly* what she meant when she said \u201cdo whatever\u201d and you went above and beyond and goofed up. Pretty typical weaponized incompetence if you ask me. Now, you\u2019re in the comments playing dumb because everyone\u2019s saying YTA and you still think you\u2019re not and everyone else is wrong. We\u2019re not; you are.", "Are really this dense?", "Well, you might have to start making an effort to view things from other's perspectives. You know when people do something that bothers you, and you think to yourself \"I wish they wouldn't do that, it's so inconsiderate! Why don't they just think about the people around them?\", Yeah, other people also feel that, and you're that person.", "[removed]", "Ok but it\u2019s still out of the ordinary. and really, you should\u2019ve known this could be upsetting to your gf (or anyone)", "I mean I don't think that's necessarily fair to him, though, but it's up to you. Would your girlfriend ever see the cat at your friend's house.", "It's not insane. Taxidermy is a legitimate thing. Many people taxidermy their pets after those die.", "He didnt taxidermy it tho... his friend did.", "She doesn't have to see it. Some ppl would argue that the taxidermy is more respectful than burning or burying or throwing it away in a dumpster... the literal fact is that she said she didn't care. She could have told him just as easily that she wished the body to be cremated or buried, but she didn't. She knew the friend took it and never inquired further.", "I don't think this friend of his is all that important either as   they are also upset with the lack of permission and OP is still doubling down.", "I did not, my friend did.", "Exactly. It's not two thing you'd generally put together. \n\nBut someone, somewhere will always think of it.", "I had asked that but her response was not either of those, it was just that I should deal with it as it was too much for her to process at the moment and she said anything is fine, just do not toss him in the dumpster.", "It is possible. But now even my friend is a little upset since he thought my girlfriend knew and he feels bad for having it.", "It\u2019s not any better? He still SOLD the cat so the taxidermy could happen. Actually kinda worse because he profited off of his gfs dead cat.", "Some people could argue that\u2026but not her. And she had no reason to believe that he would do anything like this.", "Its not respectful to most people. To most its desecration. It\u2019s different if its your own pet or an animal with no humans attached to it. And she literally told him to not throw it in a dumpster. She just didn\u2019t care if he buried it or burned it or gave it to someone to take care of like the police station.", "Yeah, which he won't do if you didn't give it to him and gave permission to do. Why not just bury it? Heck, even your friend is upset with you.", "She clarified to not desecrate the cats body. What do you think taxidermy is to most people?", "Did you tell her you were going to taxidermy her cat? Or did you let her think you\u2019d bury or cremate it? She did clarify not to just put him in the dumpster as that would desecrate the body, and you did a thing that people would think desecrated the body.", "You need to get that cat back from him, and properly dispose of it. Then you need to pay your friend back.", "Well yeah he\u2019s now put in the middle of an argument that you caused because you lied and said you \u201cdisposed\u201d of it when you actually knew exactly what it was being used for.", "Well ultimately you have to do what you think is best for you and your girlfriend. But just don't take the judgment of this board too seriously. You'll find out that there's some ruthless and cruel cats on this board that will slaughter you for what you did.", "Did you read the story at all? His friend asked for the cat, and he agreed to let the friend take the corpse. The friend PAID to have it taxidermied. He was not paid for the corpse. He disposed of it by letting his friend HAVE it after his gf said he had full discretion to deal with it.", "Agree to disagree... i think it was disrespectful that she didn't care what happened to her pet aside from \"dont throw it in the dumpster,\" which is the bottom of the barrel respect wise. She didn't even follow up with OPs friend to find out what happened to her cat. He could have thrown it in a dumpster for all she knew. I think it's a little too late to start caring for my taste.", "Honest question, if she didn\u2019t want it buried, cremated, or thrown away what should he have done?", "I did misread that part. However my other point still stands, no sane person thinks that their partner is going to let someone else taxidermy their cat.", "That\u2019s not disposing of it. That\u2019s reusing it.", "Why would she follow up with the friend?? She didn\u2019t know bf gave it to his friend in the first place.", "She didn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t want it cremated or buried. She just said she didn\u2019t care either way. Whatever would be easier for him i assume", "As someone else mentioned, she didn\u2019t say burial and cremation were off the table, just not to toss in the trash. \n\nTo most people, those are the only 3 options. When she said \u201cwhatever is easier\u201d, she was saying \u201cout of the remaining 2 options of cremation or burial, pick whichever one you think is easier and do that one. I don\u2019t have the mental space to pick because I\u2019m stressed and grieving\u201d. That is how 99% of the population would\u2019ve handled this. \n\nShe said don\u2019t throw him away because she didn\u2019t want him desecrated. OP is just a bar of fudge. Even though she said \u201cwhatever\u201d, everyone else knows there\u2019s only 2 reasonable choices. If you do taxidermy you know to ask other people if that\u2019s an option because, even if you\u2019re into you, you know most people are not. It\u2019s literally as simple as that.", "I beg to differ... she knew that the friend got the cat. Have you ever met anyone who likes taxidermy? They are not shy about it...if she had wishes about the disposable of the cat, she should have stated those wishes at the appropriate time. She did not. She wanted him to deal with it, and he did. His only fault in this is the omissions of what the friend did with the corpse, but as he stated, she didn't want any part of the disposable and had no care of what happened to the remains. It is unfair for her to puit the weight of the disposable on him and then criticize him after the fact because it goes against her wish, which she never stated.", "Lol none of that means anything. I can\u2019t keep repeating the same point over and over again.", "All you are illustrating here is your inability to understand the actual problem", "Nor can i..", "Lol. And you are illustrating that you can not tolerate any opinion but your own. I def understand the \"problem\" that you think is the issue, but i disagree.\nBut again, you are unwilling to accept differing perspectives.", "And you are unwilling to accept the girlfriend\u2019s perspective. Which is what makes you incapable of understanding the actual problem or helping OP.", "YTA, man, I hope she leaves you.\n\nIf anyone did that to my cat I'd beat the ever living shit out them and make sure to never interact with that person again.\n\nHow could someone your age think that that's okay? You seem dense AF!", "YTA don\u2019t be so dense. You knew what she meant. She wanted you to bury him or cremate him for her. You gave it to a friend who ASKED FOR SOMEONE ELSES DEAD CAT? That\u2019s a red flag on his part and on yours for giving the cat to him! ESPECIALLY since it seems you knew what he wanted to do with him. That is so wildly inappropriate I cannot believe you even need to ask if you\u2019re TA.", "NTA.", "Idk why everyone is saying y.t.a. but i think NTA.\n\nYes u may have been a bit ignorant in the sense that you didnt think about it too much.

You\u2019ll have to pay your friend back for the taxidermy and maybe get the body cremated if still possible.", "YTA, she never would have imagined that this is what you'd do with her cats body. A quick message to her would have stopped this from happening. \n\nSurely you can see why this is wrong?", "Of course YTA. Why do you even have to ask?", "YTA not for the taxidermy part inherently but for not telling her about it. There was no need for you to keep it from her unless you thought it might upset her.

There is no way the cat recently passed and your friend got the body back already. High quality taxidermists have wait lists of at least 9+ months, and freeze drying takes even longer.

He has no excuse or person to hide behind.", "No, you didn't dispose it, this is purely semantics. You knew about the taxidermy, don't wash your hands in innocence.

It's also obvious that her \"not wanting to see the body and having it disposed\" meant some sort of burial or disposal.

At no point did she consent to you allowing your friend to turn *her* cat into a display piece for his home. At no point did you tell her this was happening so she could say yes or no, which makes it worse imo. Apologize to both of them for your dishonesty.

Friend either fcks cats or is a serial killer. There is no grey area here.", "I hope to god OP dumps him. He has no regard for her feelings, and I can\u2019t believe he has to be told he\u2019s an AH on Reddit to understand how terrible this thing he did is. This is one of those situations where if you need the internet to tell you, then you are truly awful and your partner deserves to gtfo", "Don't use autistic as an insult please.", "I would maybe be ok with my pet being taxidermied, but ABSOLUTELY NOT without my knowledge/permission. I think OP knew he was an AH on some level, otherwise he would've told his gf before the sister did.", "It is so weird to me that someone can both claim to have no attachment to the dead body but at the same time have stipulations on what should be done with the body.\n\nIt is PERFECTLY FINE TO CARE and say you care. \n\nFor the record to many people taxidermy is the deepest form of tribute you could show to anyone, just ask the Egyptians with all of their taxidermied humans/mummies.\n\nI'm claiming NAH because the girlfriend DID CARE, despite telling OP differently. \n\n*OP had incorrect information to work from,* *thus it was an honest mistake.*", "Your feelings about taxidermy pets don\u2019t matter though. Not everyone is dramatically sickened by it. I\u2019m keeping my cats\u2019 bones and pelts after they pass.", "Yeah cos semantics are going to make you not the Ah here. YTA", "there\u2019s no shovel emoji but keep digging", "Nta would she be mad if you cremated it and gave your friend the ashes since technically it is still the body of her cat? A lot of care goes into prepping an animal for taxidermy. It\u2019s not just take sone three day old cat to some hack in a van to stuff the cat. If she doesn\u2019t believe in the afterlife then the \u201cshell\u201d of her cat being at your friends house shouldn\u2019t bother her. I mean prob put it away before she comes over so she doesn\u2019t have to look at it but other than that out of sight out of mind. She gave up custody.", "Did you come here for advice or vindication? Bottom line, you should have been explicit with your girlfriend. Listen to what literally everyone is telling you.", "Then why did you lie to her about what happened to the cat?", "So you admit you ignored her wishes.", "At this point, he\u2019s going into negative double digits.", "Lol, yes, I was thinking the same.\n\nA or B\n\nWhichever\n\nDoes a wild and incomprehensible C\n\nAre you nuts?\n\nBut you said whichever!! \ud83e\udd7a", "The more I think about this one the more I get nauseous.", "Most people probably aren't insane enough to think someone would do this to their pet in a culture that doesn't ever do this really. The correct information unless highly disconnected from the rest of your society would be knowing what is reasonable and what needs asking for specifically. \n\nLike at zero point when my mum died was I concerned my step fathers burial plans for my mother would be to mummify her and keep her in the lounge inside a sarcophagus. I shouldn't have to consider such things. \n\nIts like if someone is a photographer and wants you to model for some shots. If they asked if you mind them being used for a work project you'd probably say that's fine. But if that project turned out to be making you the face of chlamydia sufferers, you might suddenly take issue as it isn't reasonable to assume you'll be made a public face of stds withour being asked. \n\nPeople rarely talk in absolutes and you have to consider their feelings. Like someone might not care what a reasonable person does with a pet but if they find you in the garden making a ritualistic satanic totem out of Mr Tibbles leftovers, \"but you said you didn't care\" isn't really guna get you out of it.", "The gf probably had no idea that that was even a possibility. When she said she didn\u2019t care, she was almost definitely thinking of burial or cremation. The bf should have at least mentioned taxidermy", "The gf was away from home surrounded by grieving family and dealing with the passing of her grandmother. She won't have had the capacity to process losing her cat so unexpectedly at that time. She trusted OP to respectfully put her cat to rest in a fitting manner and he did this shit. I am very literal when it comes to instructions and even I know what she meant.\n\nOP: YTA", "I\u2019m seeing all points being made, but this one resonates.", "I can see the Egyptian connection(I never thought of embalming as a type of taxidermy) but the Egyptians didn't put the mummies in their living room for all to see. They put them in crypts/pits and far away from other people. They also knew who would be handling the body of their loved one and signed off on it happening.\n\nThis is way different than OP giving his GF's dead cat to a friend so it can be taxidermed.  The Egyptians also buried the end result with the pharaoh(or family member). It sounds like any product of taxidermy was still in the hands of the original owner, not a random friend.", "No. He lied to his GF. He knew how she would react. Now he\u2019s lying to us hoping we\u2019ll have his back.", "Your friend was under the impression that you've asked her and she was okay with it according to you.", "You knew what he was gonna do with it and you STILL GAVE IT TO HIM. You are to blame here. He wouldn\u2019t have did it if YOU DIDN\u2019T GIVE IT TO HIM!", "Feeling bad about this is a normal human response. I honestly can't understand why you don't, or why you did this in the first place. It's an awful thing to do to someone you supposedly love, and even worse to double down when they tell you they're hurt by it.", "You\u2019re a real piece of work. YTA no matter which way you try to slice it.", "Normally they cremate it and you get a little urn of their ashes if they are legit.  Some backyard taxidermy people don\u2019t obviously but OP should look into this"]}
