By that I mean \"her point was that you're not of an ethnicity that's allowed to wear this style\". Her intent was to police appropriation, but her effect was to police your identity. You don't look like most people for whom this style is part of their culture. But like an adopted child, that doesn't make you less entitled to it. By policing it, saying \"I know on sight who is and isn't black\", she was effectively enforcing racist assumptions. She also did the classic racist move of mistaking racial / cultural identity (in these case, failing to distinguish between different types of braids). \n\nWhile.the random white woman may not have had racism in her heart, may have been trying to fight against it, the effect of her actions was to police your ethnicity, and to do so in inaccurate ways in many dimensions.
