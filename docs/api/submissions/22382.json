She doesn\u2019t care, she thinks she is right, she doesn\u2019t *believe* you, anyway, and she thinks she should educate *you* in how wrong you are.

Most people say if someone of that ethnicity offered to make your hair in a traditional way, it's kind of like an approval. And not only skin color matters in this case, you connect with your family, even if you don't share the same ancestors.\nMy guess is that since the lady mistook your hair for box braids, she felt embarassed and chose to not back down after you educated her, bc she is an AH.", "I don't know if the random white lady was jealous of your hair. She may have been jealous of your ability to wear your hair that way without risking the charge of cultural appropriation, where she could not. She may also have legitimately felt that by policing cultural appropriation, she was doing her part to right the wrongs of a legacy of racism she benefits from. It's hard to know, and it doesn't matter. \n\nI've seen this sometimes - people earnestly attempting to be respectful of other cultures without being exotifying or appropriative, but crossing the line into gatekeeping based on their fundamentally racist assumptions. By that I mean \"her point was that you're not of an ethnicity that's allowed to wear this style\". Her intent was to police appropriation, but her effect was to police your identity. You don't look like most people for whom this style is part of their culture. But like an adopted child, that doesn't make you less entitled to it. By policing it, saying \"I know on sight who is and isn't black\", she was effectively enforcing racist assumptions. She also did the classic racist move of mistaking racial / cultural identity (in these case, failing to distinguish between different types of braids). \n\nWhile.the random white woman may not have had racism in her heart, may have been trying to fight against it, the effect of her actions was to police your ethnicity, and to do so in inaccurate ways in many dimensions. Her audicity allowed her to do so, and makes her an AH. \n\nNTA.", "I am French. Half of the little French girls right now in the street have braids that look exactly like what you called Mexican braids, I just googled it.\n\nNext awful white lady, just tell her those are French braids, that you have French ancestors, and she just insulted your culture HOW DARE SHE.

They're just like the same braids white people do with ribbons.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYou don't need anyone telling you what is \"cultural appropriation\" especially from entitled people who are upset for no reason and don't understand that Mexican braids exist.", "This is definitely a situation of cultural appreciation and NOT appropriation.
