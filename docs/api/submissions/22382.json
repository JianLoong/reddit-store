You don't look like most people for whom this style is part of their culture. But like an adopted child, that doesn't make you less entitled to it.

We paid for a reserved picnic area in one of our local parks. Early in the morning on the day of I went to the park with the papers from the city that I was to tape to the tables to let people know the space was reserved per the instructions. Later when I returned the markers were in the trash and a family of Mexican descent and this white girl were all over the reserved area.\n\nThe white girl went crazy when I asked them to respect the reserved space and unloaded on me for appropriating Mexican culture by having a pi\u00f1ata. I was not in the mood to deal with her so I just kept doing my thing. My mother (born in Peru American citizen) and foster SIL (born in Mexico American citizen) took it up from there and unloaded on the chick in their very native Spanish. I end up breaking things up and tell the chick to call the police if she wants to continue, she keeps talking S at a distance, passive aggressive BS, whatever.\n\nLater on when I was cleaning up after the party and the soccer matches the family was there for wind down a trio of Mexican men led by an older man (familia abuelo) come over an begin apologizing profusely. It turns out crazy is one of the grand children's girl friends and has taken on some toxic faux Latina persona and as far as they are concerned a lot of face has been lost. I accepted the apology in my broken Spanish, assured them our family had a crazy one too and they are not at fault but that I appreciated them coming over. We shared a beer and I sent them on their way with a pile of burgers and more beer.\n\nAs I left the park with the last wagon load I could hear Se\u00f1or abuelo tearing her a new ass over the whole thing, especially the cultural appropriation jibe.
