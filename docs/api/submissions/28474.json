Some people have healthy parents who understand their adults kids are adults and don\u2019t interrogate them or blackmail them with threatening to remove from the will. This is borderline abusive imo", "No you're not the asshole, but your sister certainly is and so are your parents. My grandparents are some of the most Bible thumping-est Christians you'll meet, but whenever I did something stupid they just got disappointed and said \"God's watching you\" not fucking disown me. That's what my non-religious parents did, so religion as their excuse is fucking stupid", "Yep. I wouldn't rat my sister out for any amount of money, and your entire family dynamic is crazy controlling...you will get disowned for having fun? I'd pack n move and go make my own way.", "Weird parenting here. I feel bad for you AND your sister. She\u2019s 20!  She\u2019s either going to sow some oats Now or it\u2019ll come out later after she has a family. I have seen it destroy marriages. I had some judgement while raising my daughter but I gave her enough freedom to have fun But stay SAFE. I\u2019m extremely concerned for both you and your sister. NTA.", "You did her a favor, your parents sound shitty to have conditional will interest based on your behavior at this age. Good riddance being disowned and no one needs their parents money when they die anyway.", "NTA\n\nI think this situation is a very difficult one being that you rely on them financially but you're also a legal adult. As a 20yr old who is working and going to college, I understand the struggle of trying to be independent from your family. It doesn't help the fact that your parents seem to think that because they support you financially, they can control you and your sister. (I have religious controlling family members who I cut out of my life so I understand the struggle). I don't necessarily blame you for telling your parents about her lie. You aren't responsible for your sisters actions but being that you are both dealing with having controlling parents, it's better if you try to stick together in the long run. Having a talk with your parents could be helpful but if you're in a situation where that won't work, it's best to keep out of trouble with them and work towards moving out. It'll be difficult but it'll be worth it when you are financially independent.", "ESH. Your parents for obsessively controlling their adult children. Your sister for putting you in that situation. You for agreeing to something and then telling your parents about it. \n\nYou need to fix your issues with your sister because I guarantee that your parents will always be like this, even when you don't live there anymore, and if you've burned all the bridges with your sister before there's a big family blowout, you'll have no one.", "What in the toxic hell is this. They are trying to control their ADULT children by threatening to cut them out of the will. You are not the asshole or your sister she is 20! Your parents are the assholes. Being religious does not give you a hall pass to control people with money. Neither does it make it okay to treat your children as property you can control. I do hope you get out of this environment when you get older. I'd definitely make an exit strategy. And your sister is living the same insane thing your are. Probably even worse since she is a girl and well girls are usally treated worse then the male heirs in really religious households.  Your were pressured in to telling the truth, to securing your future with college and were put in that spot by your sister. So this was of her own making.", "She\u2019s an adult she shouldn\u2019t have to lie I\u2019d be finding my own place to live. Are they paying for her college?", "Your parents are TA", "ESH\n\nYour parents are garbage and I have yet to see where you disagree with them.\n\n>but I told her there was no choice.\n\nThere is ALWAYS a choice. Might not be an easy one and make your life harder, but it's still there.", "Honestly, you and your sister need to seek mental assistance after leaving your parents home and going no contact with them for life. They are abusing you two and i see your sisters actions as her only means at control over her own life. Many who are abused act out and will often find someone else to slightly abuse or fully abuse themselves as they feel they cant turn it around on their abusers themselves (thats your guys situation as siblings). Your parents are the only AH here and id suggest finishing college soon and leaving immediately and sit down with your sister and have the same convo with her about leaving. Let your parents be alone and cry about it until they die. Your mental health and your sisters is far important than whatever your parents MAY give you. I can tell you, it doesnt matter what you do and how obedient you are, itll never be enough for them and theyll find a reason to not give you a dime. Paying for college is them being controlling, unfortunately. Get out asap and never look back. Tell your sis to do the same because this will only get worse from here. \n\nNTA.", "What kind of parents have to parent their kids by holding inheritance over their kids heads? \n\nI don\u2019t know who the AH is here, but I\u2019m not a fan of this parenting style.", "You and your sister may want to work through your issues as you", ">their adult daughters\n\nOP is male", "OP said their parents are extremely religious", "Oh I think they\u2019re all AHs. OP and sister are AHs because parents are AHs but they\u2019re still AHs the same. \n\nSister pressured OP. OP is acting like they didn\u2019t agree to this of their own free Will.", "It\u2019s super messed up but your parents income counts as yours when it comes to financial aid for college until you are 25/26. I couldn\u2019t go to the school I wanted to because my parents income made it so that I got very little financial aid, even though I moved out at 16 and wasn\u2019t speaking to them, and they definitely weren\u2019t giving me any money. It\u2019s pretty messed up and allows parents to control adult children", "Right, this screams narcissistic behavior imo (not a diagnosis, but it is a red flag)", "Don\u2019t feel sorry for the sister as she seems to have her own manipulation with OP.

My parents kicked me out at 18 but luckily for me my grandfather was a lawyer and helped me get legal emancipation. You wouldn't think that was necessary if you're already a legal adult, but it really helps with financial matters because you have a legal document to show that you are not dependent on your parents' income. It made me eligible for financial aid I couldn't have gotten otherwise. \n\nFor anyone under 26 in the USA who is kicked out or cut off or needs to leave/cut off your parents for any reason, PLEASE look into legal emancipation as an option if you can. It could open up a lot of avenues for you. Local libraries often offer free legal advice workshops on certain days.", "I left home mid- final year of high school because my biodad was a jerk. Started college a couple years later and signed a form declaring that I was not a dependant and got no financial support from my family, and that opened me up for in-state tuition and financial aid.
