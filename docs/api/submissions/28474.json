While that did help my relationship with my parents, Fox News came along and destroyed it. It taught them to hate me. They always acted like they were so much better than me.

So if it\u2019s changed, I will fight it. They got mad and changed the poa to my mom\u2019s brother in law. He stole my land and prevented me from selling it because he was the poa. When he sold MY land, my parents attorney notarized it. So she\u2019s in on it. No Lawer wants to help me for less than $5,000. He\u2019s been sending me their money. I found out he\u2019s had 9 foreclosures, he\u2019s renting out part of his house and of course stole from me. So I will never get the money back, he\u2019s obviously desperate for money. I ran into them at the nursing home and immediately confronted them. He lied and said it was not him, but he never asked to see the proof I have. Because he knows he did it.

But the state of Florida gave $600,000 to the millionaire property I managed to dredge their sand. You will never hear either thing on main stream media or really any media. I just know because I\u2019m a property manager. I have very little but if I see a homeless person I give them something. Once it was only an orange but they guy appreciated it. I\u2019m sure he was thirsty and hungry. Someone on Reddit made a huge deal because a homeless person refused a bag of chips. I\u2019m sure it never occurred to her that he might be thirsty.

In which you've sacrificed something most valuable that whatever gained in inheritance is meaningless.\n\nYour parents are toxic in your post and I would guess they are manipulative, controlling, punishing, shaming, emotionally abusive and toxic in many other ways.\n\nIf they are serious and not speaking in hyperbole, like saying you're grounded for life and I'm sending you to boot camp, as an exaggerated overly reaction, then ooofs\n\nThey are so toxic that I thought this post had to be fake.\n\nI'd put my head down, focus on my studies, a paying job, saving money and moving out, even moving out with my sister so we could both be in a healthy environment with freedom to grow up.\n\nJust checked ages, I'd be working full time, out of the house and saving fast.\nI thought you both were in high school with the lack of autonomy you have.\n\nCan't give judgment here.\n\nYou either live under your parents threats or you don't. Those threats mean in decades you don't get money that may no longer exist or that the parents that love to control you, kick you out.\n\nLikely these tactics always worked on you and are possibly empty threats to control and scare you because they know they have no real power over you.\n\nThey really have no power over you unless they are going to lock you up and be physically abusive.\n\nJust incase, I'd be prepared to be on my own financially, looking for roomates and then I'd start being independent and stop allowing them to control me.\n\nI'd not have allowed my parents to threaten me into telling my sisters secret at that age. 12 yes, 20/21, No! I'd have told them this behavior is not okay and they are abusing their power as parents.

You actually have the power here, you can live your life and advocate for a healthy relationship with them or leave until they can be respectful. \n\nThat doesn't make you an AH, but should open your eyes to the choice you have made to live as they say. If anything, makes you an AH to yourself.\n\nAlso adding, you should have a heart to heart with your sister. Apologize and explain the fear you felt, explain why you did what you did.\n\nTry to patch this up and create a plan for the future. Be honest, if you know you will crumble with pressure and fear under your parents threats but want to support your sister, let her know you need her to keep details from you and not ask for rides to specific places.\n\nI reccomend highly that you both go get counseling and create a healthy plan on how to navigate your parents, set yourselves free so next time this tactic doesn't work on you.\n\nBeing raised in a home like this will have created problems, thinking and habits that will get in the way of living healthy, being in healthy relationships and being healthy parents.\nYou do not want to go on to model this behavior or put your future children through this from you or their grandparents.\n\nYou and your sister are going to need each other, siblings always do, but even more so with parents and situations like this.\nYou two should stick together, stay open and have eachothers backs.\n\nYou need to be thinking on if this is the way you want to be treated and what type of boundaries you want to put up for people to have the privilege of being in your life.\n\nYou should not tolerate this, you deserve better. But you'll come to learn if you tolerate this, you will be making your future partners and children also have to suffer this abuse.\n\nHow much abuse are you willing to take or willing to see people you love take?\n\nCounseling ASAP\nPay for your own college and set yourself free.\n\nOr live 100% as they say, find a partner who has the same strict religious beliefs and raise your kids this same way. Allow them to tell your kids if they dont obey, they will be disowned.\nFollow everything they demand you do and give away private info on everyone you know to appease them. Give up your self respect, integrity, individuality and dreams.\n\nIf they want to be apart of your life, they will start respecting your boundaries and autonomy after you start voicing and standing by your boundaries.\n\nIf they place religious views over being in your life and respecting you, then that's something helpful to you.
