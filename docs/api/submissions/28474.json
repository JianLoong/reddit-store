Seriously, what kind of parent holds their children's education hostage to some puritanic standards of behavior?

As long as there are no serious consequences (e.g. not driving drunk or getting into other dangerous situations), it's all part of normal life.\n\nYou should realize what your parents are doing. It's the good old \"divide and conquer\" strategy. And it's working, because you're so afraid of them, and so eager to be the golden child, that you're willing to throw your sister under the bus. \n\nIf you two stick together, your parents won't be able to threaten you so easily and pit you against each other anymore. Either you both win, or you'll be forever stuck being terrified of your parents. Seems like your sister understands this, so if you don't stand with her, she'll go off and be independent after they cut her off, while you'll be left under your parents' thumb for a long, long time.\n\nYour sister shouldn't have called you a loser.

I'd at least apologise, but point out that you're as much a prisoner to their whims as she is at the moment. I can understand your reasoning, but ultimately it's a bit like snitching in prison.
