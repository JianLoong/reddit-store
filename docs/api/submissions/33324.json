Putting down his wife and hitting on you in one fell swoop. Dude is a dud.", "NTA - but you're probably going to want to talk to your friend and maybe apologize to her (not her husband) for letting yourself get heated.\n\nThe thing is, either your friend doesn't share your thoughts on her husband's attitude, in which case she may feel hurt and upset that you made him feel like she does, or (worse imo) she DOES share your thoughts and may have just found herself being suddenly put on the spot to reassure him that she doesn't no matter the impact that lie may have on her own well being. In either case, you've put her in a bit of a tough spot by lashing out \"on her behalf\" but not with her in mind. Maybe when you talk with her, it would be worth it to take a minute and acknowledge that you have seen her doing her absolute best to navigate everything in her life lately and found yourself offended on her behalf that he would insult her to your face while not being willing to help her shoulder the weight of their shared life together. Remind her you love her and that you understand sometimes even when you love someone and feel called to defend them, it is better to allow them to take the lead in how that defense is shaped,and you're sorry that you reacted to his words off hand rather than taking the time to see how she would prefer it be handled. Maybe by validating that it can feel crummy to have others \"take over\" for us in ways that end up accidentally adding to our workload rather than reducing it, she'll hear the important part - you love her and worry that she isn't getting enough support and care of her own. In hearing that, maybe the conversation of what kind of care and support would really help her can unfold going forward.", "Nope, sorry, he insulted your friend to your face. What did he expect? For you to giggle, blush, and thank him for the \"compliment.\" F guys like Bob. Everything you said was harsh but true and he needed to hear it. NTA\n\nThis may impact your friendship with Lisa though. People don't like a mirror held up to their relationships. I would apologize to *her* for snapping instead of giving a more measured response, but Bob deserves nothing. I'd also gently stand by your sentiment. Offer her help and a place to say if she ever gets tired of being the only parent in her marriage.", "NTA. You've probably created distance between you and Lisa, don't get me wrong, but you just said what should have been said.", "SHOULD you have said it the way you did? Maybe not. \n\nBut were most of us cheering you on as we read this? HECK YEAH!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udf7e\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Even if your friend now says you shouldn't have, you still did right, you defended her, he shouldn't have trash talkd her. What sis he expect? Complacency? Hell, he can be mad at you, he should be ashamed of himself. But on top of all of that, giving your friend a hard time??? \nSounds like she would be so much better off being a single parent...", "NTA, but what you were trying to say may have been better received if you hadn't gotten so heated.

The issue is that this will only cause further issues for your friend while there already seems to be a lot on her plate and Bob might try to alienate her from you.
