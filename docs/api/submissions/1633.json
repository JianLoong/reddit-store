Without going into too much detail, he stepped up for a kid he fathered after the mother wanted to give him up for adoption which means he\u2019s now a single father.\u00a0\n\nThis man grew up wealthy just like my husband and has the support of his parents. But because of this very huge life transition, he\u2019s had to take some time off of work. My husband has taken this to mean,\u00a0\u2018I need to buy this man and his child every cute outfit I see, as well as ask him if he\u2019s heard about this top of the line car seat. Oh, he hasn\u2019t? Let me buy it for him so he can try it out.\u201d\n\nNow, I get it. Like I said, my husband is very generous and when he cares for people, he just wants to make sure they\u2019re okay. But these are no longer just his finances. Some of what he was buying came out of our shared account.\u00a0\n\nRecently, he has been suggesting we childproof parts of our home and even put a crib in our guest room in case the friend and his son want to stay over sometime or if he needs someone to babysit. I told him this is too far and that he\u2019s overthinking things.\n\nLast night, I overheard my husband in tears on the phone with his friend, explaining that he wants to be more involved but it\u2019s just not possible right now.

Are there more practical ways that he can help people, rather than financially?  Would volunteering bring him more satisfaction?  How can he channel his generosity in other ways, too, that he'd find fulfilling?\n\nAnd if he's not in a place to understand why he was crying about this, perhaps counseling would help bring him more clarity.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of reasons I can think about, but the only ones that count are the ones that he knows apply to himself.", "Your husband sounds very thoughtful and very generous. But generosity is a problem when you light yourself on fire to keep others warm. Has your husband ever heard of this concept? \n\nIt\u2019s also a problem when your generosity is so large you are willing to sacrifice what is not yours to share.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, while it sounds like your husband was raised to be thoughtful and generous, somewhere along the line for him, the shirt off his back stopped being enough. He\u2019s stripping himself naked and then deciding that other peoples clothes are better served to those in \u201cneed.\u201d And that\u2019s not his place to make that decision for them, and it\u2019s definitely not healthy for him to have absolutely zero boundaries with his generosity.\n\nI would firmly (but kindly) suggest that you express to him you feel like this has become a problem and that you would like to go to therapy. Both together and him individually. \n\nAs I\u2019ve said, this just doesn\u2019t sound healthy anymore. At the very least, your ideals don\u2019t match.

Something isn\u2019t right here for him, and I don\u2019t know what it is. It sounds like neither do you, and neither does he.

If your husbands friend is a good friend, I can\u2019t possibly imagine he feels your husband needs to have a crib for his child in your house. So either your husband is putting those expectations on himself, or his friend is and he is not aware of how to draw proper boundaries with people, or able to see when someone is taking advantage of him.
