Now we come from a very liberal background from new york.

This includes them taking after Catherine in her ideas on the economy, healthcare, taxes, etc. I truly think they're too young for this propaganda and I can't believe Nora allows it.\n\nSo I told Nora all about this and said that her kids were already acting like their other mom, and that they're too young to be exposed to these kinds of things. She told me my concerns were baseless and that as their mothers, it was their job to worry about this. \n\nI told her she didn't worry about this and that's what caught me off guard. Nora got really mad and told me to keep my judgemental comments to myself and not forget that Catherine is also their mother. I just raised one concern. AITA?\n\nEdit: for the context, This whole conversation and my questions about these from grandkids started from a game on monopoly we were playing with them alone while their moms were at work.\nThey knew about the difference of opinion regarding taxes between the two parties, about different ways of investment, about what assets are and about funds. To be fair my grandson knew more than my granddaughter but she'll also get there. They share all of their views with Catherine about these things.

The worst people are those who continue to push their will onto others and I see it all the time where I live (southwest United States where Mormonism is EXTREMELY prominent).

Good for her for rising above the prejudices you tried to instill in her and being open to viewpoints other than her own.", "YTA, though I don\u2019t think this is fake. I was one of those kids that started talking about all this politics stuff really early too. \n\nFirst, parents have a right to teach their kids whatever they want. \n\nTwo, when you say the kids are \u201ctoo young to be exposed to\u201d the \u201cpropaganda\u201d, what you really mean is that you don\u2019t want them to be incorruptible. As in, they\u2019re too young to learn conservative values, but not too young to learn yours.

Conservative brainwashing is very blunt and in your face, which is why people have such extreme reactions from it and it is easier to part from from a rhetoric perspective. Liberal brainwashing though, and this is from firsthand experience, as a kid you won\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening until you grow up, and it has taken me years to undo the damage caused by it and I still don\u2019t know that I have, nor do I have any confidence that I will ever do so.\n\nThus, if you insist on this path, tread carefully\u2026", "Yes, Grandma you are the AH.

Nonetheless children that young shouldn't hold strong political values because I believe it can be really damaging to them as they get older (e.i. if the grandson wants to try wearing a dress and remembers how thats viewed by the conservative side of his family).

She complained about how much taxes took from her check and how her parents were right about taxes. Weren\u2019t we mad about it?! Tbf she was 16 and all of us were 20s-60s so we were really gentle, but firm in our no. Yeah about not getting to pick where our tax money went, but we talked about road infrastructure, family on social security and disability, all of the things. She was like \ud83d\ude2e. The all walks of life and ages of the break room helped her see things a bit differently. Yeah liberal environment, but she was given a broad perspective so couldn\u2019t just be like democrats! Idk if she ever said anything to her parents, but she worked there until she went to college and I feel like she benefited from knowing us.

OP, as far as I know, has made no other reference to discussing abortion with her grandkids.", "When I was that age, I probably would have been pro-life.

That's probably the least suspect of the positions the kids hold.", "Can we stop pretending that \"if people are unable to afford healthcare then they shouldn't get it and suffer/die\" and \"if people are unable to afford healthcare then we should help them out\" are equivalent views. I could say the same things about many of the current issues especially those centered around race, gender, LGBT etc. \n\nStop with this \"both sides\" bullshit. Like one of these sides would probably stop OPs daughter from adopting if they could. \n\nTeaching kids that they should care about and respect their fellow human being is not propaganda.", "Lmao I've been teaching my kid for the past 13 years to not fall into the Republican trap. If he grows up to be a White Christian Nationalist fuckwit at least I know I did my best to help him not be a Republican.", "i bet i know the answer to this. it kinda sounds like OP is offended that her daughter married a republican and this is her chance to make a point.", "Absolutely!", "YESS, say it louder for the OP!!!", "I think it is important to note that the discussion about taxes and investment and assets and funds, and being able to afford things (including healthcare*) happened while OP and the kids were playing Monopoly.\n\nA game expressly about *investing, and assets, and pulling \"you contribute the the community fund\" and \"you have a hospital bill, pay $50 or go to jail\" cards, and taxes, and property ownership* - to be able to play the game, you need to have some idea of how those things work. And to *win* the game, you have to be a bit of an asshole who makes unethical choices (based on childhood memories rofl).\n\nSo if the grandkids play Monopoly on the regular, it would make sense that they know how to play the game, and what those things are in broad strokes. And it isn't entirely impossible that their parents had a \"some people think this, some people think that\" discussion during a game. \n\nIt even makes sense that the kids - within the context of the game - think that if you can't pay for healthcare, that means you don't get to go to the doctor. *Because if you can't pay your bill in the game, you go to jail and don't go to the doctor.* \n\n* I'm referencing healthcare, although OP's post originally said abortion, because I'm not sure I believe that they discussed abortion with their grandkids. I've seen nothing in the comments that expands on that, although something could have been deleted. I think, like this whole post, OP is aiming for \"shock\" value, when really, this is just about a bloody game of Monopoly and OP is trying to leverage that into \"proof\" that her DIL is bad. Which might explain why they don't see the grandkids that much.", "Yeah, at 6 I parroted a decent number of conservative talking points just because that\u2019s what I overheard from adults.
