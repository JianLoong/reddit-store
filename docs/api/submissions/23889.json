Now we come from a very liberal background from new york.

This includes them taking after Catherine in her ideas on the economy, healthcare, taxes, etc. I truly think they're too young for this propaganda and I can't believe Nora allows it.\n\nSo I told Nora all about this and said that her kids were already acting like their other mom, and that they're too young to be exposed to these kinds of things. She told me my concerns were baseless and that as their mothers, it was their job to worry about this. \n\nI told her she didn't worry about this and that's what caught me off guard. Nora got really mad and told me to keep my judgemental comments to myself and not forget that Catherine is also their mother. I just raised one concern.

To be fair my grandson knew more than my granddaughter but she'll also get there. They share all of their views with Catherine about these things.

The worst people are those who continue to push their will onto others and I see it all the time where I live (southwest United States where Mormonism is EXTREMELY prominent).

Good for her for rising above the prejudices you tried to instill in her and being open to viewpoints other than her own.", "YTA, though I don\u2019t think this is fake. I was one of those kids that started talking about all this politics stuff really early too. \n\nFirst, parents have a right to teach their kids whatever they want. \n\nTwo, when you say the kids are \u201ctoo young to be exposed to\u201d the \u201cpropaganda\u201d, what you really mean is that you don\u2019t want them to be incorruptible. As in, they\u2019re too young to learn conservative values, but not too young to learn yours.

Conservative brainwashing is very blunt and in your face, which is why people have such extreme reactions from it and it is easier to part from from a rhetoric perspective. Liberal brainwashing though, and this is from firsthand experience, as a kid you won\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening until you grow up, and it has taken me years to undo the damage caused by it and I still don\u2019t know that I have, nor do I have any confidence that I will ever do so.\n\nThus, if you insist on this path, tread carefully\u2026", "Yes, Grandma you are the AH.

Nonetheless children that young shouldn't hold strong political values because I believe it can be really damaging to them as they get older (e.i. if the grandson wants to try wearing a dress and remembers how thats viewed by the conservative side of his family).

Also, teachers usually count with pedagogical tools to ensure learning, something many parents (as you can tell from OP) don't have. \n\nAs children grow up and start understanding more how the world works and the complexity of it all, they should absolutely learn about more relevant issues from both their parents (for generally subjective perspectives) and schools (for a more objective concept-focused perspective).

When you don't allow your children to form their own opinions and shove your own views down their throats then you are not providing a healthy environment. You can express your opinion, sure, but children this young should not be being taught things like taxes and finances.
