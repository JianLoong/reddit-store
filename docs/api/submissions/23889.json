People disagree, you can choose to agree to disagree and avoid conversations that are linked to politics instead of pushing your own beliefs on another person. The worst people are those who continue to push their will onto others and I see it all the time where I live (southwest United States where Mormonism is EXTREMELY prominent). They are children now and when they grow older, they will be able to make their own decisions on politics and how they feel about it.

Let them make their own opinions when their ready, just like your daughter did, though it goes against yours.\n\nI actually was just talking to a woman who is a lesbian and she was very annoyed that people just assume she\u2019s liberal. She\u2019s quite conservative. It made for some lively discussions, as I\u2019m not conservative. I do think you shouldn\u2019t assume that your daughter would be liberal just because part of the lgbtq community. I\u2019ve known many that aren\u2019t and making generalizations is never a good idea. \n\nThat being said, many kids that age spout what their parents say. Religion, beliefs and such. This is normal. It doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t going to change and by being in their lives, they\u2019re going to see that others have different opinions and when they\u2019re older they may decide against their parents.

Did *you* bring up these topics with the kids? Did the 6 YO bring up these topics to you himself? I find the latter hard to believe. If you brought up these topics with the kids yourself, YTA. No kid wants to talk about abortion, economy, and taxes with grandma and grandpa at 6 and 8 years old. Especially when the family can\u2019t even have a meal without arguing over politics.\n\nRegardless, I still think YTA for how you frame views that differ from your own as \u201cproblematic\u201d.

It's really weird that you think Catherine should agree with you politically (on the economy? and healthcare?) just because she's gay.

If you haven't seen each other - due recently to scheduling conflicts, yikes - in like 3+ years, you aren't really in a position to comment on their parenting or what the kids are like. It seems like you attempted to raise this tactfully but still insulted your daughter in the process - first by suggesting she shouldn't be ok with how SHE and her partner are raising their kids, by presuming to know her position on these topics, and by acting like your first visit in YEARS gives you a right to critique. I think you should have let more time go buy and continued to get to know the kids and their moms before inserting yourselves.

Nora is right; it's not your business how she and Catherine raise their children.  Good for her for rising above the prejudices you tried to instill in her and being open to viewpoints other than her own.", "YTA, though I don\u2019t think this is fake. I was one of those kids that started talking about all this politics stuff really early too. \n\nFirst, parents have a right to teach their kids whatever they want. \n\nTwo, when you say the kids are \u201ctoo young to be exposed to\u201d the \u201cpropaganda\u201d, what you really mean is that you don\u2019t want them to be incorruptible. As in, they\u2019re too young to learn conservative values, but not too young to learn yours. And unfortunately I\u2019m this day in age parents are having to teach things earlier and earlier because activists for the other side are getting to them before they have the mindset to know better. \n\nYou may think they aren\u2019t because liberal value type of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d is a lot more subtle than the brainwashing of a conservative. Conservative brainwashing is very blunt and in your face, which is why people have such extreme reactions from it and it is easier to part from from a rhetoric perspective. Liberal brainwashing though, and this is from firsthand experience, as a kid you won\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening until you grow up, and it has taken me years to undo the damage caused by it and I still don\u2019t know that I have, nor do I have any confidence that I will ever do so.\n\nThus, if you insist on this path, tread carefully\u2026", "Yes, Grandma you are the AH.

A six and eight year old should seriously not even know about abortion let alone have opinions.", "NTA \n\nYou've successfully raised her and were offering guidance. Nonetheless children that young shouldn't hold strong political values because I believe it can be really damaging to them as they get older (e.i. if the grandson wants to try wearing a dress and remembers how thats viewed by the conservative side of his family).

Also, teachers usually count with pedagogical tools to ensure learning, something many parents (as you can tell from OP) don't have. \n\nAs children grow up and start understanding more how the world works and the complexity of it all, they should absolutely learn about more relevant issues from both their parents (for generally subjective perspectives) and schools (for a more objective concept-focused perspective).
