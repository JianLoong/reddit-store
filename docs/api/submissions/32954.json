This might be out of date because it was in a study years ago, but your GPS location is more identifying than your fingerprints. Even if it's just with sharing with someone you \"trust\" the tech will keep some kinds of persistent logs that you probably won't have a lot of control over.  IIRC in that study they needed 9 or 11(can't remember exactly) data points matching on two fingerprints to confirm they came from the same finger. That could be done with 4 matching data points from general user GPS location history. \nThat level of identifiability is something very reasonable to be concerned with and is very much a personal choice.

It's purely because the world can be dangerous and I like to know he arrived home safely because I love him. \n\nSo OP my question is, do you have an issue with sharing your location because a- you're doing things you don't want her to know about often and don't want to get caught, b- you don't trust her with that information for some reason, or c- you think she's insecure in your relationship and will likely check up on you too often? \n\nAll of those reasons are indicative of a larger problem in your relationship that you may need to communicate / address.", ">There is nothing more liberating though than if I'm driving and I say hey can you go to X,Y,Z message and tell them we're on the way.\n\nOh yeah asking them to do something on your phone is one thing but the previous commenter was talking about having your partner just go through your phone which I don't think is healthy", ">You have nothing to hide but clearly have messages you want to hide.\n\nThere's a difference between hiding something and just not wanting people to read every message I've sent", "I don't really think they're trying to hide messages or hide their location, I think the OP just wants some privacy, which I think is reasonable.\n\nIf the girlfriend sent OP a message asking them where they were, and they refused to reply, then I would consider that \"hiding.\" Or if the girlfriend asked to read OP's messages with their cousin or something, and they refused, then that would also be hiding.\n\nBut wanting to keep your messages on your phone private isn't a bad thing. It doesn't mean the OP wants to hide things from their girlfriend. It simply means they want to have something that is separate from their girlfriend. They want to be able to go to a coffee shop to relax without the girlfriend knowing where they are at all times. They want to be able to text someone without worrying about whether this is something they would want their girlfriend to know. Hell, maybe they want to vent to a close friend about an argument they had with their girlfriend over text, without her reading all of the messages and freaking out again, just to name a few examples.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that OP isn't saying two different things. You're allowed to not share things with your girlfriend. That's not suspicious or odd, and it doesn't mean they're hiding something. It simply means they want privacy occasionally.", "They are not. They are saying that's they want to be their own person, with established boundaries.\n\nThis is something everyone should be encouraged in.\n\nNo one, regardless of gender, should be forced to share their location with a partner.", "let me read your messages, if you dont your hiding something. Really? Have you any idea just how paranoid and controlling that shit sounds? Its straight up creepy", "I don't understand why it is safer.\n\nConsider a similar situation. Video cameras don't prevent theft, they help catch thieves but don't deter the actual theft. (The \"we are recording\" signage deters theft, but not the recording itself. And location tracking doesn't come with a sign.)\n\nHow does having one's location tracked improve safety? Also, if one's phone is trackable, does that mean that its charged enough to be used to call?", ">That doesn't keep you safe though\n\nEither does sharing my location with my girlfriend. \n\n\"WHY this is so important to you\" Because I am entitled to privacy. \n\n\"Presumably she knows where you are pretty much all the time anyway?\" Yes and there's no need to track someone. If you need to check where they are you can always text them and ask", "Lol, I can\u2019t be mad at that. Good reply, friend.", "You first, buddy.", "No no, you've missed the question, it was precisely about your precise case and context, where \"all those insecurities are far behind\" - would you respect your partner's choice or would you insist/accuse?", "He added: \u201cStop with the \u201cThis\u201d comments. Clearly you have nothing to add to the discussion so don\u2019t even bother.\u201d\n\nHope this helps :)", "I very clearly wasn\u2019t trying to add something to the discussion. I\u2019m just annoyed by people who only comment \u201cThis\u201d. I thought that was obvious in my comment.", "It seems like you're not really listening to what I'm saying.\n\nThe problem is the way she reacts when he declined being tracked.", "Hm. Maybe it\u2019s a setting on the senders side. My partner just sent me a pic of my location cause I panicked after reading your comment \ud83d\ude02 he doesn\u2019t share his location with me.", ">The downside is a complete lack of privacy.\n\nMy location is not all the privacy I have in life. Sharing it with my partner doesn't remove my privacy. He is my life partner, not my controlling bf.\n\n>Then why not just do that instead of tracking someone?\n\nBecause I am not that kind of person that calls his partner when he is out at night to ask \"Are you coming home soon ?\", or call him in the middle of a meeting to ask him if he can pick up some milk. That's disruptive. \n\nThat's a matter of convenience. I don't see \"lack of privacy\" as a downside. He is my life partner. Why would I want to hide my location from him ? I can turn it off if I am shopping for gifts for him. It's not that complicated.", ">So OP my question is, do you have an issue with sharing your location because a- you're doing things you don't want her to know about often and don't want to get caught, b- you don't trust her with that information for some reason, or c- you think she's insecure in your relationship and will likely check up on you too often?\n\nNone of the above. Like I stated in the post I value my privacy", "If someone demands to read your messages, I guarantee there are other several other issues dooming the relationship to fail. My fianc\u00e9e has full access to my phone because 1) I have nothing to hide from her, 2) it's so boring and uneventful that she gets bored after two minutes, 3) I'm not about to start up some pointless debate about why I don't want her in my phone. Sure, if you trust someone then you shouldn't need to go through their phone. But if you raise hell because you don't want them going through your phone, you're definitely putting off a certain vibe", "Google maps location sharing shows your battery % as well. My partner and I have used it in situations as phones are dying and needing to know where to help in a car accident or other situation.", "Well okay!! I genuinely don't understand why sharing your physical location (just where you are, not what your doing or who you're with) with your significant other (literally 1 person) translates to loss of all privacy in your head.

I originally NTA and I still believe that because you have the right to make that decision with your personal data. I just still don't see how that is more important than a higher level of safety and convenience that your girlfriend is asking for. Good luck!", "This", "Except you are going looking for them. This is the SECOND one you've done it too. Whats with the obsession?", "I do hear what you're saying. His reason is \"I don't want to\". Fair enough but that means he's placing \"I don't want to\" as more important than \"I want to for safety and peace of mind.\" That would definitely make me mad. Hes NTA because he has the right to die on any hill that he wants, and so does she.", "Either way this is good to know, thanks! \ud83d\ude00", ">Because I am not that kind of person that calls his partner when he is out at night to ask \"Are you coming home soon\n\nYou can always message and not call.", "Your location is not a private thing. People see your location. It's not classified information. And it cannot really be used against you in a negative way. It's like saying the colors of your socks is private information. Anyone near you can see it.... and your gf knowing about your socks color doesn't change a thing.", "> I just still don't see how that is more important than a higher level of safety and convenience\n\nIt's not a higher level of safety and please explain why my girlfriends convenience is more important than my privacy and comfort?", "Oh, you again. Bore off then, homie.", "I\u2019m not out here searching for them. I comment this when I come across them. It\u2019s not an obsession lol. But if I\u2019m bothering you so much, I\u2019ll stop.", "He offered her a reasonable compromise to her safety concern that she instantly declined. If she has additional concerns it's her job to communicate that. He's not a mind reader.", "His reason isn't \"I don't want to\", his reason is \"I value my privacy and therefore I don't want someone to have access to my every move\". That is as important as \"I want to for safety and peace of mind\". \n\nEven if his reason was \"I don't want to\", that would be just as valid as hers, except she's not really looking good in this argument because she's being demanding and getting mad for not getting what she wants.", "Who cares what the fucking reason. It\u2019s a no. That\u2019s it. You don\u2019t get to force someone to be tracked at all times. Doesn\u2019t matter how hurt your little feefees are. Get over it and stop being controlling. Shit is creepy. What ever his reason is, is completely valid. No different than say a spouse not wanting to have sex. Any reason is valid.", "The problem is that she wont accept his reason. She said its suspicious and unreasonable. So not wanting his every move to be tracked is suspicious? That is some controlling paranoid bullshit", "That's... pretty much the same. When he is out, I don't want to bother him. I want him to have fun and not have to be on his phone for my sake. \n\nFor me, it has full of little advantages like that. It's not a HUGE help. It's just convenient. And I don't see it has a \"lack of privacy\". He is my husband, my location is not a private thing IMO. Same for him.", ">Your location is not a private thing\n\nYes it is. I'm entitled to not have someone know where I am every second of the day. \n\n\"Anyone near you can see it\" Having a stranger see me is very different to someone tracking where I am at all times.", "\"your location is not a private thing\" what fucking world do you live in lady?", "It is a higher level of safety. Argue with your girlfriend, not me. Also, you've yet to explain why it's actually such a big deal to you.

He is welcome to break up with her! I'm just saying I underhand why this is a problem for her.", "Relationships are literally all about feelings lmao.  Comparing this situation to rape is fully insane, insensitive, and disgusting. I am aware that she cannot force him. She hasn't. She can be mad though! Both parties here are welcome to break up with each other if they really feel it's that serious!!", ">That's... pretty much the same\n\nNo it's not.

What makes you think she would use it in a malicious way ?\n\nIt feels like your relationship has some unresolved trust issues. Either you assume the worst from your partner and that's not healthy, or you have reason to assume the worst but still stay with that person, which is not healthy either.

Please explain how I am safer by letting my girlfriend track me?\n\n\"Also, you've yet to explain why it's actually such a big deal to you\" I have explained repeatedly, you just don't seem to think privacy is a valid reason. Why do you not think you're entitled to privacy when you're in a relationship?", "How in the world is it a higher level of safety? She's not there, she doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't change anything about what's going on. And the only way she'd know if he was stuck on the side of the road or something is if she's constantly checking, which is invasive and untrusting, and he could just call her for help.\n\nAnd I'm not a man, I don't have male privilege, and I wouldn't ever constantly share my location with a partner. Either they trust me or not, and if they feel it necessary to check that I'm telling the truth about where I am, I don't want to be in a relationship with them. Privacy and trust are important, and OP clearly explained why it's a big deal to him, and it's the same kind of big deal to me", "Oh, I wish.

Why do you feel the need to always know where your partner is? Do you not trust them to just tell you if you ask?", "u would leave because... they want privacy?", "Your argument amounts to if you are in a trustworthy relationship you should be happy to be tracked.

Clearly you're not actually interested in them because you're just fighting with people, so just talk to your goddamn girlfriend instead. If you won't budge, she might break up with you. That's life.", "That's not what I said.\n\nWhat I said is that I wouldn't want a relationship where we are playing silly games of untrust. I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone that would assume I would use his location sharing with bad intents.\n\nRelationship are about trust. If my partner would think of me like someone that he cannot trust with his LOCATION, and if he would think I would be the kind of person to use his location against him, keeping tract and using it maliciously... yeah. I would totally reconsider. It's not about me not trusting him. It's about him not trusting me with something super basic that I can just call and ask. \n\n>Why do you feel the need to always know where your partner is?\n\nThat's the thing. I don't. I can count on my fingers the number of time I have looked at my partner's location in the last year. But every time, it was so damn convenient.\n\n>Do you not trust them to just tell you if you ask?\n\nI'll turn that question around. If your partner calls you and you tell her your location every time... why do you feel the need to hide it ? Why make her call you to ask ?", ">Your argument amounts to if you are in a trustworthy relationship you should be happy to be tracked\n\nNo. My argument is that if you are in a trustworthy relationship, your partner will not use your location as a tracking device. They will use it when it's convenient.  There is no \"privacy\" or \"tracking\". Just 2 human beings that share a trivial information about their life to make their partner's life easier when they wonder if their partner is still at work or on the way home.\n\nIt doesn't have to be complicated. It doesn't have to be all secretive and \"I want my privacy\". When you are in a trustworthy relationship, sharing your location is a convenience. Not an hindrance.", "Why do you keep avoiding the question?

Yes that\u2019s why we are together, but my needs and wants outside our dynamic don\u2019t change just because I get consistently kissed goodnight every night. If she cares that much where he is, she can always text and ask. Come up with a code phrase or something. I am not going around cheating, but I don\u2019t like the idea of people knowing my every move either. It\u2019s just uncomfortable.

It's fucking weird to share where you are all the time with people", "I'll be the contrarian here. Yes, you're the AH. In my experience, women view personal safety in ways I didn't imagine.

She does each time she rides fearing she will be kidnapped or driven somewhere and attacked. Every walk to an indoor garage was a chance to be attacked as well. I asked other women if this was common and told yes - they fear for the safety constantly. \n\nSo her request is simply saying \"I want to feel safe\". As far as your statement that there are sometimes you don't want her to know where you are -- well if it is for her benefit like Christmas shopping, you could tell her: \"from 5-7 pm I'll be off-the-grid Christmas shopping and will call you when i'm done.\" That would build huge trust. \n\nKids today are growing up with 24x7 GPS monitoring by their parents.
