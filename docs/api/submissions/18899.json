I rushed to her and got her up on her feet, and then brought her to sit on the bed. I asked her if she was in pain, to which she said she wasn't, and that she'd be fine after a while, and got up to go to the bathroom again, so I figured she really was okay and I just went to the living room to continue what I was doing before. I noticed she was being a bit dry and quiet once she came out the bathroom so I asked what's wrong, to which she didn't say anything and dismissed it, but eventually told me she found what I did \"insensitive\" and I showed her that I couldn't be relied on to be a good caretaker. I genuinely don't think I'm in the wrong here since she did technically tell me she was okay and was going to leave the room to go the bathroom first anyway.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nUpdate: I went to our room with a plate of snacks, and told her I'm sorry I wasn't caring, and admitted to being the AH and not making sure she's 100% okay and just leaving right after. I also voiced the need for communication, and emphasized that if she had announced that she wanted me by her side, then I would've dropped everything for that. But then, I also realize I should've done that on my own and not wait for her go-sign. In response to all this, she just nodded and hummed after I called out to her. I think she's planning on continuing with the silent treatment. I'll try my best to post updates.\n\nUpdate 2: So I got her to finally talk to me and she said that all she wanted was for me to act like \"the perfect, ideal wife\" and cater to her more and look out and worry for her even if she says she's fine. IMO, I think she's relying on this fantasy that she has and wants me to execute this. This isn't the first time she's done something like this and I think this was my last straw. In a fit of rage I yelled how I'm tired of the miscommunication and all this push-and-pull BS every time we have an argument. She started crying and said she was gonna leave the house (it's my apartment), but I told her to sleep on the bed and that I'll just sleep on the couch. Ugh, I really don't think this is gonna get solved easy.\n\nUpdate 3: We broke up. Lol. I'll start replying to people after a while once I've grasped the situation at hand, because everything seems like a blur right now.", "created_utc": 1685823394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zo5wf/aita_for_ignoring_my_girlfriend_in_pain/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You made sure she was okay, asked about her pain, and helped her get settled. It is understandable that you returned to your previous activity when she reassured you that she was fine and seemed capable of moving around independently.\r  \n\r  \nIt seems there may have been a miscommunication here, and she may have expected more follow-up care or reassurance. It's important to keep in mind that accidents can be emotionally unsettling as well, not just physically, and she may have needed some extra emotional support.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, this isn't an indication of your capability as a caretaker. In a moment of crisis, you showed up and provided immediate assistance. It's okay if you weren't able to fully anticipate her emotional needs in that moment. Relationships are about learning and understanding each other better over time.\r  \n\r  \nConsider having a conversation with her about this incident once the emotions have cooled down. Apologize for any unintentional insensitivity and assure her that you care about her wellbeing. You might also discuss how to communicate more effectively in future situations like this one.

This is like the women that complain their husbands didn\u2019t bring them the food they never told them they wanted.", "NTA, she\u2019s over reacting and your apology enables this behaviour.

Communication is incredibly important to a successful relationship.", "You are right about your concerns. She wants you to be some fantasy she has where you exist solely for her and to anticipate what she really wants. She needs to be the one apologizing to you. She is acting like a child by not communicating and expecting you to read her mind.

She sounds high maintenance.

Does she get randomly moody and expect you to know why? Does she expect you to know when she\u2019s hungry or sad or thirsty? Are you allowed to do things alone? If you are out alone does she constantly message you? Think about how she treats you and see if there\u2019s any red flags. The above ones are how my abusive ex started. 2 years of relationship was a lot harder to escape from then a couple months.", "OK, well FYI when someone slips and falls hard it's a good idea to try and figure out what happened.

It's not one that can be readily medicated. It MUST be worked on by the self-aware individual who is committed to improving it and changing FOR THEMSELF, for their OWN reasons.\n\nYou can be supportive and understanding and patient with them as they go through that lifelong journey of self-improvement. You can protect your own emotional core and ego by recognizing that it's often \"not about you\". You can lead a horse to the water. . . but you can't make it drink.\n\nYou wanna try to salvage things, my recommendation is wait for a calm in the storm. Maybe pay her a compliment or two (this personality style cannot help but puff up and glow when complimented). Then let her know you need her to listen to you and to get it all out. Or write it in a letter so she can read it at her own pace. Show 3-4 examples of this DARVO / self-victimizing pattern and explain how you really can't handle it long term. How you'd love to go to therapy with her to see if you can improve your \"miscommunication pillar in relationship\".\n\nIf she's not willing to at least own that she MIGHT have a problem. . . . well 3 years of non-marriage is REALLY small compared to 10-15years of dead-end relationship stress.", "> I feel like it'd be extremely childish to take a break over such a trivial problem.\n\nFor the sake of your mental health, please take a break from this relationship\n\nIf she's still adamant and stubborn with her mind games, rethink the relationship", "The thing is, this is NOT a trivial problem, this a foundation-level disaster in waiting.

Someone who falls back on it frequently isn't ready to be in a long term relationship.

Would I be better of with them or without them? \n\n3) There's nothing \"childish\" about ending a relationship over chronic communication problems and I'm worried that your mind went there. Any chance you were raised to be a caretaker for other people? Or over-accomodate other people's needs?

She fell, you immediately came to help, moments later she said she was fine. End of story. She cannot say one thing and mean the opposite and expect you to just know that. You are not a mind-reader.

People like her are the reason people like me get so frustrated. Lol.\n\nFor her to say she wants you to be the perfect, ideal wife is concerning. Nobody is perfect and that's just life.
