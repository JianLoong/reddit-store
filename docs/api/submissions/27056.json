{"id": 27056, "submission_id": "16l74ds", "title": "AITA For Getting My Husband Fired?", "selftext": "So I (27 F) have been with my husband (31 M) for 13 years now, married for 9. He was my first serious boyfriend and we were high school sweethearts. We got married right after I graduated high school, and moved in together right after he graduated college and got his own place. Everything was wonderful. \n\nI lost my job at the beginning of lockdown in 2020, but my husband was able to keep his as his. I continued to be a stay-at-home wife even after lockdown let up because my husband makes plenty to support us both and we\u2019re child-free. After 2 years as a SAHW, I wanted to go back to work, at least part time. I told my husband I wanted to return to work, which led to a long talk. After some hack and forth, we came to an agreement. If I can\u2019t find a job after 6 months, we\u2019d consider a sign that I should be a SAHW and he should be the breadwinner, and I\u2019d find an out-of-the-house hobby to engage in.\n\nWith some help from my husband, I gathered references and fired up my resume, but nothing ever came of it. It\u2019s been two months since we reached the end of our agreement, and I\u2019m back to being a SAHW. A couple weeks ago, I was out with one of my friends, Sarah (34 F). Her husband (35 M) is long-time friends with my husband. We were having brunch and I told her that my big job search failed and that I\u2019m sad about being a SAHW again because I still haven\u2019t found a good hobby. Sarah gets visibly upset and says she\u2019s got something to tell me. She said she didn\u2019t know how to say it and she was sorry for keeping it from me, but that she thinks her husband and my husband were the reason I never got a job. For background, the business I worked for before lockdown no longer exists. Before that, I worked at another small business owned by Sarah\u2019s husband. It\u2019s his and his brother\u2019s pet project next to their full time jobs. So he\u2019s listed as my most recent employer.\n\nSarah said she walked in on him a couple months prior badmouthing me over the phone. When she asked him what it was about, he wouldn\u2019t say, but eventually she got him to confess that he was tanking my chances at a job because my husband asked him to. Half of my references are professionals that my husband knows, and I suspect that they were also in on it. \n\nI was so angry that I went with my thought: get him fired so he tastes his own medicine. And I succeeded. When he found out what I did, he exploded on me, telling me he did it for us and our future family and that we could\u2019ve been so happy if I would\u2019ve just stayed at home and been a good wife. He called me a lot of names and told me to get out, so I went to my mother\u2019s house and I\u2019m still here. He\u2019s been blowing up my phone daily, sometimes angry, sometimes begging me to come home, but I want to let him sit in what he\u2019s done for a while before I go home. Part of me is sad though, and wondering if I did the wrong thing here. Was I the asshole for getting him fired?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m going to take a break because a lot of you are jumping down my throat and twisting my words. For those of you asking why I\u2019d go home or what I\u2019m going home to, clearly my HUSBAND. Yes this is rough patch and we\u2019re mad at each other, but we can talk and go to therapy and figure things out. For those of you saying I screwed us because we\u2019re no-income now, my husband can find another job. It\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019s also very good with his money and has saved and invested a lot, and our mortgage is paid off (the house was half-paid by his parents and given as a gift). We\u2019re going to be financially fine, even if we have to budget a bit harsher for a couple months. It\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t handle. I\u2019ll come back in a few hours and read through the top comments when the trolls are done.", "created_utc": 1694972780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16l74ds/aita_for_getting_my_husband_fired/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Holy shit,  how can he sabotage your life like that?  And do it behind your back, and lie to you about it.  That is pure evil.   You need to seriously consider leaving him.  He has no respect for you at all, you are his pet, and you will do what he commands you to do.  No life for you, you only serve him.

I am not so sure that should have been your focus in this situation. You should be looking for ways to get out of this abusive marriage. Yes, abusive. Him sabatoging your employement prospects was a way to control you and make you do what he wants. That is abusive. The marriage you are in is controlling and abusive.\n\nI think you should really be reflecting on this and truly consider maybe you married too young and married the wrong person. A true partner would compromise and want you to be succesful. Let me you ask you one very important question and one that I need you to consider. Let's say you go home to be his little trophy wife miding the house and do this for years and years. Then your 50. He collapses and dies, or has an affair and dumps you. Then what are you left with?\n\nNo skills, no employement history, and are basically thrown to the wolfs. Do you really want your livilhood to be depended on a man who has no problem manipulating the situation to get what he wants at the cost of your happiness.

Also, even if the company she worked for before is out of business, it's still the place of last employment. Lastly, if the friends husband did knowing bad mouth her and lied to prevent her from getting a job, that's a lawsuit right there.", "ESH. Everyone sucks here. You guys are both acting like children and now both of you guys are unemployed. By this point, I'd say get relationship counselling or a divorce, as this is not at all how a relationship should be.

His way or the highway mentality. Why does he have an issue with you working? It\u2019s not like you have children to stay home and raise. \n\nGetting him fired was stupid on your part.

With his income vs. yours (none) you would have had sweeter revenge.  Both are AHs", "He wanted you to remain a SAHW, but instead of telling you thst, he gaslight you into thinking he was supportive while cutting you off at the ankles. Your friend and her hub were complicit.\n\nBreak all ties to all of them. Your friend is no friend at all - she already KNEW but never mentioned it? That's not a friend.", "NTA. And not only is that horrible of him to do that to you, it's also a sign of financial abuse, which isn't surprising if he was with a 14 year old as an adult.

It's an AH move, but he did much worse to you. He lied to you and betrayed you. Just make sure you move forward without him. Divorce him and get back to work.\n\nLet me emphasize how outrageously abusive his behavior was. Please get him out of your life.", "So I think you had every right to be pissed and fully leave your husband over this. I'm also not super opposed to revenge as a way to demonstrate how messed up what he did was. \n\nBut, what did you think would happen when you got him fired? Did you think he would be like \"you got me there!\" and you two would continue to be happily married?\n\nI'm saying ESH because you knew what you were doing- and I don't blame you for it- but somehow seem shocked at the outcome.", "ESH.  It sounds like your marriage is over.  He lied and manipulated you and made a concerted effort to control your livelihood.  It is time to find someone who actually cares about you and values you as an equal.  Leave now!", "ESH - although definitely your husband is way worse. \n\nWhat an AH move to tank your attempts to get a job. \n\nBut for to take revenge like that was foolish and counterproductive. Better for him to stay employed while you work out a settlement.", "He did WHAT?? Excellent comeback, but how did you get him fired so quickly? Lots of questions, but at least you don't have kids together. Get divorced, and welcome to your new life without the lying, controlling, infantalizing partner you've had since you were a kid. Some other people here apparently don't think what your husband did is an immediate, permanent, and irrevocable deal-breaker, or you can just go try again, etc., but no. There would be no going back from that discovery for me.  \nEDIT: Ah, I just read how OP got him fired and what she did. I guess that pushes it to ESH for me.", "I\u2019m sorry but he wanted to control you keeping you home where you had to count on him find a job don\u2019t use his friends as reference and file for a divorce", "NTA... I know Reddit loves to jump to LEAVE HIM, but sometimes that is because the seriously screwed up things are what makes it to this forum.\n\nHe betrayed you by pretending to be on your side while actively sabotaging you. He got your refferences to talk badly about you. This is next level control freak phychotic behavior. I'd be checking for trackers on your car and phone. Who does this **?????**\n\nThere is only one way I'd consider staying with someone that does this, and that is if he got profesional mental health check up and family therapy. Aknowledged how wrong it was. Also if a job is what you want, keep trying. I'm guessing now that you are both unemployed, this may have moved up to a need by now. \n\nIn fact, you should alway have the means to support yourself because you never know when you need to escape. You should always have an escape planned if you are married to someone like this.", "NTA but definitely not the smartest thing as divorce and alimony would have been so much better for you", "Why were you ok at all with just staying home? You have no kids so what\u2019s the point of sitting at home doing absolutely nothing?", "Pleaae leave this man. Your life with him will constantly be you being controlled by him. He's manipulative, dishonest, abusive... and probably much more. Is that the family you want to raise kids in?

Burn all the bridges to anything remotely related to this narcissistic man.  Start over. NTA unless you think this can be fixed.  Everyone is awful.", "NTA.

And I succeeded.\n\nThis is the part that makes me think this is fake.\n\nIf you were angry, your immediate reaction would have been to confront and blow up at him. Not, \"let me come up with a sneaky scheme that will result in his being terminated at an indeterminate point in the future.\"\n\nAlso, I love how you gloss over the whole thing by simply saying, \"I succeeded.\" Really? It's that easy and that *quick* to get someone fired?\n\nOkay.", "ESH by stooping to his level you also became an asshole", "Esh...you got him fired? Really that what you decided was best?

More blame placed on your husband because he was using the power imbalance to manipulate and control you. You should have just left at that point.

He was my first serious boyfriend and we were high school sweethearts. We got married right after I graduated high school, and moved in together right after he graduated college and got his own place. Everything was wonderful. \n\nI lost my job at the beginning of lockdown in 2020, but my husband was able to keep his as his. I continued to be a stay-at-home wife even after lockdown let up because my husband makes plenty to support us both and we\u2019re child-free. After 2 years as a SAHW, I wanted to go back to work, at least part time. I told my husband I wanted to return to work, which led to a long talk. After some hack and forth, we came to an agreement. If I can\u2019t find a job after 6 months, we\u2019d consider a sign that I should be a SAHW and he should be the breadwinner, and I\u2019d find an out-of-the-house hobby to engage in.\n\nWith some help from my husband, I gathered references and fired up my resume, but nothing ever came of it. It\u2019s been two months since we reached the end of our agreement, and I\u2019m back to being a SAHW. A couple weeks ago, I was out with one of my friends, Sarah (34 F). Her husband (35 M) is long-time friends with my husband. We were having brunch and I told her that my big job search failed and that I\u2019m sad about being a SAHW again because I still haven\u2019t found a good hobby. Sarah gets visibly upset and says she\u2019s got something to tell me. She said she didn\u2019t know how to say it and she was sorry for keeping it from me, but that she thinks her husband and my husband were the reason I never got a job. For background, the business I worked for before lockdown no longer exists. Before that, I worked at another small business owned by Sarah\u2019s husband. It\u2019s his and his brother\u2019s pet project next to their full time jobs. So he\u2019s listed as my most recent employer.\n\nSarah said she walked in on him a couple months prior badmouthing me over the phone. When she asked him what it was about, he wouldn\u2019t say, but eventually she got him to confess that he was tanking my chances at a job because my husband asked him to. Half of my references are professionals that my husband knows, and I suspect that they were also in on it. \n\nI was so angry that I went with my thought: get him fired so he tastes his own medicine. And I succeeded. When he found out what I did, he exploded on me, telling me he did it for us and our future family and that we could\u2019ve been so happy if I would\u2019ve just stayed at home and been a good wife. He called me a lot of names and told me to get out, so I went to my mother\u2019s house and I\u2019m still here. He\u2019s been blowing up my phone daily, sometimes angry, sometimes begging me to come home, but I want to let him sit in what he\u2019s done for a while before I go home. Part of me is sad though, and wondering if I did the wrong thing here. Was I the asshole for getting him fired?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
