Volleyball is not the hill I'm dying on. \n2. She was required to choose ONE extracurricular activity. She has only ONE extracurricular activity. She chose volleyball. \n3. It is not a long-term or strenuous commitment. We're talking about two hours per week for four weeks. \n4. She enjoys volleyball. She didn't like being forced to attend practice.\n\nEDIT 2:\n5. She knew no matter what, barring illness or injury, that she was going to practice. It was clearly communicated and understood days in advance that going to the sleepover meant that attending practice was non-negotiable. She had a choice to not attend the sleepover.

They only told their child that she needs to participate in a physical activity outside the house. Any good pediatrician would recommend this for healthy growth and development. The parents didn't select the activity, they let their kids choose what activity to do. Much like eating vegetables, getting enough sleep, and regular bathing, physical activity is healthy. Developing the habits and skills to continue being active throughout their lifetime will prevent so many problems later in life. It's far easier to start young, easier to learn the moves and lessens the likelihood of injury  because younger kids tend to be more flexible. Pickleball was developed to get seniors to start being active. It's very popular, and so many who play have not done sports before, so there are many injuries. Good parenting choices include involving your children in activities, have them try various things to find what they like, and encourage them to meet their commitments.

My gymnasts were 7-12 years old and putting in a 15-20 hour week at training. In comp season, even more, as competitions were almost always Sundays and that wasn\u2019t a training day so it was an extra. These age groups are children - if you force them to make sacrifices constantly they will end up hating the sport. They also stop signing up for things because they know they\u2019re not permitted to have an off day or change their minds about doing it, so their logic is it\u2019s best to stay away.\n\nWe lost a lot of talented gymnasts over the years because their parents stepped over into our job - the expectations, discipline and high standards - and stopped doing their own of being their child\u2019s safe space, comfort and trusted confidant.\n\nMaybe this is a one off for you, but from the way you\u2019re communicating this issue you\u2019ll end up on that path for any hobby your child chooses to take up.

Ummm no, there are some activities that you should and, if necessary, make a child endure if there is a benefit for them even if they hate it. My nephew hated after school math aid. I tried to get him to go, his dad hated him going. Would it have changed the course of his life dramatically?  Probably not however, and ironically, he wants to be a chef and stumbles at proportions when baking and cooking so it takes him longer to both figure it out and when he tries to do it mentally without the calculator he makes more errors than he'd wish. That isn't to say math would change either, we just don't know. \n\nSo the idea that \"forcing a kid to endure an activity for extracurricular purposes\" is kind of understated in terms of benefits. Whether it can be a benefit is a whole different question.

You're doing a good thing for your daughter!", "ESH \n\nIt's pretty obvious that your daughter needs to start worrying about things like time management as well as priorities. If I'm right in my assumption she should be in either early middle school or late elementary, and \"I was tired from a sleepover\" isn't a super great excuse when teachers try and confront her about problems she may have in certain classes.\n\nAt the same time she's 11, she's a kid, let her be a kid. Nothing good comes from keeping her from doing social things like sleepovers or hangouts just because she has volleyball practice the next day. And it's important to note that, imo at least, 9am is REALLY early for any kind of sports practice, but that's probably just me. \n\nThis is something on the side but it's really important to remember; based on how you've talked about her being in Volleyball; Volleyball isn't a simple way to keep her off screens or to stay social. This is a sport, and injuries happen very easily in sports if the participants aren't at their best when participating. If you're daughter is struggling to get ready and taking at least 30 minutes to do so she might not be in any place to do practice. If she's not paying attention she could end up injuring herself or her teammates; it happens a lot and only takes one person. In middle school I played basketball, during a game one of my teammates tripped and sprained his ankle. So believe me when I say that if she doesn't feel up for practice then it's perfectly fine and ok to miss it. ESPECIALLY if this is specifically about her staying off phones and staying social. It's fine to punish her for not taking her commitments seriously and being reckless with her priorities and time, but also know that if something bad happens/happened you should take responsibility for making her do something that she didn't feel up to doing. Needless to say commitment is important, but it's also ok for her to do new things and change up her hobbies.\n\n(I also want to note that it's entirely possible that, even though she made the choice to play volleyball, she could have felt like she didn't have a choice in the matter and only chose volleyball out of familiarity rather than genuine interest or entertainment. I noticed that people asked if she actually enjoyed it and you either didn't respond or only said that she chose it cause she played for a couple years. Which tells me you don't actually know, and should probably have a heart to heart with her about whether she wants to actually stay in it or move to something else.)", "NTA but I never let my son stay somewhere befor a practice \u2026 but he\u2019s pretty self driven so I\u2019ve never had to say that but regardless he understands 100% he\u2019s so going to practice.

She ended up getting an injury about 6 weeks after that. Nothing too bad but I let her quit after that. \nI\u2019d also give her a pathway to having sleepovers again. Like you made a bad choice and the consequence is you feel like crap at practice but that is the consequence of your choice. I\u2019d let her go to more sleepovers but I would also let her know she still follows through on commitments tired or not. Then she decides how to manage herself. Since OP made a no more sleepovers stand then he has to follow through with that but maybe open up a dialog and set a time table or some pathway to let her prove herself capable of balancing things out so she can have sleepovers again. Otherwise I have found it feels less like the consequences of their actions and more like Daddy is being an AH. And you want to teach your kids self-regulation which requires an inate understanding of choices and consequences. Rather than a fear of punishment and sanction.

If you keep this up, you're either going to have a very stressed out child who resents you for setting her up to fail, or a very stressed out child who never feels like she's doing anything right and is paranoid about getting in trouble.

OP has stated multiple times that she enjoys volleyball and wants to keep doing it. She just didn't want to *that day* because she was tired.", "That extracurricular could have been anything. Band, choir, yearbook, underwater basket weaving.\n\nOP cares not about the type of extracurricular and instead on the commitment to said extracurricular. This is supposed to instill commitment and give the child a small taste of adulthood before being thrown in the deep end so they can deal with it when they get there. \n\nIf you chose not to decide, you still have made a choice and choices have consequences.", "True.  But \"a morning shift at work the next day\" is much more imperative than volleyball practice.", "You literally put her in a failing scenario and blamed her. Shes eleven, you're the adult, you know better.", "That\u2019s a parental consequence - something you manufactured.  Staying up late and being tired early the next morning is a natural consequence.", "Unfortunately it's impossible for your daughter go to sleep early at a sleeporver. It's out of her control.\n\nThere was one I'd gone to and I was so tired, but the others were loud,  giggling, squealing, being girls, etc. At one point, one of them pulled me out from my sleeping bag.  So,  no, until everyone is ready to sleep,  no one sleeps. Well... we were in the finished basement so everyone upstairs were probably sleeping.\n\nYou could pick her up at 11pm as an option. This way she can spendv sing tint with them.  Make sure to let her bring cool snacks or something else to the party.\n\nDoes she have to do sports? Does she know she doesn't have to do sports? Can she do something not through the school? Something she'd passionate about? If she's passionate about what she's doing,  being tired would not stop her.", "I mean, it still has to be age appropriate. A natural consequence of a four year old running into the street after being told not to could end up being far worse than deserved. If a parent let their kid run into traffic to teach them a lesson, that would be called negligence. \n\nI'm not saying this situation was negligent, but kids brains aren't fully formed and they have to learn things over time WHILE parents guide them and help them learn what the natural consequences are. An 11 year old is not mentally prepared to really understand the consequence here and is highly unlikely to pass up spending time with friends, especially in exchange for a practice session that she doesn't care about. \n\nTo just chuck your kid out there to learn a hard lesson without support is to be an asshole.", "If you truly believed that, you'd realize you're the one at fault for setting her up to fail.", "A night of fun that left them ill prepared for the following day is a very similar situation.", "For responsibilities? I do.", "It's easier to force them than actually find it, bc it means they need to actually care and spent time with her", "So you would care if she changed sports then? You did say \"could care less\" which means there is a level of caring to begin with, and her changing sports would annoy you on some level.\nOr did you mean \"couldn't care less\" which would make more sense in this situation.", "I didn't see the other thread.\n\nI'll be honest, I actually *do* agree that in this *particular case* the arbitrary commitment of \"one hour twice a week\" is within the reasonable range for a parent to impose from the outside if the child has no other extracurriculars. I dragged the kids to swimming twice a week, and between the bus ride and the fact that they were seldom at the same level (and hence not at the same *time*) that added up to more than an hour each time. Of course, I didn't expect them to *like* swimming. I just thought they needed to learn to swim for safety's sake.\n\nBut his language around it is weird as heck.", "My mom made me do piano for 10 years and it didn't make me appreciate it, and I can't even play these days.", "My mom never made me do anything I didn\u2019t want to do and now I can\u2019t do shit, I can\u2019t even do a fucking somersault.", "A \"small taste of adulthood\"? Adults get to make their own decisions about staying out late and whether they make it to the activity the next morning. There was nothing to do with adulthood in this.", "OP said in an update --\n\n1. She chose volleyball. I don't care if it's water polo or pool noodle jousting. It is her choice. Volleyball is not the hill I'm dying on. \n2. She was required to choose ONE extracurricular activity. She has only ONE extracurricular activity. She chose volleyball. \n3. It is not a long-term or strenuous commitment. We're talking about two hours per week for four weeks. \n4. She enjoys volleyball. She didn't like being forced to attend practice.", "Well yeah they probably aren't. 11 year olds don't drink. Hence why OP's daughter learned the lesson via sleepover + sport", "11 isn't too young to learn responsibility", "The problem with your example is OP's daughter was forced to do an extra curricular activity. So if you were forced into college and told not to party all night, you would maybe drop out. You're an adult with the ability to leave. She's a kid who was forced to go to practice. She can't leave. So you're analogy isn't a good one because the 2 things You're comparing don't have the same characteristics.", "But you weren\u2019t 11.", "But how do you learn that? My kid will stay up all night and she still has to go to school the next day. It\u2019s a low-stakes way to learn that lesson.", "Ah yes, you disagree so must be \u201cthe teens\u201d. I\u2019m 40+ and downvoted heartily.", "He said activity, not sport. It\u2019s important for an 11 year old to have an extracurricular activity in their life.", "Forcing a kid to attend an extra curricular activity that they didnt want to be in, then being calling them butthurt when they are upset that they are being forced to do something they dont want to doesnt teach responsibility. It teaches you that the people who you are supposed to trust and rely on to take care of you, dont give a fuck about what you think.\n\nResponsibility is \"Hey, i know you wanna be in X sport, but if you want to continue to be in the sport, you have to keep your grades and attendance up, and if you cannot do that, then you cant attend anymore\"  \n\n\nRead the rest of OP's comments. They arent teaching their kid responsibility. They are teaching an 11 year old that its okay to coerce people into doing things, then making them feel worse when they dont want to do it.", "Right, an 11 year wouldn't drink. But they would stay up all night before a sport or other activity. And until something like above happens, most won't understand why their parent says no", "No, it's about right", "You didn\u2019t read OP\u2019s edit, clearly.  OP\u2019s daughter chose to do volleyball.  The practice was also mandatory, so excepting illness or injury she had to be there.  Kid was well aware of that.  Learning lessons like that early prepares them for when they are an older teen or adult and peer pressure becomes greater, but they also have to juggle their responsibilities.  Sure, youth volleyball may not be as important as college, but the principle is still the same: you made a commitment to be there, and time and money has been invested for you to be there, so, at the bare minimum, you need to show up and play your part.", "Oh no, forcing your kid to get physical activity! What awful parenting. The list of crap parents force their children to do for their own well-being: school, bedtime, read, brush their teeth/hair, take showers, chores, wear deodorant.", "Ding Ding Ding.", "I partially agree\u2026 I believe some thighs must be prevented (hence introducing punishments )\u2026 others can be learned with natural consequences. Like\u2026 the consequences for not studying as a kid is that you have to repeat the year\u2026 that is a year of life wasted therefore it is better to prevent it altogether from happening with proper punishments along the way. On the other hand the fact that skipping practice is bad can be taught by being kicked out from the team!", "11 is exactly when they should be learning lessons lol when should they?? When already adults?? Give me a break. If she tries different sports and doesn\u2019t enjoy any of them then after a couple years of giving a fair shot, try something else out and change scope.", "Nope. Daughter chose volleyball because she was FORCEd to choose an extra curricular and volleyball was the least objectionable.", "Agreed. As the parent, OP should have taken the L for allowing this in the first place. I agree that OP's tone is judgmental and doesn't seem like they're self-reflecting. Instead of saying \"you have another opportunity to live up to your commitment,\" they could say, \"What did we learn here?\" And both reflect. OP's reflection probably could be, \"I should not have allowed this sleepover at all. I should have asked for it to be another night.\"", "Frankly, OP is at fault here and is trying to blame an 11 year old.", "Agree.  Honestly at the girl sleepovers I had as a kid, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to go sleep somewhere earlier than the others.  They tended to have everyone in one place\u2026the bedroom or family/living room.  Not that easy to do.  OP sort of set her up for failure.", "And the to ask the internet to validate his worries about being an asshole instead of accepting that his plan didn't work out and he made a mistake...", "He\u2019s unbelievably rigid. I tell my kids to this day this is not a democracy,it\u2019s a dictatorship. It may be a dictatorship but a benevolent one so you can state your case but if after you\u2019ve stated your case I stick by my decision then you need to let it go."]}
