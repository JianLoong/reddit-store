You have to set her up for success. We have a rule that if there\u2019s plans/practice/an event, etc., there\u2019s no sleepovers allowed the night before. For example, kiddo (age 12) does theater and has rehearsals on Saturday mornings. Therefore, no sleepovers on Friday nights.

Some kids play so many sports year round and that rule would basically mean they could basically never attend a slumber party which I think is unreasonable.  I do think she had the natural consequence of being late and having to practice on no sleep.  No more sleepovers on volleyball mornings is reasonable for the rest of this season (3 more weeks or less ?).  I wouldn\u2019t necessarily make it a forever rule though.

They only told their child that she needs to participate in a physical activity outside the house. Any good pediatrician would recommend this for healthy growth and development. The parents didn't select the activity, they let their kids choose what activity to do. Much like eating vegetables, getting enough sleep, and regular bathing, physical activity is healthy. Developing the habits and skills to continue being active throughout their lifetime will prevent so many problems later in life. It's far easier to start young, easier to learn the moves and lessens the likelihood of injury  because younger kids tend to be more flexible. Pickleball was developed to get seniors to start being active. It's very popular, and so many who play have not done sports before, so there are many injuries. Good parenting choices include involving your children in activities, have them try various things to find what they like, and encourage them to meet their commitments.

My gymnasts were 7-12 years old and putting in a 15-20 hour week at training. In comp season, even more, as competitions were almost always Sundays and that wasn\u2019t a training day so it was an extra. These age groups are children - if you force them to make sacrifices constantly they will end up hating the sport. They also stop signing up for things because they know they\u2019re not permitted to have an off day or change their minds about doing it, so their logic is it\u2019s best to stay away.\n\nWe lost a lot of talented gymnasts over the years because their parents stepped over into our job - the expectations, discipline and high standards - and stopped doing their own of being their child\u2019s safe space, comfort and trusted confidant.\n\nMaybe this is a one off for you, but from the way you\u2019re communicating this issue you\u2019ll end up on that path for any hobby your child chooses to take up.

Not staying out late or up late if it can be avoided when you have early morning plans is a common sense behavior that considerate and responsible people learn. This is how. Now do we some time throw caution to the wind anyways and just yawn our way through a morning work meeting? Yeah.

The problem here is that you run the risk of making her super resentful of volleyball at a pivotal junction between childhood and adolescence. Sport/activity should be fun and by taking this path you are making it seem like a chore that will be keeping her from her friends.\n\nPersonally I was a big sport kid but I even became resentful of one of my main sports because I pushed to keep it over other activities/sports and fell out of it completely.\n\nSport and activity is so important, but try to keep it fun.

That isn't to say math would change either, we just don't know. \n\nSo the idea that \"forcing a kid to endure an activity for extracurricular purposes\" is kind of understated in terms of benefits. Whether it can be a benefit is a whole different question. But the parent hoping to establish an activity that they hope benefits their kid shouldn't be scoffed at either. \n\nI think we can argue whethanother activity is more suitable but being a parent also shouldn't involve a case where their kid should be able to do whatever and the idea that their 11 and should know what to do 100% isn't exactly correct either. \n\nMy partner would eat tons of sugary snacks when she was 18 and wished her parents would have done more to restrict her from it.", "YTA.

As her parent you need to give that example and guidance.\n\nIn other posts you admitted this is something you made her do. She\u2019s not necessarily a rigid well seasoned sports kid. I think in this case making a child play a sport when they are over tired is a bad idea: could potentially lead to injuries if they aren\u2019t properly warmed up and ready to play.

I very quickly learned the value of a good night's sleep and was able to manage my own bedtime. It's a lesson I'll be teaching my own daughter at that age. You're doing a good thing for your daughter!", "ESH \n\nIt's pretty obvious that your daughter needs to start worrying about things like time management as well as priorities. If I'm right in my assumption she should be in either early middle school or late elementary, and \"I was tired from a sleepover\" isn't a super great excuse when teachers try and confront her about problems she may have in certain classes.\n\nAt the same time she's 11, she's a kid, let her be a kid. Nothing good comes from keeping her from doing social things like sleepovers or hangouts just because she has volleyball practice the next day. And it's important to note that, imo at least, 9am is REALLY early for any kind of sports practice, but that's probably just me. \n\nThis is something on the side but it's really important to remember; based on how you've talked about her being in Volleyball; Volleyball isn't a simple way to keep her off screens or to stay social. This is a sport, and injuries happen very easily in sports if the participants aren't at their best when participating. If you're daughter is struggling to get ready and taking at least 30 minutes to do so she might not be in any place to do practice. If she's not paying attention she could end up injuring herself or her teammates; it happens a lot and only takes one person. In middle school I played basketball, during a game one of my teammates tripped and sprained his ankle. So believe me when I say that if she doesn't feel up for practice then it's perfectly fine and ok to miss it. ESPECIALLY if this is specifically about her staying off phones and staying social. It's fine to punish her for not taking her commitments seriously and being reckless with her priorities and time, but also know that if something bad happens/happened you should take responsibility for making her do something that she didn't feel up to doing. Needless to say commitment is important, but it's also ok for her to do new things and change up her hobbies.\n\n(I also want to note that it's entirely possible that, even though she made the choice to play volleyball, she could have felt like she didn't have a choice in the matter and only chose volleyball out of familiarity rather than genuine interest or entertainment. I noticed that people asked if she actually enjoyed it and you either didn't respond or only said that she chose it cause she played for a couple years. Which tells me you don't actually know, and should probably have a heart to heart with her about whether she wants to actually stay in it or move to something else.)", "NTA but I never let my son stay somewhere befor a practice \u2026 but he\u2019s pretty self driven so I\u2019ve never had to say that but regardless he understands 100% he\u2019s so going to practice.

She ended up getting an injury about 6 weeks after that. Nothing too bad but I let her quit after that. \nI\u2019d also give her a pathway to having sleepovers again. Like you made a bad choice and the consequence is you feel like crap at practice but that is the consequence of your choice. I\u2019d let her go to more sleepovers but I would also let her know she still follows through on commitments tired or not. Then she decides how to manage herself. Since OP made a no more sleepovers stand then he has to follow through with that but maybe open up a dialog and set a time table or some pathway to let her prove herself capable of balancing things out so she can have sleepovers again. Otherwise I have found it feels less like the consequences of their actions and more like Daddy is being an AH. And you want to teach your kids self-regulation which requires an inate understanding of choices and consequences. Rather than a fear of punishment and sanction.

She seemed cold and short with me but I was in a hurry and brushed it off. I mentioned the encounter to my sister and she said Amanda was upset by my gift as it wasn\u2019t something off the registry.  I was totally caught off guard.

This is not a developmental league where we're traveling every weekend and she clearly hates it. \n\nThis is simply whether a child who makes a choice for an activity should be required to follow through. If they're ill or injured, they wouldn't be required.

Physical activity is also beneficial. That doesn't have to happen as part of a sports team, but it's undoubtedly beneficial for social development and is an excellent opportunity to teach children how to deal with success and failure in a healthy manner. I am aware that many people find playing sports to be intimidating/embarrassing, so it's worth noting that you can get lots of that from things like debate clubs or chess clubs or science competitions.

If she enjoys volleyball as much as you say she does, then this is how to help her develop that part of her brain.
