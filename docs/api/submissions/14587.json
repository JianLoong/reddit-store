Her mother (44F) and I have always wanted to make sure our daughter got the most out of her life. I was a highschool drop out and my wife dropped out of college her second year. We didn\u2019t want that for our daughter. We held her to expectations: getting good grades mainly. This led to us being very strict with her. Her life was go to school and come home. Nothing in between. \n\nMy daughter graduated from Highschool as the valedictorian of her class. She decided against my better judgment, to be pre-excepted to University and take a gap year to earn herself a bit of saving. We never saved money for her future. Last week she met with the school's admission counselor. I dropped her off. Around the time I was supposed to pick her up tried calling her but she never answered. I had to get to work so I called my wife. She said she\u2019ll figure it out. A while later I get a call back from my wife saying our daughter was fine but upset. \n\nWhen I dropped my daughter off, She had met up with an old friend, Ariana. They got to chatting about highschool and Ariana talked about how she was on the All-Star team, the Student Representative, and more. My daughter said she graduated as valedictorian. But besides that she didn\u2019t do much. No sports, no hanging out, No job, nothing. Ariana said, \u201cWow, you\u2019re life was boring.\u201d My daughter was hurt. She ended up missing her meeting to go cry. She called my wife. She said \u201c How come my life is like this? It\u2019s like I have no purpose, I was just made to be a trophy child. You guys didn\u2019t let me do anything! I couldn\u2019t even walk outside without one of you with me! I feel so trapped, like a prisoner. It was the same thing every day. No change. I\u2019m nobody, I\u2019ve got nothing to show for my life.\u201d My wife said my daughter called one of her friends to pick her up and stay with them.\n\nI was a little upset. We\u2019ve done so much for her and she\u2019s acting so ungrateful. I called my daughter. She apologized for skipping the interview and not telling me where she was. She said her friend would drop her off at home. I said not to bother.  If she didn\u2019t feel appreciative of the life she had here with me and her mother then she wasn\u2019t welcomed back. She started sobbing, apologizing profusely. I stood my ground even though it hurt inside to do so. She paused. I heard her drop her phone and a loud thud. I assume her friend came over to help her and I heard \u201cpanic attack\u201d The call went dead. \n\nWhen I got home my wife said our daughter had a panic attack. She was alright now but she said she wasn\u2019t coming back. Not explaining. I told my wife what I said to our daughter previously. My wife went red in the face and started screaming, saying I drove our daughter away. I said our daughter seemed to be ungrateful for all we\u2019ve done for her.\n\nIt\u2019s been a week since then and I haven\u2019t heard from either of them since.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681255741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12j1vi0/aita_for_being_strict/", "score": 276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm assuming you're in the USA - in that country, successful admission and funding at university depends strongly on the student being able to show evidence of leadership and broad interests.  A student with good marks and no interests, hobbies, volunteer projects, and sports activities, either in school or in the community, will not score highly to admissions officers, so you have not helped her to the kind of academic success you had hoped for her.  That might be because you don't know much about it -- but she's been in high school for three or four years, so your family has had the time to learn.  And if you weren't going to have money for her to go to university, you should have also been learning about what would be needed for her to get financial aid.  So I don't believe you that you want the best for her, actually.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think your daughter has made a good and difficult decision, stepping away from you and your wife, because I think your behaviour has been harmful and your self-justification suggests that you don't see anything wrong with it.

For refusing to allow her to participate in activities that would make her a well-rounded student and more attractive to universities?\n\nShe's absolutely right.  She was your trophy child.  You showed no concern for her mental health.  You didn't allow her to develop social skills.  You did nothing financially to help her to attend college.

You are not the perfect father, a perfect father knows that he must care not only economically, physically but mentally, and this last one means that her development must be according her age: having friends, fun, doing chores at home and be good at school.

Anything extra was *your choice.* You need to face your flaws and what you did wrong. You need to accept that she is very upset and that you are part of the cause.

The reason kids do things like extracurriculars, socialize, go places alone, is because they are humans. Extracurriculars help kids learn skills and what they do and don\u2019t like. Socializing prepares them  for basically everything, and driving a car, going on public transport or whatever alone teaches them how to do things on their own when they\u2019re out of your house.

I am hoping and praying she finds a safe place to land and explore everything life has to offer.", "I have no doubt whatsoever that you love your daughter very much, the problem, is that you literally tied her hands and decided that you were going to plan out her entire life for her. This is like the very first time that she is even seeing anything of the world and she is starting to realize, very quickly, that she had literally no life outside of school and what you allowed her to do at home. \n\nShould you definitely not be kicking her out because she obviously has not been prepared for life at all, something you did to her specifically by the way, but, you're saying all of this as though you didn't owe her that. When you decide to have a child, you owe that child, everything you can give it. That is all. That child owes you absolutely nothing. You decided to bring her into this world and then you decided to keep her in a box and now you want to kick her out because she isn't exceptionally grateful that you provided the bare minimum and prevented her from even enjoying the small things she had if she got below so much as a B+??\n\nYour entire post reads as an overbearing and controlling father. YTA - apologize to your wife to start with and figure out next steps.

Hear her out, admit your mistakes and explain your reasoning without making excuses, and see how you can support her in her life other than just school. Also , apologize for putting so much academic pressure without saving for her future, because that is also a majorly big mistake.

Her mother (44F) and I have always wanted to make sure our daughter got the most out of her life. I was a highschool drop out and my wife dropped out of college her second year. We didn\u2019t want that for our daughter. We held her to expectations: getting good grades mainly. This led to us being very strict with her. Her life was go to school and come home. Nothing in between. \n\nMy daughter graduated from Highschool as the valedictorian of her class. She decided against my better judgment, to be pre-excepted to University and take a gap year to earn herself a bit of saving. We never saved money for her future. Last week she met with the school's admission counselor. I dropped her off. Around the time I was supposed to pick her up tried calling her but she never answered. I had to get to work so I called my wife. She said she\u2019ll figure it out. A while later I get a call back from my wife saying our daughter was fine but upset. \n\nWhen I dropped my daughter off, She had met up with an old friend, Ariana. They got to chatting about highschool and Ariana talked about how she was on the All-Star team, the Student Representative, and more. My daughter said she graduated as valedictorian. But besides that she didn\u2019t do much. No sports, no hanging out, No job, nothing. Ariana said, \u201cWow, you\u2019re life was boring.\u201d My daughter was hurt. She ended up missing her meeting to go cry. She called my wife. She said \u201c How come my life is like this? It\u2019s like I have no purpose, I was just made to be a trophy child. You guys didn\u2019t let me do anything! I couldn\u2019t even walk outside without one of you with me! I feel so trapped, like a prisoner. It was the same thing every day. No change. I\u2019m nobody, I\u2019ve got nothing to show for my life.\u201d My wife said my daughter called one of her friends to pick her up and stay with them.\n\nI was a little upset. We\u2019ve done so much for her and she\u2019s acting so ungrateful. I called my daughter. She apologized for skipping the interview and not telling me where she was. She said her friend would drop her off at home. I said not to bother.  If she didn\u2019t feel appreciative of the life she had here with me and her mother then she wasn\u2019t welcomed back. She started sobbing, apologizing profusely. I stood my ground even though it hurt inside to do so. She paused. I heard her drop her phone and a loud thud. I assume her friend came over to help her and I heard \u201cpanic attack\u201d The call went dead. \n\nWhen I got home my wife said our daughter had a panic attack. She was alright now but she said she wasn\u2019t coming back. Not explaining. I told my wife what I said to our daughter previously. My wife went red in the face and started screaming, saying I drove our daughter away. I said our daughter seemed to be ungrateful for all we\u2019ve done for her.\n\nIt\u2019s been a week since then and I haven\u2019t heard from either of them since.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
