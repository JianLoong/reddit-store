She\u2019s 2 years old and has always gone outside. He is stopping that as he said she injured her paw quite badly and had scratches on her after another cat attacked her. He said a few of his neighbours have become concerned recently as their cats have also become injured. She was quite poorly and it cost him a lot in vet fees. He said that he gets it\u2019s a change for Libby as she has been meowing at the door to be let out but that it\u2019s for her health and safety and he said he\u2019s planning on building some outside open air cage thing so she\u2019s still outside but concealed in it.\n\nI was there the other night and Libby was meowing at the back door. I said that it wouldn\u2019t hurt to let her out as she was very loud. He says he just ignores her for 10 minutes and she\u2019s fine and told me not to let her out. She seemed really insistent so I let her out. Bf was none the wiser but after a while he noticed how quiet his house was and started to look for Libby as she normally cuddles him after not being let out. He started freaking out when he couldn\u2019t find her  and I told her I let her out. He got really angry and asked \u2018why the fuck would you do that when I told you I don\u2019t want MY cat outside?\u2019 He started saying I\u2019m rude, insensitive and horrible for what I did. Libby came back after like an hour. She was fine.\n\nMy bf kicked me out and has been cold to me since. He says that he doesn\u2019t trust me in his house anymore or near his cat. She\u2019s a really sweet girl and I love her and I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong. I think he\u2019s being really paranoid just cos she got hurt once. I\u2019m trying to make him see my POV that he\u2019s being too overprotective and he says I\u2019m an AH and that he needs some space from me.", "created_utc": 1679216505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vg7sp/aita_for_letting_my_boyfriends_cat_outside/", "score": 9221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He got out the other day when I was bringing stuff in and we're right back to beginning and he's once more banging and meowing and waking me up because all that work was undone. You're bf has a lot of work ahead of him, training an outdoor cat to be an indoor cat and you've just put that back by teaching Libby that she just has to carry on to be let out. I'd be mad af too. \n\nRegardless of all of that, he asked you not to and you blatantly ignored his request and honestly, that alone makes you TA.", "YTA. You completely ignored your boyfriends request to not let the cat out. He has decided it\u2019s in her best interest for her not to go outside anymore as he is worried she will get hurt again, or even worse. \nYou ignored his feelings and did what you wanted to anyway. She is not your cat and it\u2019s not up to you if she goes out or not.\nIf something had happened to her while she was out your boyfriend would not forgive you.", "YTA\n\nHe told you to not let his cat out. So as an idea, maybe do not let his cat get out.", "I don't understand why you would let her out.  You have just undone all the hard work he's done to keep her inside.

Something is attacking cats in the local area. This something has attacked your bf's cat. The cat 'was doing poorly'. Your bf had to pay a lot of money to heal his cat. He made the decision to transition the cat to being an indoors cat bc there is something attacking cats in the area.\n\nAnd you decided to let the cat out bc she was crying. Into the area where something is attacking cats.\n\nHere's a thought for you. Kids will cry when you don't let them stick forks in outlets. Kids will cry when you don't let them stick toy figures up their nose. Kids will cry when you don't let them play in the street of a busy neighborhood. Kids will cry bc you make them put on jackets in freezing weather. Are you going to let kids do these things bc they're crying and they should be fine?\n\nThe thing is, animals are as dumb as kids. And if you wouldn't let a kid out into the night when there's something wild out there attacking small things, you should not let a cat out there. I don't care if that cat has been an outdoor cat all its life. It is time for that cat to be an indoor cat.\n\nYTA.

Sorry about that.", "YTA it's not hard to have basic respect towards other people's rules for THEIR pets. She's NOT yours and hopefully (coming from a cat owner who had to do the exact same thing you bf did) he will break up with you.

He's going to dump you. \n\nYou put his cat in danger after he explicitly told you not to. You were aware that his and other cats were being attacked in the neighborhood and you just didn't care. \n\nAnd as other commenters said, cats don't belong outdoors, as they also pose a danger to the local environment.\n\nYou'll never be able to rebuild the trust you lost.

He told you not to let HIS cat out, and you decided you knew better.", "YTA\n\nYou think your boyfriend is \"paranoid\" - no, he made a safe decision for his cat.

You mentioned the meowing. He told you not to let her out. You did what you wanted to do anyway.

Of course the cat wants to go outside. That doesn't mean it gets to. It is being trained now to stay inside. I have had to train outdoor cats to be indoor cats to keep them safe as well. It's a process. And one you really set back with your irresponsible decision. Just because the cat came back doesn't mean it was safe. The way you answer people here I get the distinct feeling you don't like the cat and wouldn't really mind if it got hurt/didn't come back. \n\nQuestion: Are you as cold and callous when talking to him about this as you are in your responses to people here?   \n\n\nWhat it comes down to though, and the reason many people would break up with you, is that you directly went against his express wishes, and did it behind his back. You let the cat out, without saying anything to him. You hid it. You knew it was wrong. But you did it anyway.   \nIt's not even about the cat. Its that you did something he very specifically asked you not to, and you did it in his home, behind his back, and didn't tell him until he couldn't find the cat.", "The fact that you think you did nothing wrong is horrifying.", "YTA for blatantly disrespecting your BF\u2019s requests about HIS cat, YTA for your flippant attitude, and YTA for posting in this subreddit to seek advice then doubling down in every comment you made about how right you are.

If someone tells you not to let their cat out, you don't let their cat out, that's it. \"Oh, but she was so insistent and she really wanted to go outside!\" Doesn't matter.

It's about doing what is best for her, and as it seems right now, it's to keep her inside.\n\n\"She's an outdoor cat!\" Nope. Maybe she once was, but now her owner, as in the actual person who owns her and takes care of her and loves her and *has to pay for the bill if she gets hurt again*, has decided that it's not worth the risk, so he's keeping her inside for her own safety. That's it.\n\n\"She didn't get hurt though.\" Doesn't. Fucking. Matter. He told you not to let her outside because he doesn't want to risk her getting hurt again, and you didn't listen. He's not overprotective - he is adequately protective. It is not for you to decide what he should and shouldn't do for his cat, and it is certainly not for you to decide whether he should or shouldn't be upset about this. The majority of outdoor cats get killed by wildlife, cars or sometimes just horrible people. His cat got lucky.\n\nWhen someone tells you how to look after their pet, you listen.

You clearly are having a disconnect in understanding how he feels about the cat, on top of your lack of empathy and understanding for the situation. OP, at some point you need to learn what it means to be responsible for another life. You aren't the one paying the vet bills, you aren't the one taking care of the cat. It's better for cats and the native wildlife for cats to be indoors. If you want to be a supportive partner, figure out how to get the enclosure up for him or help him pay for it or something.

What you did is a HUGE breach of trust; your BF was trying to be a responsible cat owner, not being \"overprotective\".

In the USA its really common for cats to be indoor cats and the only thing that matters is that their needs are met indoors.\n\nThe outdoors in not a magical need for cats. Exercise, stimulation, and diet are.\n\nThey key thing is not about what you think of cats being indoor or outdoor or a mix. It's that it's Not Your Cat.

Honestly, would've even broken up with you.

It's a genuine concern.\n4) Some areas aren't safe for cats to go outside. Growing up we had many cats that always went outside, but when I got my bungalow I got a cat and she'd previously been an indoor cat and was a very scared cat so I kept her indoors as she was terrified of other people. I also only have a half fence and my neighbour has a dog. There's also lots of cats in my road (one neighbour has about 10 cats and I know of a stray cat who tested positive for FIV and her 10 cats weren't  vaccinated so likely had it as the stray fathered some of her cats. So there's multiple reasons why it's safer for my cat to live indoors. Some people live near trains or busy roads etc. \n5)Either way, it's not your decision. He would have been distraught seeing his cat injured and needing vet treatment, and being in pain etc, and would be scared of her being hurt again. That's not paranoia that's a realistic concern!!! He's the one that also has to pay the fees for all the treatment if she's injured again. Maybe hes worried he wont be able to afford the treatment if shes hurt again? She could die from her injuries or from being hit by a car etc. \n6)What would you have done if she came back injured? Would you have paid hundreds of pounds in her vets treatment? \nOr what if she didn't come back at all? \n7)She's not your cat, and you had no respect for his decision. You could have tried discussing it and telling him your opinions, but at the end of the day it's HIS cat, not yours, and you should respect his decisions.\n8 )You've also counteracted any time he's spent getting her used to not going out. Now she will assume if she meows long enough at the door he'll eventually let her out, whereas she's started to settle after 10 mins previously.", "YTA. Big time. Nothing would change my mind about that, but your comments to others cement it in stone. I wouldn\u2019t trust you in my home either. You keep calling him your boyfriend.

People have given enough reason but your replies in the comments are just as bad as your post. For the sake of your BF, and his cat, I hope he doesn't let you near either of them again.", "YTA - he gave you clear cut reasons as to why he didn\u2019t want his cat outside and you out her out anyway. I\u2019d dump you, honestly.", "As a cat owner, YTA. Cats who are allowed to roam outside have a higher chance of dying young. She's already gotten injured once. And your bf is keeping her indoors for her sake. She doesn't understand it but you as a human should. If I were your bf, I wouldn't trust you in the same place as my cat either.", "YTA. Your boyfriend asked you not to do something, and you did it anyways. Just that alone makes you TA. \n\nBut since you don\u2019t seem to understand why it\u2019s so dangerous for a cat to be allowed outdoors (unless on a leash/in a protected area), let\u2019s talk about this glaring statistic: On average, indoor cats live 10-15 years, while outdoor cats live 2-5 years. \n\nWhy? \n\nCars - millions of cats are hit by cars every year, and the *vast* majority of these accidents are fatal. \n\nDisease - fighting with other cats can transmit diseases like FeLV, FIV, FIL, and feline distemper. Injuries, even minor ones, can lead to infections. \n\nParasites - fleas, ticks, worms, and fungal infections can all be picked up outside. Some of these can be transmitted to humans when brought back indoors. \n\nPoison - cats can get into poisonous things on their own(ex antifreeze), but they also might come into contact with rodents who have been poisoned through bait traps. If a cat consumes these poisoned animals, they too can die. \n\nWildlife - cats can be injured or killed by wildlife such as snakes, coyote, wild/feral or off-leash domestic dogs, eagles, big cats, etc. \n\nOther hazards - foxtails can cause major ear/eye damage. Cats that climb trees can take severe and sometimes fatal falls, or can get stuck long enough that they become dehydrated and begin to starve. \n\nHumans - some humans suck. It\u2019s not unheard of for outdoor cats to be shot at (with BBs or real guns), abused, or even just picked up by another family/animal control. \n\nAnd this doesn\u2019t even get into the massive toll that cats take on outdoor wildlife, such as bird populations. Cats can decimate bird populations, especially those of native songbirds. It also doesn\u2019t go into unaltered cats that are let outside and contribute to the large numbers of feral, homeless cats. \n\n\nSo yeah, she may have seemed \u201cfine\u201d for that hour you let her out, but you have no idea what she came in contact with this time, or what she might encounter next time. Also, *your boyfriend told you to not let her out.* And really, that should be all that matters. \n\n\nSources:\n\n[UC Davis Vet Medicine](https://healthtopics.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/health-topics/feline/cats-indoors-or-outdoors)\n\n[MDPI Publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7070728/)\n\n[VCA Animal Hospital](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/cats-and-the-perils-of-outdoor-living)\n\n[USDA](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/reports/Wildlife%20Damage%20Management%20Technical%20Series/free-ranging-and-feral-cats.pdf)\n\n[American Bird Conservancy](https://abcbirds.org/program/cats-indoors/cats-and-birds/)\n\n[The Humane Society](https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/our-position-cats)\n\n[PETA](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/why-peta/outdoor-cats/)\n\n[National Parks Service](https://www.nps.gov/samo/learn/management/cats.htm)\n\n[American Veterinary Medical Association](https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/avma-policies/free-roaming-owned-cats)\n\n\n(All edits are to add more links to sources)", "Info: \n\nDo you live with your boyfriend?

She\u2019s 2 years old and has always gone outside. He is stopping that as he said she injured her paw quite badly and had scratches on her after another cat attacked her. He said a few of his neighbours have become concerned recently as their cats have also become injured. He said that he gets it\u2019s a change for Libby as she has been meowing at the door to be let out but that it\u2019s for her health and safety and he said he\u2019s planning on building some outside open air cage thing so she\u2019s still outside but concealed in it.\n\nI was there the other night and Libby was meowing at the back door. I said that it wouldn\u2019t hurt to let her out as she was very loud. He says he just ignores her for 10 minutes and she\u2019s fine and told me not to let her out. She seemed really insistent so I let her out. Bf was none the wiser but after a while he noticed how quiet his house was and started to look for Libby as she normally cuddles him after not being let out. He started freaking out when he couldn\u2019t find her  and I told her I let her out. He got really angry and asked \u2018why the fuck would you do that when I told you I don\u2019t want MY cat outside?\u2019 He started saying I\u2019m rude, insensitive and horrible for what I did. Libby came back after like an hour. She was fine.\n\nMy bf kicked me out and has been cold to me since. He says that he doesn\u2019t trust me in his house anymore or near his cat. She\u2019s a really sweet girl and I love her and I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong. I think he\u2019s being really paranoid just cos she got hurt once. I\u2019m trying to make him see my POV that he\u2019s being too overprotective and he says I\u2019m an AH and that he needs some space from me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Outdoor cats (or indoor/outdoor) have a MUCH higher chance of dying earlier in life because they are more exposed to the elements as well as disease, injury, and um, oh I don't know, CARS! They are also subject to be stolen by other people. Not sure you know this but a lot of people get cats by just finding them outside. I also personally know people who have taken outdoor cats and strays in as well as someone who has had it happen to them, someone took their cat.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the massive massive massive environmental impact cats have on the environment. In the USA alone, outdoor cats kill over 1 *million* small birds a year! That's insane! That's JUST SMALL BIRDS!

I doubt it\u2019s because OP wanted the cat to get harmed, buuuuuut, OP was annoyed by the meowing and felt entitled to be in control of the situation, so she removed the cat because the meowing annoyed her and because she was told no. The whole it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d a cat is because she feels her momentary annoyance is more of a detriment to herself than the cat potentially getting hurt. OP probably didn\u2019t -want- the cat to be harmed, but views it as \u201cit is what it is\u201d because her not being annoyed is more important to her personally", "It\u2019s also called operant conditioning in English.

Your ability to justify ignoring the cat\u2019s owner- and to put that cat in danger are Off the charts. Most outdoor cat\u2019s have drastically shorter lives, and you need to stay in your lane or get out of the relationship.\n\nIf I was your boyfriend, I would put you outside and never let you back inside.   \n\n\nFYI,\u201dthe average lifespan of an indoor cat ranges from 10 to 20 years, whereas cats who go outdoors typically live only 2 to 5 years,\u201d ([https://www.thinkingoutsidethecage.org/pet-resources/behavior-help/cat-behavior-solutions/cats-live-longer-healthier-lives-indoors/](https://www.thinkingoutsidethecage.org/pet-resources/behavior-help/cat-behavior-solutions/cats-live-longer-healthier-lives-indoors/)).\n\nThe fact that the cat was already injured proves it is not safe outside. My cats are currently 16 and 18, and both still healthy and sassy. If my partner put my cats outside, they would find thier belongings outside as soon as I found my cats. And the locks would be changed. I hope your ex-boyfriend reads this post. I do not understand how you can actually think you are N T A.

She taught herself how to use the doggie door without me knowing and was missing for three terrible days. I hated keeping her cooped up, as a former free-range cat, and she would howl every night, but I was so afraid of what could happen to her. We compromised by letting her out when I\u2019m there to watch her, and she keeps up her side of the bargain by not going out of my eye sight and coming when I call her. (She\u2019s an unusually reasonable cat!) It was hard listening to her yowl at first, but it was far harder wondering if she was dead.", "Really depends on where OP is based. US, absolutely cats are an invasive species. Other places cats have been around long enough that they are considered native and the ecosystem has adapted to their presence. They'll still kill wildlife but they're not doing huge amounts of damage to the natural environment.\n\n\nETA: I agree that in this situation OP shouldn't have let the cat out regardless. It's not her cat and the owner said to not let her outside, so the cat should've remained inside.", "This is factually incorrect.

Mildly figurative rather than literal but English is 100% that way about things anyway. We can noun verbs, verb nouns, and use fuck to mean dozens of things.

And after deciding what best fit HIS cat, you go behind his back. You want him to apologize, but do you not feel bad at all that he was so worried and you caused that?.
