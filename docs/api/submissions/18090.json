I confronted him immediately and harshly, calling him a troubled teenager and said that our parents had been too forgiving of him despite his actions. This direct discussion might be perceived as being overly confrontational, potentially widening the gap between us, escalating his sense of loneliness, and fostering his animosity toward our parents and the family as a whole. I might also come across as insensitive if I don't take into account the psychological and emotional toll that Caleb would have taken from living under such strict regulations, especially in light of Joanna and my more lax upbringing.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If son didn't want to accept those restrictions he could have refused their financial help. Are those restrictions harsh? Absolutely. But this boy had a habit of running away, getting arrested, stealing his parents car, etc. Those restrictions kept him from falling back into those behaviors.

At the very least your parents were coercive and denied him normal experiences. He should be allowed to resent them. You don't have to want to hear about it but that this treatment was good, deserved, helpful, or proportionate is not \"the truth,\" just the opinion of someone from a household that normalises abusive behaviours.\n\nIt's also very likely you've flipped the order on several instances of cause and effect. His grades didn't necessarily dip because he was angry and comparing himself to his siblings; he was comparing himself to his siblings when he couldn't keep up and was being punished for it. \n\nIt's also perfectly possible to engage in an abusive behaviour with fewer than all your children.

Yes. \nBased on his past behavior, they created those conditions in order to continue supporting him through college, and based on the results, it worked. \nHe accepted the conditions to continue getting their support too. He can dislike it. You can give your POV, and he's allowed to dislike that too. \n\nIt's the reality that once you are a legal adult, your parents are no longer legally responsible to support you.

Seems like your parents were strict out of concern/they wanted the best for your brother.", "NTA. Your parents kept him out of JAIL!!! I mean - wow.", "NTA\n\nThis was more than normal teen issues. Bailing out of jail multiple times? Not normal. \n\nThose were the rules to stay in the house and for free money for college. He could have left and been on his own if he hated it that much.  He has free will on all of this. Free will to fuck up like he did and free will to not participate in the family. Just complaining all the time, like okay, go to therapy and get it worked out. \n\nHe is 24 and still lives at home.

If he truly hated it, he is freeeeeee to leave as his parents already said.", "NTA\u2026if he would have continued down the path he was taking, he could have ended up in prison or dead.  Honesty may be harsh, but always the best policy.  The parents were out a lot of time, worry, and Money for Caleb than his siblings.", "I'm on the fence. Some of the rules I can be on board with cause they were supporting him, but some of these rules are wayyyyy to controlling. \n\nWhile he may have done some bad shit as a teen, he still deserves to have good experiences in college. I can understand the curfew one, the drugs and alcohol one, studying in the hometown, and maybe not to move out(though that means he misses out on living on his own). \n\nThe ones I don't agree with are the clubs one, the GPS one, the driver's license one,  the interned one, the job one, and the vacation one. \n\nNow I'll tell you why the latter I don't approve. One, he's an adult. He should be able to pick his interests on clubs and interns and jobs. He's not a child. Your parents put him in a box that he's gonna suffocate in cause he has zero choices. I can't imagine going to college and my parents telling me what I can and cannot join and what job I can and cannot have. Like I could understand...hey, stay away from jobs that sell alcohol cause you don't want him in that environment but other than that I don't get it. The GPS is absolutely violating. They don't need to know where he is as an adult every single second of the day. I could understand if it was a safety thing...like hey, can we add you to life360 so just in case we don't hear from you in a couple days we can track you so you haven't been kidnapped. But that would be his choice. Not theirs. The driver's license got me the most. This kid had no where to run. If he decided he wanted to go to a friend's house, he can't drive. Or he wanted to go out and eat, he can't go. He's a damn adult. Ofcourse just having a driver's license doesn't mean he'd drive your parents car. He'd have to get his own. But to deny him that was making sure to absolutely control him. And finally, the vacation one.  He could never go on a vacation with his friends as an adult. Bro had zero life. I'd be dead inside after 4 years cause I wouldn't be able to go anywhere with my friends. \n\nYou see, you got to enjoy your college years. Your brother is going to look back on his college years as a total negative experience where his family controlled every thing he did. So, what you said to him was an asshole move. He's hurt for a reason. He did all this shit as a kid. And now that's he's grown up. He's angry and resentful. Now, you probably are going to get an even worse version of him. If he had done dumb shit as an adult, it would be on him. But, now the family is partly to blame because they reigned him in like animal and made sure he had no way to experience freedom. You know what that does to an animal? Makes them turn on their masters. Makes them build enough rage that once the cage is open, there's a whole rampage. Your brother may have mental problems like BPD, and I do feel for you, but I also feel you guys as a family made it worse. \n\nNow, as for him getting an apartment and not being able to control his temper....I do wonder why. Probably that taste of freedom he can't handle after being stuck in a box for his young adult life. But, still, he'll need therapy to unbox all that resentment. He won't need just therapy for his BPD but also for the resentment he carries of being controlled to that extent as an adult. I hope he's able to mellow out and take control of his life. I think he does need to get away from you other two kids so he doesn't compare his life to yours. And maybe even time away from his parents too. \n\nYou said your parents never compared you but your teachers may have. In the end, somewhere your brother had people comparing you two and him and that can do alot to your mental health. I wouldn't even be surprised that he acted out to see if his parents still loved him enough, even though he was wrong to do it.", "NTA. He is probably alive today because of all those restrictions. Sounds like he\u2019s TA.", "YTA.", "NTA... his parents were able to correct his behavior long enough to get him through university.  The rules sound strict but that is a result of what put him behind bars. He has been given an extraordinary gift of a good start in life. He can choose what road he wants to take from this point on.", "YTA.\n\nControl can be abusive, and it sounds like this is.  It's obscene to expect the person being abused to enjoy it.  Yes, he's choosing to be surveilled, because the math works out to a net positive for him.  And he'll probably drift away when it's done, because any strong relationships with him will have been poisoned by your parents, and your own involvement in that isolation will likely mean that it's permanent.\n\nMaybe Caleb will continue to hang around, hoping for some affection, grateful for any crumb that drops his way, even knowing that he'll be abused for the rest of his life, by the one group of people who should be on his side.", "If you\u2019re not omitting important details, NTA. He didn\u2019t have to suffer from his parents\u2019 rules, if he decided to pay his own way through school or chose to go to a cheaper trade school. \nOne\u2019s mental health struggles aren\u2019t a free pass to do whatever you want. Plus, according to OP, the family got tried therapy.", "NTA.  He screwed around and got caught, then repeatedly bailed out, then offered a proposal while a university student, presumably over the age of 18, who chose to live under that regime rather than go it alone as the adult he was.", "I suspect he always acted childish.   So his parents bailed him out numerous times, locked him down to finish college - that they paid for.   I suspect that they fed and housed him too.  Oh, and took him on vacation.  If he was truly resentful of the restrictions he could have left school and home.  Oh,, but then he would have to feed, house and clothe himself.   And now that he has graduated?   What is he doing?   Getting a job and finding a place of his own where he can do as he wishes?   I believe he is still living with mom and dad.\n\nI told my kids if they ever got arrested not to call me.  They did an adult crime, they could be the adult and figure it out.   They took me at my word, didn\u2019t ever get arrested, and then made friends with a bail bondsman.", "The OP also thinks that if you have mental health problems or cancer, that it's your own fault.", "Yeah, just going out into the world with serious mental health issues and absolutely no support is totally a workable option, a real plan for success there!", "No, that's just what the OP says without evidence. In the real world, most folks apply to tons of jobs without getting calls for all sorts of arbitrary reasons.", "No, his actions give you and your parents the excuse to enforce arbitrary \"consequences\". That's all this is, you and the rest of your family absolutely relish treating him like complete garbage.", "If they wanted to retire already they should have allowed him to learn how to be an adult while he was studying instead of being controlling assholes", "Oh noes, it wasn't fun for you? No one forced you to treat him like a prisoner.", "This. When I heard BPD I was like\u2026. There is def more to this story.", "Wait wait wait. You have THREE extended family members with personality disorders, the kind that often lead to the person inflicting abuse or trauma on others, and you *know for a fact* there\u2019s no trauma in Caleb\u2019s life? I seriously doubt it. Hello, your brother is the only male child, so if your uncle or cousin was ~friendly~ with boys, you and your sister wouldn\u2019t have been affected. Or maybe something happened because he was the youngest. Or the smallest. Or wrong place, wrong time. Unless you stayed velcroed to him at all moments of his childhood (including infancy), *you don\u2019t know.*\n\nNever mind the fact that with Borderline, *his thought processes and emotions work differently than yours.* He\u2019s not choosing to be \u201cdifficult\u201d, his emotions are far, far bigger than yours and his brain tries to tell him extreme things all the time. His brain has little to no understanding of \u201cshades of gray\u201d, his world is black and white. If you think it\u2019s exhausting for you, imagine being the one who has to live in his head.", "Needing approval to join clubs or take on internships? Only being allowed to study in their town? Requiring constant GPS tracking? \n\nWhat in the actual fuck?", "You aren't actually trying. You just enjoy being one of the golden children and the special treatment that comes with. \n\nI had a younger brother that was on the wild side. He's now a perfectly responsible adult with a job, house, wife and incredible children. He just had to find his own way. Who the heck are you to define your younger brother's life for him?", "This is really insane. Maybe let your kids actually grow up without resorting to financial abuse.", "> he tried to resist to his founders\n\nWhat does this mean?", "Your comment(s) violate [rule 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index#wiki_3._accept_your_judgement).

I still hold that little brother is an AH, but from your attitude to him, you are also an AH.", "YTA and so we\u2019re your parents. How was he ever going to gain independence? I get being strict to start but these rules were over the top. You were rude. You can\u2019t judge him you never experienced his pain. Clearly as a teen he had issues but being that strict you\u2019re lucky he didn\u2019t go off the deep end.", "No", "NTA. He was lucky they continued to support him and pay for his education. He chose to accept the restrictions. He could have moved out at any time and paid for his own life. He did not want to hear the truth. Edited for typo", "OK, but Caleb literally had to be bailed out of police stations? If your kid winds up in the police station *multiple times* then you probably should keep an eye on him.", "Extreme and controlling? He easily could have said, nope, not gonna do it. But he didnt. He agreed to their rules. Completely his choice. He also could have changed his ways before it got to that point. Again, he didnt. Completely his choice. Extreme and controlling... get real. \n\nOp, NTA. At all", "OP chose to include a pretty major detail of the kid having BPD which opens the door to this situation being FAR more complex then it comes across as. OP in the comments has been a bit all over the place so I\u2019d recommend at least reading some of that.", "100% agree. The kid was going to go to juvie and that can ruin your life. OPs parents had to take a hard Knox approach so that little bro can at least make something out of his other than flipping burgers. Just saying he needs college cause in this day and age education helps more with jobs than anything. I say NTA.", "That explains it.", "OP, NTA. And most of the Reddit champions here are still in their teens. If your parents hadn\u2019t put these rules, he would be in a far worse place.", "How long are you going to hold the past over him? Hasn\u2019t he paid enough? Don\u2019t you think the parents were toxic with their rules?", "Don\u2019t ya think that\u2019s a bit extreme? He\u2019s an adult. That\u2019s financial abuse", "Why doesn't he just go no contact with all of you? You clearly don't like him and he doesn't like anybody you.", "We can assume that because the parents imposed these harsh restrictions before he entered university. If he had done something during university that earned him a criminal record, I assume they would've kicked him out.", "They should have kicked him out at 18. He would be free to do as he pleases and no abuse. Pretty sure he would have been in a far worse place by now.", "Have you ever validated him? Your parents went overboard have you ever said that to him? Ever?", "Man you really hate this kid", "I get what you mean and I agree with your second paragraph, but OP is also male", "Man he must have had some terrible parents", "But then the parents would be assholes  because \"parenting doesn't end at 18\"", "That is so fucking wrong. How does a 2 yr old fuck up so bad that they get cancer?
