This direct discussion might be perceived as being overly confrontational, potentially widening the gap between us, escalating his sense of loneliness, and fostering his animosity toward our parents and the family as a whole. I might also come across as insensitive if I don't take into account the psychological and emotional toll that Caleb would have taken from living under such strict regulations, especially in light of Joanna and my more lax upbringing.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If son didn't want to accept those restrictions he could have refused their financial help. Are those restrictions harsh? Absolutely. But this boy had a habit of running away, getting arrested, stealing his parents car, etc. Those restrictions kept him from falling back into those behaviors.

At the very least your parents were coercive and denied him normal experiences. He should be allowed to resent them. You don't have to want to hear about it but that this treatment was good, deserved, helpful, or proportionate is not \"the truth,\" just the opinion of someone from a household that normalises abusive behaviours.\n\nIt's also very likely you've flipped the order on several instances of cause and effect. His grades didn't necessarily dip because he was angry and comparing himself to his siblings; he was comparing himself to his siblings when he couldn't keep up and was being punished for it. \n\nIt's also perfectly possible to engage in an abusive behaviour with fewer than all your children.

Yes. \nBased on his past behavior, they created those conditions in order to continue supporting him through college, and based on the results, it worked. \nHe accepted the conditions to continue getting their support too. He can dislike it. You can give your POV, and he's allowed to dislike that too. \n\nIt's the reality that once you are a legal adult, your parents are no longer legally responsible to support you.

Bailing out of jail multiple times? Not normal. \n\nThose were the rules to stay in the house and for free money for college. He could have left and been on his own if he hated it that much.  He has free will on all of this. Free will to fuck up like he did and free will to not participate in the family. Just complaining all the time, like okay, go to therapy and get it worked out. \n\nHe is 24 and still lives at home.

If he truly hated it, he is freeeeeee to leave as his parents already said.", "NTA\u2026if he would have continued down the path he was taking, he could have ended up in prison or dead.  Honesty may be harsh, but always the best policy.  The parents were out a lot of time, worry, and Money for Caleb than his siblings.", "I'm on the fence. Some of the rules I can be on board with cause they were supporting him, but some of these rules are wayyyyy to controlling. \n\nWhile he may have done some bad shit as a teen, he still deserves to have good experiences in college. I can understand the curfew one, the drugs and alcohol one, studying in the hometown, and maybe not to move out(though that means he misses out on living on his own). \n\nThe ones I don't agree with are the clubs one, the GPS one, the driver's license one,  the interned one, the job one, and the vacation one. \n\nNow I'll tell you why the latter I don't approve. One, he's an adult. He should be able to pick his interests on clubs and interns and jobs. He's not a child. Your parents put him in a box that he's gonna suffocate in cause he has zero choices. I can't imagine going to college and my parents telling me what I can and cannot join and what job I can and cannot have. Like I could understand...hey, stay away from jobs that sell alcohol cause you don't want him in that environment but other than that I don't get it. The GPS is absolutely violating. They don't need to know where he is as an adult every single second of the day. I could understand if it was a safety thing...like hey, can we add you to life360 so just in case we don't hear from you in a couple days we can track you so you haven't been kidnapped. But that would be his choice. Not theirs. The driver's license got me the most. This kid had no where to run. If he decided he wanted to go to a friend's house, he can't drive. Or he wanted to go out and eat, he can't go. He's a damn adult. Ofcourse just having a driver's license doesn't mean he'd drive your parents car. He'd have to get his own. But to deny him that was making sure to absolutely control him. And finally, the vacation one.  He could never go on a vacation with his friends as an adult. Bro had zero life. I'd be dead inside after 4 years cause I wouldn't be able to go anywhere with my friends. \n\nYou see, you got to enjoy your college years. Your brother is going to look back on his college years as a total negative experience where his family controlled every thing he did. So, what you said to him was an asshole move. He's hurt for a reason. He did all this shit as a kid. And now that's he's grown up. He's angry and resentful. Now, you probably are going to get an even worse version of him. If he had done dumb shit as an adult, it would be on him. But, now the family is partly to blame because they reigned him in like animal and made sure he had no way to experience freedom. You know what that does to an animal? Makes them turn on their masters. Makes them build enough rage that once the cage is open, there's a whole rampage. Your brother may have mental problems like BPD, and I do feel for you, but I also feel you guys as a family made it worse. \n\nNow, as for him getting an apartment and not being able to control his temper....I do wonder why. Probably that taste of freedom he can't handle after being stuck in a box for his young adult life. But, still, he'll need therapy to unbox all that resentment. He won't need just therapy for his BPD but also for the resentment he carries of being controlled to that extent as an adult. I hope he's able to mellow out and take control of his life. I think he does need to get away from you other two kids so he doesn't compare his life to yours. And maybe even time away from his parents too. \n\nYou said your parents never compared you but your teachers may have. In the end, somewhere your brother had people comparing you two and him and that can do alot to your mental health. I wouldn't even be surprised that he acted out to see if his parents still loved him enough, even though he was wrong to do it.", "NTA. He is probably alive today because of all those restrictions.

He can choose what road he wants to take from this point on.", "YTA.\n\nControl can be abusive, and it sounds like this is.  It's obscene to expect the person being abused to enjoy it.

You can\u2019t even put yourself in his shoes long enough to have an empathetic conversation. \n\nLastly, it\u2019s probably true that the overbearing rules kept him at university and got him a degree, but they did more harm than good because it wasn\u2019t executed well and was suffocating. So yeah, you and your parents can clap that he \u201cgot on the right path bc of the rules\u201d, but that\u2019s all you can clap about for yourselves.", "Might your brother be bipolar? He stayed having issues in his teens, tend to be impulsive, admits he can't handle money... That all sounds like mania. I'm not sure if he also has depressive spikes because this is just a small window into his life, but it sounds like he has something actually wrong with him. \n\n(No judgement, I'm bipolar and there are certain things we make sure I can't access it if I go manic)", "Bipolar here, type II. I agree it sounds like it, but it could also be another mental illness. It's nothing uncommon. But then I get the parents won't take him to the psychiatrists for diagnosis, because that would be just another flaw...", "1. the terms are abusive for a kid that hasn't been arrested multiple times, they are merely somewhat overboard in this case.  Actions have consequences, this is his parents putting their foot down after bailing him out of jail multiple times.  Honestly it's what he needs along with mental health help.\n2. Honestly, this is supporting him, they are forcing him out of a downward spiral.  Or would you rather have the kid continue behaving the way he was?", "Haha omg YTA and I\u2019m surprised you even have to ask. It\u2019s extremely controlling to gps track your adult son!", "Why are your parents changing the goalposts? He wasn't meant to get a driving licence until graduation which he has now done? So can he still not apply for one?\n\nI can understand why your parents acted but they basically put him in probation/prison for three years and continue to apply rules in exchange for giving him money . He tried to run away once so they tagged him so they could \"arrest' him again. Hate to break it to your parents but he has been an adult for 6 years and now he has graduated,their monetary hold is a lot less. \n\nWhat happened to cause him to rebel? What made him jealous of you? Lot of missing reasons here. Also you are not a co-parent or did you try to be?", "Those rules may be harsh but Caleb made his own choice to stay and receive his parent's financial support.", "In some places, that goes out the window if they commit another crime within a certain amount of time after turning 18.\n\n\nWhere I live, that time frame is usually considered to be within 3 to 5 years. If he messed up again at 20 here, those juvenile records would stick.", "I\u2019m sorry but this is outrageous. He made some mistakes and your parents will never let him forget it. He is an ADULT MAN, how will he ever learn to be independent if he has a family like this who expect him to fail and control his every mood. Is he even allowed to shit on his own schedule? My goodness YTA and your parents are abusive awful AH too", "If you're interested enough to comment on a post, you should make it a habit to check the Op's account. For history and their responses (if any). Especially on this subreddit. People wildly changed their tunes when shit isn't going their way, and don't update for obvious reasons.\n\n\nIt's almost hilarious truthfully. People will post a one-sided story, get some hate and then shot themselves in the foot with a sloppy defense. Such as this Op has done."]}
