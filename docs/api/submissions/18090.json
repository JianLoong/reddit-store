I confronted him immediately and harshly, calling him a troubled teenager and said that our parents had been too forgiving of him despite his actions. This direct discussion might be perceived as being overly confrontational, potentially widening the gap between us, escalating his sense of loneliness, and fostering his animosity toward our parents and the family as a whole. I might also come across as insensitive if I don't take into account the psychological and emotional toll that Caleb would have taken from living under such strict regulations, especially in light of Joanna and my more lax upbringing.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Seeing his behavior issues and them being like \u201coh you should be more like your siblings\u201d and other things like that can really get to someone, especially if they already feel like the black sheep\n\nIf he is neurodivergent it is very possible he has rejection sensitivity as part of that and feels markedly different from you and your sister. He \u201cjust can\u2019t get it right\u201d and that alienated him more and more\n\nThe police issues and running away from home, yes, he does have to take accountability for that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying ESH instead of YTA\n\nHowever, I will say, your parents\u2019 restrictions on your ADULT brother are absolutely toxic a f. TRACKING him is the main one that\u2019s the worst. Tracking your kids in order to control them is abusive. Especially since he was literally an adult. So you were definitely WAY out of line trying to tell him that was perfectly ok", "YTA\n\nThe way you talk about your brother is very patronizing, and I don't doubt that it comes out in the way you talk to him.\n\nThose are some very extreme \"conditions\". Excluding everything about him having a mental health disorder, a very mentally unhealthy environment, and the absolute lack of information about what he actually did wrong (how old was he when he ran away? what did he end up doing to end up in a juvenile prison?), your parents abused him by tying their support - financial and emotional - to absolute control over his life. \n\nYou defended them and their abuse. You told him that he not only deserved to be treated like that, but he deserved less than what he got and to be fully abandoned. You are an asshole, and a terrible brother.", "Jesus Christ, those rules are INSANE. GPS tracking? No driver\u2019s license? \n\n\nYTA and so are your parents. There\u2019s something called over correcting and that\u2019s what your parents did. Your brother has a right to his frustrations. You didn\u2019t live his life. Your experience with your parents is not his experience with those same parents. I\u2019m honestly surprised he hasn\u2019t gone NC with them because after that crap, you\u2019d be lucky if you ever saw me again.", "YTA, your comments sealed the deal here, if you don't even like your brother just leave him alone. Those rules were and are absurd no wonder he acts childish you all treated him like a child through college.", "YTA. The conditions they put on him were extreme and controlling, and he has a right to feel resentful.

Js.", "Your parents solved the problem of bailing out their son over and over, and it worked.  He could've walked away whenever he wanted. Eviction and him earning his own way were always a solution. He opted for choice one, which came with strings that he forced upon himself. NTA, if he didn't like it, he could've left, and for all the people saying his feelings were invalidated, op simply gave their opinion on how they would've dealt with it.", "From reading in the comments, I see he has trouble getting jobs due to his record. Normally, I'd say they went too far but with that extra bit of information? Yeah, Caleb needed a firmer hand. NTA", "YTA.\n\nIn no way were those restrictions generous, lol. I'd even go so far as to call them draconian.", "NTA\nThose rules your parents imposed, while strict, were probably the only way he was going to graduate.  Had I been arrested numerous times, there's no way my parents would waste money on sending me to school.\n\nAt the end of the day, your brother made his choice.  The options were follow the strict rules and get a degree, or move out and play the game of life on hard mode by himself.  He chose what he chose.  He has no one to blame but himself.", "Ah, the classic narcissistic parents, golden children, and scapegoat dynamic. Your poor brother. I pity him being stuck with a family of jackals who clearly don't give a rats ass about him.", "NTA\nAct like an AH, get treated like one.\nHe's lucky he got so much help.\nGet ready with your answers for when your parents can't bail him out anymore...", "YTA. You and your asshole parents are way too controlling. And you're an even bigger asshole for insisting that people with cancer have f--- up. That right there shows how selfish and ignorant you are.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nAnyone that agrees that Caleb deserved that kind of treatment deserves to stub their toes and step on lego.\n\nThe punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime and your controlling parents went extremely overboard with their punishment. \n\nI hope he goes NC with you, Joanna, your parents, and anyone that sides with you.

I blame his teachers for comparison because they were also our teachers and I was a salutatorian and Joanna was a valedictorian.

I found out over time that I have undiagnosed autism and that was a huge factor into understanding why I felt different from other people and compared myself to other people from such a young age\n\nIt is very possible that he has some sort of undiagnosed thing (like autism or adhd) that went unnoticed by his caretakers and a lack of support and understanding led him to have trauma which led to BPD\n\nAlso, honestly, I don\u2019t have the full picture of your family dynamics so I can\u2019t say for sure that your \u201cstrict\u201d upbringing was not abusive and you\u2019re just denying that because some things were normalized that shouldn\u2019t have been\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t know that abuse is abuse until they reach early adulthood and realize what is and isn\u2019t ok", "Most probably no. My parents found his current job because when people do background checks on him, they see the stuff they have done so he doesn't get called to the interviews most of the time.

It is a really shitty situation", ">It\u2019s not a case of the parents being overly controlling as evidenced by the siblings upbringing.\n\nWe don't know that. The parents were permissive with the well-behaved kids, but when it came time to deal with the troublemaker who needed a firmer hand, they went overboard. That's my take at least, I don't think you can look at the experience of the older two and draw conclusions about the fairness of the treatment of the younger one.", "Ah, the favoritism is slowly revealing itself.\n\nHow often did you and Johanna talk about all the cool things you could do and your parents telling him he wasn't as good as you two for years?", "If you pity him, then maybe have a heart and let him vent about his frustration - even if you think he's off-base.

We grew up with \"Homework first, fun second\" but we also knew to take care of our mental health. I am queer and I was having anxiety attacks about being outed and they got me help, found parent support groups for themselves, they let me take \"mental health\" days but they always made us felt they were our parents.

What the hell are you talking about?\n\n How is being born with a mental illness different from that? Sure, he fucked up. He should have known better in many regards. You come off as callous and cruel though. Not everyone gets cancer from smoking and the like.
