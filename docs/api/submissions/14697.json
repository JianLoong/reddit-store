Didn\u2019t care when it was happening to her son but oh it\u2019s the end of the world when it happened to her! Good for you!! Hold your head up high and keep looking after your husband.", "NTA. You gave her a receipt that was a long time coming.", "NTA. \n\nHis mother enabled that behaviour towards your husband, and neglected him when she was supposed to protect him. \n\nIt pains me when I see parents like this who seriously take the word of the person they\u2019re seeing over their own children\u2019s, without realizing the kind of damage that does. \n\nShe\u2019s only showing up now in hysterics because she\u2019s facing the consequences of her failure to listen and act.", "NTA. My wedding. My MIL bawling and saying she was so sorry she let him(stepdad) beat my husband. Could you have handled it differently?  Sure. But what you did was primal and rightfully protective. Now. Ask what your husband needs. I learned that no matter how terrible a parent treats a child, that now grown child still craves the approval from that parent. It was difficult for me to understand. Find out what he needs. That\u2019s what matters now.", "NTA you\u2019re a FUCKING QUEEN!!!", "Gold star. It's easy to be sorry when you need something. Let her sort her shit out, be in a reasonably good place, and then come knocking with nothing but the honest intention to apologize and make her regrets known. Everything else is just the same abusive gaslighting shit that your hubby ran away from.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA. I hate it when these MIL who treat their kids like shit for a man and then come running when the man...wait for it...treats them like shit. OP,  you are awesome. Glad you stood up to her.", "NTA This woman allowed her husband to terribly abuse her child and wouldn't help him. He was forced to leave home and cut off contact with her for his own well being. Now she's had the nerve to show up at her son's door begging for help. I would have done the same thing. She was given a beautiful child and she chose not to protect him. Now she can suffer the consequences.", "NTA\n\nLook where you're husband is. And that's just from her coming to the door. Imagine how bad it would be if she came in?\n\nYou don't owe her help or compassion. She had none for your husband. There's no way she didn't know what her husband was like. She just decided it wasn't a problem. She decided it was acceptable because it didn't hurt her. It's suddenly important because it hurt her and she instantly wants it to go away. Your husband didn't have that luxury.\n\nMore than that, her husband left. She's not in danger. Nothing more will happen to her except she will have to clean her house and cry through her divorce. She hasn't had anyone for years, it's too bad that it is a problem now. \n\nMaybe some day there will be some sort of healing, but she's going to have to work for that. She's going to have to earn it.", "NTA. You defended your family's interest as you should.", "NTA. Hubby is very lucky to have you.", "He had a PANIC ATTACK just of the sight of her being close to him. An abuser enabler! Do people really think he want to reconnect with someone who he asked for help and didn't believe him? She can live with the guilty and whatever she's dealing now. The son was severely neglected and abused, major of his problems are her and her lovely abuser ex husband. NTA, we do what we do to protect who we love and when a threat to this person peace is happening we use everything to keep them away. *What if he wants to reconnect with his mom?* BS. NTA OP, good for him to have you, I hope he will be okay with time. Best of luck to never see this woman again.", "NTA\n\nIt continues to stagger me how many parents never consider the fact that their kids will grow up, realise how awful they are and want nothing to do with them. Do they think kids just forget about abuse?", "NTA. Ooooh man I bet that felt good in the moment, though. Please update after you talk to your husband. How does he feel about what you said? I think that will help clarify things.", "NTA.\n\nShe's finding the consequences for her behavior aren't enjoyable.", "NTA. This internet stranger is very proud of you!!! Good job! You have nothing to feel bad about.", "She needed to hear it. Self-punishment doesn't help get you on track. Self-punishment takes away from others their right to hold you accountable. If she never showed up to hear this, it would backfire on her in spectacular fashion down the road when she decides she's become a better person who is deserving of forgiveness, only to be told to go to hell. \n\nIn your slapping her with the truth, she now knows you both haven't forgiven her. She now *understands* how hated she is. Now, if it actually matters to her, she can work to try and earn forgiveness. \n\nTo be clear, she's not entitled to it by any stretch of the imagination, and if the abuse was sexual in any way, she doesn't deserve it.\n\nThis is coming from a man who divorced his egg donor, looks forward to the call informing me she's dead, and who will absolutely not be attending any funeral for her.", "Nta", "NTA \n\nGood for you!!", "NTA- it's one thing to not listen to an apology- quite another for it to be more like - let me live you I swear I'm sorry. Nah lady. Peace", "NTA. you were fiercely protective of your husband, and it sounds like it's about time someone was. good for you.", "NTA.  The reason you feel bad is that you are a decent human being who has empathy.\n\nYour outrage is from the years of abuse your husband was subjected to that she turned a blind eye to.  Now that her house is trashed and she's alone, she needs her son. \n\nTruly remorseful people would have apologized profusely and then left without asking for anything.  So, she didn't show up at your house for her son, but for your house and security because now she has nothing.  Hope your husband feels better.", "NTA. Manipulators think tears work on everyone and are shocked when they don\u2019t. I love your shiny spine! You did the right thing and I\u2019m sure your husband appreciates it. Take care of yourselves and keep the old bat blocked. She deserves nothing.", "NTA - but in all honesty that should have come from your husband. It might have actually been healing for him to be vindicated and to tell his mother to leave. Regardless mom got the comeuppance she was entitled to receive but it\u2019s up to your husband to move on and not look back or to try and repair the relationship. From what you said, I\u2019d just move on and not look back.", "NAH. You didn't make anything worse. (Heck arguable having someone who loves him actually stand up for him is beneficial) If she was coming to seek forgiveness, husband can reach out if he decides he wants to hear her.", "INFO because I get why you would defend your husband - it\u2019s an understandable response. But your defending him has taken his agency away to a degree.  He\u2019s vulnerable to this kind of conflict that he likely saw a lot with her, and you went hard with his mother, and whether or not she deserves your anger, it might have been very painful for him to be back around that sort of emotional violence.  Why didn\u2019t he answer the door or come out to talk or whatever?  I mean, I can understand why he wouldn\u2019t want to see her but it seems like more detail about his feelings is needed. If he\u2019s depressed and withdrawn there are likely many reasons for that.  \n\nAlso, maybe you regret going off on her, upsetting her etc.  Maybe you think she was likely a victim too in spite of her not doing the right thing, and maybe she did her best with what she knew how to do; and after your expression of how mad you are on your husband\u2019s behalf maybe you are wondering if that could have gone better.  I think it would be wrong to judge you entirely based on this one event, but consider that you seem unafraid to get loud (not a bad thing at all in and of itself) and your husband seems to be more one to avoid conflict at this point.  Maybe he\u2019s had it in his mind that he wants to fix this, and that if she admits she was wrong in a real and good way that helps him, he gets his mom back - and lots of folks on Reddit like to tell people to cut other out of their life, which might be fun to say recreationally but is a very extreme measure.  If she had been the abuser (and it\u2019s not worth characterizing her as an abuser by proxy merely because she didn\u2019t put an end to the problem with the stepdad) that would be different, but she was cowed and her self-esteem was pretty low to stay with him.  She lost her first husband, and that does things to people, especially people who were raised a certain way - maybe she felt her future was destroyed and she needed to get back to the safety of a husband caretaker because that\u2019s what she\u2019d been told all her life.  Not excusing it at all, because not everyone chooses that even if they were raised that way, but it\u2019s often the reality, and an important detail to know when looking at the overall.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if she is just running to another male figure or if she is truly regretful about how she dealt with her son. And it seems like your actions may have made it harder for that conversation to take place - I understand your feelings about it but you inserted yourself as an incendiary influence on the situation.  An alternative would have been to hold on to your anger on his behalf until you found out what his intentions were, because he\u2019s a grown man.  Holding your tongue (which takes Herculean strength) doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t support him or you aren\u2019t loyal to him; but he\u2019s not made of glass.  Seems like he needs to deal or let you know he can\u2019t or won\u2019t, and then you can address that together.  \n\nGood luck.", "YTA:  What if your husband wanted to help his mom? What if he wanted to reconnect?  \n\nYou yelling and sending her away possibly took away this possibility. Like you said you don't know the whole story so why would you make the decision on his behalf.  Even if he agrees you should have let him decide", "I understand you being protective of your hubby, and actually applaud your passion. You are NOT an asshole\u2026.. BUT\u2026. This needs to be between the two of them. As you said, you weren\u2019t there. Don\u2019t know all the context. Let your hubby figure out what he wants, and then support whatever that is just as passionately\u2026 even if it\u2019s reconnecting the two.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
