She now *understands* how hated she is.

It might have actually been healing for him to be vindicated and to tell his mother to leave. Regardless mom got the comeuppance she was entitled to receive but it\u2019s up to your husband to move on and not look back or to try and repair the relationship. From what you said, I\u2019d just move on and not look back.", "NAH. You didn't make anything worse. (Heck arguable having someone who loves him actually stand up for him is beneficial) If she was coming to seek forgiveness, husband can reach out if he decides he wants to hear her.", "INFO because I get why you would defend your husband - it\u2019s an understandable response. But your defending him has taken his agency away to a degree.  He\u2019s vulnerable to this kind of conflict that he likely saw a lot with her, and you went hard with his mother, and whether or not she deserves your anger, it might have been very painful for him to be back around that sort of emotional violence.  Why didn\u2019t he answer the door or come out to talk or whatever?  I mean, I can understand why he wouldn\u2019t want to see her but it seems like more detail about his feelings is needed. If he\u2019s depressed and withdrawn there are likely many reasons for that.  \n\nAlso, maybe you regret going off on her, upsetting her etc.  Maybe you think she was likely a victim too in spite of her not doing the right thing, and maybe she did her best with what she knew how to do; and after your expression of how mad you are on your husband\u2019s behalf maybe you are wondering if that could have gone better.  I think it would be wrong to judge you entirely based on this one event, but consider that you seem unafraid to get loud (not a bad thing at all in and of itself) and your husband seems to be more one to avoid conflict at this point.  Maybe he\u2019s had it in his mind that he wants to fix this, and that if she admits she was wrong in a real and good way that helps him, he gets his mom back - and lots of folks on Reddit like to tell people to cut other out of their life, which might be fun to say recreationally but is a very extreme measure.  If she had been the abuser (and it\u2019s not worth characterizing her as an abuser by proxy merely because she didn\u2019t put an end to the problem with the stepdad) that would be different, but she was cowed and her self-esteem was pretty low to stay with him.  She lost her first husband, and that does things to people, especially people who were raised a certain way - maybe she felt her future was destroyed and she needed to get back to the safety of a husband caretaker because that\u2019s what she\u2019d been told all her life.  Not excusing it at all, because not everyone chooses that even if they were raised that way, but it\u2019s often the reality, and an important detail to know when looking at the overall.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if she is just running to another male figure or if she is truly regretful about how she dealt with her son. And it seems like your actions may have made it harder for that conversation to take place - I understand your feelings about it but you inserted yourself as an incendiary influence on the situation.  An alternative would have been to hold on to your anger on his behalf until you found out what his intentions were, because he\u2019s a grown man.  Holding your tongue (which takes Herculean strength) doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t support him or you aren\u2019t loyal to him; but he\u2019s not made of glass.  Seems like he needs to deal or let you know he can\u2019t or won\u2019t, and then you can address that together.  \n\nGood luck.", "YTA:  What if your husband wanted to help his mom? What if he wanted to reconnect?  \n\nYou yelling and sending her away possibly took away this possibility. Like you said you don't know the whole story so why would you make the decision on his behalf.  Even if he agrees you should have let him decide", "I understand you being protective of your hubby, and actually applaud your passion. You are NOT an asshole\u2026.. BUT\u2026.

It's not about how your husband suffered as a result of her choices.  It's not about respecting that she hurt him and won't make demands on him for what she wants, because she knows she lost that right years ago.  It's not about him at all.  All she throws out there for him is that she now realizes he was telling the truth.  So, she thought he was lying, all those years?

She didn't go out and get involved in things and make friends.  That's on her.\n\nThe current situation is the result of her behaviors and her choices.  **She tried to play you, to manipulate you, and to get you to join her Pity Party and become her new support system.** \n\n**All you did was protect your home and your Best Beloved from a person that allowed abuse for years.**  \n\n**All you did was tell her that her current situation is the consequences of her own choices.**   Could you have crafted out a polite speech that said the same thing?  Sure, if you had had advance warning of this emotional and verbal attack about to happen to you, and time enough to write out a rough draft, edit it, edit it again and then read it out.

Someone who when the shit hits the fan for him, I step in, tell people where to go, protect him, show him that even when he\u2019s got all of this internal conflict and fear and guilt warring inside him, he doesn\u2019t have to put it aside and make decisions - he can trust me to make the right ones to keep him safe.", "\u201cSin, young man, is when you treat people like things. Including yourself. That's what sin is.\u201d -Terry Pratchett", "My brain does something similar. The best way I can describe it is that I would feel guilty about standing up for myself unless I could dehumanize the person in front of me. It's like I would go from having endless patience and understanding to flipping into 'fuck around and find out' mode. My actions around those moments didn't really feel like choices as they did the inevitable consequences of other people's actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI couldn't really engage with the decision making or feel any real emotion about how awful I acted because I didn't feel like I was making a choice so much as resigning myself to accepting that the choice had already been made. I did some monstrous things that felt fully justified until later, when the shame of it would start to sink in. Then I would repress the anger even more and become more of a doormat until it would blow up harder. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt some point, the outbursts stopped being external and became panic attacks instead, but that feeling of having lines that once people cross them they abdicate their 'treated as humans privileges,' still persists sometimes. Thankfully, my body has broken down some as I've aged, so violence isn't really a viable outlet for me, anymore.", "There is a huge correlation between behavioral changes and head injuries. It can be traumatic hits like football or a car/workplace accident, or repeated smaller hits like soccer players heading a ball. It's scary how fragile your personality can be. You're still you, but you're not really you anymore. \n\nSam Kinison (American comedian from 80s/90s) gained his signature voice and attitude, after a head injury. Complete personality change.\n\nGary Busey is another. Motorcycle accident got him I believe, and he had a head injury that turned him from Point Break to Celebrity Rehab.\n\nEven myself. I've noticed a pereonality change after getting hit playing sports. Quick to anger, which normally isn't a go to, was noticeable. It's scary how easily you can change.", "I think it's an incredibly nuanced and multi-faceted issue, of course, and there will never be just one answer that fixes everything. But I definitely think that studying TBIs and future acts of violence is a thread worth pulling, to understand what causes some percentage of those acts."]}
