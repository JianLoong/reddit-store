Poor kid,", "NTA. Your SIL leverages her kids to get away with bad behavior. She lies and is delusional. I\u2019d milk as much time in your life to stay clear of her and her husband.", "NTA. So sorry your SIL invalidated you and your wives feelings about this loss. She sounds just awful. Wouldn\u2019t associate with them anymore for sure", "NTA. You don't accuse someone of faking a miscarriage and expect them to just carry on and be friendly. I mean, it's not surprising that your BIL is going to support his wife - I do feel bad that he's stuck in the middle - but he should understand you supporting your wife too. What a sick thing to accuse your own sister of...", "Nope.

Definitely NTA.", "[deleted]", "NTA and if she's this crazy you are better off. I can't imagine making some else's miscarriage about myself. I'm so sorry this is happening to you.", "NTA they should all be dead to you after what she did.", "What an utterly horrific accusation to make about you & your wife.\n\nYour SIL took a painful event that you experienced, (so sorry for your loss, btw..) and used it as a weapon against both of you. She accused you both of being cruel and deceptive, by stating that you faked the pregnancy and miscarriage, solely to hurt HER. \n\nAND- she's defaming you both to others with that narrative, in a place where you socialize. I can't tell if it's deliberate malice on your SIL's part, or if she's distorting reality to a huge degree. There isn't enough information about her to assign motive to her behavior. \n\nBut she IS assigning motive to you and your wife, which is unacceptable, and highly toxic. In addition to pouring salt in your wounds, she's claiming that your wounds aren't even real. This is a situation in which NC would be absolutely justified.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nGiven the circumstances and the hurtful actions of your sister-in-law, your decision to refuse to speak to her seems justified. It's clear that her behavior has caused you and your wife a great deal of pain, especially considering the sensitive nature of your miscarriage. It's understandable that you would be infuriated upon hearing the false accusations she made about your wife faking her pregnancy and miscarriage.\n\nYou've expressed your concerns to your in-laws, and they seem to understand the situation. It's important to prioritize your emotional well-being and protect yourself from further harm. Your wife supports your decision, and your father-in-law respects it as well.\n\nIt's essential for your sister-in-law to be held accountable for her actions, particularly when they cause distress to you and your family. By choosing not to engage with her until she apologizes, you are setting boundaries and making it clear that such behavior is unacceptable. It's not unreasonable to expect an apology and acknowledgment of the pain she has caused before attempting to rebuild the relationship.\n\nGaslighting occurs when someone manipulates or distorts the truth to make you doubt your own reality. From the information you've provided, it seems more likely that your sister-in-law is trying to deflect responsibility for her actions rather than gaslighting you. However, her accusations about how you treat her husband may be an attempt to create a narrative that paints you as the instigator. It's important to stay firm in your stance and prioritize your emotional well-being throughout this process.\n\nYour decision to distance yourself from your sister-in-law until she takes responsibility for her hurtful actions is a reasonable response to protect yourself and your wife.", "NTA", "Definitely being gaslit.

Unfortunately, there really isn't much you can do.  SIL is a total AH & it sounds like it's not just in this instance.  They owe you the mother of apologies for this one.  I would certainly go NC after this.", "NTA. Go No Contact with these pair.", "When you choose to stand so close to terrible people, don't be surprised when you all get painted with the same brush.\n\nIf I did something that horrible my husband would never support me in it.  My parents would be livid (though I could possibly see them letting things go to keep the grandkids).  Even if OP had said hi back it would not have sounded or felt genuine and that would have started the exact same issue.\n\nSide note:BIL is exactly as bad as SIL. He knows what the issue is, he tried to pretend nothing happened, it didn't work, and he ran and tattled.  He could have handled any of this like a grownup, but chose not to", "Nta. Sil threatens to go no contact if her parents don\u2019t take her side well you guys can go no contact with sil until they apologize, it goes both ways. :)"]}
