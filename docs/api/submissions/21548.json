It took us to some of the deepest depths of despair and sadness. In the aftermath, we received an outpouring of support from friends and family, and that really helped us through. \n\nEveryone was vocally supportive, everyone except for my wife\u2019s sister. She had suffered a miscarriage as well last year trying for their second child, and, in contrast to my wife and I, who were open about our struggle, she had dealt with hers very privately. \n\nSo when my SIL didn\u2019t reach out, I understood completely how challenging the experience might be, and how this could be a trigger for her.\n\nSo about a month goes by. My wife\u2019s recovering well physically and emotion and we begin moving on. \n\nAt this time my wife is at the golf club where our whole family plays. A woman that my wife and her sister both play with comes up to my wife an offers her condolences along with apologies that she doesn\u2019t agree with the SIL. \n\nMy wife asks what she means, and this woman says that my SIL had been telling the other women that my wife \u201cfaked her pregnancy and miscarriage to hurt her [SIL]\u201d, whatever that means.\n\nNow, I typically strive for stoicism, but hearing this infuriated me, and tore open the wounds that had just beginning to heal.\n\nWe shared what we had heard with my in-laws who were horrified, and confronted SIL but she didn\u2019t deny it or apologize. \n\nRather, she used family visitation with her son/their grandson/our nephew to force the in-laws to drop the subject (she threatens to cut off access often - her prerogative as a parent - but it means that she\u2019s not held accountable for treating others poorly)\n\nSo from that day, it\u2019s been about a month, I have opted to not speak to her, or my BIL who is enabling her, and will not until they apologize. \n\nOver the long weekend, I ran into my BIL, SIL\u2019s husband, at the club. He said \u201cHey\u201d and I ignored him and simply walked on by - which has led to fresh new accusations by SIL to my in-laws that I\u2019m an asshole and that I\u2019m treating her husband poorly.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m being gaslit by my SIL, but if I\u2019m being an asshole, I want to know. \n\nMy wife supports my decision, and while my FIL is disappointed to see the strife, he respects my decision.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1688698625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14suhux/aita_for_refusing_to_speak_to_my_sil/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do what you feel is right.", "NTA If you don\u2019t want to speak to your SIL until she says something more about it, I completely understand. It\u2019s sounds like you\u2019re a person who is not spiteful at all, but I will say anyway that just don\u2019t do or say anything mean or hurtful to her in revenge.
