Your brother and you are brothers for life. She\u2019s someone both of you have probably screwed and that\u2019s all weird.  Why on earth would she even want a relationship anywhere near her ex anyway.", "YTA for sure and disrespectful asf. Your going to lose your brother over this. I hope it's worth it.", "YTA you do realize this is how she is getting back at your brother more than likely . This isn\u2019t a \u201cwe are adults situation\u201d this is called being a shitty brother and an overall shitty person like sleeping with your best friends mom low", "YTA. This is the moment when your brother realizes that you CAN choose your own family after realizing the one provided for you is toxic.", "She\u2019s your brother\u2019s ex girlfriend for crying out loud.\n\nYTA", "Of course, YTA. Why would you even consider dating your brother's ex-girlfriend? That screams of a lack of respect for your brother and that you're not at all concerned with his feelings.", "YTA. But what I don\u2019t understand is - why were you hanging out with her at all? You said you felt guilty about it, but the more you got to know her, the stronger the connection was - but\u2026why did you \u2018get to know her\u2019 in the first place?\n\nUnless this crush is from when they were actually in a relationship?", "First sentence and I don\u2018t need to read any further. Excuse me, your brothers EX?? \nYTA, some things are just NEVER OK. I don\u2019t care if you \u201asaw her first\u2018, I don\u2019t care how it all went down. your brother was with her first and that makes her OFF LIMITS. Hands down YTA absofuckinglutely and SHE\u2019s a major disgusting asshole as well.", "100% YTA - and a completely sucky brother too!", "YTA. This is pretty messed up and disrespectful. They dated for 2 years and on,y broke up a few months ago. Your brother would never trust you now. There are millions of other women out there. How could you do this to your own brother", "I\u2019m not going to pass judgement here, my grandpa dated my grandma\u2019s older sister for a decent amount of time before they (my grandparents) got together & eloped. Might have some bias, here.", "Yta you don't do that to friends or family. The only way its remotely ok is after a few years and with the blessing of said family/friend", "Info: Did they end their relationship on good term and how many months is a few exactly?", "She can\u2019t have the brother so she\u2019ll settle for you instead. Think about that. YTA", "YTA\n\nAre you really that desperate for \u201csomething special\u201d that you\u2019d stoop low enough to date a siblings ex, and then fight them on it?\n\nYou and your sloppy seconds really need to learn some class.", "How old are you? WTH. You're oblivious.", "YTA- STRAIGHT UP BREAKING BLOODLINE BRO CODE.", "All I know is I would be absolutely livid if my sibling (or any close family member) did this to me. That relationship would be immediately damaged forever. Some things you just don't do..", "YTA \n\nMaybe, just maybe, she using you to get back at him. But hey you have something in common. Your both the AH.", "YTA YOU NEED INTENSE THERAPY OMG you deserve to have all contact cut off this is wild", ">I recently started dating my brother's ex-girlfriend. They had been together for two years and broke up a few months ago\n\nYTA, they were together TWO YEARS. Not only that, they just broke up a few months ago. If I were your brother I'd cut you out of my life entirely.", "YTA of the highest order.  You seriously came here to ask this? You knew the answer all along you scavenger", "INFO: what did brother warn you about her?", "YTA and probably the sucker too. They dated for 2 years and only ended it recently? Dude. She is dating you to hurt him. Congrats for being TA who fell for it.", "They dated for 2 years and broke up a few months ago.\n\nShe is with you so she can have access to your brother.\n\nYTA", ">I'm not sure if I'm being the asshole here, but I recently started dating my brother's ex-girlfriend.\n\nAfter reading the first sentence YTA...\n\nAfter reading the rest...\n\n\n\nYTA... Jesus...", "Yep YTA", "YTA. Yikes yikes yikes. This is so ick of you to do ew. The total disrespect and betrayal. OP to me you're a bottom of the barrel man right now I can't even think of a single situation where you can redeem yourself of this. Lord the face I made while reading what you wrote.", "YEP YTA. Just because you can. Doesn\u2019t mean you should OP. \n\nShe\u2019s with you to make your brother angry. You\u2019re her rebound. She probably wants to *cough compare the family jewels.  And discuss her findings with her friends! lol", "Tbh if I was your brother I don't think even dumping her would make me want to be around you again. Bffr. YTA", "Oh cummon, you already know YTA. And she isn\u2019t really into you and you know it. GTFO", "YTA- I thought it after I read the first sentence and confirmed it in the second. You don't date a siblings ex and sure as heck don't date them only a few months later AFTER a two year relationship. \n\nYou didn't list your age, so I'm hoping you're like 12 or something. That's the one way I can see you thinking this is okay.", "She dates him for over 2 years ,a few months post break up she's with you. And you happily going along with it. How did this happen?", "YTA. It's common knowledge that any close family member's ex is strictly *off limits*. Now you've put yourself in a position where you may have to choose between your brother and your gf.\n\nAlso,  they were together for 2 years and like, just broke up. Chances are you're a rebound and you're damaging the relationship with your brother for a fling. But even if that's not the case,  isn't it just a little weird that your brother's been inside your gf?? Not to be crass here, but I draw a hard line on dating anyone who's dated anyone within my immediate circle of influence for this very reason. Someone i don't know is hypothetical, I don't want to kiss my husband knowing his mouth was in my sister's vag.", "YTA.", "INFO: How did you start dating?", "YTA- and gross. Definitely gross.", "YTA, there are billions of people out there and you had to pick your brothers ex? Stop being lazy and go find someone else, or give up having a brother.", "No doubt. YTA. How would you feel if she leaves you to date your brother again? She slept with your brother for 2 years, you most probably met her through him, do you really not see the problem?\n\nAnd someone else point it out.. doesn\u2019t it feel weird to you that she still wants to be around your bother? I bet she is still not over him and doing ANYTHING to be near him", "YTA, without a doubt. Sure, you can date whoever you want, but that doesn\u2019t mean doing so won\u2019t make you a massive AH. There are things you just don\u2019t do because they\u2019re disrespectful and/or gross, and dating your brother\u2019s ex - particularly one from a serious, long term relationship - is at the top of that list. You are 100% in the wrong here.", "YTA \n\nYuck. \n\nWhat does your Mum think?\n\nIs she trying to punish your brother by using you?\n\nShe was shagging your brother only 5 minutes ago and now it\u2019s you! \n\nYeah dude! Yuck", "This feels fake\u2026 if real, YTA", "YTA, you can't be dense enough not to realize this would damage your relationship with your brother. You are choosing her over him here, just be sure that's what you want before pursuing this further.", "YTA, dude... At least wait a while longer... Isn't it awkward to you that your gf is involved in her ex`s life through being in a relationship with you?\n\nThere's this thing in most modern cultures that you don't date your friends' (or family's) exes, it's creepy and weird. In my country we call it \"abiding by the code\", you would have no code.", "YTAH\n\nHow could you do this to your brother? Does blood not mean anything to you? You and the girlfriend should both be ashamed. You for doing sloppy seconds and her because clearly your brother didn't mean anything to her if she is wilimg to jump into a relationship with you so quickly.", "YTA and a horrible brother. They were together for 2 YEARS, broke up few MONTHS ago and got with you, the BROTHER. And you see nothing wrong with this? If i were him i would, without a doubt, go NC with you. And the ex is just as bad. She wanted to stay so close to the ex that she's willing to hook up with the sibling\ud83d\ude02", "YTA. You\u2019re also her rebound. Get over yourself.", "YTA big time! Of all the women in this world, you just HAD to date your brother\u2019s ex. He is not being unreasonable at all. What in Hell\u2019s bells is wrong with you?!!? If you persist in your quest to disrespect your brother, you\u2019ll lose him. Something tells me that you had your eye on her long before this. Either way, I hope she\u2019s worth it. Not!", "YTA, the damage is already done.", "You\u2019re that hard up you have to go for your brothers ex? Just have a good little think about it. \n\nYTA. \n\nWhere do people come up with this crap?", "What the heck is wrong with you? Millions of women in the world and you go for your brother's ex? Seriously? You really want to be with someone your brother had sex with for 2 years? Really? YTA All the way through.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t see any wrong with that already tells enough about you as a person.", "YTA. blood is thicker than fanny juice mate.", "INFO: why did they break up? \n\nRegardless YTA, I can\u2019t really imagine being comfortable with their sibling dating their ex, unless it was a completely amicable split - but even then it\u2019s a weird.", "NAH. You\u2019re both adults and (I\u2019m assuming) no cheating was involved, but this is probably uncomfortable for your brother. Maybe give him some time and make sure you and your gf are on the same page if you decide to keep dating.", "NAH. I don't blame him for feeling this way however he should not tell you who to date.", "NAH\n\nWithout knowing the reason why they broke up, there is nothing to judge your brother's feelings of being disrespected against.", "NTA - but it is a tough situation. Your brother is not budging on his stand and your stand is you want to date her. Maybe I'm biased because I met my wife when she came to our apartment for a date with my roomate. But there is no real way to compromise here. Ask your brother if he still has strong feelings for her because that will be a red flag and if you date her, they may end up getting back together and you could get burned. But aside from that, at some point your brother will probably have a new girlfriend and this will be less important to him and then there is the one in ten rule where only one of 10 girls you date are suitable for a long term relationship. So things will work themselves out over time. And if she is the 'one' you can always make him the best man. I will probably get downvoted for this but oh well.", "ESH lol", "I am curious to know why they broke up. If it wasn't a mutual break up or she did something messed up, I can see why he wouldn't want her around. More information is needed.\n\nAlso, it would have probably been wise to discuss with your brother about dating her before it actually happened and emotions got involved. \n\nLastly, your brother doesn't own his ex-girlfriend. She is free to date whoever she wants, although she probably knew this would cause drama. And I imagine you never made a promise to not date her. I would say make sure she wants to date you for you versus her dating you just to get back at her ex. They did just break up months ago, so her choosing to date you makes me wonder about her intentions. That sort of drama is the last thing you need.", "I didn\u2019t need to read past the first sentence.", "Absolutely! If they\u2019d dated for a few months a couple years ago, mayyyyybe it\u2019d be a different story, but this is weird and disrespectful. Maybe the gf is trying to get back at the brother", "I read the title and thought...\"hmm, maybe there's a story behind this.\"\n\nThen I read less than a 1/4 of the post and thought....\"Dude, you suck. I wouldn't want you as a friend, let alone a brother.\" YTA\n\nSometimes more info is needed, but if there were more information to this that would validate the situation, I feel like they would have made sure it were included.\n\nThere might be times that this could be acceptable, but that always comes with a blessing from your \"bro\" before any action is taken.", "Imagine meeting the parents. \"Oh hey mum and dad, you remember Jess, she was at Christmas last year?\"", "Yeah OP really needs to study up on the Bro Code. There really isn't any other interpretation this rule.", "Yep, OP is trying to clean their conscious by making his brother out to be irrational for his very valid feelings. It's a stab in the back from a family member. Not to mention, the ex is most likely just using OP to get to the brother, yikes...", "Second that", "As did I. YTA", "I did read til the end so you don\u2019t have to and I can confirm it didn\u2019t get better. OP YTA big time.", "I hope that every time he sticks his penis into this woman, he imagines his brother's penis too.", "Maybe OP likes the thought of a sibling snowball fight.", "She is a person, not someone's castoff. It's not as a woman loses value  after a man's penis has touched", "OP , u have no values and are a shit brother", "His brother wouldn't have to tell him what to do if he wasn't TAH to start with.", "Roommate? Brother? Different dynamics there. Also met  her when she was meet up to go on \u201ca\u201d date not after your roommates was in a relationship with her for two years. Not the same.", "Self preservation kicked in at this description. My brain threw out an Error 404, and I'm totally ok with that.", "I am aware that she has not either  lost value. I think you may have misunderstood me.\n1. I am also female\n\n2. I would not go out with someone who a relative has been with.\n\n3 . I agree castoff was a poor choice of word.\n\nBut I do think that this will ruin the brothers relationship", "Good points."]}
