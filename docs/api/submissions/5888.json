{"id": 5888, "submission_id": "zxmiba", "title": "AITA For not doing the activity my husband picked on vacation even though he did the one I wanted", "selftext": "My husband and I recently went on a long-overdue vacation to a tropical island.  We stayed at an all-inclusive resort but we also wanted to get out and actually explore the island as well.  So we decided that each of us could pick an activity to do that would get us off the resort for a day.  I picked a hike that would bring us up into the mountainous interior of the island and through some rainforests. My husband is not a big hiker, but he agreed to do it with me.  My husband narrowed his choices down to two options, a catamaran trip to go snorkeling and dune buggy riding.\n\nI get horrible motion sickness.  We had some mild turbulence on our flight to the island and even with the Dramamine I took before we took off, I still got nauseous and lightheaded. I told my husband that both of the ideas he picked are things that I know for a fact would make me motion sick.  He told me that it probably wouldn't be that bad but I told him that I know my body and I know without a doubt that both of those activities would make me sick.  I asked him if there were any other activities that he was interested in, but he said those 2 were the only ones that piqued his interest.  \n\nHe eventually agreed to go on the hike trip first and then we can figure out the activity that he wants to do.  While on our hike we started talking with another couple that was also staying at our resort.  They had been there a couple of times before and my husband asked if they had done either of the activities that he wanted to do.  They had done both and said that both were a lot of fun.  But the wife did say that the catamaran trip was pretty rough at times and a couple of people on their trip got seasick.  She also said that the dune buggy was fun because you get to drive it yourself, but it's mostly on dirt tracks that can get pretty bumpy.\n\nFrom the way she described it, I knew that if I did either of those things, I would get sick.  When we got back from the hike, I told my husband that I don't want to do either of the activities he wants to do and asked again if he can please pick something else for us to do.  He said those were the only 2 things he liked, and if I don't want to do them, we won't because he doesn't want to go alone.\n\nI knew he was upset because he was really excited talking about both the things he wanted to do and after I told him I wouldn't do them, his demeanor definitely changed.  I wouldn't say he was sulking, but he was definitely less animated and not his usual fun self.  He pretty much spent the rest of our trip just sitting around the pool doing nothing.  I tried to get him to do things with me, like get a massage, but he told me to go do that myself.\n\nWhen he didn't change his attitude I finally asked him what was up and he told me that he went outside of his comfort zone to go on a hike with me, but I wouldn't do the same for him.  I told him that hiking doesn't make him sick so that's a big difference but he told me I could have at least tried one of them.", "created_utc": 1672265109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxmiba/aita_for_not_doing_the_activity_my_husband_picked/", "score": 4184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As someone with extreme motion sickness all my life, I know what will and won't trigger it. Her motion sickness would have ruined any enjoyment husband would have been able to get out of the activity because he'd be having to attend to it.

Edited to add: You were transparent that you didn't want to do those things for a totally legitimate reason. I also understand feeling disappointed that he put a damper on things when he didn't get to do what he wanted. \n\nHOWEVER, I feel like where you lose me is the \"deal\" you made where you got to do what you wanted, and he was left feeling like he missed out.\n\nIf you couldn't agree on activities you both liked or follow through on the compromise of you both getting to plan a day, you could have agreed to just not do anything off resort. My wife and I have done the all-inclusive thing, and there is plenty of fun to be had just enjoying each other's company on the beach or by the pool, many offer events at night like music or dancing, etc.\n\nYou pushing him to do the thing YOU like, but know he doesn't, all while knowing full well that you were never going to do the things he was excited about is a pretty selfish move. Y'all should have planned better in advance and made sure you were both happy with what was planned vs. Making sure your desires were covered and agreeing to figure out what he wanted while you were already on vacation. \n\nYou played a game of chicken where you both assumed the other would roll over, and instead, you both lost out. Just try to communicate better next time!", "Slight YTA. You made a deal then backed out after you got your part. You weren't even willing to try either of the options your husband picked. I know you felt you had your reasons, but the end result is the same.\n\nThat being said, I also suffer from motion sickness. Horribly. Dramamine does nothing against it. Actually, it's been proven that ginger works better than Dramamine, but that wasn't enough for me, either. It is easily fixed with motion sickness patches. They last 3 days each and work miracles. It's a prescription you can get from your doctor and use as needed. Just a 1.5cm (approx) patch that you put behind your ear. It's an option to make things a bit easier.", "Tropical Island vacation for someone who has severe dizziness problems\u2026may need to rethink where you go.

The lack of basic empathy and complete ignorance of how debilitating motion sickness can be is so disappointing to read. I mean how selfish do you have to be to prioritize a vacation activity over the well being of someone you are supposed to love? Is OP married to Homer Simpson or something? The people minimizing motion sickness as being no big deal and easily addressed with dramamine have no idea what they are talking about (and how the hell is OP supposed to \"just try\" a freaking catamaran boat? Is she supposed to jump off and swim back when she gets sick?) I'm sorry that your husband and these reddit commenters don't seem to care about your suffering. The reddit community is often disappointing but your husband should love you better than that. He's a grown-ass adult who can go on a buggy ride by himself ffs. NTA", "YTA. your husband participated in your selected activity, even though he doesn't like hiking.  You didn't even try either of his selected options.  You broke your promise.  You allowed yourself to be talked out of it by new acquaintances because of your fears.    Your husband is right:  you could have at least tried one of the activities.", "I think you should have tried one of the activities with dramamine.  You can take 2 if 1 is not enough, but I get motion sick and have rarely needed 2.  You are really limiting what he can do.  Is he never going to go on a boat ride during the course of marriage???  I'm usually fine doing activities solo, but excursions are at least 1/2 day and I can understand him wanting to be with you while doing it.  Also, why would you say up front you would do what he wanted is you had stipulations?  YTA", "YTA.  I hope next time your husband decides to go alone on the activity, it would be a nice break from a complainer.\n\nSidenote - You remind me of a friend I went with on a cruise.  She didn't like the main dining room so she didn't accompany me to dinner.  So I went on my own and met nice people who invited me to their table.  She wanted to try a different diner, so I told her to go on her own.  She said \"I don't want to go by myself\".  So it was ok for her to leave me stranded, but I had to run with her?  Nope, she got a taste of how she treated me.", "YTA...you backed out after he did your activity...you should have sucked it up and done his chosen activity.", "Personally disagree with the Y T A judgement. I wouldn\u2019t want my partner to do something he was uncomfortable doing, because it would no longer be fun for me if he was unhappy or uncomfortable. (And I say that knowing I have a kind angel partner who would do it.) Especially with OP saying they know their own body and wouldn\u2019t feel good.  But I do think ESH because it was a weird agreement to make, OP. Why would you agree to let him pick instead of making decisions on what\u2019s fun together? You\u2019re trying to negotiate the terms now when that always should have been the agreement, especially if the vacation had activities you wouldn\u2019t like.\n\nEdit; after reading your comments, you really should both be collaborating more man.

I can only assume all these other commenters don\u2019t suffer from motion sickness. I get it terribly and Dramamine doesn\u2019t cut it. There is no way I could step foot on the boat. I sincerely doubt I could do the dune buggy. And what is he thinking\u2026.you\u2019ll puke and he\u2019ll just have you get out of the dune buggy and sit on a sand dune for a few hours?! That\u2019s absurd.", "YTA. I get motion sick really easily but that's what Less Drowsy Dramamine is for. It's just downright selfish that this trip wound up being all about you. He's allowed to be bummed that what he wanted was ignored, but whatever you want goes.", "NTA. Frankly I think your husband is kind of an asshole for being unwilling to budge on choosing activities that he knows will most likely make you physically ill.", "I feel like there\u2019s a loooottt of people on this post who don\u2019t get motion sick!  I did a side by side rental with my husband once where we went on very bumpy roads and I have *never* been more sick. Once I started, we had to pull over every 30 mins to puke, no matter how slow we were going. Once you GET motion sick, it doesn\u2019t just go away once you stop the activity. I was sick for the next day and a half! \u201cGoing out of your comfort zone\u201d is not the same freaking thing as doing something that will likely make you vomit for 48 hours!  NTA.", "YTA because you didn\u2019t even try. I used to have a wild dairy allergy but now and then I\u2019d give it a try, keeping my expectations low. Wonder of wonders\u2014one day it was fine, and the allergy had subsided, after 8 long years. Maybe TRY things, with the understanding that you will disembark if you can\u2019t handle it? Not easy to do with a catamaran, but a piece of cake in a dune buggy.", "NTA. He knows you get motion sick. It sucks that it keeps you from doing stuff he wants to do, but would he prefer you vomit?", "In your shoes, once he got sulky, I\u2019d probably have done it his way and gotten sick just to prove a point. Without complaining. That would be less suffering than dealing with him playing the victim.\n\nIt was a mistake to lead him on when you were already predicting you wouldn\u2019t be willing to do either activity.", "NAH but neither is he for being upset, his response wasnt great though and border line A H territory. This argument about comfort zones people are making are nonsense. Every resort I have been to these excursions cost hundreds of dollars so you go get sick, sit out, and he either does it alone or sits with you while they finish out the trip. You know your body and you know you would get sick, would he have missed out to care for you? What was his plan? Now what COULD have been done is you ask if you are able to attend and watch without participation, in my experience as long as someone is paying they're amenable to accommodations so you could have gone out to the dune and just watched him drive if being seen by you doing the activity was so importantto him. Hiking which would have made him tired and maybe he didn't enjoy it is different then something that would have made you sick and likely ruined your day. He should have done them alone seeing as how he ended up doing things alone while he sulked anyway, might as well have done something fun.", "I\u2019m going to go NAH. It\u2019s pretty crappy that he did the activity you picked, and then you backed out of the deal on his activities. I understand why he\u2019s upset and don\u2019t really blame him. However, I\u2019m also someone who has debilitating motion sickness. There\u2019s definitely a difference between doing something out of your comfort zone and doing something you KNOW will make you sick. I think skipping out on the catamaran was totally fair on your part. But maybe you could have tried the dune buggy. Since it\u2019s on land, and you/your husband control it, this seems like a safe bet where you could at least give it a shot, and if you did feel sick, you could stop and drive back at a slow, non-sickening pace. It would have been better than \u201coh I know you tried something for me, but I\u2019m going to bail on everything you\u2019re interested in.\u201d", "As someone who also feels nauseated very easily (I puked during flight turbulence when no one else on the plane did) I understand your position. I would have made the choice not to go as well, and you did ask him to pick alternatives.\n\nHim going on a hike he wasn't excited about isn't comparable to your getting seasick in order to make him happy. (I would not be happy if my partner was seasick, even if I felt great.)\n\nIt is perhaps telling he spent several days EDIT: ~~sulking~~ sitting around the pool doing nothing when he didn't get his way. Is he usually someone who would choose an activity that would bring you a lot of discomfort, or is this a one off?\n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nYour husband is right. I completely understand your motion sickness but you would have had control during the buggy riding. You could have your own and control the speed. There was an option there. Also, once you decided you were not going to do the thing she chose, you could have compromised as well. Instead of making sure you got what you wanted knowing that he wouldn\u2019t, you could have sat down together and tried to find new activities. You also could have scrapped that whole idea and just did things around the resort. \n\nYou said in the comments that this is a rare treat for you two. You made sure you got what you wanted but your husband wasn\u2019t given the same. He doesn\u2019t like hiking but you made sure it got done. You didn\u2019t say you could pick something else more his speed. This rare trip was a great trip for you. You did what you wanted and forced your husband to do what you wanted. You made a deal, backed up, offered to think about his stuff to get him on the hike, and then still wouldn\u2019t budge. \n\nThat\u2019s what really makes you the AH to me. You made sure you got your hike and never considered picking something else. You even used it as leverage for you\u2019d figure out his activity. You gave him a glimmer of hope to make sure you got what you wanted. That\u2019s really unfair.", "Yta, and rip your husband, he deserves better", "YTA. If you were aware how you were feeling you should've changed your activity to something you'd BOTH enjoy or not ask him to go with you at all. Because what you did was highly unfair.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t even willing to try these activities. You can take motion sickness medication beforehand to help. You preemptively decided that these activities aren\u2019t for you, so refuse to even attempt despite the agreement with your husband.", "YTA. Why suggest that each of you get to pick an activity if you\u2019re not willing to step out of your comfort zone? It seems like you both have different interests and he was willing to compromise to support you. \nI get sea sickness being a barrier, but driving a vehicle? You can control how fast it goes.

They also make patches and medications for motion sickness.", "YTA", "Why make him pick something else? Just let him do what he wants. \n\nBe ready to meet him after his adventure and listen to him excitedly tell you about it.\n\nIf he really wanted it to be something y'all did together, then he would have been able to CHOOSE another activity. Not have you telling him to do it.\n\nYTA.", "Why would your husband want you to risk likely sickness for a simple excursion.

But he was so happy that made me happy. \n\nAlternatively, I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable doing a trip to an area with high bear activity and that he was welcome to go but I absolutely would not. \n\nNeither of us went and neither of us went back on our word to each other.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. Your husband was hugely passive aggressive. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a stranger organising a group activity, he\u2019s your husband, who knows you have motion sickness. Picking 2 things you almost certainly can\u2019t do and refusing all interest in anything else is an odd thing to do. Sulking for the rest of the holiday is petty and spiteful. \n\nYou should deal with your motion sickness but it feels like he\u2019s staking a lot on his personality being things you can\u2019t participate in. I can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s got another issue he\u2019s trying to avoid dealing with by manoeuvring you into being in the wrong. Pretending that his dislike of hiking, and your tendency to literally vomit during bumpy rides, are the same thing, and he overcame one so you should overcome the other, is wilful misrepresentation designed to mess with your head and make you feel like a bad person. \n\nI have a lot of food intolerances and when my ex was trying to check out of the relationship to get with the friend he told me not to worry about, instead of *communicating*, he suddenly became obsessed with eating out at really fancy restaurants with rich flavourful foods that I couldn\u2019t eat (you know, octopus, ostrich, not your average menu where I can usually find something), and complained that he wanted a partner who could share his favourite pastimes. He also misrepresented me as \u2018not leaving my comfort zone\u2019 for him when that would have entailed vomiting on the bathroom floor for 3 days at a time.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool that you went for the hike first with the supposed promise that you\u2019d then do his activity, but quite honestly, I suspect you were hesitant to really put your foot down, because he is quite prone to sulking if he doesn\u2019t get his way, and you don\u2019t want to confront the fact that you shouldn\u2019t actually have to tell your husband that you can\u2019t do these activities. He shouldn\u2019t be pressuring you into something that will make you sick. He shouldn\u2019t have chosen, as the only activities he was willing to do, things that would make you sick.

It should go without saying that the selected activities should be reasonable choices and that making you literally, physically sick is not a reasonable choice.", "NTA, you shouldn't be expected to make yourself sick to keep things even.

Thats hella mean of him to expect you to do something you physically can\u2019t do versus him not \u201cpreferring\u201d hiking. This is crazy. He can go on his own or choose something else y\u2019all can actually do together even if it\u2019s not your favorite thing. People here are taking the \u201cdeal\u201d way too seriously. I\u2019m sure you just meant for each of you to research and decide on one thing each you both can reasonably do together. That doesn\u2019t mean there are no limits or conditions. Wth lol. Heres a real example of a compromise. I am not very food adventurous and my partner is. He wanted me to try some things I normally wouldn\u2019t try. I did not want to but I did because I was capable of it and it would make him happy to order a plate he didn\u2019t have to finish himself.

We stayed at an all-inclusive resort but we also wanted to get out and actually explore the island as well.  So we decided that each of us could pick an activity to do that would get us off the resort for a day.  I picked a hike that would bring us up into the mountainous interior of the island and through some rainforests. My husband is not a big hiker, but he agreed to do it with me.  My husband narrowed his choices down to two options, a catamaran trip to go snorkeling and dune buggy riding.\n\nI get horrible motion sickness.  We had some mild turbulence on our flight to the island and even with the Dramamine I took before we took off, I still got nauseous and lightheaded. I told my husband that both of the ideas he picked are things that I know for a fact would make me motion sick.  He told me that it probably wouldn't be that bad but I told him that I know my body and I know without a doubt that both of those activities would make me sick.  I asked him if there were any other activities that he was interested in, but he said those 2 were the only ones that piqued his interest.  \n\nHe eventually agreed to go on the hike trip first and then we can figure out the activity that he wants to do.  While on our hike we started talking with another couple that was also staying at our resort.  They had been there a couple of times before and my husband asked if they had done either of the activities that he wanted to do.  They had done both and said that both were a lot of fun.  But the wife did say that the catamaran trip was pretty rough at times and a couple of people on their trip got seasick.  She also said that the dune buggy was fun because you get to drive it yourself, but it's mostly on dirt tracks that can get pretty bumpy.\n\nFrom the way she described it, I knew that if I did either of those things, I would get sick.  When we got back from the hike, I told my husband that I don't want to do either of the activities he wants to do and asked again if he can please pick something else for us to do.  He said those were the only 2 things he liked, and if I don't want to do them, we won't because he doesn't want to go alone.\n\nI knew he was upset because he was really excited talking about both the things he wanted to do and after I told him I wouldn't do them, his demeanor definitely changed.  I wouldn't say he was sulking, but he was definitely less animated and not his usual fun self.  He pretty much spent the rest of our trip just sitting around the pool doing nothing.  I tried to get him to do things with me, like get a massage, but he told me to go do that myself.\n\nWhen he didn't change his attitude I finally asked him what was up and he told me that he went outside of his comfort zone to go on a hike with me, but I wouldn't do the same for him.  I told him that hiking doesn't make him sick so that's a big difference but he told me I could have at least tried one of them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was willing to do something for you even though he didn't want to. You weren't willing to do the same for him. He has good reason to be upset with you. Also, something feels off about \"He eventually agreed to go on the hike trip first and then we can figure out the activity that he wants to do.\" This sounds like you either strung him along with false hope or somehow failed to adequately convey you would NOT be doing those things he wanted to. \n\nI don't get motion sickness so I can't relate personally on how impactful it can be, but you're complete unwillingness to even try something for him is what makes you an AH. If you were so not willing to do what he wanted, then why did you have him agree to do what you wanted? It would have been safer to find something you both could partially enjoy instead of something only one person wanted. You husband did go through with the excursion for you which I think saves him from being an AH. His passive aggressive reaction to not getting his way does not make him an AH in my mind.

I would in fact support him saying no to hiking even if the reason was a simple as he just doesn\u2019t like it. If this post was asking if OP was the AH for pushing him to go hiking even when he said he didn\u2019t want to my verdict would be different but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. \n\nOP refusing to do either of the two activities does not make them an AH. OP refusing even after he agreed to go hiking when he doesn\u2019t really care for hiking still does not make them an AH. OP picking hiking when he doesn\u2019t like hiking does not make them an AH.

It sounds like everything OP wanted to do was different from everything the husband wanted to do.\n\nThey also both need to detach a bit and just be okay doing some activities solo. I get it\u2019s a couples vacation and all, but if you choose to go someplace where the big activities are things where you have no overlapping interest, spend some time doing your own thing. You don\u2019t have to share every interest or force yourself to do something or not do something like hike or boat just for your partner.

Most of the trip was fine, one night there was a storm and the ship bounced a bit and I had to leave dinner early to go lay down, and it was the meal I'd been looking forward to. \n\nBut the little boat ride to the island we spent an excursion on was horrible. I spent the entire time hunched over staring only at the floor, then when we got to the island we had to stand around in the sun and listen to all the rules and whatnot. I laid in the shade drinking water for an hour before I could actually enjoy the beach...then we had to take the boat back. \n\nAnyways, they didn't work for me, but I kept wearing them because I didn't want to risk taking them off and it getting worse. Lol I doubt I'll ever be on a cruise again, but I'm done having babies so I'd probably give the little boat another chance, but if 8 knew that's how it would be no matter what, yeah no, I'm not doing that.", "[deleted]", "I'm sorry but it feels like you're inserting too much assumptions, and ignoring the context that was given by OP. I think most of us have experienced motion sickness at one point or another. Hell recently I almost threw up on a car ride home from a hike. I doubt most, if any of us are downplaying OP's experience because she's a woman. We think she's an AH because she basically misled her husband into a partaking an activity he didn't like with the illusion of compromise.\n\nShe doesn't want to go on a catamaran because she'll get sick, cool, totally understandable. She also refuses to try the dune buggy ride where they get to drive themselves, because she'll still get motion sickness? How does she get from point A to point B at home? A lot less believable IN MY EXPERIENCE, but ok. The kicker though is that she cemented her veto AFTER they completed an activity her husband didn't want to do.\n\nIf she and her husband can't come to an agreement on two activities they came up by themselves then you don't do either of those and you compromise. At this point the disparity between the reasons doesn't matter, you don't deceive the other into thinking the option is still in the books so you get to do what you want.\n\nThe genders could be switched and I'd still think OP's partner is patient to put up with all that.", "Oh okay so now I\u2019m misogynistic? Now your just proving my comment :)", "He agreed to the hiking though and doesn't get ill from it. He chose the two things thatd make her physically ill.\n\nShe asked him to pick something else (they are on a tropical island with probably a million things to do) and he's insisting on the things that will make her sick\n\nShe didn't choose hiking because he disliked it but because she likes it and hubby at the time was OK enough with it\n\nHe then wanted to do something she can't (or else she literally gets sick) \n\nShe didn't trick him into hiking. She asked and he agreed. When he asked for his things she said she couldn't. She didn't lie or trick him or deceive him into walking in a jungle. She literally asked him to choose other things. He's being unreasonable.", "Tolerating a hike for your spouse is not the same as inducing vomiting and nausea.\n\nDo you really think it's cool that the husband picked activities that he knows are almost certain to trigger an extreme physical reaction?

I asked him if there were any other activities that he was interested in, but he said those 2 were the only ones that piqued his interest.\n\n>He eventually agreed to go on the hike trip first and then we can figure out the activity that he wants to do. \n\nShe gave VERY CLEAR nos, and he said \"we'll figure it out later\" in the hopes of getting her to change her mind.", "All she said was he was less animated, sitting around the pool, and didn't want to get a massage.

Like you said, **she didn\u2019t even try.** \n\nHonestly, in my experience, being on a catamaran isn\u2019t as bad if you stay above deck and have the wind in your face. You also feel much better once you\u2019ve thrown up. Similar with a dune buggy, having the wind in your face is a big help, and you can stop whenever. **ALSO, if you\u2019re the one driving, you somehow become less sensitive to motion sickness.** This is because you are focused on driving and because you can anticipate the bumps.", "When did she lie?

I have very weird reactions to a lot of basic medications, so there\u2019s a lot of things I just can\u2019t take. I cannot take any kind of cough medication. I can\u2019t take anything that makes you drowsy. Even the \u201cnon-drowsy\u201d Benadryl will knock me on my ass. \n\nI\u2019ve tried the $100 watch that gives a little electric shocks. It helps a little bit but not that much. All natural Benadryl which( is really just concentrated Ginger) does help\u2014but only if I\u2019m in a situation where whatever\u2019s making me have motion sickness is pretty mild. \n\nA catamaran or a dune buggy would both be my idea of a nightmare. My husband would never suggest that I try one of those to make him happy because if it doesn\u2019t work I\u2019m gonna be the one that is sick for hours. Motion sickness doesn\u2019t just stop when you get out of the car or off the boat. The worse the sickness, the longer it lasts. I\u2019ve gotten motion sick from car rides that made me so sick that by the time I got out of the car, it took me like eight hours to feel OK again. \n\nSo how is it fine that he\u2019s asking her to \u201cjust give that a try.\u201d She knows her body. Not only will I say that she\u2019s NOT the asshole, I\u2019m gonna say he\u2019s an asshole for wanting to to take a chance on his wife getting horribly ill.

Nothing has ever helped me with my motion sickness. Everyone said when you learn to drive it\u2019ll go away but I spent my driving lessons vomiting. It\u2019s easy to say just take x but it\u2019s never that simple. Plus when I have triggered my motion sickness, it can then further trigger vertigo attacks that last for days. I wouldn\u2019t be willing to wreck the rest of my \u2018long overdue holiday\u2019 just to make it so that my stubborn and uncaring partner could win the situation.

But giving her husband hope that they\u2019d get to do something he wanted and then backing out after she got to do what she wanted to do is messed up. I\u2019d be pretty hurt by that too, especially since she said they only take one vacation every 5 years.", "I interpreted that as her saying no to those two options because she would get sick and then them agreeing to wait until after the hike to figure out which activity he would pick from a larger list of available activities. It just so happened that on the hike, he spoke to the other couple which made him want to do the buggy or catamaran even more, leading to him refusing to consider any other available activities.", "I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s such a pain in the ass to deal with! And if you are already vomiting while learning to drive than driving might not help your motion sickness. I find that when I drive, I am way less likely to get sick. However, if there\u2019s a lot of stopping and going I will get sick even if I\u2019m driving\u2014 and then it\u2019s much worse because I have to focus on driving while I feel like I\u2019m gonna die.", "Okay, I see what you\u2019re saying. That is definitely odd and makes it seem like she\u2019s possibly not telling us the whole story. I take back my judgment that he\u2019s an asshole but I still don\u2019t know enough to say that she\u2019s an asshole. I feel a lot of empathy for anyone who deals with motion sickness, can\u2019t help but relate.", "You definitely have a point\u2014I could see it being that.

Good point though!", "NAH. \n\nFirst of all, as others have described, motion sickness can be truly miserable, debilitating and long-lasting. I\u2019m only mildly prone, but I\u2019ve had it wreck me for a whole day afterward. \n\nAlso, If I understand correctly, you never indicated that you would participate in the activities. You might have been clearer about this from the start, or at least before the hike. I don\u2019t blame him for feeling a bit salty, but he should care about not making you physically ill. You did say his behavior was short of sulking. Disappointment seems fair, though I\u2019m not crazy about his saying you could have tried. I think you\u2019ve each got 2.5/10 asshole points so far. \n\nIn your situation I\u2019d feel regretful about his disappointment. Does he have a friend or brother that he could go do this stuff with? I get his not wanting to go alone. I also think it\u2019s good for couples to have separate interests, and not to have to choose between a desired activity and your partner.", "Info. \n\nWhy not have activity 1 be something you both enjoy and then agree activity 2 be seperare activities that you share with eachother at dinner? The \"we will figure it out there\" seems like setting yourselves up for failure when you knew there was no way for him to win.", "NTA\n\nYour pick didn't risk making your husband physically sick.

Or is he really unfit, or in pain, so you dragged him up a mountain while he cried inside?", "Maybe should\u2019ve each done an activity solo (since he didn\u2019t really want to hike) then do stuff together. Instead, he went on the hike, with you knowing you would not participate in his choices all along. YTA.", "NAH \n\nYour husband could only find two things that really interested him and excited him.

However not being able to do the two things he really wanted to do with his partner probably understandably dampened his excitement for the trip.", "NAH. I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to do this when it makes you sick. My wife is same on boats and it really ruins her experience. On the other hand, I empathise with your husband.

Instead of finding a compromise you talked him into doing what you wanted but he doesn't get to do what he wants.\n\nIf those 2 activities were such a big no for you, you should've found ones that weren't the top pick for either of you but still somewhat enjoyable for both of you rather than picking something only you would enjoy and then nothing for him", "YTA, should have just skipped out on both if you couldn't come to an agreement about his part.

Why are you surprised he was upset?", "Info: How did you get to the island? \n\n>We had some mild turbulence on our flight to the island and even with the Dramamine I took before we took off, I still got nauseous and lightheaded.\n\nSo you were willing to face the consequences of your motion sickness to get to your vacation destination. \n\nBecause you knew it was temporary and the rewards outweighed the risks. \n\nI get that, my husband and I both have issues with motion sickness. Sometimes you have to deal with it to get the reward of the vacation. \n\n>So we decided that each of us could pick an activity to do that would get us off the resort for a day. \n\nYou made an agreement with your husband. \n\n>My husband is not a big hiker, but he agreed to do it with me.\n\nSo he agreed to participate in an activity he doesn't like, that might leave him sore and achy by the end of the day, especially if he is not an avid hiker. \n\n>But the wife did say that the catamaran trip was pretty rough at times and a couple of people on their trip got seasick.\n\nOk the Catamaran makes people sea sick, probably best avoided. \n\n>She also said that the dune buggy was fun because you get to drive it yourself, but it's mostly on dirt tracks that can get pretty bumpy.\n\nSo this sounds like the win. You are incontrol and driving, the thing that most of us with motion sickness figure out real early in life makes a difference. \n\n>From the way she described it, I knew that if I did either of those things, I would get sick.\n\nHere is where you become an AH. \n\nI get the catamaran, but unless you never drive, take a bus, train or any other mode of transportation, you are being difficult. \n\nYou wouldn't even try a dune buggy on a closed track that you drove. You didn't even go with your husband to look at the track. You did not consider any way to mitigate your motion sickness, just vetoed the activity based on a second hand account. \n\nThe risk of your possible motion sickness was more important to you than the benifits of keeping an agreement with your husband and *trying* an activity of his choice. \n\nYou have always had motion sickness, before you left for vacation. You wanted to leave the resort, which alone requires travel and risks motion sickness. It was fine for activities you want to do but not for him. \n\nYou could have tried a round on the track and cheered him on after. But you didn't even try.\n\nSo yeah YTA.", "Those were the only things that interested him and he didn't want to go alone, which makes sense to me. I'm not doing any of those activities alone either, especially not when I'm on vacation with my partner.\n\nThen he sat at the pool, which is what I presume you planned to do already at the all inclusive resort that you had no idea offered any activities until you already arrived. I guess maybe a beach, if that's an option. Not everyone always wants a massage, and a massage when you're in a bad mood is less than great. It's 90 minutes of being alone, in your own head, forcing yourself to remain still. \n\nAnd I can't blame him for being in a bit of a mood. You guys had a deal in place. You saw the options, and convinced him to do your thing when you knew full well you had no intention of ever doing his thing. That's dishonest, and upsetting to be on the other end of. You could have called off the deal, you could have found one activity you both agreed on, or you could make sure you get what you want and telling your partner they're SoL when it's their turn. \n\nThe problem is the dishonesty and deceit. The selfish way with which you went about it to to make sure you got yours, knowing that you had absolutely no intent to hold up your end of the bargain. The time to talk it out was before the hike, to make sure that everyone is happy with the compromise, not after the hike, to make sure that only you are happy. YTA.\n\nEdit: Everyone saying N-T-A is acting as if the only option was to go on the boat and get sick and just vomit all over. The problem is the lack of communication, communication OP specifically pushed off until AFTER her activity. \"He eventually agreed to go on the hike trip first and then we can figure out the activity that he wants to do.\" This is after she already knew those were the ONLY TWO that interested him.

Your eyes are telling you one thing, but your inner ear is saying something else. That's why you feel sick.\n\nAlso, when you're partaking in a group activity, you actually *can't* just separate from the group whenever. Because they would see that as a safety concern. You either end *everyone's* activity early, or you're stuck there until it's over.\n\nTo compound that even further - often activities like this are physically isolated.

You let him believe if he stepped out of his comfort zone for a hike for you then you would step out of yours for an activity for him. If you know your limits you should have communicated them instead of manipulating your husband into doing something he didn\u2019t want to do and then back pedaling.

He went out of his comfort zone so you didn't have to hike alone and you refused to even try his activity, even after agreeing to it.\n\nFor those saying hiking and motion sickness is not the same, I would disagree. Hiking has way more risks, as most all inclusive resorts are in places where it's pretty dodgy outside the resort and trails are not likely to be well maintained or marked. Also, not everybody is in decent enough shape to hike into the \"island's interior\"\n\nThe right thing for you to do, was if you both couldn't agree activities you were comfortable with, you should have just done the hike alone. That way, he wouldn't feel that you pulled a bait and switch on him.\n\nYou didn't say in your post if you have children, but what if you agreed that you would go back to work after having kids and suddenly reneged and unilaterally decided to be a SAHM. If that situation strikes you as not okay, this is no different.", "YTA - You're not necessarily the AH for not wanting to go on his things but you knew going into it that there was ZERO chance you were going to do either of those activities and you still seemingly 'left him on the hook'. You also knew beforehand that he specifically stated that those were the only 2 things he was interested in... sounds like you should've said up front \"I'm physically incapable of doing what you want to do so you are 100% freed of any obligation to do what I wanted to. Our solution going forward is to either do these activities solo or abandon these activities all together\"... I mean, he told you straight up relaxing, buggies, or catamaran. You nixed the last two, so relaxing by the pool was all he had left, but that still didn't seem to satisfy you. You suggested things you wanted to do that (by default) he already told you that he wasnt intersted in doing. You even said he didn't sulk whatsoever. \n\nI don't know OP, so this is just speculation, but I wonder how bad her motion sickness actually is... my wife gets pretty bad motion sickness and any turbulence would've made her puke (and did) last time we flew and she was completely down for day 1 of our honeymoon... I felt so bad for her...  You say your flight had 'mild turbulance', and you got 'dizzy and lightheaded'... you didn't vomit all over and have to spend the first day of vacation sick in the room so... how bad is it really? \n\nOP seems to present it like it's a certainty she will vomit to death on a dune buggie ride but can handle a turbulent flight with nothing more than a little dizziness. OP, are you able to ride or drive in a car? Did you even visit the dune buggie place to see how bumpy or rough it might actually be? Watch any videos of it? Or did you just hear what you wanted to hear from the couple hiking and use it as confirmation bias that the idea wasn't even worth entertaining???  I'm not saying you should have tried it but at least it would've showed a bit more serious interest that you really wanted to give his activity an honest shot. \n\nAlso, to address some of you with your own motion sickness that seem to want to say that he's and AH because he doesn't know what it's like and you can't compare it to his having to hike... uh... WTF? Maybe the husband has his own physical issues that makes hiking very discomforting for him. Bad leg? Back? Overweight? Just not a physical type person? Gets winded easily? Allergic to stuff in a forest that's not at the resort? Asthma?  All of those things and more could be worse off for him than OP getting a touch dizzy when he's driving the buggie. Walking up a mountain through a forrest may make him vomit and pass out... I realize I make an assumption that her nausea isn't that bad but that's no different than all of you assuming since 'he's not really a hiker' that means all he had to do was get off his lazy ass and walk a little bit. Maybe there's a good reason he's not really into hiking that OP is leaving out... there mat not be... if he simply just went on the hike to have ammunition to use against her to convince her to go do either activity then sure... he'd be the AH, but his actions don't suggest that here based on OPs description of events. \n\nOne thing i don't understand is... I get you want your partner to be happy and cheerful all the time but for some reason, he still had the impression that there was a shot you would do these with him upon arriving even though you seemed to indicate that before you left, you were 100% against it since you know your body. You say he 'eventually' agreed then say you went on the hike... when did he agree to figure out what his activity would be? Was it a day or two after the initial conversation or literally right before you went on the hike? \n\nI feel like we're missing some information and there is either an attempt by him to emotionally manipulate her into doing something she doesn't want to do because he doesnt believe her about her nausea, he thinks she uses it as an excuse to not do certain things, or OP is actually using her 'illness' to manipulate him by making him think he had a shot to do those things with her right up to the end of the hike... even when talking to the couple while hiking it seems like she could've said \"see honey, you should still go do those if they sound fun but sounds like she's confirming what I suspected, that I wouldn't physically be able to without getting sick\" but instead she seems to indicate that he thinks these things are still on the table for her to do when she leads us to believe she was very clear weeks before the trip she couldn't do those things...", "Not like he could have picked something that wouldn't make his damn partner sick right?", "ESH.

Then when it came time for his activity, she decided \u201cno, I\u2019m not following through on our promised agreement\u201d. This is coming from a person who was massively motion sickness as a child, and still somewhat plagued by it now, but definitely not as bad anymore.

Not only that, she decided only AFTER they do her event, to tell him \u201cfuck your events, I don\u2019t want to do it\u201d. Motion sickness is a valid excuse not to do an activity, I agree. But when you manipulate and give off false promises and then use your motion sickness as an EXCUSE not to do something, that\u2019s where I draw the line. It\u2019s like using a disability to your advantage while giving nothing back, always falling back on your disability to gain sympathy points.

It\u2019s about communication, and it\u2019s the fact that the husband communicated pretty well and straightforward what he wanted to do and if there\u2019s any changes to be done, do it now. She manipulated him and found a way to coerce her partner to go on this trip with her, being very vague on if she even will join him on his event, knowing FULL WELL she would never do it, and then only bringing it up AFTER her event is done. It\u2019s scumbaggy and insulting. She could\u2019ve voiced her side better and they could\u2019ve come to a compromise, but it looked like they both were headstrong on their activities.

Part of that included a long road trip on very windy roads. I felt a little light headed and irritable but mostly okay during the trip.
