{"id": 5888, "submission_id": "zxmiba", "title": "AITA For not doing the activity my husband picked on vacation even though he did the one I wanted", "selftext": "My husband and I recently went on a long-overdue vacation to a tropical island.  We stayed at an all-inclusive resort but we also wanted to get out and actually explore the island as well.  So we decided that each of us could pick an activity to do that would get us off the resort for a day.  I picked a hike that would bring us up into the mountainous interior of the island and through some rainforests. My husband is not a big hiker, but he agreed to do it with me.  My husband narrowed his choices down to two options, a catamaran trip to go snorkeling and dune buggy riding.\n\nI get horrible motion sickness.  We had some mild turbulence on our flight to the island and even with the Dramamine I took before we took off, I still got nauseous and lightheaded. I told my husband that both of the ideas he picked are things that I know for a fact would make me motion sick.  He told me that it probably wouldn't be that bad but I told him that I know my body and I know without a doubt that both of those activities would make me sick.  I asked him if there were any other activities that he was interested in, but he said those 2 were the only ones that piqued his interest.  \n\nHe eventually agreed to go on the hike trip first and then we can figure out the activity that he wants to do.  While on our hike we started talking with another couple that was also staying at our resort.  They had been there a couple of times before and my husband asked if they had done either of the activities that he wanted to do.  They had done both and said that both were a lot of fun.  But the wife did say that the catamaran trip was pretty rough at times and a couple of people on their trip got seasick.  She also said that the dune buggy was fun because you get to drive it yourself, but it's mostly on dirt tracks that can get pretty bumpy.\n\nFrom the way she described it, I knew that if I did either of those things, I would get sick.  When we got back from the hike, I told my husband that I don't want to do either of the activities he wants to do and asked again if he can please pick something else for us to do.  He said those were the only 2 things he liked, and if I don't want to do them, we won't because he doesn't want to go alone.\n\nI knew he was upset because he was really excited talking about both the things he wanted to do and after I told him I wouldn't do them, his demeanor definitely changed.  I wouldn't say he was sulking, but he was definitely less animated and not his usual fun self.  He pretty much spent the rest of our trip just sitting around the pool doing nothing.  I tried to get him to do things with me, like get a massage, but he told me to go do that myself.\n\nWhen he didn't change his attitude I finally asked him what was up and he told me that he went outside of his comfort zone to go on a hike with me, but I wouldn't do the same for him.  I told him that hiking doesn't make him sick so that's a big difference but he told me I could have at least tried one of them.", "created_utc": 1672265109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxmiba/aita_for_not_doing_the_activity_my_husband_picked/", "score": 1134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As someone with extreme motion sickness all my life, I know what will and won't trigger it. Her motion sickness would have ruined any enjoyment husband would have been able to get out of the activity because he'd be having to attend to it. Also, spouses are allowed to do activities separately but that's beside the point. Having her throw up would put a rapid stop to whatever they were doing at the moment.", "YTA. What is the point of making a deal when you refuse his first 2 picks? You can take damamine and ginger, etc that helps with motion sickness.", "I can get why you wouldn't go on a catamaran, but a buggy ride where you are completely in control of the movement of the vehicle?\n\nYou have a great husband for putting up with you, I'll tell you that.", "Going with ESH.\n\nI 100% understand you not wanting to risk motion sickness on your vacation, and I think your husband is an AH for expecting you to \"just try it\" when you're getting nauseated on airplane rides. Edited to add: You were transparent that you didn't want to do those things for a totally legitimate reason. I also understand feeling disappointed that he put a damper on things when he didn't get to do what he wanted. \n\nHOWEVER, I feel like where you lose me is the \"deal\" you made where you got to do what you wanted, and he was left feeling like he missed out.\n\nIf you couldn't agree on activities you both liked or follow through on the compromise of you both getting to plan a day, you could have agreed to just not do anything off resort. My wife and I have done the all-inclusive thing, and there is plenty of fun to be had just enjoying each other's company on the beach or by the pool, many offer events at night like music or dancing, etc.\n\nYou pushing him to do the thing YOU like, but know he doesn't, all while knowing full well that you were never going to do the things he was excited about is a pretty selfish move. Y'all should have planned better in advance and made sure you were both happy with what was planned vs. Making sure your desires were covered and agreeing to figure out what he wanted while you were already on vacation. \n\nYou played a game of chicken where you both assumed the other would roll over, and instead, you both lost out. Just try to communicate better next time!", "Slight YTA. You made a deal then backed out after you got your part. You weren't even willing to try either of the options your husband picked. I know you felt you had your reasons, but the end result is the same.\n\nThat being said, I also suffer from motion sickness. Horribly. Dramamine does nothing against it. Actually, it's been proven that ginger works better than Dramamine, but that wasn't enough for me, either. It is easily fixed with motion sickness patches. They last 3 days each and work miracles. It's a prescription you can get from your doctor and use as needed. Just a 1.5cm (approx) patch that you put behind your ear. It's an option to make things a bit easier.", "Tropical Island vacation for someone who has severe dizziness problems\u2026may need to rethink where you go.

I think a lot of the Y T A votes are from people who don't suffer from motion sickness.  I get it playing some games, and I feel miserable for hours.

And for making the deal in the first place when it seems you had no intention of trying once you got what you wanted. \n\nDid you attempt to find other adventure type activities he might be interested in? Or was the trip really about what you wanted to do and then you got upset when he chose to spend the rest of the vacation by the pool? \n\nThe dune buggy adventure likely would have been fine had you actually tried.", "YTA. The entire point was to get out of your comfort zone. He did. You went back on your word because of the possibility of feeling motion sick for a short while. Take a dramamine and keep your promise or just agree to do separate activities to begin with (I've never understood couples trying to get the other to do stuff they don't want to do - you don't have to do everything together). The boat ride sounds like a bad idea for you but you didn't even give the buggy ride a chance before saying no (where you guys are in charge of the speed and direction and could go slower in smoother areas for your benefit)", "YTA - you made sure to do your hike first so you could back out of his plans when you didn\u2019t like it. Sounds like a waste of a trip for your husband. Hopefully you had fun\u2026/s", "YTA. You could have tried. The dune buggy riding especially might have been fine. You sound selfish AND manipulative. Your poor husband.", "NAH but you really should have planned this trip better before you left. You each proposed activities the other didn\u2019t much want to do.

Not everybody likes massages (I don\u2019t) so I don\u2019t fault him for declining that. \n\nI don\u2019t want to call either of you an AH for having different visions for your vacation. Next time you\u2019ll know to plan farther ahead.", "YTA, while he should understand you get motion sick he definitely wanted to share those experiences with you. Perhaps let the people at the boat/scuba place know you get seasick and see if they have less turbulent options, or perhaps you could do some shallow water scuba diving and with him. There are sometimes options other then yes or no, especially for activities like these", "Are you surgically joined with him at the hip or something? Can't he just do those activities alone?", "These Y T A votes are absolutely wild. The lack of basic empathy and complete ignorance of how debilitating motion sickness can be is so disappointing to read. The people minimizing motion sickness as being no big deal and easily addressed with dramamine have no idea what they are talking about (and how the hell is OP supposed to \"just try\" a freaking catamaran boat? Is she supposed to jump off and swim back when she gets sick?) I'm sorry that your husband and these reddit commenters don't seem to care about your suffering. The reddit community is often disappointing but your husband should love you better than that. He's a grown-ass adult who can go on a buggy ride by himself ffs. NTA", "YTA. your husband participated in your selected activity, even though he doesn't like hiking.  You didn't even try either of his selected options.  You broke your promise.  You allowed yourself to be talked out of it by new acquaintances because of your fears.    Your husband is right:  you could have at least tried one of the activities.", "I think you should have tried one of the activities with dramamine.  You can take 2 if 1 is not enough, but I get motion sick and have rarely needed 2.  You are really limiting what he can do.  Is he never going to go on a boat ride during the course of marriage???  I'm usually fine doing activities solo, but excursions are at least 1/2 day and I can understand him wanting to be with you while doing it.  Also, why would you say up front you would do what he wanted is you had stipulations?  YTA", "YTA.  I hope next time your husband decides to go alone on the activity, it would be a nice break from a complainer.\n\nSidenote - You remind me of a friend I went with on a cruise.  She didn't like the main dining room so she didn't accompany me to dinner.  So I went on my own and met nice people who invited me to their table.  She wanted to try a different diner, so I told her to go on her own.  She said \"I don't want to go by myself\".  So it was ok for her to leave me stranded, but I had to run with her?  Nope, she got a taste of how she treated me.", "YTA...you backed out after he did your activity...you should have sucked it up and done his chosen activity.", "Personally disagree with the Y T A judgement. I wouldn\u2019t want my partner to do something he was uncomfortable doing, because it would no longer be fun for me if he was unhappy or uncomfortable. (And I say that knowing I have a kind angel partner who would do it.) Especially with OP saying they know their own body and wouldn\u2019t feel good.  But I do think ESH because it was a weird agreement to make, OP. Why would you agree to let him pick instead of making decisions on what\u2019s fun together? You\u2019re trying to negotiate the terms now when that always should have been the agreement, especially if the vacation had activities you wouldn\u2019t like.\n\nEdit; after reading your comments, you really should both be collaborating more man. You guys planned a vacation without either of you researching the activities there. You gotta be a team, man.", "NTA. I can only assume all these other commenters don\u2019t suffer from motion sickness. I get it terribly and Dramamine doesn\u2019t cut it. There is no way I could step foot on the boat. I sincerely doubt I could do the dune buggy. And what is he thinking\u2026.you\u2019ll puke and he\u2019ll just have you get out of the dune buggy and sit on a sand dune for a few hours?! That\u2019s absurd.", "YTA. I get motion sick really easily but that's what Less Drowsy Dramamine is for. It's just downright selfish that this trip wound up being all about you. He's allowed to be bummed that what he wanted was ignored, but whatever you want goes.", "NTA. Frankly I think your husband is kind of an asshole for being unwilling to budge on choosing activities that he knows will most likely make you physically ill.", "I feel like there\u2019s a loooottt of people on this post who don\u2019t get motion sick!  I did a side by side rental with my husband once where we went on very bumpy roads and I have *never* been more sick. Once I started, we had to pull over every 30 mins to puke, no matter how slow we were going. Once you GET motion sick, it doesn\u2019t just go away once you stop the activity. I was sick for the next day and a half! \u201cGoing out of your comfort zone\u201d is not the same freaking thing as doing something that will likely make you vomit for 48 hours!  NTA.", "YTA because you didn\u2019t even try. I used to have a wild dairy allergy but now and then I\u2019d give it a try, keeping my expectations low. Wonder of wonders\u2014one day it was fine, and the allergy had subsided, after 8 long years. Maybe TRY things, with the understanding that you will disembark if you can\u2019t handle it? Not easy to do with a catamaran, but a piece of cake in a dune buggy.", "NTA. He knows you get motion sick. It sucks that it keeps you from doing stuff he wants to do, but would he prefer you vomit?", "In your shoes, once he got sulky, I\u2019d probably have done it his way and gotten sick just to prove a point. Without complaining. That would be less suffering than dealing with him playing the victim.\n\nIt was a mistake to lead him on when you were already predicting you wouldn\u2019t be willing to do either activity.", "NAH but neither is he for being upset, his response wasnt great though and border line A H territory. This argument about comfort zones people are making are nonsense. Every resort I have been to these excursions cost hundreds of dollars so you go get sick, sit out, and he either does it alone or sits with you while they finish out the trip. You know your body and you know you would get sick, would he have missed out to care for you? What was his plan? Now what COULD have been done is you ask if you are able to attend and watch without participation, in my experience as long as someone is paying they're amenable to accommodations so you could have gone out to the dune and just watched him drive if being seen by you doing the activity was so importantto him. Hiking which would have made him tired and maybe he didn't enjoy it is different then something that would have made you sick and likely ruined your day. He should have done them alone seeing as how he ended up doing things alone while he sulked anyway, might as well have done something fun.", "I\u2019m going to go NAH. It\u2019s pretty crappy that he did the activity you picked, and then you backed out of the deal on his activities. I understand why he\u2019s upset and don\u2019t really blame him. However, I\u2019m also someone who has debilitating motion sickness. There\u2019s definitely a difference between doing something out of your comfort zone and doing something you KNOW will make you sick. I think skipping out on the catamaran was totally fair on your part. But maybe you could have tried the dune buggy. Since it\u2019s on land, and you/your husband control it, this seems like a safe bet where you could at least give it a shot, and if you did feel sick, you could stop and drive back at a slow, non-sickening pace. It would have been better than \u201coh I know you tried something for me, but I\u2019m going to bail on everything you\u2019re interested in.\u201d", "As someone who also feels nauseated very easily (I puked during flight turbulence when no one else on the plane did) I understand your position. I would have made the choice not to go as well, and you did ask him to pick alternatives.\n\nHim going on a hike he wasn't excited about isn't comparable to your getting seasick in order to make him happy. (I would not be happy if my partner was seasick, even if I felt great.)\n\nIt is perhaps telling he spent several days EDIT: ~~sulking~~ sitting around the pool doing nothing when he didn't get his way. Is he usually someone who would choose an activity that would bring you a lot of discomfort, or is this a one off?\n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nYour husband is right. I completely understand your motion sickness but you would have had control during the buggy riding. You could have your own and control the speed. There was an option there. Also, once you decided you were not going to do the thing she chose, you could have compromised as well. Instead of making sure you got what you wanted knowing that he wouldn\u2019t, you could have sat down together and tried to find new activities. You also could have scrapped that whole idea and just did things around the resort. \n\nYou said in the comments that this is a rare treat for you two. You made sure you got what you wanted but your husband wasn\u2019t given the same. He doesn\u2019t like hiking but you made sure it got done. You didn\u2019t say you could pick something else more his speed. This rare trip was a great trip for you. You did what you wanted and forced your husband to do what you wanted. You made a deal, backed up, offered to think about his stuff to get him on the hike, and then still wouldn\u2019t budge. \n\nThat\u2019s what really makes you the AH to me. You made sure you got your hike and never considered picking something else. You even used it as leverage for you\u2019d figure out his activity. You gave him a glimmer of hope to make sure you got what you wanted. That\u2019s really unfair.", "Yta, and rip your husband, he deserves better", "YTA. If you were aware how you were feeling you should've changed your activity to something you'd BOTH enjoy or not ask him to go with you at all. Because what you did was highly unfair.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t even willing to try these activities. You can take motion sickness medication beforehand to help. You preemptively decided that these activities aren\u2019t for you, so refuse to even attempt despite the agreement with your husband.", "YTA. Why suggest that each of you get to pick an activity if you\u2019re not willing to step out of your comfort zone? It seems like you both have different interests and he was willing to compromise to support you. \nI get sea sickness being a barrier, but driving a vehicle? You can control how fast it goes. I\u2019ve never heard of someone getting motion sickness off roading and the tourist versions aren\u2019t anything crazy. They also make patches and medications for motion sickness.", "YTA", "Why make him pick something else? Just let him do what he wants. \n\nBe ready to meet him after his adventure and listen to him excitedly tell you about it.\n\nIf he really wanted it to be something y'all did together, then he would have been able to CHOOSE another activity. Not have you telling him to do it.\n\nYTA.", "Why would your husband want you to risk likely sickness for a simple excursion. That\u2019s bizarre.\n\nBoth of you learn to have fun without the other.", "NTA. Everyone here sound like they don't know what being sick or living with something like this is like.", "NTa", "YTA - you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to it if you knew you weren\u2019t going to do it. My spouse and I went to Alaska (once in a lifetime type of trip) and he desperately wanted to halibut fish (I agreed) and I vomited the **entire** time on that boat. But he was so happy that made me happy. \n\nAlternatively, I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable doing a trip to an area with high bear activity and that he was welcome to go but I absolutely would not. \n\nNeither of us went and neither of us went back on our word to each other.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. Your husband was hugely passive aggressive. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a stranger organising a group activity, he\u2019s your husband, who knows you have motion sickness. Picking 2 things you almost certainly can\u2019t do and refusing all interest in anything else is an odd thing to do. Sulking for the rest of the holiday is petty and spiteful. \n\nYou should deal with your motion sickness but it feels like he\u2019s staking a lot on his personality being things you can\u2019t participate in. I can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s got another issue he\u2019s trying to avoid dealing with by manoeuvring you into being in the wrong. Pretending that his dislike of hiking, and your tendency to literally vomit during bumpy rides, are the same thing, and he overcame one so you should overcome the other, is wilful misrepresentation designed to mess with your head and make you feel like a bad person. \n\nI have a lot of food intolerances and when my ex was trying to check out of the relationship to get with the friend he told me not to worry about, instead of *communicating*, he suddenly became obsessed with eating out at really fancy restaurants with rich flavourful foods that I couldn\u2019t eat (you know, octopus, ostrich, not your average menu where I can usually find something), and complained that he wanted a partner who could share his favourite pastimes. He also misrepresented me as \u2018not leaving my comfort zone\u2019 for him when that would have entailed vomiting on the bathroom floor for 3 days at a time.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool that you went for the hike first with the supposed promise that you\u2019d then do his activity, but quite honestly, I suspect you were hesitant to really put your foot down, because he is quite prone to sulking if he doesn\u2019t get his way, and you don\u2019t want to confront the fact that you shouldn\u2019t actually have to tell your husband that you can\u2019t do these activities. He shouldn\u2019t be pressuring you into something that will make you sick. He shouldn\u2019t have chosen, as the only activities he was willing to do, things that would make you sick. That is not good husband behaviour.\n\nAll of these singletons in the comments going \u2018you didn\u2019t even try\u2019 have no concept of illness and would have called a woman controlling for trying to get a man to do something that made him sick. Please do not take them to heart. Do not believe your husband. Do not let him change reality. You did not \u2018refuse to leave your comfort zone\u2019. You were unable to do something because you would get sick. Ask him why things that would make you sick are suddenly so important to him that he\u2019d ruin your holiday.", "NTA", "NTA.

It should go without saying that the selected activities should be reasonable choices and that making you literally, physically sick is not a reasonable choice.", "NTA, you shouldn't be expected to make yourself sick to keep things even. He knew you wouldn't go before he went on the hike, or he would have if he listened to you.", "YTA. For making him do your activity knowing you didn't want to do his. I agree with an earlier commenter that you did not plan your trip well. Next time make sure all activities are agreed on, if he ever takes a vacation with you again.

Thats hella mean of him to expect you to do something you physically can\u2019t do versus him not \u201cpreferring\u201d hiking. This is crazy. He can go on his own or choose something else y\u2019all can actually do together even if it\u2019s not your favorite thing. People here are taking the \u201cdeal\u201d way too seriously. I\u2019m sure you just meant for each of you to research and decide on one thing each you both can reasonably do together. That doesn\u2019t mean there are no limits or conditions. Wth lol. Heres a real example of a compromise. I am not very food adventurous and my partner is. He wanted me to try some things I normally wouldn\u2019t try. I did not want to but I did because I was capable of it and it would make him happy to order a plate he didn\u2019t have to finish himself.

We stayed at an all-inclusive resort but we also wanted to get out and actually explore the island as well.  So we decided that each of us could pick an activity to do that would get us off the resort for a day.  I picked a hike that would bring us up into the mountainous interior of the island and through some rainforests. My husband is not a big hiker, but he agreed to do it with me.  My husband narrowed his choices down to two options, a catamaran trip to go snorkeling and dune buggy riding.\n\nI get horrible motion sickness.  We had some mild turbulence on our flight to the island and even with the Dramamine I took before we took off, I still got nauseous and lightheaded. I told my husband that both of the ideas he picked are things that I know for a fact would make me motion sick.  He told me that it probably wouldn't be that bad but I told him that I know my body and I know without a doubt that both of those activities would make me sick.  I asked him if there were any other activities that he was interested in, but he said those 2 were the only ones that piqued his interest.  \n\nHe eventually agreed to go on the hike trip first and then we can figure out the activity that he wants to do.  While on our hike we started talking with another couple that was also staying at our resort.  They had been there a couple of times before and my husband asked if they had done either of the activities that he wanted to do.  They had done both and said that both were a lot of fun.  But the wife did say that the catamaran trip was pretty rough at times and a couple of people on their trip got seasick.  She also said that the dune buggy was fun because you get to drive it yourself, but it's mostly on dirt tracks that can get pretty bumpy.\n\nFrom the way she described it, I knew that if I did either of those things, I would get sick.  When we got back from the hike, I told my husband that I don't want to do either of the activities he wants to do and asked again if he can please pick something else for us to do.  He said those were the only 2 things he liked, and if I don't want to do them, we won't because he doesn't want to go alone.\n\nI knew he was upset because he was really excited talking about both the things he wanted to do and after I told him I wouldn't do them, his demeanor definitely changed.  I wouldn't say he was sulking, but he was definitely less animated and not his usual fun self.  He pretty much spent the rest of our trip just sitting around the pool doing nothing.  I tried to get him to do things with me, like get a massage, but he told me to go do that myself.\n\nWhen he didn't change his attitude I finally asked him what was up and he told me that he went outside of his comfort zone to go on a hike with me, but I wouldn't do the same for him.  I told him that hiking doesn't make him sick so that's a big difference but he told me I could have at least tried one of them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you were so not willing to do what he wanted, then why did you have him agree to do what you wanted? It would have been safer to find something you both could partially enjoy instead of something only one person wanted.

It was not! More like 90 minutes of mountain roads, speeding up and slamming on brakes.  I was so sick by the time we arrived that I was seriously considering walking back to the hotel.  I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.  I understand the spouse being disappointed, but I also see the OP\u2019s POV.   NAH.", "Seems like she didn't know that until during/after the hike: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He eventually agreed to go on the hike trip first and then we can figure out the activity that he wants to do.", "Same. The patch has been a miracle for me on our vacations. My husband doesn\u2019t get motion sick at all and I have been able to hang with most things he\u2019s wanted to do because of it, even though I vomit at the idea of being on a boat. Sometimes you just gotta suck it up and try!", "I am also an individual who gets motion sick pretty easily. Do you feel like the bracelets and magnets have been helpful?

I\u2019ll say it now and I\u2019ll say it again", "No, it means she can backtrack to the resort very slowly.  And hubby could continue on.\n\nAlso, many resorts will match people who are alone up with another.  Perhaps some other person would be willing to go with her husband.", "Yeah, this is the part about OP\u2019s story that confuses me. I am also quite prone to motion sickness, but have never gotten motion sickness as the driver, only as a passenger. I think the same is true for most people with motion sickness. I don\u2019t know how OP could be so utterly sure she would get sick if she was the one driving the dune buggy without trying it.", "I get motion sickness while driving also. Depends on the car and terrain. Rough terrain driving would give it to me 100%.\n\nI can dope myself to avoid motion sickness (for example for a long distance ferry trip), but then it's incompatible with driving.", "So you planned a trip with things you wanted to do with nothing he wanted to do, and he needs to wait half a decade to maybe have a chance to do something he wants to do...\n\nSorry, but yta", "Wow, you do realise how selfish and insensitive this came across ...you got to do your fun activity and didn't even attempt his. I would have been peeved and discouraged especially if vacays like that are done every 4-5 years.", "Yep you are a total YTA!!  Selfish!", "I\u2019ve been looking for somebody to say this! I\u2019ve tried every remedy for my motion sickness, nothing works. Once I start feeling nauseous nothing will even stop it, either. I could be lying down perfectly still in the dark with no phone or any stimulation, and I\u2019ll still be feeling the effects very strongly. It doesn\u2019t just go away when you stop moving. It\u2019s miserable. I can\u2019t even play certain video games because of it.", "What are you talking about?? There is non-drowsy Dramamine.", "Then they should have dropped both activities and done something they both enjoyed instead of her taking him on a hike she knew he didn't enjoy when she had no intention on holding up her end of the deal.", "Then I would hope that, knowing you have a debilitating reaction to a vast number of activities that most people can cope with, you wouldn't make a deal forcing your spouse to do something you don't love, knowing you had stict vetos on so many other things.", "They should have accepted that there are some things OP can't do. Wrt motion sickness, sometimes I almost get it, just watching videos in my reddit feed.\n\nNTA", "Dune buggy he would drive she would be the passenger.", "I have motion sickness so bad I\u2019ve had to leave movie theatres when there\u2019s too much shaky camera work. \n\nNever been able to read in moving vehicles. \n\nShe could have drove herself (for whatever reason that helps with motion sickness) and tried the dune buggy because you can turn around and/or take breaks if needed. It\u2019s not a full commitment. No one is saying she had to suffer, but she didn\u2019t even try.", "How many people do you know that get motion sick \\*driving\\*? That's the only time I don't get motion sick. I get very motion sick, have since I was a kid, like puking on the side of the road motion sick. If he's driving the buggy, she should take some medication and suck it up for a couple hours.", "BS.   I get motion sickness badly but I pre plan.  Those bracelets are a godsend and they work extremely well.   She didn\u2019t even try.   But question?  You get motion sick but could fly to the tropical island no problem???   So again I call bull crap.   Selfish and a horrible partner in my opinion", "That\u2019s still not an excuse as she wouldn\u2019t be forced to drive. Those dune buggy companies have options so a family can go together. He would do all the driving.", "I don't have motion sickness and from what I've read in the comment thread  it sounds absolutely terrible, so I'm not going to comment on that aspect. The fact that OP made her spouse do something he didn't want to do knowing she wasn't/couldn't reciprocate is what bothers me. They could have mutually agreed on different activities that would be comfortable and enjoyable for both of them. I also feel like the husband was being stubborn just because she made go on a hike. \nI'm going with ESH", "I feel like if op had any of these thing or if any of them worked for her she would've stated it. The bracelets may work for you but not for her, she also may not have the spare cash to buy those bracelets and get them in time to do these activities. She said the medicine she usually takes barely even worked for her on the trip to the resort, to expect her to put herself into physical pain and feeling nausea to the point of being sick is horrendous. People keep complaining about how it wouldn't be fair to the husband but how is that fair in the first place. \"We do something I like but you don't really care for and in return we'll do something you like that makes me start throwing up and basically miserable.\"", "He could ride up ahead and come back while she took her time. Kinda like walking an energetic dog off a leash: he\u2019ll run ahead and then come back. A lot of those trails run in loops and if there are actual dunes, there\u2019s plenty of space to roam around in sight. She made no effort to compromise. YTA.", "I've had motion sickness since I was a child. It's the smoother rides that would upset me. The rough rides, where I can feel the ground almost through bumps etc, I don't get sick on. I love roller coasters. I would imagine I would be fine on ATVs.", "I took the patch before, go figure, going on a catamaran and snorkeling trip in Hawaii! It actually did work wonders. I still felt a little queasy by the end of it because the waters were pretty rough but impressively I didn\u2019t get sick at all, and I\u2019m someone who gets motion sick on any mode of travel: planes, cars, and *especially* boats.", "I get the blurry vision after taking them off, I have to use reading glasses. Still worth it but a good to know side effects!", "I see it as a form of disability and should be treated as such. Why ruin a day of her vacation?", "Yes. No where do i see that she agreed to do something and back out. She repeatedly said she cannot do these and asked him to pick something else. She agreed to do a thing, but explicitly not those things.", "The husband didn't vomit on the hike, nor did she force him to go, or trick him. She gave him ample opportunities to come up with things he wanted to do, he only wanted to do two things she could not do. Then he refused to do them without her. Basically he feels like because he went along with her, she should do whatever he wants, even if it makes her sick. That's absolutely terrible.", "If OP is truly THAT sensitive to motion and the sickness is THAT debilitating, then frankly she shouldn\u2019t have proposed/agreed to this plan or vacation in the first place. Or at least there should\u2019ve been a clearer discussion in advance.\n\nShe went to a beach vacation, planned to take turns choosing excursions, and then later said \u201coh but I can\u2019t do anything on the water or anything involving any kind of vehicles\u201d. There goes like 70% of beach/island excursions. \n\nIt was really unfair to set up misleading expectations for OP\u2019s partner", "Comparing motion sickness to a deadly allergy is super gross imo. Nobody dies from motion sickness. And you and OP are ignoring the fact that one of the options was much more controllable. She should have tried a short buggy ride and if it got bad they can stop. But she decided the deal was over once she got what she wanted and that's not right.", "Or just, you know, keep your promises. The problem here is the attitude. She didn't KNOW the buggy ride would make her sick. She assumed it. And she also let him go on the hike with the full knowledge that she had no intention of doing his activity. She didn't even make it far enough to see what it would be like. They could have just tried a slow loop in a smooth area to keep her promise and if she felt unwell, stop. If she's sick enough that she knows with absolute certainty every single vehicle at every speed will make her violently ill - get off the tropical island and see a doctor.", "It's not about the motion sickness for me anymore. She lied to him to get him to do her activity and played the victim when he was disappointed she lied to him. That's asshole behavior regardless of the illness.", "Like sure, but they\u2019re married and he presumably knows about her motion sickness? It\u2019s incredibly bizarre to me that the husband chose activities he KNEW his wife couldn\u2019t do. I am terrified of heights and my partner doesn\u2019t care about heights but he would never choose an activity like high ropes that he would enjoy because he knows it would be a hell no from me. Or he would do it himself.", "Explain to me where the deceit occurred. It seemed like the husband agreed to the plan, then simply repeated his insistence on the same two activities. Sounds to me like he was being deceitful.", "It also flat out doesn't work if your motion sickness is severe enough. I take 2 before I go on amusement park rides and still spend half the day with my head in a public toilet", "No she just should never have made this deal to begin with.  She knew she wouldn't be able to do his activities so they shouldn't have done the hike either.  They should have found something they would both have enjoyed.", "I don't see where OP suggested this, is it in a comment somewhere? The husband tells OP to go alone to massages in the last paragraph, but I don't see them asking husband if he is ok doing his activity alone.\n\n\nEDIT: I see it now, my bad.", "No. *He* needs therapy because he's so disrespectful of the boundaries that she needs for her physical health that he gave her an attitude and refused to do anything with her as punishment. I'm sure if she caved and tried, he'd have changed his attitude. That's emotional abuse.", "I said RX meds.  More effective than dramamine..", "Well then I would definitely say NTA. You gave him the opportunity to have fun and you not get sick. I'm not sure what else he expects from you here.", "My husband gets extremely motion sick. We have tried everything from over the counter meds to weird gadgets like those glasses filled with liquid and prescription medications, but they don\u2019t make a huge difference.

Doesn't matter about her motion sickness here, she likely pressed until he just said \"alright\"", "The dirt tracks part makes me think it's more of a set of tracks where you can rent buggies and drive them around predetermined courses at your leisure.\n\nLike an oversized go cart place", "Omg what a nightmare! I get petechiae, which is generally harmless, but man , new fear unlocked!", "Refusing to do something you don\u2019t want to do doesn\u2019t make you an AH", "He hadn\u2019t even decided what his thing was at that point. He had two potential activities, both of which she told him would make her sick", "\u201cMy husband is not a big hiker but he agreed to do it\u201d based on this he agreed to go without making a big fuss or needing much convincing if any at all \n\n\u201cHe eventually agreed to go in the hike trip first and then we can figure out the activity he wants to do\u201d based on This the \u2018eventually\u2019 was not in reference to the hiking but to the order of events and final decision making. If anything was coerced it was tabling the discussion until after the hike \n\nI\u2019m not defending coercion I\u2019m saying that unless there is abuse in the relationship we are not aware of he is an adult that made a decision and he could have at any point changed his mind or even could have said no from the beginning and he would not have been an AH for doing so. I would in fact support him saying no to hiking even if the reason was a simple as he just doesn\u2019t like it. If this post was asking if OP was the AH for pushing him to go hiking even when he said he didn\u2019t want to my verdict would be different but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. \n\nOP refusing to do either of the two activities does not make them an AH. OP refusing even after he agreed to go hiking when he doesn\u2019t really care for hiking still does not make them an AH. OP picking hiking when he doesn\u2019t like hiking does not make them an AH. If there\u2019s more to the story here that you can show me with further details about the coercion I\u2019ll gladly look at that and take it into consideration but based on the post I\u2019m going with NTA \n\nAlso you\u2019re on Reddit reading posts and going through comments and responding to comments so ig us redditors really are something else but I\u2019m no more of a redditor than you \ud83d\ude02", "You\u2019re reaching into the ether to pull out that pressure because it\u2019s not mentioned in the actual post. From experience sometimes people agree to do things they don\u2019t like without being pressured at all. I\u2019m not going to assume that he had to be poked and prodded into agreeing to hiking when it wasn\u2019t mentioned", "I know right? That's why I use meds. It was on/after a flight so perhaps changes in air pressure were a factor too?"]}
