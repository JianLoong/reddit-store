I was until I was about 13. But that changed. He either only realized it now or only started to care now that I'm living a more independent life and he's not as involved as he wants to be.\n\nI was 8 when I lost my mom and we were as close as ever but I needed him more. Then when I was 11 he remarried and he became a stepdad to a girl who was 10 at the time. Now, this is where full honesty comes in. I was jealous as hell that my dad was trying to bond with her and that he called her his daughter and us \"his girls\" right away. It made me feel less special. It made me feel like I didn't matter as much because how could someone so new to him be equal to me after hardly any time. Every time he spent time with her I felt sick. He still spent time with me but after about six or seven months of marriage, he started to spend more time with his stepdaughter. I hated it. I was both devastated and furious that she was getting my dad.\n\nI was 13 my dad said how much he preferred hanging out with her over me because they had similar interests. He said he couldn't spend enough time with his stepdaughter and he was hoping I would hit the teen phase of not wanting my parents around me that much. He didn't say it to me but I heard him say it. His best friend was one of the people he did say it to and he was like dude, don't say that out loud and my dad said most parents probably feel that way. He said it wasn't like he would ever tell me that to my face. Then he admitted he also resented me for not wanting his wife the way her daughter wanted him. He wanted us to be the perfect little family and we looked like a stepfamily where the step is always used because I didn't really want his wife for stuff.\n\nI gave him his wish and over the years he increased the amount of time he spent with his stepdaughter. They could do stuff together up to four times a week. That was until she was 16 and wanted space. He was devastated by that and that crushed me. So I decided that was all I needed to know and didn't try to get closer to him.\n\nHe approached me with the question of why after I moved in with my boyfriend and his dad helped us move stuff. My dad said he expected to be called and then he asked me why I had pulled away from him. So I told him everything from the jealousy to what I heard him say and I told him I decided that I wasn't going to keep close like I had when he felt that way. Dad was offended that I had ever been jealous. He told me it was disgusting to want to deny his stepdaughter the chance at a dad. He also told me he should be allowed to have interests in common with someone other than me. I told him he was. But I was also a kid who lost my mom and clung to my sole living parent. He then accused me of manipulating him by saying all that and I told him that he shouldn't have asked a question if he wasn't prepared for an honest answer. He told me I could fuck right off with that attitude and told me to grow up.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699204680, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ogn70/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_he_shouldnt_have/", "score": 4387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Either way, the result of his behavior was that he pushed you away to deal with your emotions all on your own.

The fact that he didn\u2019t see that was happening to you and didn\u2019t take steps to make sure you felt cared for, loved, and secure in your relationship to him even as he tried to connect with the stepdaughter is such a loss to you and to him. \n\nYour dad\u2019s response to hearing all of this  is also just appalling, that he had no sympathy with how you felt as a little girl, couldn\u2019t see how his choices affected you, and instead focused on defending himself is really shitty. \n\nYou are NTA, op, and I think all you can do is continue to build your own strong relationships and create a family of choice that treat you with more love and compassion.

His friend was right in telling him never to voice something like that out loud as you heard it. Of course, you are going to be hurt. Expressing hurt feelings is not manipulative. You were his daughter mourning her mother and the loss of a more distant father. He's either clueless, totally insensitive or trying to push his guilt back on you. He should feel guilty.

I appreciate disclosing the jealousy part, it helps see who you are and where this all comes from. He said to fuck off so cut him off completely is my opinion!", "NTA. Not even a little bit. \n\nParents are human and we make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes are big ones and we unintentionally hurt our kids. I\u2019ve certainly made some big mistakes. But a good parent apologizes and takes accountability. I made one major doozy of a mistake with my kids. I didn\u2019t listen when they told me some things about my parents. Harm was done. Once I realized how badly I messed up I got them away from my parents for good. I could have made excuses. I was a single mom at the time working a full time job, a part time job, and private teaching on the side, just to make ends meet. I couldn\u2019t afford to pay for daycare and my mom watching them for free seemed like a blessing. But she wasn\u2019t being good to them. I should have listened and didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the bottom line. My kids were hurt due to choices I made and nothing else matters.  That\u2019s on me. So I got them away. I apologized. I took us to therapy. I did the work to rebuild a trusting relationship with my kids. \n\nYour dad didn\u2019t do that. Perhaps he was overwhelmed with grief. Perhaps he lost sight of your needs in that grief. Who knows. But at the end of the day he was the parent and it was his job to notice you were pulling away and do the work necessary to heal himself and his relationship with you. He didn\u2019t do that.

It is absolutely natural for you to feel slighted when he jumped on the Step-dad train with both feet and put your step sister on the same pedestal you had all to yourself up until then. He wasn't *necessarily* wrong for doing so either, (as she was also a child and should feel welcome in the family) but as *your* parent, he should have been more mindful of you and how you reacted to it - he's all you had, and you should've been more of a priority to him. \n\nWhat you overheard him say was *awful*. It wasn't wrong for him to connect with your step sister more on some things - you can't help what you like, and it's natural to want to do those things with others who share that interest.

Would you have been able to accept his divided attention if it was your real sibling? Because I do kind of agree with him also tbh, that girl also deserves a father.

Your jealousy is understansable but not entirely fair. But everything after that is a huge AH move by him. He pushed you away and only came crawling back after the special child wanted space. His attitude was to blame you and make you feel bad to guilt you into coming back. His attitude should have been to ackowledge he hurt you and pushed you away and beg you to forgive him.

I wasn't one of her two perfect kids. She wouldn't even teach me to drive because; \"I've already taught my kids\" and this is after she's been in my life for over 6+ years. My husband taught me how to drive when I was 21. As I got older my dad pulled away from me. We were once SUPER close. and then after I married the sexual abuse I suffered at age 11 came out and he pulled away completely from me (which is why i had never told him). I am 36 now and our relationship has never recovered and it hurts.\n\nThe chances of you ever having a close relationship to your dad... is slim to none which I'm sure you've already figured out.

I wasn't going to put in the practice time I would need to to play at the high school and university level. He basically stopped having a relationship with me. A few years later my mom started drinking and he leaned pretty hard on me to manage that/parent, so we got \"close\" again. When my sister was at university and really unhappy with her coach/team dynamics, I told her that she didn't have to play if she didn't want to. She told me that she was terrified of her relationship with dad evaporating like mine had in junior high (I had never discussed that with her, him or anyone else) and jealous that he talked to me about \"real\" stuff even though she knew it sucked for me.\n\nWhen I got a lot of therapy and some good friends and started setting some boundaries with my dad, he basically dropped me again.

Iiwiys, I wouldn't even bother to hit back and tell him to fuck off himself. I'll just disappear. He doesn't deserve your emotional labor. I can already see how he can remain just as shitty as a grandfather should you and your stepsister eventually have your own kids.  \n\nVery sorry for how things turned out, hope you find peace if you decide to go NC from this egomaniac, and continued support from your bf and his family.", "NTA, time to go NC as you already figure out you don't want his friendship as he didn't fulfil his role as a parent.

Your dad's a narcissist.", "NTA, but what I think is really going on was your dad didn\u2019t want to deal with any rough parenting and especially feelings, so he just avoided you all together. Your stepsister got the attention cuz she was easy. I\u2019m sure he knew all along you had negative feelings but it was easier to pretend everything was fine and you would just magically have a change of heart, that was impossible because he never let you express this when it counted. Things may have been different if there had been some discussion. Your dad sounds like he gets defensive as soon as you point out something that he could have done better and turns into a problem you had, not something he failed to do. Hopefully he will reflect and try to make amends.", "NTA.

Your Dad surely is.  I think you should let him know what you heard him tell his best friend. You were a kid who just lost her Mom and was grieving. You overheard your Dad effectively say he did not prefer you over the new kid. WTAH?!  He was happy to move on and leave both your Mom's memory and you behind for his new family.  What he needs to understand is that he abandoned you long ago and even voiced this to his best friend and you heard it.  You have in fact grown up with little support after the death of your mother, and you were only fulfilling his desire to spend more time with her in place of you since you knew he preferred her over you after hearing what he said. Now, you've moved on because he has a daughter he prefers and you are now seeking to have the love in your life that you deserve and don't have to feel bad about asking for.  And he can fuck right the heck off until he gets how much he's messed up here.  And even then, you may or may not allow him to be a part of your life.  You deserve better than what he's dealing out.  \n\n\nI only suggest that you make it exquisitely clear all of the above (maybe even write it down in a letter and send it certified, so you know he got it) for your own sake of unloading all that trauma for him to deal with and you can get on with the rest of your life never leaving unsaid what you would want him to understand about your distance from him, and your anger towards him.  If he's any kind of man he will get the message and attempt to understand and apologize.

Just throws blame at you for something he fucked up", "NTA. That had to be incredibly painful to go through (both then & now). You deserved a dad who wouldn't make it so easy to distance yourself. A person who would notice the distance.

He isnt redeemable.", "No way in the world are you the asshole he should be on his knees begging for your forgiveness and you should deny him, at least at first.

He is still your father just not a priority in your life anymore. He made that decision not you.", "NTA. A father who cared would have reacted with remorse, guilt, horror that you had overheard that and that his actions had caused you so much pain. That he tried to turn it around on you is utterly despicable. Whatever excuse he might have been able to come up with for his behavior as a child (grief over your mother, ignorance, whatever), he's shown his true colors now. I know it's a reddit cliche, but OP, it's time to go NC with your father, for your own mental health.", "The people I know who lost parents as children were profoundly affected throughout their young adulthood, well into their 30\u2019s. It is such a devastating and unnatural loss. Much greater for you than the loss your father went through. \n\nThe sad thing here is you are now effectively losing your father, too. Despite his being a clueless bastard he\u2019s the only parent you\u2019ve got. He should have waited longer to marry, but for you no amount of time may ever have been long enough. His attitude of wanting to take the new step daughter in fully was good, that\u2019s how we want step-parents to treat their new kids. It\u2019s so unfortunate that he couldn\u2019t assist you in your pain, and seems like he turned a blind eye to it. Some people are just incapable of dealing with other\u2019s emotional pain - sometimes you have to recognize their limitations. That you also shunned your step mother might indicate that you were pretty unreachable. have you tried therapy? good luck going forward. Perhaps you\u2019ll find all the family you need in your new relationships.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, this obviously hurt you deeply.", "NTA\n\nHe fucked around and found out.

I think what you said was very thoughtful and took a lot of self reflection and courage to admit. You were a CHILD, and like you said you were a child who lost a parent and clung onto your only other living parent who was ready to move on and create a whole new family so quickly. It\u2019s a bit hypocritical of your dad to call you disgusting for admitting you were jealous (a natural human emotion) but he doesn\u2019t find it disgusting that he wished you wouldn\u2019t want to spend time with him so he can spend more time with someone who isn\u2019t even his biological child? I think it\u2019s selfish on his part to have never sat you down and talk to you about the changing family dynamic. I find this situation more common in men who remarry and get step children. They always seem to try to overcompensate the love for their step children and forget about their own, I think they do this in an effort to keep the new wife happy and don\u2019t realize the emotional toll it takes on their own kid. Sorry to say this but you lost two parents, your mom when she died and your dad when he remarried and you don\u2019t deserve that.", "NTA - His friend already told him he was out of line saying that and now he has to admit to being a bad father or blame you. He is taking the cowards way out and trying to shift the blame to you, Only thing people like him understand is a good old public shaming so they can't hide behind their pretend version of reality.\n\nI mean honestly what's he gonna do, Be a worse father because it would be hard to outdo himself at this point.", "NTA.  You were a kid dealing with the loss of your mom and at least what appeared to be the loss of your dad too.

A dad and a daughters bond is so sacred and to watch that be stolen is one of the most gut wrenching feelings. Unfortunately it seems nowadays anytime you tell someone how you feel you are \u201cmanipulating them\u201d. You were a sad, scared kid who needed her dad and unfortunately he didn\u2019t see that at the time and moved on. No matter how strong or smart your kids are they are still kids people!", "NTA.

I cannot imagine that he doesn\u2019t understand that at that tender age and as a single parent, he was the center of your existence and purpose and he decided to pull away to give someone else a dad.\n\nI am having a high respect for the way you handled this thing.

Bonding with both to as great of an extent as possible and helping them bond with each other. \n\nAs his daughters only living parent his job is to advocate for his daughter. Sure the three of them or four could have family days together, but he needs to be sure to take individual bonding time with his child and let his wife have time with hers.\n\nNever ever say anything about wanting your child to lose interest in spending time with you, or anything negative about being with your kids, those are things that kids will be discussing with their psychologist for years. \n\nNTA - Some therapy might be in order for OP. I'm glad she has found a family of her own that loves and respects her. People should never ask questions they don't want to hear the answers too.

This OP had a conversation with her father that was almost word for word the one I had with mine as an adult. I didn't know that I was hurting when I was too young to understand it emotionally, but the time we spent together stopped very abruptly, nearly overnight when he remarried. A lot of my interests were interests BECAUSE my dad raised me with them, and would take me to concerts or road trips sometimes, and that transferred instantly to the daughters of the new wife. He spent most of his free time at her eldest daughter's house and even stole from me once because the youngest daughter needed money to cover legal fees for her third DUI, which ended up clearing out my college fund that both he and my mother started, I siphoned money into with my high school job, and other family members contributed. I was halfway through my degree, so I took out loans to finish. \n\nI hadn't addressed the distance between us before that but I decided to answer his questions as to why I never visited and withdrew completely. When I gave him the explanation up there (albeit with more detail about other things he prioritized over me in the bonding stages with the stepdaughters) he exploded and said it was pretty selfish of me to be unhappy for him for being able to enjoy his \"new life,\" and that he was unable to help that I was a thread that connected him to the one that made him unhappy. I told him that I would have been perfectly willing to start that new chapter with him and find the happiness he had together but he didn't want me included from the very beginning of it, which made me unhappy. I thought my life and connection to my dad was amazing and did not have any bitter exchanges with him aside from the typical kid stuff because we enjoyed every minute of the time we spent together. If my feelings toward him bum him out, then he has to accept some responsibility for creating that distance in the first place.\n\nAfter a lot of therapy and conversations with other women who similarly experienced their father's shift to the new family, I learned that this is a societal issue that is unfortunately... not common, but patterned. It really does come down to your first point about the emotional immaturity, but the father really does feel resentment or discomfort toward that thread that connected them to either a painful failure or a death of a spouse. They prefer the hedonostic chase of ONLY GOOD THINGS!!! and unfortunately for the daughter, they are no longer in that category by virtue of being part of the past. \n\nOP's dad could have found commonalities at that period of her life even if they were vastly different people, and fathers with healthy grips on nurturing and parenthood can do this with biological or step-children.
