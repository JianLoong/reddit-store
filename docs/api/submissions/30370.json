I was until I was about 13. But that changed. He either only realized it now or only started to care now that I'm living a more independent life and he's not as involved as he wants to be.\n\nI was 8 when I lost my mom and we were as close as ever but I needed him more. Then when I was 11 he remarried and he became a stepdad to a girl who was 10 at the time. Now, this is where full honesty comes in. I was jealous as hell that my dad was trying to bond with her and that he called her his daughter and us \"his girls\" right away. It made me feel less special. It made me feel like I didn't matter as much because how could someone so new to him be equal to me after hardly any time. Every time he spent time with her I felt sick. He still spent time with me but after about six or seven months of marriage, he started to spend more time with his stepdaughter. I hated it. I was both devastated and furious that she was getting my dad.\n\nI was 13 my dad said how much he preferred hanging out with her over me because they had similar interests. He said he couldn't spend enough time with his stepdaughter and he was hoping I would hit the teen phase of not wanting my parents around me that much. He didn't say it to me but I heard him say it. His best friend was one of the people he did say it to and he was like dude, don't say that out loud and my dad said most parents probably feel that way. He said it wasn't like he would ever tell me that to my face. Then he admitted he also resented me for not wanting his wife the way her daughter wanted him. He wanted us to be the perfect little family and we looked like a stepfamily where the step is always used because I didn't really want his wife for stuff.\n\nI gave him his wish and over the years he increased the amount of time he spent with his stepdaughter. They could do stuff together up to four times a week. That was until she was 16 and wanted space. He was devastated by that and that crushed me. So I decided that was all I needed to know and didn't try to get closer to him.\n\nHe approached me with the question of why after I moved in with my boyfriend and his dad helped us move stuff. My dad said he expected to be called and then he asked me why I had pulled away from him. So I told him everything from the jealousy to what I heard him say and I told him I decided that I wasn't going to keep close like I had when he felt that way. Dad was offended that I had ever been jealous. He told me it was disgusting to want to deny his stepdaughter the chance at a dad. He also told me he should be allowed to have interests in common with someone other than me. I told him he was. But I was also a kid who lost my mom and clung to my sole living parent. He then accused me of manipulating him by saying all that and I told him that he shouldn't have asked a question if he wasn't prepared for an honest answer. He told me I could fuck right off with that attitude and told me to grow up.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699204680, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ogn70/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_he_shouldnt_have/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know why he did that.  Maybe he's just a shitty person, or maybe he had some serious grief issues that he never dealt with.  Either way, the result of his behavior was that he pushed you away to deal with your emotions all on your own.

He is a rubbish father.", "NTA\n\nYou need to go full no contact with your dad. He really isn't a real dad.

This wound needs to heal. And why you can heal by yourself, maybe when you feel strong enough, try reaching out to him again and have a heart-to-heart conversation. Not accusatory.

I\u2019m so sorry you experienced that as a kid, and I can\u2019t imagine how painful it was to hear your dad say those things. It\u2019s also so sad that his comments took such deep root and created a feedback loop that kept separating you further as you grew. \n\nIt\u2019s especially sad bc while I can certainly understand why he would want to build a good relationship with his stepdaughter, it never needed to come at the expense of your own sense of security and love from him. The fact that he didn\u2019t see that was happening to you and didn\u2019t take steps to make sure you felt cared for, loved, and secure in your relationship to him even as he tried to connect with the stepdaughter is such a loss to you and to him. \n\nYour dad\u2019s response to hearing all of this  is also just appalling, that he had no sympathy with how you felt as a little girl, couldn\u2019t see how his choices affected you, and instead focused on defending himself is really shitty. \n\nYou are NTA, op, and I think all you can do is continue to build your own strong relationships and create a family of choice that treat you with more love and compassion. Don\u2019t let your dad convince you that you are wrong to be honest or wrong to have expected better and different from him.", "NTA, your dad is and a very immature one at that. His friend was right in telling him never to voice something like that out loud as you heard it. Of course, you are going to be hurt. Expressing hurt feelings is not manipulative. You were his daughter mourning her mother and the loss of a more distant father. He's either clueless, totally insensitive or trying to push his guilt back on you. He should feel guilty. Wanting to bond with his stepdaughter is fine, but it doesn't have to be at the expense of pushing you away. Honestly, he sounds so freacking immature. He's the one that needs to grow up.", "NTA - The best parent takes interest in what their kids are interested in, and stay involved, even if they don't like what it is.  \n\nHe failed.

I'm sorry you have such a self-centered and insensitive AH for a Dad.  He didn't even take a second to try and (emphasize)  with the little girl you were at the time.  Instead, he became defensive and torpedoed what you had to say, then attempted to dismiss it by telling you to grow up.  Well, thanks to his less than stellar parenting, you outgrew him and you're better off for it.

The jealousy part sucks, but to be completely expected. It happens even to  bio siblings when they are young. From the point that you overheard his conversations about not wanting to spend time with you makes him a complete asshole that abandoned his grieving daughter. I appreciate disclosing the jealousy part, it helps see who you are and where this all comes from. He said to fuck off so cut him off completely is my opinion!", "NTA. Not even a little bit. \n\nParents are human and we make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes are big ones and we unintentionally hurt our kids. I\u2019ve certainly made some big mistakes. But a good parent apologizes and takes accountability. I made one major doozy of a mistake with my kids. I didn\u2019t listen when they told me some things about my parents. Harm was done. Once I realized how badly I messed up I got them away from my parents for good. I could have made excuses. I was a single mom at the time working a full time job, a part time job, and private teaching on the side, just to make ends meet. I couldn\u2019t afford to pay for daycare and my mom watching them for free seemed like a blessing. But she wasn\u2019t being good to them. I should have listened and didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the bottom line. My kids were hurt due to choices I made and nothing else matters.  That\u2019s on me. So I got them away. I apologized. I took us to therapy. I did the work to rebuild a trusting relationship with my kids. \n\nYour dad didn\u2019t do that. Perhaps he was overwhelmed with grief. Perhaps he lost sight of your needs in that grief. Who knows. But at the end of the day he was the parent and it was his job to notice you were pulling away and do the work necessary to heal himself and his relationship with you. He didn\u2019t do that. And he went further by blaming you for the consequences of his actions. You can absolve yourself of any blame in this situation and take whatever measures you find necessary to protect yourself.", "NTA. Your father sounds like he's not willing to take responsibility for his own actions. He also lacked and continues to lack empathy for his own daughter. I hope you can have the relationship with him that you want, whatever that is, but the way he is, he needs to do a lot of growing.", "Your NTA. I would limit contact with your sperm donor though.

He will still drop you lime a soft turd if the golden stepdaughter wants him.\n\nYou are far more mature than he will ever be, and he can give you nothing but irritation.  \n\nIf there is a stone in your shoe, you don't leave it there and hope it will stop hurting you. You remove it and toss it aside, then walk away feeling so much better.", "NTA. There is no point in explaining yourself to your dad at all, i think he would not take any answers where he is in the wrong. Just tell him since you guys don't have anything in common, you don't look forward to build any common interest either.The nerve of some people.", "NTA. Your dad might be a decent stepdad but he was and is a shitty dad and doesn't deserve your time and energy now that he's feeling lonely.

Your father is a monster.", "It won't hurt me even worse. I lost him forever the second he showed real sadness and upset that his stepdaughter wanted space for him when he never showed that when I stopped. That was the moment I knew there was never going to be a good relationship between us.\n\nAnd I was 13 when I realized I could never rely on him for anything. He would just resent me for needing him.", "Yeah, I know at the time it was worse because young me just couldn't be okay with the fact he was treating a kid who wasn't his the same as me, and working so hard on their relationship. I reached an understanding about that in recent years. But the whole picture just makes me realize he stepped up for her and dropped me when I still needed him more than anything.", "It feels like that now. At the time she passed I still felt like I had a great dad. I adored him and he was my whole world after mom died. That's what made the whole thing more crushing.", "You certainly know better, I\u2019m just an internet stranger.\nIn any case, I would suggest to find a therapist to talk about it. There are ways to deal with this emotional pain instead of just carrying it around. They can help you offload it and find piece within yourself.\n\nIf not healed, he\u2019ll keep hurting you from within. \nTook me years to forgive my dad and finally open my heart back to him and I certainly wasn\u2019t in such a tragic circumstances and he was a great dad overall. \n\nStill my inner child was hurt", "NTA.  Do what he told you, fuck right off.  There's no reason to contact him again.  He wouldn't even own up to his mistakes, and he tried to turn it around on you, a child at the time."]}
