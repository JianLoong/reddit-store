I was until I was about 13. But that changed. He either only realized it now or only started to care now that I'm living a more independent life and he's not as involved as he wants to be.\n\nI was 8 when I lost my mom and we were as close as ever but I needed him more. Then when I was 11 he remarried and he became a stepdad to a girl who was 10 at the time. Now, this is where full honesty comes in. I was jealous as hell that my dad was trying to bond with her and that he called her his daughter and us \"his girls\" right away. It made me feel less special. It made me feel like I didn't matter as much because how could someone so new to him be equal to me after hardly any time. Every time he spent time with her I felt sick. He still spent time with me but after about six or seven months of marriage, he started to spend more time with his stepdaughter. I hated it. I was both devastated and furious that she was getting my dad.\n\nI was 13 my dad said how much he preferred hanging out with her over me because they had similar interests. He said he couldn't spend enough time with his stepdaughter and he was hoping I would hit the teen phase of not wanting my parents around me that much. He didn't say it to me but I heard him say it. His best friend was one of the people he did say it to and he was like dude, don't say that out loud and my dad said most parents probably feel that way. He said it wasn't like he would ever tell me that to my face. Then he admitted he also resented me for not wanting his wife the way her daughter wanted him. He wanted us to be the perfect little family and we looked like a stepfamily where the step is always used because I didn't really want his wife for stuff.\n\nI gave him his wish and over the years he increased the amount of time he spent with his stepdaughter. They could do stuff together up to four times a week. That was until she was 16 and wanted space. He was devastated by that and that crushed me. So I decided that was all I needed to know and didn't try to get closer to him.\n\nHe approached me with the question of why after I moved in with my boyfriend and his dad helped us move stuff. My dad said he expected to be called and then he asked me why I had pulled away from him. So I told him everything from the jealousy to what I heard him say and I told him I decided that I wasn't going to keep close like I had when he felt that way. Dad was offended that I had ever been jealous. He told me it was disgusting to want to deny his stepdaughter the chance at a dad. He also told me he should be allowed to have interests in common with someone other than me. I told him he was. But I was also a kid who lost my mom and clung to my sole living parent. He then accused me of manipulating him by saying all that and I told him that he shouldn't have asked a question if he wasn't prepared for an honest answer. He told me I could fuck right off with that attitude and told me to grow up.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699204680, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ogn70/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_he_shouldnt_have/", "score": 2643, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Either way, the result of his behavior was that he pushed you away to deal with your emotions all on your own.

It\u2019s also so sad that his comments took such deep root and created a feedback loop that kept separating you further as you grew. \n\nIt\u2019s especially sad bc while I can certainly understand why he would want to build a good relationship with his stepdaughter, it never needed to come at the expense of your own sense of security and love from him. The fact that he didn\u2019t see that was happening to you and didn\u2019t take steps to make sure you felt cared for, loved, and secure in your relationship to him even as he tried to connect with the stepdaughter is such a loss to you and to him. \n\nYour dad\u2019s response to hearing all of this  is also just appalling, that he had no sympathy with how you felt as a little girl, couldn\u2019t see how his choices affected you, and instead focused on defending himself is really shitty. \n\nYou are NTA, op, and I think all you can do is continue to build your own strong relationships and create a family of choice that treat you with more love and compassion.

His friend was right in telling him never to voice something like that out loud as you heard it. Of course, you are going to be hurt. Expressing hurt feelings is not manipulative. You were his daughter mourning her mother and the loss of a more distant father. He's either clueless, totally insensitive or trying to push his guilt back on you. He should feel guilty.

I appreciate disclosing the jealousy part, it helps see who you are and where this all comes from. He said to fuck off so cut him off completely is my opinion!", "NTA. Not even a little bit. \n\nParents are human and we make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes are big ones and we unintentionally hurt our kids. I\u2019ve certainly made some big mistakes. But a good parent apologizes and takes accountability. I made one major doozy of a mistake with my kids. I didn\u2019t listen when they told me some things about my parents. Harm was done. Once I realized how badly I messed up I got them away from my parents for good. I could have made excuses. I was a single mom at the time working a full time job, a part time job, and private teaching on the side, just to make ends meet. I couldn\u2019t afford to pay for daycare and my mom watching them for free seemed like a blessing. But she wasn\u2019t being good to them. I should have listened and didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the bottom line. My kids were hurt due to choices I made and nothing else matters.  That\u2019s on me. So I got them away. I apologized. I took us to therapy. I did the work to rebuild a trusting relationship with my kids. \n\nYour dad didn\u2019t do that. Perhaps he was overwhelmed with grief. Perhaps he lost sight of your needs in that grief. Who knows. But at the end of the day he was the parent and it was his job to notice you were pulling away and do the work necessary to heal himself and his relationship with you. He didn\u2019t do that.

It is absolutely natural for you to feel slighted when he jumped on the Step-dad train with both feet and put your step sister on the same pedestal you had all to yourself up until then. He wasn't *necessarily* wrong for doing so either, (as she was also a child and should feel welcome in the family) but as *your* parent, he should have been more mindful of you and how you reacted to it - he's all you had, and you should've been more of a priority to him. \n\nWhat you overheard him say was *awful*. It wasn't wrong for him to connect with your step sister more on some things - you can't help what you like, and it's natural to want to do those things with others who share that interest.

Would you have been able to accept his divided attention if it was your real sibling? Because I do kind of agree with him also tbh, that girl also deserves a father.

Your jealousy is understansable but not entirely fair. But everything after that is a huge AH move by him. He pushed you away and only came crawling back after the special child wanted space. His attitude was to blame you and make you feel bad to guilt you into coming back. His attitude should have been to ackowledge he hurt you and pushed you away and beg you to forgive him.

I wasn't one of her two perfect kids. She wouldn't even teach me to drive because; \"I've already taught my kids\" and this is after she's been in my life for over 6+ years. My husband taught me how to drive when I was 21. As I got older my dad pulled away from me. We were once SUPER close. and then after I married the sexual abuse I suffered at age 11 came out and he pulled away completely from me (which is why i had never told him). I am 36 now and our relationship has never recovered and it hurts.\n\nThe chances of you ever having a close relationship to your dad... is slim to none which I'm sure you've already figured out. I'm just so sorry that you had to hear what your father said and that you had to watch him replace his difficult child.. with the \"perfect\" stepchild.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10 bucks says if you bring up what you heard him say when you were a kid he'd say; \"that was so and so years ago.. \" meaning you should .. get over it.", "OMG he's the absolute worst. \nNTA. In fact, find a way to expose him to the thread and then block all his access. He's disgusting.", "NTA, but you are being a bit childish. Grow up and realize he\u2019s as imperfect as everyone else and does dumb things for bad reasons sometimes. One day you\u2019ll realize you do the same. Give him distance but release the hate.", "NTA And I\u2019m sorry your dad is a narcissist. He doesn\u2019t deserve you in his life, and he will never have his perfect family because he\u2019s a selfish person.", "I honestly expected the story to end with the dad breaking down in tears and regrets and lots of apologies and OP telling him to f off.\n\nBut instead he doubled down and said more awful things?! Ofc OP could never be the ahole. That would break my heart all over and I would never want to see his face again.", "His best friend even told him a decade ago that his attitude wasn't okay, and he still shocked pickacu (sp??) That it affected her.", "My dad told me this about.. two years ago? It damaged what little relationship we ha left.\n\nSadly still stuck living with him, now due to his stupidity that ruined my eyesight and ability to live on my own anymore.\n\nWe don't talk, only text, despite living in the same house.\n\nPartner and I are working towards getting our lives on track, so I can leave, and never look back.\n\nIf my dad dies before then? All the more reason to never come back. Settle his affairs per his will, and gtfo.", "YUP. NTA.", "It feels a lot like OP DID fuck off with that attitude, and did grow up.\n\nHe brought it up, not her.   She never made it his problem until he asked for it.", "He can't comprehend that their lack of relationship is entirely his fault. He wants to blame OP because he is a selfish ass. OP deserves sooooo much better and better may be no dad in her life at all.", "I'm struggling to find a rational explanation for Dad's irrational behavior. There may not be one. People don't always act rational. But the way he was acting, it was almost like someone spending time with their new girlfriend; they sometimes neglect their friends and family, because they're so infatuated.\n\nOP, I don't know what your relationship with your step-sister is like, but have you considered asking her if she was groomed by your father? The sudden \"I need space\" at 16 screams that he finally attempted to cross a line, or that she woke up to the fact that he'd been crossing lines.", "I agree", "I can see that too. I find it funny that he was at least on some level jealous or felt replaced by my boyfriend's dad. Yet doesn't understand where I came from.", "He\u2019s going to have a different attitude when he is old and needs cared for and step daughter is nowhere to be found. Hopefully OP doesn\u2019t fall for it and get guilted into taking care of him.", "I had decided if I were to get married I'd ask my childhood bf dad or my uncle to walk me down the aisle.  My mom at the time declined being old school. I'd invite my dad to come but he didn't deserve that honor.", "Oh he'll be here complaining that his daughter is getting married and wants nothing to do with him, or that his first granddaughter was born and he isn't allowed to see her.", "She really wanted a dad. It made her whole life when her mom married someone who wanted to be her dad. I could see that even back then.", "Disagree.  He emotionally neglected op, and has taken zero responsibility or accountability and doubled down on being an asshole. He won\u2019t change, why should op expose themself to more neglect?   Why does ops dad think he is entitled to a relationship?", "This comment has shitty step parent wrote all over it.", "They were eight. Eight years old when they lost their mom. Of fucking course they are going to hold onto the parent they have left. And when that parents pushes them to the side line for his new family OP is smart in realizing early not to depend on him.", "I only brought it up because he asked me. I never would have said anything.", "Don\u2019t be mad? The dude deserves an ass kicking.", "It is not a child\u2019s responsibility to manage their relationship with their parent. Especially during a tumultuous time - like the death of their mother and addition of step siblings and step parents.", "I respectfully disagree.  I love that OP can see the whole picture.  In fact, that would have been the perfect time for him to apologize for his mistake of over-bonding with stepsis. Like my dad, he wouldn't own his mistakes. OP gave him an opening, and he blew it. OP can fuk off with confidence.", "She died from a chronic condition she had.", "That\u2019s a ridiculous thing to say.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

OP's dad seems shitty but not fundamentally irrational to me. \n\nMy dad is an incredibly emotionally immature dude who only wants relationships that are firmly inside his comfort zone. When I was in junior high, I told him flat out that basketball was a sport I enjoyed, but not my priority. I wasn't going to put in the practice time I would need to to play at the high school and university level. He basically stopped having a relationship with me. A few years later my mom started drinking and he leaned pretty hard on me to manage that/parent, so we got \"close\" again. When my sister was at university and really unhappy with her coach/team dynamics, I told her that she didn't have to play if she didn't want to. She told me that she was terrified of her relationship with dad evaporating like mine had in junior high (I had never discussed that with her, him or anyone else) and jealous that he talked to me about \"real\" stuff even though she knew it sucked for me.\n\nWhen I got a lot of therapy and some good friends and started setting some boundaries with my dad, he basically dropped me again. My brother has stepped into my role of emotional support human and I hate that for him, but he's a grown up who gets to make his own decisions. \n\nMy dad basically didn't have a relationship with my brother for most of his life because brother was a chill, happy go lucky nerd. He played sports but didn't mind losing, and my psychotically competitive dad could not process that or interact without getting mad, so he just fucked off. They're connecting now because a) Dad needs someone and b) my brother bought a couple of Strato games (essentially, sports themed Dungeons and Dragons, dad grew up on the baseball) and they have a weekly Strato night.\n\nSo to me, the sudden \"I need space\" at 16 screams a very normal devdlopmental stage of wanting your own identity and no longer catering to an emotionally illiterate adult man. I don't want to say that dudes like this are super common, but they're not that rare either. It's pretty notmal for men not to value or prioritize socialization outside of their romantic relationship/family and when you do that, you don't learn to accomodate other people and their interests/needs.\n\nIt's not impossible that you're right and it's good to be vigilant, of course, but without more information I wouldn't jump to it.", "> I'm struggling to find a rational explanation for Dad's irrational behavior. \n\nSimple.

Thankfully I was old enough that I didn\u2019t have to do visits with him anymore, but it just got worse from there when I saw him work hard at repairing his relationship with her while practically ignoring me. They got married ~4 years later and told me 6 months after the fact, a fact I tossed in his face when I finally saw him for the first time after 8-10 years. That last time we saw each other, we had a screaming match in public but it felt amazing because I finally stood up for myself and told him how I really felt. He died alone of a drug overdose (aspiration pneumonia), split from his wife, several years later. That was in 2011 and I\u2019ve still not cried over his death because it was just a relief to know the torment and abuse was over.\n\nNever believe someone when they say healing can only come through talking things out with your abusers, Tasty_Resolve. If that\u2019s how you heal, then great! But if you need distance, then trust yourself. People like your father and mine aren\u2019t the kind who listen and take feedback kindly.
