Laughter is what keeps every single good relationship strong. My second marriage is 23 years strong and we have tons of those stories, because that is real life, and our kids love the stories and die laughing. It makes us more real to them.

My (now) husband's first proposal was roughly 3 months after dating, in the ER for a snakebite.

The proposal is literally just your fiance asking you to marry him. Maybe it wasn't hoe either of you planned, but it's kind of rude to request a do-over.\n\n\nAre you more concerned about marrying the guy, or about the story you tell to try to impress people?\n\nIt's not a good look to tell the person you are promising to spend your life with that their efforts weren't good enough. Tell people that it didn't quite go how either of you expected, but that it was a sweet, genuine moment and you're so happy to be together. Get a nice photoshoot done if you want, there's nothing wrong with that. Just don't make him go through the motions again.

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not what you thought you would get lol (and I thought my husband hiding the ring in a Crown Royal bag, plopping it onto the bar and proposing while standing was bad lol) but down the road it is a great story (and it\u2019s kinda sweet that he was so nervous/eager that he just couldn\u2019t wait).", "I think the fact that the story is so interesting makes it great.

If he struggles with anxiety on a daily basis, you don't want to make him think you're already second guessing saying, \"Yes,\" nor do you want to make him feel like an idiot for not waiting. \n\nAlso, when y'all are married 10 years down the road, you'll eventually tell people the real first proposal and will laugh about it. I have a friend who's husband proposed to her by hiding the ring in a slice of cake he made her. She choked on the ring and had to go to the ER. She omitted the choking and ER when she first told everyone she was engaged because he felt soooooo bad.

Boo-fucking-hoo. You got a proposal from the man you love and want to spend the rest of your life with while he was feeling very vulnerable in conjunction with you at arguably your absolutely most vulnerable. You should be dancing on air (while courteously spraying air freshener). Hell, if I were you I would be proud to tell the story of how your beloved proposed. I might even download one of the soundboard apps so you have sound effects to accompany your story. And I would tell that story to the world with love in my heart. Hell, I might even post it on Reddit or some other trash app.\n     We don\u2019t always get our dream scenarios to play out how we\u2019ve imagined for years and years.

Just because they cuddled post-sex doesn\u2019t mean the proposal is about sex. I said finding someone to cuddle with the rest of their lives, not just finding someone to fuck.\n\nI adore my husband and I love cuddling with him. Had he proposed while cuddling after sex, I wouldn\u2019t have felt like I was being treated as a sex toy. Unless he did it as he was pulling out, I guess? \n\nWhat a strange take.", ">at least do it in a situation where I can tell my grandma without killing her\n\n\"We were in bed cuddling and he asked me to marry him.\"\n\nThat's going to kill Granny? No need to say \"post-sex\" (but also, Granny has obviously had her fair share of that too). Just a simple explanation that he proposed while they were cuddling in bed.\n\nI proposed to my husband walking home from a party, on an overpass at 3 AM. No ring, no planning, just asked him to marry me because I had the overwhelming urge to ask. He said yes. Months later, he \"proposed\" back to me with a ring he bought. We were in bed, cuddling. It was really sweet and I didn't feel weird about telling anyone.\n\nIt's kind of a big stretch to assume that, because OP's fiance planned to propose in bed, cuddling after sex, that all they have in common or all they enjoy doing together is having sex...", "I don't like big public displays of affection.  I wanted a private proposal because I don't want to feel pressured to say yes to avoid embarrassing someone. His original plan was probably the perfect proposal in my opinion. And he's usually the one who plans dates and outings, you've entirely misread this.", ">Just because they cuddled post-sex doesn\u2019t mean the proposal is about sex.\n\nLogistically, right after sex is gonna be more complicated than say pulling the ring out while they're cuddling on the couch, watching their favorite movie. He specifically chose the post-sex cuddles instead of cuddles that are more conducive to proposing, so yeah, my bad, he definitely chose those specific cuddles cuz it wasn't about sex. \n\n>What a strange take.\n\nThe strange take is that the only thing the person asking you spend the rest of your life with them has to know is that you like sex. At least with the movie they know your favorite movie, and even that feels like a low bar. It just feels shallow and marriage should be about more than that.", ">I proposed to my husband walking home from a party, on an overpass at 3 AM. No ring, no planning, just asked him to marry me because I had the overwhelming urge to ask.\n\nGreat story. Perfect proposal. I hope this is the one you tell people. \n\n>I had the overwhelming urge to ask.\n\nSpecifically this part. It sounds like you really wanted to spend your life with your partner. \n\n>It's kind of a big stretch to assume that, because OP's fiance planned to propose in bed, cuddling after sex, that all they have in common or all they enjoy doing together is having sex...\n\nIs it? What else do they like to do? Your story says that at least yall like going out, you like spending time together outside of the bedroom. OP's doesn't.", "During my proposal I was calling the emergency line because our downstairs neighbour best up his then girlfriend. It was already postponed by a couple of hours because my now wife had to poop a big poop first, and insisted on going to a pub immediately afterwards.\n\nNot to deny your proposal is a shitty (heh) story haha", "My husband surprised both of us. We were laying in bed talking about the future and it just popped out of his mouth. He didn\u2019t even have a ring yet. After I said yes and we picked out a ring he planned another proposal so we could tell everyone a \u201cbetter story\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be too hard on your fianc\u00e9 just tell the story the way he meant to do it \ud83d\ude0a", ">I don't like big public displays of affection\n\nI didn't say it had to be public, just that he should've done it outta the bedroom. \n\n>His original plan was probably the perfect proposal in my opinion.\n\nWhy? Nothing as romantic as him busting a nut then busting out the ring? Solid foundation for marriage. \n\n>And he's usually the one who plans dates and outings, you've entirely misread this.\n\nSo how did he fuck the proposal up this badly? And why isn't he the one offering to repropose, why are you having to ask him to fix his mistake?", "What I don't understand about your whole point of view is that, you're making this INSANE take, based on one single snapshot of their relationship. \n\nWe get it; you don't want to propose or be proposed to post-coitus. But I don't get why you think everyone else should feel the same way about it. \n\nEven then your take is still a wild leap mentally.", "Again, if he did it while pulling out or something I might get your point. \n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t find it at all insulting to be proposed to sometime after sex while cuddling together. Sex is part of a healthy relationship. \n\nBecause they had sex, he\u2019s ONLY proposing so that he\u2019d keep having sex with her? That\u2019s quite a logical leap.\n\nWe aren\u2019t going to agree on this one.", "Honestly, post sex cuddles are some of the most intimate moments I have with my husband and orher people have with their partners. We talk, we're cuddling, he makes me laugh and feel special and sometimes I'm a goof ball making him laugh. It's pure love and joy - and has nothing to do with the sex we just had. The fact you're zeroed in on that is just weird especially when you're doubling down to the numerous amount of people telling you it's not what you're making it seem. \n\nIf he (my husband) proposed to me during that intimate moment, I would have been pretty damn happy. As it stands, that's not our story and I still love how he proposed. I stand by this statement though; the most important moment of the proposal was him, not the ring, not what we were doing, but him and that he took that leap to ask me to spend the rest of our lives together. \n\nSheesh, can't believe you're harping so hard about this.", "Do you really think if sex was the only thing they had in common they would've been together for 5 years and want get married to each other? Proposing doesn't have to be elaborate or planned or be a cool story to tell everyone else. So I would say yes your assumption is a big stretch.", "So OP said she liked his original plan and then you still want to call it stupid? Stop pushing your agenda for proposals."]}
