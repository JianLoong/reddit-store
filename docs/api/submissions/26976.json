Asking my fiance to redo his proposal cause it wasn't what I imagined for my proposal. \n\n2.

You get your proper proposal, and some nice pics to prove he DEFINITELY didn't propose while you were dropping the kids off at the pool, and he won't feel like he flubbed anything. Congrats btw!", "NTA \n\nBut girl you're already fucked, YOU know the real proposal was on the toilet letting out a log \ud83d\ude06", "Oh man this made me laugh like nothing else. Like a proper belly laugh.\n\nHe could repropose but you both would know that this was the real proposal.\n\nINFO Did you wipe with the ring on your finger? What were the logistics? I can't deal. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA - I get it, but don't do it. What you have is a story that is worth telling... I mean, if your dude wants to marry you SO DAMN MUCH he's willing to get on his knees while you're dropping a deuce?  You tell that story with pride. It's not inappropriate, heck, even kids will laugh!\n\nNow... if he was doing you in the... you know what, nevermind :P\n\nIf he was that mega anxious, I can't imagine what he'd feel like if you basically said it was a failure of a proposal and you want a re-do.  That would probably crush him, unless you know him so well, you are 100% sure he won't take it wrong.", "I mean it is a very funny story and personally I\u2019d just own it, at the end of the day it\u2019s you and him not anyone else, so if someone says something negative then screw them. When I got proposed to, me (26m) and my husband (26m) had just moved into our first house and had gotten into an argument over where we should put the couch and in the middle of the argument he pulled out the ring and said fine put the couch where ever you want, and that was that. I got a proposal and the couch did indeed get placed where I wanted lol. Everyone will always have some shit to say about everything but screw \u2018em.", "You might want a different proposal or wish it had been better but it won't change anything. Just tell the story without the toilet part.", "You could not get me to give up that bring my proposal story for $1m", "Honey, I'm 54 and NBM. I'd take that ring and run even if he'd put it in the toilet!  \ud83d\ude04\n\nI think you two should sit down and come up with the most romantic, over the top, spectacularly full-blown movie worthy proposal story possible.  Then tell folks that one. Wait until their mouth is gaping in glorious wonder at the marvel that was your special moment. Then say just kidding and drop the real deuce filled tale.  They'll never know what hit them...or which is true.", "NAH. If he\u2019s prone to anxiety, I\u2019d tread very carefully about asking for a do-over. I love the suggestion to do a proposal shoot somewhere to provide the \u2018official\u2019 story - tell him you love how it really went down but prefer to keep the story private (you may not be the only one - he may well have some thoughts by now about how it happened \ud83d\ude02).", "This is so hilarious. YWNBTA. Let the real proposal be a secret cherished memory between you two.", "Fun story: my mom got \u201cproposed to\u201d by my Aunt, in my Dads place as a \u201cay why don\u2019t you two get married already so he doesn\u2019t have to sort out a Visa again\u201d comment in a car while driving to a family hang at the beach. She, to this day, tells him HE didn\u2019t propose but HIS SISTER did. It\u2019s a very funny story, at the 20 years he had to buy her a really nice ring.", "my fiance proposed in a way that i cant share with people and is actually illegal. i cant even say it on here cuz im sure ill get hate. when people ask how he proposed i just say it was very romantic and he got down on one knee. i just omit the illegal part and focus on the parts i can share. i dont think a redo will help. it is what it is.", "Kinda?????\nSoo ..i think thats the best story ever to tell kids..\nI got proposed to on a bar napkin..yours is way better\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "I'd just ask him if he is happy for you to tell everyone the romantic true story, and go from there! Congrats on your engagement!", "This post made my morning NAH - just tell everyone whatever you like best", "There's no asshole in this story (apart from the literal poo-excreting one).\n\nI *don't* think you should ask him to re-propose, though.  This proposal story may be embarrassing for you *now*, but 20, 30 years from now, you're going to be so glad you stuck with the truth.\n\nIt's comical, yes, but also endearing, and a testament to his love for you (that he was so excited he couldn't stand to wait).\n\nPlease do *not* approach him with this.  The day will come when you'll be happy you didn't.", "NTA. He's completely thoughtless. His anxiety shouldn't run the show; he should've talked himself down from the ledge and realized proposing on the toilet was inappropriate and that you deserve a proposal with some thought put into it, not just during cuddle time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
