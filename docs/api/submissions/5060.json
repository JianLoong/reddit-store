This depression seemed to worsen whenever I was busier, such as when I took on work promotions with much more responsibility as my older daughter grew older, and then even more so when the twins came along. \n\nMy spouse never sought professional help to address this depression, but instead withdrew and retreated to the \"man cave\" and became a hardcore gamer who did not participate in our family life at all. It has been a really long time since I felt like I had a partner, instead I feel like a single mom with 3 children and one \"bonus\" child. My spouse stopped working around the time the twins were born but refused to care for them, requiring me to hire full time nanny when they were too young for daycare.\n\nI'm extremely close with all my children, but none of them are close with my spouse. They all often say they don't feel close to my spouse and don't even think of my spouse as a parent, more like a distant relative or even roommate.\n\nWithin roughly the past year, my spouse came out as female and wanted to be known as \"Melody.\" My spouse explained that all our problems over the years were due to pretending to be a man when they weren't. Melody was over the moon excited about transitioning, and since I hadn't seen her excited in years, I was happy and hopeful. \n\nThe issue is it's been over a year and Melody is still ONLY excited about transition related things. It hasn't carried over to our family life or being a parent. \n\nMelody insisted on wanting to go with our daughter to pick a prom dress. And Melody also planned to try on prom dresses since she didn't get to do that as a teen. But our daughter didn't want to do that with Melody. That was a special thing she had been looking forward to doing with me ever since she started high school, and she wasn't comfortable with Melody there. Not because she didn't accept Melody as a woman but because she didn't accept her as a parent. That's not how Melody took it though, and she retreated to her den (now called the \"beauty room\") even further.\n\nI have been trying to encourage Melody to be more of a parent to our daughter and asked Melody do the grocery shopping with our daughter instead of me. However, Melody skipped the grocery shop and went to Sephora instead wanting to get makeovers. Again our daughter was uncomfortable.\n\nI confronted Melody about this and she flipped out and started screaming. She said that she hasn't been a woman for very long so I can't put her in a mom role, only a teen role is more appropriate for her. Also due to hormones she's in puberty again so she's a teen, not an adult woman. \n\nI had enough and I told her she's an adult and if she won't do the adult stuff, don't expect to do the fun stuff. She has been locked in her beauty room sobbing and I don't feel I am the asshole, but she says I am.", "created_utc": 1671395275, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp7izg/aita_for_excluding_my_spouse_from_bonding_time/", "score": 426, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It isn't all about her.  She also needs to have compassion that she has ignored her partner and children for years, and is upending all of your lives.

A (I imagine) 40 year old teenager?\n\nYou've enabled your partner enough to the point it is hurting your children.", "YWNBTA on the issue you asked about: you are helping your daughter set boundaries with a parent who has been absent from her life. Your daughter doesn\u2019t want to do these things with Melody and shouldn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s understandable that Melody is excited to explore her developing identity, but I\u2019d also say that Melody needs to be doing this exploring with age-appropriate peers, namely other trans folks who came out later in life. Melody shouldn\u2019t be doing this kind of identity exploration with her own child as if Melody was also a teenage girl. \n\nYou would be the asshole to your children if you don\u2019t figure out a way to get Melody out of the house and responsible for her own well-being. You have gone from being the symbolic parent of Melody to now being their functional and explicit parental figure. It\u2019s unbelievable that your adult spouse would ask you to treat them as if they were your teenage daughter instead. That is an incredibly fucked up dynamic that your children don\u2019t need to be enmeshed in. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t make assumptions about alimony, and I also think that even if it cost you more for a short period of time (say, 3 years to get Melody on her feet), it is worth it to try to establish some kind of healthy boundaries with your co-parent and separate your children from a parent that is not behaving in parental ways towards them.", "NTA\n\nOoooft OP, I was gonna ask about divorce but I saw your comments and you\u2019re in a right bind here. Melody is not a teenager. Yes she is going through a lot but she IS a parent. She needs to start acting like one.", "What the H did I just read. \n\nNTA. Let Melody figure their sh*t out on their own time and in their own house. Your kids are uncomfortable with their own parent, that\u2019s horrible for that parent but it\u2019s their own mistake. \n\nDepression is awful and difficult but the only one responsible for their mental illness is the one with the mental illness. Which means: yes, it\u2019s rough but after such a long time and support from your spouse, (I\u2019m assuming because OP said Melody was never willing) you have to get off your ass and do something about it. Or at least try to. \n\nMelody never did. And now expects everyone to bend to their will. No. No way.", "I really feel for you OP. I recently broke up with my s/o during summer mid-transition because during their transition they failed to keep up with their responsibilities in life as a couple. It was qreaking havoc on me and my mental health. Before that we couldn't be more suited. Its very hard and I cant explain the phenom.\n\nNTA but expect Melody to call you names after you do what you should've done and moved them out of your house", "NTA. I'm afraid she's to self-involved to be a parent. Depression sucks and transitioning is a mental health minefield, so I feel sympathy for her, but I've known people struggle with either and both while still managing to be involved with the people around them.", "So NTA, but I read in the comments that you are worried about alimony, so I just want to tell you to please go visit a lawyer. \n\nYou have proof that you had a nanny, so your partner didn't need to stay at home. \n\nAlso your children do not need child care anymore, so it is unlikely that you would get a support order. \n\nAnd while I want to point out that I am very much in support of the trans community, transitioning is something that would be seen as the court as a major \"irreconcilable differences\" and I can't imagine many judges finding in favor- economically- of your spouse. \n\nAnd by having Melody in your home, you are 100% causing emotional turmoil for your children, given how she acts on a daily basis, NOT because she is transitioning. \n\nI would highly advise you to at least take a few hours and go see a few divorce attorneys. You deserve better, your children deserve better, and if you won't get a divorce at least get yourself and your children therapy.", "nta ... you are not excluding your partner from bonding with your kids .... your kids made a choice .... your kids are not comfortable with this situation yet .... it took your partner years to come to terms with who they are ... they cant expect their kids to accept this huge change over night it will take time ... not because of the transitioning but the absentee parenting", "NTA but you need to talk to a lawyer and make sure your assets are protected for when you're ready to divorce.", "Even if Our spouse wanted to be Petra pan instead of Peter Pan, the pressing issue is the selfishness, the depression, the refusal to grow up and the burdening it all on your shoulders. Stop enabling! Your spouse is neither working nor helping in any form - I doubt you have a partner to share your thoughts and struggles with also. So please, for your kids and your own health stop the enabling. Sure you can set yourself on fire to keep spouse warm, but you have kids aka responsibility. Part of that responsibility is being a good role model (which you currently aren't) and showing them what a healthy relationship looks like (which you don't have). Do you really want your kids stuck with someone who is not working not getting help for their mental health and refusing to grow up? Cause that's what you are setting them up for.

That\u2019s not how life works.  She\u2019s an adult and needs to act like it. If she refuses to hold a job or parent then the benefits that come with being an adult are stripped.  No new clothes.  No new gaming equipment.  If she feels like a teen then she can earn money as one.  All the fast food places are hiring.  The level of irresponsibility and entitlement is breathtaking.

One where one parent gets to check out & not participate with the family while the other pays the bills & does all the work? I don\u2019t care if your spouse was depressed or what gender they are, you both suck as parents for creating this kind of family life for your kids.  Obviously your spouse sucks more than you, ESH.\nEdit: I read your comments where you think you have to pay alimony to Melody & keep her in the same lifestyle as she has now. You should check that assumption with an attorney, the faster the better.

He refused. My friend ended up paying her eldest child & her mother to help out, which her husband complained about.  My friend ended up buying her daughter a car, so that she can drive her younger siblings to school, once again her husband complained that it was a waste of money. My friend did the math and she placed certain amount money in joint account & the rest in her saving. Her husband had access, just not the amount he was accustomed too.

It has been a really long time since I felt like I had a partner, instead I feel like a single mom with 3 children and one \"bonus\" child. My spouse stopped working around the time the twins were born but refused to care for them, requiring me to hire full time nanny when they were too young for daycare.\n\nI'm extremely close with all my children, but none of them are close with my spouse. They all often say they don't feel close to my spouse and don't even think of my spouse as a parent, more like a distant relative or even roommate.\n\nWithin roughly the past year, my spouse came out as female and wanted to be known as \"Melody.\" My spouse explained that all our problems over the years were due to pretending to be a man when they weren't. Melody was over the moon excited about transitioning, and since I hadn't seen her excited in years, I was happy and hopeful. \n\nThe issue is it's been over a year and Melody is still ONLY excited about transition related things.
