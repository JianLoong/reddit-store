Get her banking authority revoked and don\u2019t offer to pay for anything anymore. Time for her to grow the f up.", "NTA. You paid for her vacation when it sounds like all you offered to pay was flights. Her further taking money from your account (why does she have access to your account? Change that immediately) is theft, plain and simple. And if this is how she responds to a FREE vacation, I'd stop bringing her along, and stop paying for her.", "NTA. \n\n28 and demanding you pay for her Uber is crazy. And entitled. Having her as a listed user on your account probably needs to stop too. \n\nBut a surging Uber ride in the Bay to home is trash and she should've taken cal train or checked her ticket ealier and asked a friend to pick her up. IT IS CALLED PREPATION AND PROACTIVE PLANNING. \n\n** SIDE NOTE:  I immediately thought ,\" what a south bay princess\" when I read this.", "Your daughters the asshole. First of all as a 28 year old young woman who has an income she got a completely free holiday and she complains about an uber rides and then proceeds to steal that money from you. What is this nonsense. Next time leave your daughter behind and take me. I'll pay for my own ubers without stealing from you and also won't have the audacity to then screw at you", "NTA how did she not know which airport she was flying into", "How can your daughter take money out of your account unless she's an authorized and included on the account?", "NTA- 28 is old enough to read her own airline tickets and plan ahead.   She could have asked a friend to pick her up if she didn\u2019t want to pay.  This is a crazy level of entitlement and not very appreciative.

You got her to Maui and back, (ok, she payed her Uber to SFO,) and then wants to complain about the Uber home from the airport?

Doesn\u2019t want to go to Maui but does because you literally pay for everything? Then whines about an Uber on the way back? Oof. I would say NTA though because all the money she saved on a free trip to paradise, she can sacrifice an Uber.", "NTA \u2026 but holy guacamole Batman, your daughters 28 years old and acting like a 14 year old.

She is old enough to have her own account and not have access to yours. She is entitled and you made her that way. Now it\u2019s your job to allow her to be an adult and not enable her.  Tell her since you are going into my account without permission you will not have access to it. And follow through with it. A lot of time people say things and never back up they words which makes they words powerless and just words. Hold true to your word.", "YTA YOU created this monster. To recap, your daughters didn\u2019t want to spend time in Maui because of reasons, but the older one went because of \u201chey it\u2019s free\u201d. The younger one said no thanks. Maybe that\u2019s ok, but if the older one agreed to go, behaving like a brat is unacceptable.\n\nAfter receiving thousands of dollars in travel, food and lodging, she is miffed because of the Uber fees. For her, she doesn\u2019t realize the importance of family, loyalty, or financial benefits. Where did she learn this? At 28 why is her ungrateful self entitled self deserving of a safety net emergency card?\n\nWhat are you irritated with her for acting as she has been taught? \n\nThat your money solves problems, forces everyone into family events, and gratitude isn\u2019t part of her vocabulary.", "ESH. Your daughter is extremely entitled, ungrateful, and spoiled. Y T A for raising her to think this behavior is even remotely acceptable. And at 28 years old? She's acting like a 5 year old. I'm glad you're doing something about it now but sheesh you're a little late on it.", "NTA, taking your money without permission = theft.
