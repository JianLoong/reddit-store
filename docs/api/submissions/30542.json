Since Thornbirds is about a lady having an affair with a priest from what I recall and WWII didn't seem to be a cheerful option, I threw in Neverending story.\n\n I then tried to figure food out, which left the options of Poptarts or a sketchy can of corn stuffed in the back of the cupboard. We had planned to go out to the little store down the road but it closes at 8 this time of year. Anything else is about a 45 minute drive. So poptarts for dinner it is. \n\nUnfortunately, I forgot about the swamp scene in Neverending Story and my nieces were quite upset.

Being generous, because I don't know her, your sister is stressed and she's lashed out. She doesn't have the control she wants, so she's reaching out with a death-grip and frustration. It doesn't excuse it, just might be factors.", "NTA about the food. And as for the movie, you're just inexperienced with kids I guess, so it's not your fault. You never let kids watch something you haven't watched, I mean kids so young, and when in doubt, you watch it with them. It's very hard to keep kids away from inappropriate content and it does irreparable damage.", "Did you have car seats for the kids? If not how the f you suppose to haul them 45 minutes to store?!  You. NTA,  sister and bil yta..  her for being pi$$y bil...  well if he hadn't broken his leg, you would not have been trapped into babysitting.", "NTA- that movie did traumatize me as a kid, but that\u2019s more of an issue with 80s live action movies aimed at kids than the movie being a \u201chorror movie\u201d. Plus the kids were probably already scared and upset because their dad fell and broke his leg.", "NTA but I was also traumatized by a Neverending Story so I kinda get it. You did what you could in a bad situation though and she shouldn't blame you for that!", "NtA.\n\nThe Neverending story was one of my favorite movies as a kid. Sure there are dark parts and Artax still haunts me. This classic lets children experience loss and triumph and really the full spread of the human condition..it infuses fantasy, wonder, and this ultimate sense of adventure. The costumes are super cool. \n\nPoptarts aren\u2019t ideal but it was one meal.", "NTA, of course. Did she even leave you their car seats?", "NTA My god, the pearl clutching. She\u2018s acting like you put on Human Centipede and gave them bleach for dinner. I\u2018m sure the girls had a great time and will soon recover from the severe trauma of eating pop tarts and watching a movie lmao", "Well sister, wouldn't have been a problem if you took YOUR children with YOU.  You did what you could with what you had. If she keeps pushing, you could mention that .\n\nNTA", "Info:: did you have car seats for the kids?", "NTA - if you'd remembered about the horse swamp death and at that point just not cared to check with your sister it might be different, but it's easy to forget individual details from films over time and here (UK) it's rated U for universal which is what all kids' films get.", "Neverending story is a kids movie. The food part, should've driven, for your own sake too. \nThat amount of sugar... Not a great idea for kids that age, plus not really filling enough to call it a meal.\n\nEither way, NTA. Your sister is being extremely ungrateful. This was an emergency, you're not a professional nanny and food your best.", "NTA. You did well.\n\nKids get upset by things. It's part of growing up.\n\nMy kid talked for months about that Frozen scene where the parent's ship kind of tips over and disappears. She wouldn't sleep in her own bed for a long time and was upset when her dad and I went to work at the same time, and wanted us to PROMISE not to go on any boats. Every day. We don't live near the ocean. And this was a modern, soft Disney movie... You never know what will affect them and not.", "NTA.  I think your sister should be appreciative of the fact that you cared for her children in an emergency situation.", "Lmao my mom had to leave the theater with me as kid but it was cuz I freaked over the wolf scene. The horse scene was a rite of passage for many a Xennial in the 80\u2019s. Bambi, ET, The Lion King all made me cry and there are tons of similar scenes in other movies. NTA. Thanks for digging up that memory tho lol.", "To be fair, there\u2019s an entire generation of adults living and functioning in society having trauma bonded over that scene. \ud83d\ude12 If you didn\u2019t have car seats for the kids, you shouldn\u2019t have been driving with them. IDK. Not a good situation all around but you could have done worse.", "YTA, should have at least taken them out for food. As for the Never Ending Story, NTA, you forgot about the scene and didn\u2019t do it on purpose. But I understand your sisters frustration because the kids sleep might end up being screwed up for months over that which will make life a nightmare for that whole family.", "NTA You did the best with what was available.  Driving them to get food, did you even have car seats/booster seats for them?  And a 2hr trip to get them food.   Pop tart fine it was an emergency.  Neverending story is a kids movie.", "NTA.  Any variety of kids movie can \u201cscare\u201d a kid.  I still feel so traumatized by Dumbo I refuse to watch it and never finished it.  You know how hard it was to watch that poor baby elephant be ripped away from his mama and then be treated cruelly?  That is a classic Disney movie meant for children.  What movies does your sister usually show your nieces?  Even Veggies Tales can be traumatizing in the right environment.\n\nAnd what were you supposed to do? Conjure up a nutritious meal with magic?  Eating pop tarts for one meal isn\u2019t going to harm the children (barring some medical issue).  Does she not feed them pop tarts for breakfast?  Lol. Like come on.  If she was THAT concerned about them eating specific nutritional foods she would have packed them snacks.\n\nAlso, I seriously doubt her anger is really about you letting them see a kids movie and eating pop tarts.  Her emotional reaction was probably more about her fear of losing her husband and realizing how quickly shit can go wrong\u2026and she is left to parent two little kids alone.  \n\nOr maybe your sister is just an asshole who can\u2019t appreciate that she had someone to leave her kids with who loves them and is willing to watch them for free at a moments notice.\n\nEither way, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA.", "That's a great point! \nTwo little kids in a cabin all night without either of their parents. Plus the stress of their aunt and the memories of Dad falling off the roof and everyone's panicked reactions was definitely more likely the cause of the nightmares. \nOp, NTA, your sister has two kids who need screws and she accidentally took theirs. Sure the other movies would have been worse, but if these kids are the kind that can play actual games then I bet some would be at the cabin or they would have brought some. You did a great job, I'm sure your sister has not thought how hard the situation was on you. You kept their lives running while they stepped out and dealt with the emergency. \ud83e\udd0d", "My sister had nightmares from Totoro when she was little, kids really do get nightmares from everything. \n\nHell, I babysit and will do my first bedtime with a new family today. Mom told me she expects them to be alive, fed (with food she provides) and for one of them to have taken his medication. Ideally in bed before she's home (around midnight), anything else is bonus. One of them has to follow a special (and really strict) diet so he couldn't just have anything, but other than any food in the house is free game if parents aren't there. \nThat's less strict than OPs emergency childcare and I get paid for this stuff! I used to work as an aide and we all acknowledged that the first week with a new kid/aide would probably be a mess too. If you don't know a child well and don't know you'll be watching them you won't know what they do and don't get nightmares from and might not have decent food at home. They'll survive one night, and it's better than being home alone.\n\nPlus, if OP wanted to drive for food they'd either need to leave the kids home alone or have carseats for the children, which they probably don't.", "It's certainly on the more mature end of kids movies. I'm *mumblemumble* years old now and still get upset thinking about losing Artax. And the scene towards the end where he's fighting the dark beast in the ruins could be scary for little kids. But in the end it's really only borderline for the 4 year old.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso one night of pop tarts for dinner wont kill them.", "You can\u2019t take kids that age anywhere without car seats.", "I agree that OP has no other choice and that Neverending Story is the most appropriate of the options.\n\nThat said. I was the youngest niece's age when that movie came out and my mom took me to see it in the theater. One of my earliest memories is crawling into her lap in the theater, sobbing because that movie scared me *so much*. In fact, it scared me so much at that age that to this day - literally 39 years later - my first reaction when I'm reminded of the movie is fear. Even though I've seen it since and know it's not scary,", "Guess someone never watched the Neverending story at 6 years old. And that's without the added distress of dad being injured and the kids not know how he'll be. Texas Chainsaw Massacre might have been less upsetting.\n\nOP still isn't the asshole but I would have gone with Thornbirds.", "There are best practice safety recommendations and then there are what\u2019s legally required (varies state to state and by country). The best practices are recommended by car seat safety personnel and based on data from crashes, etc. in the majority of US states a 4 and 6 year old need to have a child seat. By best practices the 4 year old should still be in a five point harness. My kids hate me because they had a booster seat until 5th grade and aren\u2019t allowed up front until 13. Thankfully we were never in a bad crash, but I read one horror story about one where a 7 year old didn\u2019t have a booster and that was enough for me.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the sister had the seats in her car (along with the tablet) when she had to go with the BIL to hospital. OP did the best she could with what she had, hopefully the sister will realize that when she gets past the initial trauma.\n\nOh, and my parents let me watch Jaws when I was six. Talk about nightmares!!!!", "My mom went out for a girls night when I was 3. My dad and I went to the video store to get movies and snacks. I could read enough to see \"duck\" on a VHS box and asked my dad for that one. We both learned pretty quick that Howard the Duck isn't a kids movie.", "Now all I can think of is a horror movie called Neverending Centipede.", "Yeah, why did OP's sister even bring the kids? What was the actual plan of what to do with them?", "I saw it as a 5 year old in the cinema when it was still relatively recent and it was the wolf that freaked me out. In a good way, but it's my first memory of a scary movie scene.\n\nThough I did re-watch it in my early 30s and had a sudden heartstopper \"oh no!\" moment when they entered the swamp as I'd completely forgotten about poor Artax.", "As it should be.", "The glowing eyes!\n\nI had the most realistic nightmare as a kid about that wolf stalking me around the graveyard of the church next to my primary school. Never mind that that church doesn't even have a graveyard, I've never had a dream feel so realistic and even though it was bone-chillingly terrifying I'd love to get that hit again.", "Tbf OP had seen the film, just forgotten about one scene and it's also rated as suitable for kids.\n\nPlus, watching it at about that age is effectively a rite of passage and one thing that unites people across multiple generations by now.", ">True that kids can get nightmares about anything, literally a few scenes in \"The Brave Little Toaster\" gave me nightmares as a kid lol.\n\nI had a nightmare about toothbrushes. Kids are weird, and these kids will be fine.", "I\u2019m 28 and still not over Artax though \ud83d\ude2d", "I've been watching scary movies as long as I can remember. The first one that really freaked me out was \"Something Wicked This Way Comes,\" literally produced by Disney. It led to a love of horror, and also helped me learn that if I rewatch a scary movie over and over again it loses power over me. I lost track of how many times I watched \"It\" when I was 12. lol It's now s happy, comforting movie to me. hahaha Neverending Story is completely appropriate for kids, and the kids didn't starve. It was literally an emergency. NTA", "Yeah the wolf scene is super scary.  I always had to leave the room.  Artax was straight up traumatizing S a young child lol", "That choice was Yahtzee. So if she'd thought of googling what you can do with dice at that age she may have had an option but honestly I don't blame her for trying to put on something that's a known kid movie. I personally hated it for the same reason those girls do but I remember kids in my class having themed birthdays based on it.", "This is a key point actually! Was OP even able to take the kids for food in their car?", "Not the bunnies :(", "I agree that OP is NTA, but that swamp scene in Neverending Story still gets to me. I'm 43. However, just because the scene is scary doesn't mean the kids can't see it. Like others have said, it is a kid' movie. It's also a really good movie. \n\nAs far as food goes, going to camp means not eating the healthiest food. I have a big snack box at my camp, and all the kids who show up there know they have unfettered access to that box. None of them have turned into degens yet. It's one dinner of Pop Tarts.", "Atreyuuuuuuuuuuu", "I was like that with Labyrinth. Now I've worn out four dvd's and counting lol", "I mean, kids movies introducing the concept of death in ways that stick with them for years is a time-honored tradition.\n\nThey\u2019re going to encounter death one way or another, and reality isn\u2019t going to be nearly as gentle about it as a movie will be.
