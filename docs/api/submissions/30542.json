My sister also came up, with her husband and two kids, who are 4 and 6 year old girls.\n\n So my BIL fell of the roof and my sister had to take him to the ER about an hour away , his leg is broken ( he will be fine). So now I have the kids and sister left with the kids tablet in the back of the car. So since the kids are upset, and want to watch something, I dig out the old VCR and attach it to the TV. We only had 3 movie options, an old Miniseries called the Thornbirds, a WWII documentary, and Neverending story. Since Thornbirds is about a lady having an affair with a priest from what I recall and WWII didn't seem to be a cheerful option, I threw in Neverending story.\n\n I then tried to figure food out, which left the options of Poptarts or a sketchy can of corn stuffed in the back of the cupboard. We had planned to go out to the little store down the road but it closes at 8 this time of year. Anything else is about a 45 minute drive. So poptarts for dinner it is. \n\nUnfortunately, I forgot about the swamp scene in Neverending Story and my nieces were quite upset. They calmed down and watched the rest but now are having nightmares. My sister says I should have drove to get them proper food and played a game with them, not a scary movie. I said that the only game was Yatzi and they are way to young for that, and I did my best. She's mad as hell at me. My mom said maybe I should have drove to get food but my dad agreed that was to long a drive at night with little kids.

Your sister is being all kinds of ridiculous here.", "I watched The Neverending Story when I was 5 for the first time. The kids will be fine. Poptarts for one meal will not kill them. NTA", "NTA. You did great with what you had. They should be grateful you were there to watch them. \n\nDid you even have booster seats to safely drive the kids in your car? I'm not a parent, but I feel like kids need booster seats forevers now.", "NTA\n\nEmergency childcare is for emergencies.  Were the kids alive and not significantly injured when they got back?  Great, you did a good job.\n\nNightmares are unpredictable and kids that age can have them about anything.\n\nLike, say, their dad falling off a roof, being in pain and disappearing for a long time with their mom.

You did your best, and you're definitely NTA - The Neverending Story is a GREAT film.

Remind your sister that you helped her out by watching her kids in an emergency, and she has a problem with that then she never needs to ask you to help her out in an emergency again. Pop-Tarts for dinner is not a big deal for one night. And if she has a problem with it again maybe she should have stayed home with her children and let someone else go with her husband to get his like taken care of. That's exactly what I would be saying to her", "Nta. Neverending story is a canon event. Pop tarts are fine for an emergency", "Nta, I put on All Dogs to to Heaven for my five year old. He's 17 now and perfectly delightful. They'll be ok.", "NTA- I\u2019m assuming based on having the tablet that sis took her car to the hospital. So did you have child seats? If not then that is the only argument you need to shut her up. It would not have been safe to take the girls to the store. \n\nIf you happened to have the seats, you still aren\u2019t the AH. You helped out in an emergency and did your best. Pop tarts for dinner every now and then won\u2019t kill anyone. Nor will a scary movie. And I say this as some one who was allowed to watch some proper horror movies at WAY to young an age", "You did the best job you could, OP, and you are definitely NTA. I imagine that the kiddos probably heard or saw some chaos when their dad fell off the roof. You could\u2019ve had them watch Sesame Street. They were probably going to have nightmares anyway.\n\nYour sister is stressed. The hospital isn\u2019t cheap and her husband fell off a roof. She shouldn\u2019t turn it on you, but she did. She\u2019s your sister, and you know her best. Can you give her some grace or is she always unreasonable? Did she really want you to drive her kids that far past their bedtime? Did she even leave the booster seats?", "NTA\n\nYou did fine OP.\n\nBut I would certainly use this experience as a valid reason to never watch your sister's kid again.  She's hardcore ungrateful.", "NTA- we all watched scary movies as kids. Its a right of passage lol I\u2019m sure they will be fine.

I\u2019m going to assume you don\u2019t have booster/car seats if the mom left the tablet in her car.

Did you even have proper car seats for the kids if your sister took her vehicle?", "ATREYU!!!!", "NTA your sister didn\u2019t give any sort of entertainment besides the tablets. She didn\u2019t bring any food for the kids either.  She came ill prepared with kids.  That is not your fault.  I could understand if the kids had allergies that made the pop tarts dangerous for them.  However providing supplies for kids is the job of parent.", "NTA You did what you could in an unprepared cabin. Jeez your sister is pretty ungrateful. Chalk up her unreasonableness to anxiety due to Er visit and move on.", "NTA. It's not ideal but the situation was never going to be. And their father fell of a roof and had to rushed to the er, it's entirely possible they'd be having nightmares with or without The Neverending Story because that's a scary situation.", "NTA. She needs to chill out. She could\u2019ve taken them to the ER with her if you weren\u2019t a good enough option for her. What do people expect when someone who isn\u2019t used to kids helps out? They\u2019re alive, assume warm and safe. It\u2019s one night. Wow.", "NTA. I know I wouldn\u2019t have left the cabin.
