A teacher sharing their personal problems with the class is inappropriate, but they are the authority in that room, not you, and it isn't your place to correct them on the appropriateness of that in response to them giving you valid classroom instructions.  You should have stopped talking when told to stop talking over him and then gone through proper channels after class.  \n\n\nHowever I'm going to go with NTA because I cannot imagine any scenario in which using a student in the classroom as an example like that would ever be acceptable, even if it wasn't ALSO clearly bullying.
