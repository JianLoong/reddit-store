He then told me to stop talking over him, and then said I was lying. \n\nNot The Asshole", "Hi op, I'm autistic and work in the disability rights field. A lot of what I do is education advocacy. I've also worked in the school system before. First off, you're clearly NTA. Also, I am very happy to see you stand up for yourself. Here is some advice on handling this.\n\nYou should also not bring this to the school board directly. School boards can't discuss personnel at a board meeting. If they were to get involved at all, they would need to discuss it privately during an \"executive session.\" Boards do not usually have purview over personnel matters anyway, unless it is the superintendent or sometimes a principal. Basically, going directly to the school board is useless at best and harmful at worst. \n\nInstead, you should try any of these people: \n\n1) Your school's principal. I assume you already went to them by now. The principal has the authority to reprimand and/or fire your teacher for bullying, harassment, and inappropriate conduct in the classroom. I would make it clear to your principal that this is unacceptable behavior and that you are not able to find a resolution other than your teacher being removed from the classroom. Ideally, bring your other classmates to vouch for you and your story. \n2) ADA/504 Coordinator. If you are in the U.S., which it seems you are, your school district must have at least one person fulfilling this role by law. Usually they are the special education director, but sometimes they are actually someone who makes sure the district is in compliance with the civil rights portions of those laws. If you're experiencing gender based discrimination as well, then I'd similarly suggest your district's Title IX officer.\n3) Your state's superintendent office (sometimes this is a state department of education). Sometimes these offices investigate problems like these and try to create resolutions. If you're in Washington State specifically, I'd also say call the Office of the Education Ombuds. \n4) Your state and/or territory's Protection and Advocacy system. NDRN.org will have it. I'd give them a call if they're openly retaliating against you, such as withholding graduation, attempting to send you to an out of district/state placement during an IEP process due to \"behavior issues\", etc. \n5) Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education. If you have a statewide office, that is good. This suggestion is for the federal DoE. You're experiencing disability discrimination and harassment, which is an ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act issue. This is not normally what people file 504 complaints for, but, again, if there's retaliation happening now or in the future it is a legitimate place to ask for help. \n6) Media. Honestly, school systems don't function to handle internal matters like these. Media attention can make obvious firing decisions, like these, a little more urgent for an administrator. I would go to the media about this if reporting within the school district does not work. Going to the media also increases the chance you will face retaliation. However, school districts don't always do blatantly terrible things like that. It is just a possibility, and one I have seen happen to other people in similar situations. \n\nIf your mom does want to pursue talking to the board, she should talk individually with a board member she knows best rather than approaching them at a board meeting. She should also frame it as an issue with the school not handling complaints well rather than an issue with that particular teacher. The board can then look into the matter if they feel it is their job to do so, which they probably won't. \n\nIn any case, I hope you get this resolved soon. This is screwed up and I wish you the best.", "Please update us, im livid for you right now", "NTA pupils wahouldnt know much about their teachers' personal life he needs therapy, and as for using you as an example, there are enough examples in public media without having to single you out.

Second, you leave out an important part of what you did to start the stupid conversation.  We doubt he started calling you asperic and disruptive if you were sitting silently in class listening.

Or do you think that somehow the political attitudes of the Viennese psychiatrist who described the behavioral syndrome somehow makes invoking his name an insult?
