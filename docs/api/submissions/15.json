{"id": 15, "submission_id": "yijihd", "title": "AITA for telling my friend to \"get over\" herself and leaving her wedding reception \"early\"?", "selftext": "I was recently a Bridesmaid for my best friend, her only Bridesmaid i'll add so a lot of the bridal duties fell to me. We'd been best friends since I was 15 and she was 17 though so I was fine with all this work. Quick info I have health issues which lead to extreme fatigue as a symptom. The day before the wedding I basically singlehandedly set up her reception while she talked with some family and friends, which was fine, as I was wrapping up she told me she needed my help sewing a button on her wedding dress as her Aunt hadn't fully finished the alterations. I told her of course i'd do this and she said she'd call up her aunt to walk me through what needed done. I had a bad feeling about this as it's only one button, that hardly needs a walkthrough but I put it down to my friend being overly worried as it's her wedding dress. It wasn't one button. I get to her home and we get on the phone with her aunt. It's six buttons, the clasps to attach her cloak (which needed hemmed) and the corset lacing needed adjusting. I was pissed but not at my friend I figured she didn't know how bad it was it had been her aunts job to alter the dress. A little quick info she bought a cheap dress figuring aunt could alter it.\n\nI fixed the dress having to stay up until 3am to do so, then I had to be up at 6am to be ready for the wedding. After we are ready for the wedding my friend told me she'd forgotten to ask me to do this yesterday and asks me if i'll sew marvel patches onto her garter belt for her as a surprise for her fiance. I agreed albeit a bit unhappily as my hands were in agony from sewing into the early morning. So we get through the wedding, my friend promises me that I can go back to nap before the reception this evening as there is a few hours between the lunch and reception. That's basically all that was keeping me going. But then plans change and she needs me to stay with her and not go back to nap. I stay as I don't want to leave her alone and drink way too much coffee to try and stay semi-human even though my body aches and i'm exhausted. Despite this i'm struggling to stay awake at the reception and manage until the food is served and eaten and the first dance happens, i figure i've seen all the important parts and go to my friend telling her I need to go home now to sleep as I literally cannot stay upright anymore. She got upset at me saying how I wasn't allowed to leave and she needed me by her side, how I was her only bridesmaid so I had to stay until the very end in case she needed me and how I needed to greet guests who turned up late. I got upset at this and told her to get over herself pointing out all i'd done for her so. far  and that I loved her but that had limits with my health. So I left and slept for about 14 hours waking up the next day with a migraine and various aches.\n\nShe is upset thinking I \"ruined\" her day and that i'm selfish for not putting her first, that I was needed by her side and how a real friend would prioritise her day\n\nEdit: Typo", "created_utc": 1667239275, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yijihd/aita_for_telling_my_friend_to_get_over_herself/", "score": 2086, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was older, cooler, \"prettier\", a talented actress and singer. I naturally looked up to her, and at the same time I was told I was mature for my age, her parents felt I was a good influence in her life. When she confided in me and relied on me for emotional support, it made me feel important and needed. \n\nIt took years after my family moved to another state for me to eventually come to accept that all that time I called it friendship, it was really me being taken advantage of. Because I was always told how I was more mature for my age when I was around her(people frequently mistook me for being older than her) I didn't listen when my mom tried to gently point out she worried that my friend took advantage of me. How could I be taken advantage of when my age apparently didn't matter? Because I was told how I was a good influence on her, I felt responsible to maintain that position of a good influence in her life even as our conversations stopped being conversations and were just about her problems and how miserable she was - she would never ask me about what I was going through, and if I tried to talk about it she would always change the subject. \n\nTo this day it's not only incredibly hard for me to talk to other people about my own problems, it's difficult for me to even acknowledge I have problems. Even when I have serious, difficult issues, I downplay them to myself and others because \"someone somewhere has it worse\". \n\nI worry that OP's relationship with this friend has a similar dynamic to what I went through with my older \"friend\". To OP, I offer this advice: Pay attention when she calls you or spends time with you: does she ever ask you about yourself? Does she ever show concern for your struggles, or remember to check in on you? Was this wedding event the first time you pushed your own health past a safe point for the sake of Bride? And if not, does she ever check in with you at all about your health, or show concern if you try to discuss it with her? \n\nDon't downplay your problems just because \"someone somewhere has it worse\", and if Bride has ever pushed you like this before for any other reason? I strongly suggest you distance yourself, gently, from this friend. This wedding is an example of her pushing you, testing limits, and if she's anything like the person I decided to leave in the past, she'll never stop pushing your limits for her own inconsiderate impulses and needs.", "NTA she used and abused you.
