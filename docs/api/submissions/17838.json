Now I\u00b4m in college and I have an amazing boyfriend (21m) of 7 months. My boyfriend has a group of friends since they were kids and I officially met them this friday. He talked to me about them, including the girlfriend of his best friend, whose name is Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 (20f). Just from the name, I knew she was also latina, so I asked.\r\n\nMy boyfriend told me that she was born in Argentina, and I got very excited to meet her. I never had a best friend since I moved to the US because of the cultural difference and this was my chance to bond with someone from the same background as me. I even read some current news about her country to make small talk. There's also a very common nickname given to her name back in LATAM, so I thought that calling her by that nickname would make me sound friendlier and serve as an icebreaker.\n\nThe night of the meeting, she arrived and I excitedly greeted her in full Spanish. She looked confused and asked me \"What did you say?\". I repeated it in English and called her by the nickname, but she cut me off with \"please call me Jojo\". It was a bad start, but I didn't give up yet. We made small talk and I tried to ask her about her culture, the typical food, the news I read, etc., but she didn't know anything and it pissed me off a bit. I asked Jojo if she was really born in Argentina and she said yes, but that she identified herself more as a \"Paper Latina\". I asked about it and she explained. Jojo was indeed born in Argentina, but they moved when she was just a few months old to the US. Since her parents didn't intend to ever return, the decided to raise her \"full American\" (hence why she doesn't speak Spanish).\r\n\nThe \"Paper Latina\" thing is because in legal documents, she appears as born in Argentina, and that allowed her to obtain a lot of cultural diversity scolarships over the years, including one right now that along some other ones, got her a full free ride on college. However, she doesn't care about her birth country, and even laughed saying that this was the only good thing about not being born in the US, and the rest of the group also laughed (including my boyfriend) for how she \"hacked the system\".\r\n\nI got very offended and angry. I told her that people like her are the reason there's so much racism and discrimination against minorities and that she should at least be ashamed of not knowing about her own culture. Jojo felt silent and pointed out that the US is her culture because she grew up here. Everything got awkward, I said some other things I'm not proud of and we left early.\r\n\nMy boyfriend has received texts from the group saying that I'm no longer invited to their meetings because I went into full \"crazy latina\" mode and they don't need my petty drama. My boyfriend is on my side, but is very upset that his friends don't like me.

People like her are the least likely to be the cause or target of racism.", "YTA You made all kinds of assumptions about this person and even planned ahead based on those assumptions, then got pissed off when this stranger to you didn't meet them.  Then you got intensely political during your first meeting with someone who is close to your boyfriend, creating tension for everyone.", "YTA. YOU made every assumption about her before ever seeing her and then shamed her because she didn\u2019t meet your expectations.\n\nThe reason there is so much racism and discrimination is that people are racist and make judgements and assumptions about people they don\u2019t know. \n\nIn this situation, you are the racist.

She is not responsible for racism and discrimination against minorities and she is not to be shamed for decisions her parents made upon migrating to the US.

I also think whoever brought up the \"crazy Latina\" stereotype was TA.", "YTA\n\nYou were TA before you even met her. You took one piece of information and decided who she is, what topics would be discussed,  what her priorities & interests were and jumped WAY ahead in the process of getting acquainted with her.\n\n\n>There's also a very common nickname given to her name back in LATAM, so I thought that calling her by that nickname would make me sound friendlier and serve as an icebreaker\n\nThis alone was presumptuous and obnoxious. Just because it is a common nickname doesn't mean she uses or likes it. Some people are very happy with nicknames,  others prefer that everyone outside their family & closest friends call them by their actual name .\n\n\nYou have no idea why her parents left Argentina- there may be very real reasons they turned their backs on their homeland altogether and decided not to foster in their daughter a sense of connection to her birthplace.  You have no right whatsoever to judge her for having been raised,  from babyhood, as just an American and no right to judge her for taking advantage of the programs and scholarships available to immigrants and the children of immigrants.  Her family ARE immigrants.  That they decided on fully assimilating doesn't change that. That was their right.\n\nThen you tried to say that she is the cause of racism & prejudice against Latin Americans while displaying a great deal of prejudice AND living up to a couple of the less pleasant perceptions of Latinas is both AH behavior and ironic as hell.\n\nFinally,  you disrupted someone else's gathering and embarrassed the fuck out of your boyfriend by making an ugly scene.", "YTA\n\nYou are a complete and total embarrassment to your BF and yourself.  Her culture is American. Since you immediately jumped to she\u2019s the \u201creason racism exists\u201d, I can only imagine your other comments that you chose to omit had to be waaaay worse.  Are you always like this, judging and shaming people for how YOU perceive they should behave?  Why BF hasn\u2019t kicked you to the curb YET is a mystery.", "YTA.  She's not \"hacking the system\".  No matter how she was raised, she is very likely going to be discriminated against due to her appearance and people's assumptions about her background.  That's the main purpose of those scholarships, to try to level the playing field.  You also put a lot of expectations on and made a lot of assumptions about someone you hadn't even met yet.", "YTA\n\nYour reaction was a massive overreaction! \n\nTo say people like her are the reason for racism and discrimination and that she should be ashamed of herself is all utter AH behaviour.\n\nYou made someone you'd just met deliberately uncomfortable and then don't understand why you're the AH in this situation? Unbelievable.\n\nBased on your version of events I wouldn't want to hang out with you either.", "YTA. I got so much second hand embarrassment reading this. You made assumptions about her and when she told you she grew up in the USA and THAT is her culture, you got upset she didn\u2019t live up to your weird standards", "YTA. This is actually my first time hearing that term before and I think it's pretty messed up. To actually get offended that someone of central or south American descent because they don't speak the language or embrace the culture is ridiculous.\nWhat next, are you going to call her an anchor baby or race traitor? Tell her that she's only allowed to speak Spanish and eat food from Argentina? Just because someone is or was from some place doesn't mean they have to be a stereotype of it, people are allowed to be develop their own unique identity.", "YTA. You made up expectations for someone in your own head and then you got mad at her for not meeting them. Jojo was raised American. By her parents choice. That is her culture. She\u2019s not required to feel an attachment to the country she was born in. How do you figure that \u201cpeople like her are why there is so much racism and discrimination\u201d when you literally profiled her to fit your expectations based on heritage?", "YTA - you don't have the authority to choose how latina, how ethnic, how \"real\" anyone is. Those programs you mention were put in place to help families like hers. You don't get to be the gatekeeper. I'd say YOUR attitude is why we have so much racism in this country. You are saying she has to act a certain way since she is from a certain culture. That is 100% racist. Don't bring that shit to this country. We got enough already. \n\n\nAlso, you owe everyone involved a big old apology.", "YTA\n\nThis is your BF's friend group. The first time you meet them you are barely there and you verbally attacked/harassed an accepted member of the group.. No matter what anyone thinks of the this girl you have established your self as crazy and overly sensitive.  They will actively try to sabotage your relationship that is not even a year old. Because of your behavior none of him friends will welcome you to future gatherings. They wont want their friend the \"paper latina\" to feel uncomfortable.  They will never trust that future at some point one of them wont also be subjected to a similar tantrum if they offend you with an off hand remark. This puts your BF in the position to decide if dating you is worth having to get a whole new friend group or to attend all events stag because you are not welcome.", "YTA - You made assumptions and got mad when Jojo didn\u2019t meet your expectations. That\u2019s on you. Her being Latina on paper only doesn\u2019t make her exempt from racism or generalizations\u2026which you demonstrated, since you pigeon-holed her as soon as you learned she was Argentinian.\n\nOne of my parents and uncles are half-Latino with an immigrant father, but they were never taught the language and raised mostly \u201cAmerican.\u201d That didn\u2019t stop them from being ostracized by the rest of the family for being \u201cthe Latino kids.\u201d\n\nBeing proud of your cultural identity is nice and important. But you are not entitled to how someone else relates to their culture, and you have no right to get offended over someone\u2019s lack of interest in their background. Trying to place the world\u2019s racial and societal problems on her shoulders is absurd.", "YTA - Don't be mad at her for not caring about her place of birth, she has no memories from that place and her birth is the only connection she has to it. She was raised like any other American, if she doesn't show any interest about her place of birth that's her decision not yours", "YTA and racist lol. Just cause someone is from a place doesn't mean they're predisposed to acting a certain way. Pretty simple, even if your intention was positive racism, you still acted racist by assuming anything about her and typecasting her based on her heritage.", "YTA without doubt.  You don't get to dictate what level of passion or interest someone must have about the country or culture of their birth.  You're not the feelings police, and you're definitely not the culture police.", "YTA\n\nShe isn't the reason that racism is a thing. It's extremely common for some families that immigrate to America to not acknowledge their home country & give up their culture. You need to apologize.", "YTA. You profiled her then lashed out when you realized her life experiences were different than yours.", "YTA. You set some unfairly high expectations on her. If your sole reason was that she'd 'hacked the system' that would be one thing but everything leading up to it makes it seem like you have a very stringent idea of what being Latina should look like and that her lack of historical knowledge or ability to speak Spanish somehow makes her less than.", "YTA. You essentially profiled her and was disappointed she didn't fit with your understanding of what a Latina should be. This is a 'You' problem.", "YTA\n\nYou created huge expectations about a person whom you never met or spoke too, then got super pissed off at her when she did not meet those expectations.\n\nAs another poster said, some parents who immigrate to the US want to abandon their culture and language and embrace US culture as their own. This isn't about racism, it's just that some people's experience with their culture is very bad, and they don't want their children to be raised in it.", "Yes YTA. I think **your** comments were racist, offensive, and ignorant, both on account of MJ being Latina and her being an American.\n\nYou did not state whether her race is white or black, so I will assume her skin color does not subject her to discrimination. By US standards, MJ is an American-born person of Hispanic ethnicity and of a demographic that has historically received discrimination solely because of her country of origin and her name. That is more than sufficient for her to receive her scholarship.\n\nYour comments and judgments were based entirely about your experiences and expectations, and did not take any of her experiences or those of people similarly situated into consideration. \"Paper Latina\", while an extremely informal term, is a perfectly descriptive and reasonable term to use.\n\nEverything else is really none of your business. The only thing that people of Latin American origin have in common in the US is that they are divided. I place myself in that category, but not really with much more interest than MJ.", "I\u2019m sorry, YTA. It\u2019s not your business whether she is super into her Argentinian roots. If she wants to only be into US culture, that\u2019s her prerogative. Some people don\u2019t feel strong ties, and she was raised in the US.", "YTA and as you made sweeping assumptions on her based on her place of birth, isnt that one of the definitions of racism, making you the racist?", "YTA\n\nShe and her experiences aren't the reason why racism and discrimination exist. In fact, the one who was being stereotypical, racist and discriminating here was you.\n\nHer personal experience of growing up in the US and being more American in culture than Latina in culture, is HER PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. It's as valid as your experience. It's as acceptable and right as your experience.", "TYA\n\nThe narrator of this story is too self centered and rude to be believable.", "Insulting people you've just met is kind of an asshole move when they're part of a friend circle.  There are better, gentler ways of educating people.", "YTA \n\nYou went way overboard here and assumed she was going to be your \u201cbest friend \u201c before you even met her, then you got all pissy because she didn\u2019t fit the mold you made for her?!   While it was decent of you to try like you did.. you automatically assumed she was going to be the standard you set for her, more than likely embarrassed the shit out of her, and confronted her about things about her that we\u2019re not your business.  Who tf are you to tell someone how they should live their life according to some kind of stereotype YOU actually set for her? Especially since she\u2019s been here since she was 2 months old. ! I\u2019d have thought you were rude and probably said I didn\u2019t want to spend any more time with you either because, while your intentions may have started out good, you completely judged her because she didn\u2019t fit your stereotypical standard of what a Latina should be.  I\u2019m not trying to hurt your feelings but you really crossed the line. And how she got her education is not your business at all", "> I never had a best friend since I moved to the US because of the cultural difference and this was my chance to bond with someone from the same background as me.\n\nWhy did you think she would be your new best friend? JUST because she wasn't born in the US?\n\nYou know you can have friends who don't share your cultural history, right?", "YTA, I\u2019m sorry to say. In America, it\u2019s not ever appropriate to make comments to someone about their background, especially if it\u2019s you saying how you think they should be", "Lol JoJo is the reason for racism?\n\nYTA", "YTA\u2026i\u2019ll just leave this quote here:\n\n \u201cwhen you assume, it makes an ass out of U and Me\u201d", "YTA. First of all you put way to much pressure on this first meeting with her like automatically hoping she\u2019ll become your best friend just because it seemed like she came from a similar background to you. Second of all it\u2019s weird to call someone by a nickname when you haven\u2019t met them before and never heard anyone else refer to them by that nickname. It doesn\u2019t matter if the nickname you used was common where she was born because that\u2019s not a guarantee she would actually like being called it. Finally you made assumptions about her and judged her completely unfairly. You also tried to shame her in front of her friends because she didn\u2019t meet your ridiculous expectations that you decided she should meet just because she was born in Argentina. That is completely unfair to her and extremely rude.", "YTA for attacking her because she was disinterested in her ancestors' culture (many people simply don't care about politics and traditions even if they've been living in the same country since they were born). My judgement would be different if you'd criticise her claiming benefits she's not actually entitled to (I know she is entitled to them formally because of a foreign passport, but what does she bring to the table that's different from a US student?)", "In this terrible, American culture which you apparently embrace (American college, boyfriend, etc.), and scorn (this other girl is an American!? But, but, she is wasn\u2019t born here!You are meltingggggg)\u2026 in this American society, we have a saying:\n\nMIND YOUR OWN DAMNED BUSINESS.  YTA", "ESH. the way she looks down on people from her native country is awful, but she is not the reason people are racist. no member of a marginalized group is responsible for being marginalized. it sounds like she has a lot of internalized racism and directs that at other latam people, but you dont get to control her relationship with her culture. thats something she has to work through on her own time. it would have been fair to call her on her own harmful actions, but it is not fair at all to insinuate that she is responsible for racism against LATAM people", "YTA", "I understand being disappointed about not being able to connect to someone of your heritage, but it was unfair to put those expectations on her and then lash out when she didn\u2019t meet them. She was raised in the United States and that was the culture that her parents chose to raise her with - it\u2019s not surprising or wrong that she identifies with that and not with the country she lived in for a few months as a baby.

However, when she & the friend group we\u2019re laughing about being a paper Latina; which being Latina is something you take seriously, & that was not appropriate. Then, your BF saying you are never invited again was also inappropriate. \n\nInstead of calling everyone an AH, let\u2019s say the best move on your part if you plan to keep dating BF is to talk openly with him about your feelings/ expectations. Then, you may have to apologize/ explain to the friend or friend group. Just bc you want to be understood and be polite with ppl that are important to your BF.

You should at least care about your home country if you're going to profit from it. I have the same scholarship, but I am proud of my culture and whenever I can I try to share it with others (that's why I don't have many friends).\n\nAs for my boyfriend, I don't want to force him to leave his friends, so if he decides it's best for me not to go to meetings with him, I'll respect his decision.", "Honestly you should probably apologize to her and explain yourself and why you realize you were so wrong. Then just accept her as an American, since it seems that\u2019s how she identifies. You might find you guys have more in common culturally, in time, IF she wants to be your friend.", "That last sentence shows a lot of self awareness and courage. That\u2019s exactly it. \n\n Never tell a POC *how* to be a POC.", "This is a really controversial topic. As someone from another background, I take pride in my heritage. But I've met others in my background who don't care whatsoever and shun our heritage. I know people like her, saying deliberately insulting things about their own culture to gain points in the white crowd. I don't like her comments about gaming the system and saying horrible things like calling her relatives uneducated savages and how the one good thing about being from Argentina is that she can get a scholarship. I'm not a fan of her or the friends whatsoever. You don't laugh at such comments, that's just wrong. But you went about this the wrong way. You should've kept quiet and walked away and talked to your boyfriend in private about the things she said and have him raise those points with her privately. Or meet her privately and say hey I'm hurt by your comments and I don't like that you're making fun of Latinos like that. I would greatly appreciate you don't make such comments in front of me. What you do in private and away from me, is up to you.", "Why would you think her parents would call her that? Do you somehow know her parents? \n\nWhy should she care about a country she's never lived in or seen or had any connection to? Why should she care about a country her parents didn't even bother teaching her about?", "She was there a few months. To her, her country is where she grew up, not where she was born. You can think that\u2019s weird but *she* gets to decide how she feels.", "It still would be weird having a total stranger call u by ur nickname", "You incorrectly made a lot of assumptions you should not have. You assumed.. without getting to know her, and maybe your intentions were good but they came off as creepy to her and everyone else", "You didn't have \"high expectations\". You had \"exotic expectations\".\n\nYou expected her to fall into the stereotypes of a different place and culture based on where she was born and what her name was. You expected her to be a wild fact machine and became enraged when she was \"too American\" for your liking.\n\nYou portrayed not the \"crazy latina\", but the crazy racist\".", "Her home country is USA, she was born in Argintina but that doesnt make it her home. She left when she was barely more than a potato and as such its completely her personal choice if shes interested or not in 'her roots'", "It's not to you to judge someone for not caring about a 'home' country that was really never her home.  You didn't mention the 'savages' part in your OP.  I can see that could upset you if you felt that it was a putdown of South American culture in general.  If you think she meant it that way, that would have been important to mention in your OP because then she would be insulting you directly.", "why does she have to care? she grew up in the Usa, so she cares about the Usa. even if she grew up in Argentina for a substantial amount of time, she doesnt have to care about anything.\n\nnot everyone is as focussed on their heritage as you are, and they dont have to be. dont stereotype people.", "That\u2019s a terrible thing for her to say, but it wouldn\u2019t have come up without you pushing.", "It's not your fault for having high expectations, but it's your fault for being an AH.", "I believe she feels that the USA is her home country.  Who are you to tell her differently?  I agree that it's a shame that she doesn't seem to care about it even really like Argentina but that's not up to you.", "You should put the comment she made in the OP.", "Are you serious?  \n\nThat is so deeply offensive I don't even know why you don't already think you're an AH.", "Why do you have the authority to define her culture for her? Or to judge her parents for the decisions they made? How incredible rude and presumptive you are", "That second one sounds like you took it directly from anti-immigrant talking points. She's not pretending she's American. She is.", "1st half of your user name seems to check out.  You\u2019re making yourself look worse.", "Talk about projecting issues!! You're pissed off because she's happy with her life and that's not how you think she should be living it!?? Who do you think you are two tell someone how to live!?\n\nMajor YTA and I wouldn't expect anyone to accept an apology from you with ease\n\nFair play to your boyfriend for trying to be on your side, but I bet he's just as annoyed as his friends are with the problems you're causing", "I know is off topic, but she doesn't look Latina, as you said. She has very fair skin, golden brown hair and green eyes. She's even full of freckles. I know it's racist to assume that all Latin people are tanned and have brown eyes, just to clarify.", "Have you considered that she\u2019s not denying her culture but that her family culture has changed? Culture can be fluid. We incorporate things about where we live into our personal cultures, and take things out we don\u2019t want, all the time. \n\nI\u2019d be willing to bet that even in Argentina there are many different cultures and not everyone is the same. There are variations in every culture.\n\nJewish culture is a perfect example. There was a huge influx of immigrants during and after WW2. And they kept their culture but also adapted it to their new home, and incorporated new things into their culture. Now, American Jewish culture can be very different than European or Israeli Jewish culture.\n\nI do agree that the \u201ccrazy Latina\u201d comment was racist. But your judgements about her sound kind of racist too.", "Culture is environmental not genetic\n\nHer culture is American.", "Did you consider that she might have been embarrassed because you were basically gatekeeping what it means to be Latina?\n\nShe grew up in the US. She doesn\u2019t speak Spanish. She doesn\u2019t know anything about Argentina, because for her it\u2019s where her parents are from but not where she\u2019s from.  All of these things can be true and she can be Latina. She might be very proud of her culture, her culture of a Latina American woman. \n\nYou basically implied she\u2019s not a *real* Latina because she doesn\u2019t have the culture *you* thought she\u2019d have. That\u2019s rude af.\n\nAnd as for hacking the system, if the scholarship is open to people born in other counties then she\u2019s eligible to receive the scholarship. It doesn\u2019t matter if she grew up there or not. Assuming she didn\u2019t lie and provide false information, then she obviously met all the scholarship parameters. You might disagree with the scholarship parameters, but that isn\u2019t about this girl. \n\nYTA", "You might not have many friends because you\u2019re kind of pushy.. which is a turn off for people. You don\u2019t mean any harm. But maybe you come across too strong? I love learning about other cultures! But slow down.. let people learn about you and your culture at their pace, not some standard timeline you\u2019ve set up.  Edited to add.. if you tell everything all at once, what\u2019s left to learn about you? Pace yourself with people.. don\u2019t try so hard.", "Preaching your culture does not make you a good person. How you treat others does. And you've already crossed that bridge. No one is going to think well of you for spitefully attacking a girl simply because she isn't the person you wanted her to be.", "Did it ever occur to you that the reason why she was embarrassed to be a Latina might be because it had never brought her anything but discrimination and prejudice in the US because she wasn't white? In those circumstances, why would she ever have a good opinion of what it is to be a Latina if it's brought her nothing but sadness?", "I wish you well. I don\u2019t know why a lot of people are completely ignoring the fact JoJo is using a heritage she completely ignores (which is so disrespectful) and then has the nerve to laugh about it in front of you\u2026 well, what can I say. If it happened to them, they\u2019d be outraged.", "Her home country is America. And the disadvantage of being born in Argentina or Latin genetics is that many people including you will never accept her as a real American.", "Just FYI white Americans get more upset about being called racist than actually being racist, it's how they hang on to the systemic racism that benefits them most. You should learn this if you are in America.", "It\u2019s about her being proud of using a heritage she doesn\u2019t care about to get scholarships and then laughing about gaming the system in front of OP. That\u2019s gross.", "She is a minority in America, regardless of whether her parents chose to raise her in that culture she will always be seen and at first treated in a way that reflects the struggles a minority will face. That's why she gets the scholarship. Just because she has an easier time adapting and can make jokes that others might appeal to doesn't give you the right to be outraged on others behalf. Stop moralizing the otherization of other cultures, the important aspect of equal opportunity is to help those who struggle with the perception that they are other by the majority.", "How do you know she isn\u2019t proud of her heritage?  To her, her heritage may be that she\u2019s an American and she\u2019s Latina. She gets to decide that. \n\nShe may be tactless about how she talked about the scholarship. I\u2019d be curious about the scholarship parameters, because unless she lied then she obviously qualified and met the requirements. \n\nI went to school with a few people who got scholarships based on being part Native American. They\u2019d never even seen a reservation and couldn\u2019t really tell you anything about Native American history. That didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t Native American and weren\u2019t eligible to receive the scholarships. \n\nBut I do agree the girl sounded insensitive in how she described the scholarship.", "Yeah, my grandfather had the same struggle and was obviously an immigrant. He identified as Canadian - his past was completely behind him, and Canada was his home. But you can be sure he wasn\u2019t using his heritage to get perks and then laughing in the faces of those who still identified with the home country. That\u2019s disgusting.", "Read paragraph 4. That\u2019s how I know.", "OP mentioned in a comment about how Jojo thought her relatives in Argentina were uneducated savages. That's just...wow.", "It's a harsh reality but no one has to be proud of where they come from. Forced patriotism is counter intuitive", "That\u2019s assuming her culture is Argentinian. If she considers herself an American, then that\u2019s her culture. \n\nBut we can agree to disagree.", "I do think that\u2019s super offensive\u2026if she\u2019s saying it because they\u2019re typical Argentinians and she disapproves of the culture.  But to be fair, maybe her relatives are complete jerk assholes and everyone else thinks so too.  \n\nBut I can see how OP, already offended that the girl\u2019s culture wasn\u2019t what she felt it was supposed to be, would automatically assume the first. And maybe that\u2019s what the girl meant, we don\u2019t know.", "She doesn\u2019t have to be proud of where she came from, no. But bragging about using it as a tool (and then insulting it) is next-level arrogance.", "I don\u2019t expect anyone to identify with a culture they weren\u2019t born into. It\u2019s pretending to identify with it for financial gain, and then laughing about it. I\u2019m surprised at how many people don\u2019t find that offensive, but then, it\u2019s not them in the position.\n\nETA : I have all sorts of genetic heritage that I don\u2019t connect with, and you\u2019ll never catch me using any of it to gain perks. And then proudly proclaiming it to people who are connected to that heritage.", "I agree it\u2019s offensive if she pretended to identify with another culture to qualify for the scholarship. That\u2019s why I wanted to know the parameters of the scholarship. The scholarship could simply be open to anyone born outside the US, we don\u2019t know. If that\u2019s the case, she qualifies regardless of culture.  If it\u2019s open to all Latina students, she qualifies. If it\u2019s for people culturally adjusting to the US, then she shouldn\u2019t qualify. But we don\u2019t know, since OP didn\u2019t give details about the scholarship. \n\nBut she was tactless when talking about it."]}
