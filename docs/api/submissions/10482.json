You saw your child receiving affection from an unknown (to you) adult without the presence of your child\u2019s other parent who should\u2019ve been with your child as you weren\u2019t notified that they were no longer able to watch their child as required. I would 1000% be questioning your sanity and worth as a parent if you just happily said \u201csure, stranger I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m totally fine with trusting your version of events on how my child came to be in your care and your motives without question. Please, take my son home with you.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s bizarre to me that a non-parent thinks it\u2019s appropriate to kiss another person\u2019s child - even if that person doesn\u2019t have nefarious intentions towards your child, you have no right to give them a kiss. My mom and sister even ask if it\u2019s alright if they give my child a kiss on the face before doing so and I fully trust them with my child\u2019s well being. Hell, I don\u2019t even touch other people\u2019s kids without consent from the parents and would never try to override what the parents says is ok or not (obviously barring any situation in which I believed a child was in danger and required my intervention). If I had been the parent in this situation, my head would\u2019ve fucking exploded if I just told some stranger that I wasn\u2019t ok with the current situation and they turned around and pretty much said \u201cnice to know, but I\u2019m doing it anyway\u201d.\n\nI\u2019d be reaming my ex out for not only failing to contact me when the ex suddenly became unable to watch our child (which it appears she was obligated to do) but for also putting my our child in the care of someone I don\u2019t know (no family members or well known and trusted mutual friends if you hadn\u2019t be able to come get him immediately) - is she allowing this man to place your child in his car and drive away with him? Does she know his personal background?

It doesn\u2019t really matter because in no uncertain terms should you ever send your kid to an overnight trip with an effective stranger, even if they are friendly. That\u2019s how severe trauma is created.\n\nAnyways I\u2019m gunna say just based on this info, NTA because she was obligated to ask you first, her story changed once you caught her red handed but based on what the neighbor said she broke the agreement and that should be reported/recorded.\n\nI hope you can find an amicable solution to this because the person who suffers the most is your child.
