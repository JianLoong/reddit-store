By the way, it's Saturday...why didn't you say something to the person you saw taking them at that time?\n\nHer dad looks at me with a smirk and raised eyebrows, like he thinks I'm full of shit.\n\nI say, \"look man do you want to go into my backyard and see for yourself?\" He says sure, so I unlock my back gate and wave them in. Father and daughter go in look around briefly and walk out. I ask if they are satisfied, dad says \"I guess we'll call the city\" I say, sarcastically because I'm irritated at this point, \"that sounds like a great idea, good luck with that\"\n\nDaughter says \"OK dude, you don't need to be so hostile to us, we're just looking for our trash cans\".\n\nI say, uhh, no you came to my place accusing me of stealing from you, I tell you I dont have what you're looking for, I SHOW you I don't have them by voluntarily letting you into my backyard, you offer no apology for the intrusion or accusation, but I'm rude and hostile because I sarcastically agreed with you about going to the city? OK lady. I lock my back gate start walking back up my driveway/walkway, look back and see them standing near my car talking.\n\nI ask if I can help them with anything else, the daughter comes up and asks me to repeat myself. I ask again if I can help them with anything. Daughter again tells me to stop speaking to them so rudely. I say OK you know what, have a good one this conversation is over.\n\nAn hour later she knocks on the door again asking if I know when my duplex neighbors will be home because they want to check with them too. I say no, I don't know when they'll be home, and I'm not giving their personal information out. She asks if I will at least ask them about it.\n\nI say no, and suggest knocking on their door some other time, maybe they'll be home. She gives me a super dirty look and leaves. Like fuck you and what the fuck in one look.\n\nWife says maybe I was a little too harsh and should've just agreed to ask my duplex neighbors for them. I feel like the way they went about \"asking\" me was super out of line, literally just accusing me lmao. I don't feel obligated to help people like that at all after that kind of interaction.\n\nAITA here for refusing to help them find their trash cans?", "created_utc": 1691881072, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15piaq1/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_neighbors_find_their/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why don't they just call the city and ask for a new trash can?  It happens all the time where I live.  Sometimes the garbage truck accidentally drops the whole can in the truck.

Should be an easy call and he\u2019ll get a brand new one.", "NTA they blatantly accused you of taking their trash can but wouldn\u2019t back down when confronted with the truth. They can go make up more lies with their search elsewhere.", "NTA  \n\n\nTwice in my life I've gone looking for missing trashcans. First time, I spotted my can in a neighbour's driveway. (My can was brand new, so easily spotted)  I opened the lid to check and there was my door number inside.   \n\n\nKnocked to tell the neighbour that I was taking my can back. No answer.   \n\n\nUsed a spade in their driveway to decant their dirty diapers from my can into the can I found sitting at the roadside - presumably theirs. (I dragged it into their driveway for them.)  \n\n\nSecond time, it was a different neighbour. By then, I had my door number all over the can. They'd locked it in their yard - I could see it through the fence. It was sitting next to their own can plus yet another can that wasn't theirs.  \n\n\nI knocked on the door and the teenage daughter was sent to answer. I told them I needed the can back. They left it out on trash day.   \n\n\nI was so annoyed that they weren't even courteous enough to return it to my house that I knocked on their door and complained. (They'd actually removed the can from in our front garden.) I just told them not to do it again. This time, the wife answered...She claimed she was a police officer and I was committing breach of the peace. (I was being polite; she was lying about being a police officer.)  \n\n\nIn your case, the neighbour had no reason to think that you had their trash cans.  You behaved impeccably.", "NTA.\n\nHere's a hack for anyone living close to others: write your house number on your bins. Then there's no confusion later.", "Yeah I've lost a can before at the last place I lived, and had my cans skipped so they were still full when I got home. I just call the city, they deal with it immediately. IDK why they accused me of taking their cans, it was weird af. The daughter talks for the dad because I assume the dad doesnt speak English very much or very well. He's an old Mexican guy.", "I don\u2019t see what OP did that was rude. He was accused of theft and allowed his accusers to look around his property. After not seeing their missing items, they didn\u2019t thanked him for his help or apologize. Then they come back and ask try to deputize him in the investigation. If anyone was rude in this case it was the trash an seeking neighbors.", "NTA They are not worth knowing.", "[deleted]", "Again what specifically did OP do? By agreeing that they should contact the city or by refusing to get involved in the investigation after letting them search his premises? Where exactly did he miss an opportunity to deescalate the trashcan seekers?", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m not trying to change your mind; I was genuinely curious about how you felt OP was rude to the people that came to his house and accused him of theft. Personally, I thought the trashcan seekers were rude so I was wondering if there was something I missed.", "NTA. If your neighbor saw someone taking his trash cans he clearly knows it wasn't you. Your neighbors are rude and weird. \n\nThis isntbyour issue and they shouldn't expect you yo approach your neighbor", "NTA\n\nThey set the tone to begin with. When you pointed out the lack of apology about the false accusation and they still didn't apologize, that said everything.", "I\u2019m in the UK and we put our door numbers on our bins, you can buy the door number stickers on Amazon. Would save any hassle going forward as they are literally labelled. NTA", "Wow. You're a genius. Why has nobody else ever thought of this? Did you come up with this idea all on your own?", "NTA. you were so polite.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust tell them to bugger off, not YOUR drama.", "No need to act like a dick, mate.", "NTA.", "NTA", "As I found, that makes no difference with some people.", "I'm also in the UK.  Two of my neighbours appear to ignore the numbers and go for whichever bin is newest/cleanest."]}
