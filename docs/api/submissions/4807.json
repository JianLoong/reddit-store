Grow up!", "YTA don\u2019t litter bro in some countries it\u2019s illegal and in the states you can get charged up to $500 for littering you should thank the old man for telling you not to brake the law, and be thankful that he wasn\u2019t a cop smh", "YTA - why are you even asking? If your sense of \u2018How to behave\u2019 is fucked up enough to even begin to think this is acceptable you need to do some serious learning, and quickly.

Who do you expect to pick up trash you throw on the ground?", "YTA. Wow grow TF up.", "Yta both for littering, and for being offended when someone told you to pick up after yourself. The ground you littered on didn\u2019t belong to you. It\u2019s not your space or your house. You shouldn\u2019t have to be told to pick up your garbage. Especially a nasty tissue, like you think it\u2019s someone else\u2019s job to touch your garbage? A literal tissue you blew your snot in? And you were OFFENDED.

Years ago I worked as a gardener for my local authority. The amount of rubbish we cleared out of all our sites was disgusting.

So wrong to expect others to clean up your mess.", "I'm more baffled he's had to come here and ask! It's literally common sense.", "Especially a used tissue.
