And our sanitation services suck. I used to not care what other did before going to college. In my college town I started to because waste bins are plentiful and everyone cared. \n\nWhat troubles me is how everyone is not saying that old man is TA for harassing you for a paper tissue. Like he is obviously not in the right in the head especially if he followed you. You are still a minor and I\u2019m not okay with people justifying creepy behavior like that for littering. That\u2019s not going to make that huge of environmental impact honestly. The guy should be going into activism to challenge real polluters like corporations.
