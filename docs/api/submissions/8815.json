It's not that hard to not make it about you for just 1 day, if your brother is unwilling to cooperate and it's not because of allergies then he's just being selfish and immature.", "NTA\n\nAn unwanted gift that is forced on you is not really a gift so much as a performance of generosity.", "Were your bother 15, yes. At 25, NTA.", "NTA. Organize your own birthday dinner. Invite your friends and family and if your brother and father choose not to go, that's too bad, you'll just enjoy your day without them.", "NTA  \nIt's supposed to be you pick where you want to eat. Picky brother doesn't get to be the center of the attention on your birthday.", "Instead of asking your father, you should maybe ask your brother first. Send him the menu and let him decide if he comes or not.\nNTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like he has an allergy or anything. \n\nThis is your brother being a giant baby and your dad babying your brother. Shocker or a connection there. \n\nYou\u2019ve done enough accommodating. He\u2019s a grown man now. He can suck it up or not go. The point of the dinner is the celebration of your birth and has nothing to do with him.", "NTA\n\nYour brother can order off of the children's menu.", "NTA. I really don't love Vietnamese food (even Chinese food I don't really like and usually won't eat more than an egg roll or to.) Not only am I fine with eating these foods on someone else's birthday, but my husband likes them so sometimes I'll just say sounds fine to me, I like egg rolls and have some leftovers if I'm still hungry.\n\nIf he doesn't like Indian eat naan. NOBODY dislikes naan. It's not fair that you never get to have what you like. You should say you are going through a vegetarian phase, so you won't have anything to eat at a cheeseburger or steakhouse place. Can't he just *once* eat a snack before a meal and try munching some food that isn't a burger? Why can't you be picky too?\n\nPS- I am also vegetarian, and if we are all choosing what to eat, sure I like picking a place with a veggie option or two. If it's a B-Day though, or someone else feels strongly, I make it work. Food just isn't as important as celebrating family, and the person whose birthday it is should be the celebrated one. They should get to have an amazing meal accompanied by smiling family. If there was one cuisine he didn't like it might even be different but you must be so sick of burgers by now. It's just not really fair.\n\nIf your Dad still gives you a hard time, it might be worth it to suggest a vegan restaurant you would like to try. When he says that's even worse, try Ethiopian. I bet they'll all compromise on the Indian place just fine. And who knows, it may be the new family favorite?\n\nMy family got Indian once in 2003 from a local restaurant. For Christmas Eve, the majority of birthdays, and every major Holiday, we've all agreed on ordering take out from this restaurant for twenty years. We are super white and I wouldn't call us uber cultured when I was 13 in 2003. Indian food is good as f\\*ck. He would probably like it if he tried it. Might I recommend Manter Paneer with lots of naan? Malayee Kofta is also crazy good. No spice for your bro though. He needs to suck it up and come. But he won't want spice in his.\n\nAnd get samosas! If you live in the midwest, let me know what letter your state starts with, because if you are close, you have to try to our place. IT IS SO GOOD.\n\nSesame Gobi is also killer. I like to mix it with Manter Paneer.", "NTA. I\u2019m a very picky eater myself but I either try to find something to eat or if I know I won\u2019t, I eat something beforehand like a sandwich (or he could get a burger somewhere and go eat it beforehand). If it bothers someone so much like even the sight of it (I\u2019d hope it didn\u2019t go that far), I\u2019d be just as happy to do the \u201cyou guys go eat I\u2019ll join you in a bit\u201d plan too.\n\nYou deserve some happiness on your birthday too and it\u2019s truly no big deal at all to eat something first or later. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll force feed him food he doesn\u2019t like.", "Your brother can ask for very mild.  Problem solved.  I'd do the same.  Your life doesn't revolve around your brother.

Your father is the one who makes your birthday about your brother.", "Are you sure he doesn't ACTUALLY have sensory issues? Grown adults who are labelled \"picky eaters\" often do. It's the reason they're picky.", "Or naan! Naan is literally the best bread in the world. And they have flavors at my place. Garlic is my husband's fave. If I have an upset tummy, nothing does it naan. I can not be able to eat anything, but give me naan and I will eat multiple pieces, and it is so mild and delicious that not only does it still taste amazing but it usually seems to cure whatever has made me nauseous. I ate a lot of it when I had COVID if I recall. Oh oh, and then I had a lot of the sauce from the Manter Paneer because it was like broth. But only after my stomach felt better.", "Honestly, if they want to pull this kind of crap, they can both stay home and I'd go celebrate on my own.  Why should OP put herself  last on her own fkn birthday?", "My sister was a fussy eater as a child, not only that but she had good reasons (was very sick throughout childhood and developed quite a lot of fears around eg choking or getting food poisoning, as well as some drugs making food taste weird). My parents didn\u2019t bend restaurant choices around her and would either make sure she had had a big snack before hand, or just find something she would eat (fries, plain rice, bread etc). They were kind and patient and didn\u2019t complain if she said she just wanted a drink and to eat something later. But ultimately they taught her how to manage having different needs to those around her without it being a big deal. Honestly I think it help d her become less picky because she would start to try things around her. If she had been catered to the whole time it cements the feeling that she can\u2019t go to other restaurants.", "I mean not everyone who\u2019s super picky for no medical condition is entitled though. So many people are very picky but they don\u2019t make it anyone\u2019s issue besides their own. I hate so many kinds of foods but I\u2019ll still go places others want to go and just eat before or after. Of course the brother is TA and OP is most definitely deserving of choosing her place to go, just saying in general.", "Don\u2019t you dare insult the Dino nuggies", "I suspect the saucy dishes would throw off my picky relatives.  I plan on starting them with Tandoori chicken and plain naan if I ever get them to my Indian restaurant.

We have ALL the best food!", "My favorite restaurant growing up was a migrant owned Mexican restaurant, in the 28 years I ate there I slowly watched the authenticity disappear, I asked Javi [the owner] why and he said at this point even his children prefer the food the \"American\" way. I felt bad for him because he worked so hard to come to the US and open his own restaurant, just for his kids to change things more and more the closer he got to retirement.\n\nIt's still excellent food, but it's also stuff you could probably Google \"fast easy cheap Mexican recipes\" and find, well, fast, easy, and cheap Mexican recipes....", "Dooo it"]}
