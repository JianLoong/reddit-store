Our local Indian restaurants do things like chicken and chips and omelettes, and from other comments this seems very common. I'm sure your brother won't go hungry. And even if he does, he won't starve.", "NTA. Says your selfish. What's he call making you pick a place your brother will eat. Make plans and meet up with a couple friends at the Indian Restaurant. While you're at it get the cake you like. Your brother gets two birthday dinners and cakes a year. Sorry not much of a tradition if you think about it.", "NTA - don\u2019t even go. Make a stand that it isn\u2019t fair to you that you\u2019ve never actually gotten to pick where you want to go and as a result, you are not spending your birthday with them. Go to the Indian place by yourself and get your own cake. My mom was like this as well growing up (she hated trying new things) and I had to practically beg to go to a Greek restaurant one year because I was so sick of only ever getting to eat Italian and roast chicken. You\u2019re an adult, just because your dad is willing to take you out doesn\u2019t mean you have to go if he won\u2019t let you actually pick.", "NTA. I have many issues with food (some I can't eat for allergies, some I can't stand texture/smell), but I've never asked other people to pick a different place to accomodate me, I just search something I may like, otherwise I eat before/after. Brother can enjoy the meal together and eat what he wants later.", "My elderly mom lived in a small rural town. A Mexican restaurant opened and she mentioned one day how much she liked it. I asked her what she got there and she said, \"They have the best cheeseburgers!\"", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s been engineered so that your brother effectively gets to celebrate 2 birthdays a year whilst you don\u2019t get to celebrate one.  I\u2019d tell your Dad that the tradition of you being treated as unimportant and inferior has now ended and from now on you\u2019ll celebrate with people who want to make your day about you and celebrate in the way that makes you happy.", "No way, you should go to eat where you want for your birthday. Your brother is adult and need to act like it. You should not be restricted for YOUR birthday. \n\nParticularly, when he is just picky eater and there are no allergies, etc. \n\nAs a picky eater when I go out with family or friends, happy to go where they want, I can find something to eat or come for the company and eat before or after. If it\u2019s such a big issues, then he doesn\u2019t go, just because you are siblings, does not mean you have celebrate with him \n\nYour brother needs to grow a pair and your father needs to treat him as a adult and not child", "NTA. Don\u2019t cave", "NTA. Your brother is an adult and can learn to suck it up for his family for a meal that does not revolve around him.", "Nta divorce the brother", "Nta\n\nIt's your birthday", "Nta it's your b day. Bro can either not come, or find something on the menu.  Going with dad and bring brother home McD is a good compromise.\n\nFor ex, I am 35. I really like Primanti brothers.   No one else in my family cares for the coleslaw.and fries on the sandwich. Guess where I go to lunch ony bday?  Primanti brothers! My mom either sucks it up for one meal or orders a salad.  And it's the same on her bday.  She wants to go somewhere I don't like?  I suck it up.", "NTA! We do this for our birthdays too!\nHe can just not go if he has issues with the food\nI\u2019m one of 5 kids and if we don\u2019t like the food we just say happy birthday and that\u2019s it\nAlthough we pay for ourselves, our mum pays for the birthday \u2018kid\u2019 *lol*\nWe tend to either eat at home and we pick what we want to eat, or generally go to buffet style places", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t set foot in an indian restaurant, the smell of curry makes me want to vomit. \n\nThat said i would never expect anyone else to compromise on their celebration, as the picky one i would be happy to meet for dessert, an activity or whatever after the dinner, to celebrate. \n\nYour dad needs to stop coddling your brother.", "NTA. It's your birthday, not his. If they still disagree, You can always cancel the celebration. If they get pissed, remember them it's their fault...", "NTA you 've been compromising your whole life. This is one time YOU get to choose which place you want to eat. Brother can suck it up or not go. Those are his menu options.", "NTA. Ngl I would have raised my beverage as if it was the finest vintage, looked at \u2018brother\u2019 and said \u201chappy birthday.\u201d Then sipped. And when asked simply said \u201cwell since it\u2019s completely about him it Must be his birthday we are celebrating right? I mean if it was about me it would have been something I wanted to do not what brother wanted right?\u201d And then left. \n\nBut I can be the queen of petty sooo\u2026..", "NTA, your brother needs to grow up and your dad needs to stop enabling his  entitled behavior. Food allergies are one thing but having the palette of a toddler, just no", "NTA besides it's your birthday and it's still one day of the year when you can be selfish and you can be entitled but not as much as you think you can. All I'm saying is that you would not be the ah for wanting to choose a different place. Besides has your brother ever changed birthday destinations for you? And if not then why are you doing this you're a grown adult and if your dad has want to come to comprimise for you then I think you should spend Birthday by yourself and enjoy some Solitude and peace of mind.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is an adult and if he is offended that you are choosing where you want to go on your birthday instead of catering to his picky palate he needs to grow up. You are allowed to be selfish with things like this on your birthday. I was the same way as you on my birthday, choosing someplace I knew everyone would like but I stopped that a few years ago. Life is to short.", "NTA. If this is supposed to be the day to eat what YOU WANT and do what you want to do, you should get exactly that. Your brother can suck it up one day a year. He's 25 years old, for goodness sake!", "NTA. It's your birthday. You sacrificed enough meals for your brother. He can suck it up for once", "Great, but honestly, not every situation requires compromise.  Sometimes the 'compromise' is 'I understand why you can't join me.'", "So happy to hear this nice solution. I hope everyone was happy with it. \nI'm the picky eater (probably do have some sensory issue/autism/anxiety disorder) and it makes me so nervous going to new/different places. When I'm invited, of course it's about the person who's celebration it is, so I either look of the menu can be adapted, or don't go. It's a really stressful experience for me and I would like to hope your brother was appreciative of the way you handled it \ud83d\ude42", "You should really take this more seriously and bring up the point that your brother might have either just sensory issues or something more general like autism.\nDiagnosis for autism can be missed in childhood but still be done in adulthood :)\n\nThings would improve a lot with the correct diagnosis", "Good job OP.  I'm glad your Dad will have his family together and you don't feel cheapened by having a McMeal.   The new restaurant experience is an excellent idea and is distinctly 'you'.", "Your brother is a grown man, not twelve years old. He shouldn't need pandered too. Plus Indian restaurants often have chips and European/bland items on the menu.", "Coffee cake can be a cake meant to be eaten with coffee, not necessarily made with coffee. On the other hand, tiramisu is considered a delicacy to many, and it is made with espresso or coffee.", "I was assuming the same thing even reading the original post. OP is still NTA and should be able to have her birthday anywhere she wants, but this is something often dismissed.", "Or super tasters. Like, spicy or flavorful food is just overwhelming. Kids have more powerful taste buds than adults and this is why they\u2019re picky eaters. Some adults retain this and are then known as picky.", " \n\nPicky bros can't be the center of attention on your birthday.", "That's what I was thinking.  Surely even a picky eater will eat plain naan.  When my kid was in his picky toddler phase he'd still eat naan.\n\nThere's also white rice and usually some kind of fried cheese option.  And he could have a mango laasi.", "Exactly this. \n\nWe all have to make compromises to make relationships work, seems like OP has been doing *all of it* her entire life. \n\nBrother has four perfectly reasonable options \n\n1. Don't go\n\n2. Go but try and find something he can tolerate; there's probably a menu option or two for obnoxious people like him\n\n3. Be adventurous for once in his damn life and try something new\n\n4. Grab a burger before or after, and just hang out. \n\nI can understand pickiness from my four year old, but I really struggle to have any empathy for picky adults.", "Tiramisu barely has any coffee flavour tbh.

I'm sure its all pre packaged.

We host the largest Dhaliwal celebration outside of India.  So many great restaurants. Huge population.  My son's favorite bland food is the grilled cheese dosa at dharma dosa.", "Chicken tenders aren't eurocentric its just kid food lol.
