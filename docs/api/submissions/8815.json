On mobile, so there may be weird formatting issues.\n\nSo my (F28) dad has a tradition for birthdays for my brother (M25) and I where every year he picks us up a dessert of our choosing from our local bakery, takes out to eat \u201cwherever we want,\u201d and then we go do an activity like bowling or movies or whatever else we pick. I know I\u2019m very lucky to have a dad that does that even after we\u2019re adults and have moved out of the house.\n\nThe only thing is, my brother is an extremely picky eater, so since we were kids I\u2019ve sort of always gotten stuck only choosing places to eat where he\u2019ll actually eat. My brother will pretty much only go out to eat at steakhouses or burger joints. So every year for my birthday since we were kids, that\u2019s where I\u2019ve \u201cchosen\u201d to go because he won\u2019t go anywhere else. Or I\u2019ve \u201cchosen\u201d to eat vanilla cupcakes because he won\u2019t eat the coffee cake I like.\n\nThis year, when my dad asked me where I\u2019d like to eat, I told him there was this new Indian place I\u2019d heard about that I really wanted to try. He asked if I could pick somewhere else because my brother won\u2019t eat Indian food. I told him I was kind of tired of eating cheeseburgers for my birthday just because my brother is picky, and asked if my dad and I could have dinner together, and then pick my brother up to go out afterwords. He accused me of being selfish, so I sort of just dropped the point and stopped texting him about it.\n\nAm I being an asshole? I know it\u2019s not that deep to go eat burgers or whatever, but I do kind of feel like it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019ve had to center birthday activities around my brother\u2019s preferences my whole life. I don\u2019t know though, I might be being super immature.

The tradition is that your brother and you pick places your brother wants to go to. Show these posts to your dad. You ARE NOT being selfish, your dad and brother are.

I am sure your 25 y/o brother can order off the kids menu where there will be something more suitable to his taste.", "NTA at all and I would make sure your dad knew how disappointed you are in him that your choices are invalidated because of your brother and that his clear favoritism is frankly sexist and gross. I see that you are an introvert but maybe take a stand and refuse to take part in this tradition of favoritism and enjoy your wine with a favorite activity of your own.

Your brother is a grown-ass adult.  If he doesn't like it, he doesn't have to go.  You've been more than accommodating, and if the rule is that you're allowed to pick where you eat on your birthday, then you're allowed to pick where you eat on your birthday.  I'm assuming your brother doesn't consider what you'd prefer to eat when picking for himself.", "I assume you two don't share the same birthday . It's perfectly reasonable to ask for this. Talk to your brother about this and see what his opinion is. Your brother could go with you and not eat if that's what he wants or not go at all. Your father could have tried to understand your point of view as well, but he didn't. \n\nBy the way, there are correct responses to this.

Your dad is a big AH though, and is showing favoritism.", "It's so frustrating to always be forced to accommodate the PITA (not the bread kind).

My MIL decided they were joining us one year for the spouse's birthday and tried to dictate the place. Nope.

Dude'a a grown ass man, and needs to be treated accordingly, not like a toddler.\nI hope you get to go somewhere of *your choosing on *your birthday.", "NTA.  The choice is supposed to be yours, and a lot of the responses you've gotten point out viable options for your brother.\n\nWhy would you default to burgers if you chose a different place, though? There are tons of choices between Indian and burgers.", "NTA. If your brother can't finds something he likes (steak and burgers) at must about any7 restaurant, then he's not picky, he's entitled.", "NTA. Your brother is spoiled. Let him go get a burger before you all go to lunch. He can sit in the Indian restaurant and eat a piece of naan or some white rice. I assume he can cope with simple white carbs? And of course you should get the cake you want for your birthday. If he MUST have cake and can\u2019t cope with coffee cake (did someone beat him with a cinnamon stick when he was young?), you get your coffee cake and daddy can pick up a vaniwa cupcake for his widdle boy.

I\u2019m a huge introvert so if I do anything besides hanging out with my family, it\u2019s just taking a day to myself alone with a bottle of wine or something.", "But why? He is 25 years old not a toddler. He needs to grow up and recognize the world does not revolve around him.", "It is OK to not celebrate with people who don't really want to celebrate you. Take the day to yourself.  If you are uncomfortable eating out by yourself, get some takeout, a bottle of wine and your favorite streaming service. Sometimes a party of one is better than pretending to celebrate you.", "Got it.  I'm going NTA since it is one thing to be a parent dealing with multiple kids, one being a picky eater, at a restaurant; but it becomes very different with adults or even older teens.  I'm vegan and have food allergies and I would never get in the way of someone's choice of venue for a celebration.  I have learned to adapt and barely even think about stuff like that now.  Diner food?  Cool, put some avo on that salad, etc.\nStill, imo it might not be worth the argument when you can always plan out the solo celebration and look forward to and enjoy the heck out of that."]}
