She huffed and puffed to her brother about it, but he was like \"There really aren't many places dad likes and it is HIS birthday\". So when we get there and we're all walking in, my mom said something about how \"we all have to mindful about certain people's dietary restrictions when we pick restaurants\" and my older sister just flat out said \"Actually, no we don't, because it's not your birthday\" LOL My mom fell silent and when she wasn't in ear shot, my uncle and his wife laughed so hard (they still bring it up sometimes too).
