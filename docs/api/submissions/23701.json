Last year in May we had job openings for a teaching position. We had several promising applicants, but we decided to hire a woman fresh out of graduate school [mid-20s F]. I was excited to have her work for us because she had infectious enthusiasm.\n\nUnfortunately, starting from the earliest assembly last September, my patience for her began to wane. She is the most two-faced individual I've ever seen. During meetings and private conversations she's fine. But if you put a 16-year-old student in hearing distance, she immediately becomes intolerable.\n\nI do a lot of disciplinary committee work at my school. During our first assembly when I instructed the students on manners involving their phones and classroom etiquette, I saw some in her general area snickering. I later learned from a colleague that she was sarcastically saying \"OK?\" after every sentence I uttered.\n\nLater, when I supervised one of her lessons, it seemed fine. She was obviously new to teaching, but it was passable instruction. On my way out, I overheard her saying \"OK he's gone everyone, do whatever you want,\" met with laughter from the students.\n\nEarlier this year, I realized that while I had finished our department textbook for 11th graders and was moving into exam preparation, she had only done half. I happen to share a student with her who is one of my advanced courses, and when I asked him what they did in her class, he awkwardly answered a lot of chatting and free time. I warned her about class time management.\n\nAt the end of May we had our year-end tests. Since my school has an accelerated curriculum, we do not actually make these tests; they are written by a college prep school with the SATs and IELTS exams in mind. Any students who fail to achieve a certain score on these tests must go to summer school. \n\nMy students did fine. 91% pass rate, which is about normal. Her students did terribly. 54% pass rate. This is the lowest I have ever seen in my 20-year tenure at this school. She offered to teach summer courses to them but I informed her she would be doing no such thing. Instead I divided the work up among other teachers.\n\nLast week I had a student complaining about summer courses and asking me why we couldn't amend the rules. I told him that once his grades were satisfactory he would be fine. I then tacked on, \"And I apologize for your previous teacher's conduct and incompetence. I'm sure you've noticed many of the other students here were in her class.\" \n\nThe next morning I got a call from her. Apparently my comment had spread like wildfire and gotten back to her. She was furious and called me unprofessional. I responded that she has caused a lot of trouble for our department and the students aren't happy with her, which she denied.\n\nNow I wonder if my comments went too far against her, despite her poor teaching.", "created_utc": 1690955294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g09bz/aita_for_telling_a_class_that_their_previous/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s obviously useless but you\u2019re her boss - and your conduct was super unprofessional. Did you give her warnings etc during the year? Or just let her fuck up and then ran around badmouthing her??

I can\u2019t believe that there\u2019s no other ways to find out if kids are that far behind until the end of the year.\n\nSo there\u2019s problems that you *know* are happening. Was there no spring tests or evaluations? No grades or tests given?\n\nSo she messed up, you ignored it, and those students are stuck in summer school.\n\nYour complete lack of professionalism pointing it out to the students sucks too. I would be livid if I was one of the students parents.", "Honestly, ESH. Teacher shouldn\u2019t be so immature but you also seem equally as insufferable to work with. It sounds like you\u2019re in a mild position of influence. Instead of bad-mouthing the teacher behind her back TO A STUDENT, consider guiding her instead.", "YTA.\n\nYou have been aware of problematic behavior for almost a year, and your only actions to address it have been - warning her about class time management?\n\nYou\u2019re the department head. This falls on you. It\u2019s far too late to take appropriate action; and now, you\u2019re helping her build a case against you and the school with your inappropriate comments.", "YTA. You shouldn't have said that to a student, no matter how true. You should have said that to the teacher's face or to the principal. It's concerning how badly her students performed under her instruction, but you shouldn't bad mouth her to them.", "In a professional environment YTA. I\u2019ve been there. You should have let things go through disciplinary channels and not drop informal comments like that in the workplace. \nYour frustration is understandable, but you could tell she\u2019s buddies with the kids and nothing will be kept from her. \nHope the school doesn\u2019t make you the bad guy. \n\nAnother alternative was to have sat her down and tried to mentor her to up her standards. Maybe another of those you supervise can still help do that.\n\nEdit: autocorrect", "I'm not sure about the licensing board in your area, but, the TQS in my area explicitly states that you can't shit talk other teachers publicly.", "YTA\n\nyes, she\u2019s incompetent at her job and she needs to be reprimanded for that - but to badmouth her in front of a literal student is NOT the way to go. that\u2019s unprofessional as f*** and you as head of department should have known better", "YTA for telling the students this. This is an adult matter and should be between faculty.", "Honestly shocked by all the Y T As here. Everyone in here talking about how you were unprofessional by talking to the kid like that but personally I don\u2019t think so. The new teacher was being super unprofessional and rude by undermining you throughout the year. It\u2019s not even like you did nothing to stop it either since you told her to manage her class better, but again she didn\u2019t listen. You cannot just micromanage and hover over everything she does because you have your own things to do as well. When that student was upset that they had to take summer school you were right to tell them that it wasn\u2019t their fault and that their teacher failed them and the rest of their class as a teacher. OP you\u2019re NTA.", "YTA, your main job is to think of the best for your students. But telling the student wasn't the best option, instead you should have gone to the principal (or whoever decides about the teachers) to talk.", "Do you intend to have her back next year? Do you want the students to complain or do you want to complain to administration? You were involved in the hiring process , are you involved in the firing process?", "Yta\n\nIf there's an incompetent teacher in your department it's because you hired them.\n\nThat was your decision and your screw up.\n\nYou were apologising for the poor teacher. Has she been fired. An apology is empty words without actions! If she had been fired it would have been fine to say. If she is still in the school it's an unprofessional act undermining her in front of students.", "You were correct, and saying what you said probably felt good, but those kind of comments never seem to help. Anytime I\u2019ve said things like that I end up regretting it. Not sure I\u2019d call you an asshole, but I would have kept those comments to myself.", "YTA. \n\nWhy would you even broach that topic with the students?  How do you think it will affect their relationship to education? You just essentially told them the private education their parents pay for is subpar. At you best you deprived them of accountability and at worst you demoralized them and might cause them to lose faith in educational institutions. You were unprofessional and there was no need to try to demean her to the students. Also you hired and supervised her so how does it reflect on you?\n\nHer subpar results should have been a moment to reflect on a growth path for her. I would expect she has a mentor who is providing her with frequent constructive feedback (manage your time better is too vague but this is a reddit post I assume you were just summarizing). As a new teacher she needs lots of guidance and clear outcomes outlined to her. Maybe that was done. That doesn't excuse her actions or her results. Speaking directly with her and with your administrators is the correct outlet for your frustrations, not a snide remark to students.", "YTA. You were unprofessional. The fact that the other teacher is also unprofessional doesn't mean you can or should be too. Quite the opposite, in fact - it makes it even more important that you're completely professional. You failed.", "ESH", "Gently YTA. \n\nIt was unprofessional and inappropriate. It was also probably unnecessary - the students are not idiots, they would have been very aware of her incompetence and already drawn their own conclusions. You didn't need to spell it out.", "YTA. I worked in education for years (everywhere between prek-10th). While talking shit about your coworkers is not a good look, you NEVER bring it into a classroom. You fucked up royally here.", "Yta for involving the student in your gripe against the teacher. Reprimand her or caution her but don't talk about her behind her back to a student", "ESH but when she called you, you should\u2019ve just said ok, ok, ok.\n\nGnomesayin?", "OK, you probably shouldn't have apologised on her behalf to the other student.  That was a bit unprofessional.  However, NTA overall - she does sound bloody incompetent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You need to talk to HER. ESH", "This is a good point but might not be as alarming as one thinks (a student contacting a teacher vice versa). There's a lot of educational apps/platforms such as Blackboard, Class Dojo, Canvas, etc., aimed at  providing virtual education forums that are used for a myriad of reasons (homework assignments are the most obvious case use). All of these services offer some type of functionality to communicate with your teacher if you have questions and the like. Also schools usually publish teacher's contact details (email) to help facilitate teacher-parent communication.\n\nThe fact OP' comment got back to the new teacher in 2023 is not surprising at all and OP should have been aware this was very possible.\n\nEdit/P.S.: Anyways, good point but that's not necessarily a red flag in 2023. We'd need more info before you could jump to that conclusion.", ">You have been aware of problematic behavior for almost a year, and your only actions to address it have been - warning her about class time management?\n\nThis jumped out at me, too.\n\nAlso, OP knew that this teacher was *way* behind in her teaching. That should've triggered an immediate meeting with her to discuss her progress and to put a plan in place with support. It sounds to me like OP allowed his personal beef to get in the way of working with her and saw an opportunity to badmouth her to her *students*.\n\nWhat a toxic, unprofessional attitude for a department head of all people to have.", "You're right, it's not necessarily a red flag. But the situation has far too many yellow flags for my liking. If I were OP, I'd at least want to initiate an investigation so that I could rule it out.\n\nEven if nothing uncouth happened, this teacher constantly seeking approval from teenagers is making it so that she can't do her job which is to educate."]}
