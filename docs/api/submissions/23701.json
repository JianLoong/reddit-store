Last year in May we had job openings for a teaching position. We had several promising applicants, but we decided to hire a woman fresh out of graduate school [mid-20s F]. I was excited to have her work for us because she had infectious enthusiasm.\n\nUnfortunately, starting from the earliest assembly last September, my patience for her began to wane. She is the most two-faced individual I've ever seen. During meetings and private conversations she's fine. But if you put a 16-year-old student in hearing distance, she immediately becomes intolerable.\n\nI do a lot of disciplinary committee work at my school. During our first assembly when I instructed the students on manners involving their phones and classroom etiquette, I saw some in her general area snickering. I later learned from a colleague that she was sarcastically saying \"OK?\" after every sentence I uttered.\n\nLater, when I supervised one of her lessons, it seemed fine. She was obviously new to teaching, but it was passable instruction. On my way out, I overheard her saying \"OK he's gone everyone, do whatever you want,\" met with laughter from the students.\n\nEarlier this year, I realized that while I had finished our department textbook for 11th graders and was moving into exam preparation, she had only done half. I happen to share a student with her who is one of my advanced courses, and when I asked him what they did in her class, he awkwardly answered a lot of chatting and free time. I warned her about class time management.\n\nAt the end of May we had our year-end tests. Since my school has an accelerated curriculum, we do not actually make these tests; they are written by a college prep school with the SATs and IELTS exams in mind. Any students who fail to achieve a certain score on these tests must go to summer school. \n\nMy students did fine. 91% pass rate, which is about normal. Her students did terribly. 54% pass rate. This is the lowest I have ever seen in my 20-year tenure at this school. She offered to teach summer courses to them but I informed her she would be doing no such thing. Instead I divided the work up among other teachers.\n\nLast week I had a student complaining about summer courses and asking me why we couldn't amend the rules. I told him that once his grades were satisfactory he would be fine. I then tacked on, \"And I apologize for your previous teacher's conduct and incompetence. I'm sure you've noticed many of the other students here were in her class.\" \n\nThe next morning I got a call from her. Apparently my comment had spread like wildfire and gotten back to her. She was furious and called me unprofessional. I responded that she has caused a lot of trouble for our department and the students aren't happy with her, which she denied.\n\nNow I wonder if my comments went too far against her, despite her poor teaching.", "created_utc": 1690955294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g09bz/aita_for_telling_a_class_that_their_previous/", "score": 385, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's concerning how badly her students performed under her instruction, but you shouldn't bad mouth her to them.", "In a professional environment YTA. I\u2019ve been there. You should have let things go through disciplinary channels and not drop informal comments like that in the workplace. \nYour frustration is understandable, but you could tell she\u2019s buddies with the kids and nothing will be kept from her. \nHope the school doesn\u2019t make you the bad guy. \n\nAnother alternative was to have sat her down and tried to mentor her to up her standards.

This is an adult matter and should be between faculty.", "Honestly shocked by all the Y T As here. Everyone in here talking about how you were unprofessional by talking to the kid like that but personally I don\u2019t think so. The new teacher was being super unprofessional and rude by undermining you throughout the year. It\u2019s not even like you did nothing to stop it either since you told her to manage her class better, but again she didn\u2019t listen. You cannot just micromanage and hover over everything she does because you have your own things to do as well.

Not sure I\u2019d call you an asshole, but I would have kept those comments to myself.", "YTA. \n\nWhy would you even broach that topic with the students?  How do you think it will affect their relationship to education? You just essentially told them the private education their parents pay for is subpar. At you best you deprived them of accountability and at worst you demoralized them and might cause them to lose faith in educational institutions. You were unprofessional and there was no need to try to demean her to the students. Also you hired and supervised her so how does it reflect on you?\n\nHer subpar results should have been a moment to reflect on a growth path for her. I would expect she has a mentor who is providing her with frequent constructive feedback (manage your time better is too vague but this is a reddit post I assume you were just summarizing). As a new teacher she needs lots of guidance and clear outcomes outlined to her. Maybe that was done. That doesn't excuse her actions or her results. Speaking directly with her and with your administrators is the correct outlet for your frustrations, not a snide remark to students.", "YTA. You were unprofessional. The fact that the other teacher is also unprofessional doesn't mean you can or should be too. Quite the opposite, in fact - it makes it even more important that you're completely professional. You failed.", "ESH", "Gently YTA. \n\nIt was unprofessional and inappropriate. It was also probably unnecessary - the students are not idiots, they would have been very aware of her incompetence and already drawn their own conclusions. You didn't need to spell it out.", "YTA.

There's a lot of educational apps/platforms such as Blackboard, Class Dojo, Canvas, etc., aimed at  providing virtual education forums that are used for a myriad of reasons (homework assignments are the most obvious case use). All of these services offer some type of functionality to communicate with your teacher if you have questions and the like. Also schools usually publish teacher's contact details (email) to help facilitate teacher-parent communication.\n\nThe fact OP' comment got back to the new teacher in 2023 is not surprising at all and OP should have been aware this was very possible.\n\nEdit/P.S.: Anyways, good point but that's not necessarily a red flag in 2023.

This should have been monitored and resolved throughout the year, rather than letting the kids down - that's where you might be TA.\nBut she is definitely an even bigger AH. As someone who has suffered at the hands of an incompetent GCSE maths teacher (UK 14-16), made to feel stupid because she couldn't control the class and then would just sit there refusing to teach, then had to pay for private tuition before I achieved good grades, this woman is a massive AH, and the kids deserve to know its her, not them. Combined with her casual disrespect towards other staff members in front of students she needs to be fired.\nAnd explain to those kids summer school is not a punishment its to help them achieve their potential. Because at that age I would have seen it as a punishment or 'stupid camp'", "Yes. You've handled this terribly.

Why were you not doing your job as a principal of the school? I\u2019d be asking you why you failed in your responsibilities", "ESH.

According to your own post you were aware from an early stage that her class wasn't on time with the coursebook and you still didn't do anything. No, reminding the teacher about time management it's not doing anything, sitting with the teacher to see where they are and how she can recover the lost time is the least you should have done.\n\nYou hired a new teacher without experience and you did cero follow up and training apparently. That class is in summer school not only for their teacher's incompetemce, but also because of your own.", "YTA. Not for the comment but for not taking action to avoid innocent students paying the price for a teacher's incompetence. You knew that her students were falling behind and did nothing to address it.", "YTA, you know there's problem with her teaching but you let a whole class fail. As a head it's your responsibility to make sure the students get proper education. \n\nIt's not the students fault that they failed, it's yours.", "YTA.\n\nYou had all of these examples, and observations, of her not doing her job, and you, the head of the department, did nothing.\n\n**You** failed these students.  Respondeat superior definitely applies here.  And given that it's a private school, and you shirked your duties as a department head, there's probably a cause of action here.\n\nAnd then you tried to blame her for it, to the students, which, yes, is, in fact, unprofessional.  The professional response would have been things like training, performance improvement plans, and if that failed, going through the disciplinary process.\n\nKinda makes me wonder if you were setting her up for failure or humiliation.  And I wonder why.  Ageism?  Sexism?  She turned down an advance?", "Honestly we in our school back then had our own WhatsApp groups with teachers and what not.\nAll in all chill time.\nBut also might just be the laid back village area thematic going on", "Agreed. I bet the students know how bad their teacher is. No need to sugarcoat it. Though OP definitely should have done something way before summer school.", "ESH,\nYou were pretty neutral until you made that comment to the student. I taught for 7 years and was the head teacher my last two. As much as I didn\u2019t like or agree with teachers, even if they were incompetent, I never let students know that. You are free to think that and deal with it on a professional level, but the students don\u2019t need to hear that. \n\nAlso, the need to a master\u2019s level adult to want the approval of teenagers is a bit concerning.  I worked with preschool and elementary age students and over my time had teachers like that too. Idk if they just really want to be liked and seen as cool or trying to make up for a lack of popularity at a different stage, but it has some weird vibes to it. \n\nThat teacher needs to be escalated to someone beyond you, which I\u2019m hoping you did already. 54% pass rate and the slow pace of the book are telling along with students admitting they have chatting and free time. Kids need balance to learn properly but too much either way (too strict or not enough structure) and you have, well exactly what happened. Maybe it\u2019s inexperience (does she have teaching license/degree?), professionalism, or maybe you need to look at replacing her, for the sake of the students.", "The fact you didn't convey the message to her is the first thing you fucked up on. The second is telling it to the students.", "NTA.  Unprofessional but given that she has failed the students (and I do think that's a much bigger issue than articulating what you did) I can't really hold that against you.\n\n  I'm more curious, though, what's happening with her now and going forward.", "NTA teachers that try to be friends with their students are the worst (and may have ulterior motives). OTOH, why didn't you fire the teacher the moment you knew she was not upholding discipline and undermining your authority?", "NTA doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s actually interested in teaching why is she still employed at the school?", "NTA I was failed by so many teachers but because students are children no one listens to them when they have concerns about their curriculum. Our elementary school French teacher was exactly the same, our entire class failed. Thanks for standing up for education.", "NTA.  \n\nShe was there to teach the students, not befriend them.  She was so fixated on being the \"cool teacher\" that her students didn't actually learn anything.", "YTA. Saying that to a student is horrendously unprofessional. There is a process to be followed in this situation. Follow it. Otherwise she can claim correct procedure was not followed by you and retain her job/move elsewhere with no problems at all.", "YTA if only because you said this about a colleague to a STUDENT. I would never talk badly about a teacher to a student. Another colleague who I trust? Possibly. But to a student? That is absolutely crossing a line.\n\nAs another commenter pointed out, you are the head of the department and you could have also reached out to the head of the school if you had serious misgivings about what was happening in her classroom. To place all of the blame on her is a bit atrocious when it seems there were a lot of missed signals all over the place.", "I mean, in general you sound like an asshole and she sounds insufferable. \n\nYou suck. \n\nShe sucks. \n\nSeems like this school is incapable or correctly assessing or educating its students reliably if the only time this is seen is at end of the year tests. \n\nAll and all the only people in this situation who are not assholes are these students who have to deal with suck immature adults who can\u2019t seem to work or communicate effectively. \n\nESH", "ESH why are you shit talking her to the students rather than bringing to administration that she's incompetent and possibly a danger to the students? \n\nWhy wasn't anything done when she wasn't getting through the curriculum? You mentioned classroom management to her? Wtf kind of school just lets a brand new teacher completely fail her students and do absolutely nothing until it's too late? \n\nShe's not the only one who dropped the ball and failed these students. After reading your comments it's clear that you didn't do anything because it would have been more work for you.", "ESH if she\u2019s that bad go through procedures to get rid of her, don\u2019t bad mouth her to the kids.", "YTA  \n\n\nBecause it's actually your responsability as head of the mathematic department that put her here. Managers are responsible for a team's failure. She wans't giving her class any math lesson for a full year and you ignored it.", "ESH. Not sure if that comment Was necessary, but i get it, you were fed up. However, she clearly needs to be terminated from her job, maybe grow up a bit before going back to teaching.

In fact, I\u2019m wondering why she\u2019s still at the school.", "Yes, YTA.  As educators, part of your job is to provide a united front to the students. Making a snide remark about a fellow teacher is immature and should be beneath you. Her inability to do her job well doesn't give you the right to mock her in public. That being said, your administration needs to look into her teaching practices. I don't see her career ending well.", "Yes YTA.", "Both wrong in this situation. \n\nNew Teacher needs to learn the boundary with students and not cross that. Especially making remarks about teachers, although I question the source of this info. If its coming from students, you are just as bad if not worse. \n\nYou, the old head and dept chair need to support and not set new teachers up for failure. This behavior is what is turning you students away from wanting to become teachers", "Who the hell mentored or observed this teacher weekly and checked her lesson plans and quizzes and grade book? Who shared ideas and plans? Who followed up and coached her on parent communications? Who sat with her at departmental meetings to check standards and progress? Or did you just shit talk her?\nShe didn\u2019t fail alone. \nSigned, A Teacher", "Esh cuz you're involving the students in your comment which is also just as unprofessional as her. \n\nHow can you get rid of the teacher?

I was assuming she had been fired, but it sounds from your post like she still works with you??? If she'd had to leave due to her incompetence and it was an open secret YWBTAH due to being unprofessional, but it would be understandable what with frustrations. If she still works with you, this is undermining her authority AND yours - and kids hone in on that shit (source: went through 7 history teachers one year in HS and also spent 8 years working in inner-city schools)\n\nY also TA for the way you talk about her: I understand that you think you're cutting her some slack by mentioning how she's fresh out of college, but honestly that has no bearing on her skills. The worst teacher I ever had was a 55 year old veteran who was great at teaching 6th form but could NOT control a class, and my best friend got promoted to head of department after 3 years teaching because of the work she put in and her competence level. I've also seen people with incredibly different styles and classroom manners be successful - black teachers who related to children differently to my white ass and I would never imitate but respect nonetheless, people who are caring, people who are hardass, people who are incredibly honest and demand respect from the kids in return. There is no one way to teach, and you don't necessarily know better because you don't share a style or have been in the game longer (though, naturally, I do assume that I have something to learn from more experienced practitioners until proven otherwise)\n\nIt sounds like you're reasonably concerned about her skills. Y STILL TA. Every workplace has a procedure for this, and in schools it's extra important to not disrupt learning, sow seeds of doubt, undermine other staff members etc. You need to feed back to your seniors about this, share the statistics of how many of her wards are in remedial lessons and what you have seen of her conduct. Do this alone as others will let you down (my mum is a lifelong teacher and has been union rep in several schools - trust me on this one, other people can't be bothered with the hassle and the politics). \n\nIt's happened to me a couple of times: I was a librarian, so when English teachers cracked under the pressure I've had to take classes for a term or so whilst they find a replacement. It's demoralising teaching kids something they should know already, whether they come into year 7 unable to read and there's no space in the curriculum now for them to learn so you're grabbing space, or you're faced with a media studies class with no portfolio by year 11. You NEVER insult the previous teacher or their negligent parents!! Tbh I wouldn't even do it in the staffroom or the pub because there will always be consequences.

You have just given the students reason to disrespect her and anyone they believe is like her.

This is a discussion to be had with the teacher. If she continues to be disrespectful,  it might be reasonable to chastise her, but IMO she probably needed more supervision and support in her first job. It sucks that teacher success is measured by student grades because it is such a delayed and inaccurate way of measuring how a teacher is doing. \n\nI think that OP is in a situation where he already has an ungodly amount of work, and being the department head just adds additional workload. Providing the amount of oversight and support by himself that this teacher needed was probably not an option. Intervention sooner would have been the most responsible course of action, and OP would likely have to get the other teachers in the department involved. \n\nBlaming all of this on the teacher who screwed up is bad leadership, and it would probably be better to apologize to the students for not recognizing that there was a problem and remind them that if they need help they can reach out to other teachers or their school counselor.

My district actually prohibits me from grading homework, because we can't guarantee they can access a pseudo-academic environment at home.
