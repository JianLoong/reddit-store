She made the decision to leave a baby not even a fortnight old alone for nearly six hours so she could do a spa day and rationalised it as being all good because babies sleep all the time.

If she was overwhelmed, she needed to ask for help, not abandon her child alone. Honestly, the fact that she went out for 5 hours and didn't understand what she did wrong would indicate that she doesn't have the moral fiber to be a parent.\n\nI wouldn't let her mother sway you either - if she doesn't understand why her daughter shouldn't be taking care of a baby, then you don't need to be listening to her.", "NTA", "This was not a small mistake.

That isn't a small mistake. But, that said, she is still your baby's mother. So it would be good to be on amicable terms with supervised visits for the emotional wellbeing of your child. You're a good father for defending your little girl. No one in their right mind would tell you that you're wrong for that.\n\nIt's likely she's experiencing post partum depression, so don't write her off entirely just yet unless this is in line with her usual behavior. If she's normally responsible, she may genuinely need your help to get help right now.", "NTA your baby could\u2019ve died and she would be in prison.

What she did isn\u2019t a \u201csmall mistake\u201d it\u2019s actually horrifying. \n\nShe also may be suffering from PPA or PPD so it\u2019s best to let professionals handle this situation.", "NTA and absolutely absolutely absolutely not.  It's inexcusable.  You're doing the right thing to protect your baby.", "NTA. If she was having a mental health crisis, then that needs to be addressed.

This is something that could result in criminal charges! See I fully understand I would not be a fit parent, therefor I never became one. Nor did I ever have to terminate a pregnancy.

BUT - makes you wonder where she learned this negligent behaviour from!", "NTA you need to get 100 percent custody and go no contact with her", "NTA. This was not a \u201csmall mistake.\u201d This was straight up neglect. When I had my daughter my \u201csmall mistakes\u201d were not burping her long enough, changing her diaper when I thought she was done pooping only to get pooped on mid change, not moving up a diaper size soon enough resulting in way too many blow outs, getting stuck in traffic and not being able to feed her soon enough making her cranky. All parenting has a learning curve. Leaving a baby unattended for 5+ hours is UNACCEPTABLE. I would have gone nuclear too. Keep your distance. This might be PPD but that doesn\u2019t mean you should give in. She doesn\u2019t get visitation until she\u2019s done the work to get better. \n\nPPD is serious and I know a ton of moms struggle with the challenges of being a new mom, but this is extreme, and your reaction needs to be equally as extreme until you know she\u2019s ok.", "NTA.

Being a new mom is hard and overwhelming and I'm sure she's not at her best but abandoning an infant is absolutely not ok.

Do NOT trust her again. She knew better, a ten year old knows not to leave a baby by themselves. The kiddos they just get harder as they grow up.

If she's capable of leaving an 11 day old baby home alone, who the hell knows what else she will do. She needs help and keep her away from the baby.

Something much worse could\u2019ve happened, and I\u2019m glad nothing did", "NTA but this isn't going to go the way you think if you keep denying access. CPS is involved, which overrides family court and CPS is not going to go with \"she can never see her child again.\" They will give her supervised and eventually unsupervised visits and possibly even 50/50 after her parenting classes. Reunification is the goal, not keeping the child completely away from a parent. \n\nYou would probably fair better in court and have a better chance of getting supervised for a longer period of time if you allowed supervised visits without needing the court to force you. Then you have established supervised for now.", "NTA for now.  What happened is a safety issue and you're 100% right to ensure she is not alone with the baby until she can be safely alone with the baby.  I get that you're angry and fear for your own temper, but at some point, your ex should still get to see your daughter, even if in the presence of a qualified supervisor.  She is her daughter too.", "NTA.  Seems like your ex is not even trying tk get custody.  This is probably for the best", "NTA.\n\nAt a minimum, she needs to go through those parenting classes and be medically assessed to see if there are issues like PPD going on that need to be addressed, and unless ordered by the court or your attorney advises you to act differently, it seems reasonable to refuse any visitation until those have been completed.", "NTA hopefully parenting classes will help or if she actually has some severe form of post partum depression she will get help. I can certainly understand you not wanting to be around her. Your reaction is normal. Unfortunately I do think you need to give some access to the baby. A court will make you anyway. Unless you are afraid she is going to take the baby away if given access, I suggest asking someone you trust to supervise the visit. Definitely document every little interaction.  Good luck.", "Omg, you know what can happen to an infant in that amount of time! A lot! The baby could have rolled over, suffocated, fell down, so many things! The hunger thing alone!

Do you have someone (one of your parents?) nearby who you would trust to supervise, either with you, or in your place?  Is there a someone within the court system who can mediate this?  If not, get yourself to be civil.  You can do it.", "NTA. That's never okay.", "What the fuck? You daughter could have died!  You are absolutely right. \n\nIf she wants to visit, there are usually supervised visitation centers you can go to, where a social worker is present.", "NTA. That was irresponsible & I can see why you don\u2019t trust her near your kid but please get legal backup. Courts are huge on having both parents in the kid\u2019s life & accuse parents of parental alienation a lot when they are trying to keep their kid\u2019s safe.

When you have kids and you're not around them, you make sure you can be reached unless it's absolutely impossible.", "Wtf is up with that mom? Why didn\u2019t she babysit if she knows so much??\n\nOnce OP (hopefully) gets custody, he needs to unass himself from all these dangerous nuts.", "Yes make sure her mother is not the supervisor. I have a friends ex MIL would be the supervisor and wasn\u2019t supposed to allow the ex near the kids if he had been drinking. Turns out she had been letting him not only with the kids unsupervised while claiming she was there, but she put the kids in a car with him driving knowing he was drunk. He got in an accident, kids were ok, and it all came out. It was a nightmare.", "If you don't have one then get a doorbell camera to record her or her mother trying to convince you in person to go easy on her.", "Make sure you keep pictures, doc visit summaries etc to prove your case in court. I think this sub is rooting for you 100%", "You\u2019re a good dad.", "Truthfully this doesn't sound like PPA or PPD. This isn't a woman who's depressed. This is a woman who wanted to go out and have a good time with her friends", "Right? This was a deliberate choice. She didn\u2019t express any remorse when OP called her out, she acted totally justified. I\u2019d love to know what she told the friend. Did she lie and say she had a babysitter, or did she straight up admit to abandoning her baby?\n\nThis was a serious act of child abuse.", "Realistically she will be given the chance by a judge. If she wants it.", "Yeah leaving an 11 day old baby alone for 6 hours is reckless endangerment and child abuse. \nKid could very well have died.", "Oh. It says 5 weeks in the beginning. He found out about his uncle\u2019s death when she was 11 days old. I could have misinterpreted it.", "And records of trying to reach her on that day, the call history.", "She's acting like a 20yo who hasn't had a baby less than a fortnight ago. If she wants any custody of their daughter she needs to accept the free spirit she's acting like isn't who she is.", "Maybe, but once this gets to court she will be evaluated because leaving an infant at home for hours and not telling anyone is a red flag for mental instability", "Maybe, that's really bad though, I'm not sure a judge would be comfortable letting the child alone with her. If anything she might be able to get supervised visitation for quite some time.", "I\u2019m sure she will but I hope she has a shred of self-awareness and can admit that she doesn\u2019t actually want to be a parent.", "I know someone that broke their kids legs an infant. All they had to do was take parenting classes to get their kids back. Is it right nope but our system is messed up."]}
