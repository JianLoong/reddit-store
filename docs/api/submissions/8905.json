We stayed together and five weeks ago our daughter was born. She was so precious and it was instant love I felt for her. \n\nI took paternity leave and things were going good until my uncle passed away when our daughter was a few old. The funeral was three hours away. We talked about it and agreed that I would go, stay for the funeral, and then drive back. So I did this. For reference baby girl was eleven days old. \n\nWhen I got back her car was gone. I head inside and hear baby girl crying. I walked into the nursery and found my daughter with a soaking wet (I\u2019m talking entire outfit was soaked including through her swaddle blanket), poopy diaper, huge diaper rash.  \n\nI got her right into a bath to get her cleaned up, took pictures of the rash to show the doc because my mom has told me that I\u2019d have this mystery rash that would clear up right before a doc visit, and then made her a bottle. She typically has 4oz of formula. She had six before sleeping again. \n\nI then tried calling my now ex. When she didn\u2019t answer after four tries I started calling her friends. Finally one of them answered. They had just gotten out of a spa!!! She had spent five fing hours at the spa (that is a forty minute drive in good traffic from our place) getting who knows what done (I was seeing red and didn\u2019t care, still dont). Friend handed the phone over to gf and I asked/yelled why she left our daughter home alone. She said that she didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal because all she does is sleep anyway. \n\nI told her to come and get her stuff. All of it would be on the porch and that I didn\u2019t want to see her again. She tried to call me again and ring the doorbell but I didn\u2019t answer. \n\nA report was made and she\u2019s being made to take parenting classes after she claimed to be overwhelmed. I am working with a child support/custody lawyer but that date isn\u2019t till next month. \n\nToday her mom called me and said I needed to forgive her because every new mom makes small mistakes and it\u2019s ok because she turned out alright. That I\u2019m an ass because I\u2019m keeping a newborn baby from her mom. I told her that there was no way I was going to let her have access to her again.

To answer some questions I do have an emergency temp custody order. She was charged and arrested but got out on bail. I will be talking to my lawyer about this tomorrow.

She made the decision to leave a baby not even a fortnight old alone for nearly six hours so she could do a spa day and rationalised it as being all good because babies sleep all the time.

Buckle up my dude, your life just got real.", "NTA but do nothing without discussing with your lawyer.  You don't want to make a decision that would negatively impact your custody rights.  (And that could include refusing to let her see the baby.)", "NTA. This was not a small mistake: this was a conscious and deliberate choice. Leaving an infant alone for 5 hours is unconscionable. If she was overwhelmed, she needed to ask for help, not abandon her child alone. Honestly, the fact that she went out for 5 hours and didn't understand what she did wrong would indicate that she doesn't have the moral fiber to be a parent.\n\nI wouldn't let her mother sway you either - if she doesn't understand why her daughter shouldn't be taking care of a baby, then you don't need to be listening to her.", "NTA", "This was not a small mistake.

That isn't a small mistake. But, that said, she is still your baby's mother. So it would be good to be on amicable terms with supervised visits for the emotional wellbeing of your child. You're a good father for defending your little girl. No one in their right mind would tell you that you're wrong for that.\n\nIt's likely she's experiencing post partum depression, so don't write her off entirely just yet unless this is in line with her usual behavior.

This is something that could result in criminal charges! See I fully understand I would not be a fit parent, therefor I never became one. Nor did I ever have to terminate a pregnancy.

BUT - makes you wonder where she learned this negligent behaviour from!", "NTA you need to get 100 percent custody and go no contact with her", "NTA. This was not a \u201csmall mistake.\u201d This was straight up neglect. When I had my daughter my \u201csmall mistakes\u201d were not burping her long enough, changing her diaper when I thought she was done pooping only to get pooped on mid change, not moving up a diaper size soon enough resulting in way too many blow outs, getting stuck in traffic and not being able to feed her soon enough making her cranky. All parenting has a learning curve. Leaving a baby unattended for 5+ hours is UNACCEPTABLE. I would have gone nuclear too. Keep your distance. This might be PPD but that doesn\u2019t mean you should give in. She doesn\u2019t get visitation until she\u2019s done the work to get better. \n\nPPD is serious and I know a ton of moms struggle with the challenges of being a new mom, but this is extreme, and your reaction needs to be equally as extreme until you know she\u2019s ok.", "NTA.

Being a new mom is hard and overwhelming and I'm sure she's not at her best but abandoning an infant is absolutely not ok.

Do NOT trust her again. She knew better, a ten year old knows not to leave a baby by themselves. The kiddos they just get harder as they grow up.

Something much worse could\u2019ve happened, and I\u2019m glad nothing did", "NTA but this isn't going to go the way you think if you keep denying access. CPS is involved, which overrides family court and CPS is not going to go with \"she can never see her child again.\" They will give her supervised and eventually unsupervised visits and possibly even 50/50 after her parenting classes. Reunification is the goal, not keeping the child completely away from a parent. \n\nYou would probably fair better in court and have a better chance of getting supervised for a longer period of time if you allowed supervised visits without needing the court to force you. Then you have established supervised for now.", "NTA for now.  What happened is a safety issue and you're 100% right to ensure she is not alone with the baby until she can be safely alone with the baby.  I get that you're angry and fear for your own temper, but at some point, your ex should still get to see your daughter, even if in the presence of a qualified supervisor.  She is her daughter too.", "NTA.  Seems like your ex is not even trying tk get custody.  This is probably for the best", "NTA.\n\nAt a minimum, she needs to go through those parenting classes and be medically assessed to see if there are issues like PPD going on that need to be addressed, and unless ordered by the court or your attorney advises you to act differently, it seems reasonable to refuse any visitation until those have been completed.", "NTA hopefully parenting classes will help or if she actually has some severe form of post partum depression she will get help. I can certainly understand you not wanting to be around her. Your reaction is normal. Unfortunately I do think you need to give some access to the baby. A court will make you anyway. Unless you are afraid she is going to take the baby away if given access, I suggest asking someone you trust to supervise the visit. Definitely document every little interaction.  Good luck.", "Omg, you know what can happen to an infant in that amount of time! A lot! The baby could have rolled over, suffocated, fell down, so many things! The hunger thing alone!

Do you have someone (one of your parents?) nearby who you would trust to supervise, either with you, or in your place?  Is there a someone within the court system who can mediate this?  If not, get yourself to be civil.  You can do it.", "NTA. That's never okay.", "What the fuck? You daughter could have died!  You are absolutely right. \n\nIf she wants to visit, there are usually supervised visitation centers you can go to, where a social worker is present.", "NTA. That was irresponsible & I can see why you don\u2019t trust her near your kid but please get legal backup. Courts are huge on having both parents in the kid\u2019s life & accuse parents of parental alienation a lot when they are trying to keep their kid\u2019s safe.
