{"id": 19085, "submission_id": "141usa6", "title": "AITA for trying to prevent my wife from going on a tropical Christmas vacation without me?", "selftext": "My (31m) wife\u2019s (29f) father unexpectedly and tragically died back in 2020. He was deeply loved by his family and friends and hundreds of people mourned his loss.\n\nHis absolute favorite holiday was Christmas. He was responsible for bringing the \u201cChristmas Spirit\u201d to the family each year. Because of this, his absence has been painfully noticeable during the past 3 Christmases and has caused my wife\u2019s family extreme mental anguish. Therefore, my in-laws recently decided they would leave their cold home during Christmas of 2023 and spend a week in the Caribbean to forget their troubles.\n\nMy in-laws really like my company and I have spent the past 7 Christmases with them. I have been invited to join them on this trip but I am a Firefighter/EMT and it is impossible for me to leave my job for 8 days during Christmas. It will likely always be impossible for me to do such a big trip during the holidays until I retire. My in-laws understand and are saddened that I can\u2019t get off work but have decided to still go on vacation without me.\n\nI believe the vacation is a bad idea. It seems as though they're running away from their grief instead of dealing with it in a healthy way (such as therapy, which so far all have refused to participate in). I fear they'll still all be miserable and sad on Christmas, but with a change of scenery.\n\nI originally tried to be understanding of this trip but a very close friend (31f) of mine said that her leaving me behind was \u201cfucked up\u201d which caused me to think a lot more about it. After a few weeks, I finally told my wife that although I knew she was trying to help her mother escape her sorrows, I felt somewhat abandoned and angry since she knew I would never be able to join her on this trip in the first place. I also told her that I felt that this trip was completely in vain and would not achieve any desired results. I asked if there could be a compromise or if the Caribbean really was the only way to cure this sadness.\n\nI was told that that I should be more supportive, that this trip is just a \u201cone-time thing,\u201d and that there was no alternative solution to the problem. I said that I didn\u2019t like that answer but was told that this was \u201cjust the way things are\u201d and there\u2019s nothing more that can be done. I should point out that I can (and likely will) spend Christmas with a very close friend and my father\u2019s family who all live nearby, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be left entirely alone for the holidays. However, it\u2019s still a bummer to be left behind by my wife on Christmas for a non-urgent reason.\n\nI also worry that this could turn into a tradition and that my wife might choose to leave the country each year, leaving me behind every Christmas for the next 25 years until I retire. I don\u2019t feel like I have any way to fix this problem and I have no way to fight it except to say \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d I also feel like a real asshole for trying to stop to my wife from trying to take care of her family\u2019s 3+ years of emotional trauma. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I should point out that my wife regularly goes on vacations with her family without me about two or three times a year. I'm accustomed to that and am not jealous of her trips. This is not a jealousy issue, it's more about wanting to be with my wife on Christmas and feeling frustrated at her family for not addressing their grief for a death that occurred 3+ years ago and instead leaving the country on holiday.", "created_utc": 1686005189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141usa6/aita_for_trying_to_prevent_my_wife_from_going_on/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should be happy your wife can celebrate her father with the trip this year. If it starts to become a yearly thing, you can cross that bridge when you come to it", "YTA. This isn't about OP.  This isn't something wife and family are doing TO OP as a way of punishing or disrespecting them. They're trying out a fun vacation and change of scenery to attempt to lighten up what has become a dark time of year.  \n\nOP, don't be a Grinch because your work situation doesn't allow you to join in the fun on this particular trip. It is a HUGE leap to assume at this point it will become a yearly tradition.  In the event it does continue and wife continues to leave knowing how you feel and without taking similar time to vacation with you this becomes a different story.  If (big IF) that comes to pass, the ruling changes.\n\nAdditional AH points to the friend making comments to set off OP.

Research directs grieving people to create different experience(s) during a particular holiday/month/event strongly connected to the deceased (it's a grief spike). YES, they still will be sad. They don't have to go to therapy to appease you. Life is a journey and you don't get the big picture. Your job eliminates your participation so embrace this reality instead of accusing others of 'not' doing 'x' to get over grief.", "YTA. It really sucks to be left for Christmas butttt \n1. You chose a career that would make this kind of travel difficult, and on the flip side, does your wife just have to wait until you retire to go on trips at Christmas?\n2. Your \u201cclose female friend\u201d is stirring up drama and you\u2019re eating it up. You need to put a stop to that immediately or you might never spend a holiday with your wife again. \n3. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in the US, if not, disregard. But it sounds like you could go on a portion of this trip even if you can\u2019t take the full amount of time off, and it seems odd that you haven\u2019t looked into how to make this something that works for both of you. \n4. You don\u2019t get to police anyone\u2019s grief. It\u2019s not like this family or your wife sounds like they\u2019re not functioning, they\u2019re just struggling with a time of year that was important to their loved one.", "YTA  \nRemove head from ass.  \nLet wife be with her dear ones.", "YTA. It's not up to you how they process grief. Stop trying to hide behind excuses and just admit you're upset that you're being left out.", "YTA. You've given a handful of excuses for your position (why not therapy? what if this becomes a pattern?) but they're flimsy fig leafs over very obvious jealousy. You can't go, and so you don't want your wife to go. If you have to miss out on one of the great pleasures of life, then your wife must also miss out. Super shitty attitude.", "YTA. Your wife\u2019s dad died and the family is trying to do something nice to honor their grief. Your work schedule is not more important than your wife & her family\u2019s healing process.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for feeling left out but what\u2019s with the mental gymnastics about this trip being \u201ca bad idea\u201d? What\u2019s \u201cthe problem at hand\u201d the trip won\u2019t solve, that they\u2019re sad and miss their dead loved one? Because going on a vacation and seeing novel scenery is actually a great way to get out of your own head and enjoy your life when you\u2019ve been dealing with grief", "Sorry but YTA.  You don\u2019t get to tell someone how to grieve.  You were offered the opportunity to go with them and you declined - yes, you had your reasons, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have to put their plans to the side simply because you can\u2019t attend.  \n\n\nTo add to that, you\u2019re basically making it sound like you\u2019d be fine with them going if you were able to go with them - that just further supports the idea that you\u2019re being selfish and that it\u2019s not about encouraging \u201chealthy grieving\u201d (which, again, is neither your job nor your place to judge) but rather about keeping your wife from having fun without you.   Do I understand why you don\u2019t want to spend the holidays alone?  Certainly.  But is your reasoning justified?  Nope.", "YTA.\n\nThe family is grieving, and doing what feels right to them to cope with their grief. It's one Christmas of your life (if it becomes a yearly thing, you can deal with it as it happens.)  They've suffered a tremendous loss and are doing what they can to manage it, and it would be really great if you could support her in that.", "YTA.\n\nThe departed was \"Mr. Christmas\" to his family (my ILs had one, too, RIP Aunt K!) You're projecting that this will become an annual event. Let your wife's family mourn *AND* celebrate. If it becomes a tradition, it will move to accommodate individuals' preferences. Good Lord, man, who doesn't want to escape North American winter in January!", "YTA.  There is a lot of me me me in your discussion and I can't really see where you are a victim here.  Your female friend is not giving you good advice.", "YTA\n\nYou're making this about you. You don't get to decide how people grieve.", "YTA if this is, indeed, a one time thing. It sounds like they all could use a respite and a chance to make new positive memories. Do you think she should have to spend the rest of your marriage knowing you fought that?", "Sorry buddy.  You are most definitely the asshole.  Go back and review what you wrote and stop right before you get to the part where your \u201cclose female friend\u201d gets into your head.  THAT\u2019S actually the fucked up part!  The fact that you were so easily influenced by friend\u2019s comment.  Up until that point you sounded like you were grieving a bit too.  But then you flipped a switch and made it about you.  You can\u2019t  dictate how people grieve.   And sometimes yeah- you need a complete change of pace - something COMPLETELY new and unknown.  Why would you begrudge your wife this chance to start healing?   \n\nAnd stop playing the what if game \u201cwhat if she does this every year???\u201dSeriously???   (And i do mean SERIOUSLY- you REALLY think that 25 years can pass and you\u2019re job stays the same, your constraints are the same, her grief stays the same?  Of course you don\u2019t think that - so just stop.  You\u2019re reaching and it shows.    All of that aside, thank you for being a firefighter.", "YTA. Stop making this all about you. This is about your wife and her family working through grief. I\u2019m a bit confused about this being \u201cthe in-laws\u201d trip if her dad died, but that\u2019s pretty much irrelevant. You should support her opportunity here and see if there is any way you could join for 3-5 days if you can\u2019t do the entire trip.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not for you to tell anyone else how to process their grief. They want to try this Caribbean trip, to see if it helps. Maybe it will. Maybe it won't. Let them at least try.\n\nIf it does help them, great.\n\nIf (as you fear) it starts a new family tradition that they are eager to continue for future Christmases, and you are sad that you will be left out for the next 25 years, that is a conversation you can have with your wife next year, and see if you can work out some kind of compromise, e.g. she goes to the Caribbean every second or third year.\n\nBut you are getting waaaay ahead of yourself. They haven't even had the first one yet. They may not even like it, and decide not to do it again.\n\nAlso, firefighter or not, why are you chained to your home every Christmas for the next 25 years? Doesn't your employer EVER let you take extended leave at Christmas time?\n\nI work in an industry where we need a full roster of staff, 24/7/365, so Christmas is like any other day. BUT we don't insist that *every* employee is available to work *every* Christmas holiday period. We take in turns. If I worked some days over Christmas this year, I get to take my 8-day break (or longer) next Christmas. It's only fair.\n\nYour friend should mind her own business.", "YTA because you let another person outside if the family influence your stupid demand.

What is wrong with you?", ">I should point out that I can (and likely will) spend Christmas with a very close friend\n\n**INFO:** Is this the same \u201cvery close friend\u201d who helped stoke the conflict between you and your wife by picking away at your acceptance with \u201cthat\u2019s fucked up?\u201d", "Yta\n\nOh hell no, you just sound salty because you don't get to go on a holiday and now you try to guilt trip your wife into staying. Grow up.", "YTA you don't get to tell other people the best way for them to grieve. There wasn't a problem until you let your crappy friend get in your head and remind you that the world is supposed to revolve around you.", "YTA. You are not a grief counsellor. You don\u2019t get to determine if this trip is helpful to them or not.", "YTA. Personally, I think the trip is a great idea. \n\nAs someone who worked in retail for years, I\u2019ve had to miss many holiday activities. It sucked. But I never got upset at my family for me having to miss out.", "YTA - This seems like a perfectly valid way to grieve. Christmas without your FIL sucks so the family is going to change things up to make the painful holiday more bearable. This is like totally normal behavior. This isn't about you, and it is not fucked up that she is going to spend Christmas with her widowed mother instead of with you who has a job that can't take regular holidays. Your wife can celebrate Christmas with you at home on a different day when she returns.", "Did you think it was a bad idea before your gal pal said it was fucked up? Does this particular friend dislike your wife by any chance ?", "Mild YTA.\n\nSource: Am a first responder spouse.\n\nThat's the job. You knew when you took it that you'd miss out. My spouse never holds me back when plans conflict with duty schedule, and I do my part by trying to plan around the duty schedule, but shit happens and sometimes I go to family functions on my own with our kiddos. \n\nIf you're that concerned about their grieving process, why not try to bring more of the spirit of Christmas next year?? Plan a holiday cookie exchange, host a gingerbread house decorating contest, go crazy with the decor, etc. Don't try to take his place but honor his memory and try to move the focus towards remembering fondly vs wallowing in sadness.", "YTA. For one reason, and one reason only...you don't get to dictate how other people deal with their grief. You NEVER get to do that. Whether you agree with their reasoning or not is irrelevant, this is something that they, as a family, have decided will help them. It's not your place to second guess that, just be respectful and as supportive as you can be and then deal with the aftermath as best you can, and never, ever say \"I told you so\" if it doesn't turn out to be the closure the family are so obviously desperate for. This is one of those moments where pure selflessness is what is required.", "Can\u2019t you possible go for a few days?  Fly in after they get there,fly out before they leave.

How about you tell that female friend of yours to stop trying to break your marriage up with her bullshit, just because she wants to sleep with you, huh?", "YTA\n\nThis is not about you, but you seem to think it is. Go back and re-read your post, how many paragraphs and sentences did you start with \"I\", \"I believe\", \"I felt\". You couldn't even say \"Her family\", you said \"My in-laws\". \n\nHave you thought about what it might do to her if she isn't with her family at this time? How terrible she might feel? It's a shame you can't be with her this year, and it's understandable that you would feel left out - but this career was your choice, so this is a consequence of your choice. I would love an explanation on why you think it's more important for you to not feel left out than it is for your wife to be with her family and manage their grief. \n\nFurthermore, you don't get to dictate how her family grieves. They tried to stick it out at home for several years and it wasn't working. They want to restore happy memories to family holiday so they are trying something different. Can you please explain how thats wrong, or what gives you the right to claim that's inappropriate?", "My dad died a few weeks ago.

YTA.", "INFO:  is the \"very close friend\" with whom you plan to spend Christmas the same person who told you the family trip was \"fucked up\"?", "YTA. This is about you not wanting them to go because you can't go. Everyone handles grief differently. You don't get to dictate how they choose to deal with their grief. They decided as a family that they want to take a trip. So the idea that they should never take a family vacation around Christmas time because of your job is ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nYour wife and family do not need to bow to your schedule. That is only your responsibility, no one else's.\n\nAlso, lose the \"special friend.\"", "YTA - they can deal with their grief however they damn well please.

Everyone deals with grief in different ways. Some people go to therapy, some people shove it down, some like to talk to friends etc. There's no RIGHT way. But acting like you know what would be best for them is the wrong way. I realize it does suck that you won't be spending Xmas with your wife and I think you should have a conversation about making sure you're not left behind every year... BUT, you shouldn't try and prevent them from doing this.", "YTA\n\nA. Different people need different things at different times when dealing with grief, not to mention any other problems that come up in life. It's not necessarily an escape to do what they're doing. The options to limited to nothing or therapy\n\nB. I'm, shall we say, skeptical that you just can't take any extended time off ever. In my experience people making that claim are usually vastly over inflating their own necessity at work. But let's say that is true and you're just never going to have the option to take a vacation until retirement, given your age I'll be ultra-generous and say 25 years. Do you really think it's reasonable to ask your wife to live by that same rule set? Did you tell her this before you got together? That you're never going to have a week off for the rest of your career?", "YTA and your buddy didn't do you any favors. Your wife not being around for Christmas sucks but it's not the end of the world, this is literally a family vacation for her and her family most affected by their father's passing.

Some time in the sun with the family might help them, actually. \nAnd you can definitely be sad that she is going without you (at Christmas or not) once in a while. \nBut!! You can't blame her for wanting to do something with her family during Christmas. It is not her fault you have a job preventing you from going anywhere during the holidays. I understand, believe me. I am a flight attendant with a 4 years old. I am not there at Christmas. My spouse and my daughter can do something fun without me for Christmas while I work.

Don\u2019t cloak it in this post hoc justification that a novel and relaxing family getaway in a sunny, warm climate surrounded by beautiful beaches won\u2019t do anything for the family\u2019s mental health. \n\nIf your wife\u2019s family is finding it difficult to create new happy Christmas memories at home after trying for 3 years, it might really help them get unstuck to be in a radically different environment. Sometimes emotional processes need to be kickstarted with a change in pace. Whatever gets them to see that there can be joy and fun during the holidays after their crushing loss is A Good Thing. \n\nAlso, a lot of people\u2019s moods are affected by dreary winter weather and limited daylight.

As you mentioned, this may not change the grief they feel and they will come to realize that. It sounds like they are struggling as a family to find a new normal.\n\nI would suggest letting your wife know you will miss her, but you understand why they are doing this. Then put it on the back burner until you know if they want this to be an annual trip. At that time you have every right to talk to your wife about how you feel about never sharing Christmas with her and how it will affect your marriage.", "YTA.

I believe that before you can muster the strength to fight, you must convince yourself you have the ability to retreat. The vacation gives the family the ability and permission to self soothe, which is something they desperately need to learn how to do during Christmas. Neither do I think it a bad thing if they try this and fail.\n\nI think you have made your case well and I do think going out of the country to the carribean is a little stereotypical.

It's just a vacation over Christmas. Lots of people travel over the holidays.", "NTA. At first I was going to say YTA but when I read it was 3+ years ago, that changed my thought. They have had a lot of time to grieve and although I\u2019m sure it is still difficult for them, it does not seem fair to leave you out for Christmas if it means that much to you.

He was deeply loved by his family and friends and hundreds of people mourned his loss.\r  \n\r  \nHis absolute favorite holiday was Christmas. He was responsible for bringing the \u201cChristmas Spirit\u201d to the family each year. Because of this, his absence has been painfully noticeable during the past 3 Christmases and has caused my wife\u2019s family extreme mental anguish. Therefore, my in-laws recently decided they would leave their cold home during Christmas of 2023 and spend a week in the Caribbean to forget their troubles.\r  \n\r  \nMy in-laws really like my company and I have spent the past 7 Christmases with them. I have been invited to join them on this trip but I am a Firefighter/EMT and it is impossible for me to leave my job for 8 days during Christmas. It will likely always be impossible for me to do such a big trip during the holidays until I retire. My in-laws understand and are saddened that I can\u2019t get off work but have decided to still go on vacation without me.\r  \n\r  \nI believe the vacation is a bad idea. It seems as though they're running away from their grief instead of dealing with it in a healthy way (such as therapy, which so far all have refused to participate in). I fear they'll still all be miserable and sad on Christmas, but with a change of scenery.\r  \n\r  \nI originally tried to be understanding of this trip but a very close friend (31f) of mine said that her leaving me behind was \u201cfucked up\u201d which caused me to think a lot more about it. After a few weeks, I finally told my wife that although I knew she was trying to help her mother escape her sorrows, I felt somewhat abandoned and angry since she knew I would never be able to join her on this trip in the first place. I also told her that I felt that this trip was completely in vain and would not achieve any desired results. I asked if there could be a compromise or if the Caribbean really was the only way to cure this sadness.\r  \n\r  \nI was told that that I should be more supportive, that this trip is just a \u201cone-time thing,\u201d and that there was no alternative solution to the problem. I said that I didn\u2019t like that answer but was told that this was \u201cjust the way things are\u201d and there\u2019s nothing more that can be done. I should point out that I can (and likely will) spend Christmas with a very close friend and my father\u2019s family who all live nearby, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be left entirely alone for the holidays. However, it\u2019s still a bummer to be left behind by my wife on Christmas for a non-urgent reason.\r  \n\r  \nI also worry that this could turn into a tradition and that my wife might choose to leave the country each year, leaving me behind every Christmas for the next 25 years until I retire. I don\u2019t feel like I have any way to fix this problem and I have no way to fight it except to say \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d I also feel like a real asshole for trying to stop to my wife from trying to take care of her family\u2019s 3+ years of emotional trauma.
