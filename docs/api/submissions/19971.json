Some backstory, my(18F) parents have been divorced for many years, 8 years to be in-fact, but my father(49M) wasn\u2019t in my life until 4 years ago. He paid for my education, while my mom(49F) paid for everything else. However, that changed when he started giving money for her to make my life better and help make bills more payable. He earns lots of money and lives in Dubai. He sends around 1400$ each month. My mom uses this to buy clothes for me and her and pays the bills, she also gets 1400$ from the government as she cannot work. \n\nThe problem is the money I get. As soon as I turned 18, she requested to get full control on my bank account from the government, they granted her wish. So, I get around 400$ from going to school, i pay around 300 to my mom and keep 100. Out of the 100, I pay for the phone bill(both of ours), and pay off some debt of hers and i get left with around 14$ to spend on myself. \n\nWith the 14$, i pay for stuff that makes me happy, example, books and stuff for my pc setup and figurines. By the end of the month, i save a bit of money and by that time, i get next month\u2019s money and already know how much I plan on saving it. \n\n2 days ago, me and my mother had an argument about my money usage, she apparently went through my bank statements and saw the money I used for the month, complaining I\u2019m not using it on anything useful. She starts hurling insults at me for using the money and keeps telling my that my money usage effects her economy. I asked her how, no response. She continues hurling insults at me, and I say \u201cStop looking through my bank statements, the 14$ is the money i get, let me use it how i please.\u201d, She didn\u2019t take too kindly to that. \n\nShe started getting aggressive with me, to the point where i locked myself in my room with the dog. Now, I\u2019m getting calls from my family saying i shouldn\u2019t talk back to my mother and the whole earful. \n\nHow do I get my mother to understand that she has to stop looking at my money usage?\n\nEDIT: If this helps in any case, My mother has anger issues and has gone to therapy for these issues, she\u2019s had them since the divorce, left her broken. \nAs for my bank, they\u2019ve caused me problems before, calling me to ask why there\u2019s no rent payments going from my account and why I keep moving money from the account my dad send\u2019s money on. I might switch soon.\n\nALSO, my mother has been using the bank I use for WAY longer. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she knows a few ppl and the ppl calling me are associated with her. I\u2019m going to switch my account as soon as I get a job, which should be soon. I could ask my father to keep the money he sends ?

Because that sounds like it would be breaking the law.", "Tell the bank it's not up to them, they are to do their job and zip it with the opinions.", "IF they do that, record them, and go to their boss to get them fired.", "I'll lock lock in the OP is lying for $6000", "If you\u2019re 18 then your mum is no longer your legal guardian. Who you live with doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to this. You being in school does tangentially matter since that should mean your mum is responsible to house you, assuming this isn\u2019t university level schooling. But that means your mum has responsibilities *to* you, not that she has rights over you. \n\nSweden, Norway and Denmark all agree that you\u2019re an adult at 18. There are differences between the countries as for if/how you can be deemed not able to have that responsibility for yourself but if you\u2019re 18, studying and able to write to me like this on Reddit then I see nothing that would have caused either government to think you aren\u2019t capable of adulting.  \n\nEven from 16 you have some basic rights with money you earn or that\u2019s been gifted to you. It wouldn\u2019t apply to child support or money for school at that age, but otherwise yeah, your guardian can\u2019t do what they want with your money even at that age.", "No I mean what age do you have to be where she is unable to get control of your account if you open a different one?", "If that's the case, the sooner you go to social services and the police, the sooner you'll be getting $400.", "Definitely speak to a councillor at school. They'll be able to confirm this is correct or help you change it. If it is correct, speak to your dad and see if he can redirect some of the money to an account in his country so you can access it later. Also check your mum put your correct dob on the documents. People who stout and get aggressive are usually hiding something.", "So just to be clear, the first you knew of it was when you were sent you a letter confirming your mother had access to your bank account, after you were 18 and legally financially independent, without giving you an option to question or challenge it?\n\nThat sounds to me like something they would do if they had an application from, or countersigned by, you as the account holder requesting an additional person had access. \n\nIn other words, it sounds to me as if your mother might have fraudulently claimed you had agreed to it when she applied for access.\n\nHave you ever seen a document detailing the process for a parent be granted access of their adult child's account, or are you basing your understanding of it on what your mother has told you?", "You kind of are paying tax, directly to your mother. I know that taxes in Scandinavia tend to be higher, but I doubt it\u2019s 99%.", "You need to tell him what you've told us.", "yeah, she gets 3100$ in TOTAL, including the 300 she gets from me.", "To me a lot of what OP says doesn't make sense. I heard that Denmark pays people for going to school, so that part might be true. BUT having 14 Dollars to buy stuff for books, computer parts and being able to still save? I am German, it wouldn't be possible here and any Scandinavian country is more expensive than us.", "not essentially. When you apply for money, you need to provide your living conditions and if your father is in the picture and basically provide proof. They gave me 400 based on everything, and i\u2019m thinking my mother called in and requested it, so they allowed it, because of my living conditions.", "Yeah, they\u2019ve called a bunch of times, asking me what i do with my money and why no rent payments go out through it and what not.", "Denmark allows parents to get full access to accounts. The parent has to request it. Assuming you\u2019ve detailed your living situations while applying for money. At 15, you already get a bank account, and your parent can have access to that when you\u2019re a minor. They cannot access your saving accounts, which is why my mother hasn\u2019t actually checked how much I\u2019ve saved or how much i\u2019ve used from there. She also cannot request access if i don\u2019t live with her, and at least live 30 km away from her.", "usually they\u2019ll deny it if you\u2019re working, moved out and above the age of 25. Basically if you live alone, they\u2019ll deny it.", "Yeah, first step is switching bank. This whole comment section has made me question how trust worthy my bank is.", "yeah, max is 55%, and that\u2019s if you earn a lot of money and live extremely rich.", "I am considering it. I am going on a trip to see his family in India soon. He paid for it so my mother has no say if I can go or not. I will tell him on the trip", "You\u2019re obviously from Sweden and what you\u2019re saying about the legal situation simply isn\u2019t a fact. Single mother or not, once you\u2019ve 18 you get full control over your bank account.", "Sorry... the BANK called you?\n\nI have never, ever, heard of a bank calling people and asking that\n\nSomething is suss here.", "I\u2019d love it if you could link to any Danish banking page saying that an adult\u2019s bank account can be basically be handed over to their parents just because they\u2019ve not moved out yet. \n\nAt 18 in Denmark you are responsible for your own financials, you getting SU is tied to the household income if you live at home but it doesn\u2019t mean your mum can do anything with the money. And your accounts are your accounts. Either she forged something at the banks or your accounts weren\u2019t actually your accounts, they were her accounts and you were using them.", "Nope Danmark dont. Not if your 18, and not mentaly disable. If you will not get money for school you will get early retirement, if your fit for school and SU then parents cant get control without consent.", "Tell them you are being held hostage to not being able to save enough to move out , go to school, etc. maybe your dad can pay the money directly to a school or rental temporarily so you can get out. You need to start saving asap and get her out of your finances or 100% you are trapped and will never be free. 14 dollars is nothing but her actions are very telling. This is abuse. If you are having to hide and concerned about violence this isn\u2019t going to magically get better unless you get out.", "That's not how any Scandinavian countries works at 18 you're adult and parents loses control legally.", "I think that you have severely misunderstood everything.\nI've lived in all three Scandinavian countries. When I wanted to have my parents removed from my account I simply logged in online and removed them.\nCall your bank tomorrow and just change access. It takes 5 minutes to change.", "I would move out as soon as possible. She\u2019s not treating you fairly, she\u2019s stealing from you. NTA, please know that this is not okay.", "I\u2019m not living in sweden, no. As of now, I\u2019m going to switch banks. See if that helps. Because even I know I shouldn\u2019t be getting 14$ out of the 400 i receive.", "Yeah, they\u2019ve done it many times to me. I told them it\u2019s none of their business, they accepted it for the first few times, then said they might need to tax me.. etc..", "I haven\u2019t given my mother consent to get fuld magt of my account before hand, nor is it written down. I will change banks. This comment section has proven I cannot trust my bank.", "Her family telling you to be respectful are the ones who created her entitlement to coerce, steal, and threaten her own child. Wouldn\u2019t listen 1 second to their opinions.", "They lose control, but they can request to gain control, or smth called full-magt if you still live with them. Whilst the option of switching banks is tempting me.", "Unless things are wildly different in Scandinavian countries, banks don't tax you.", "I would go to the police, this is a big case.", "It\u2019s called fullmakt in Swedish, fuldmagt in Danish. If your mum has told you what you\u2019re saying in this thread, she\u2019s not telling the truth. But idk, it\u2019s either that or you\u2019re making this up.", "Full magt demands consent, or you are ruled mentaly unfit.", "Yeah, I know. Which is why I told them, it wasn\u2019t their business.", "Yeah, but switching banks is a first. I gotta get that sorted.", "yeah, fuld magt, I never had the convo about my mom getting fuld magt, she never consulted me about this. I just remember getting the email detailing she would get getting fuld magt. I\u2019m going to switch banks, I am with dansk bank right now, I need to switch to smth else. This whole thing has made me not trust my bank. If everything is extreme, I will convince my father to live here."]}
