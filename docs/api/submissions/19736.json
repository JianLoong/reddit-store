You mum isn't around to see the funeral, you are not TA to not want to get into debt or spend large sums. It's not unreasonable for you to tell your siblings that having paid over \u00a33,000 for your dad's funeral you just aren't in a position to make any financial contribution for your mum's / can only contribute a limited amount (say 1/3 of what the basic option would be) IF your siblings want to pay to have a more expensive funeral then that's up to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would say that for the sake of future relationships, it's worth trying to soften things a little, which is why Id suggest that you say you don't have the funds spare to cover the costs, especially having paid so much to sort out your dad's funeral, rather than saying it's because she wouldn't do anything herself, all of you are (presumably) grieving ad everyone tends to be much more emotional and easily upset at that time and quarrels can fester for ages afterwards . \n\nSo stick to 'I'm not in a position to contribute more than \u00a3xxx' rather than 'If mum wanted a fancy casket she should have planned better like I told her' you are more likely to be able to retain some form of relationship.\n\nYou could also point out that not having a fancy casket doesn't mean you can't have a full service, and that h casket will be covered by followers or a cloth anyway, equally, it's not necessary to have hired case or a wake if you have a low budget. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut I'd stick to *\"I'm sorry, the maximum I can contribute is \u00a3xx, If you're in a position t pay more to pay for the plot etc  that's fine, I don't best to her having those things, but I can't cover the extra costs\"*", "NTA.\n\n>\"giving mum what she wanted\"\n\nShe clearly didn't want it if she was unwilling to get her affairs in orders, especially after the loss of your father. That's when most people realize they need some form of life insurance to avoid ruining others' lives when they leave. It also seems that your siblings want you to take care of it because you forked over so much for the dad's.\n\nIf the other siblings want to provide a fancy funeral, let them and let it be on them.", "NTA. Your mom isn\u2019t going to know one way or the other. I told my kids to do whatever the cheapest option is whenever I die, and take whatever is left of my life insurance money and do something that makes them happy.", "NTA. If other people want this, they can pay for it.", "NTA, they want the big blowout, they pay for the big blowout. If you want to share in the expense, pay your share of the cremation option.", "NTA.\n\nIn a perfect world, everyone would have enough money saved to pay for their own funeral. But not everyone can. There are many people living in dire poverty who have no savings at all, and who will probably never will. I hate the idea of burying them in unmarked and unknown pauper's graves.\n\nSo I do think everyone deserves a simple coffin, and either a burial in a known grave, or a cremation, whichever is the cheaper option. If the deceased has no savings and the family can afford to pay for this basic type of funeral, they should.\n\nHaving said that... if it is known that the deceased wanted something more lavish - fancier coffin, imposing headstone, best spot in the cemetery, huge wake - then the deceased's estate should pay for it. If there is insufficient money in the estate, then sorry, Mum, you get the cut-price option.\n\nPut simply: the survivors of the deceased should not have to go into debt to pay for the funeral.\n\nStand your ground, OP. Your siblings are wrong. If this was so important to your mother, she should have made provision for it while she was alive. If it's so important to your siblings, let them pay for the bulk of it.\n\nIf I were you, I'd get a quote for the cheapest option, and divide it by the number of siblings. That's your share. That's the amount I'd hand over to your siblings. If they want to spend more than that, they can pay for it themselves.", "NTA - It sounds a lot and could put you in debt.", "Nta i dont have a close relationship with my mother and i dont think my sibling would be in position to deal with it, so my plan will be cremation as well.  \n\nPeople act like burial is an obligation", "NTA\n\nTell your brothers to pay for the funeral, they are also her children", "NAH. Your mother has passed, so I definitely don\u2019t want to call her the AH. \n\nI went through a similar circumstances with my mom. She was paranoid about dealing with end-of-life details, and died young. It sucks, but what can you do?\n\nI would say that if your brothers want things a certain way, then they should pay for it.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA.   \"He who pays the piper, calls the tune\".   \n\n\nAnd note, when it's time for decisions to be made, the only people in the room are the ones paying the bills, signing the agreement with the funeral director.  So you could go through with it, determining what the funeral will be. \n\nBut. \n\nI can tell you from experience that the death of a parent is an emotional time for everyone.  More significantly, a person who played a central role in the family dynamic has disappeared from the scene.  And so it is common - and it happened to me - that siblings erupt in irreparable schisms, that forever alter their relationships with each other.   So there's a chance if you do change it, you will lose siblings for the rest of your life.    \n\n\nSo perhaps consider that cost as an investment in your relationship.   \n\n\n\\*OR\\*  You can even say this: \"I am not going to agree to any cost that we don't share equally.  So, even if  you cannot pay now, I will pay the funeral costs in full, and you will owe me 1/3 of that, which you will have to pay me back, in monthly installments, over the next 3 (or 5, or whatever) years.\"   That would be a pretty generous offer on your part - and if they refuse that, then they will at least know they are super duper in the wrong in doing so.  And, later on, when they fail to pay you back, you can say magnanimously \"Fine then.  I am going to completely forgive this loan, so we can both move on.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No graveside. \nYou can do a viewing in a rental casket, then cremation. \n\n\nI see this all the time, and my home is not a pushy home, but we do want to be paid, why sell things familiescannot afford... we'll try to do the most affordable option, but cemeteries opening and closing are getting to be 2k for some unfounded reason. \n\nThank god I know my mom wants to be cremated, but damn sure if she wanted a traditional and never did ANYTHING, she'd be a cremation. I've been telling her just get life insurance or something. But I doubt she has.", "NTA - Funerals are not for the departed, they already departed (hence the name), they are for those who are left behind.  Your siblings want to make themselves feel better by giving her a silk line casket made of endangered wood they can fund it.  Its not your responsibility.  \n\nAnd your mom couldnt be bothered to make plans so she didnt want it THAT much.", "NTA. And I'm an insurance agent so I gotta drill it in people's heads.

OP's siblings can pay for the burial, as they have a massive hard-on for her remains to be eaten by weevils and nasty maggots.", "First of all you have my deepest condolences  \n\nNTA my dad planned his whole funeral. He bought family plots and gifted them to my mom, myself and my siblings. \nThe cemetery was expanding and gave my dad a amazing deal for what he bought. Including our headstones. \nAs we all got older we have planned what we wanted and prepaid for we wanted such as our Caskets. \nEach family plot had 6 spaces 3 on 3. Caskets were not included. Or services.  \n\nMy dad had seen people he knew paying 8k for basic funerals (in the early 80's) and he didn't want that for his wife(my mom) so he bought and planned  it so my mom didn't need that stress.\n3 years latter my dad passed away and all my mom needed to do was to order some catering for the wake and after the funeral. \n\nAnd when my mom passed away my share was $200 dollars. But that was mostly for food due to catering. \nMy mom had made monthly payments on her casket she wanted. White with a beautiful rose shade lining with silver handles. \n\nYou had told your mom to plan ahead. You shouldn't fulfill someone's last wishes if you can't afford it.  \nAnd you have my deepest condolences and sympathy for your loss.", "NTA - This is classic \"funerals are for the living.\"  If the living want something, they can fund it.  You don't and you shouldn't put yourself in financial straits for what your brothers want.  \n\nYour mom will never know whether her last wishes were actually fulfilled.  If they were truly meaningful to her, she would have gotten her affairs in order.", "YTA if it would not cause financial hardship on you if you shared the cost then you're putting the bulk of the responsibility on your other sibling, which could lead to a forever strained relationship. If you can afford it why wouldn't you? Are you still mad at your mom for not planning her own funeral? Also INFO If your other sibling didn't help with your father then yes, it shouldn't be all on you. Any sort of method or ceremony would suffice. And was she sick beforehand? Was she certain she would die and would her illness prevent her from making the proper arrangements? Did you offer to help her get things set up? Did you have a good relationship?\n\nWhatever happens this is heartbreaking to read. Wishing you and your family healing.", "NTA.

Years later when my dad died he requested that because he thought it was hilarious.", "It sounds like your mom didn\u2019t have the money to \u201cget it sorted\u201d or even fix her home. My dad still has no headstone because we can\u2019t afford it and it breaks my heart. I want to pre-pay my funeral but I have no money. \n\nSometimes things don\u2019t get done not because the person couldn\u2019t be bothered but because they had no means. I have extremely strong opinions when it comes to honouring the dead. I\u2019ve even volunteered with our burial society. You mention no inheritance so it sounds to me like your mom didn\u2019t have the ability but wants to be buried with her husband? She died young. That\u2019s sad. \n\nIf YOU can\u2019t afford what she wanted, so be it but if you can and just think she should have done it when it sounds like she didn\u2019t have the means, then you are TA.", "NTA\n\nTo be blunt, funerals are a huge extravagant waste. My father said simply, bury him but give him flowers while he's alive, don't waste then when he's gone. I do still  put flowers on his grave once a year but it's more a sign of respect and love than loss to me. He would hate for us to have spent large sums of money.\n\nRegardless of your belief system, the person is not there so who is all the pageantry really for?\n\nI've told my wife, I'd be happy to just be cremated and even spread in our garden. Have thoughts, raise a glass amongst friends and family but that's all, don't go blowing largebsums of money, I'm not there.", "NTA. You don't owe your mother or your siblings anything here. I believe it's on the individual to account for their post-life expenses, so your mom is TA for not doing that.

If it means that much to your brothers they can handle it. Have them go to the funeral parlor and see how much it all costs. Then compare it to the cost of a cremation. My guess is that they'll change their minds PDQ.", "It sounds like you're mad that your mom just had standard characteristics for someone her age. You are the asshole here, yes. If you don't have enough money make a kickstarter, 6k euros is nothing for a funeral, barely pays for a decent memorial service. Make the events afterwards a fun low key event for the people that knew her, ya might make some new friends that will say \"hey props to them they did this on their own\" \n\nSidenote: do not ever respect someone's wishes to be buried in a casket as a full blown body unless they explain to you exactly why they want to do it. People think this will let them be \"at peace\", but they do not understand embalming tech and modern genetic engineering. Ancient cultures cremated people because they knew that in the future, people could do all sorts of crazy sci fi shit with people's biological material, so they atomized that shit to make sure no weirdo physician scientists could mess with it. If you don't want your mother to come back as a skin walker or something in 2099, use a cremation service.", "This. Don't be mean about it, just stick to the line \"the most I can afford to contribute is _____. We can either work within that budget or if there are extras you would like, then you will have to cover that.\" Be a broken record with \"the most I can afford is this.\" You don't have to explain why, you don't have to justify it. Just \"this is all I can afford.\"\n\nDon't feel bad. You are a good child for contributing and getting your mom a funeral. And she's not going to know. End of life celebration planning helps some people deal with their mortality, it helps some people left behind process their grief... But it's not something that MUST be done. The big fancy box and the giant headstone and the bagpipers and the whatever else costs money... It sadly doesn't change the outcome. \n\nSo you do what you need to do to process your grief. I'm so sorry for your and your siblings loss.", "LOL, youre wanting to protect the familial relationship by putting a debt in there?  \n\nThat will NOT work.  The rule is \"never lend money to friends or family youre not willing to just give away\" because youre not getting paid back and they will hate you for making them pay you back.  \n\nSo OP would be out the money AND have the fractured relationship.", "And she was an adult that made promises", "OP isn't refusing to pay anything at all, they're refusing to pay toward the more expensive options their siblings want.

And also sounds like you're speaking about her and remembering her in a callous and negative way to make your point. If her house was falling down around her, she left no inheritance, etc...clearly she was struggling mentally or financially, one or the other.  \n\nI think you have to look inward and determine what type of service will not pose a hardship and will still provide a way for the family to honor her.  Obviously holding a boundary around a budget for your own financial health is fair, but \"refusing to pay any meaningful amount\" seems extreme, especially if you want to try to do what you can to bring the family together in this moment.  A mother likely simply wants her children to think of her fondly, and for her death to not be a source of conflict and resentment...but rather a time to look back on her life with respect and thankfulness.
