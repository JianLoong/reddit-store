You mum isn't around to see the funeral, you are not TA to not want to get into debt or spend large sums. It's not unreasonable for you to tell your siblings that having paid over \u00a33,000 for your dad's funeral you just aren't in a position to make any financial contribution for your mum's / can only contribute a limited amount (say 1/3 of what the basic option would be) IF your siblings want to pay to have a more expensive funeral then that's up to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would say that for the sake of future relationships, it's worth trying to soften things a little, which is why Id suggest that you say you don't have the funds spare to cover the costs, especially having paid so much to sort out your dad's funeral, rather than saying it's because she wouldn't do anything herself, all of you are (presumably) grieving ad everyone tends to be much more emotional and easily upset at that time and quarrels can fester for ages afterwards . \n\nSo stick to 'I'm not in a position to contribute more than \u00a3xxx' rather than 'If mum wanted a fancy casket she should have planned better like I told her' you are more likely to be able to retain some form of relationship.\n\nYou could also point out that not having a fancy casket doesn't mean you can't have a full service, and that h casket will be covered by followers or a cloth anyway, equally, it's not necessary to have hired case or a wake if you have a low budget. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut I'd stick to *\"I'm sorry, the maximum I can contribute is \u00a3xx, If you're in a position t pay more to pay for the plot etc  that's fine, I don't best to her having those things, but I can't cover the extra costs\"*", "NTA.\n\n>\"giving mum what she wanted\"\n\nShe clearly didn't want it if she was unwilling to get her affairs in orders, especially after the loss of your father. That's when most people realize they need some form of life insurance to avoid ruining others' lives when they leave. It also seems that your siblings want you to take care of it because you forked over so much for the dad's.\n\nIf the other siblings want to provide a fancy funeral, let them and let it be on them.", "NTA. Your mom isn\u2019t going to know one way or the other. I told my kids to do whatever the cheapest option is whenever I die, and take whatever is left of my life insurance money and do something that makes them happy.", "NTA. If other people want this, they can pay for it.", "NTA, they want the big blowout, they pay for the big blowout. If you want to share in the expense, pay your share of the cremation option.", "NTA.\n\nIn a perfect world, everyone would have enough money saved to pay for their own funeral. But not everyone can. There are many people living in dire poverty who have no savings at all, and who will probably never will. I hate the idea of burying them in unmarked and unknown pauper's graves.\n\nSo I do think everyone deserves a simple coffin, and either a burial in a known grave, or a cremation, whichever is the cheaper option. If the deceased has no savings and the family can afford to pay for this basic type of funeral, they should.\n\nHaving said that... if it is known that the deceased wanted something more lavish - fancier coffin, imposing headstone, best spot in the cemetery, huge wake - then the deceased's estate should pay for it. If there is insufficient money in the estate, then sorry, Mum, you get the cut-price option.\n\nPut simply: the survivors of the deceased should not have to go into debt to pay for the funeral.\n\nStand your ground, OP. Your siblings are wrong. If this was so important to your mother, she should have made provision for it while she was alive. If it's so important to your siblings, let them pay for the bulk of it.\n\nIf I were you, I'd get a quote for the cheapest option, and divide it by the number of siblings. That's your share. That's the amount I'd hand over to your siblings. If they want to spend more than that, they can pay for it themselves.", "NTA - It sounds a lot and could put you in debt.", "Nta i dont have a close relationship with my mother and i dont think my sibling would be in position to deal with it, so my plan will be cremation as well.  \n\nPeople act like burial is an obligation", "NTA\n\nTell your brothers to pay for the funeral, they are also her children", "NAH. Your mother has passed, so I definitely don\u2019t want to call her the AH. \n\nI went through a similar circumstances with my mom. She was paranoid about dealing with end-of-life details, and died young. It sucks, but what can you do?\n\nI would say that if your brothers want things a certain way, then they should pay for it.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA.   \"He who pays the piper, calls the tune\".   \n\n\nAnd note, when it's time for decisions to be made, the only people in the room are the ones paying the bills, signing the agreement with the funeral director.  So you could go through with it, determining what the funeral will be. \n\nBut. \n\nI can tell you from experience that the death of a parent is an emotional time for everyone.  More significantly, a person who played a central role in the family dynamic has disappeared from the scene.  And so it is common - and it happened to me - that siblings erupt in irreparable schisms, that forever alter their relationships with each other.   So there's a chance if you do change it, you will lose siblings for the rest of your life.    \n\n\nSo perhaps consider that cost as an investment in your relationship.   \n\n\n\\*OR\\*  You can even say this: \"I am not going to agree to any cost that we don't share equally.  So, even if  you cannot pay now, I will pay the funeral costs in full, and you will owe me 1/3 of that, which you will have to pay me back, in monthly installments, over the next 3 (or 5, or whatever) years.\"   That would be a pretty generous offer on your part - and if they refuse that, then they will at least know they are super duper in the wrong in doing so.  And, later on, when they fail to pay you back, you can say magnanimously \"Fine then.  I am going to completely forgive this loan, so we can both move on.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
