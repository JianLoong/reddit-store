I actually really enjoy playing, but certain events of this past weekend have made me second guess on whether or not I should continue on attending. One member of our group, MT \\[M27\\] , and I started talking to each other. We weren't officially dating, but definitely were both romantically interested in each other. \n\nMT works at a brewery and on Friday my best friend and I came to see him. While MT worked that night, we sat with MT's other two other friends, Tom \\[M28\\] and Alex \\[M32\\] Tom invited all of us to go to another bar after the brewery closed. Tom asked MT to invite another friend of his,Sierra \\[F25\\] out with us because Tom was interested in her. I had never met Sierra prior to this night. We all went to the bar and Sierra showed up way later then the rest of us, by the time she showed up, it was already 1am and all of us were drunk, we all decided to crash at Alex's place because he lived within walking distance of the bar we were at. \n\nThroughout the night, before Sierra showed up, MT was casually touching me, talking with me, and everything. However, after Sierra showed up, it almost felt that every time I was trying to talk with MT, Sierra took this as competition to talk over me, make fun of everything I said, to the point where I just stopped engaging with MT unless he engaged with me first. \n\nIt got worse when we all went to Alex's place, Sierra was all over MT, I'm talking holding hands, touching each other, rubbing each other's backs, it was all really uncomfortable in general. This all continued throughout the whole night, and I did my best to mask my upset feelings at the whole situation, but at a few points throughout the night, MT would come up to me, touch my lower back, my shoulder's, everything, but then go right back to being literally, all over Sierra. \n\nAlex was nice enough to let me sleep in his bed while everyone stayed up and watched a movie together, the next morning I still felt upset by what had happened. I texted MT this message, \" I must be a fucking idiot because in my head, I thought you liked me, but you were all over her right in front of my face which is rude and disrespectful, the least you could have done is had the decency to say you had something else going on.\" and then I blocked him on everything. I know it was immature to say this, but I was still upset, mainly at the fact that he didn't bother to tell me he was no longer interested. \n\nDespite all of this, I still really enjoy playing Magic with all of our other friends once a week, but I am being told by others, specifically Alex and Tom, that I should sit a few sessions out since it will be awkward for MT and possibly others that attend since I sent him that text and blocked him on everything.

Do you know if anything happened between MT and Sierra after you went to sleep while everyone else was watching a movie? Seems to me that you were sending mixed or too subtle signals while Sierra showed her intentions clearly, and you probably overreacted. I don't see any problems with going back to the game nights, unless MT makes it a problem.", "NTA to go, but consider whether Alex and Tom, who I assume have been going to game night a lot longer than you, are really saying that it will be awkward for you, because MT, and possibly them, will make it awkward for you.", "Text them back and say he's hte one who flirted with you all night then had his hands all over another girl while still making moves on you, if anyone should skip a few weeks because of awkwardness it's him and you can't believe they'd suggest you skip.\n\nYWNBTA. Also lets be honest, if you skip MT will create a narrative for the group about what he thinks/says happened and you'll come back a few weeks later with people thinking weird shit about you. Go, tell anyone who asks that he was being gross and weird and that you had thought he was a decent guy. Don't let him make you uncomfortable in a group you enjoy due to his behaviour and don't let him mislead others about what happened.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s awkward and uncomfortable for MT for a REASON, if he wants to be a playboy, this might happen a lot. If he was going to play with someone\u2019s feelings, shouldn\u2019t have been someone in your group. \n\nFuck MTs feelings! He didn\u2019t care about yours!", "Why are you taking advice from his friends on what to do?\n\nThat was a polite text. A better reaction would have been ghosting him and ignoring him, indifference is the best revenge. \n\nGo and play. Enjoy yourself and don't engage with them anymore, unless its for gaming. It sounds like a big mtg group so it could be possible. \n\nNtA but he is, so please don't forgive or forget this. He showed you who he is, believe him", "Eh\u2014NTA but you could have approached it differently. If you were dating and he was all over her that's a different story, but it seems like you and MT were flirting and you were expecting it to go somewhere that night but it didn't. A follow up text to see if you were on the same page would have been more appropriate since you really don't have any claim to him (e.g. he isn't your boyfriend), but I get it, who hasn't sent these types of texts while drunk?\n\nThat said, you can definitely go back to your meetups. I'd maybe reach out to him and say that you responded out of emotion and that you hope things can be cool between you going forward. Mention that you'd still like to attend the meetups and hope things won't be too weird.  \n\n\nEdited: wording", "Agreed! I would sit 2-3 out. Time will allow emotions to fade. Personally, I would just say that the next two or three weeks are really busy but I\u2019m looking forward to meeting up with everyone once my schedule resumes to normal. \n\nI\u2019ve been in your shoes before and I went to events I really liked after a situationship blew up. It was awkward and I wasn\u2019t over the \u201cbreakup\u201d. I ended up burning bridges and stopped attending the events all together.
