Why would you want normal? NTA.", "NTA. You said it perfectly - taking care of yourself should be your top priority. If that means cutting people out of your life who invalidate your identity, then that\u2019s what it means.\n\nYou extended a huge olive branch by being willing to sit down and have the uncomfortable conversation. If they\u2019re not even willing to consider that you being queer does not make you possessed and/or pedopholic, then I can\u2019t imagine that interacting with them will be good for your mental health. You\u2019ll either be constantly fighting or you\u2019ll feel like you have to hide your identity in their presence and stay quiet to keep the peace.", "INFO: How do YOU feel about it? It's your decision to make whether you want them in your life or not and if you want have those conversations over dinner. A vacation certainly seems a bit much.", "NTA, do what is best for you and your mental well-being.", "NTA. Tell them nothing can possibly be \"normal\" while they are accusing you of being a monster who molests children. If that is what they think of you, you cannot have a \"normal\" family relationship with them. That is not something you accuse family members of unless it's true, and if you believe it's true that a family member of yours molests children, then you should not want a relationship with them.\n\nIt is not true, of course. But the fact that they can accuse you of something so horrible, despite knowing you well enough to KNOW it's false, suggests they are not healthy for you to associate with. Make that VERY clear to them. Ask them how much they would want to associate, in loving family fashion, with someone who believes they groom children for rape.", "NTA for cutting off people with whom your relationship is toxic, 'family' or not. Sorry you have to grow up with them.", "NTA. You are on firm ground. Besides, you have no guarantee that your family isn\u2019t going to try to stage and \u201cintervention\u201d or otherwise try to \u201csave\u201d you.", "Don't do it. It's a trap!\n\nAlso, NTA.", "NTA. \u201cbring things back to normal\u201d sounds suspiciously like trying to get you to ignore who you are to conform to who they want you to be.", "NTA.

If you do, a meal make sure it's in a public place. Feel free to leave if they push you. Have your own transportation. I'm kind of jaded. Wish you luck.", "NTA.  Your family doesn't respect you or your choices.  They prolly see \"normalization\" as an opportunity to get you \"back in line.\"\n\nAs the earlier commenter mentioned, you've extended an olive branch and your family has already disregarded it.  It would be lovely if your family could grow and change and eventually accept you in your totality.  Unfortunately, I highly suspect that type of growth is beyond them.\n\nPlease do NOT put yourself in an uncomfortable situation; if your family cannot and will not respect you as a person, then maybe you will be better off without being in contact with them.", "NTA", "That\u2019s my conundrum.

It sounds like you'll need to be very firm about your boundaries. You're NTA, by any means in this. It seems like there is definitely a lot of unpack with all of this. Make sure you take care of yourself first and foremost."]}
