Put her food on the table and start eating mine while quietly watching YouTube with my breakfast. After a while she starts to wake up. She says \u201chey\u201d and I tell her I got her breakfast. She says thanks and sits up in bed. Sits there for a sec and then gets up and goes to the bathroom. She\u2019s comes back out in a robe and starts eating breakfast and asks why she wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes. I tell her what happened and she looks confused and a little upset.

Her mind might immediately go to \"what did he do while he was helping.  Did he touch me, did anything happen.\"\n\nAt least now - she knows nothing happened.

If she was covered in puke or actually in danger, it would b different, but that\u2019s obviously not the case.", "I suppose if you both were THAT close it would have been expected but it doesn\u2019t sound like that. \n\nEither way NTA", "Nta.  Hypothermia in a temperature controlled room...she probably would have complained if you had touched her too.  She was safe and you're not responsible for her decisions.", "u/Minecraftdudeofstuff is NTA\n\n1) You are supposed to be a mind-reader?(to know what she wanted you to do rather than what she told her-let her sleep)--Um no. \n\n2) Let's say you did keep her \"awake\"(doubt she'd remember that either), but she could have had vague memories of your hands on her body--that could have been a complete clusterf\\*ck--so hard NO.  \n\n3) Not your responsibilty to make sure she's dressed or dry. \n\nInfo: was the room particularly cold? I mean was there really a possibility of hypothermia? when she was UNDER a blanket? and towel? At the worst her wet hair might have taken longer to dry?  And would not have been under blanket--if she was that cold-she likely would have woken up.", "She probably wants you, and you not showing you care enough about her to stop her getting \u201chypothermia\u201d hurt her feelings!", "Nta, I mean it my part I would of feel more weird if a friend would see me naked lol \ud83d\ude06 I might the only.. \n\nImagine it went south and she thought you were trying to do something to her since she was extremely drunk.. \n\nAnyways yes you aren\u2019t the AH", "SMALL POLL:  \nWomen--how many of you in this exact scenario would wake up your drunk female friend and shove them in PJs?\n\nMen--how many of you in this exact scenario would wake up your drunk male friend and shove them in PJs?\n\nAnd every other stamp of sexuality pick your drunk platonic friend of choice--would you shove them in PJs when they have already climbed beneath covers in a towel and said they are going to sleep?", "OP- to be honest with you, it sounds like your friends is upset for a different reason. The assumed responsibility she placed on you to dress her while she was intoxicated and naked seems a bit weird to me. Sounds like she might be attracted to you or at the very least wish you would\u2019ve taken the initiative to clothe her like a hallmark rom-com.\n\nNTA.", "I would ask her how she would have felt if you were to have put her in pjs. Its a lose lose but on your end you made the right move", "NTA. It sounds like you were a good friend to her", "NTA. Your responsibility is to make sure she\u2019s safe and makes it through the night alive. If she had vomited while passed out, yes you would have to go help her. But if she wasn\u2019t ill, unless it had been discussed ahead of time there would be NO reason for you to touch her or take the towel off of her. Maybe talk about it NOW to figure out what the protocol SHOULD be, and maybe next time you do help her dry off, get PJs on, wrap her hair in a towel, etc.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure she was just a little unsettled having not remembered how she ended up naked and you being the only other person there. As a woman, she has every right to be cautious (or just as a person, of any gender), but agree that you did the right thing. Interfering with her drunk and naked would have been a bigger issue. Leaving her alone to fall asleep was the correct call", "NTA.\n\nShe's telling you this AFTER she got drunk and then fell asleep under some blankets.  And she woke up without hypothermia.\n\nSuggestion: don't get so inebriated that you do something weird and then expect other people to do what you want them to do.", "NTA. I pretty much agree with what everyone else is saying, but if you weren't sharing rooms and she still fell asleep in a towel, would she even bother with the hypothermia claim or blame anyone else for not being a mind reader?", "NTA. Bit dramatic. I would have appreciated the breakfast and the fact that you didn't try and keep me awake to dress me or anything, I don't appreciate that kind of stuff. I guess you know in future what they would like from you but definitely NTA here, they might just be a little embarrassed or idk seems like there's underlying stuff here.", "NTA, but ROTFL\n\nHypothermia? In a bed in a hotel room? \n\nHad you taken a 'Way-Back' machine to a hotel in the 1700s? Had nobody stoked the fire? \n\nI'm dying here. \n\nMaybe Ms. McDrinky should monitor her alcohol intake, instead of expecting someone to Jammie her up and tuck her in.", "It is her responsibility to take care of herself in the first place. If she was that much concerned then why the hell she is over drunk. NTA", "She probably would have complained if you had put clothes on her.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  You would have been very vulnerable if she started crying rape because in her drunken state she didn't recognize what was gong on when you tried to put PJs on her.  You made the right decision.", "NTA. Friend's claim just sound like embarrassment. Us naked sleepers are either severely misinformed about the safety and protection of pajamas or superhuman if you can freeze to death under the covers in a heated building.", "YTA\n\nLetting her sleep, making sure she was well covered with blankets, was the proper thing to do.\n\nThe only thing I criticize is that when she woke up you didn\u2019t give her some clothes before she got out of bed.", "Agreed. What happens if she thinks he dressed / touched her without consent and starts saying he assaulted her?  He's now screwed for life.", "This right here\u2026.if she didn\u2019t remember going to bed she wouldn\u2019t remember how she got into PJ\u2019s and probably be pissed for a totally other reason!", "I did my time in the trenches dressing someone fighting against me (child). I'll be damned if I do it for someone  who is an adult, was warm enough, and might accuse me of something if I did wrestle them into clothing", "This! Definitely NTA", "I came here to type out this exactly. Hypothermia in a hotel room? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f honestly.", "I love sleeping in a towel after a shower and I\u2019m happy I\u2019m not the only one.", "Haha \ud83d\ude02 you are funny !!", "But him helping her into pajamas would have given him a better view of her...", "I honestly thought she was upset that her coming on to him in this manner did not work.\nI\u2019m possibly completely wrong, but it\u2019s how I read it", "Aurora borealis", "That\u2019s a good way to get a sexual assault charge if OP made a move.", "But he'd have jumped out. She'd 26", "The heating units at hotels are so complicated they just want to freeze you to death to harvest your organs \ud83d\ude02", "Tonight's the night you freeze to death, RIP", "Actually no he should not put PJs on her next time.  He should do exactly what he did this time, respect her space n leave her be in a safe environment. They are not a couple or FWBs you dont just start dressing your platonic friends naked in a towel as they are clearly too drunk to take care of themselves", "I hate when people bring the door thing up! You put it very well. \n\nI haven't seen that Mythbusters episode, but who would think to take off their life jacket in that situation?", "Makes me think she's maybe crushing and disappointed op didn't take advantage at all.\n\nJust to be clear, op was right to do nothing at all. Don't touch drunk naked people who are safely in their bed", "Well then the ones I have stayed at was trying to cook us, that must mean they\u2019re run by cannibals.", "Yeah there is def some deeper reason for her upset. I cannot believe she really thinks she couldve gotten hypothermia in a heated room and sleeping naked is just\u2026 a normal thing people do. She pulling at straws. What\u2019s the real reason?\n\nedit: typo", "Agree.", "For real", "Lolll"]}
