Put her food on the table and start eating mine while quietly watching YouTube with my breakfast. After a while she starts to wake up. She says \u201chey\u201d and I tell her I got her breakfast. She says thanks and sits up in bed. Sits there for a sec and then gets up and goes to the bathroom. She\u2019s comes back out in a robe and starts eating breakfast and asks why she wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes. I tell her what happened and she looks confused and a little upset.

I would have probably remarked \"Sweet Dreams\" and left it at that.\n\nNow I'm sure somebody is going to point out that the drunk girl might not be thinking straight.

If you were to help her get dressed then she possibly would eb questioning what else happened....", "NTA.

Her mind might immediately go to \"what did he do while he was helping.  Did he touch me, did anything happen.\"\n\nAt least now - she knows nothing happened.
