Put her food on the table and start eating mine while quietly watching YouTube with my breakfast. After a while she starts to wake up. She says \u201chey\u201d and I tell her I got her breakfast. She says thanks and sits up in bed. Sits there for a sec and then gets up and goes to the bathroom. She\u2019s comes back out in a robe and starts eating breakfast and asks why she wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes. I tell her what happened and she looks confused and a little upset.

Her mind might immediately go to \"what did he do while he was helping.  Did he touch me, did anything happen.\"\n\nAt least now - she knows nothing happened.

There was zero harm and zero risk.\n\nYour friend is putting some really bizarre expectations on you like she's a child and your her parent or that you are her romantic partner. That's, again, not ok.\n\nNTA but she is.", "NTA but Kayla sure is. Why is she blaming you that she chose to get blackout drunk? It's not like she caught her hair on fire and you couldn't be bothered to throw water on it  She was perfectly safe so you let her be, which was  by far the wisest thing to do  Put some distance between the two of you. A LOT of distance.", "NTA You are not a mind reader.  Also, rassling with someone while they are drunk is never fun.  And no, you are not going to get hypothermia in a warm hotel room under blankets and a damp towel.  LOL", "NTA", "NTA  And I think leaving her alone covered up in bed is less creepy than forcing a drunk person to let you help dress them in pjs.", "NTA. Just tell her that in the future you also will not be dressing her.", "NTA\n\nI think was a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation...had you helped her dress she probably would've flipped out for touching while she was naked and impaired.", "NTA at all!", "NTA. Unless a woman tells you \u201cput clothes on me\u201d always safer to leave her naked body alone, especially if she was drunk. You could have been accused of all kinds of things, especially if she can\u2019t remember the evening. You handled that the best way you could have and were respectful. That could have gone way worse had you decided to just help her out and get her dressed.", "Absolutely not. Never touch anyone who\u2019s drunk while they\u2019re naked without consent. Doing anything similar to that is putting you at risk - NTA.", "Indoors, in bed, in blankets = totally off limits without consent. If it had been a snowbank, it'd be a different story. I'm not sure where the line is between the two, but you're NTA in my book.", "NTA- youre not her caretaker. She wasnt in any danger, so you had 0 responsibility to make her get dressed.", "NTA. OP do not listen to this friend on this. What she is suggesting will only get you accused of some form of sexual assault if you did that to someone else and the woke up the next morning not remembering what happened trust me.", "NTA. She passed out drunk, under the covers, and it would have been much more awkward for you to try to dress her or tell her to get dressed. If she was too cold, she would have woken up and could have put clothes on herself. You're not responsible for dressing her. She's an adult. I think you did fine, and even brought her food in the morning.", "NTA. No, she\u2019s not getting hypothermia from sleeping in a towel after a shower. She was in doors. I\u2019m assuming the place is heated. She had blankets. \n\nShe\u2019s freaking delusional. Don\u2019t let her even convince you she was in danger of hypothermia. \n\nAlso, she is not your responsibility. It\u2019s not your job to make sure she was in pjs. \n\nAnd let\u2019s be real: had you gotten her into pjs, she\u2019d likely be mad at you for that too.", "NTA She was not going to get hypothermia. If anything, had you been insistent about her staying awake, she would likely been pissed at you while drunk, and had you offered to help her dress as she suggested, that would have put her in a much more compromising position with her. It\u2019s always good to look out for your friends when they\u2019re drunk, but she wasn\u2019t in any danger.", "NTA. Depending on your friendship level waking her to dress would have guaranteed you seeing her make, while drunk.\n\nWhereas without her direct consent or request you let her sleep, covered, as she chose.\n\nYou showed her great respect and preserved her dignity by letting her sleep in the towel and not forcing a situation.", "You\u2019d be the asshole if you dressed her up. NTA.", "NTA. Having evidence that you did ANYTHING to her while she was naked and incoherent would have been a terrible idea.", "Sounds like you did your best to be a good friend. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH either but is probably embarrassed. You did good, kid", "I take showers at night and I sleep naked.  I have never gotten hypothermia and I grew up in Michigan.  She's being ridiculous.  Unless your hotel didn't have heat, she was fine.  NTA", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s a grown woman. She\u2019s probably just sad you guys didn\u2019t have sex or something. \n\nTrust me, had you helped her into something the next day she probably would have gotten mad at you for \u2018taking advantage of her\u2019 and \u2018seeing her naked\u2019. \n\nShe was too drunk to take care of herself and that is 100% her own damn fault", "Lmaooo you know how many times I\u2019ve fallen asleep in a towel?  It\u2019s weird I know, but it\u2019s not the sort of thing you get *hypothermia* over\n\nYou get hypothermia when you go swimming in cold ass water, like when it\u2019s 40 degrees out and you decide to go swimming at the beach.  not from a towel. Under blankets.  Is she real?  \n\nNTA and she needs to get over it", "NTA she was safe, covered, warm, and unmolested. You listened to her preference to \"just go to sleep\" and honored it. I get she's trying to justify how awkward it was to wake up naked by rewriting the night, but the truth is she chose to get stupid drunk and you respected her words and her body.", "NTA - like others have said it wouldn\u2019t be very likely for her to have gotten hypothermia. It could have been mindful of you if you\u2019d asked if she wanted to change into her pyjamas, but at the same time why would you? For all you know this is how she likes to sleep. I get that she may have felt somewhat embarrassed, but there was no need because you respected her privacy", "Guessing none of you are prude here and don't care to see each other naked.\n\nNTA for both of you, that was just something that never came up before. If it happens again, you now know what she'd like you to do.", "NTA\u2026 and risking ending in vomit??? No way!! She was in no danger so what does it matter is she was naked?", "This is a friend of the opposite sex. I would hesitate to put them in PJs too. NTA.", "NTA. You did the right thing by not touching her. If I was in her situation I would have been more uncomfortable knowing someone else dressed me without getting an okay", "NTA. She's a big girl now and can put her PJ's on all by herself", "NTA, she's lashing out because she's embarrassed about being so vulnerable.", "Were you guys staying in an igloo? Tent? An air mattress in the middle of a blizzard? Really? Hyperthermia? Wow! I must say that that is a real stretch. But I would say NTA. But I will say that she is hilarious for thinking that hyperthermia was even an option in a hotel room. Please elaborate on this. I sure wish I was friends with you guys because you both sound hilarious", "That was my thought. \nInstead of reading this post, it might have been \"AITA: was I a creep for pulling the towel of my drunk asleep friend and getting her into a pyjamas\" after she got embarrassed or creeped out OP saw her naked. \n\nTo me saying \"okay\" was the safest bet when she announced she was going to sleep. You never know how people will react in situations like this.", "Bingo. You and u/hummingelephant nailed it. (Also, I love both of your usernames!!)", "Exactly right", "I read this as she\u2019s either incompetent/helpless personality or making a pass at OP. I\u2019d like to think she\u2019s not incompetent or normally acts helpless, so that suggests the third option.", "\u26c4\ufe0f \u26c4\ufe0f", "She's probably into OP and disappointed that OP didn't make a move.", "Honestly if any of my friends other than maybe my bestfriend, got me naked when I was drunk and dressed me I would be incredibly creeped out.", "Would it have been nice?!?? No. This girl is frankly nuts if she thinks her friend clothing her is a reasonable request.", "This is honestly the only thing that makes sense. Some bizarre fantasy in her own head where she wanted to flirt and is mad OP didn't read her mind and is now rationalizing a ridiculous argument to justify her annoyance.\n\nI've seen people do crazier things....", "Even if that was the case. She was drunk and I\u2019m not bill Cosby", "Unsolicited advice: do not date her. She is unintelligent at best, manipulative at worst", "No I haven\u2019t. She\u2019s just my friend", "No", "Why not just turn up the heat?", "That or she was just really drunk?", "NTA\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. I would be reluctant to share a room with her again. Her behavior isn't reasonable.", "No no no no no. You were right in everything you did that night. I'm just trying to help you in the conversation you and your friend are having going forward.", "Be careful. She doesn't seem to understand basic boundaries or have respect for them.\n\nThat might not bode well for you in the future.", "obviously that works but they still keep the rooms -300 degrees upon showing up \ud83e\udd23", "Oh okay. My bad. I thought you were implying something else. I shouldn\u2019t have jumped to that conclusion", "Your friend is either a moron or this is some way way overly complicated way of her being attracted to you and secretly wanting more and somehow twisting the fact that you didn't read her mind and cross major boundaries into your fault.\n\nEither way, I'd be super wary of this person.", "Nah. It was a reasonable conclusion. That's why we have conversations instead of sentences."]}
