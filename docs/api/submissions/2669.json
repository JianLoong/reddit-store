Came back in just her towel and just curled up under the blankets in her bed and said she was going to sleep. I thought it was a little strange but I didn\u2019t think anything was wrong with it so I just said okay and went to sleep soon after. \n\nThe next morning I wake up before her. See she\u2019s still deep asleep so I go down to the breakfast buffet and grab food for her and I because I just think it\u2019s a nice thing to do for her. Get back to the room. Put her food on the table and start eating mine while quietly watching YouTube with my breakfast. After a while she starts to wake up. She says \u201chey\u201d and I tell her I got her breakfast. She says thanks and sits up in bed. Sits there for a sec and then gets up and goes to the bathroom. She\u2019s comes back out in a robe and starts eating breakfast and asks why she wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes. I tell her what happened and she looks confused and a little upset. She asks why I didn\u2019t just help her into pajamas or something. I tell her she didn\u2019t ask me to. And she\u2019s still upset she tells me I should have anyway. It\u2019s November and she\u2019s naked and probably soaking wet. She could have gotten hypothermia or something. I told her I didn\u2019t think of that and I was sorry. But she just hopped in bed and said she was going to sleep. Didn\u2019t tell me she was cold or needed help or anything so I didn\u2019t think of it. \n\nWe\u2019ve been talking about it since then and she\u2019s not mad at me or anything but she does think I should have done something so we agreed that we should put this here for judgement\n\nTL;DR: friend got drunk and went to bed in a towel. Then got upset next Morning that I didn\u2019t help her\n\nEDIT: To clarify. She didn\u2019t want me to dress her while she was asleep. She wanted me to keep her awake and just help her get into pajamas.\n\nEDIT2: Kayla has been reading the comments and asked if she could come over tonight to talk about things and clear the air.

I would have probably remarked \"Sweet Dreams\" and left it at that.\n\nNow I'm sure somebody is going to point out that the drunk girl might not be thinking straight.

I would have just let her sleep it off also.", "Nta. If she actually was soaking wet then her bed would have still been wet.

Your NTA and she\u2019s dumb", "NTA She is not a child that needs to be helped into sleeping clothes, plenty of people sleep naked, and yall were in a hotel with heating so hypothermia is not a concern.

How does a grown fucking adult think that their friend is responsible for clothing their fucking drunk ass like a babysitter? Of course you would be NTA if this actually did happen.\n\nAgain NTA, tell her to hire a caretaker if she's so infantile that she can't be responsible for dressing herself when she's drinking", "NTA. a lot of people think she could be trying to trap you into committing sexual assualt, which is likely. personally i almost feel like she just wanted you to help her so you\u2019d see her naked, maybe she likes you? it\u2019s so ridiculous to think you\u2019d get hyperthermia from that, and you aren\u2019t responsible for her", "Nta at all,\nIf you helped her into clothes and she was upset at any point you could have ended up in handcuffs staying out of that is the only reasonable thing a friend can do.", "NTA she is an adult she can watch her alcohol intake", "NTA; this is so pure \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA you made the right decision. If you were to help her get dressed then she possibly would eb questioning what else happened....", "NTA.  Doing something like that while she didn't have the ability to consciously consent to is it a recipe for disaster.  \n\nImagine the opposite - she wakes up the next morning and says \"Wow, I don't even remember putting my PJs on, and you say, \"Oh, I helped you\".  Her mind might immediately go to \"what did he do while he was helping.  Did he touch me, did anything happen.\"\n\nAt least now - she knows nothing happened.  She needs to be thankful for that peace of mind and KNOWING she can trust you when she is in a vulnerable state.", "NTA. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t expect any of my friends to help me get dressed if I drunkenly climb into bed without clothes on and say I\u2019m going to sleep, and I wouldn\u2019t offer to help dress anyone if the roles were reversed. \n\nHypothermia while sleeping under blankets in a hotel room?

I disagree with her on that I think you did the right thing. Fyi  hypothermia  needs to happen under extremely cold conditions and you were in a hotel room with access to a personal ac/heating unit. So the hypothermia bit wouldn't happen in this case", "NAH, that is it.", "That's a sticky situation to be in, I mean you COULD have helped her but that raises all sorts of consent issues because you're not only seeing but touching her body without consent. I mean I get why she is upset but you did right to err on the side of caution to just leave her be.", "NAH\n\nBecause she isn't upset and doesn't make a drama out of it.\n\nYou are absolutely N T A though.

Babysitting is not. \n\nDrinking means risking vomit in your hair, having to go back to the bar for your phone the next day, explaining embarrassing calls to an ex, sleeping in a wet towel/without your retainer/with your shoes on, etc. It\u2019s the nature of the thing. If you\u2019re not willing to put up with the usual litany of annoyances occasionally, don\u2019t drink. Even the best busybody of a friend can\u2019t anticipate every potential discomfort and shouldn\u2019t be expected to.\n\nAnd speaking as a recovering alcoholic, it\u2019s a really bad idea to get in the habit of assuming that other people will intervene to prevent the stupid choices you might make once you\u2019re drunk, even about little things like damp sheets. Just FYI. \n\nNTA", "NTA probably would have counted as sexual assault if you tried to dress her while drunk even if she asked.", "NTA", "NTA.

Based on her wanting you to help her into PJs, I assume nudity isn't a big deal for you guys, but even still, not touching a drunk, passed out woman in a towel, and covering her up instead is the right call.", "NTA\nBut If she was so drunk how did she take a shower ? Or did she just put towel around herself when she got back to the hotel. My cynical mind went to she somehow tried to seduce you. But I don\u2019t know your history.

Her state of dress is her business.", "NTA, firstly how do you know she doesn't sleep naked all the time?\nSecond, any guy dressing any drunk woman that's not his partner is leaving himself open to all kinds of trouble, I'm not saying your friend would accuse you of anything, but it's a rational thought that goes through any man's mind.\nThird, as you said, she didn't ask for help or anything. You're not a mind reader.... Are you???\nAnd fourth and finally she's a grown woman, she got drunk and fell asleep naked, that's on her.\n.\nAfterthought.\nShe wasn't hoping you'd help her and one thing might lead to another and is now upset that it didn't happen is she?", "NTA: she\u2019s neither your toddler or your elderly mother \u2026", "NTA - maybe she was freaked out and thought something happeneD?", "Even here in the Arctic circle, our hotel has perfectly heated rooms.

But that wasn\u2019t the case. \n\nAlso she fell asleep with a towel on and she was under bed covers. There\u2019s no way she could\u2019ve gotten hypothermia from that.

Hypothermia? Is that for real? She was in a hotel room, in her bed under the covers. \n\nIt depends on what type of friendship you guys have, but if she is going to be drunk and naked you probably should get separate rooms next time. You need to protect yourself from an accusation of sexual abuse. \n\nAs it was, you did the right thing not getting near her in that condition. If she had been in danger because of the cold, or naked over the covers, then you could just have put a blanket over her. Definitely you should not have helped her get into her PJs.", "NTA, you shouldn't have apologised. \n\nWould it have been nice? Sure, but I'd hope but not expect it from a partner, much less from a friend.", "NTA- she is a grown adult who can make her own decisions even if she had been drinking.

And that girl is not your friend, that girl is vying to be your girlfriend. Hypothermia, really? She\u2019s doing mental backflips to find reason for you to be seeing her and handling her naked body.

Like was she just disappointed that she was still in the towel because she was hoping something else would happen between them?", "I think she\u2019s a bit paranoid about the chance of hypothermia. \n\nSounds like this is just a minor difference of opinion between you though, rather an argument, so I\u2019ll go with NAH . \n\nSounds like you have a good friendship!", "Oh fuck, again?", "Yeah\u2026 By the sounds of it \u2014 seems like she has a thing for you and was hoping you\u2019d want to help her + see her naked.
