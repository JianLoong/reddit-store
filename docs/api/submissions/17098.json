It\u2019s for various reasons like light, privacy, etc. \n\nA 25ft monstrosity that is spilling gallons of water into your yard is absolutely worthy of a phone call in my opinion. The punishments from HOA\u2019s can be harsh but you tried to go about it the right way and they said no, so what else are you supposed to do? \n\nI have kids and we have stuff out in the garden during the summer, but we also have a neighbour with a reactive dog. As soon as the dog starts barking and jumping at the fence, I tell the girls to stop shouting and wait until he has calmed down. \n\nIt\u2019s just general good manners and trying to make sure everyone around us isn\u2019t suffering because of what we\u2019re doing.", "NTA. I hate people that say \"kids make noise, live with it\" because no, they don't, if their parents have taught them that making huge amounts of loud noise is inconsiderate to neighbours. Obviously it's fine occasionally but everyday? No way. You tried talking to them. The consequences of their own selfishness cost them $1000 and the cost of fixing the fence. You did nothing wrong. Hopefully they'll learn some consideration for others. \n\nDoes your area not have noise ordinance laws?

Very few things kill home values faster than water damage and unkempt homes.\n\nPersonally, I generally hate HOAs (& snitches) and prefer to live separated from people by long distances\u2026 but if necessity places me in a \u2018neighborhood\u2019, I want it to at least have some semblance of order.\n\nGood on you.", "I am the only person that think is very strange the kids were wake up at 4:30 and 5:00 a.m.?! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.

OP\u2019s would be the one with the water damage, but others have valid noise or visual complaints too.\n\nI also don\u2019t know how a 25-foot-tall monstrosity like that would escape the notice of the HOA.

I can tell you that my kids are only allowed to play outside between noon and 20:00. \nTo my opinion those are acceptable hours for kids making noise outside.

Because who wants kids watching them??? \n\nI feel like this is common sense and good neighborship.

It's a permanent structure so I literally can't do anything about it. I'm honestly surprised the city even gave them a permit to build because of how huge the structure is.
