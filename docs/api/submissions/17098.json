The problem is they built it near a huge tree so it wasn't even a tree house, just a tall platform five feet from the tree. Kids, especially the teens, sat in it and looked down to watch everything we did in our yard. We had a 6 foot privacy fence specifically to afford both ourselves and our neighbors privacy. They could have put the \"tree house\" anywhere since it was just a platform, but didn't. Two other areas of their yard had hedges well over 8 feet tall, in fact, but they didn't put it there. No HOA so I told the property owners the kids sat facing so they could look into our yard and commented often among themselves on what we were doing. No response until I threatened to film the teens when they were making out. Platform came down.

The hoa fined them for a reason.", "NTA, but I strongly disagree with you playing down the sleep and size aspects. \n\nThe sleep thing, all the times OP mentions are *odd, ridiculous* times. 4:30 or 5 am? That is enough to disrupt most people\u2019s sleep. Kids likely screaming and yelling, and the noise of the fans to keep the thing inflated? Hell no. That\u2019s ridiculous. A normal size bouncy castle during the middle of the day or afternoon, fair game. Those are not hours in which you have an expectation of quiet. 12 midnight through 5 Am, hell yes you absolutely do. \n\nSize - OP states it\u2019s large enough to block their view of the mountains, which I\u2019d bet was factored into the purchase price of their home, and is something OP intended on at least *somewhat* enjoying. The neighbors do not unilaterally have the right to deprive OP of that. It\u2019s no different than erecting a spite fence at that height, 25 feet is absurd. That\u2019s a 2 story house that popped up in the backyard. \n\nThe drainage is an enormous issue and directly damaging OPs property. \n\nThe neighbors honestly sound like they don\u2019t want to parent their children, so just throw them outside at the bouncy castle. A day or two of this, NBD at all. But this is a ludicrous permanent solution and wholly unacceptable to be denying other neighbors sleep and enjoyment of their property.", "With serious runoff they are lucky op called the hoa and not the city ( I would have called city and hoa)", "Gave em a chance to do the right thing first anyways. Plus it was rude of them to get an even *bigger* bouncy house  after he already had issues with the first one and they assured him it was temporary. \n\nI also normally wouldn\u2019t side with the snitch, and if they hadn\u2019t escalated I wouldn\u2019t say it was justified to call the HOA.

No kid should be up that late or outside in the early morning making excessive noise. I have kids, they can absolutely be taught good manners.

The end of it was up against a cemetery, and had the ruins of an old house there that presumably became inaccessible when the cemetery got that land about 80 years prior. They knocked down the old house and kept only the old stone fireplace which they converted to a bitchin pizza oven.\n\nI mention this to essentially underscore that they had a very long 1 acre yard that we could see (and hear) from our house due to the hills.\n\nNo HOA, but they almost made me wish we had one after about a year. Husband built a full skate ramp where the old house was and put up a bouncy castle right next to it. He was a SAHD and spent all day the kids were in school smoking weed with a bunch of other stoner dads and skating. Sounds of skateboards on ramps ALL DAY LONG. Ok, almost tolerable, but annoying AF. Then as soon as school was up, bouncy castle motor fires up and kids screaming until 9pm every night. Again, annoying but ok. Everyone is having fun.\n\nHere\u2019s where they went wrong. They wouldn\u2019t allow our teenager to skate with them. Fine. They wouldn\u2019t let any of the neighbor kids come over to hang out with their kids and the bouncy castle. Annoying but your house. Then COVID hit and they went from slightly annoying to BOUNCY CASTLE SKATEBOARD PARTY all day every day while all of their neighbors were WFH. They also got a dog that barked constantly. The wife was also WFH and decided the only effective way to communicate the 100ft from their house to their party complex was to SCREAM OUT THE UPSTAIRS WINDOW.\n\nNow, this wasn\u2019t a cheap area. This place was posh. The only reason we were able to afford living there was that our house was super busted and owned by a crazy old lady (ok less crazy more sweet) who raised her kids there and wanted to make sure other kids lived in the house as long as it was still standing.\n\nAnyway after about two weeks of this all of their yard neighbors held a zoom meeting and we marched over there masked up to let her know we\u2019d start calling the cops. The skateboarding never stopped but the screaming and the dog did.", "You aren't snitiching when it's a 25 ft bouncy castle...... they ain't hiding it\n\nAlso, the up until 1 am is generally not cool in any circumstance if they are being that noisy.
