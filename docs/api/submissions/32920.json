To be embarrassed you have to have at least some semblance of self awareness to know that you did something embarrassing.  Granny can't do that.", "OP - Grannie is only in her late 60s so she knows exactly what she is doing. Being a guest in someone else's home does not give the right to be ungrateful towards them and complain constantly. It's time for her to leave with your MIL and go stay with them, I would not want her back into my house in the near future.", "INFO Does she have dementia?", "I'm sorry, 60 is \"elderly\" to you?", "NTA. But before you force anything, talk to your husband and discuss solutions. Your room is your room, whether she is there for a week or a month.   \n\n\nDo simple things like swapping the hand soap in the guest room. See if there are bedding options that she would like more, etc. But, and this is important, she may be experiencing early onset dementia or other mental health declines. Talk to your MIL and her husband to see if the Grandma-in-law's doctors have said anything.", "It\u2019s about control. The elders believe that they call the shots in the family as they do in her culture. If you and husband don\u2019t follow those cultural norms, you are well within your rights to have her shuttled out and on to MIL\u2019s house.", "NTA, time to go grannie", "So Grannie and your mom gave birth at 15 or before.", "Get Grannie a hotel room on the east side of the building.", "NTA - why isn\u2019t MIL taking her to her place ?", "If it's a short visit maybe try to grin and bear it. If it's long term, send them on their way. NTA and I could never.", "Embarrass her???? She just embarrassed herself! Who creeps into your grandson's bed? Creepy, weird and maybe dementia? Embarrassing her should be the least of his concerns. ewh, just creepy icky ewh", "Maybe go to a hotel until he kicks her to the curb....", "you mean he doesn't think she's already embarrassed herself?\n\nNTA.  It's definitely time for her to move on.", "NTA. \n\nShe knows she's crossing boundaries, and it's okay to enforce consequences. If she can't accept the guest room, she can find accomodations elsewhere.\n\nKick her out before she escalates, maybe lifting a leg and marking the couch.", "NTA.\n\nThis is OUTRAGEOUS!  Your husband's grandmother is just unbelievable.  She obviously thinks she's THE MATRIARCH and you are all her peasants.  You're SUPPOSED to do what she tells you!  In her world, she is the queen.\n\nI think it's time to tell Granny that you are ALL adults and this is YOUR home.  She has to respect that, and she does NOT get to have your bedroom and bathroom.  \n\nShe is going to be offended just because she is highly entitled.  You need to tell her that in 2023, her mode of thinking that she's your boss is outdated thinking.\n\nI've read a lot of posts about Asian/Indian older people being entitled, but this one is unbelievable.", "NTA\n\nClearly you home isnt good enough for her. You should be a good DIL and put her in a hotel.", "My nan with dementia (feel that's acceptable though)", "That could be turned around. It's not the room for the head of the family, it's the room for the head of the household. The person who keeps the household running. And that's OP.", "Completely agree!  Most likely, granny was treated this way and now it's her turn to be in the position of power.", "That's just it - it's all about POWER.", "I thought you were suggesting kink. \"Well I always give my husband spanking sexy times when I find him in bed like that. I assumed you were expecting that too, since you're in the marital bed\".", "Ha ha ha ha! Gold!", "Ha! Didn\u2019t think about that"]}
