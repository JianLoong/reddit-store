NTA \n\nGranny is pushing boundaries beyond their limits and encroaching in a way that negates any respect her age and position merited. For God\u2019s sake, I think there are wars that have been started for less.", "Yeah, how come we always have to respect different cultures but they never have to respect us?", "I would have turned her over and started spanking her with a belt lol her family allows this bs lol", "Right. Or they could put a cot out in the yard so she could have her east-facing morning sunshine.", "Hahahahaha you mean she made OP\u2019s bed and tried to lie in it \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I would have told her that her grandsons balls were on that pillow just 4 hours ago when I licked them...thats the spot he likes to jizz ... lol and proceed to get butt naked and Lay in the bed right next to her. Lol", "Indian parents can be quite entitled, unfortunately. It\u2019s unacceptable", "Someone needs to explain the math to me as well.  How does a 30 year old have a 60 year old grandmother?", "They said Late 60\u2019s..", "Yup I agree!", "The issue Here is they are allowing her behavior", "can you sow her to the sheets?  and then move her like a Tamale?", "Yeah, I agree. Lock grannie in her room.", "Ooohhhh, I do like your tricksy thinking!\n\n- Either she gets help for a real problem, or \n- grannie behaves herself, or \n- OP gets to be guilt-free when she tosses grannie out because they have medical opinion that grannie knows exactly what she's doing - she's just horrible!", "Sometimes people are just plain arseholes.", "I\u2019d be tempted to remind her that\u2019s where her great grandchild was conceived and where the marital relations happen. Just not so politely.", "Lol... you don't understand Indian family Dynamics LOL Indian parents particularly the paternal side have a lot of entitlement and we'll do a lot of crazy things just to show that they're the boss or they can do whatever they want. I started laughing cuz this was exactly what I was expecting to happen lol", "Goldilocks, but the grandma indeed brought it on herself.", "Right. My dad died last year at 82. He would NEVER have done something like this. Hell, at 55 I'd still get up when he came to my house to give him my chair (that's how I was raised, always let your elders have your seat) and he would tell me no, to sit back down. My mom was kind of a battle-ax (77 when she passed) but even she would NEVER have behaved like \"grannie\". I'd send grannie back to where she could sleep in her own damn bed!! \n\nOP, your certainly NTAH!!", "BEST QUESTION EVER. \ud83d\ude4c", "Lol, yeah. Though, I\u2019m convinced she considered it her bed at the time. \ud83d\ude06", "yeah Im indian too, but damn this grandma on some another level, my grandparents were bad but they only acted like that in their own home, that sleeping in her bed and not going out sounds so weird", "Late 60s. Two generations of teen parents can do that. It's likely they were married, but I'm not sure if that's better.", "The girl next door, growing up, had a kid at 15yo. Her mom was 15yo when she was born. Grandma at 30yo", "Thank you, I was waiting for someone to say something!", "Ahhhhhh.  Missed that.  My old 46 year old eyes don\u2019t work too well without my glasses.", "I just snorted my tea, laughing so hard. \nBrilliant.", "Bruh", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "lock grannie out of exterior side of the front door.", "Hehehe. Nice one. \ud83d\ude09", "You win \ud83c\udfc6", "I'd be tempted to stand there and flick ice water on her until she left. \n\nNTA OP.", "\"In fact, we're about to get started. Honey, do you have the fly swatter? I've got the onions!\"", "Hahahahaha awesome! I support this suggestion too.", "I wager she knows that and is trying to make the young couple uncomfortable.\n\nI had a grannie like that but she was much older, like passed away at  95. She would create drama like this if she felt she wasn't being given due attention. I guess she was afraid of being left behind or being forgotten, which was silly, because everyone was always doting on her", "Gross and Crass warning:\n\nWe had sex last night, right where you're lying. I haven't changed the sheets yet. Is it not sticky?\n\nSee if grannie can levitate herself out of the bed.", "True dat!", "But not married, they are indian I guess", "Squirt bottle!", "It works really well on my birds when they are screaming, so I think it would be effective on a screeching grannie.", "Off topic, but when my dad was a kid, my grandma would spray him with water to get him out of bed, so he started running to her bed in the morning. He knew she wouldn\u2019t spray her own pillow with water."]}
