{"id": 13620, "submission_id": "127e6e4", "title": "AITA for wanting my vegetarian son to have meat against my husbands wishes?", "selftext": "For context I (34F) am a vegan, I have been for just over a decade now, and my partner (35M) is a vegetarian. We are raising our son (7) as a vegetarian and will do with our 1 year old daughter too. That being said we always agreed that while we would teach our son why we follow the lifestyles we do and hope to instil similar values in him that he is his own person, if he chooses to go vegan like me or start eating meat we will respect that. As a child I always wanted to be a vegetarian and was constantly denied and belittled by my parents, I never want to put my children through that trauma as I developed a toxic relationship with food as a result. We experiment with lots of different foods and love to involve the kids in our cooking, we have our own chickens in the backyard for our eggs (I will eat these as I know they are ethical) and we grow as much of our own produce as we can so they can learn where their food comes from. \n\n\nUp until last year our son took a packed lunch to school however this year he requested to move to school dinners. While I\u2019m not exactly thrilled with the idea he is old enough now to make his own decisions, I had to tell myself they won\u2019t be serving him poison and he eats very well at home, so we agreed. Last night he approached us very sheepishly and told us that he would like to switch to having the meat options. We were both shocked as we have never seen him show any interest in meat before nor did we think he\u2019d ever really had more than a bite from a relatives fork to try, but he revealed a friend of his had been sharing his dinners with him and he began to enjoy meat. \n\n\nMy husband is furious, he wants to sue the school for negligence and wants to go after the little boys parents for raising a \u201cmeat pusher\u201d. While I am also deeply hurt and upset I can accept that there\u2019s no real way to monitor the kids 24/7 and that at this age there\u2019s no real understanding of what he\u2019s asking for. I\u2019m wanting to let him go on the meat option for the last term and then we can talk to him about it properly in the summer holidays, husband wants to deny him the meat option completely but has said that he can start trying meat properly at a relatives house when we go over for a weekly family meal. His main issue is that this happened unsupervised and is a result of peer pressure as opposed to genuine curiosity, he doesn\u2019t want to encourage it and is comparing it to the kids that have started vaping at early ages because of their friends in school. I don\u2019t want to be dismissive of my husbands concerns, but I also don\u2019t want to do to my son what was done to me with my diet preference.\n\nEdit- Thank-you for everyone\u2019s response. While we know it\u2019s harmless curiosity it\u2019s largely about making sure he is fully informed about the choices he\u2019s making which is difficult when we don\u2019t know what it is he\u2019s eating. I\u2019ll talk to husband, he will calm down but I\u2019ll warn him that it\u2019s coming across as controlling. Neither of us wants to control or restrict our children, we just want them to have the information they need to make their own decisions properly. He can look at food that\u2019s full of fat and salt and understand that he\u2019s making an unhealthy choice there, but also we want him to look at that cheeseburger and appreciate that there\u2019s a reason it might be so cheap to buy. Both are his choice to make and the ideal outcome is that he learns moderation and appreciation for the resources he has access to.", "created_utc": 1680249172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127e6e4/aita_for_wanting_my_vegetarian_son_to_have_meat/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And seriously your husband has issues.   \n\nYour post says his friends SHARED his meals with him, not that he pressured him to try it.   I remember constantly sharing and trading food with my friends at school back in the day.   Kids have done it for eons and will continue to.

Your son wants to eat meat and your husband turned the school into a villain. Children share lunches constantly, there was no way to stop it.", "NTA, your son tried dinners from his friend's dish because they looked interesting and obviously tasted good to him. There was no peer pressure there, but there seems to be peer pressure at home. You are good to fight for your son's wishes, even if they conflict with your beliefs. Food choices should not be a religion.", "NTA I'm glad you are giving your child the option to make his own choices in terms of his dietary habits - like you said, it's unfair that you as a vegan in your childhood was ostracised, therefore someone who loves meat shouldn't have to experience the same thing in their childhood.\n\nGetting a taste of meat from his classmate is perfectly fine, your husband's intepretation that it is \"unsupervised peer pressure meat eating\" is overreacting.", "NTA - Your son is old enough to make his own choices and try new things. If you and your husband don't support him in trying new things, when he grows up he will hide things from you. Overtime this could lead to him resenting you for being overly controlling. If your son came out as LGBTQ, would you support his ability to make his own choices for himself? What if he decided to be Christian/Muslim/Buddist/etc, would you support his religious freedom to choose? Being vegan/vegetarian/meat-eater is also a choice for who he wants to be.", "NTA for the title. However, if you are disappointed in your son for wanting to have meat, fine. Be disappointed privately.  If you are openly showing him you are disappointed, you are not only an a-hole, but very much so, a hypocrite. You suffered for wanting your food choices. Doesn't mean he has to suffer for wanting his. \n\nYour husband is a major a-hole, and very controlling. He's going to lose a healthy relationship with your son if he doesn't support his wishes for something that is completely safe and healthy.", "OP you are *probably* NTA but omg your husband is an AH to the nth degree.\n\ni just hope that you are able to stop husband's madness before he either makes a fool of himself at school or a fool of your son. and that if you manage to prevent that, and give him the all clear to eat meat for the rest of the school term, that you don't try to force him to give it up once you have your little talk over the summer. if he wants to eat meat, let him.\n\nand seriously, sue the school for negligence?! your husband is delusional.", "Veganism and Vegetarianism is A CHOICE. Don't take choice away from children. They aren't dolls to play with. They're just small people. YOU ARE NTA by giving them a choice.", "NTA - I appreciate the consideration you have for your son and his own autonomy. The truth is, no matter how much you moderate what he eats (by only allowing him to eat non-meat options at school), he's in an environment where he is able to get his hands on meat if he so chooses. If meat is truly what he desires you have 2 options: 1) You allow him to make his own choices in which he can consider his options and come to the conclusion. With the added control you have over providing him with vegan/vegetarian options at home. or 2) You actively prevent him from eating meat, which he clearly is going to do on his own anyways, and create this toxic relationship with food in which he sneakily eats meat because he enjoys it, but has to hide it and feel guilty about it. I don't see any harm in allowing him to explore his options, especially if you are providing him the benefits of a vegan/vegetarian diet at home.", "You're handling this really well and giving vegans a good name. So NTA. Your husband, on the other hand, is the kind of vego that gives people ample fodder for dumping on us. \n\nHere's what will probably happen: he'll have the meat option for a while, it'll probably be pretty tasty (you say school dinners so I'm assuming this is in the UK and at a school where the food is decent) but his guts aren't going to like it so much. I've been strict vegetarian for a number of years, my partner goes through periods of eating meat for iron/protein (we both get deficient pretty easy) and omg the farts and toilet issues it causes lol. The one time I ate meat in the last 4 years - a slice of pizza as it was the only food in the house - left me feeling really queasy after. Not for the fact it was meat, my body just couldn't handle it.\n\nIf your husband gets his way meat will turn into a forbidden fruit that he's going to sneak in anyway. Comparing it to vaping is utterly ridiculous and he's acting hysterical", "NTA, for wanting to let your son try meat, but your husband is definitely TAH\n\nYour kids are not extensions of you. Both of them will have their own likes and dislikes, especially as they get older. And eating meat may be beneficial for them as they grow, even if they are eating well at home.", "You are definitely NTA, and your husband comparing eating meat to smoking means he really has issues.", "NTA YOU are on the right track.

The school can't police children sharing their lunches. And he has no way of knowing whether it was a request from your son out of curiousity or the other kid 'peer pressuring' your kid to eat meat.\n\nAs with all things, you need to teach your kid the values he needs to learn at home and support him as he finds his way. The only way to influence how he engages with the world outside your home is the values you instill within him when he is at home. A 'thou shalt not' attitude will only lead to rebellion as he gets older. \n\nYou are taking the correct approach mama.

Will you do this without trying to influence his choice? If not, you're the YTA. \n\nI can imagine how hard this is for you, but consider this: if he's been swapping food, the kid(s) he's swapped with have learned that vegan/vegetarian food is delicious. Also, remember that your lessons have already been instilled with him. He may change his mind later and go vegan. Or he may go vegetarian and have meat only once in a great while.

Cuz it kinda sounds to me a bit like you want him to make the \"right\" choice, aka. the same choice you are making instead of making the choice he actually wants to make and that you'll continue to pester and guilt him until he gives in.", "Clear NTA", "I tried tuna for the first time in school, my mother NEVER bought it at home and didn't for the longest time, and I would swap my sandwiches with my friends if we felt like a change.

I do like that he's open to your son eating meat at family dinners hosted outside the home.\n\nThat said, be careful in how you talk to your son whenever you do have the conversation (like you said over the summer) - he shouldn't be made to feel guilty or ashamed of his food choices.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m not sure why everyone is saying YTA unless you\u2019ve edited your post to a different version. I think NTA but your husband is TA. What I am reading now is that you want to support your child in exploring new foods that he has decided he wants to explore which is really good parenting. Kids will be kids and explore there\u2019s no monitoring that. You\u2019re putting your preferences aside and letting him discover, hoping the school meat is from as ethical a source possible. You\u2019re right this is totally different to children vaping because vaping can pose health risks, though less than smoking does, eating meat has been a part of human diets for a long time and balanced diet with good meat does not cause health risk. Your husband needs to calm down and let his kid find his way in life. You can teach why you believe it\u2019s better to not eat meat without a bias approach and let your son decide as he grows what he prefers. My opinion is that animals have been getting killed for food since time began, it\u2019s just a part of how the world works. Lions and the likes won\u2019t stop doing it. I do think that the way some meat is produced these days is wrong. Unfortunately we\u2019re no longer going out with spears and killing by hand.

I'm ready to really just ban veganism entirely, to tell you the truth. I don't see any benefit to allowing that in our society *at all*. We can \"don't ask don't tell\" and you can \"just happen\" to not choose meat at any given meal for yourself, but the second you make it an ideology to push on others (especially kids), do any animal rights political behavior, set up a \"vegan\" restaurant, etc, you're done.\n\nNo one sees this movement for the evil that it is, and when you get passionate defenses of it from one side and only shrugs and \"kinda weird but w/e\" from the other, it's no wonder they're able to evangelize so well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019d rather the food was ethical but what does make a food \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d you know?", "Plus I can\u2019t talk, I have not got the money to pay for ethical meat, I buy what I can get in LIDL and ALDI, it says British I hope the standards are good", "I mean... keep arguing if you want to, it's no skin off my nose. It's not me who's teaching my child harmful attitudes towards food, nor me with a husband who flies off a handle at his child wanting to eat meat.", "\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f oh damn that's how it's made??? Legit didn't know, lol, he just kept bringing it up. Thank you for letting me know, I definitely don't agree with that shit"]}
