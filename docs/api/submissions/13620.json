{"id": 13620, "submission_id": "127e6e4", "title": "AITA for wanting my vegetarian son to have meat against my husbands wishes?", "selftext": "For context I (34F) am a vegan, I have been for just over a decade now, and my partner (35M) is a vegetarian. We are raising our son (7) as a vegetarian and will do with our 1 year old daughter too. That being said we always agreed that while we would teach our son why we follow the lifestyles we do and hope to instil similar values in him that he is his own person, if he chooses to go vegan like me or start eating meat we will respect that. As a child I always wanted to be a vegetarian and was constantly denied and belittled by my parents, I never want to put my children through that trauma as I developed a toxic relationship with food as a result. We experiment with lots of different foods and love to involve the kids in our cooking, we have our own chickens in the backyard for our eggs (I will eat these as I know they are ethical) and we grow as much of our own produce as we can so they can learn where their food comes from. \n\n\nUp until last year our son took a packed lunch to school however this year he requested to move to school dinners. While I\u2019m not exactly thrilled with the idea he is old enough now to make his own decisions, I had to tell myself they won\u2019t be serving him poison and he eats very well at home, so we agreed. Last night he approached us very sheepishly and told us that he would like to switch to having the meat options. We were both shocked as we have never seen him show any interest in meat before nor did we think he\u2019d ever really had more than a bite from a relatives fork to try, but he revealed a friend of his had been sharing his dinners with him and he began to enjoy meat. \n\n\nMy husband is furious, he wants to sue the school for negligence and wants to go after the little boys parents for raising a \u201cmeat pusher\u201d. While I am also deeply hurt and upset I can accept that there\u2019s no real way to monitor the kids 24/7 and that at this age there\u2019s no real understanding of what he\u2019s asking for. I\u2019m wanting to let him go on the meat option for the last term and then we can talk to him about it properly in the summer holidays, husband wants to deny him the meat option completely but has said that he can start trying meat properly at a relatives house when we go over for a weekly family meal. His main issue is that this happened unsupervised and is a result of peer pressure as opposed to genuine curiosity, he doesn\u2019t want to encourage it and is comparing it to the kids that have started vaping at early ages because of their friends in school. I don\u2019t want to be dismissive of my husbands concerns, but I also don\u2019t want to do to my son what was done to me with my diet preference.\n\nEdit- Thank-you for everyone\u2019s response. While we know it\u2019s harmless curiosity it\u2019s largely about making sure he is fully informed about the choices he\u2019s making which is difficult when we don\u2019t know what it is he\u2019s eating. I\u2019ll talk to husband, he will calm down but I\u2019ll warn him that it\u2019s coming across as controlling. Neither of us wants to control or restrict our children, we just want them to have the information they need to make their own decisions properly. He can look at food that\u2019s full of fat and salt and understand that he\u2019s making an unhealthy choice there, but also we want him to look at that cheeseburger and appreciate that there\u2019s a reason it might be so cheap to buy. Both are his choice to make and the ideal outcome is that he learns moderation and appreciation for the resources he has access to.", "created_utc": 1680249172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127e6e4/aita_for_wanting_my_vegetarian_son_to_have_meat/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And seriously your husband has issues.   \n\nYour post says his friends SHARED his meals with him, not that he pressured him to try it.   I remember constantly sharing and trading food with my friends at school back in the day.   Kids have done it for eons and will continue to.  It's fun to share and experience different foods and it's nice to enjoy the fellowship of friends while sharing food.  \n\nTell your husband to get some therapy, and let your kid enjoy his meat", "Your children are not vegetarian.

Your hubby is a major AH tho.", "NTA\n\n> if he chooses to go vegan like me or start eating meat we will respect that.\n\nIt seems like your husband really only planned to respect your son's choice as long it was the choice he wanted him to make.", "NTA, but your husband is. Your son wants to eat meat and your husband turned the school into a villain. Children share lunches constantly, there was no way to stop it.", "NTA, your son tried dinners from his friend's dish because they looked interesting and obviously tasted good to him. There was no peer pressure there, but there seems to be peer pressure at home. You are good to fight for your son's wishes, even if they conflict with your beliefs. Food choices should not be a religion.", "NTA I'm glad you are giving your child the option to make his own choices in terms of his dietary habits - like you said, it's unfair that you as a vegan in your childhood was ostracised, therefore someone who loves meat shouldn't have to experience the same thing in their childhood.\n\nGetting a taste of meat from his classmate is perfectly fine, your husband's intepretation that it is \"unsupervised peer pressure meat eating\" is overreacting.", "NTA - Your son is old enough to make his own choices and try new things. If you and your husband don't support him in trying new things, when he grows up he will hide things from you. Overtime this could lead to him resenting you for being overly controlling. If your son came out as LGBTQ, would you support his ability to make his own choices for himself? What if he decided to be Christian/Muslim/Buddist/etc, would you support his religious freedom to choose? Being vegan/vegetarian/meat-eater is also a choice for who he wants to be.", "NTA for the title. However, if you are disappointed in your son for wanting to have meat, fine. Be disappointed privately.  If you are openly showing him you are disappointed, you are not only an a-hole, but very much so, a hypocrite. You suffered for wanting your food choices. Doesn't mean he has to suffer for wanting his. \n\nYour husband is a major a-hole, and very controlling. He's going to lose a healthy relationship with your son if he doesn't support his wishes for something that is completely safe and healthy.", "OP you are *probably* NTA but omg your husband is an AH to the nth degree.\n\ni just hope that you are able to stop husband's madness before he either makes a fool of himself at school or a fool of your son. and that if you manage to prevent that, and give him the all clear to eat meat for the rest of the school term, that you don't try to force him to give it up once you have your little talk over the summer. if he wants to eat meat, let him.\n\nand seriously, sue the school for negligence?! your husband is delusional.", "Veganism and Vegetarianism is A CHOICE. Don't take choice away from children. They aren't dolls to play with. They're just small people. YOU ARE NTA by giving them a choice.", "NTA - I appreciate the consideration you have for your son and his own autonomy. The truth is, no matter how much you moderate what he eats (by only allowing him to eat non-meat options at school), he's in an environment where he is able to get his hands on meat if he so chooses. If meat is truly what he desires you have 2 options: 1) You allow him to make his own choices in which he can consider his options and come to the conclusion. With the added control you have over providing him with vegan/vegetarian options at home. or 2) You actively prevent him from eating meat, which he clearly is going to do on his own anyways, and create this toxic relationship with food in which he sneakily eats meat because he enjoys it, but has to hide it and feel guilty about it. I don't see any harm in allowing him to explore his options, especially if you are providing him the benefits of a vegan/vegetarian diet at home.", "You're handling this really well and giving vegans a good name. So NTA. Your husband, on the other hand, is the kind of vego that gives people ample fodder for dumping on us. \n\nHere's what will probably happen: he'll have the meat option for a while, it'll probably be pretty tasty (you say school dinners so I'm assuming this is in the UK and at a school where the food is decent) but his guts aren't going to like it so much. I've been strict vegetarian for a number of years, my partner goes through periods of eating meat for iron/protein (we both get deficient pretty easy) and omg the farts and toilet issues it causes lol. The one time I ate meat in the last 4 years - a slice of pizza as it was the only food in the house - left me feeling really queasy after. Not for the fact it was meat, my body just couldn't handle it.\n\nIf your husband gets his way meat will turn into a forbidden fruit that he's going to sneak in anyway. Comparing it to vaping is utterly ridiculous and he's acting hysterical", "NTA, for wanting to let your son try meat, but your husband is definitely TAH\n\nYour kids are not extensions of you. Both of them will have their own likes and dislikes, especially as they get older. And eating meat may be beneficial for them as they grow, even if they are eating well at home.", "You are definitely NTA, and your husband comparing eating meat to smoking means he really has issues.", "NTA YOU are on the right track.

The school can't police children sharing their lunches. And he has no way of knowing whether it was a request from your son out of curiousity or the other kid 'peer pressuring' your kid to eat meat.\n\nAs with all things, you need to teach your kid the values he needs to learn at home and support him as he finds his way. The only way to influence how he engages with the world outside your home is the values you instill within him when he is at home. A 'thou shalt not' attitude will only lead to rebellion as he gets older. \n\nYou are taking the correct approach mama.

An unconditional YTA for your husband. The conditional part is because you say you're going to let him make up his mind, but then you plan to \"talk to him about it properly\" over the summer. Will you do this without trying to influence his choice? If not, you're the YTA. \n\nI can imagine how hard this is for you, but consider this: if he's been swapping food, the kid(s) he's swapped with have learned that vegan/vegetarian food is delicious. Also, remember that your lessons have already been instilled with him. He may change his mind later and go vegan. Or he may go vegetarian and have meat only once in a great while.

Cuz it kinda sounds to me a bit like you want him to make the \"right\" choice, aka. the same choice you are making instead of making the choice he actually wants to make and that you'll continue to pester and guilt him until he gives in.", "Clear NTA", "I tried tuna for the first time in school, my mother NEVER bought it at home and didn't for the longest time, and I would swap my sandwiches with my friends if we felt like a change. That's not \"peer pressure\", it's a mutual decision and the kids see it as a benefit to them.\n\nNTA, I'd say hubby needs some therapy to deal with his reaction to something perfectly normal. I do like that he's open to your son eating meat at family dinners hosted outside the home.\n\nThat said, be careful in how you talk to your son whenever you do have the conversation (like you said over the summer) - he shouldn't be made to feel guilty or ashamed of his food choices.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m not sure why everyone is saying YTA unless you\u2019ve edited your post to a different version. I think NTA but your husband is TA. What I am reading now is that you want to support your child in exploring new foods that he has decided he wants to explore which is really good parenting. Kids will be kids and explore there\u2019s no monitoring that. You\u2019re putting your preferences aside and letting him discover, hoping the school meat is from as ethical a source possible. You\u2019re right this is totally different to children vaping because vaping can pose health risks, though less than smoking does, eating meat has been a part of human diets for a long time and balanced diet with good meat does not cause health risk. Your husband needs to calm down and let his kid find his way in life. You can teach why you believe it\u2019s better to not eat meat without a bias approach and let your son decide as he grows what he prefers. My opinion is that animals have been getting killed for food since time began, it\u2019s just a part of how the world works. Lions and the likes won\u2019t stop doing it. I do think that the way some meat is produced these days is wrong. Unfortunately we\u2019re no longer going out with spears and killing by hand. The farms around my area treat their animals with respect though.", "Mild YTA to you\nHuge YTA to your husband for wanting to sue and go after the parents of the friend that share meat from his lunch.", "YTA for depriving a child of meat. of *course* he wants to eat meat, no one wants to go without that unless they've been sucked into this evil, horrific, anti-human ideology.\n\nShould be a crime to raise a \"vegan\" kid. I'm ready to really just ban veganism entirely, to tell you the truth. I don't see any benefit to allowing that in our society *at all*. We can \"don't ask don't tell\" and you can \"just happen\" to not choose meat at any given meal for yourself, but the second you make it an ideology to push on others (especially kids), do any animal rights political behavior, set up a \"vegan\" restaurant, etc, you're done.\n\nNo one sees this movement for the evil that it is, and when you get passionate defenses of it from one side and only shrugs and \"kinda weird but w/e\" from the other, it's no wonder they're able to evangelize so well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But sometimes he says \u201cI think I\u2019d like to have an apple/Well I\u2019d like to have an ice cream later so for now I\u2019ll just have some fruit\u201d and that\u2019s much more important for us than him just eating fruit because sweets are bad", "\"the evils of veganism\" LMAO ok buddy. you sound a bit unhinged", "Don't be overdramatic, you grow up eating similar dietary habits as your family because logistically that's easier. It's akin to a muslim family raising their children eating halal food, jewish family, kosher food. A buddhist family bans eating beef at home but usually gives the freedom for their children to eat beef outside.\n\nOP did not ban her children from eating meat and even encouraged him to stick to the meat-option once he discovered he liked it.", "bro its not that deep its a diet that the kid wasn't unhappy with and i'm sure was perfectly healthy. your acting like veganism is a cult or something.", "He has a normal diet, he eats lots of vegetables and healthy grains, he has his junk food treats like every other child, he just doesn\u2019t eat meat. He isn\u2019t vegan as we don\u2019t want him to worry about how strict he has to be with his food, he\u2019s vegetarian. We let him try meat if he wants to, our relatives eat meat and he\u2019s had little bits of their food before but this is the first time he\u2019s expressed proper interest in it. We are not trying to indoctrinate him, I am trying to avoid issues that I have stemming from my childhood of my parents bullying me into something I didn\u2019t want to do whilst also making sure that he is making his choices for the right reasons and not because he\u2019s being pressured into it", "good thing edgy redditors dont get to make up frivolous laws", "No, you do not care about them. Caring for someone/thing means their welfare is important to you and you have made it very clear at several points in this thread that animal welfare is not something that should be important to anyone, at any time, for any reason.", "This person is 100% trying to troll. His comment history has shit about zoos and how the animals are \"probably pissed off that we keep sanitising\" their territory or something.\n\nYou are genuinely insane if you think animals shouldn't have rights. Can't wait to see how natural habitats die out because we don't have necessary pollinators like bees, an insect protected under ANIMAL RIGHTS. It's not an argument about whether a chicken is \"sad\" or not. It's about keeping our planet from fucking dying lmao", "Oh I see, yes he is allowed to explore different foods. He\u2019s never asked us to buy meat before, he has tried it from relatives but there was no follow up from that. The kids are of course told no on occasions, but it\u2019s the \u201cthat chocolate flavoured cereal that is fluorescent pink and smells like bubblegum is not an appropriate breakfast\u201d thing as opposed to \u201chow dare you ask me for sweets you had some last month\u201d thing. We try to let them make as many of their own decisions as they can, but they are still children and do sometimes need that guidance put in place", "my mom never did anything that drastic, thank goodness. she always made me salads and platefuls of veggies, but she let it be known that what i was doing was 'crazy' and that 'there was no reason for it.'\n\nthe disappointment from her was so palpable that you'd think i had announced i was joining a gang lol", "No, sweets are not \u201cbad.\u201d Stop it. Your kid is allowed to eat everything in moderation and he will be just fine. If you\u2019re labelling food and ranking them by how \u201cgood\u201d \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cethical\u201d they are, it will project onto him and it will affect his relationship with food and possibly his body in the future. He is 7. He doesn\u2019t have the mental capacity to absorb information about the sources of food and climate change and make his own informed decisions about what he chooses. Instead, he will simplify (is this good or is this bad) and take his cues from you. Because he wants to please you. He approached you \u201csheepishly\u201d because he already knows you consider this choice \u201cbad.\u201d", "And this is why these vegans are gaining such ground in our society, through the law and in the culture. No one likes them but no one's willing to do anything about it.\n\nLook at what the animal rights crowd is doing in Europe now, emptying milk cartons and harrassing butchers and throwing soup at paintings, knowing full well they'll escape with almost no consequences because no one takes the threat of this movement seriously.\n\nThere's more of us than there are of them, but they grow by the day. Why don't we put our foot down and say \"no, this movement is now done, forever, in all of its forms, and any future animal rights behavior will be punished so fast and so harshly your head will spin?\"", "Ignore his extremist opinion OP, he's abit unhinged.", "> he just doesn\u2019t eat meat\n\nThat's not a normal diet\n\n>We are not trying to indoctrinate him\n\nYour entire reason for not giving him meat on a regular basis is due to a (false and wicked) ideology that you hold.\n\nYour parents had the right idea (in general, not sure of their \"bullying\" methods which may have gone too far). When a kid says \"i want to be a vegetarian because I feel sad for chickens,\" you don't indulge that, the proper response is \"oh, you're confused, little Susie, let me teach you again about the proper order of things and of the ordered relationship between mankind and the animal kingdom. It isn't correct to deprive yourself and sacrifice things for chickens, that is disordered and disturbing behavior, let's take you hunting next weekend to get the proper order of things cleared up for you, yeah?\"\n\nThe principle doesn't apply in reverse, because some things are good and some things aren't. A parent trying to keep their kid away from veganism is doing good - a parent trying to keep their kid away from meat (in even the smallest way, like avoiding it from their regular diet) is doing bad.", "I'm a zookeeper. We have to deal with animal rights whackjobs more than your average joe. \n\nAnd sound ecological management is different from animal rights - I responded to you elsewhere in more detail.", "Did you read what I said? He\u2019s allowed to eat things, we aren\u2019t ranking or restricting things. The \u201call sweets are bad\u201d thing was the rhetoric they we are trying to avoid, we want him to make the choice and understand moderation", "Stop being an unAmerican fascist. And try to recognize that while there\u2019s no shame in having a low IQ, belligerently sharing your basic, unnuanced, ignorant opinions is only making you look bad and not adding anything of value to the discourse here.", "As someone who actually LIVES in the UK, the soup on the painting incident was not about animal rights. It was about global warming and being against the oil industry because it was an OIL painting.\n\nWhy are you so against animal rights? Like... It's not just about vegans, you understand that, right? Animal rights are in place to criminalise abuse, especially towards pets. It criminalises hunting endangered species because they're necessary for our planet's ecosystems. Animal rights are necessary so our planet can keep on surviving lol", "Jesus christ, you really like torturing and killing animals huh?", "Have you ever been to Europe? I live here and have never once seen what you are talking about.", "That comes under animal rights, lol. Animals have rights because we want to protect our planet. These are not two separate ideologies.\n\nYou did skim over the animal abuse part. That is not about \"whether a chicken is sad\". It's about not hitting your dogs. It's about not tying a cat in a bag and throwing it in the river. I have literally seen dogs hung and gutted by their owners and without animal rights in place, then those owners would've never been punished.\n\nYou are using the ideologies that PETA believe in to fuel your hatred, even though that is a standalone group that is run by eugenicists (an actual thing, they want to eradicate autism) and, for all intents and purposes, animal abusers (they actively use kill shelters and put down perfectly healthy animals, as well as stealing people's pets and then proceeding to kill them). Peta, and other groups like them, are not the voice of vegans and it's very obvious that you cannot separate the two.\n\nIf OP was Muslim and they chose to not eat meat due to religion, would you come at them with the same energy? What if they were Jewish? What if the son had an allergy similar to my own brother, so he COULDN'T eat meat? Would they be abusive then? Why is it that you are allowing extremist groups warp your view of normal people so intensely?", "The other commenter has a point, the way he approached you about him wanting to eat meat implies that you really aren't succeeding in what you say you want to do.", "You\u2019re not verbalising a \u201cranking\u201d or restriction. But your behavior speaks volumes (including the preposterous thought that a 7 year old can be presented with all the information about the nutritional values of foods, the sources of climate change, the ethics of animal consumption and food access inequality and make his \u201cown informed decisions\u201d) and he is clearly already picking up on that.", "> not about animal rights. It was about global warming and being against the oil industry\n\nI think the venn diagram there is a circle, everyone who's into one of those causes seems to be into the other.\n\n>It criminalises hunting endangered species because they're necessary for our planet's ecosystems.\n\nNo I'm fine with proper management of the commons and natural resources, just like I'm against dumping toxic waste into the river - not because the river has \"rights,\" but because of the **humans** that will be affected.\n\nLegislation that restricts human activity in the name of sound ecological management = fine\n\nLegislation, or even ideology, that restricts human activity because some chicken or cow might be sad = not fine.\n\nAnd people who say these radical activists haven't done anything yet ignore that they've already succeeded in banning foie gras, dog racing, etc in many places. You really think they won't try to ban meat once they get the numbers on their side? They're very open about it. \n\nIt's never a \"personal ideology\" to them. They feel very free to try to forcibly change **our** diets and ways of life (foie gras bans, etc) when they can. (Yes, I'm aware \"omg don't you know how painful it is for the duck?\" I am. I really, really, sincerely don't care, I can promise you that. Yes, I know it's a \"small thing.\" I don't care. I'm not willing to give these people 1 inch. They want to impose on us, let's impose on them and make veganism a felony and see how they like it)", ">Why is it that you are allowing extremist groups warp your view of normal people so intensely?\n\nWhat \"groups\" do you think I get this from, lol? As far as I can see there's no dedicated anti-vegan or anti-animal-rights group out there. That's the problem.\n\n>If OP was Muslim and they chose to not eat meat due to religion, would you come at them with the same energy? What if they were Jewish?\n\nNo, because those ideologies are very different things and not intrinsically anti-human. I think veganism is an evil ideology. PETA and vegans may have differences but I think both are entirely wrong and bad.\n\nI don't know how you're tying \"saving the planet\" in with \"don't gut your dogs,\" I don't think we have to ban the latter to achieve the former. I don't think that should happen to dogs, but I sort of do think we should repeal even those laws for 5 years as a punishment for vegans. If they can behave for 5 years without talking about veganism or making vegan restaurants and they do 5 years of penance for trying to ban foie gras and dog races, and promise they will never do so again, then maybe we can pass the \"don't torture puppies\" law again", "He was nervous because he knows we don\u2019t eat meat and that it is a hassle to change meal options, it can only be done once a term and it normally incurs a surcharge from the school. They are not really given a huge choice of foods, there\u2019s normally 2 different meals they can pick, if a child is down as a vegetarian they will not be given a meat option at all. He likely wouldn\u2019t have asked if it was something he could choose himself and would have just told us that he was doing it. We told him that it was okay that he wanted to try something different and that we would talk about it", "I kinda completely forgot that the kid in question is 7, which makes OP even more delusional if she thinks what she's doing is in any way a good thing to the kid that won't give him issues with food...", "Children are taught from nursery about fruits and vegetables.

They are taught in school about climate change and how to recycle and help the planet with little things. We are not expecting him to recall the exact carbon output of a cheeseburger, nor do we expect him to know what macronutrients he needs to eat in a day. There are children who think that chicken comes in a packet or that ham is a meat by itself. We are teaching him age appropriate things to introduce him to these concepts", "Right?! It's too much information. The 7 year old is going to short circuit!", "... I'm not talking about anti-vegan groups. If you use reading comprehension, you'd see that I'm talking about extremist VEGAN groups. \n\nThere's a lot of correlation between the laws against hunting endangered species and not abusing your pets, considering both things fall under animal rights. Why can you not understand that? \n\nLike damn, it sucks that fois gras and dog races are banned in some places (show me a source on that btw, because I have literally never heard of either of those things happening), but I don't think those are on the same level as animal abuse and poaching, but I guess that's just me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Exactly", "You might want to do some googling on how foi gras is produced before saying it being banned is a bad thing.\n\nUnless you think force feeding ducks to the point they have six inch aasholes is okay. \n\nAnd I eat meat before the vegan haters come out. Foi gras is just insanely cruel."]}
