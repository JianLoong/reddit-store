After a little while my sister asked me to watch her kids while she did a few errands.\n\nEventually I notice the kids trying to do a trick that looked a little dangerous. So, I told them to stop because they might get hurt. My son stopped right away. My niece on the other hand refused and immediately she fell and totally ate it on the curb. Her face was all bloody and she had knocked out/chipped several front teeth. I called my sister and she told me to take her daughter to their dentist and she would meet us there.\n\nSince they were adult teeth the dentist put back in the two that got knocked out, but they didn\u2019t heal or something and fell out later. The dentist suggested getting her partial dentures until she was old enough to get implants. My sisters insurance wouldn\u2019t cover them though and she had bad credit so she couldn\u2019t get them on a payment plan.\n\nMy sister wanted me to pay for her daughter to get a partial dentures and eventually pay for her implant. I didn\u2019t think it was my responsibility to pay because her daughter decided to do something stupid. My sister insisted since I was watching her it was my responsibility to get her to stop. But there was literally no way I could have stopped her. Even if I had sprinted over in the time between me telling her to stop and her trying the trick again I wouldn\u2019t have been able to physically stop her. I told my sister she needed to teach her daughter to listen when an adult tells her to stop.\n\nRecently my younger son has gotten self conscious about his crooked teeth. So a few weeks ago I took him to an orthodontist to get braces. Paying for them in installments by the way.\n\nMy sister is absolutely pissed that I am paying for braces for his crooked teeth, but won\u2019t pay for her daughter\u2019s teeth. My sister was able to save up to get her daughter the partial denture, but she is old enough now to get implants and wants them because she is self conscious about having dentures.
