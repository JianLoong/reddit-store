We were hanging out on the porch of her apartment building watching out for cars while the kids played on skateboards in the street. After a little while my sister asked me to watch her kids while she did a few errands.\n\nEventually I notice the kids trying to do a trick that looked a little dangerous. So, I told them to stop because they might get hurt. My son stopped right away. My niece on the other hand refused and immediately she fell and totally ate it on the curb. Her face was all bloody and she had knocked out/chipped several front teeth. I called my sister and she told me to take her daughter to their dentist and she would meet us there.\n\nSince they were adult teeth the dentist put back in the two that got knocked out, but they didn\u2019t heal or something and fell out later. The dentist suggested getting her partial dentures until she was old enough to get implants. My sisters insurance wouldn\u2019t cover them though and she had bad credit so she couldn\u2019t get them on a payment plan.\n\nMy sister wanted me to pay for her daughter to get a partial dentures and eventually pay for her implant. I didn\u2019t think it was my responsibility to pay because her daughter decided to do something stupid. My sister insisted since I was watching her it was my responsibility to get her to stop. But there was literally no way I could have stopped her. Even if I had sprinted over in the time between me telling her to stop and her trying the trick again I wouldn\u2019t have been able to physically stop her. I told my sister she needed to teach her daughter to listen when an adult tells her to stop.\n\nRecently my younger son has gotten self conscious about his crooked teeth. So a few weeks ago I took him to an orthodontist to get braces. Paying for them in installments by the way.\n\nMy sister is absolutely pissed that I am paying for braces for his crooked teeth, but won\u2019t pay for her daughter\u2019s teeth. My sister was able to save up to get her daughter the partial denture, but she is old enough now to get implants and wants them because she is self conscious about having dentures. My sister says I should have started paying for her daughters implants first before I started paying for my sons braces because her daughter\u2019s teeth are way more messed up.", "created_utc": 1675960888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xzb0r/aita_for_getting_braces_for_my_son_and_not_paying/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Often times, they will do these types of treatments at a tremendously discounted price.

Now, I don't know how old your niece was at the time, I'm assuming older than 6 due to having some adult teeth and baby teeth, so she might have been in that \"I'm invincible\" stage that all children go through. She still should have listened to you and I feel for her because she was in elementary school and children can be cruel about any kind of problem other kids have. She's learning that with age, comes wisdom.

She didn't make a savings account and put in like $50 a month or anything?? It's more her problem that her kid didn't listen and she doesn't have adequate insurance. If she really doesn't have any money, she could have at least gotten governmental insurance through Medicaid (If US Based). Not the best, but it covers a lot if you find the right dentist. If she really cared about her daughters teeth, there's like a dozen things that take minimal effort for her to prepare over the past years for this expense.", "NTA. If your niece is old enough to have her adult teeth, she's old enough to know not to pull a dumb trick like that. Is your sister claiming she would've been able to intervene in a way you didn't? If not, I doubt this situation would've been different if your sister was watching her, and then she'd have no one to blame but herself.", "NTA, sounds like there has been enough time for your sister to get her life figured out and back on track.  Your niece is her responsibility.  Next, you did not encourage or force her to engage in risky behavior that subsequently got her teeth damaged.

You were also doing her a favor. You were not a paid child care provider. Accidents happen, this was not your fault.

I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve turned it into a teachable moment nor trotted out all the ways their mother couldn\u2019t pay for it.
