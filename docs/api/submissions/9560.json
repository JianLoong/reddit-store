So, I told them to stop because they might get hurt. My son stopped right away. My niece on the other hand refused and immediately she fell and totally ate it on the curb. Her face was all bloody and she had knocked out/chipped several front teeth. I called my sister and she told me to take her daughter to their dentist and she would meet us there.\n\nSince they were adult teeth the dentist put back in the two that got knocked out, but they didn\u2019t heal or something and fell out later.

I didn\u2019t think it was my responsibility to pay because her daughter decided to do something stupid. My sister insisted since I was watching her it was my responsibility to get her to stop. But there was literally no way I could have stopped her.

My sister was able to save up to get her daughter the partial denture, but she is old enough now to get implants and wants them because she is self conscious about having dentures.

What part of babysitting is this??\n\nIf you\u2019re watching a child, you are responsible for what happens to them. It\u2019s literally their liability and honestly I cannot believe people with children are ok with possible injuries to their kids. \n\nIt\u2019s actually a legal precedent that parents have sued for failure to provide adequate supervision..doesn\u2019t matter where they are. It\u2019s the adult who accepted the responsibility of watching the child.", "Let me break it down for you.\n\nThe person who should pay is the person who is most responsible, based on adding everything together--the factors that weigh for the OP being responsible vs the factors that weigh for the sister being responsible.\n\nOn one hand, the OP was watching her niece. She was standing in place of the niece's mother. This gives her a certain level of responsibility and it's not a small one. It happened on her watch. On the other hand, the injury was accidental due to the child's own lack of discipline. That's a matter of how her mother raised her. And furthermore, she was playing with a piece of sporting equipment known to lead to injury if not used with care, which her mother, not the OP, purchased for her. The balance of fault leans slightly against the OP's sister rather than the OP.\n\nI would be happy to clarify further.", "Nieces teeth won't drift if she keeps up with her partial denture. She can wear one until she herself is old enough to put down that kinda money. And she'd need the partial anyways to cover the implants while they heal.", "Almost all do, correct. Medicaid in some states even has denture budgets that don't touch the regular allotment per year.", "I would think she probably would have had renters insurance since she rents, not homeowners insurance.", "Well since it happened on public property no HO policy comes into play here but no homeowners policy or rental policy covers injuries to the occupants of the property only to non- residents when there is liability.", "Chill out!", "Sorry disagree. To be liable you have to be negligent in some way. Kids can get injured playing ball or riding a bike, playing on a swing set or many other activities. \nThe OP\u2019s own sister (niece\u2019s mother) was watching her child skateboard and left her child skateboarding-she was ok with this activity unfortunately her daughter fell off skate board, no different than if she fell off a bicycle. She got injured, which happens but OP did nothing wrong. The OP provided the same level of care that her sister provided before she left to run errands. It likely would have happened even if her sister never left. It was a accident. \nNegligent supervision doesn\u2019t apply since the OP was providing the same level of care as her sister which is all that is owed in this situation", "You chill the hell out. I didn't ask anyone to come yelling at me for an opinion.", "You can disagree however the only thing that needs to be proven for liability is negligence of supervision. \n\nOp says \u201ceventually I notice they are trying to do a dangerous trick\u201d.\n\nEventually implies that she wasn\u2019t paying attention to them. She looked up from whatever she was doing and noticed. What exactly was she doing that she \u201ceventually noticed\u201d.?\n\nPay attention if you\u2019re going to watch kids", "NTA.\n\nKids fall off bikes. Kids fall off skateboards. Shit happens.\n\nYou were not being a negligent caregiver and you told them to stop.\n\nHer child disobeyed you and consequently got hurt. \n\nAlso don't watch your sisters kid(s) again. Unless you purchase liability insurance. :-)", "NTA - you are not responsible for the cause and effect of the roughhouse. You told your niece and son it was dangerous, they continued doing it, she got hurt. If it was your kid you would have availed yourself of whatever options you could afford and do. \n\nYou are not financially responsible for other people's kids, and in this case it sounds like your sister is more salty that you have the available funds, or have prioritized spending those funds (payment plan or outright) on braces for you son, and it is something that sadly she has not been able to do. \n\nI don't know how often you talk or hang out with your sister but I would suggest not really brining up dental items and/or anything really relating to how you spend your money as this seems to still be a sore spot for her.", "NTA\n\nI had three adult front teeth knocked into my throat by a softball when I was 9 yrs old and staying with my aunt and uncle. They were able to put my teeth back in place with surgery and stitches and I had 3 root canals and extensive dental work for months after. My parents never once asked my aunt and uncle paying for anything.", "NTA. When I was younger I tripped over my aunts cat in her house and chose to fall into the door knob rather than fall on / hurt her elderly cat. Chipped both my front teeth, it was very obvious and we got it fixed ASAP.\n\nIt was not the cat\u2019s fault, my aunt\u2019s or even mine. Shit happens, you deal with it. It sucks that she can\u2019t afford it but if she had been putting money away from the time of incident and treated it like a payment plan, she probably could\u2019ve afforded it by now", "NTA.", "NTA. Not your kid, not your problem.", "My cousin was the same way, he chipped his front tooth. Then a few weeks after getting it fixed he decided that it was a good idea to bounce a bowling ball on his bed while standing above it facing down. It bounced up hit him in the face and chipped the same tooth, his parents let it stay that way for a couple of months before fixing it again. This was their way of letting him learn a lesson, that they pay for things but don't always have to fix them when he messes up. Her daughter is learning about listening when an adult tells you to stop for any reason.\n\nNTA", "OP said that they were too far away to physically stop them. She was on her way over when the girl decided to try the trick again and fell. It's a crappy situation, but OP did all they could do in the moment", "In that case, YTA. 10 year olds are still pretty young. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t listen to me\u201d isn\u2019t good enough. You were the adult in charge. You should have walked over and stopped her. This isn\u2019t a 15 year old who has carte Blanche to run around without parent permission. This is still an elementary age child. \n\nYou should pay for her teeth. You are responsible.", "No need to swear at me and the only one yelling is you."]}
