She wasn\u2019t sure exactly what she was going through, but realized she never had interest in boys. We spoke, she later determined on her own, she is a lesbian. She asked me not to tell anyone, I respected her wishes and wanted her to feel completely in control. \n\nFast forward to now, she\u2019s 15 and in a relationship which I was the only one in the family that knew. She determined recently it was her time to come out. Just after doing so I immediately sat my wife down to discuss the issue with her parents. I\u2019d prefer if we could all act as if they fell off the face of the earth, but that\u2019s not going to happen. She is very different from them, they don\u2019t see eye to eye on much. However, my wife is very open and tells all. I love her honesty, and she really is the best communicator I know. \n\nThat comes with drawback though. Part of the reason our daughter asked me to keep this a secret until she was ready, well that was because of her mom. We knew by telling her, she would make a huge announcement to the family, Facebook and probably put it on a billboard (kidding). My wife agreed not to tell her parents seeing that they would cause our daughter pain based on how they are full of hatred towards anyone that doesn\u2019t fit in their shoebox. To my utter shock, they don\u2019t know a thing as even my wife\u2019s sisters know but haven\u2019t told them either. \n\nHowever, my wife is very upset I had gone 3 years keeping this secret from her. She\u2019s not upset with our kid, but with me. She says only dysfunctional families keep secrets from each other. She feels like an outcast, as if my daughter and I have a relationship that doesn\u2019t involve her. She feels her honesty all these years have led to her being disrespected and disregarded. Her behavior has made our child feel bad, that\u2019s the last thing I wanted. \n\nI\u2019ll admit though, I did feel like I was hiding something every time I drove my daughter and her girlfriend on a date. Referring to her only in front of my wife as the friend and not the girlfriend also seemed wrong to me. Nonetheless, this is what my daughter wanted. She wanted to come out on her own terms, she wasn\u2019t ready for everyone to know. Had I told my wife and she let it out, my daughter would have never trusted me again. I feel like I did right by my daughter, but not by my wife.

You don't out people without their permission, period.

That\u2019s the most important reason for anything.

But I'm so sorry you found yourself in such a difficult position. Also understand why your wife is upset and hurt - but it's so unfortunate that she's upset with you when it was your daughter's decision not to trust her with deeply personal information. I'm not saying she shoud be upset with your daughter either - but the dynamic that made your daughter cautious about sharing with your wife starts with her and how your daughter sees her. If a family counselling session is an option, it might take these conversations in a better direction.", "Nah. Your wife is hurt and that is valid, you respected your daughter's wishes and that is also valid.", "This is truly the best reason to keep a secret. The fact that it is your wife is not relevant in this case. NTA", "NTA. It simply wasn\u2019t your secret to tell. I can understand why your wife is a little sad, but you still did the right thing", "Your daughter is at an age when respecting her privacy is CRUCIAL to having a good relationship with her. This secret was not harmful to anyone, so it wasn\u2019t something you absolutely should\u2019ve told your spouse. You did a huge chunk worth of parental work by keeping your word. Congrats, you proved to your daughter that you deserve her trust! NTA", "NTA. It wasn't your secret to tell. This information wasn't injuring anyone. Yes, your partner may need to redirect anger at you for not being selected but you are not wrong here. Otherwise you'd lose your developing bond and trust with your daughter", "NTA\nI agree, it wasn\u2019t your secret to tell. \n\nYour wife is now realizing that her idea of honesty is telling everyone everything and that now that she sees the flip side of it, she will change her ways. This is a good thing. \n\nShe should let your d know that she realizes why d wouldn\u2019t tell her and that now that she sees the repercussions of her flawed strategy she will respect whatever d chooses to share with her. \n\nThis could turn out to be a good thing.", "NTA \nYou did the right thing. It's never your job to out other people.", "NTA. Your child is allowed to keep information to herself or limited to chosen trusted individuals. It\u2019s really sad that she knew your wife wouldn\u2019t keep her \u2018secret\u2019 until she was ready. The potential damage to your daughter was more important than your wife\u2019s wants in this case.\n\nIf your wife can\u2019t keep others\u2019 secrets, that\u2019s not a \u2018good communicator\u2019, that\u2019s a blabbermouth - therefore keeping information from her is a necessity. She needs to build others\u2019 trust in her ability to keep quiet when asked.", "NTA - you made a promise to your daughter to keep her confidence.  You kept your promise.  There are some issues that require breaking a confidence for the safety of those involved but this wasn't one of those cases, in fact the opposite.  You were also protecting your wife from having to keep secrets from her parents.", "NTA.\n\nYou were in a somewhat uncomfortable position needing to keep that from your wife, sure. However you would have really been TA had you betrayed your daughter's trust. Does your wife think it's okay to betray people's trust?", "Going to say NAH\n\nYou did the right thing by your daughter- hands down. You get father of the year seriously!\n\nYour wife has a right to feel hurt- but her anger towards you is inappropriate. You alluded to the fact that she's an excellent communicator and her parents may not be accepting. It sucks that your daughter didn't trust her mother at first but maybe this is an opportunity for your wife to show that while she is great at communicating she knows when she shouldn't.", "NTA your daughter wasn't ready to tell her, if you told her you would have been betraying your daughters trust and forcing her to come out before she is ready. Remind your wife that somethings are not about her and your daughter was not ready for her to know, it's that simple.", "NTA.\n\nYour child came to you with a secret. A secret that would hurt no one and was hers to share when she was ready. You supported her in that despite that it was probably awful to not be able to speak to your wife about it.\nHad you had told your wife, even if she said nothing, you would have been breaking your daughters trust and you can\u2019t get that back. \n\nI am assuming you encouraged your daughter to be honest with her mom, but all in all this is kick ass parenting. \n\nGood job!", "It put you in a bad situation, but it wasn't your secret to reveal. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou should be proud that your daughter trusted you and you honoured that.\n\nNot many teenagers have that relationship.", "I'm sorry your wife is feeling hurt about this, however I am grateful your daughter could confide in you.  Over the years I figured out the relationship our daughter has with her dad is much different than the one she has with me.  It's not because she loves me or trusts me any less than him, but because of who he is to her if that makes any sense.  I get to handle some of the more emotional touchy subjects with her while she's more open with him on other topics concerning her future goals and plans.  Likely cuz I'm the realist and my hubs is a dreamer like her?  I am more cautious and he's more let me help you get it done lol.\n\nHowever you do owe your wife an apology for not trusting her enough to keep it from the toxic side of the family.  And as  you now know you really should have.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter had the right to decide if she trusted her mom as a safe person to come out to. She decided to tell you and asked you to not tell anyone.\n\nYou would have been an AH to violate her confidence. Your wife is being selfish and entitled trying to make it about herself.\n\nFrankly, her reaction seems to be proving the point", "NAH. O would of done the same thing if I were you!! It wasn\u2019t your secret to tell and you did absolutely right by your daughter! But I see your wife\u2019s point and feelings as well! Try to put yourself in her shoes and if you didn\u2019t know for the last 3 years she was hiding a big secret about your child. She\u2019s valid in how she feels as well!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was your daughter's secret, not yours.", "NTA- it sounds like your daughter had a good reason to not tell her mom until now. Even if she would have been supportive, that doesn't mean your daughter wants her to start announcing it to everyone, especially people who she knows will react badly. It's hard keeping secrets from a spouse and I understand why she might feel hurt, but she needs to understand that it is not your place to tell this kind of secret. Outing someone without their consent is extremely harmful, and if you had told your wife it would have, at the very least, severely harmed your relationship with your daughter. She saw you as someone she could trust, and by keeping her secret until she was ready to tell people you have shown she was right to have that trust in you. I think it would be helpful for you all to sit down, possibly with a family therapist, and discuss why your daughter felt the need to hide this from her mom. A therapist who is experienced with LGBTQ issues could be especially helpful in explaining why people choose to hide their sexuality for long periods. It is usually to avoid judgement or harm. And your wife making announcements without your daughter being ready would have been harmful. Your wife can explain that she feels hurt by this decision, but there should not be any blame put on your daughter. Your wife is hurt, and that is valid. However your daughter is also valid in keeping this secret until she was comfortable. Her sexuality is not anyone's business but her own, and anyone she chooses to share it with. Your wife needs to understand that it was her own actions which caused your daughter to feel she was not a safe person to come out to until now. Essentially her past actions showed that she is not someone to trust with a secret. If someone can't keep a secret, then telling them something is basically telling everyone. Even if your daughter wanted to tell her mom, she didn't want everyone else to know. And she probably felt there was no way to keep your wife from telling people.", "NTA. It was never your place to tell anyone. Your daughter trusted you and wasn't ready to come out to anyone else. You may have been keeping the secret from your wife but you were respecting your daughter's boundaries. Your wife will hopefully come to realize that it was never your secret to share.", "NTA\n\nI had a similar thing happen when my son came out to me but wasn't ready to come out to his dad/my husband. \n\nIt only lasted about two months till he did a dramatic come out on insta. At which point he had a conversation with his dad. \n\nThose were such a difficult two months for me, I can't imagine what you went through keeping that for three years. But that was the correct decision. \n\nThere are times when being a good parent conflicts with the idea of being a good spouse. As much as I don't have secrets in my relationship, this was not my secret to tell. It was my son's. \n\nYou were not withholding crucial information about yourself or your relationship. You were keeping the confidence of your daughter. \n\nYour wife probably feels guilty that her daughter did not feel comfortable confiding in her. I'm sure that hurts.  Instead of looking inward for the reason and adjusting, she is looking for someone to blame.", "You were in a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation.\n\n I think you are your daughter's hero. I think it is awesome that you kept your daughter's confidences. BUT on the other hand you and your daughter purposely lied and deceived your wife for 3 years! It is one thing to keep a secret by not sharing everything with a spouse when it it is not your secret to share. It is totally another thing to lie and deceive  for 3 years to your spouse. You earned your daughter's trust but at the same time you destroyed your wife's trust in you. The secret itself is not the issue. The lies and deception to your spouse are. Once trust is broken, the reason does not matter, it is not so easy to regain trust. You  value your daughter and her trust as it should be but you and your daughter obviously do not value your wife or her trust in you. You allowed a third person to come between you and your wife. It doesn't matter that is was on your daughter's behalf. If you could so easily lie and deceive your wife for 3 years then what is stopping you from lying and deceiving her again in the future about something else? How does your wife ever trust you again?\n\n Kudos for understanding the father/daughter dynamic. You suck at understanding how trust is supposed to work in a marriage and you may have totally nuked your marriage.\n\nNTA in regards to keeping your daughter's secret. Definitely TA to your wife.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think you were wrong to keep it a secret but I do think you were wrong In not encouraging your daughter to talk to her mom and to come out to her. Keeping your daughters secret was not wrong at all but honestly as a partner you looked straight in her face for three years and lied. Anyone would have issues with this and personally I would wonder what else could he be lying about to me. Your wife\u2019s feelings are valid as well because how you would you have felt if your wife lied to you for three years about something like this? Wouldn\u2019t that hurt you and make you feel like shit because the person you love has been lying to you and even if it\u2019s for a valid reason that\u2019s still a hard pain to deal with and then everything is just supposed to be ok and fine because you were keeping your daughters secret safe? You lied to your wife for three years and she never suspected a thing and now she has learned her husband who she loved and thought would not break her trust has done just that. It\u2019s about trust and it\u2019s hard to trust someone when you find out they have lied and you have done it for three years. \nTo me no one in this situation is an ass. \nYour daughter has a right to come out when and to who she wants.\nYou have a right to keep your daughters secret safe and make sure she is ok. \nYour wife has a right to feel hurt and anger at being lied to for three years. \nNow this is just based off what you have written. Humans are very complex and there are alot of nuances and dynamics that I do not know about as I don\u2019t know anyone involved. So my opinions and thoughts could change based on new info. I also don\u2019t know anyone else\u2019s brain and can only assume based on how I would feel about a situation and personally once someone has broken my trust I find it hard to believe them anymore because how am I supposed to know if they are lying or not. I think the best advice is to sit your wife down and have an open and honest conversation and say look while i understand your hurt and that your feelings about being hurt are valid and I\u2019m sorry my keeping it from you hurt you as that was not my intention but I am not sorry for keeping our daughters secret. She has a right to come out when and to who she feels ready to and at the time she wasn\u2019t ready to tell you and I wasn\u2019t going to go against her and Betray her trust. I am sorry that this has hurt you as well as maybe I should have tried harder to encourage her to tell you after a couple months. Something along those lines and then if she still can\u2019t get over it then it\u2019s on here. I don\u2019t agree with the comment about only dysfunctional families keep secrets but she might not believe that herself and maybe just said it in the heat of the moment. I do not know but I definitely think an open and honest conversation needs to be had and both of you need to explain your actions/reactions and why they happened. I don\u2019t know if you both have had a conversation or if it\u2019s just been passing remarks or if you explained yourself to your wife already. I hope this helps in some way. Sometimes there is no assholes in a situations cause either way you would have hurt someone but you choose correctly because if I was in your wife\u2019s position I would be happy you kept the secret and helped her but I would still feel very hurt and angry at being lied to and wouldn\u2019t know if I could continue in a relationship with someone I wasn\u2019t sure I could trust again but I have big trust issues from being abandoned and lied to alot through my life so my experiences have shaped and changed how I view lying and it would also depend on how my husband went about things when it all came out and if he felt remorse or if he didn\u2019t understand why I felt hurt. But I also have adhd and rsd ( rejection sensitive dysphoria) which I feel greatly effects how I see things like this as for me I would feel like absolute garbage for not only being lied to but also because my daughter and my husband both felt I couldn\u2019t be trusted with something like this and I would feel like a horrible mother and wife. I want to reiterate that her feelings while valid are not your or your daughter\u2019s responsibility. You did nothing wrong and neither did your daughter. Also want to add that sometimes people turn sadness and hurt into anger instead because it\u2019s easier to be angry than it is to feel sad", "YTA.  While it was ok to simply keep a secret, you went beyond that.  You actively lied to and deceived your wife for 3 years while you facilitated your daughter's dating habits.  That was wrong.  You should have told your daughter that you wouldn't tell her secret, but you also wouldn't help her go behind your wife's back for things.\n\nYou could have used this as a teaching lesson for your daughter in how a good spouse behaves.  Instead you chose to be a bad husband and not-that-great dad.", "NAH\n\nYou were being a good father, and you did great\n\nBut your wife is in here right to be pissed, the man she loves and her own daughter kind of excluded her for 3 years (For goods reason yes, but still)\n\nI think it's the kind of moment you accept that the best choice, what you did, wasn't a good choice, because sometimes, there's just no good choice\n\nAsk your wife forgiveness and by how you described it, she'll understand\n\nYou have to take the hit for the family dude", "NAH. \n\nYour wife is justified in her hurt. You also were right to respect your daughter\u2019s decision.  I hope your daughter has communicated to her mother how strongly she felt that you not say anything, that she asked you and you\u2019re grateful you respected her decision. \n\nI know she\u2019s a kid. But she asked you to risk the trust between you and your wife. She now needs to be part of fixing that.", "NAH. How do you expect your wife NOT to be upset with you, really? I hope you encouraged your daughter to trust her mother multiple times and ways. That was your responsibility in this.", "NAH. Everyone is entitled to their feelings here. If I were you, I would've made the same choice. And I would've made it with the understanding that it might upset my wife one day. But those are my values. I'm sure you didn't intentionally hurt your wife, and it sounds like you have considered over the years how she might feel to be left out, then ultimately chose to keep your daughter's confidence. As your daughter ages, you'll see how valuable that choice becomes to your relationship with her (spoiler alert: very!)\n\nYour wife might want to take a look at why your daughter didn't want her to know. And she's wrong that only dysfunctional families keep secrets. I'd argue that healthy families have healthy boundaries, and that includes respecting reach other's boundaries and the ability to have privacy and share things in your own time.\n\nFor your part, you've made a choice that helped your daughter but hurt your wife. You should ask what she wants from you here. An apology? A promise to never do it again? And then you can decide if that's something you're willing to do to make it up to her.", ">She is very different from them, they don\u2019t see eye to eye on much.

How could that conversation possibly end without her being outed? \n\nI mean, what's mom's _first_ question going to be? \"Oh wow, our little girl is dating!

They tell me things that they don't tell my husband, and tell him things that they don't tell me. Not because of differences in trust but differences in interests. Oddly enough people are individuals and have relationships with other individuals on different basis, due to hobbies, interests and trust levels. \n\nAlso 100% A+ dadding for keeping your daughters secret for her, you have proven to her that she can tell you anything in confidence and you will respect that, not judge her and have her back. NTA", "NTA \n\nIt's not your place to out someone, even if you know they will react positively. \nI do understand why your wife felt left out but it wasn't out of malice. But does she not see that sharing your daughter's secret against her wishes could cause your daughter to feel disrespected and disregarded too?", "You and your wife do have your own independent relationships with your daughter. She\u2019s unreasonable to expect any different", "NTA.... your daughter knows she can trust you with anything.... as an lbgt myself who couldn't come out to my mom... just because of the era she was raised in....( and I really didn't want her family weighing in, which when I did, my mama said fuck off, love her) not because I thought she would not handle correctly.... and when I did she just said I shit you not\"duh dumbass\".... having a person who screams everything to everyone.... not good. You held her trust. You loved her that much. Mom can get over it as its not about her. You did great! Keep doing it! Forever please...", "NTA. Your wife is understandably upset, but I think you did the right thing by your child.", "NTA. You're a good father. Your daughter was able to confide in you, and you were able to maintain her trust by keeping her secret. When and how she comes out should always be her choice, and sometimes that means telling certain people at certain times.", "NTA. You DO have a relationship with your daughter that has nothing to do with her (father/daughter), same as your wife a relationship with her that has nothing to do with you (mother/daughter). This was a secret that was not your business to divulge, and if you had, only would have led to your daughter distrusting both of you. It's not like she confided she was cutting or anorexic or something dangerous. \n\nAlso, the idea that no one is allowed to to have secrets in a \"healthy family\" is, in itself, a toxic idea ironically enough. People are allowed privacy. Some things shouldn't be secrets, sure, but fostering healthy boundaries and privacy is an important job of parents too, just as important as honesty and openness.", "NTA your daughter trusted you with a very important secret.  It wasn\u2019t your secret to share.  She came out to her mother when she was ready.  \nYou can all deal with her bigoted grandparents now if needed.  Hopefully your wife will get over her hurt feelings and see that you put your daughter\u2019s safety and well being first by keeping her secret until she was older and more ready to share.  Being \u201cout\u201d at 12/13 is very different from being \u201cout\u201d at 15.   And one should never be outed by someone else.", "Absolutely NTA. You did the right thing by respecting your daughter's wishes.\n\nI do totally understand why your wife is upset, but it wasn't your secret to tell. Period.", "NAH. If I was your wife, I'd be hurt and upset also, I can't say her feelings aren't valid. You two need to have a very serious discussion on this (your daughter really should have a discussion with her as well, separately ofc, because your marriage issues from this are not for her to see and she needs to have a private conversation with your wife as well so they can work through this) All that said, you did right by your daughter for not outing her, less so for anyone by the secret dates.", ">I\u2019ll admit though, I did feel like I was hiding something every time I drove my daughter and her girlfriend on a date.\n\nYou were hiding something. Did you ever discuss with your wife the appropriate age to let your daughter start dating? 12-14 is considered very young to start dating in many cultures. You just took that onto yourself.", "NTA.  The worst-case scenario for your wife not knowing your daughter's secret was her being upset at being left out of the loop.  The worst-case scenario for your daughter was being forcibly outed, which is far more consequential.  Upset can fade, you can't climb back in the closet once you've been outed.\n\nMaybe your wife should ask herself why her daughter didn't trust her to keep a vitally important secret, because I doubt this is the first unwanted announcement.", "NTA.\n\nYou just don't out someone without their approval, especially when you know the person you're telling it to is going to tell everyone.\n\nYour daughter trusted you with a secret and you proved you could keep it. Real dad right there, she's going to trust you moving forward. I wish I had had such a father. And the fact that she was the first and for a long time only one she trusted proves you've proven yourself many times before too.", "NTA. Your wife\u2019s long history of blasting other people\u2019s personal business to everyone she knows is the reason this was kept from her. Hopefully your wife learns a lesson from her daughter\u2019s distrust and stops broadcasting everyone\u2019s life for attention. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about \u201chonesty\u201d it\u2019s about your wife overstepping boundaries for attention from facebook friends, otherwise your daughter wouldn\u2019t have realized at TWELVE that your wife can\u2019t be trusted with secrets. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge red flag that at twelve years old your daughter recognized that her mom wouldn\u2019t respect her privacy. What\u2019s up with that?", "NTA, not your story to tell as your daughter wanted to control the information and disclose it when she was ready.", "NTA your daughter was the best person to make that decision. You wife maybe upset at herself and misplacing that anger on to you. This doesn\u2019t have to be a big blow up if your willling to accept this and take the hit but if you want you can point it out to your wife but it may cause more harm than good. Your daughter didn\u2019t see her as a safe space with her secret and if you told your wife then your daughter would have seen you as an unsafe space as well.", "This is a hard one. You've been a good father to your daughter, but a bad husband to your wife. If you can keep a secret like this - more so the fact that you played such an active role in helping your daughter date than just keeping her sexuality secret - for THREE years, what else can you keep hidden? If I were your wife, I'd have trouble trusting you.", "I wish my mom has this ounce of respect to me and my secrets like you with your daugther. I cannot tell her anything in confidence even now in my mid 30s because by the end of the day even the extended family will know. Your wife needs to understand there is something called boundaries and trust and if your daugther told your first instead of her...that's saying something. NTA", "INFO: What would your wife had done if your daughter told her and not you?\n\nGiven how your wife has handled this now, I think she would also have respected your daughter\u2019s wishes and not told you. \n\nRoundabout way of saying N-T-A.", "NTA good job, someone coming out to you in confidence is a secret you take to your grave if you have to", "NTA.  Once a child loses trust in their parent it is gone forever.  You are a wonderful father and have a daughter that loves you very  much.", "NTA \n\nYou and your daughter are allowed to have a relationship that doesn't include your wife. \n\nDaughter felt safe/comfortable to confide in you. Don't blow it now because your wife is guilt tripping you. Being an honest person doesn't mean you blab everyone's business.\n\nWhat your wife should be upset about is how she makes your daughter afraid to come to her with private sensitive information. Well, actually that's probably why she's upset and trying to make you feel guilty.", "NTA. Your daughters trust in you has been proven solid. That's what's most important.  It wasn't your secret to tell. Good for you.\n\nBut i understand her mom is hurt that she couldn't be trusted with that secret. It means she needs to reflect on herself if her daughter felt she couldn't trust her with it. A painful reality to come to terms with.", "NTA.\n\nWhen I was 20, I came out to my mother as pansexual. I asked her to please allow me to bring it up with my father on my own time, because I was afraid of how he might take it. (Thankfully, fully supportive and loving.) When I came out to my father, he said he knew, because she told him before I could because \"family doesn't keep secrets.\" It felt like such a betrayal of my trust, and it still makes me wary of confiding sensitive information in others to this day, more than a decade later. I cannot imagine how much more it would have hurt to have that happen during my teenage years.\n\nYou did the right thing by your daughter, and if your wife brings it up, remind her that somebody's sexuality is their business and nobody else's. It is not up to you to divulge your daughter's sexuality to anyone, and she deserves the right to come out to others at her own pace. I empathize with your wife, but I think you made the right choice in this situation.", "NTA and you did the right thing. This was not your story to share but your daughters.\n\nShe has shared it and your wife needs to understand this. Your daughter felt safe knowing that she would not be outed until she decided she was ready", "It is difficult to keep a secret like that, but I think it is one of the most important things you will do as a parent. I've had to do the same thing, twice now, with my children. Both came out to me, around the same age as your daughter. Both asked me not to tell their father, not that he would have a problem with it. I kept the secrets until they were ready to share with other people, including their father. It is also up to them to share with other family. Hopefully your wife will come to understand the difficult position you and your daughter were in. You are an awesome and supportive parent. NTA. NAH", "Agreed. Our daughter came out to me first, at 14, and asked me not to tell her Dad until she was ready for him to know. When she realized her coming out made no difference in our relationship and I reassured her my husband would feel the same way, she gave me permission to tell him; in our case, the time difference was about 48 hours. No issues arose, ever. After I told him they went out for a bike ride and had a long talk by the river - without me. Our relationships with each other all have their different dynamics, something we all value as that makes different conversations possible. NTA, OP.", "Yo I'm a whole ass trans non binary with a new legal name and my mom doesn't know LOL", ">but it's so unfortunate that she's upset with you when it was your daughter's decision not to trust her with deeply personal information\n\nI bet a dime to a dollar she was more upset because her husband was sneaking her 12-14 year old daughter out to dates than keeping her orientation a secret. Imagine if you had a 13 year old daughter and your husband was sneaking her out on dates without even discussing if going on dates at that age was appropriate. You'd probably be furious, no matter the gender of her date.", "I have two parents who don't care about my privacy, and have overshared at every opportunity. I hate telling them anything even vaguely personal. I've had my father talking to my cousin in law about my genitals. In front of her kids.  \nI was so angry I snapped and threatened him.  \n  \nHonestly I don't tell them anything if I can help it. They can't be trusted at all.  \n  \nI absolutely would have loved to have a parent like OP who understood how to keep a secret. And I would do the same in his shoes. NTA", "Yes, this! OP\u2019s wife may feel hurt that her daughter didn\u2019t tell her right away, but I would try to focus on the fact that she did feel safe to tell OP. Some people don\u2019t feel that safety with anyone, which is just so sad.", "My dad is like OP. He's always been someone I can trust with anything. I love my mom, but nothing stays a secret with her. Your daughter needs someone she can wholeheartedly trust, and I could not be happier that that person for me is my dad. I love him so much. NTA.", "By the same token, the wife knows she can't trust her husband.  Forever.  That is also priceless.\n\nThis family is well-intentioned, but they need counseling to repair this relationship.", "Except that he was wrong.  She didn't overshare.  She kept the secret.\n\nAnd she knows that her husband can keep sexual secrets from her for years.\n\nThey need therapy.", "Don't understand your calm down comment. \n\nAs I mentioned I don't believe the issue is the secret itself. The lies and deception are the issue. There is nothing wrong with keeping the daughter's secret but lying to one's spouse for 3 years involves a lack of value and respect for the spouse. You don't treat people you care about that way.\n\nIn this situation the daughter is the third person. A marriage is between two individuals. A third person can be anyone you allow to come between you and your spouse whether it is your child, friend, parent, sibling, whoever. When that third person is the priority over your spouse and causes you to lie and deceive there is a problem.\n\nI didn't see any \"Woe is me\" story. I must have missed that comment.\n\nI don't understand your pointing a finger comment question about self reflection. Two wrongs don't make a right.  Even if someone is found not to be trust worthy that still doesn't make it right to betray their trust in you with lies and deceit. Not everyone has the same moral compass and integrity.\n\nAs I stated my opinion before, OP is NTA for keeping his daughter's secret. He is an TA for lying and deceiving his wife. You don't treat people you love and care about that way.", "I disagree. He could have, at any time over those three years, encouraged her to speak to her mom. That\u2019s not outing her. That\u2019s leveling with her about how she does have an awesome mom, and to consider ways to bring her into her life, especially since it sounds like her mom is supportive and loving.", "Why would you trust someone that would freely tell you other people's secrets? \n\nKeeping somebody's sexuality a secret from someone that they don't want to know that info isn't a breach of trust. It's integrity and respect.", "The wife can\u2019t be trusted with secrets. She casts it as openness and honesty, but only her own personal information is suitable for that \u201chonesty\u201d, not another\u2019s \u2014 and definitely not that of her minor child. I agree that they need family therapy, but this needs to include her doing some significant self-examination as to why her daughter couldn\u2019t trust her to keep private information private.", "If my child and husband don't trust me with their secrets, I would take a long look at myself.", "But he and a 12yo child already knew they couldn\u2019t trust her. So she brought this upon herself.", ">What is clear is that OP hid the specifics of active dating that was happening from his wife. Which I agree is not great, but in this situation he doesn't have any better alternatives than I can think of.\n\nYou completely left off option 5: \n\nTelling his (younger than 15) daughter \"Sorry, but I can't let you go on dates without your mother knowing, you're going to have to wait.\"\n\nKeeping her orientation a secret does not give him license to make that decision solo.", "She did keep it secret and they were surprised.  If the daughter wasn't sure that mom would keep a secret, then it's safe to say mom had overshared in the past.  You're right in the fact that some therapy, with the goal of open communication would benefit them.", "But she had a track record that indicated that she would overshare, and indeed was proud of being so open with everything. That\u2019s quite the risk to take with a twelve-year-old\u2019s personal secrets.", "He did gently support her, by letting her decide when and how to proceed.", "Also, keeping what was your daughter\u2019s personal secret is totally different than you creating secrets\ntogether that are kept from your wife.  You could have held her secret in confidence.  You both sneaking around behind her back is shitty.", "But it is not fair to ask your father to LIE to your mother for 3 years.  It wasn\u2019t just keeping a secret, it was actively lying.", "It's less about coming out, and more about taking her on secret dates for 3 years, starting at 12. A parent IS owed that information.", "Except that apparently she could be trusted with the secret - which is why the Grandparents don't know.\n\nOP may have been right to honor the original secret, but to have kept it for 3 years invalidates the trust of his marriage.  He made that choice.", "My partner and I are queer but we have seen queer households where coming out is such a big thing still that kids don't wanna tell because they're still exploring.\n\nSo we already agreed we 1000% keep the damn secret because its None of Our Business unless the kid tells us.\n\nI've had children of queer parents come out to me because they were panicked their parent would he SO EXCITED they couldn't just...

They need space and time, even in a welcoming household.\n\nI would be absolutely pissed and consider divorce if my partner outted one of our kids to me.", "Her behaviour didn\u2019t show she could be trusted with secrets.

And her previous attitude strongly indicated that she would tell.\n\nThey were wrong about whether she\u2019d tell her parents \u2014 though apparently she told others \u2014 but their expectation that she would likely tell had foundation, so it wasn\u2019t wrong of them to act accordingly.\n\nI agree that trust needs to be repaired, but from both sides. It must be terrible to find that everything you tell your spouse is at significant risk of being broadcast.", "It never occurred to me that a kid could worry even in a welcoming family, but it absolutely makes sense. I would have totally been that mom. I would want to be my son\u2019s wingman, and would drive him nuts :)", "Yeah in that situation I\u2019d have just lied and pretended my dates were just friends.", "Oh yeah it's sweet and in the right place, but even straight kids are hella embarrassed by their parents bringing up their crushes. Add in the queer factor and it becomes \"oh jesus if I tell mom she is totally buying me a five foot rainbow flag and I just want to see if Kelly likes me back\".  A lot of \"GEEZE MUM JUST LET ME LIVE\" in those households, so nothing out of the ordinary, but some queer parents can go over-board accepting and it becomes humiliating to the poor child.", "there was no possible way to tell his wife about what was going on without violating his daughter's trust and potentially putting her in danger, e.g. if wife accidentally lets it slip to her known homophobe parents. children's basic safety comes before adults' feelings, always.\n\ni said it in my main comment, but being outed as a child is an experience i wouldn't wish on the most vile person in the world. if i WASN'T lied to in that situation, and someone outed a child to me who'd come out to them privately, i would be mad as hell at them.", "Why does he have an obligation to tell someone else's secret to his wife?", "No. A parent has a duty to care for a child. Whilst there may exist such duty for spouses (and acting on such supposed duty would yeild superior marriage), it is miniscule/non-existent compared to a duty to a child.", "He has an obligation not to lie to his wife.", "Disagree", "Don\u2019t have children or get married. For the sake of the child. \nChildren trump spouses. Especially when they\u2019re minors in your care. I\u2019ve heard too many stories of parents who put their spouse/boyfriend/girlfriend above their child and it\u2019s ridiculous."]}
