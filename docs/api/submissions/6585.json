She wasn\u2019t sure exactly what she was going through, but realized she never had interest in boys. We spoke, she later determined on her own, she is a lesbian. She asked me not to tell anyone, I respected her wishes and wanted her to feel completely in control. \n\nFast forward to now, she\u2019s 15 and in a relationship which I was the only one in the family that knew. She determined recently it was her time to come out. Just after doing so I immediately sat my wife down to discuss the issue with her parents. I\u2019d prefer if we could all act as if they fell off the face of the earth, but that\u2019s not going to happen. She is very different from them, they don\u2019t see eye to eye on much. However, my wife is very open and tells all. I love her honesty, and she really is the best communicator I know. \n\nThat comes with drawback though. Part of the reason our daughter asked me to keep this a secret until she was ready, well that was because of her mom. We knew by telling her, she would make a huge announcement to the family, Facebook and probably put it on a billboard (kidding). My wife agreed not to tell her parents seeing that they would cause our daughter pain based on how they are full of hatred towards anyone that doesn\u2019t fit in their shoebox. To my utter shock, they don\u2019t know a thing as even my wife\u2019s sisters know but haven\u2019t told them either. \n\nHowever, my wife is very upset I had gone 3 years keeping this secret from her. She\u2019s not upset with our kid, but with me. She says only dysfunctional families keep secrets from each other. She feels like an outcast, as if my daughter and I have a relationship that doesn\u2019t involve her. She feels her honesty all these years have led to her being disrespected and disregarded. Her behavior has made our child feel bad, that\u2019s the last thing I wanted. \n\nI\u2019ll admit though, I did feel like I was hiding something every time I drove my daughter and her girlfriend on a date. Referring to her only in front of my wife as the friend and not the girlfriend also seemed wrong to me. Nonetheless, this is what my daughter wanted. She wanted to come out on her own terms, she wasn\u2019t ready for everyone to know. Had I told my wife and she let it out, my daughter would have never trusted me again. I feel like I did right by my daughter, but not by my wife.

You don't out people without their permission, period.

That\u2019s the most important reason for anything. She wasn\u2019t in danger and she knew that you were safe, destroying that, by telling your wife would have been 100x worse. \n\nYou are a great father!", "NTA. You had no choice. But I'm so sorry you found yourself in such a difficult position. Also understand why your wife is upset and hurt - but it's so unfortunate that she's upset with you when it was your daughter's decision not to trust her with deeply personal information. I'm not saying she shoud be upset with your daughter either - but the dynamic that made your daughter cautious about sharing with your wife starts with her and how your daughter sees her. If a family counselling session is an option, it might take these conversations in a better direction.", "Nah. Your wife is hurt and that is valid, you respected your daughter's wishes and that is also valid.", "This is truly the best reason to keep a secret. The fact that it is your wife is not relevant in this case. NTA", "NTA. It simply wasn\u2019t your secret to tell. I can understand why your wife is a little sad, but you still did the right thing", "Your daughter is at an age when respecting her privacy is CRUCIAL to having a good relationship with her. This secret was not harmful to anyone, so it wasn\u2019t something you absolutely should\u2019ve told your spouse. You did a huge chunk worth of parental work by keeping your word. Congrats, you proved to your daughter that you deserve her trust! NTA", "NTA. It wasn't your secret to tell. This information wasn't injuring anyone. Yes, your partner may need to redirect anger at you for not being selected but you are not wrong here. Otherwise you'd lose your developing bond and trust with your daughter", "NTA\nI agree, it wasn\u2019t your secret to tell. \n\nYour wife is now realizing that her idea of honesty is telling everyone everything and that now that she sees the flip side of it, she will change her ways. This is a good thing. \n\nShe should let your d know that she realizes why d wouldn\u2019t tell her and that now that she sees the repercussions of her flawed strategy she will respect whatever d chooses to share with her. \n\nThis could turn out to be a good thing.", "NTA \nYou did the right thing. It's never your job to out other people.", "NTA. Your child is allowed to keep information to herself or limited to chosen trusted individuals. It\u2019s really sad that she knew your wife wouldn\u2019t keep her \u2018secret\u2019 until she was ready. The potential damage to your daughter was more important than your wife\u2019s wants in this case.\n\nIf your wife can\u2019t keep others\u2019 secrets, that\u2019s not a \u2018good communicator\u2019, that\u2019s a blabbermouth - therefore keeping information from her is a necessity. She needs to build others\u2019 trust in her ability to keep quiet when asked.", "NTA - you made a promise to your daughter to keep her confidence.  You kept your promise.  There are some issues that require breaking a confidence for the safety of those involved but this wasn't one of those cases, in fact the opposite.  You were also protecting your wife from having to keep secrets from her parents.", "NTA.\n\nYou were in a somewhat uncomfortable position needing to keep that from your wife, sure. However you would have really been TA had you betrayed your daughter's trust. Does your wife think it's okay to betray people's trust?", "Going to say NAH\n\nYou did the right thing by your daughter- hands down. You get father of the year seriously!\n\nYour wife has a right to feel hurt- but her anger towards you is inappropriate. You alluded to the fact that she's an excellent communicator and her parents may not be accepting. It sucks that your daughter didn't trust her mother at first but maybe this is an opportunity for your wife to show that while she is great at communicating she knows when she shouldn't.", "NTA your daughter wasn't ready to tell her, if you told her you would have been betraying your daughters trust and forcing her to come out before she is ready. Remind your wife that somethings are not about her and your daughter was not ready for her to know, it's that simple.", "NTA.\n\nYour child came to you with a secret. A secret that would hurt no one and was hers to share when she was ready. You supported her in that despite that it was probably awful to not be able to speak to your wife about it.\nHad you had told your wife, even if she said nothing, you would have been breaking your daughters trust and you can\u2019t get that back. \n\nI am assuming you encouraged your daughter to be honest with her mom, but all in all this is kick ass parenting. \n\nGood job!", "It put you in a bad situation, but it wasn't your secret to reveal. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou should be proud that your daughter trusted you and you honoured that.\n\nNot many teenagers have that relationship.", "I'm sorry your wife is feeling hurt about this, however I am grateful your daughter could confide in you.  Over the years I figured out the relationship our daughter has with her dad is much different than the one she has with me.  It's not because she loves me or trusts me any less than him, but because of who he is to her if that makes any sense.  I get to handle some of the more emotional touchy subjects with her while she's more open with him on other topics concerning her future goals and plans.  Likely cuz I'm the realist and my hubs is a dreamer like her?  I am more cautious and he's more let me help you get it done lol.\n\nHowever you do owe your wife an apology for not trusting her enough to keep it from the toxic side of the family.  And as  you now know you really should have.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter had the right to decide if she trusted her mom as a safe person to come out to. She decided to tell you and asked you to not tell anyone.\n\nYou would have been an AH to violate her confidence. Your wife is being selfish and entitled trying to make it about herself.\n\nFrankly, her reaction seems to be proving the point", "NAH. O would of done the same thing if I were you!! It wasn\u2019t your secret to tell and you did absolutely right by your daughter! But I see your wife\u2019s point and feelings as well! Try to put yourself in her shoes and if you didn\u2019t know for the last 3 years she was hiding a big secret about your child. She\u2019s valid in how she feels as well!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was your daughter's secret, not yours.", "NTA- it sounds like your daughter had a good reason to not tell her mom until now. Even if she would have been supportive, that doesn't mean your daughter wants her to start announcing it to everyone, especially people who she knows will react badly. It's hard keeping secrets from a spouse and I understand why she might feel hurt, but she needs to understand that it is not your place to tell this kind of secret. Outing someone without their consent is extremely harmful, and if you had told your wife it would have, at the very least, severely harmed your relationship with your daughter. She saw you as someone she could trust, and by keeping her secret until she was ready to tell people you have shown she was right to have that trust in you. I think it would be helpful for you all to sit down, possibly with a family therapist, and discuss why your daughter felt the need to hide this from her mom. A therapist who is experienced with LGBTQ issues could be especially helpful in explaining why people choose to hide their sexuality for long periods. It is usually to avoid judgement or harm. And your wife making announcements without your daughter being ready would have been harmful. Your wife can explain that she feels hurt by this decision, but there should not be any blame put on your daughter. Your wife is hurt, and that is valid. However your daughter is also valid in keeping this secret until she was comfortable. Her sexuality is not anyone's business but her own, and anyone she chooses to share it with. Your wife needs to understand that it was her own actions which caused your daughter to feel she was not a safe person to come out to until now. Essentially her past actions showed that she is not someone to trust with a secret. If someone can't keep a secret, then telling them something is basically telling everyone. Even if your daughter wanted to tell her mom, she didn't want everyone else to know. And she probably felt there was no way to keep your wife from telling people.", "NTA. It was never your place to tell anyone. Your daughter trusted you and wasn't ready to come out to anyone else. You may have been keeping the secret from your wife but you were respecting your daughter's boundaries. Your wife will hopefully come to realize that it was never your secret to share.", "NTA\n\nI had a similar thing happen when my son came out to me but wasn't ready to come out to his dad/my husband. \n\nIt only lasted about two months till he did a dramatic come out on insta. At which point he had a conversation with his dad. \n\nThose were such a difficult two months for me, I can't imagine what you went through keeping that for three years. But that was the correct decision. \n\nThere are times when being a good parent conflicts with the idea of being a good spouse. As much as I don't have secrets in my relationship, this was not my secret to tell. It was my son's. \n\nYou were not withholding crucial information about yourself or your relationship. You were keeping the confidence of your daughter. \n\nYour wife probably feels guilty that her daughter did not feel comfortable confiding in her. I'm sure that hurts.  Instead of looking inward for the reason and adjusting, she is looking for someone to blame.", "You were in a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation.\n\n I think you are your daughter's hero. I think it is awesome that you kept your daughter's confidences. BUT on the other hand you and your daughter purposely lied and deceived your wife for 3 years! It is one thing to keep a secret by not sharing everything with a spouse when it it is not your secret to share. It is totally another thing to lie and deceive  for 3 years to your spouse. You earned your daughter's trust but at the same time you destroyed your wife's trust in you. The secret itself is not the issue. The lies and deception to your spouse are. Once trust is broken, the reason does not matter, it is not so easy to regain trust. You  value your daughter and her trust as it should be but you and your daughter obviously do not value your wife or her trust in you. You allowed a third person to come between you and your wife. It doesn't matter that is was on your daughter's behalf. If you could so easily lie and deceive your wife for 3 years then what is stopping you from lying and deceiving her again in the future about something else? How does your wife ever trust you again?\n\n Kudos for understanding the father/daughter dynamic. You suck at understanding how trust is supposed to work in a marriage and you may have totally nuked your marriage.\n\nNTA in regards to keeping your daughter's secret. Definitely TA to your wife.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think you were wrong to keep it a secret but I do think you were wrong In not encouraging your daughter to talk to her mom and to come out to her. Keeping your daughters secret was not wrong at all but honestly as a partner you looked straight in her face for three years and lied. Anyone would have issues with this and personally I would wonder what else could he be lying about to me. Your wife\u2019s feelings are valid as well because how you would you have felt if your wife lied to you for three years about something like this? Wouldn\u2019t that hurt you and make you feel like shit because the person you love has been lying to you and even if it\u2019s for a valid reason that\u2019s still a hard pain to deal with and then everything is just supposed to be ok and fine because you were keeping your daughters secret safe? You lied to your wife for three years and she never suspected a thing and now she has learned her husband who she loved and thought would not break her trust has done just that. It\u2019s about trust and it\u2019s hard to trust someone when you find out they have lied and you have done it for three years. \nTo me no one in this situation is an ass. \nYour daughter has a right to come out when and to who she wants.\nYou have a right to keep your daughters secret safe and make sure she is ok. \nYour wife has a right to feel hurt and anger at being lied to for three years. \nNow this is just based off what you have written. Humans are very complex and there are alot of nuances and dynamics that I do not know about as I don\u2019t know anyone involved. So my opinions and thoughts could change based on new info. I also don\u2019t know anyone else\u2019s brain and can only assume based on how I would feel about a situation and personally once someone has broken my trust I find it hard to believe them anymore because how am I supposed to know if they are lying or not. I think the best advice is to sit your wife down and have an open and honest conversation and say look while i understand your hurt and that your feelings about being hurt are valid and I\u2019m sorry my keeping it from you hurt you as that was not my intention but I am not sorry for keeping our daughters secret. She has a right to come out when and to who she feels ready to and at the time she wasn\u2019t ready to tell you and I wasn\u2019t going to go against her and Betray her trust. I am sorry that this has hurt you as well as maybe I should have tried harder to encourage her to tell you after a couple months. Something along those lines and then if she still can\u2019t get over it then it\u2019s on here. I don\u2019t agree with the comment about only dysfunctional families keep secrets but she might not believe that herself and maybe just said it in the heat of the moment. I do not know but I definitely think an open and honest conversation needs to be had and both of you need to explain your actions/reactions and why they happened. I don\u2019t know if you both have had a conversation or if it\u2019s just been passing remarks or if you explained yourself to your wife already. I hope this helps in some way. Sometimes there is no assholes in a situations cause either way you would have hurt someone but you choose correctly because if I was in your wife\u2019s position I would be happy you kept the secret and helped her but I would still feel very hurt and angry at being lied to and wouldn\u2019t know if I could continue in a relationship with someone I wasn\u2019t sure I could trust again but I have big trust issues from being abandoned and lied to alot through my life so my experiences have shaped and changed how I view lying and it would also depend on how my husband went about things when it all came out and if he felt remorse or if he didn\u2019t understand why I felt hurt. But I also have adhd and rsd ( rejection sensitive dysphoria) which I feel greatly effects how I see things like this as for me I would feel like absolute garbage for not only being lied to but also because my daughter and my husband both felt I couldn\u2019t be trusted with something like this and I would feel like a horrible mother and wife. I want to reiterate that her feelings while valid are not your or your daughter\u2019s responsibility. You did nothing wrong and neither did your daughter. Also want to add that sometimes people turn sadness and hurt into anger instead because it\u2019s easier to be angry than it is to feel sad", "YTA.  While it was ok to simply keep a secret, you went beyond that.  You actively lied to and deceived your wife for 3 years while you facilitated your daughter's dating habits.  That was wrong.  You should have told your daughter that you wouldn't tell her secret, but you also wouldn't help her go behind your wife's back for things.\n\nYou could have used this as a teaching lesson for your daughter in how a good spouse behaves.  Instead you chose to be a bad husband and not-that-great dad.", "NAH\n\nYou were being a good father, and you did great\n\nBut your wife is in here right to be pissed, the man she loves and her own daughter kind of excluded her for 3 years (For goods reason yes, but still)\n\nI think it's the kind of moment you accept that the best choice, what you did, wasn't a good choice, because sometimes, there's just no good choice\n\nAsk your wife forgiveness and by how you described it, she'll understand\n\nYou have to take the hit for the family dude", "NAH. \n\nYour wife is justified in her hurt. You also were right to respect your daughter\u2019s decision.  I hope your daughter has communicated to her mother how strongly she felt that you not say anything, that she asked you and you\u2019re grateful you respected her decision. \n\nI know she\u2019s a kid. But she asked you to risk the trust between you and your wife. She now needs to be part of fixing that.", "NAH. How do you expect your wife NOT to be upset with you, really? I hope you encouraged your daughter to trust her mother multiple times and ways. That was your responsibility in this.", "NAH. Everyone is entitled to their feelings here. If I were you, I would've made the same choice. And I would've made it with the understanding that it might upset my wife one day. But those are my values. I'm sure you didn't intentionally hurt your wife, and it sounds like you have considered over the years how she might feel to be left out, then ultimately chose to keep your daughter's confidence. As your daughter ages, you'll see how valuable that choice becomes to your relationship with her (spoiler alert: very!)\n\nYour wife might want to take a look at why your daughter didn't want her to know. And she's wrong that only dysfunctional families keep secrets. I'd argue that healthy families have healthy boundaries, and that includes respecting reach other's boundaries and the ability to have privacy and share things in your own time.\n\nFor your part, you've made a choice that helped your daughter but hurt your wife. You should ask what she wants from you here. An apology? A promise to never do it again? And then you can decide if that's something you're willing to do to make it up to her.", ">She is very different from them, they don\u2019t see eye to eye on much.

How could that conversation possibly end without her being outed? \n\nI mean, what's mom's _first_ question going to be? \"Oh wow, our little girl is dating!

I don't think none queer people understand how hard it can be to come to term with your sexuality even for me and i grew up in a liberal home where my mom always explicitly said she wouldn't care if one of her kids were gay. I ended up coming out to the rest of my immediate family when i was 16 because i had grown into myself and become comfortable in my own skin but i was still too nervous to do it in person so i texted everybody at 3 a.m.. Everyone was accepting of course but it was terrifying. I love my mom more than anything in this world but i don't think i would have ever been able to forgive her if she had outed me at 12 years old when i was scared and needed a parent to comfort and protect me. \n\nSo long way to say you are NTA in anyway in my eyes", "NAH\n\nHowever I do think that when things went from feelings to actions, you should have encouraged your daughter to share with her mother. \n\nKeeping a confidence is different than being an active participant in deception.", "I did not come out to my mother for a while for the same reason: that once she knew, so would everyone as she's a gossip with the family.\n\nIt's unfair of your wife to be mad at you when you were put in an awkward place.

Not who her daughter is dating, just the fact that she is going on dates and kissing people or whatever. That\u2019s not about her feelings, it\u2019s about her rights as a parent.\n\nWhat if she didn\u2019t want her daughter to start dating until she 15? What if she didn\u2019t want her daughter dating without having a conversation about safety and giving her specific tips from a woman\u2019s perspective? What if a million other things she has a right to want as a mom. \n\nThe child felt unsafe telling her mother, but it\u2019s obvious that didn\u2019t last forever. She was capable of waiting 3 years to start dating, and if I\u2019m honest, 12 is already too early to start dating. That\u2019s the 7th grade. OP should have waited before unilaterally giving his daughter permission to start dating.", "I\u2019m not arguing for forced outing. He could simply have told his daughter she wasn\u2019t allowed to date. OP is absolutely not just allowed to unilaterally make that decision for his daughter. Besides, by driving her to dates, he essentially encouraged the behavior. There\u2019s a wide gap between \u201cI told you not to date and you did it anyway and now you\u2019re grounded,\u201d and \u201cI know you\u2019ll ignore me if I try to parent you, so I just won\u2019t parent you at all and you can do what you want.\u201d \n\nIf she was straight, the mother would be involved in the decision to let the daughter start dating, so she equally has a right to be involved if the daughter is gay. If she wasn\u2019t ready to come out to her mother, she\u2019s not ready to start dating. \n\nBut you don\u2019t get to unilaterally shut your spouse out of a decision they expected to be a part of and then argue your way out of it.\n\nEdit: what if the daughter wanted a pride flag tattoo at age 14. Would OP be justified in taking her to get the tattoo without telling his wife? Or would you agree she should wait on the tattoo until 1) she\u2019s 16 at least and it\u2019s reasonable for her to make that decision herself or 2) she comes out to her mom and both parents can agree and have input.", "I love how you made all these assumptions that dad is in the wrong and clearly ignore than daughter felt so uncomfortable with her blabber mouth mom she only told her dad. Mom is in the wrong, stop trying to pin everything on dad cause of your sexism.", "You seem to be ignoring the fact that I\u2019m not saying OP should have told his wife about their daughter\u2019s sexuality (the thing she uncomfortable sharing). \n\nI\u2019m saying he should have kept the secret, but he had no right to unilaterally give the daughter permission to start dating.\n\nVery confused what if anything could be pinpointed as sexist here. Mom doesn\u2019t have a right to know the girl is dating because it\u2019s a girl, it\u2019s because she\u2019s her parent. If OP was the wife who kept the secret from her husband I would say the same."]}
