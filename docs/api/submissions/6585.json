{"id": 6585, "submission_id": "104ao0g", "title": "AITA for keeping a three year long secret from my wife because our daughter asked me to?", "selftext": "Three years ago our daughter was 12 and came to me because she had developed feelings for another girl at school. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly what she was going through, but realized she never had interest in boys. We spoke, she later determined on her own, she is a lesbian. She asked me not to tell anyone, I respected her wishes and wanted her to feel completely in control. \n\nFast forward to now, she\u2019s 15 and in a relationship which I was the only one in the family that knew. She determined recently it was her time to come out. Just after doing so I immediately sat my wife down to discuss the issue with her parents. I\u2019d prefer if we could all act as if they fell off the face of the earth, but that\u2019s not going to happen. She is very different from them, they don\u2019t see eye to eye on much. However, my wife is very open and tells all. I love her honesty, and she really is the best communicator I know. \n\nThat comes with drawback though. Part of the reason our daughter asked me to keep this a secret until she was ready, well that was because of her mom. We knew by telling her, she would make a huge announcement to the family, Facebook and probably put it on a billboard (kidding). My wife agreed not to tell her parents seeing that they would cause our daughter pain based on how they are full of hatred towards anyone that doesn\u2019t fit in their shoebox. To my utter shock, they don\u2019t know a thing as even my wife\u2019s sisters know but haven\u2019t told them either. \n\nHowever, my wife is very upset I had gone 3 years keeping this secret from her. She\u2019s not upset with our kid, but with me. She says only dysfunctional families keep secrets from each other. She feels like an outcast, as if my daughter and I have a relationship that doesn\u2019t involve her. She feels her honesty all these years have led to her being disrespected and disregarded. Her behavior has made our child feel bad, that\u2019s the last thing I wanted. \n\nI\u2019ll admit though, I did feel like I was hiding something every time I drove my daughter and her girlfriend on a date. Referring to her only in front of my wife as the friend and not the girlfriend also seemed wrong to me. Nonetheless, this is what my daughter wanted. She wanted to come out on her own terms, she wasn\u2019t ready for everyone to know. Had I told my wife and she let it out, my daughter would have never trusted me again. I feel like I did right by my daughter, but not by my wife. AITA?\n\nETA: I\u2019m seeing in the comments there\u2019s some confusion about her current relationship. When she was 12 and developed a crush, it never went anywhere. She wasn\u2019t dating for 3 years, it\u2019s only been for the last few months. It\u2019s also her first relationship. I think at 15 she has a right to date without her parents permission. That\u2019s not to say she can go dating anyone without us knowing. With that being said, yes, I realize it was wrong for me to lie to my wife about who the \u2018friend\u2019 really was.", "created_utc": 1672953913, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104ao0g/aita_for_keeping_a_three_year_long_secret_from_my/", "score": 2386, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't out people without their permission, period. In this case you were put in kind of an awkward position and I understand how your wife feels, but if you had told her without your daughter's permission that would have been wrong.", "NTA.

That\u2019s the most important reason for anything. She wasn\u2019t in danger and she knew that you were safe, destroying that, by telling your wife would have been 100x worse. \n\nYou are a great father!", "NTA. You had no choice. But I'm so sorry you found yourself in such a difficult position. Also understand why your wife is upset and hurt - but it's so unfortunate that she's upset with you when it was your daughter's decision not to trust her with deeply personal information. I'm not saying she shoud be upset with your daughter either - but the dynamic that made your daughter cautious about sharing with your wife starts with her and how your daughter sees her. If a family counselling session is an option, it might take these conversations in a better direction.", "Nah. Your wife is hurt and that is valid, you respected your daughter's wishes and that is also valid.", "This is truly the best reason to keep a secret. The fact that it is your wife is not relevant in this case. NTA", "NTA. It simply wasn\u2019t your secret to tell. I can understand why your wife is a little sad, but you still did the right thing", "Your daughter is at an age when respecting her privacy is CRUCIAL to having a good relationship with her. This secret was not harmful to anyone, so it wasn\u2019t something you absolutely should\u2019ve told your spouse. You did a huge chunk worth of parental work by keeping your word. Congrats, you proved to your daughter that you deserve her trust! NTA", "NTA. It wasn't your secret to tell. This information wasn't injuring anyone. Yes, your partner may need to redirect anger at you for not being selected but you are not wrong here. Otherwise you'd lose your developing bond and trust with your daughter", "NTA\nI agree, it wasn\u2019t your secret to tell. \n\nYour wife is now realizing that her idea of honesty is telling everyone everything and that now that she sees the flip side of it, she will change her ways. This is a good thing. \n\nShe should let your d know that she realizes why d wouldn\u2019t tell her and that now that she sees the repercussions of her flawed strategy she will respect whatever d chooses to share with her. \n\nThis could turn out to be a good thing.", "NTA \nYou did the right thing. It's never your job to out other people.", "NTA. Your child is allowed to keep information to herself or limited to chosen trusted individuals. It\u2019s really sad that she knew your wife wouldn\u2019t keep her \u2018secret\u2019 until she was ready. The potential damage to your daughter was more important than your wife\u2019s wants in this case.\n\nIf your wife can\u2019t keep others\u2019 secrets, that\u2019s not a \u2018good communicator\u2019, that\u2019s a blabbermouth - therefore keeping information from her is a necessity. She needs to build others\u2019 trust in her ability to keep quiet when asked.", "NTA - you made a promise to your daughter to keep her confidence.  You kept your promise.  There are some issues that require breaking a confidence for the safety of those involved but this wasn't one of those cases, in fact the opposite.  You were also protecting your wife from having to keep secrets from her parents.", "NTA.\n\nYou were in a somewhat uncomfortable position needing to keep that from your wife, sure. However you would have really been TA had you betrayed your daughter's trust. Does your wife think it's okay to betray people's trust?", "Going to say NAH\n\nYou did the right thing by your daughter- hands down. You get father of the year seriously!\n\nYour wife has a right to feel hurt- but her anger towards you is inappropriate. You alluded to the fact that she's an excellent communicator and her parents may not be accepting. It sucks that your daughter didn't trust her mother at first but maybe this is an opportunity for your wife to show that while she is great at communicating she knows when she shouldn't.", "NTA your daughter wasn't ready to tell her, if you told her you would have been betraying your daughters trust and forcing her to come out before she is ready. Remind your wife that somethings are not about her and your daughter was not ready for her to know, it's that simple.", "NTA.\n\nYour child came to you with a secret. A secret that would hurt no one and was hers to share when she was ready. You supported her in that despite that it was probably awful to not be able to speak to your wife about it.\nHad you had told your wife, even if she said nothing, you would have been breaking your daughters trust and you can\u2019t get that back. \n\nI am assuming you encouraged your daughter to be honest with her mom, but all in all this is kick ass parenting. \n\nGood job!", "It put you in a bad situation, but it wasn't your secret to reveal. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou should be proud that your daughter trusted you and you honoured that.\n\nNot many teenagers have that relationship.", "I'm sorry your wife is feeling hurt about this, however I am grateful your daughter could confide in you.  Over the years I figured out the relationship our daughter has with her dad is much different than the one she has with me.  It's not because she loves me or trusts me any less than him, but because of who he is to her if that makes any sense.  I get to handle some of the more emotional touchy subjects with her while she's more open with him on other topics concerning her future goals and plans.  Likely cuz I'm the realist and my hubs is a dreamer like her?  I am more cautious and he's more let me help you get it done lol.\n\nHowever you do owe your wife an apology for not trusting her enough to keep it from the toxic side of the family.  And as  you now know you really should have.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter had the right to decide if she trusted her mom as a safe person to come out to. She decided to tell you and asked you to not tell anyone.\n\nYou would have been an AH to violate her confidence. Your wife is being selfish and entitled trying to make it about herself.\n\nFrankly, her reaction seems to be proving the point", "NAH. O would of done the same thing if I were you!! It wasn\u2019t your secret to tell and you did absolutely right by your daughter! But I see your wife\u2019s point and feelings as well! Try to put yourself in her shoes and if you didn\u2019t know for the last 3 years she was hiding a big secret about your child. She\u2019s valid in how she feels as well!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was your daughter's secret, not yours.", "NTA- it sounds like your daughter had a good reason to not tell her mom until now. Even if she would have been supportive, that doesn't mean your daughter wants her to start announcing it to everyone, especially people who she knows will react badly. It's hard keeping secrets from a spouse and I understand why she might feel hurt, but she needs to understand that it is not your place to tell this kind of secret. Outing someone without their consent is extremely harmful, and if you had told your wife it would have, at the very least, severely harmed your relationship with your daughter. She saw you as someone she could trust, and by keeping her secret until she was ready to tell people you have shown she was right to have that trust in you. I think it would be helpful for you all to sit down, possibly with a family therapist, and discuss why your daughter felt the need to hide this from her mom. A therapist who is experienced with LGBTQ issues could be especially helpful in explaining why people choose to hide their sexuality for long periods. It is usually to avoid judgement or harm. And your wife making announcements without your daughter being ready would have been harmful. Your wife can explain that she feels hurt by this decision, but there should not be any blame put on your daughter. Your wife is hurt, and that is valid. However your daughter is also valid in keeping this secret until she was comfortable. Her sexuality is not anyone's business but her own, and anyone she chooses to share it with. Your wife needs to understand that it was her own actions which caused your daughter to feel she was not a safe person to come out to until now. Essentially her past actions showed that she is not someone to trust with a secret. If someone can't keep a secret, then telling them something is basically telling everyone. Even if your daughter wanted to tell her mom, she didn't want everyone else to know. And she probably felt there was no way to keep your wife from telling people.", "NTA. It was never your place to tell anyone. Your daughter trusted you and wasn't ready to come out to anyone else. You may have been keeping the secret from your wife but you were respecting your daughter's boundaries. Your wife will hopefully come to realize that it was never your secret to share.", "NTA\n\nI had a similar thing happen when my son came out to me but wasn't ready to come out to his dad/my husband. \n\nIt only lasted about two months till he did a dramatic come out on insta. At which point he had a conversation with his dad. \n\nThose were such a difficult two months for me, I can't imagine what you went through keeping that for three years. But that was the correct decision. \n\nThere are times when being a good parent conflicts with the idea of being a good spouse. As much as I don't have secrets in my relationship, this was not my secret to tell. It was my son's. \n\nYou were not withholding crucial information about yourself or your relationship. You were keeping the confidence of your daughter. \n\nYour wife probably feels guilty that her daughter did not feel comfortable confiding in her. I'm sure that hurts.  Instead of looking inward for the reason and adjusting, she is looking for someone to blame.", "You were in a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation.\n\n I think you are your daughter's hero. I think it is awesome that you kept your daughter's confidences. BUT on the other hand you and your daughter purposely lied and deceived your wife for 3 years! It is one thing to keep a secret by not sharing everything with a spouse when it it is not your secret to share. It is totally another thing to lie and deceive  for 3 years to your spouse. You earned your daughter's trust but at the same time you destroyed your wife's trust in you. The secret itself is not the issue. The lies and deception to your spouse are. Once trust is broken, the reason does not matter, it is not so easy to regain trust. You  value your daughter and her trust as it should be but you and your daughter obviously do not value your wife or her trust in you. You allowed a third person to come between you and your wife. It doesn't matter that is was on your daughter's behalf. If you could so easily lie and deceive your wife for 3 years then what is stopping you from lying and deceiving her again in the future about something else? How does your wife ever trust you again?\n\n Kudos for understanding the father/daughter dynamic. You suck at understanding how trust is supposed to work in a marriage and you may have totally nuked your marriage.\n\nNTA in regards to keeping your daughter's secret. Definitely TA to your wife.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think you were wrong to keep it a secret but I do think you were wrong In not encouraging your daughter to talk to her mom and to come out to her. Keeping your daughters secret was not wrong at all but honestly as a partner you looked straight in her face for three years and lied. Anyone would have issues with this and personally I would wonder what else could he be lying about to me. Your wife\u2019s feelings are valid as well because how you would you have felt if your wife lied to you for three years about something like this? Wouldn\u2019t that hurt you and make you feel like shit because the person you love has been lying to you and even if it\u2019s for a valid reason that\u2019s still a hard pain to deal with and then everything is just supposed to be ok and fine because you were keeping your daughters secret safe? You lied to your wife for three years and she never suspected a thing and now she has learned her husband who she loved and thought would not break her trust has done just that. It\u2019s about trust and it\u2019s hard to trust someone when you find out they have lied and you have done it for three years. \nTo me no one in this situation is an ass. \nYour daughter has a right to come out when and to who she wants.\nYou have a right to keep your daughters secret safe and make sure she is ok. \nYour wife has a right to feel hurt and anger at being lied to for three years. \nNow this is just based off what you have written. Humans are very complex and there are alot of nuances and dynamics that I do not know about as I don\u2019t know anyone involved. So my opinions and thoughts could change based on new info. I also don\u2019t know anyone else\u2019s brain and can only assume based on how I would feel about a situation and personally once someone has broken my trust I find it hard to believe them anymore because how am I supposed to know if they are lying or not. I think the best advice is to sit your wife down and have an open and honest conversation and say look while i understand your hurt and that your feelings about being hurt are valid and I\u2019m sorry my keeping it from you hurt you as that was not my intention but I am not sorry for keeping our daughters secret. She has a right to come out when and to who she feels ready to and at the time she wasn\u2019t ready to tell you and I wasn\u2019t going to go against her and Betray her trust. I am sorry that this has hurt you as well as maybe I should have tried harder to encourage her to tell you after a couple months. Something along those lines and then if she still can\u2019t get over it then it\u2019s on here. I don\u2019t agree with the comment about only dysfunctional families keep secrets but she might not believe that herself and maybe just said it in the heat of the moment. I do not know but I definitely think an open and honest conversation needs to be had and both of you need to explain your actions/reactions and why they happened. I don\u2019t know if you both have had a conversation or if it\u2019s just been passing remarks or if you explained yourself to your wife already. I hope this helps in some way. Sometimes there is no assholes in a situations cause either way you would have hurt someone but you choose correctly because if I was in your wife\u2019s position I would be happy you kept the secret and helped her but I would still feel very hurt and angry at being lied to and wouldn\u2019t know if I could continue in a relationship with someone I wasn\u2019t sure I could trust again but I have big trust issues from being abandoned and lied to alot through my life so my experiences have shaped and changed how I view lying and it would also depend on how my husband went about things when it all came out and if he felt remorse or if he didn\u2019t understand why I felt hurt. But I also have adhd and rsd ( rejection sensitive dysphoria) which I feel greatly effects how I see things like this as for me I would feel like absolute garbage for not only being lied to but also because my daughter and my husband both felt I couldn\u2019t be trusted with something like this and I would feel like a horrible mother and wife. I want to reiterate that her feelings while valid are not your or your daughter\u2019s responsibility. You did nothing wrong and neither did your daughter. Also want to add that sometimes people turn sadness and hurt into anger instead because it\u2019s easier to be angry than it is to feel sad", "YTA.  While it was ok to simply keep a secret, you went beyond that.  You actively lied to and deceived your wife for 3 years while you facilitated your daughter's dating habits.  That was wrong.  You should have told your daughter that you wouldn't tell her secret, but you also wouldn't help her go behind your wife's back for things.\n\nYou could have used this as a teaching lesson for your daughter in how a good spouse behaves.  Instead you chose to be a bad husband and not-that-great dad.", "NAH\n\nYou were being a good father, and you did great\n\nBut your wife is in here right to be pissed, the man she loves and her own daughter kind of excluded her for 3 years (For goods reason yes, but still)\n\nI think it's the kind of moment you accept that the best choice, what you did, wasn't a good choice, because sometimes, there's just no good choice\n\nAsk your wife forgiveness and by how you described it, she'll understand\n\nYou have to take the hit for the family dude", "NAH. \n\nYour wife is justified in her hurt. You also were right to respect your daughter\u2019s decision.  I hope your daughter has communicated to her mother how strongly she felt that you not say anything, that she asked you and you\u2019re grateful you respected her decision. \n\nI know she\u2019s a kid. But she asked you to risk the trust between you and your wife. She now needs to be part of fixing that.", "NAH. How do you expect your wife NOT to be upset with you, really? I hope you encouraged your daughter to trust her mother multiple times and ways. That was your responsibility in this.", "NAH. Everyone is entitled to their feelings here. If I were you, I would've made the same choice. And I would've made it with the understanding that it might upset my wife one day. But those are my values. I'm sure you didn't intentionally hurt your wife, and it sounds like you have considered over the years how she might feel to be left out, then ultimately chose to keep your daughter's confidence. As your daughter ages, you'll see how valuable that choice becomes to your relationship with her (spoiler alert: very!)\n\nYour wife might want to take a look at why your daughter didn't want her to know. And she's wrong that only dysfunctional families keep secrets. I'd argue that healthy families have healthy boundaries, and that includes respecting reach other's boundaries and the ability to have privacy and share things in your own time.\n\nFor your part, you've made a choice that helped your daughter but hurt your wife. You should ask what she wants from you here. An apology? A promise to never do it again? And then you can decide if that's something you're willing to do to make it up to her.", ">She is very different from them, they don\u2019t see eye to eye on much.

The wife feels obligated to information that was told in confidence to her husband and is taking it out on him.

I don't think none queer people understand how hard it can be to come to term with your sexuality even for me and i grew up in a liberal home where my mom always explicitly said she wouldn't care if one of her kids were gay. I ended up coming out to the rest of my immediate family when i was 16 because i had grown into myself and become comfortable in my own skin but i was still too nervous to do it in person so i texted everybody at 3 a.m..

The mother (probably straight) NEEDS to understand it if she wants to be an ally. She needs to understand what coming out means, all the implications it has, how dangerous it is to out someone and start a chain of events. She needs to understand this.

She can be sad, but if the daughter didn't feel protected in coming out with her, she needs to understand the reasons, work on that (probably already did in good part, since the daughter eventually told her) and realize that her feelings are less important than the security of her daughter. If a child doesn't come out to you, you need to work on that, analyze why. \n\nWe could also add that if a parent REALLY is put between choosing the spouse feelings or the child security, they should choose the child security. The parents are adults, they can work on their feelings. The child isn't an adult and needs to be protected (granted that even as adults, outing someone is wrong anyway, but in this case the young age is an additional thing).

No matter what she does, I will never forget how she puts me deliberately at risk with my dad. Some of queer friends decided to forgive, other didn't. It isn't rare that young queer people don't forgive being outed, especially at a young age. The trauma of being suddenly exposed to potential homophobia without being ready isn't something you can erase. \n\nHandling homophobia is one thing (horrible, but once you come out, you are at least ready to face it). Being outed place you at the center of potential homophobia without being prepared nor having the chance of doing it in your own terms.

At 12, dating pretty much consists of hanging out and doing stuff together, like movies or bowling or wandering round the mall, maybe holding hands. If you say \"no dating\" it will just be couched within group hang outs that the couple will then split from - unless you lock your kid up except for school hours, and then guess what?

They aren\u2019t old enough to make all decisions at 16, but they\u2019re old enough to make a lot more decisions about themselves. Some people might feel the boundary is 18, but I personally think when it comes to dating, it\u2019s fine if a 16 year old is dating when their parents don\u2019t want them to be. At the very least, they can legally start driving at 16, so you have to be comfortable with not fully knowing where they are at all times. It seems like an appropriate time to relax boundaries around dating. That age range at which that boundary is lifted shifts with each person. \n\nSurely OP doesn\u2019t think the boundary should be 12 years old. That\u2019s way too young. More importantly, it seems like his wife\u2019s opinion should have been taken into account. Given that we\u2019re all strangers and it doesn\u2019t matter how we feel.

You don't out people. Period. You don't. It's a safety issue because the world still very much HATE us. Not outing a person is not lying and deception. Is doing the right thing. Some families absolutely m\\*rder LGBT+ kids if they come out, or they kick them out when they're still minors, or they make their life a living hell so much that the kid commits s\\*icide. Do you not live in this world? The daughter felt her mom wasn't a safe person and she PROVED she very much is not a safe person, since she is upset and making it all about herself instead of supporting her daughter.", "No, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want her to feel pressured into coming out. She knew by telling her mom everyone would soon know. I think that was fueled by her mom posting on Facebook when our daughter first got her period. She was mortified when she found out what she had done. She felt violated, understandably. The post was removed but not before everyone saw it.", "Completely agree with you. NAH is the right call, he had two choices and he did what he felt was right, his daughter trust in him was kept and they will have a great relationship, but he also lost all the trust from his spouse. 3yr is a long time, from now on she will always imagine if there is anything else he is keeping/lying from her. I understand his feelings and why he did it but the marriage would be done for me also. The worst part for me is that they never tried to trust her with the secret, she was never the issue, her oversharing was the issue but when it counted she proved she could be counted on, so now she feels hurt by them not trusting her with something so serious, for lying and keeping things from her. I don\u2019t fault her at all. This marriage may be done.\nOP was right in keeping his secret as his daughter asked him to, he make the choice who prioritized her and for this is he is a great dad, unfortunately there are some consequences, his marriage may be done and if it happens the daughter will forever blame herself. Everyone can come out hurt. I feel bad for everyone involved.", "The daughter is also learning that her mom can be trusted as well. This is a great development for the whole family, I just with the mom could see past her own self on this one. I totally get it, having people keep secrets from you hurts, but this wasn't OPs secret to tell and she needs to understand that. \n\nI hope with some counseling, everyone can be on the same page again.", "If we lived close by I'd bake you cookies. :(", "She has, my wife posted on Facebook when our daughter got her first period. Another mom told her kid, that kid told other kids and it got back to my daughter. She was mortified, post was deleted eventually. But the damage was done. There had been other incidents as well, good and bad that was told to others.", "She had a lot of doubts since she originally told me, she just wasn\u2019t ready yet even after she did realize her feelings. Being in a relationship confirmed her feelings, this is who she is. She was ready to tell, she wanted everyone know her friend is her girlfriend. Btw, current gf and my daughter have been together for a few months. There was some confusion on that, the girl from when she was 12, nothing came of that.", "[deleted]", "Mine thought it was OK to give my unlisted phone number out to anyone who asked for it. This was back when you had to pay $6 a month to keep your number out of the White Pages. I ended up changing it, and NOT giving it to her. My siblings are the same way, don't believe in keeping anything confidential. And they wonder why I don't tell them anything.", "You obviously didn't read what I wrote.", "People seem to be missing this detail: \u201cHer behavior has made our child feel bad, that\u2019s the last thing I wanted.\u201d It sounds like Mom is reflecting on her behaviour, and sees that in her daughter\u2019s eyes she\u2019s not to be trusted.  If you\u2019re a good parent his info would gut you.  Also it looks like everyone is keeping the news away from Grandparents, so maybe this mistrust was misplaced.  No one should be outed before they\u2019re ready.  Maybe counseling for Mom would be a good idea, NAH.", "You said OP was TA for lying and deceiving his wife and you don\u2019t treat people you love this way. So by extension so is the kid and every other closeted person. So yes. I did read your post.", "Good thing OP didn\u2019t have that attitude then.", "\u2026 are you okay?  the only correct thing to do when someone confides in you about their sexuality is not out them to anyone else, point blank period.  the daughter\u2019s comfort is PARAMOUNT in this situation, especially as she was a 12 and now 15 year old girl.  parents have a greater responsibility to their children than they do their spouses.  OP\u2019s wife\u2019s feelings may be hurt, but the discussion of her daughter\u2019s sexuality and the reason why she wasn\u2019t come to 3 years ago are wholly between the wife and daughter.\ncalling the whole situation damaging \u201cby mistrust and deceit\u201d is an extremely charged statement that has no place in this argument.  \u201cexperiencing anxiety\u201d and being outed are two very VERY different things, especially at such a young age.  and yeah, she \u201csome day\u201d may likely have a life partner, but right here and now, she has her parents.  she justified her request (and OP\u2019s decision) to not go to her mother because her mother discloses information to others without necessarily asking permission first.\nthis whole thing revolves around consent.  OP had his daughter\u2019s consent to know about her sexuality.  OP\u2019s wife did not until recently.  it wasn\u2019t OP\u2019s information to freely share.", "[deleted]", "No, because your daughter knows now \n\nYes, you do have to work past it because it is you that\u2019s holding onto the negative feelings\n\nYour daughter was a scared child, the fact you can\u2019t recognise that is astounding \n\nShe made a decision rooted in fear, worry and anxiety as a child whose brain was not fully developed\n\nGet therapy, get family therapy\n\nBut you\u2019re an adult, learn to let go", "I would have to disagree with your judgement. Wife doesn't have a right to feel hurt if she's comfortable having her bigoted parents around, even if she's supposedly \"very different\" from them. \n\nFrom the daughter's caution, I'm willing to bet the mom has put her parents before her kids/spouse before. Or at the very least excused their bigoted behavior so she didn't have to step up and challenge them. \n\nIf OP also thinks the parents would have caused his daughter pain, he has every right to protect his kid. Sounds like he didn't trust his wife either due to past behavior. \n\nActions have consequences. Maybe this will help her learn to prioritize her child over her parents.", "> I love my mom, but nothing stays a secret with her.\n\nSame here. My mom is my most favourite person in the entire planet. ...BUT...nothing stays a secret. She doesn't do it maliciously, it's just part of who she is. So you learn what to tell her and what not to tell her.", "Where did you see that the daughter was dating at 12? All OP said was that at 12, she expressed having feelings for another girl. That doesn't constitute dating.", "I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s some confusion there. She has not been dating for 3 years. The girl she had a crush at 12, nothing ever came of that. Her current girlfriend has been a few month long relationship. I believe my daughter caught on I was starting to become uncomfortable with hiding things for her. Probably motivated her to come out, but my intentions were never to force her.", "Aww thank you kind stranger. I'd eat all the cookies tbh \ud83d\udc9c", "Was just going to say the same. Of course you have a different relationship with your daughter than your wife does. There are three relationships here. 1. You and your daughter. 2. Your wife and your daughter. 3. The three of you where the group dynamics come into play.  \n\nIt\u2019s understandable that your wife feels put out that you kept a secret for 3 years BUT, you had valid reasons. It\u2019s never acceptable to out some one without their permission, and it\u2019s not your place to do that. Also, why does the daughter want it kept from mother for so many years until she is ready for mom to know? \n\nYou kept a secret from her because if you had told her it would be spread all over , to relatives and social media- IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SECRET ANYMORE!!  Totally disrespectful to the person ( her daughter no less) who wanted this very personal detail about her self to stay private until she was ready to share. That is what mom should be focusing on .. her own behavior and the trust issues that affect her relationship with her daughter. \n\nYou are an amazing dad. NTA.", "She\u2019s going to go on dates whether he lets her or not. The only way to avoid it would be to ban her from ever going out unattended. She trusted her dad enough to tell him and he handled a difficult situation really well.

Since you know me and my life so well, I'll definitely take what you say seriously.", "Dating just started! She is 15 now! Pretty normal to see somebody (either boy or girl) at this age! Imagine she didn't tell Dad. He would drive the girls and wouldn't know it's a date. So what. I would be happy my daughter felt safe with a parent and check how I could make her safer in the future so she feels like coming to me as well.

And I don't need to know everything...", "Right I'm like woah she needs therapy (I say so because this could be a symptom of her not having a better outlet to discuss these thing or of her seeking attention and now why she does this is only really for her or a therapist to figure out).", "Now but who's to say she wouldn't have said something 3 years ago I say the daughters peace of mind on not being outed until she's ready is what matters here.", "Good job. I still say OP was TA for lying to and deceiving his wife and you don't treat people you love this way. I also still say OP was NTA for keeping his daughter's secret.\n\nI don't get your by extension comment.", "What's the alternative? Daughter not telling either parent and sneaking out? at least OP knew where his daughter was.", "They were also lying to protect your child and to support them."]}
