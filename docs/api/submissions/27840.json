He will recover. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It sounds like he's actually jealous. He might actually be a very  good cook but if you're at a professional level he's feeling inadequate.", "Ruined restaurants? I mean that's a compliment, right? Or maybe find some better restaurants to your liking or out of your cuisine cooking expertise. \"Doesn't feel homemade\" makes no sense, fine dining is fine dining because small details can take many man-hours to perfect as a compliment in a dish. Maybe he had shitty meals growing up hahaha.", "NTA. Maybe it should just look more \"homemade\" just make him a nice meal and then plate it how a toddler would", "NTA he is the biggest idiot I have read about today. \n\nFind someone who would never make your skill into a negative thing, who would never take your generosity as an insult. Those are childish selfish behaviors and I doubt this is the only instance he acts this way. \n\nIf he wants to show off he should learn some things from you and then try to outshine you with a top tier meal himself; it could be a fun friendly competition where you both grow more skilled and eat amazing food. Instead he wants you to lower yourself to his level. \n\nHe wants to be better than you, that's important to him. He literally said it. That's not a team that's going to have an advantage in the world, that's a rivalry.", "This scenario makes no sense, I can't imaging someone being upset at their partner for being good at cooking... and even if they were, it wouldn't be for making them like restaurants less.", "He's jelly, but other already said that. NTA\n\nBut some advice, to a newly living-together couple. You want to spoil him, make things nice, play-house. I get it, expecially if you hadn't lived with someone else romantically before him.\n\nthe advice--don't be to nice. Don't spoil him. thats it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo your general half of the household duties. Stop there. It is incredibly easy to start out doing most of the work, but incredibly difficult to roll back to equal work years down the line. life will get complicated and tiring. 'Playing house' gets alot less fun when the other person begins to thank you less and expect you to do all. I've seen friends fall into this trap, read other women's experiences.  Sometimes the guy is more at fault in not knowing how to take care of chores themselves. but sometimes the girl is at fault too if she helps create this home-life where she does the majority but expects anyone to WANT to take over chores later. I'd be spoiled too if roles reversed", "NTA  \n\n\neasy solution, only cook for yourself and let him have average food at home and better at restaraunts if it is really that big of an issue that he gets \"better food\" from restraunts.  \n\n\neasier solution, break up with him and finds someone that apprieciates good home cooked food, if you prefer cooking for people", "My mother seldom wanted to go out to eat because she was the better cook - lol!\n\nThis obviously needs more discussion, because I would think a well-cooked home meal is what we all aspire to. When you start getting a few that can be done in under 30 minutes, that's a huge bonus.\n\nIt was a weird comment to make.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I will date you and appreciate any food and baked goods.

He'll rediscover his passion for restaurants and take you out to dinner (and he'll pay the bill).\n\nYet he'll find another way to complain and say that the restaurant's food isn't good enough.", "This is dumb.  Talk to each other and resolve your problems instead of trying to point fingers and figure out who's fault is it.", "NTA what a jerk he is \"Oh no please do not serve up your restaurant quality food to me, I might never be able to spend $60 on a pasta dish again.\"\n\nReasons to complain about food include: it's not cooked safely, it's not a dish I personally like, or it's full of things I'm allergic to.\n\nHe definitely doesn't deserve to be spoiled if he's going to act like this. Tell him if he's going to complain, he can cook for himself.", "NTA. Wow, the things people complain about! My husband is a better cook than I am, but I don't mind at all. He can cook for me anytime!", "NTA. I'm very confused. What a thing to complain about! Wish I had problems like this, lol.

Part of the deal was we took over the weekday cooking. To show our gratitude for them letting us move in we were cooking all of our best recipes. After about a month my father in law took my husband aside and asked us to stop cooking such good food, he was putting on weight. ;-)", "I\u2019m not arguing either side of this but are you missing that she moved him to the US.  Is english his first language?  If we are picking on tone and word choice, that would be a necessary detail.", "I am actually a pretty decent cook, but you don\u2019t have the time on a daily basis to put together a fancy meal. I also don\u2019t have the range of ingredients that they have in a restaurant where they are cooking for many people. \n\nFor example, I wanted to try a recipe that called for fennel and pernod. I did not want to spend $10 for the fennel and a lot more than that for a full bottle of pernod when I only needed a very small quantity of each for the recipe. \n\nWhen I go to a restaurant I don\u2019t order a steak that I can easily make at home, I will order the ostrich and raspberry coulis, or venison, things that I would not have at home for my family.", " No i didn't miss that, it's really hard to misconstrue enjoyment of food in  any language. Even if you're a fey sarcastic person it's hard to misconstrue that. Delicious food transends  cultural boundaries. Also she moved to the us for him not three other way around and her English seems pretty darn good so my point stands.   Edited to add that last part"]}
