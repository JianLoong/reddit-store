Her eyes don't get puffy or watery, she doesn't sound congested or anything, and she also doesn't get hives or a rash or anything... So I call BS. because she constantly talks about how bad her allergies are but I see no symptoms. \n\nWell, Sunday my dad proposed and of course, Kris said yes... Her apartment lease is coming up for her to renew if she wanted but last night they were talking about Kris just moving in with us... Then she said well if I'm living here full time the cats got to go she complained she's not always going to deal with her allergies. \n\nI told them no... I'm not willing to give up my cat. My dad pleaded with me saying it's unfair to Kris to have to deal with her allergies all the time while living with Us. Kris kind of had a smirk on her face while my dad was trying to bargain with me in that moment I knew she was definitely faking. After Kris left I told my dad I will never forgive him if he makes me get rid of my cat and I also told him I think Kris is faking being allergic to cats. \n\nHe got mad and told me I'm being a selfish brat and I just don't want him to be happy.

Tell him you're allergic to her.", "NTA- cat was there before this gf came along, its also very cruel of him to say HIS happiness is more important then yours.  He can date this lady and she can live somewhere else for a few years until you can move out with your cat.", "NTA. Your cat predates his girlfriend/fianc\u00e9. Your future stepmother seems to be trying to assert her place over you by demanding you rehome your cat.\n\nThis is a very unfair situation to you that will surely result in bitterness towards her. I wonder if your father has given that any consideration.\n\nShe can get allergy shots or take medication for her allergies...this cat is bonded with you and is part of your family. I'm hoping you can talk to your father and convince him of these very relevant facts and maybe he will change his mind.\n\nIf he doesn't, maybe you can rehome your cat to a friend so at least you can visit.", "Nta she might have mild allergies; I am allergic to cats and.i still have 2 of them. I just am super on top of cleaning the litterbox, vacuuming and often keep the window cracked. If the fiancee has been hanging out at the house already, I doubt her allergies are so bad she couldn't live with a cat for 2 years. Maybe you could compromise and have the cat not allowed in some parts of the house? But yeah huge ah move for her and your dad to expect you to get rid of the cat. If they want the 3 of you to actually be a family I hope they reconsider.", "NTA. Pets are family, not something that can be passed around or given away when they become inconvenient.\n\nYou can warn your dad that you'll never forgive him, and you can warn him that you'll go no contact and move out as soon as you're of age. But at the end of the day it's your dad's house, and he can do what he wants.\n\nI think you need to approach this in a mature manner. Maybe write him a letter explaining your feelings, and that he is prioritising his own happiness at the expense of yours and the relationship you two have. But I wouldn't bring up how you think Kris is lying, as he'll just boil your reaction down to you just wanting him for yourself, and that you're trying to drive a wedge between him and Kris.", "NTA \n\nYou're being honest about your feelings. I won't forgive him either ;D", "I just had to help my cat over the rainbow bridge the other day, so maybe I'm oversensitive about this - but F those two! Do you have a trusted friend or family member that you would be willing to rehome your cat to - at least for two years (an extended foster situation)? That would probably be the safest for your cat. I don't trust those two \"adults\" - your cat will \"accidentally\" get out. It is much safer for your cat to rehome her as much as that sucks. \n\nI'm so sorry, if I lived close I would take the cat in, spoil her and even give her back when you got an apartment of your own. \n\nAlso, cat tax please!", "NTA\n\nThe cat was there first.  And there is no reason for your dad and Kris to rush into living together.  She can keep her apartment, you're old enough to be responsible if your dad is sometimes gone at night.  (And you'd better *be* responsible if he trusts you with this - it is not an excuse for parent-free parties!)\n\nYou'll be 18 in two years.  Presumably, leaving for college.  You'll probably need to make some sort of arrangements for the cat, then, as I doubt your father would keep it at home while you're away.  Either pet-friendly housing, home it with a friend while you are in school, etc.\n\nBut asking them to wait until you are 18 before disrupting your life this way is a reasonable starting point.  That gives you until you are done with high school and starting college, or a job, to sort out a longer term solution.", "NTA, but I don't think  you'll win this power struggle.  She's trying to \"put you in your place\" as she's going to be the queen of the house. Unfortunately, it probably won't stop there and she'll find other ways to get your father to do her bidding.  The cat has been in your life longer than this woman and has been a comfort. I don't understand why your father isn't trying to find a compromise with Grimhilde", "NTA - Whether your dad's fiance is faking or not, I don't know. But it's not okay to make someone get rid of a pet. And if there's one thing I've learned about lonely adults, it's so many of them are desperate for companionship and will lash out at anyone who gets in the way. You aren't doing anything wrong.", "NTA, the cat has been there longer if my math is right. As someone in a system who couldn't imagine life without our cat, I can't imagine telling someone that they had to get rid of *anything* of their own because someone who's moving in they had no opinion in, disliked it, let alone something living. You've had that cat from when she was a kitten, you are by no means required to forgive him and are in no way an asshole for reminding him that if he prioritizes her over you when all evidence points to her lying, that you will not be able to forgive him.\n\nMy half-joking advice is to tell him you're allergic to people who refuse to understand how much your cat means to you, and that the two of them will have to go. Or that you're allergic to fathers who prioritize someone they've known for probably about two years (who cannot prove her claims, I'm sure) over his own flesh and blood, that he's known for 16/16 of their years on this Earth.\n\nMy very deathly serious advice is keep an eye on your cat at all times if she moves in. Something may happen to your cat, ranging from an \"accident\" to her straight up stealing your cat, depending on how hellbent she is on taking your cat from you. Keep your cat in your room when you're not home, get cameras (that she doesn't know about preferably, so she wouldn't know to avoid them or possibly mess with the footage, circuit breaker if not battery powered, etc.) If you really want to prove her wrong, tell your dad she has to get tested for a cat allergy (with at least him present, so she can't lie about what was said.)", "NTA, I have a daughter, I am a father.  I always tell her stay focused on the subject and dont get caught up in the drama....i beleive you about your dads ladyfriend.  the best way is to not insult her, your dad is blindly in love.  but also should demand your pet stays!  or find another family member to live with!", "NTA.\n\nDo you have a therapist? Maybe they would be able to help. It sounds like your cat is an important emotional support for you, and that's even more important in a stressful time like your dad remarrying. If he's this neglectful of your well being, how does he expect you to support his relationship? \n\nIt sounds like Kris wants to drive a wedge between you and your dad.", "NTA, but ultimately it may not be up to you. If you're anything like me, you would never forgive a human being for doing something so despicable as to get rid of a pet for the sake of a person that got there *second*. It's fair to tell him that you would never ever forgive him or Kris for this. I know I wouldn't.", "You're an angry and hurt teen who loves her cat. Your  dad has found someone he loves and is upsetting your family dynamic. \n\nVery soft YTA for assuming Kris is lying because she doesn't show her allergy symptoms.", "NTA. Kris can take allergy medicine.", "Kris is testing your Dad by giving him a choice that pits her against you. I\u2019m so sorry. NTA.", "NTA \nNo way in hell I would have someone get rid of my cat. \n\nIf she lives there while the cat is there, WATCH the cat at ALL TIMES when you can. I wouldn't be surprised if she tries to get rid of it or cause an 'accident'.\n\nIf the cat isn't chipped, chip the cat to your name or a close family member you can trust with this situation. Make sure you know where your local shelters are. \nIf you start to suspect she wants to get rid of the get, maybe get in contact with the ahead of time with information about the cat, picturesz chip number, etc. \n\nThis may seem like a lot, but by cats are my BEST friends. They are my family. I would tear the world apart to get them back and keep them safe. \n\nAlso, while you're dad may own the house, you are living there also. The environment, while your there, needs to be comfortable and safe. That's his duty as your father. They both don't seem to care. \n\nIf he does get rid of the cat, even if it's to a family member, no contact would be a justifiable reaction. If he's willing to do this now, god knows what he'll do for her later at your expense.\n\nEdit: spell", "NTA but friend, be prepared to be shoved out of your dad's life slowly but surely.", "NTA. And while I agree with many posters here that she might very well be faking her allergies, I would not use that assertion in your argument. Because it is moot. It doesn\u2019t matter if her allergies are horrible\u2026 At all. What your dad is asking you to do is really awful and unfair. He is choosing a girlfriend over you. You may not be able to stop him, and my heart is very heavy for you, my dear. But please know that it doesn\u2019t matter. Evenif her allergies are very real, and very serious, it is wrong to make you get rid of your cat so that she can move in. And you would have every right to tell your dad that you will not forgive him if he makes you do that. I hope he will wake up here. Is there any chance you could get your therapist to talk to him for you? Or could you get another relative in your family to talk some sense into him?", "NTA but unfortunately you probably won\u2019t have a choice.\n\n \u201cKris\u201d can definitely take allergy medication or shots. My best friend is super allergic to cats, she has a cat. My uncle is allergic to cats, he\u2019s a veterinarian and has a cat. There could absolutely be some kind of compromise on her end until you move out which probably would be soon.", "NTA!!! You hold on to that kitty and don't let go. People like her think pets can just be tossed aside and she is definitely testing your dad to see who he sides with. He is making a huge mistake but unfortunately he won't see until it is too late and his relationship with you has been destroyed.", "NTA, but I doubt Kris is faking.\n\nAllergies don't have to be extremely noticeable to be generally terrible.\n\nBut your cat was there before Kris. I would feel the same way as you about getting rid of it.", "NTA.  You and the cat were there first.  She\u2019s replaceable.", "NTA it's your cat you love your cat and that's understandable she can manage \nMaybe make one or two rooms cat free zones (at least their bedroom maybe the living room or whatever room you expect her to spend most time in, if that's possible ) as a compromise so she can just go to a different room if her allergies get too bad \nSince you say she is probably faking anyway there wont be much need anyway\n\nAlternatively there is cat food that helps with reducing allergies feed say you wanna at least try that first that might buy you some time  too", "NTA\n\nSo he wants to add a new person to the house, without even talking about it to you first? \n\nThat means, sorry to say, he does not respect you . (ANY big change in our home  is talked through with the kids. We may try to show our pov, but we will listen and honor their opinions too)\n\nHe then wants to take away your cat just  so the new person has her way\n\nHe makes you feel so unwelcome that you, at 16, are already planning on moving out soon  which is robbing you of your childhood\n\nThats is some lousy parenting\n\nI'm affraid others are right though, your cat is not safe there. \nHe shows such a lack of respect towards you, he'll likely take matters in his own hand to get his way", "NTA and I'm livid at your father. You've had some terrible losses and now he wants to get rid of your little buddy over some lady who seems unaffected by it? Your father is being selfish. Frankly, I'm going to go fully judgmental here-- he's being shitty to you by forcing this woman into your house and life and expecting you to give up your pet  while you are still too young to make the choice to move out. If I were a parent in the same position, I'd be waiting until my child was old enough to make the choice to live with me and my new partner or leave, because this is a terrible time to move a new person in. That he chose to do this is one thing- to blame you for 'not wanting him to be happy' because he's taking away your pet is infuriating. You are not a spoiled brat, you are a kid who was abandoned and hurting, and bonded with a sweet little love of a critter. I'm in my middle age and can't imagine doing this to anyone I loved. If he thinks cats are disposable without harming his relationship with you, he's in for a huge reality check. I wish I could give him an earful!", "I would try to find alternative housing.\n\nDo you have a friend or family member who would be willing to take in you and your cat?\n\nYou should find a part-time job and start saving every penny.\n\nYou need to lookout for your cat and yourself.", "NTA.

But, uh, I do think we need to give Kris the benefit of the doubt regarding her allergies. I have a cat and am mildly allergic to it.

But it sounds like you've got a difficult situation on your hands, and you're going to have to be careful how you approach trying to stand your ground.  That \\*shouldn't\\* be on you, but apparently it is.\n\nFirst suggestion: talk to your therapist, in particular about how you feel that your father is deciding to change things about your family life, without seeming to care how it makes you feel.  That he's seeming to blame you for having any negative feelings about this being pushed on you (the whole \"you don't want me to be happy\" thing).  A parent should not be guilt-tripping their own child over the parent trying to bring someone new into the family unit. (The family unit being YOU and HIM.)\n\nAsk your therapist if it would be possible to have a session with both you and your dad, so that you can have a productive talk about what's going on, and a way to find options, rather than what you've got at the moment, which is just ultimatums.\n\nDon't ACCUSE Kris of lying about her allergies.  That just puts people's backs up and makes them stubborn.  Find a way to ASK QUESTIONS about her allergies in a way that is focused on finding a way to make her \"comfortable\" in the house, while allowing you to keep your cat.  How  bad are her allergies?  What steps is she taking / has she been taking so far, in order to be able to come be at your house?  He said it's not fair that she has to be \"dealing with her allergies all the time\", so the question is -- what does that entail?  Is it taking medication?  How well does that work for her, versus, what are the side effects?\n\nHaving a calmer discussion about that might help your father realize that Kris actually does very little (or seemingly nothing) to \"manage\" these allergies she says she has.  Or, you might find out that the reason it seems like she's never had a reaction is that she's never come over without taking medication first.  I'm with others in saying that she is obviously not \\*deathly\\* allergic, and it seems really unlikely that she has super bad allergies. People with serious allergies like that would not even go into a house that had a free-roaming cat.  Clearly she can function in the house, at least for the amount of time she spends there now.  So, how is she able to do that, but, why is that NOT a long-term solution for her, and you?\n\nWe don't know what your living situation is like, and what kind of space your house has.  But as others have suggested, I'd start looking at the house and trying to figure out whether there are some spaces that you can \"take over\" where your cat would be kept (with her litter box and everything), so that other parts of the house are made more comfortable for Kris to be in.  Does your house have a finished basement you could turn into your space?  Or can you sort of section off part of the upstairs that includes a room or two plus a bathroom? (Go on Amazon -- they sell all kinds of gates that are meant to help section off homes for pets.  They make some with small enough openings that a cat can't get through.  Many of these don't even require any hardware installation to work.)\n\nIn addition to trying to make separate spaces for the cat and for Kris, you should definitely point out that you're willing to have the cat's litter box in your area, and that you'll establish a schedule to keep it and the area clean. (Although the point is that it would be an area where Kris wouldn't go, and that Kris would not be responsible for housework in.   But that means you have to take responsibility for the housework -- such as cleaning the bathroom in that area, and doing all of the laundry from that area, like the bedding and towels.)\n\nAlso, take seriously the suggestion others have made about getting some HEPA filters.\n\nThe point here is to offer solutions and compromise, rather than you and them just throwing ultimatums at each other.  (Them demanding you get rid of the cat.  You saying you just won't, and demanding that Kris not move in.)\n\nCircling back to the allergies: if it seems like they are manageable (i.e. Kris has always taken Benadryl or something before coming over to your house), then part of your position should be, \"I've been living here my whole life, but in 2 years, that's going to change.  Even though Kris doesn't like having to take these medications all the time, I don't think it's unfair for us to come to this compromise for 2 years. If, that is, she expects to be living her with you long after I've moved out.\"\n\nBut, that brings up another good point -- you have GOT to have a plan for what to do with your cat when you go to college.  Clearly, you won't be able to leave the cat with your \"family\" (i.e. father).  So you should definitely start thinking about that now, and even figuring that into your post-high-school plans.  Can you pick a college where you're able to live in off-campus housing immediately?  Can you find any schools that have a dorm that allows pets?  That sort of thing.  Or, start talking to those far-away relatives NOW. Yes, you said they're a plane-ride away, but, people move via plane all the time, and take their pets with them. (Or make a multi-day drive, in order to move pets without taking them on a plane.)  If far-off relatives are the safest place to leave your cat while you're in school (even just for freshman year, until you can get off-campus housing), then figure out what the logistics will be for that.\n\nUltimately, I think that if you approach this as \"how can we make this work, for all of us?\" and if you offer reasonable solutions, and stay pretty calm about it, then either that will work and you can find a way for everyone to get through these next few years.  OR, by being the reasonable one, you'll expose Kris as demanding and unreasonable.\n\nAgain, it's not fair to YOU, that you have to be the reasonable one.  But it may be your best plan, at the moment.\n\nPlease do talk to your therapist.  Get some other adult advice, and see if you can get an adult to help you break this \"everyone is digging their feet in on their position\" situation that you now have with your father.  Talk to your therapist about helping you figure out how to make your father understand that you FEEL like he's showing that you aren't important to him; that he IS choosing Kris over you.  (And one thing that everyone will tell you is: keep your statements as \"I feel this\", not \"you're trying to--\".  \"When you do this, it makes me feel...\" is the way to go.  So, not \"Kris is trying to make you choose her or me\".  But, \"this makes me feel like I'm not as important\".)\n\nI'm really sorry.  This is a situation that sucks.  I hope you're able to find your way to some workable compromise, one way or another.  \n\nBut no matter what, you will NEVER been the asshole for prioritizing your cat.  People who see pets differently will never really understand it, but she is a part of your emotional well-being, and that's important.  And, you're responsible FOR her, and you take that seriously.  That's a good thing.", "So i think you need to temporarily place your cat with someone you trust that Kris has no access to. \n\nShe is trying to power play you here and she\u2019s winning. \n\nImmediately distance yourself from your father and find a part time job if you can.

Some people are like that.  Some people regard pets as family, and take their responsibility for a pet very seriously.  Some people see pets as \"just an animal\" and regard them as disposable.  He sounds like the latter.\n\nBut the key part is that he's completely prioritizing his girlfriend, and he's acting like his own daughter's feelings about the entire thing are less important.  It sounds a lot like he just expects his daughter to go along with everything to \"make him happy\", but he's not at all showing any concern for OP's happiness.  It doesn't SOUND like he sat down with OP and talked over what it would mean for them, as a family, if Kris moved in with them and if he married her.  He's just doing it, and OP  has to adjust.  That's pretty crappy parenting.  He's not seeming to regard he and OP as the family unit (that already exists), and Kris as the new person he's trying to bring into it.  That's where he's going wrong.", "Gf should be the one to live else where until OP moves out", "OP definitely show this to your dad.

I did and while she still caused me so much pain, I was able to keep going until I was free. My father was an enabler and I think yours could become one. Unfortunately, some children need to learn to protect themselves because no one else will.\n\nChip your cat. Or put a gps tracker on the collar. If you can, find someone to foster her until you can find a place of your own.
