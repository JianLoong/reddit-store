{"id": 2326, "submission_id": "yvacq1", "title": "AITA for asking for a morning off from my baby on the weekends?", "selftext": "My wife and I have a six month old baby girl. She's mostly a SAHM, she works two half days a week and her sister watches the baby. I work full time and go to school one day a week. We've always had an arrangement where she takes care of the household duties (cooking, cleaning, and now baby care) while I happily support her monetarily. Honestly, we are both living our dream life and my wife does an absolutely spectacular job taking care of me and our little one.\n\nOn the weekends, we share baby duty. We usually make sure each of us gets our own alone time to do whatever we want. However, our girl has hit a bit of a sleep regression, waking up every two hours--since my wife breast feeds, she's always taken care of the baby full time overnight. She's a light sleeper and unfortunately has insomnia, whereas I am a deep sleeper and wouldn't wake up for baby cries anyways .\n\nRecently my wife has been asking me to wake up with the baby both days on the weekends so she can get an extra hour of sleep. Baby wakes up around 7am. I get the baby dressed and take over for that hour.\n\nBut sometimes, I want to be the one that gets to sleep in an extra hour. I brought this up to her and she says while she's happy to let me nap during the day, she really needs that hour bc she can't nap like I can. We got into an argument about it, and she said I'm being very insensitive when I know she is very exhausted and cant nap during the day and she struggles going back to sleep every time the baby wakes up. But I'm exhausted too, work wears me out, and school days are long... and I sometimes want the hour in the morning. I don't want to spend my off time napping, I want to play videogames and chill out.\n\nI've gotten mixed opinions on who is in the wrong here, or if there even is anyone in the wrong.

We divorced when the kid was 2.", "YTA, if she's taking all the night duty because you don't wake up, then you get the morning duty when you do wake up so she can catch up on her lost sleep in the night. You want a morning off, give her a night off.", "YTA.  Your wife is correct.  And she needs the rest more than you do.  It's time for you to man up.", "RIP OP\n\nYou're going to be buried in the YTA judgements here.\n\nShe works PT, takes care of baby, has to do all the housework, has to do all of the night feedings, can't sleep.... but sure, you'd like an hour.\n\nYou are out of the house all week, and you do what, spend one hour a day \"helping\" to take care of your kid? And would like more time to play games?\n\nYou have no idea what her day looks like, do you? Take three days off, and send her on a mini vacay to sleep somewhere, and see all the stuff that she does on a daily basis, on repeat.", "YTA - You don't think she wants to just chill out and do something on her own time? She's working too by not just going to work, but also taking care of the baby. The least you could do is give her some time to sleep in. She's right; you can nap and do whatever, she can't. And unless you're going to offer to take over the feeding through formula, the ONLY time she gets a break is if baby is sleeping or she's off to work.\n\nGive up your extra hour of sleep; give it to your wife, who does so much.", "YTA - she's perpetually sleep deprived and an extra 1-2 hours on the weekend can make all the difference. Meanwhile, you get a full night's sleep EVERY SINGLE NIGHT", "YTA - so you get a complete full night uninterrupted sleep because you don\u2019t wake up (deep sleep, whatever) to feed/change your child and you still want more sleep? Your child wakes up at 7am\u2026. That\u2019s pretty conservative really\u2026. Mine are up at 5am\u2026. The joy\u2026.

She really, really needs it. \n\nI have had some really intense jobs (think working 16 hours a day and sometimes pull all-nighters as a political assistant to a MP) and that wasn\u2019t nearly as intense as being a mom and taking care of a baby. \n\nIt will get better.", "YT(major)A.

That's the absolute bare minimum you can do.  If you want her to get up at 7 am, then you get up during the night with the baby.  I'm sure your wife would be willing to pump if it means getting one whole night of sleep.", "YTA\n\nYour baby's sleep schedule will change. This regression can last days or weeks, but it won't last forever.\n\nYour wife is spending the whole night with a baby, and she is the baby's primary caretaker.

Video games and chilling can wait until the baby's schedule stabilizes. She is your wife, not your mom.", "YTA if she has over night duty every night while you sleep the whole night, she deserves to sleep in. Especially because you say you napping is taking away from you playing video games. So either go to bed earlier or skip your nap. She shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice her one hour of undisturbed sleep so you can play video games.", "YTA. Suck it up, buttercup.  Give your wife two mornings out of seven that she can get some rest.  It is beyond exhausting to be the sole feeder at night for a baby who wakes often -- especially for a breastfeeding mom who isn't a good sleeper herself.  \n\nThis, too, shall pass, but in the mean time, pick up a bit of the slack where you can.", "Well on one side of things we have: \n- nightly interrupted sleep multiple times for 6 months\n- sleep/exhaustion related illness\n- breast feeding concerns\n- caregiver burnout (which isn\u2019t talked about enough with SAHP) \n\n\nOn the other end of things we have:\n- \u201cI don\u2019t wanna nap during the day I wanna play video games and chill\u201d \n\nLook at it from outside of the perspective of your personal relationship and think about which one should be addressed first.", "these situations are so blatantly obvious. it\u2019s terrifying to imagine raising a child with someone who has to have basic fairness explained to them. \u201cshe\u2019s up every 2 hours but i think i actually need the extra sleep\u201d.", "YTA I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love the break too, but doesn\u2019t get it and can\u2019t schedule it any other time.  This phase doesn\u2019t last forever.  You\u2019ll have plenty of game time later.  Right now she needs you and she needs a break.  You can\u2019t imagine how hard it is being a new exhausted mother who has to breast feed too.  \n\nGive her a break.", "YTA. She is taking care of a baby all day everyday including the nighttime. You need to stop acting like a child and help out with the baby you created.", "I have read your post and some of your responses. I am honestly blown away by how selfish you are and how you don\u2019t seem to see it. But actually I think you are more than aware of it and are perfectly okay with being selfish so long as all your needs are met.\n\nAs a former breast feeding mother I completely understand where you wife is coming from. Her body aches, her hormones are out of whack, her nutrition might not be great, and she is exhausted mentally and physically. It is a kind of tired that you will never understand.\n\nYour wife need rest. She is verbalizing to you that she needs help. And she\u2019s not asking you to help by feeding the baby overnight with pumped breast milk. Because god forbid, you wake up in the night. She\u2019s simply asking you to let her catch up on the rest she\u2019s not getting right now.\n\nI don\u2019t think you can understand just how quickly someone can lose themselves when they become and mom and breast feed. Her entire existence has become 100% about someone else. And she does it every day. And she takes care of you. So who takes care of her? What will it take for you to realize she needs help since her asking for it didn\u2019t seem to be enough? \n\nIt\u2019s time to grow up. It\u2019s time to put the needs of your wife and baby ahead of your own because that is what it means to be a parent and a husband and an adult. Stop congratulating yourself for making your own lunches on occasion. Stop patting yourself on the back for giving her a break when you get home. A break that I am sure is really just her doing laundry, or cooking, or bathing. Those are not breaks. \n\nYour child deserves better from you. And your wife cannot be the parent she wants to be when she is exhausted and unsupported. This is how marriages end. Because she signed up to be your wife, not your mommy. \n\nTo put this into perspective for you, think of it this way. If your wife disappeared tomorrow, your entire life and home would be in shambles. If you disappeared tomorrow her life would be pretty much exactly the same except for that all important break when you get home from work. You shouldn\u2019t be okay with that kind of imbalance in your relationship. \n\nYTA.", "YTA Have you considered being sleep deprived with a 6mo old is dangerous. You want your baby's caregiver alert and functioning at her best at all times.", "YTA - You sleep the entire night uninterrupted. And you are begrudging your wife an HOUR of sleep in the morning? An hour? After you get a full nights sleep? And after she is up every two hours? \n\nYou say you don't want to use your free time to nap, because you want to play videogames. But what you are actually saying is that you want to sleep in AND play video games. All while your wife takes care of the baby by herself. \n\nIf she is working two and half days a week, it sounds like she is also contributing financially to the household. So not sure where you come off saying you support her financially.", "YTA. Welcome to parenting. Your wife has been up all night breastfeeding, whilst you get to enjoy your deep sleep.

She's mostly a SAHM, she works two half days a week and her sister watches the baby. I work full time and go to school one day a week. We've always had an arrangement where she takes care of the household duties (cooking, cleaning, and now baby care) while I happily support her monetarily. Honestly, we are both living our dream life and my wife does an absolutely spectacular job taking care of me and our little one.\n\nOn the weekends, we share baby duty. We usually make sure each of us gets our own alone time to do whatever we want. However, our girl has hit a bit of a sleep regression, waking up every two hours--since my wife breast feeds, she's always taken care of the baby full time overnight. She's a light sleeper and unfortunately has insomnia, whereas I am a deep sleeper and wouldn't wake up for baby cries anyways .\n\nRecently my wife has been asking me to wake up with the baby both days on the weekends so she can get an extra hour of sleep. Baby wakes up around 7am. I get the baby dressed and take over for that hour.\n\nBut sometimes, I want to be the one that gets to sleep in an extra hour. I brought this up to her and she says while she's happy to let me nap during the day, she really needs that hour bc she can't nap like I can. We got into an argument about it, and she said I'm being very insensitive when I know she is very exhausted and cant nap during the day and she struggles going back to sleep every time the baby wakes up. But I'm exhausted too, work wears me out, and school days are long... and I sometimes want the hour in the morning. I don't want to spend my off time napping, I want to play videogames and chill out.\n\nI've gotten mixed opinions on who is in the wrong here, or if there even is anyone in the wrong.

So...", "I mean, now they\u2019ve not been doing it for 6 months I expect it\u2019s going to be much harder for baby to take a bottle when she hasn\u2019t tried up till now. So yes, you are completely right. But it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s even tried as the reason he says he can\u2019t do nights is because he wont wake up.\n\nBut the point still stands that she never gets a night off, why does he think he should get a morning off?", "Especially when you say things like she \"does an absolutely spectacular job taking care of me and our little one.\"\n\nBruh, you're an adult man. Take care of yourself and take on 50% of the care of the daughter you 50% helped create.", "Someone extra to cook for and clean up after, in her *spare* time.\n\nMy FIL (in the **1950's**) knew enough to get up, change the baby, pop it onto Mum's boob (no formula, they were out bush), burp it and put it back in the cot once asleep.", "Exactly. He\u2019s not confused at all. She told him, and he said he doesn\u2019t want to.", "and this is why my partner and i have a cat.", "I think it\u2019s (sometimes) because they don\u2019t understand how hard a baby is or how difficult it is to do this day after day and week after week. \n\nOP might have misjudged the impact of having a baby on his ability to play video games or really figured his wife would just do it all herself. Not excusing this behavior. \n\nEither way, you can be surprised at how difficult the baby makes things, but that doesn\u2019t excuse you from being a parent. Struggling is okay. Giving up and assuming your partner will handle the rest is clearly not.", "OP is the asshole. \n\nBut come on, parents aren\u2019t allowed to complain now? Have you ever complained about your job? Or school? Or a pet?", "Because it's impossible to predict how hard it would, and btw people are complaining just to vent and feel better, it's totally normal", "Thank you. I didn't realize at the time that's what it was. Thank God those days are long gone. I mean, he still does the weaponized incompetence but it's for much lower stakes things like putting uber-greasy dishes in the dishwasher or throwing regular trash in the recycle.", "Yeah but with our first child, I actually had to sit my husband down and explain to him that it's a completely different thing to wake up, change diaper, feed, burp, change clothes and sheets because baby threw up, versus latching the baby on my boob half asleep and having someone else do all the other stuff. He didn't realize it was that different, because I \"had to wake up anyway\". \n\n\n\nNo worries, after that conversation, he did pull his weight, we have 6 kids now, and with the last few, I think I slept through at least half the night feedings. Either he started lactating or he was so good at rolling me on my side and latching that baby on my boob that I didn't even notice. (Maybe the exhaustion was a little at play there too \ud83d\ude02)"]}
