{"id": 2326, "submission_id": "yvacq1", "title": "AITA for asking for a morning off from my baby on the weekends?", "selftext": "My wife and I have a six month old baby girl. She's mostly a SAHM, she works two half days a week and her sister watches the baby. I work full time and go to school one day a week. We've always had an arrangement where she takes care of the household duties (cooking, cleaning, and now baby care) while I happily support her monetarily. Honestly, we are both living our dream life and my wife does an absolutely spectacular job taking care of me and our little one.\n\nOn the weekends, we share baby duty. We usually make sure each of us gets our own alone time to do whatever we want. However, our girl has hit a bit of a sleep regression, waking up every two hours--since my wife breast feeds, she's always taken care of the baby full time overnight. She's a light sleeper and unfortunately has insomnia, whereas I am a deep sleeper and wouldn't wake up for baby cries anyways .\n\nRecently my wife has been asking me to wake up with the baby both days on the weekends so she can get an extra hour of sleep. Baby wakes up around 7am. I get the baby dressed and take over for that hour.\n\nBut sometimes, I want to be the one that gets to sleep in an extra hour. I brought this up to her and she says while she's happy to let me nap during the day, she really needs that hour bc she can't nap like I can. We got into an argument about it, and she said I'm being very insensitive when I know she is very exhausted and cant nap during the day and she struggles going back to sleep every time the baby wakes up. But I'm exhausted too, work wears me out, and school days are long... and I sometimes want the hour in the morning. I don't want to spend my off time napping, I want to play videogames and chill out.\n\nI've gotten mixed opinions on who is in the wrong here, or if there even is anyone in the wrong.

He didn't take it serious and it took more effort from me to wake him up to help than it was to just do it myself. I stopped feeling like a human. The resentment never went away. We divorced when the kid was 2.", "YTA, if she's taking all the night duty because you don't wake up, then you get the morning duty when you do wake up so she can catch up on her lost sleep in the night. You want a morning off, give her a night off.", "YTA.  Your wife is correct.  And she needs the rest more than you do.  It's time for you to man up.", "RIP OP\n\nYou're going to be buried in the YTA judgements here.\n\nShe works PT, takes care of baby, has to do all the housework, has to do all of the night feedings, can't sleep.... but sure, you'd like an hour.\n\nYou are out of the house all week, and you do what, spend one hour a day \"helping\" to take care of your kid? And would like more time to play games?\n\nYou have no idea what her day looks like, do you? Take three days off, and send her on a mini vacay to sleep somewhere, and see all the stuff that she does on a daily basis, on repeat.", "YTA - You don't think she wants to just chill out and do something on her own time? She's working too by not just going to work, but also taking care of the baby. The least you could do is give her some time to sleep in. She's right; you can nap and do whatever, she can't. And unless you're going to offer to take over the feeding through formula, the ONLY time she gets a break is if baby is sleeping or she's off to work.\n\nGive up your extra hour of sleep; give it to your wife, who does so much.", "YTA - she's perpetually sleep deprived and an extra 1-2 hours on the weekend can make all the difference. Meanwhile, you get a full night's sleep EVERY SINGLE NIGHT", "YTA - so you get a complete full night uninterrupted sleep because you don\u2019t wake up (deep sleep, whatever) to feed/change your child and you still want more sleep? Your child wakes up at 7am\u2026. That\u2019s pretty conservative really\u2026. Mine are up at 5am\u2026. The joy\u2026. We did take it in turns to sleep in when they were little but that\u2019s because we BOTH took turns at night\u2026..\n\nEdit to add -> what\u2019s the difference between an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon????

She really, really needs it. \n\nI have had some really intense jobs (think working 16 hours a day and sometimes pull all-nighters as a political assistant to a MP) and that wasn\u2019t nearly as intense as being a mom and taking care of a baby. \n\nIt will get better.", "YT(major)A.

Get a grip and be a better partner and parent.", "YTA.  Your wife has to get up with the baby every night, 7 days a week.  The least you can do is get up in the morning with the baby.  That's the absolute bare minimum you can do.  If you want her to get up at 7 am, then you get up during the night with the baby.  I'm sure your wife would be willing to pump if it means getting one whole night of sleep.", "YTA\n\nYour baby's sleep schedule will change. This regression can last days or weeks, but it won't last forever.\n\nYour wife is spending the whole night with a baby, and she is the baby's primary caretaker. The least you could do is to give her that hour in the morning on weekends. \n\nTaking care of the house is a full-time job. Taking care of the baby is a full-time job.

Video games and chilling can wait until the baby's schedule stabilizes. She is your wife, not your mom.", "YTA if she has over night duty every night while you sleep the whole night, she deserves to sleep in. Especially because you say you napping is taking away from you playing video games. So either go to bed earlier or skip your nap. She shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice her one hour of undisturbed sleep so you can play video games.", "YTA. Suck it up, buttercup.  Give your wife two mornings out of seven that she can get some rest.  It is beyond exhausting to be the sole feeder at night for a baby who wakes often -- especially for a breastfeeding mom who isn't a good sleeper herself.  \n\nThis, too, shall pass, but in the mean time, pick up a bit of the slack where you can.", "Well on one side of things we have: \n- nightly interrupted sleep multiple times for 6 months\n- sleep/exhaustion related illness\n- breast feeding concerns\n- caregiver burnout (which isn\u2019t talked about enough with SAHP) \n\n\nOn the other end of things we have:\n- \u201cI don\u2019t wanna nap during the day I wanna play video games and chill\u201d \n\nLook at it from outside of the perspective of your personal relationship and think about which one should be addressed first.", "these situations are so blatantly obvious. it\u2019s terrifying to imagine raising a child with someone who has to have basic fairness explained to them. \u201cshe\u2019s up every 2 hours but i think i actually need the extra sleep\u201d.", "YTA I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love the break too, but doesn\u2019t get it and can\u2019t schedule it any other time.  This phase doesn\u2019t last forever.  You\u2019ll have plenty of game time later.  Right now she needs you and she needs a break.  You can\u2019t imagine how hard it is being a new exhausted mother who has to breast feed too.  \n\nGive her a break.", "YTA. She is taking care of a baby all day everyday including the nighttime. You need to stop acting like a child and help out with the baby you created.", "I have read your post and some of your responses. I am honestly blown away by how selfish you are and how you don\u2019t seem to see it. But actually I think you are more than aware of it and are perfectly okay with being selfish so long as all your needs are met.\n\nAs a former breast feeding mother I completely understand where you wife is coming from. Her body aches, her hormones are out of whack, her nutrition might not be great, and she is exhausted mentally and physically. It is a kind of tired that you will never understand.\n\nYour wife need rest. She is verbalizing to you that she needs help. And she\u2019s not asking you to help by feeding the baby overnight with pumped breast milk. Because god forbid, you wake up in the night. She\u2019s simply asking you to let her catch up on the rest she\u2019s not getting right now.\n\nI don\u2019t think you can understand just how quickly someone can lose themselves when they become and mom and breast feed. Her entire existence has become 100% about someone else. And she does it every day. And she takes care of you. So who takes care of her? What will it take for you to realize she needs help since her asking for it didn\u2019t seem to be enough? \n\nIt\u2019s time to grow up. It\u2019s time to put the needs of your wife and baby ahead of your own because that is what it means to be a parent and a husband and an adult. Stop congratulating yourself for making your own lunches on occasion. Stop patting yourself on the back for giving her a break when you get home. A break that I am sure is really just her doing laundry, or cooking, or bathing. Those are not breaks. \n\nYour child deserves better from you. And your wife cannot be the parent she wants to be when she is exhausted and unsupported. This is how marriages end. Because she signed up to be your wife, not your mommy. \n\nTo put this into perspective for you, think of it this way. If your wife disappeared tomorrow, your entire life and home would be in shambles. If you disappeared tomorrow her life would be pretty much exactly the same except for that all important break when you get home from work. You shouldn\u2019t be okay with that kind of imbalance in your relationship. \n\nYTA.\n\nETA: wow thank you all for the awards, I\u2019ve never gotten one! I\u2019m glad so many people have had the experience of breast feeding but with much more help than OPs wife.", "YTA Have you considered being sleep deprived with a 6mo old is dangerous. You want your baby's caregiver alert and functioning at her best at all times.", "YTA - You sleep the entire night uninterrupted. And you are begrudging your wife an HOUR of sleep in the morning? An hour? After you get a full nights sleep? And after she is up every two hours? \n\nYou say you don't want to use your free time to nap, because you want to play videogames. But what you are actually saying is that you want to sleep in AND play video games. All while your wife takes care of the baby by herself. \n\nIf she is working two and half days a week, it sounds like she is also contributing financially to the household. So not sure where you come off saying you support her financially.", "YTA. Welcome to parenting. Your wife has been up all night breastfeeding, whilst you get to enjoy your deep sleep. You can nap during the day if you are tired. Your commitment to being a good parent and husband outweighs your desire to play video games", "yta\\~ if its too much.

Your wife doesn't just work two half days, she works 24/7. Or do you think taking care of a home, a demanding husband and baby just does itself while she idly twiddles her thumbs?

She's mostly a SAHM, she works two half days a week and her sister watches the baby. I work full time and go to school one day a week. We've always had an arrangement where she takes care of the household duties (cooking, cleaning, and now baby care) while I happily support her monetarily. Honestly, we are both living our dream life and my wife does an absolutely spectacular job taking care of me and our little one.\n\nOn the weekends, we share baby duty. We usually make sure each of us gets our own alone time to do whatever we want. However, our girl has hit a bit of a sleep regression, waking up every two hours--since my wife breast feeds, she's always taken care of the baby full time overnight. She's a light sleeper and unfortunately has insomnia, whereas I am a deep sleeper and wouldn't wake up for baby cries anyways .\n\nRecently my wife has been asking me to wake up with the baby both days on the weekends so she can get an extra hour of sleep. Baby wakes up around 7am. I get the baby dressed and take over for that hour.\n\nBut sometimes, I want to be the one that gets to sleep in an extra hour. I brought this up to her and she says while she's happy to let me nap during the day, she really needs that hour bc she can't nap like I can. We got into an argument about it, and she said I'm being very insensitive when I know she is very exhausted and cant nap during the day and she struggles going back to sleep every time the baby wakes up. But I'm exhausted too, work wears me out, and school days are long... and I sometimes want the hour in the morning. I don't want to spend my off time napping, I want to play videogames and chill out.\n\nI've gotten mixed opinions on who is in the wrong here, or if there even is anyone in the wrong.

Perhaps this is difficult to see as she is not saying it explicitly, but she is struggling. Take it from all the kind strangers around the world- she is asking for help. \n\n- Perhaps from your perspective, things seem equal in terms of time spent \u2018doing stuff\u2019, but you are not taking into consideration that feeding and caring for a baby is far more physically and emotionally taxing than working and studying outside the home. And it never switches off. \nThe personal energy that each of you are contributing is not equal here. \n\n- When you say things like \u2018I try to help her by making my own lunches if she is overwhelmed\u2019 and \u2018I do chores if she asks me\u2019 what you are actually demonstrating is that you are not sharing the mental load involved with running a household and caring for a family. \nIt\u2019s not just *doing* the tasks that is tiring for your wife, it\u2019s *thinking* about what needs to be done ALL THE TIME. Because, she obviously knows she can not rely on you to see things, predict, pre plan, be proactive in the household. So, not only does she have to think for your child, she has to also think for you. This is absolutely exhausting and believe me when I say, will build deep resentment. \n\n- I am going to guess that playing video games is a tool you use for decompressing and is perhaps a sensory tool (either sensory seeking or sensory avoiding) that helps minimise autistic overload/meltdowns. \nThis is not a bad thing in and of itself. \nThink about the release of nervous energy and overwhelm that you get from playing your games. The lovely sense of disconnecting from the outside world that helps reset your nervous system. Think about how nice that feels and how even doing it for a short time can leave you feeling somewhat more positive and recharged. \nNow think about what opportunity your wife has to experience that same thing. \nIs she getting that opportunity? No. \nDoes she deserve that opportunity? Yes. \nDo you have the ability to give this to your wife? Yes, absolutely you do. \n\nThis is the point where you can turn it around and not be the AH going forward.", "Hold on. She takes care of the baby all week.

Now there's a new thing, a baby, and it's going to take a while to re-negotiate with each other a fair separation of duties.\n\nI think though, because you are able to nap and she isn't, it makes more sense for you to let her sleep in in the mornings and for you to take a nap later in the day. I know it's not ideal for you, but it's also not forever. Things will start getting better when your baby starts sleeping through the night.", "Im going to go against the majority here by saying NAH.\n\nMy reasoning is, \n\nYes she is needing sleep because of a 6 month old baby who is having trouble sleep. And also works a couple days a week. I understand that. I have a nephew around that age who is teething and keeps his mother and father awake. \n\nBut on the other hand I understand your half too, you are working five days a week and also doing school which takes up a lot of free time due to extra work you need to do for school so undoubtedly you may not be able to relax. \n\nI don't think either of you are in the wrong for both wanting more sleep, maybe try and talk to your wife at a time where she is calm and try and see what she would like to do. \n\nAnd maybe talk about trying to see if your wife would like to share baby responsibilities during the night so she isn't always pressured to being doing it all herself. I know what it's like to be a deep sleeper, I am one. Maybe your wife may need to shake you a bit to wake you up and ask you to sort the baby out because around about that age, your baby will start teething or already has so it is going to be more unfair on your wife if that's another thing she has to worry about. \n\nOP, you would only be an asshole if you were playing your video games all the time and not caring about your child or wife. But I see a man who is trying to do what he can with what time he has got around school and work.

It\u2019s all hard. \n\nShe deserves the extra hour, you deserve the video game time. Everyone needs some sleep and some down time. \n\nI think perspective is needed. The sleep regression won\u2019t last forever. The breastfeeding will get better and once she has more calories by way of food (she is 6 months so you can start feeding her the oatmeal/ baby cereals now)  she will sleep better. Go to the grocery store in the baby aisle and check out the things that say 6month+. Get started on introducing a food per day and especially the cereal and it will lighten the load for breastfeeding. Around 8 months she can also start drinking from the sippy cup and do water/formula milk and this will also help with keeping her full to decrease night feeding and your wife can sleep better. \n\nSo, my advice is take the hit. That extra hour in the morning you wake up go do video games with baby next to you. Then do afternoon nap time. \n\nIt won\u2019t last forever and fast forward 6 months you won\u2019t have to worry about this stuff anymore as breastfeeding is pretty much done. \n\nHelp her out now my friend.

Who has done it more?\" And then when he did get up, I'd lay there and think, \"I feel guilty now that he's up, maybe I should have done it.\" And I wouldn't get back to sleep until he returned to bed.

Its not just about the wife (which I do believe needs more sleep and needs met) but it is also about the husband. He needs time for himself. OP says that his wife sees him napping, where as playing a video game or two will also relax him. Most babies who are also awake during that time will watch him play the game too because of the colours. My brother has a nearly one year old and she loves it when he plays his games and watches him. The mother of the child is able to relax and do what she likes. It's a win win.

There is no \u201cceiling\u201d to how good you need to get because there is always another skill tier above you, up to pro. Also, even if you are comfortable with the tier you are in, like a slot machine the game is designed to keep you coming back.

May I remind you your wife doesn\u2019t get weekends and \u201cvideo game\u201d time, and apparently she also works. So why do you think you deserve those just because you work full time? When you work, you have your off time when you get home from your 8-10 hour job, and you even get weekends off. But your wife does not get any off time. Taking care of a baby is a 24/7 hour job. So for you to think you deserve weekend sleep ins and video game time just shows how irresponsible you are, and maybe you shouldn\u2019t have a baby at this point of your life yet. \nYes, I understand it is tiring and you would want to relax once in a while, but YOU chose to have a baby while you are still studying, despite knowing how hard it already is for most men to even learn how to balance between baby and work. And yet you put studying in the equation too. I\u2019m sorry, I know it seems very tiring and impossible, but you chose this so now you just got to deal with it no matter how tiring it is.

Dishes and dinner. Me. Warming bottles when I\u2019m there, cleaning pump and bottles, organizing and preparing milk and bottles. Keeping the house tidy.
