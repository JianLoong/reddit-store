{"id": 28120, "submission_id": "16ypf1f", "title": "AITA for being upset about not being invited to my wife's birthday party?", "selftext": "My wife is turning 35 and she is having a get together at a bar with a bunch of her coworkers and friends to celebrate multiple birthdays that are close together. She kept implying that I needed to stay home to watch our son even though we've gone out multiple times and left him with babysitters. Finally, I straight up asked her if I wasn't invited to her birthday celebration. She said that there's tension between me and one of her coworkers (of which I was unaware  until she said it) and that she didn't want me to attend to avoid drama. AITA for being upset that her coworker is getting the invite to her birthday party instead of me?\n\nEdit: This is not sponsored by her job in any way. There are other spouses, boyfriends, etc. going. The person with tension is not being celebrated for her birthday. They also get together and go out as a group at other times throughout the year without me so the primary reason I'm upset is because she doesn't want me there to celebrate her birthday.\n\nEdit 2: I asked what the issue was that caused the tension. My wife's response was the coworker (f) and her husband noticed tension with me during the last event that I attended with this group. I can't remember anything I said or did during that event that would cause tension so I'm assuming it's stemming from what my wife is saying about me while at work.", "created_utc": 1696332660, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ypf1f/aita_for_being_upset_about_not_being_invited_to/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How? Why?", "How is there tension with someone you\u2019re unaware of?", "NTA\n\nHow is this real?! To exclude your HB on your birthday because there's tension between you and a co-worker that you know nothing about?\n\nI'm trying to think of something that would make her do this. The only thing I can think of is that she has an affair with the co-worker.\nOr that she has a whole secret family.\n\nBecause in no universe would you pick a CO-WORKER above your husband.\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you.\nHas she had other occasions where she did something weird like this?", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t pick a co-worker over my spouse. Assuming you are all around the same age, you are grown adults and can behave as such. If anything she should have just asked you to be mindful and be civil around said co-worker. If my partner said this to me I would think that there is an ulterior motive. Not saying there is, but she handled this pretty poorly. It seems like you both need to communicate better to avoid going down that road. Ultimately she should trust you to keep it civil.", "NTA\n\nIs this co-worker a guy? She shouldn't be keeping you away from the co-worker. If the co-worker has a problem with you, then it is the co-worker's problem to deal with.\n\nYou need to ask your wife why she can't celebrate her birthday with you there when other couples will be there and keep pushing for a proper answer. It isn't normal behaviour. \n\nInsist that you go or surprise her at the venue. See how she reacts. For me, alarm bells will be ringing.", "NTA. There\u2019s drama between you and one of her coworkers that you\u2019re unaware of? That sounds like your wife is hiding something about her behavior at work.", "Nta and something is going on behind your back.

Her loyalty should be to you not to her coworker and it sounds like she's just making this up what is she doing does she have a secret boyfriend? I mean the facts aren't facting", "NTA but I suspect there is a larger problem.  The party included friends - does this mean arbitrary friends of people who work there? Did other spouses attend?

Very good chance your wife is looking to hook up with someone on her birthday party.", "Nta. There's a larger issue that even you may not be aware of. I would never prioritize a coworker over my spouse. I would never prioritize a friend over my spouse.

It doesn't make a lot of sense that she has not done this, and instead tried to get you to stay home. The whole scenario is \"off\" - something else is going-on. It might not be anything sinister.\n\nNTA. Why is she catering to this friend and not prioritising you? Either there is more to the story (all of her co-workers have an issue? I hope not) or the story is a cover.", "NTA \n\nShe picked your coworker over you ?!

Your wife is deliberately excluding you and choosing her coworker over you who isn\u2019t even having her bday on the day. Since other spouses/partners etc, are going it seems ridiculous she expects you to stay at home. Your wife sounds kinda horrible, I wouldn\u2019t put up with this. Maybe there are other underlying issues going on?", "NTA. Two people who don't get along can't be in a bar at the same time. Give me a break.", "This is very troubling. I would be asking some tough questions, such as, are you having an affair?", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s sus.. very odd", "NTA- but she\u2019s using the co-worker who \u201cdoesn\u2019t like you\u201d as a scapegoat.

Maybe an explanation will be forthcoming but she's not telling you anything about a significant part of her life, so just stop asking or caring about it. Maybe it's all a big misunderstanding but I would at the very least stop putting in any effort until you do get that explanation. You are essentially on break until then because there is never an excuse for not putting your partner first unless this co-worker was dying and she was the only blood donor available. She has changed the dynamic of the relationship and you can't change it back yourself.\n\n(Oh and if your birthday is coming up soon then book it just for yourself.

It  would be an easy one for me in her situation which is if someone I worked with had a problem with my other half then they also have a problem with me and that co-worker would be told in no uncertain terms that they get over it or don't come.\n\nIn your situation I would be having a very serious conversation with your wife over why they were chosen over you.  I would also want to know what the perceived problem the co-worker has with you and why she isn't defending you.", "NTA Why is she putting the coworker's feeling above her own spouse's?

Not some co-worker.\n\nIf a co-worker didn't like my spouse, they'd certainly not be invited to my birthday party, regardless of my spouse being there.\n\nI think something else is at play here.

Oh, well.", "Yeah she made it clear on HER birthday who she likes more between her coworker and her husband.", "When your partner choose whoever else than you, there is no partnership anymore.\n\nIt is even worse for an apparently innocent event.", "You are too blind to see.\n\nNot 8 just decisive.", "Did I say he couldn\u2019t ever be around them??  No.  I said he needs to find out what caused this tension.  This get together is not just about his wife.  This is to celebrate multiple people.  Sit this one out find what is causing this tension and try to fix it.\n\nLike I said I see why he\u2019s upset and I see why his wife is wanting to avoid the drama.", "Never mentioned op can never be around the coworker. But its wifes bday, the main invites are coworkers. Some of them bring their spouses along. If there is tension between an main invitee (coworker) and op and his wife would rather not have tension there, it makes sense op doesn't go. Sure, he can make a fuss about it, but at the end the only thing he would achieve is ruining his wifes bday, and thats not what you do if you love your spouse. \n\nOp seems to have difficulties with reading the room. He doesn't understand that when the event is organised by coworkers, the coworkers have priority over a tagging-along spouse. Also there are tensions with a coworker that are big enough to catch wifes attention and he has no clue about it and doesn't even bother to find out about it to fix things. That tells me op maybe isn't really aware if he is insensitive or accidently rude or just does not care and this can absolutly lead to more problems with more of her coworkers.", "Guess we\u2019re different I\u2019d ask her what the tension is about and what I can do to fix it.  So when there are future gatherings I would go and there\u2019s no tension.  You do you tho.", "That\u2019s a very mature reaction, jfc.", "Taste of her own medicine! \n\nWebAcceptable7932 and lihzee can stay being mAtUrE doormats.", "He'll probably make her leave a quart of her blood to sustain him while she is gone!", "Edited to provide more clarity. Not a work event, just coworkers that have developed friendships.", "Right???", "I asked what the issue was that caused the tension. My wife's response was the coworker (f) and her husband noticed tension with me during the last event that I attended with this group. I can't remember anything I said or did during that event that would cause tension so I'm assuming it's stemming from what my wife is saying about me while at work.", "Haha is he a hot guy?", "Or she just massively shit talks her marriage at work.", "If you're not going to explain yourself then F off", "Yeah, I mean, you were being super obnoxious by just going \"no u\" with no elaboration", "Exactly!!! \nI don\u2019t understand why people are downvoting your comment.", "Yikes, maybe it\u2019s that as a therapist I value opportunities to talk and grow, but that comment leaves zero chance for either. I, too, was put off with feeling like the wife chose her friend over OP, but to me that\u2019s what OP gets to talk through with wife. Jumping to divorce cuts out the chance to work through the underlying issues of this problem.", "You're right these people are not seeing it I see it", "*too", "Why should I care ?", "If there's tension between a co-worker and you, she should not invite the co-worker. I just can't wrap my head around this. It's insane what she's doing.", "Oh \u2026. Well seems like your wife is trash talking you at work. I would have a bigger issue with that then the birthday party.\n\nScrew those people \u2026. Ask your wife why their petty crap is more important than your feelings? Are these people adults? They can\u2019t sit at a birthday party in the same room as you? Either you\u2019re ridiculously unaware of your own behavior or your wife is not a fan of yours. She shouldn\u2019t be sharing personal information with her coworkers if they can\u2019t behave like adults.", "Then there's a big chance she lied about stuff and complained non stop, maybe even making things up, so much that the coworkers will find out her lies and you also would find out what she told them. \n\nThere's no reason as to why she wouldn't want you there besides some sort of self-preservation on her part. \n\nYou should try to find out the real reason as to why her coworker hates you so much.", "The bigger issue is your wife possibly trash talking you to her coworkers and choosing to spend her birthday with them over you.", "[removed]", "I made a reply with a funny categorisation, pick your choice ;)", "I replied to another comment with more explanation.\n\nI admit it was a bit rough.", "At the very least, this requires immediate marriage counselling, and if his wife is unwilling, I 100% agree with the divorce. \n\nMy wife would absolutely go nuts if I did something like OPs wife did, and for good reason. You NEVER pick a coworker over your spouse period. And OPs wife is doing it without even having an ounce of doubt.", "The wife did not explain beyond 'tension'. That's not a good enough reason for not inviting her husband to her birthday party. I agree with the dude above you. She's a WINO now, wife in name only. He's got the certificate but not the consideration.\n\nHe *gets to*, like some sort of prize? After that poor showing of support, it's entirely up to her to fix her mess. Or yes, realise too late when the papers show up. I wouldn't jump straight to it, but would visit a lawyer so he knows his options.\n\nI honestly don't see any excuse for it. The underlying issue is that he's not worth the effort to avoid drama with acquaintances. She's already failed to communicate why. It's sad that she managed to nuke her marriage in one night, but it's still lying by omission or her assuming he doesn't mind? I don't know what's worse. Does he even really need to know the various ways in which she prefers her colleague over her husband?\n\nShe disqualified herself from opportunities to talk and grow. It's all up to her now. He needs either a good explanation unprompted, or might as well move on.", "Yeah I am not alone !\n\nThx!", "yes my keyboard messed up.", "Either way, his wife is TA, for choosing co workers over her spouse, and for talking shit about her husband. I'm sorry I know a lot of people jump to divorce on this site, but I would demand she sit down amd have a serious conversation to explain all this, and request she attend marriage counseling with me and if she refuses i would have to recommend divorce.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Not the coworker? Can she not lay the law for both of them?\n\nSeriously.\n\nI may had been super high-speed fast forward.\n\nHe will confront her, she will be defensive and gaslighting, he will accept and resent, another red flag will appear, he will find out she was cheating, he will be broken and hate himself for not trusting his guts the first time, he will make another post  and I will say divorce.\n\nSo I short cut with divorce now.\n\nWell maybe you are half right, the reasoning was in my head, no one could see it."]}
