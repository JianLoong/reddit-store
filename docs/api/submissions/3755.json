We have already had to change our custody agreement because of her. Now I come to find out that she has been talking to my son about her beliefs and Jesus and all that and saying other concerning things to him.\n\nInitially I tried to be a good coparent and reached out to my ex. I asked him to talk to his wife. I said I don't care about his faith or relationship, but not to let it impact our child. He tried to talk to me about his own confusion about his beliefs and I basically said that we aren't married anymore (his choice) so I don't care. Talk to your wife.\n\nThat went nowhere. So finally I called her and told her to watch her mouth around my kid (I said it nicely in the beginning, but she didn't understand). She said she had a religious obligation to share her beliefs with others, and asking her not to was like asking me to eat pork. I was very offended by the comparison. I told her to back off from my kid, or she would be the reason her husband loses a relationship with his child.\n\nShe started crying, so I had to hang up. My ex called furious. I guess she called his mom asking for comfort. He told her about how his mom and I never got along and apparently thought his mom would side with her. His mom freaked out and called him to yell about him exposing our son to paganism (I know Christians aren't really pagans, but that's what she said). My ex and his mom had a big fight and apparently this is my fault, even though I'm not the one who called his mom.\n\nMy ex was furious with me for calling his wife. He said I just want to see him miserable and called me a bitch.

If it does, you have a legal point here and stepmother should back off. If it doesn't, tough luck, at dad's house the kid will have to observe whatever religion dad deems appropriate.", "NTA, it doesn't sound like the stepmother is trying to educate him about another religion. She just sees it as her responsibility to convert him to her beliefs, this isnt The Simpsons where an eight year old has that level of critical thinking.", "INFO: Was she trying to convert your son or was it just her explaining her belief to him?", "NTA she's proselytising to a child. No. She is not the child's parent and has explicitly been told to knock it off by a parent. It's gross behaviour.", "NTA...and it's concerning that she thinks her religious beliefs require her to push it on others.  I interpret that to mean your poor kid has 9 years of browbeating to join her religion in his future (as I've had a decent amount of personal experience with people like this).  It didn't mention in your post anywhere that your child is curious about her religion...it just says that SHE wants to talk to him about it.  And I'm sorry, but pushing another religion onto someone is a giant AH move.  It would be 100% different if he had questions and she was just explaining the differences...but again per your post, that is not what is happening.  Red flag on top of red flag.   It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to revisit your custody agreement to include something about not forcibly pushing your child to convert to another religion but allowing these things to be his choice.", "NTA. You are his mom and have just as much say about what he is taught. Not your fault the new wife went to MIL for comfort and got blasted as well. Who woulda thought trying to convert someone's religion would end badly?", "First off, the biggest AHs:  \n1. The new wife for not respecting the boundaries set by the kid's mother.   \n2. The ex-husband for not talking to his new wife about the situation, and for blaming you for the fight he had with his new wife.\n\nAs for the OP, you are NTA for wanting your kids step-mom to refrain from evangelizing them. That's just disrespectful on the new-wife's part, especially when she knows you don't want her to do that. I don't know if you have any actual legal recourse if a parent is evangelizing your kid, but it seems the best one would be to talk to your kid. They are going to run into this sort of stuff in their life and might as well use this as a learning opportunity.\n\nJust be sure you are as tolerant of other religions as you want your ex and his new wife to be in your daily life. THAT is going to have more of an effect on your kid than anything else in this situation.", "NTA. Stepmom sounds like an evangelical. Which means she believes anyone who doesn\u2019t share their beliefs is going to Hell. Yeah, a stepparent is overstepping their bounds if they teach a child that their parent is going to Hell. This is the exact reason we don\u2019t allow teachers to proselytize.", "Damn, didn\u2019t see that plot twist with his mother coming \ud83d\ude05. NTA. You had a deal. And all you do is to ask to honor it.", "NTA - it's not your fault. You asked your husband to have his wife stop trying to convert your son. When that didn't work, you went to the source. \n\nIf it were me, I'd escalate it further to family court and do whatever was needed to limit or stop your son's exposure to someone \"who has a religious obligation to share her beliefs\" aka convert new believers.\n\nI saw in your other responses that it's in your custody arrangement that your son will be raised in your religion. Call your lawyer, it's been violated.", "NTA. \n\n~~INFO:~~  How old is your kid?\n\nI see you answered someone else.\n\nI think you were fine to request she keep her religion away from your kid but since it already happened, I think a better reaction would have been to start teaching your kid about a bunch of different religions.  Maybe even poke fun at some of the oddities of them so that your kid can independently start analyzing the things they hear for themselves without necessarily being unduly influenced by them.", "NTA. You didn't cause a problem, you identified a problem and dealt with it. Even your ex's mother agrees with you. That should tell him to turn his anger where it belongs and stop her proselytizing.", "NTA \nBased on your comments; it seems like the custody agreement covered religion as well.  Step mom needs to STOP. She will be the reason your kid isn\u2019t going to be allowed around his dad anymore.  \n\nNgl, same thing happened when I was younger.  Mum wanted me to be open to things, step mom tried to force her religion on me.  \nSupervised visits with my dad until I was 10 lol.  She didn\u2019t learn until the courts told her to stop.", "NTA...  I'm going to assume from the pork comment that you are Jewish, as am I. I'm actually Jewish and an atheist. In my experience people who constantly talk about their Christian faith are not doing it in a casual or even in an intellectual way, particularly when it comes to children. In fact, Christianity always strikes me as particularly anti-intellectual, which is very very weird for a Jewish child.  There's way too much talk about salvation and hell, both of which are incredibly foreign concepts to your son.  Based only upon my own children they could have held their own with a Christian by the age of 9 but that doesn't make the experience pleasant or acceptable. To make matters even worse, when the 9-year-old wins the argument his stepmom will start screaming about how he is not respectful.  I hear it now, I might have a bit of baggage.", "NTA.  It is perfectly acceptable for you to request that this woman not discuss religion with your son.  Maybe you should consider going to court and curtailing your ex-husband's visitation rights.   \n\nI was raised in the Bible Belt of the US and heard so much garbage about religion on and on and on... I was raised Catholic, and in Texas.  I just kept my mouth shut and learned to say \"uh huh?\" or \"ok.\" and not really engage.  As a child/teenager I had no choice.  As an adult I will clearly say \"Hey everyone, time for a topic change!\"\n\nI have heard of other people say that they \"had a religious obligation to share \\[their\\] beliefs with others\" and I have been around other Catholics who share the same belief (also disgusting in my opinion).  Frankly I despise people who decide it is their obligation to verbally bludgeon me (or anyone) with their beliefs.", "NTA. She's pushing her belief system onto your kid against your wishes. If he was a little older and curious about Christianity, that would be different. But he's not and she was asked to stop.", "Info how old is your child", "NTA..its one thing for them to give general info about her religion..something totally different if stepmom is actively teaching him with intentions to convert him to Christianity. That is absolutely 100% NOT her place, i dont care what her religion is. At 9 kids are curious so maybe he asked particular questions etc, however, at the end of the day it's up to your ex and you, as his parents to decide (at this particular time) how to guide him in religion. Stepmom or not, there are some things you dont get in the middle of. Talk to your kid, see if he has questions or is curious about other religions. Answer his questions truthfully and without bias. That alone will go much further than trying to sway him one way or another.", "Absolutely NTA. it's your kid. You tried being nice.", "Nta. Christians think they can push their beliefs onto others even after you politely tell them you\u2019re not interested. Do the same thing to them and they\u2019ll do as the wife and start crying. They\u2019re your children not hers. I wouldn\u2019t want that belief system pushed to my child either.", "ESH\n\n\"A religious obligation to share her beliefs with others\" is why I'm atheist. Can't stand that noise.\n\nI was going to rule this as 'not the' but your other comments make it clear that you consider it your obligation to force the child to be your religion (and the father's and the grandmother's) instead of the step-mom's. Six of one, half a dozen of the other, from the point of view of an atheist.\n\nAt some point the kid needs to learn about religion and choose for himself. It seems like neither you nor the step-mom nor the grandmother want that. Poor kid.", "NTA you asked nicely then you talked to your ex  she disrespected your rules and boundaries her fault", "NTA.  I assume your son\u2019s religious education is part of the custody agreement.  Your ex\u2019s new wife is violating that agreement.  Off to court you go, with documentation!

Be careful.", "Info: What religion are you? and no a stepmother shouldn\u2019t be proselytising to your child without your consent with the goal of converting them, that\u2019s coercive and it sounds like it goes against your own beliefs.

I personally think \u201cspread the gospel\u201d is the most annoying part included in the Bible. Proselytizing is annoying and disrespectful to other people \nHOWEVER if your ex husband really has had a change of heart and exploring his religion he\u2019s allowed to talk to yalls son about it too.\n\nEdit: I saw your comment that the custody agreement included the religion. So yeah you\u2019re def in the right here", "NTA Just keep reinforcing every time you see him that Hell is not real and he doesn't need to worry about being tortured for eternity.\n\nEx might not care about finding a coparenting compromise with you, but maybe he'll listen to Mommy.", "NTA, I would tell my ex that it stops or I will be bringing this to court and will go for full custody. Don\u2019t speak to her again, everything goes through email.", "INFO: How old is your son? and what faith are you?Regardless, with the information I have, I want to say NTA. your child, your rules. I hate that Christians think they have to convert everyone. Freedom of Religion (if American) doesn't mean freedom to make everyone Christian, it means freedom to be whatever religion you choose that best fits your life or culture. (I am actually pagan because that is the faith I feel most comfortable being and respect the most. I would never try to convert anyone else to paganism. It's not for everyone.) All that said, if child is old enough and is asking her questions on their own, I don't feel like you should stop your child from exploring other possibilities. I do think it's awesome that ex-MIL took your side.  \n\n\nETA: As someone pointed out, father also has choices. I feel if dad wants to teach Christianity to child, that's another story. There are two parents in this equation and it is ok for a child to learn about different religions to make their own conscious choice, but I do feel like stepmom is crossing bounds by being the one to teach this.", "NTA The religious indoctrination of another person's child isn't on.\n\nAlthough fwiw, I believe all religions should be quietly forgotten, especially Christianity.", "Everyone who says yta is very dumb. People feel strongly about religions and kids are very impressionable. And in all honesty. If a mother says no I don't want you saying that to my kid. Then you don't. Period. NTA.", "It's hard to say because the nuance of the situation could involve many assholes.\n\nI'm leaning a little NTA because of my past experience with evangelical Christians.\n\nIt's one thing to expose kids to many different faiths and let them choose later in life, but that's not usually how evangelicals operate.  And I do think that you have greater rights to parent and protect a child than a stepmother.", "NTA - I am a huge supporter of teaching children about different belief systems and allowing them to follow their own spiritual path, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. The child is not asking the step mom about her beliefs, the step mom is proselytizing to the child. I have conservative Christian family members who think it\u2019s their moral duty to save everyone around them by bringing them into the faith. They are not open minded. They are not respectful of other belief systems.  The step mom will present things in such a way that makes the child feel that the only way to be a good person and go to heaven will be to follow her religion and beliefs. I have seen high school and college aged kids deal with guilt, shame, and worthlessness because they were told that they were going to hell for not being Christian enough. There is no way a 9 year old is prepared to handle this. If it was just learning about different religions, then yeah, but to defend against an adult in an authority position proselytizing to you and telling you that she\u2019s going to save you? No way. NTA. Get your kid out of that situation pronto.", "NTA. If your kid wants to explore other beliefs, he can do so at his own pace when he's inquisitive, he doesn't need new adults in his life proselytizing. \n\nYou have a written custody agreement that you and his father agreed to. His new partner doesn't negate that and if he feels strongly enough about it he can take the official steps to revisit the agreement. \n\nAlso I'm an atheist and I fully comprehend the difference between religion and culture but I think some people are forgetting that some cultures are defined by and rooted in religion.", "Obviously NTA. Your ex-husband's new wife clearly feels she has a responsibility to convert others to her beliefs, including your son. I'm personally never really clear on how to judge people like this. On one hand, they're not necessarily bad people if they genuinely believe in \"the word of God\" and so believe the right thing to do is to save as many souls as possible through conversion. But then can you say they're \"not necessarily bad people\" if they \"genuinely believe\" gay people should be imprisoned or killed and that scaring children with talks of hellfire is right? \n\nReligion is just a sticky issue because it can make otherwise NTA people behave in AH-ish ways. I'm not even sure what the legal position is on situations where one parent with custody is fervently religious and the other strictly anti-religious. \n\nBut in your situation at least, I think we can say that this woman really shouldn't be having anything to do with your child.

Coming from a Protestant turned atheist, I will say educating your child on religion is fine. Indoctrination is not. There are hundreds of religions, what makes yours so special? Why are you the only real religion, according to you? She should not be trying to force her religion, but neither should you. Educate not indoctrinate. Respect others right to religion or non religion.", "I'm going with a firm ESH for every adult in this situation trying to influence the child's faith instead of letting them make their own choices. \n\nFaith is a personal journey.

So here\u2019s what I would say\u2026\n\nIt depends on what the conversations are with step-mom. Your son\u2019s step-mom should not be telling him he\u2019s going to Hell if he doesn\u2019t believe in her religion or forcing him to attend her services. But at 9 (even at 6!) he is old enough to observe that she goes to a different place of worship, prays differently, eats food that is forbidden to him. He will naturally have questions. It\u2019s ok for her to answer with things like, \u201cThis is what my religion believes,\u201d etc. You cannot control what kind of information your son learns. When he\u2019s in HS he will be taking courses such as World History or Comparative Religions. Regardless, he is his own person and can/will decide for himself. My kid has decided she\u2019s an atheist. It breaks my heart, but I still love her and respect her choice. It doesn\u2019t stop me from praying for her.\n\nIf step-mom is being coercive, then you are N T A. If she is simply answering his questions, YTA.", "I'm going to say ESH.  Religion is such a touchy subject and I can't really tell from this post how in depth she is going.  I think it's ok if she is simply sharing what she believes with your son.  However, if she is trying to push those beliefs on him, as in telling him her beliefs are the right beliefs, that is a problem, IMO and if that is the case I would say NTA.", "I believe ESH (except the boy). \n\nI'm European. In third grade (which is your son's age) we had classes on Religious Comparisons. For a year we learned about several different religions, where they were initiated and how and where those religions expanded. \n\nI think that should be part of everyone's education, so they can make informed decisions about their faith later on. I also don't agree with baby baptism and other similar practices. Each person needs to make their own mind regarding their faith when they are old enough to form opinions.\n\nI believe you are AH because you are trying to prevent your child from knowing other religions exist (which is a useless endeavor anyway in the age of Internet).\n\nI believe the stepmom is AH because she is working to convert your son (because that's what her religion is all about). Also, for involving the grandmother. \n\nI think the father is an AH because he chose the worst way to handle the situation and the grandma is an AH for getting involved.", "You are N T A for not *wanting* your ex-husband's wife to talk to your kid about religion, but YTA for the amount of pressure you are applying to this situation. Your ex-husband has as much a right as you to educate your child about religion as he sees fit. I'll admit I find it weird that your ex's wife thinks its her \"obligation\" to educate the kid, but if your ex is ok with it you should come to an agreement of some sorts to head off a larger conflict.", "This is a hard one. I understand the fear of your child believing something different from you and being indoctrinated by someone you did not choose to have in your child's life. However depending on how old the child is, with any belief or knowledge, more is better so they can decide what they think for themselves. \n\nIt sounds like you and your ex need to establish some boundaries / a box from which everyone can operate within regarding religion. As this is about your child, I would not include ex's wife and if ex refers to her or says \"I don't think my wife will agree to this\" emphasize that this is for your child, and you two have his best interests not her.  Come to a consensus on what influences are okay for the child (can he go to church, church functions, temple, events of your religion, etc.) Maybe starting with what you would like him to do with your religion and then finding an acceptable comparable activity from ex's religion.\n\nMake it known at the end of the meeting that if actions are brought on by him or his wife that are outside of the acceptable activities, you'll be revisiting your custody agreement with a lawyer.

Enjoy the show!", "INFO: Do you talk to your son about your religion? Since you observe the custom of not eating pork, it sounds like he\u2019s exposed to it in at least some way.\n\nHonestly, YTA. There isn\u2019t any harm in sharing or teaching a child about any religion. Your child no longer belongs to a home with a single religion/customs, but two. A consequence of that is that he\u2019ll learn about other beliefs and grow up to make his own informed choices about which to follow, or neither, or something else, or even a mix. There are ways for you to have conversations with him about how they believe differently than you do, and the same goes for them.

Likewise if he chooses no religion.", "I'm leaning YTA because you haven't mentioned the kid's own thoughts on this.  If he's curious, you should probably let him learn about both religions and gain a wider worldview.  If you think it's doing emotional harm to him, making him uncomfortable or sad, or if the wife is being forceful, I can understand you intervening.

This question could be phrased am I a Hippocrate? Maybe if you do the same that this woman did yo your son to others and believes it\u2019s ok for you but not for others. Also at 9\u2026 your child is going to hear it and question it anyway. Last I checked religion is about having a spiritual connection to something higher than you that we aim to be. Usually I always hear how loving and caring and kind this religious figure be it God, Gods, Goddess, Door Knob, idk what ever it is that someone connected with\u2026 the idea I hear is to aspire to be this person by their teachings.", "A bit of both but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re responsible for a fight other people had.

You should be completely comfortable allowing your child to be open minded and free to hear about a lot of different beliefs. It won\u2019t hurt him unless they force him into something.

One of the most misogynistic ones, too. I didn\u2019t agree with his new faith at all but it\u2019s not up to me. I did ask the kids not be baptized until they were adults and could choose it themselves. The kids went to this religion\u2019s services for a few years.

You can't stop him if he wants to tell him about Jesus or take him to Church on his time, or wants to have his new wife do that.", "ESH. So your rights as a parent trump your husbands rights as a parent? Nope as co-parents, you have equal rights. Your religion is no more important than whatever religion your husband chooses to advocate. The sad part is that your child is caught in the middle of this.

Your son is nine years old, as long as his stepmother used an age-appropriate way of communicating, she did nothing wrong.\n\nYour son will be exposed to other religious/spiritual beliefs all his life.

This isn't a mother concerned about her son, this is a bitter woman using her son as a pawn in her personal petty fights with her ex's new Christian wife, and a controlling mother who doesn't want her son to have knowledge of anything besides what she preaches.

We have already had to change our custody agreement because of her. Now I come to find out that she has been talking to my son about her beliefs and Jesus and all that and saying other concerning things to him.\n\nInitially I tried to be a good coparent and reached out to my ex. I asked him to talk to his wife. I said I don't care about his faith or relationship, but not to let it impact our child. He tried to talk to me about his own confusion about his beliefs and I basically said that we aren't married anymore (his choice) so I don't care. Talk to your wife.\n\nThat went nowhere. So finally I called her and told her to watch her mouth around my kid (I said it nicely in the beginning, but she didn't understand). She said she had a religious obligation to share her beliefs with others, and asking her not to was like asking me to eat pork. I was very offended by the comparison. I told her to back off from my kid, or she would be the reason her husband loses a relationship with his child.\n\nShe started crying, so I had to hang up. My ex called furious. I guess she called his mom asking for comfort. He told her about how his mom and I never got along and apparently thought his mom would side with her. His mom freaked out and called him to yell about him exposing our son to paganism (I know Christians aren't really pagans, but that's what she said). My ex and his mom had a big fight and apparently this is my fault, even though I'm not the one who called his mom.\n\nMy ex was furious with me for calling his wife. He said I just want to see him miserable and called me a bitch. Am I?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You and your ex need to have a serious discussion about how to handle religion with your child going forward. If you had an understanding before, and he's having second thoughts, that needs to be a discussion between the two of you. If you need to, get someone to mediate involved. But there needs to be a solid understanding of the agreement, and it needs to be respected. Even in a perfect co-parenting relationship, the step parent should not be making big decisions like this, especially against the wishes of one of the other parents. It's unacceptable. \nHaving a solid co-parenting relationship between your ex and you is ideally what is best for your kid in the long run. Your ex should know that and ultimately want what is best for your kid. \nAlso, the comparison to eating pork is nonsense. Eating pork is a choice you make about your body that doesn't affect anyone else. I bet you're not running around telling people they have to stop eating pork or else be tortured for eternity either.

When it comes down to ethno-religions, what you\u2019re suggesting is essentially genocide. Look up cultural genocide. \n\nNo, \u201call religions\u201d don\u2019t need to disappear.", "You very much implied in your first comment that religion was the cause of the holocaust.", "I'm genuinely curious, how does that work? I thought going to the synagogue was more of a cultural thing for Jews who don't believe in God, but you mentioned you're religious", "You can\u2019t be an atheist and be religious. Religion is literally the belief in a supernatural power. Atheism is literally the rejection of such a belief.", "Comprehensively reading OP\u2019s replies to everybody else\u2019s comments is not in my job description, sorry.", "You don\u2019t irrevocably inherit a religion.  That\u2019s straight nonsense.", "I didnt tell you what your beliefes are.\n\nI can do for the luls if you want?\n\nAtheisim isnt a belief. Shouldn't you know that?", "Ok I see what you mean, I did agree with the original comment that did say all religions should quietly disappear, but I don\u2019t actually think that. I\u2019m sorry for being too vague with my initial comment and not dismissing that extreme. My stance is that people should practice their religions (or choose to not be religious) however they want, and leave others out of it. However, mostly they were referring to Christianity in the original comment, as they cause the majority of the problems in the present day, which wouldnt necessarily be genocide as it isn\u2019t a cultural or ethnic thing. I\u2019m apologizing again for anything I said that was wrong or offensive because I genuinely didn\u2019t mean to do any of that! Thank you.", "No? Synagogue is our house of prayer just like a church is. I pray several times daily, keep (mostly) kosher, observe Shabbat to the best of my ability, study Hebrew and Talmud, and follow the tenants and teachings of our faith.", "Once again: Judaism does not require a belief in god. Google it. You\u2019re not Jewish, you don\u2019t know shit about our religion.", "so you don't really give a shit about the answers and are here just JAQing off, got it", "Do you know what an ethnoreligion is?", "Judaism does not require a belief in God. I am an atheist because I do not believe in God. I am Jewish because my mother is Jewish and her mother before her and her mother before her and so on and so forth."]}
