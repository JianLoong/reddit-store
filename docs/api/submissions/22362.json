And what if you caught the guy and ended up with a knife in the chest. It\u2019s a fucking phone and she was stupid to not listen to you. Sorry dude but live and learn.", "NTA The Best thing to do in those situations is to prevent risks/walk away. You did the first and only logical thing. Chasing after him would have been fruitless if he had a bike and you were running and confronting him beforehand could have ended in violence which would have been much worse than losing a phone. Maybe work out with your wife a better way to communicate warnings, but other than that you did the right thing", "NTA\n\nHard lesson for the wife, but thankfully you have your phone. Sorry, the scenario made me chuckle, because who would do that?", "NTA. You gave her adequate warning and she chose to not listen to you. Actions have consequences", "YTA for being a smug asshole to your wife. \n\nCongrats on being right though. Is that moment of correctness going to carry you through a divorce when your wife is sick of being treated like this?", "NTA.\n\nI'm sure she's just angry and embarrassed. It wasn't EITHER of your fault. She made a mistake and a shitty thing happened. It sucks, but it could have been worse, you know?", "NTA- Some people want to learn the hard way.   \nInfo : I am curious pedal bike or motorcycle? Just so I can picture her suggestion of you running faster than a guy pedaling away or speeding away.   She\u2019s ridiculous", "NTA", "NTA. Seems like she's really embarassed about the full situation and is venting her frustration. Is there any way you can get it back apart from reporting it stolen or tracking it?", "NTA. Usually we learn as children not to trust strangers but I guess wifey missed that lesson", "YTA because of your reaction and complete lack of empathy. Really all you have to do is say you're sorry that happened to her, help her report the stolen phone, and make sure she remotely signs out of all her accounts on the phone. I'm sure she's learnt her lesson. But you just keep telling yourself you married a dumbass and how it's not your problem.", "ESH -- your wife for expecting you to be an action hero, but you for being callous. Yes, she did a dumb thing. Telling her that you warned her was rubbing her nose in it.", "YTA, not for declining to chase the phone thief but for being so cold about it after the fact.Playing StarCraft and saying \u201cyour fault for being an idiot\u201d is not a very caring response even if you think she made a mistake.", "You warned her, she didn\u2019t listen but then insisted you make the situation better for her. NTA. People have been killed chasing robbers. Why should you potentially risk your life for a phone?", "Did you really want a physical altercation with creepy guy, over a phone?  Safety first.  She's likely embarrassed over bad judgement. Also, lock your stuff up.  Sounds like your neighbors are sketchy", "NTA. Don\u2019t give strangers your possession without identifying them as a positive threat and DEFINITELY don\u2019t chase after the person.

Like what am I gonna do? Run faster than a guy on a bike?", "He said \"Don't give him your phone\", multiple times. She decided to be rude and act like she knew better and gave him the phone anyway.

Call cell company and give them claim number from police and you should be able to replace it with whatever deductible you have", "NTA  She refused to listen when you tried to warn her. If he was willing to steal from you after all of you saw his face there is no telling what else he might have been willing to do if you caught him.", "NTA. You were in a bit of a no-win situation, so don't worry about what you could have done. If you had stepped in front of your wife, she might have argued that you were patronizing her. You told her not to give him her phone, but she did it anyway, so how could you possibly be the bad guy?", "NTA-  not that I'm justifying the partners reaction but she just feels embarrassed and is (unhealthly) lashing out. Lots of 'open another beer leave her to it' comments and I think these aren't particularly healthy, either. I think a good approach would be to bring this up and communicate it is unfair that she is emotionally lashing out - but I think approach from a place of empathy and supportiveness. She's your partner; you're on the same team and it is a point where you can tackle it together", "Everybody knows\nThat the world is full of stupid people\n\nYou just get to live with one\n\nNTA", "NTA, Seeing how she reacted against you, I would separate for a couple of days, to give her time to think about how she took it out on you after ignoring the obvious danger of the situation.", "I'm not gonna say anyone is an ah but please try to look at it from your wife's perspective.

There's a lot of unknowns - are the neighbours nice?\n\n Someone she presumes to be a neighbour stops and offers to take a picture of everyone - this is quite a normal, nice thing to do. Her husband thinks something is off but due to all the other thoughts occupying her brain she doesn't pick up on the nuance of her husband trying to tell her that he thinks the man is dodgy. He just keeps saying he doesn't want a photo, which she finds strange since she does want a photo. When her phone is stolen her husband doesn't react. \n\nIn the aftermath she is scared and shaken. Is this what the neighbourhood is like? Have I brought my son and parents somewhere unsafe and unfriendly. There's so much to do and now I have to deal with phone theft on top of that. My husband thought this would happen but I didn't understand that was what he was trying to say. Instead of making her feel better her husband says \"I told you so\" and goes to play games - when there is still lots to do with looking after the kid and moving in the house and sorting out bills. \n\nSo try to be empathetic yeah.", "YTA\n\n\nYou cared more about smugly basking in being right than looking out for her.\n\n\nIf I let my girlfriend \"face the consequences\" every time she did something stupid, then I'd have a lot more arguments to deal with and you can bet I'd have a harder time on the many many future occasions when my stupidity will no doubt get the best of me", "You\u2019re the asshole because of the StarCraft line. Jesus Christ", "YTA.  Not for not chasing after the guy and not for not stopping your wife but you could have showed your wife some sympathy. It sucks getting robbed. \n\nI\u2019ve had stuff stolen when I wasn\u2019t as careful as I should have been, in those moments what I wanted was someone to commiserate with me", "NTA - I would also add a nice cold beer to go with your game and Reddit.

You tried to warn her. No use getting hurt or worse over her phone.", "NTA, but this is a sucky situation to be sure. I'm sure your wife isn't just upset at you in particular, but that you guys JUST moved to a neighborhood where her first experience with a local was theft. On top of that the embarrassment of being told not to do something that is fairly naive, and then having her phone stolen, and then in her frustration yelling at the person who warned her. She's probably stewing over a LOT of different aspects of the whole scenario.\n\nAnd then there's you, damned if you did, damned if you didn't. If you had stepped in front of her, physically prevented her from giving her phone, or yelled at her, you'd never hear the end from her about how you're awful and didn't know that guy, he was just trying to help, you don't trust her judgement, etc. And now that she went and made the mistake you told her not to make, you're catching flack for it.

I had to scroll too far to find a comment about OP\u2019s complete lack of empathy. \n\nYes, Brenda made a poor choice.

How many times in our life has something happened and our knee jerk reaction is to raise our voice emotionally? I doubt she was actually screaming at him, and almost surely yelling about things that could have been done as she was in disbelief.

I'm just making sure you're consistent in your ideals. \n\nWith that logic in mind then, I'd say both parties can be excused for their reaction to a stressful event. \n\nHe at least is showcasing signs of doubt and remorse in his title post so he clearly cares about his wife and her well-being. \n\nThis isn't the marriage ending event you think it is.", "\"Gaslighting is the subjective experience in which an individual's perception of reality is repeatedly undermined or questioned by another person.\"  \n\"Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that often occurs in abusive relationships.
