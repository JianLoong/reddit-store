And what if you caught the guy and ended up with a knife in the chest. It\u2019s a fucking phone and she was stupid to not listen to you. Sorry dude but live and learn.", "NTA The Best thing to do in those situations is to prevent risks/walk away. You did the first and only logical thing. Chasing after him would have been fruitless if he had a bike and you were running and confronting him beforehand could have ended in violence which would have been much worse than losing a phone. Maybe work out with your wife a better way to communicate warnings, but other than that you did the right thing", "NTA\n\nHard lesson for the wife, but thankfully you have your phone. Sorry, the scenario made me chuckle, because who would do that?", "NTA. You gave her adequate warning and she chose to not listen to you. Actions have consequences", "YTA for being a smug asshole to your wife. \n\nCongrats on being right though. Is that moment of correctness going to carry you through a divorce when your wife is sick of being treated like this?", "NTA.\n\nI'm sure she's just angry and embarrassed. It wasn't EITHER of your fault. She made a mistake and a shitty thing happened. It sucks, but it could have been worse, you know?", "NTA- Some people want to learn the hard way.   \nInfo : I am curious pedal bike or motorcycle? Just so I can picture her suggestion of you running faster than a guy pedaling away or speeding away.   She\u2019s ridiculous", "NTA", "NTA. Seems like she's really embarassed about the full situation and is venting her frustration. Is there any way you can get it back apart from reporting it stolen or tracking it?", "NTA. Usually we learn as children not to trust strangers but I guess wifey missed that lesson", "YTA because of your reaction and complete lack of empathy. Really all you have to do is say you're sorry that happened to her, help her report the stolen phone, and make sure she remotely signs out of all her accounts on the phone. I'm sure she's learnt her lesson. But you just keep telling yourself you married a dumbass and how it's not your problem.", "ESH -- your wife for expecting you to be an action hero, but you for being callous. Yes, she did a dumb thing. Telling her that you warned her was rubbing her nose in it.", "YTA, not for declining to chase the phone thief but for being so cold about it after the fact.Playing StarCraft and saying \u201cyour fault for being an idiot\u201d is not a very caring response even if you think she made a mistake.", "You warned her, she didn\u2019t listen but then insisted you make the situation better for her. NTA. People have been killed chasing robbers. Why should you potentially risk your life for a phone?", "Did you really want a physical altercation with creepy guy, over a phone?  Safety first.  She's likely embarrassed over bad judgement. Also, lock your stuff up.  Sounds like your neighbors are sketchy", "NTA. Don\u2019t give strangers your possession without identifying them as a positive threat and DEFINITELY don\u2019t chase after the person. They could be concealing a weapon you don\u2019t know about.", "The man in his comment says he told her not to hand over her phone there's no ambiguity there.", "Call 911", "Yes ! This !", "Ah yes because being screaming at your partner for a bad decision you made after they told you not to is totally fair and healthy thing to do.", "Bicycle.   \n\n\nAnd right!? Like what am I gonna do? Run faster than a guy on a bike?", "He said \"Don't give him your phone\", multiple times. She decided to be rude and act like she knew better and gave him the phone anyway. To no one's surprise, it was stolen. Does he really have to coddle his wife like a child because she doesn't listen to or possess common sense?", "The best part is when you catch up to him you have to fight him.  It\u2019s like a vigilante triathlon."]}
