And what if you caught the guy and ended up with a knife in the chest. It\u2019s a fucking phone and she was stupid to not listen to you. Sorry dude but live and learn.", "NTA The Best thing to do in those situations is to prevent risks/walk away. You did the first and only logical thing. Chasing after him would have been fruitless if he had a bike and you were running and confronting him beforehand could have ended in violence which would have been much worse than losing a phone. Maybe work out with your wife a better way to communicate warnings, but other than that you did the right thing", "NTA\n\nHard lesson for the wife, but thankfully you have your phone. Sorry, the scenario made me chuckle, because who would do that?", "NTA. You gave her adequate warning and she chose to not listen to you. Actions have consequences", "YTA for being a smug asshole to your wife. \n\nCongrats on being right though. Is that moment of correctness going to carry you through a divorce when your wife is sick of being treated like this?", "NTA.\n\nI'm sure she's just angry and embarrassed. It wasn't EITHER of your fault. She made a mistake and a shitty thing happened. It sucks, but it could have been worse, you know?", "NTA- Some people want to learn the hard way.   \nInfo : I am curious pedal bike or motorcycle? Just so I can picture her suggestion of you running faster than a guy pedaling away or speeding away.   She\u2019s ridiculous", "NTA", "NTA. Seems like she's really embarassed about the full situation and is venting her frustration. Is there any way you can get it back apart from reporting it stolen or tracking it?", "NTA. Usually we learn as children not to trust strangers but I guess wifey missed that lesson", "YTA because of your reaction and complete lack of empathy. Really all you have to do is say you're sorry that happened to her, help her report the stolen phone, and make sure she remotely signs out of all her accounts on the phone. I'm sure she's learnt her lesson. But you just keep telling yourself you married a dumbass and how it's not your problem.", "ESH -- your wife for expecting you to be an action hero, but you for being callous. Yes, she did a dumb thing. Telling her that you warned her was rubbing her nose in it.", "YTA, not for declining to chase the phone thief but for being so cold about it after the fact.Playing StarCraft and saying \u201cyour fault for being an idiot\u201d is not a very caring response even if you think she made a mistake.", "You warned her, she didn\u2019t listen but then insisted you make the situation better for her. NTA. People have been killed chasing robbers. Why should you potentially risk your life for a phone?", "Did you really want a physical altercation with creepy guy, over a phone?  Safety first.  She's likely embarrassed over bad judgement. Also, lock your stuff up.  Sounds like your neighbors are sketchy", "NTA. Don\u2019t give strangers your possession without identifying them as a positive threat and DEFINITELY don\u2019t chase after the person. They could be concealing a weapon you don\u2019t know about.", "The man in his comment says he told her not to hand over her phone there's no ambiguity there.", "Call 911", "Yes ! This !", "Ah yes because being screaming at your partner for a bad decision you made after they told you not to is totally fair and healthy thing to do.", "Bicycle.   \n\n\nAnd right!? Like what am I gonna do? Run faster than a guy on a bike?", "He said \"Don't give him your phone\", multiple times. She decided to be rude and act like she knew better and gave him the phone anyway. To no one's surprise, it was stolen. Does he really have to coddle his wife like a child because she doesn't listen to or possess common sense?", "The best part is when you catch up to him you have to fight him.  It\u2019s like a vigilante triathlon.\n\nEdit- I appreciate the silver! I\u2019d be to tired to win the fight for gold.", "And that's what insurance is for. Go online to your local police website. File a report of her being robbed.  Call cell company and give them claim number from police and you should be able to replace it with whatever deductible you have", "NTA  She refused to listen when you tried to warn her. If he was willing to steal from you after all of you saw his face there is no telling what else he might have been willing to do if you caught him.", "NTA. You were in a bit of a no-win situation, so don't worry about what you could have done. If you had stepped in front of your wife, she might have argued that you were patronizing her. You told her not to give him her phone, but she did it anyway, so how could you possibly be the bad guy?", "NTA-  not that I'm justifying the partners reaction but she just feels embarrassed and is (unhealthly) lashing out. Lots of 'open another beer leave her to it' comments and I think these aren't particularly healthy, either. I think a good approach would be to bring this up and communicate it is unfair that she is emotionally lashing out - but I think approach from a place of empathy and supportiveness. She's your partner; you're on the same team and it is a point where you can tackle it together", "Everybody knows\nThat the world is full of stupid people\n\nYou just get to live with one\n\nNTA", "NTA, Seeing how she reacted against you, I would separate for a couple of days, to give her time to think about how she took it out on you after ignoring the obvious danger of the situation.", "I'm not gonna say anyone is an ah but please try to look at it from your wife's perspective. She's just moved to a new area - this is exciting and a little bit nerve wracking. She has a lot on her mind thinking about what needs to be done while still trying to be excited about the house. There's a lot of unknowns - are the neighbours nice?\n\n Someone she presumes to be a neighbour stops and offers to take a picture of everyone - this is quite a normal, nice thing to do. Her husband thinks something is off but due to all the other thoughts occupying her brain she doesn't pick up on the nuance of her husband trying to tell her that he thinks the man is dodgy. He just keeps saying he doesn't want a photo, which she finds strange since she does want a photo. When her phone is stolen her husband doesn't react. \n\nIn the aftermath she is scared and shaken. Is this what the neighbourhood is like? Have I brought my son and parents somewhere unsafe and unfriendly. There's so much to do and now I have to deal with phone theft on top of that. My husband thought this would happen but I didn't understand that was what he was trying to say. Instead of making her feel better her husband says \"I told you so\" and goes to play games - when there is still lots to do with looking after the kid and moving in the house and sorting out bills. \n\nSo try to be empathetic yeah.", "YTA\n\n\nYou cared more about smugly basking in being right than looking out for her.\n\n\nIf I let my girlfriend \"face the consequences\" every time she did something stupid, then I'd have a lot more arguments to deal with and you can bet I'd have a harder time on the many many future occasions when my stupidity will no doubt get the best of me", "You\u2019re the asshole because of the StarCraft line. Jesus Christ", "YTA.  Not for not chasing after the guy and not for not stopping your wife but you could have showed your wife some sympathy. It sucks getting robbed. \n\nI\u2019ve had stuff stolen when I wasn\u2019t as careful as I should have been, in those moments what I wanted was someone to commiserate with me", "NTA - I would also add a nice cold beer to go with your game and Reddit. Her behaviour is what someone would call La loca. Leave her be, enjoy your quiet time and see if if any riots are possible in close vicinity. Riots are a good place to get free phones", "NTA she actively chose to do something that could at best be called: willingly naive. And more correctly:blatantly stupid.", "NTA", "NTA unless you\u2019re The Terminator.", "Ok, please tell me I'm not the only one picturing that guy who stole Chevy Chase's family's camera as they posed in front of that fountain on their European trip...", "Info: Did he have a licence plate?", "NTA, she made a dumb mistake.  You tried to warn her. No use getting hurt or worse over her phone.", "NTA, but this is a sucky situation to be sure. I'm sure your wife isn't just upset at you in particular, but that you guys JUST moved to a neighborhood where her first experience with a local was theft. On top of that the embarrassment of being told not to do something that is fairly naive, and then having her phone stolen, and then in her frustration yelling at the person who warned her. She's probably stewing over a LOT of different aspects of the whole scenario.\n\nAnd then there's you, damned if you did, damned if you didn't. If you had stepped in front of her, physically prevented her from giving her phone, or yelled at her, you'd never hear the end from her about how you're awful and didn't know that guy, he was just trying to help, you don't trust her judgement, etc. And now that she went and made the mistake you told her not to make, you're catching flack for it. There was really no winning in this scenario, man. Sorry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; That's rough buddy.", "NTA. She gave her phone to a thief after she disregarded your advice.", "NTA for what happened.\nWhy does your title indicate you have more than one wife and they all share one phone?", "NTA. She\u2019s just embarrassed how dumb her choice played in front of everyone.", "NTA, you warned her and gave her a look she should've understood that it wasn't a very good idea she shouldn't be surprised at the outcome.", "No it was completely her fault for giving her phone to a random person after  ignoring several warnings not to. \n\nfor her to then blame OP for not somehow chasing down someone on a bike and then probably having to get into a fight if he caught him is also ridiculous", "THANK YOU. I had to scroll too far to find a comment about OP\u2019s complete lack of empathy. \n\nYes, Brenda made a poor choice. But what does an \u201cI told you so\u201d attitude accomplish beyond upsetting her further?", "He is very smug, like he cares more about being right than anything else", ">when your wife is sick of being treated like this?\n\nLike a 37 YO child?!? I do agree with you though, HE should divorce this oblivious abuser!", "That's not the point. She knows you can't get the phone back. She knows she made a mistake. She also now knows her husband completely lacks any empathy in a situation where she's upset and went for the \"I told you so\" instead of the \"ugh that sucks, thieves suck\" option. You're the asshole.", "By the time you realized what was happening it was too late. Maybe you should've taken the phone as she was giving it to him.", "She\u2019s upset. Crying and emotional. Take a step back and realize that sometimes people misplace their anger. An appropriate response is not smug callousness. He\u2019s in for a short marriage.", "There is no abuse happening on either end here. Just someone dealing with something upsetting and their partner expressing how they don\u2019t give a shit about them.", "Knock him off it properly, and he won't be fighting anyone.", "Ironicman", "Or maybe she can take a step back and realise that you shouldn't treat your partner like that. You lay all responsibility for regulating their behaviour on him. She just gets a pass from you on behaviour that is completely not acceptable to your partner.", ">Take a step back and realize that sometimes people misplace their anger.\n\nHow likely would you be to say this if the roles were reversed and the husband was screaming at his wife for not springing into action?", ">Just someone dealing with something upsetting and their partner expressing how they don\u2019t give a shit about them.\n\nOh, but he did give a shit before said person had to deal with something upsetting them.   \n\n\nBro, you cannot be upset at the people telling you not to jump into a lion's cage, you hop in, get mauled and when people just don't feel the need to get mauled too, you're upset because nobody helped you... The f\\*ck?!?   \nAlso, what the dude is experiencing is abuse. Typical gaslighting! \"I have the authority do to what I want but when it comes to responsibility, well, my beloved husband, it's your fault because your awareness already foretold the results of my actions but by you not morphing into a discount Usain Bolt to fight a fight that could've been avoided if, AND ONLY IF, I would've listened to you, it's your fault!\"", "Purp tackle comes after the 1k bike chase.", "She gets a pass because all of us act emotional when something bad just happened to us. It\u2019s doubtful she truly screamed at OP. His callousness and arrogance will be the end of the marriage.", "Extremely. How many times in our life has something happened and our knee jerk reaction is to raise our voice emotionally? I doubt she was actually screaming at him, and almost surely yelling about things that could have been done as she was in disbelief. I wouldn\u2019t doubt this would be the same if the roles were reversed. This isn\u2019t a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment like you think it is.", "This isn\u2019t abuse and it\u2019s certainly not gaslighting. You would be well served to learn what these two things are with how flippantly you use these terms.", "Nah being upset isn't an excuse for that. You keep saying that after reading one post about this dude life kind of silly imo", "Fair enough, lol. I'm just making sure you're consistent in your ideals. \n\nWith that logic in mind then, I'd say both parties can be excused for their reaction to a stressful event. \n\nHe at least is showcasing signs of doubt and remorse in his title post so he clearly cares about his wife and her well-being. \n\nThis isn't the marriage ending event you think it is.", "\"Gaslighting is the subjective experience in which an individual's perception of reality is repeatedly undermined or questioned by another person.\"  \n\"Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that often occurs in abusive relationships. It is a covert type of emotional abuse in which the bully or abuser misleads the target, creating a false narrative and making them question their judgments and reality.\"  \n\n\nI don't know, man... I mean... it's right there... but hey! Maybe I'm too used to \"you should've seen it coming\" whenever someone gives me some good advice and I mess it up..."]}
