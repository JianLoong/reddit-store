She recently got a puppy but cannot for the life of her raise or train it. It tears up our cat's toys whenever her sister brings him over. I bought a scuf controller after I received a big enough paycheck, since normally I can't afford anything for myself. After the shipping the controller was around $230. I went to work while my fianc\u00e9e stayed home due to being sick. She asked if she could have her sister over and I said yes as long as she doesn't bring the dog. Well I get home and see her sister brought the dog over. They leave after a few hours and my fianc\u00e9e goes to bed, only for me to discover my controller busted and chewed up, no longer working. The next morning I confront her about it and she tells me that the dog got to it \"but only for a second\". I call her sister and ask if she could pay for the controller, as her dog has already caused several hundred dollars of damage before this. She rejects my request. Later my fianc\u00e9e became mad at me because her sister told her I asked her pay me for the controller, this has been an issue for months now and it seems everytime I bring it up, I'm met with the same response. \"Puppies chew on things, it's just what they do. Do you want the dog to pay for it?\" As well as ridicule. So I banned her sister and the dog from coming over again. No more of that nonsense.\nAt this point everyone is angry at me and saying how hateful I am for a \"one time issue\"\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to say this but I obviously don\u2019t expect the dog to pay for the controller, just the sister.", "created_utc": 1701457922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188ju86/aita_for_kicking_out_my_fianc\u00e9e_sister_and_her/", "score": 997, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They betrayed your boundary of the dog coming over with the sister. To think that no one has to pay for the controller is ridiculous. Either the sister, the fianc\u00e9, or the parents (the sister is a child being 16) need to pay you back for what was damaged. Frankly, the fianc\u00e9 attitude about this situation would have me rethinking building a life with her.", "NTA.\n\nYour real problem is your fianc\u00e9e - she could have prevented this or taken responsibility. Now she's blaming you for being upset? You need to wake up.", "Info: does the sister not have any type of part time job?\n\nAnyway NTA this is something you bought for yourself and that was destroyed by somebody else's animal (puppy or not t it is her responsibility to watch the dog). It's not ridiculous to expect that the sister either reimburses you or just orders another one for you as it is her puppy that wrecked your original controller. If she can't go to her parents and request they do either of the options as it is technically their dog that wrecked someone else's property. If the sister or parents have a hard time understanding explain that if you brought an animal over and it destroyed something of theirs (phone/computer/nice furniture)that you would either repay them for it or replace it and that they find themselves in the reverse of this situation. As for kicking them out you were well within your rights to do that.", "NTA\n\nYou set very clear boundaries.  They were violated.  Your property was destroyed.  You deserve recompense.  The fact that your girlfriend is mad at you for holding her sister accountable is not a good look on her.", ">Puppies chew on things, it's just what they do.\n\nThis is true, it's a fact you have to accept when taking on the responsibility of getting a puppy. You, however, did not get a puppy. Your GF's sister did, then she brought it over when you specifically told her not to. Nobody expects the puppy to pay for it, buy anyone in their right mind would expect the dog's owner to pay for it, because the dog is her responsibility. What does she think happens if her dog gets out and destroys someone else's property? The police will just go, \"Well, we can't press charges against a puppy.\" She signed a social contract when she got the dog, she needs to pay for the damage it caused. NTA.", "Run. You found out that your fiance will put her family first and take their side every time.", "NTA, lmao, In all instances where something yours (like a child or dog) that can't be responsible itself, YOU the owner (or parent) is the responsible one.", "Dude.

At this point, you also know that your fiancee doesn't respect your belongings either and you should act accordingly.", "NTA But your really marrying into this family?", "NTA, your gf is applying the same logic as if it was *your* dog but it's not. The owner is responsible. For the love of all that is holy though don't listen to all of these certified lunatics telling you to cold-ass break up over it. I swear to god the main mission of this sub is to prematurely end relationships. I think it's secretly run by a mysterious paranormal entity that derives its strength from unnecessary heartbreak.", "NTA i know puppies do that but your SIL is responsible for your puppy. For example, if your baby breaks something in a toy shop, you will be responsible for paying for it, even though its not your fault. make them pay back for ALL the damage, not just the controller, before you let them back", "Nta . But u should dump your finance as well . Honestly if your finance can\u2019t respect you things and can\u2019t respect things you say then she not the girl for you . You specifically told her to tell her sister not to bring the dog and she did . Your fianc\u00e9  should have told her sister to leave the dog home . If i were you I\u2019d charge a new controller on your her card and tell her to since she allowed the dog in house after you said no so then she is responsible for her sisters dog . Then you dump her after you get your controller . Becsuse I\u2019m\nSure this isn\u2019t the first time ur fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t listen and won\u2019t be the last . I\u2019m married and my wife respects things i say especially when it comes to things i don\u2019t like .", "NTA\n\nA one time issue that has happened several times and that they admit will likely happen again and again.

And their OWNERS are responsible for fixing or replacing what they break. NTA, but your fianc\u00e9 sure is.", "Pretty sure $230 is enough for you to take her to small claims court.", "I think you're pretty reasonable. Those controllers are dear and you obviously enjoy gaming too buy it. My puppy did that to a mates ps2 controller too at my house when we were teenagers. My mum had to fix them it's only fair. You can't expect everything to be a chew toy", "Nta good lord. Yes, puppies chew on things. It's up to the owner to be responsible and give the dog APPROPRIATE things to chew on \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. Obviously it is not a one time thing. Since it happened with other stuff and you let it slide. Now it is an item of expense and you want it replaced. Rightfully so!", "NTA  But you really need to get rid of the GF!", "Definitely NTA. Sister or her parents need to pay to recoup your losses. Your gf is a massive ah. She\u2019s mad at you because her sister screwed up. She enabled the mess by letting the dog over anyway.", "NTA. Neither of them were watching the dog and they are both responsible for the damage. \n\nThis is a sign of a larger problem. The fact that your fianc\u00e9e thinks it is no big deal is a huge red flag. You have been together for years, but it sounds like she is still lacking a lot of maturity. I have no doubt that you love her deeply, but is this something you can live with forever? You spent both the time & discipline of saving for the controller only to have it ruined. Instead of taking responsibility, the reply was a \u201coops, not my fault, talk to the dog\u201d What if this was a child breaking expensive things? Other people aren\u2019t going to let it pass. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about your controller. I can understand how it has to be a huge disappointment. Both in not having the device, but in the response you got when it was destroyed.", "NTA. Her parents or your girlfriend should pay for it. Or just throw her out too.", "Yes puppies chew things, so you watch them like a hawk, especially at someone else\u2019s house.    NTA.", "Why is the fianc\u00e9 blameless? OP said the sister could come over without the dog. Dog was brought anyway and fianc\u00e9 let the dog in. Does the fianc\u00e9 not agree with the no dog or is she spineless in the face of her family.\n\nTell fianc\u00e9 she let the dog in, she buys a new controller. If she doesn\u2019t want to pay, tell her to get it from her family. \n\nRethink the engagement. Not over the controller but the reaction to your reasonable expectation to be made whole.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI dislike dogs myself so I would be livid. If I had a dog, I would know I'm responsible for it. How immature.", "NTA, The owner of the dog is responsible for any damage it does to another persons property.  She owes you a co troller and you have every right to refuse re entry to your home u til,she replaces what her dog destroyed.  At the very least your gf should pay for it since her sister\u2019s dog did it after you said sister could visit but not the dog and she let the dog come anyway.", "NTA but Children marrying children", "If the dog needs something to chew it's on Sister to bring toys with her for the dog. Cuz that sounds like that's part of the issue.\n\nThat said- you told Fianc\u00e9e that the dog couldn't come over. She either didn't tell Sister that or when Sister appeared with the dog, she decided it was fine because she let the dog inside the house.\n\nIf Sister can't afford to replace the controller that's fine.\n\nBut you and Fianc\u00e9e need to have a serious talk about how to handle situations like this and who is responsible for the damage caused by their friends and family members. This time it's her sister's dog and your controller, next time it may be your friend's kid and her shoes. The obvious answer it, you're each responsible for fixing your friends/families screw ups (or getting them to pay for it.) It'll ensure that you are each more responsible when you have guests over.\n\nSo that would Fianc\u00e9e can decide is she replacing your controller (with the same one you had) or is Sister? And it doesn't count as your Christmas present.\n\nAnd if you and Fianc\u00e9e are gonna stay engaged- maybe get the Sister a gift certificate to puppy school for Christmas.", "Nope, NTA,  but you have a fiancee problem in that she sees no problems in her sister's actions.", "I\u2019d drop the fianc\u00e9e too if I were you NTA", "NTA.\n\nThe fiance and the sister are trash.\n\nRun.", "Nta  they are gonna walk all over you.

My dude I would\u2019ve wanted this replaced/resolved within days or bye bye \n\nseriously this really disrespectful take of your SO to be like ur things are not that important \u2026. \n\nTf NTA", "NTA. Yes puppies chew things, that's very true. But when that happens it's fully on the owner to replace what was damaged, end of story. \n\nShe wants to have an undisciplined pet, these are the consequences.

However your girlfriend needs to pay for the controller", "NTA!\n\nSister\u2019s dog damaged your belongings. Any decent person would be embarrassed & immediately reimburse you for your loss. Her sister is obviously not a decent person and I\u2019m wondering about your gf at this point as well.\nI don\u2019t blame you for banning sister & her dog.\nYour gf disregarded your request for the dog not to be in your place. Died she disrespect you often?", "lol at your edit \ud83d\ude04\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e should pay for it if her sister can't or won't, because you told her the dog couldn't come over and she ignored that.\n\nThey were careless of your feelings, destructive of your property, and they mocked you.\n\nNTA.  Are you certain this is the woman you want to spend your life with?", "NTA She was clearly in the wrong. The headline made me giggle, though, because it sounds like you're upset that the dog is also not buying the controller.", "Let me see if I understand:\n\nYou said sister can come over if she doesnt' bring dog, because he has previously destroyed property    \nSister was allowed to bring dog    \nDog destroyed expensive property    \nSister refuses to pay for it, Girlfriend refuses to pay for it    \nYou are the bad guy for asking sister to pay for it    \nall responsibility is being blamed on the dog    \n\ndid I miss anything?", "NTA however you cant ban her sister from coming over, and I think you should have gone to your fianc\u00e9 to pay for it before you went to her sister because your fianc\u00e9 is the one that allowed the dog to come over.

Perhaps you might benefit from taking a long hard look at this relationship.  Can you find a good time to sit down with your fiance and try to explain why you don't feel it's right to expect you to continue to cover the cost of damage caused by her sister's dog?  If you two can't come to some sort of agreement on this issue, that could be a signal of a deeper problem with your relationship.", "NTA although this was a preventable accident, you knew it could come over and you left the controller out, I don't even have a dog and mine lives in a draw.\n\nI agree she should pay for it, (is it covered by home and contents insurance?) and making the dog pay for it isn't absurd plenty of animals are internet famous.

Do you want the dog to pay for it?\" \n\nYes, and part of the choice of getting a puppy is taking responsibility for the things it chews on, piddles on, shits on, knocks over, tears up, breaks, bits, whatever.  So no, I don't want the dog to pay for it, I want the person responsible for the dog to pay for it.\n\n>  She recently got a puppy but cannot for the life of her raise or train it. \n\nAlso a responsibility of getting a dog.

She recently got a puppy but cannot for the life of her raise or train it. It tears up our cat's toys whenever her sister brings him over. I bought a scuf controller after I received a big enough paycheck, since normally I can't afford anything for myself. After the shipping the controller was around $230. I went to work while my fianc\u00e9e stayed home due to being sick. She asked if she could have her sister over and I said yes as long as she doesn't bring the dog. Well I get home and see her sister brought the dog over. They leave after a few hours and my fianc\u00e9e goes to bed, only for me to discover my controller busted and chewed up, no longer working. The next morning I confront her about it and she tells me that the dog got to it \"but only for a second\". I call her sister and ask if she could pay for the controller, as her dog has already caused several hundred dollars of damage before this. She rejects my request. Later my fianc\u00e9e became mad at me because her sister told her I asked her pay me for the controller, this has been an issue for months now and it seems everytime I bring it up, I'm met with the same response. \"Puppies chew on things, it's just what they do. Do you want the dog to pay for it?\" As well as ridicule. So I banned her sister and the dog from coming over again. No more of that nonsense.\nAt this point everyone is angry at me and saying how hateful I am for a \"one time issue\"\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
