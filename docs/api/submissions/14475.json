It's not uncommon for two people to have that between them and be in a non-romantic, non-sexual relationship. That's also your choice, much like it is for you to say no to these blind dates, and Mom is overstepping BIG TIME! You tell her to stop wasting the time of these men, unless she wants to date them. This is no longer a situation where passive actions will get you out, now you need to be firm and tell mom that if she won't respect you then she can consider your relationship damaged, because it already is for you.", "NTA\n\nThat's so messed up - not only did your mum set you up on a date when it was entirely inappropriate, but the rest of your family was sitting in the same restaurant. Even if you were looking for a date, it's not a spectator sport!\n\nYour mum is a real AH - why aren't you enough on your own? Why do you need another person to 'complete you'?

Also even if it were \"just a phase\" wouldn't that phase end on your time and not her's?", "NTA you were polite to Sam, who clearly didn't realize that he had been roped into your mom's continued scheming, and your mom got a dose of reality. Even if you were interested in dating but happened to be single at the moment, her approach was way too extreme. She needs to respect your boundaries.", "NTA, I can\u2019t even imagine being blindsided like that at a family dinner. Your mom has serious boundary issues.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like a doozy! As a mother myself, I can't picture ignoring my child's wishes when it comes to their personal life. On the other hand, many aro/ace people would still like a companion to spend their life with so, if you are someone who might like that, and if your mother just refuses to stop as per your wishes, and you don't want to cut her out of your life, maybe give her a challenge. Tell her you are more than willing to go on a date that she sets up AS LONG AS THE OTHER PERSON IS ALSO ARO/ACE. If she abides by those standards, it should be a while before you have to face another date and you, hopefully, will be meeting a like-minded individual that you may enjoy spending time with. Other than that, I can't think of many options considering she has begun blindsiding you with dates at restaurants.", "NTA.\n\nBut your mother needs to leave you alone.

I would care less my mom was angry with me, and more that I am going to limit contact with her until she can be more respectful of me.", "NTA Your mother put you in an awkward position and you are under no obligation to endure it for her sake. And that's what this all is, for HER sake. She's completely dismissing how you feel and crossing boundaries. If you find the one... that's in your time. If not, that's fine too. Not everyone has to be in a relationship with someone. That stigma has to go out the window.", "NTA - how is this even a question? \n\nYour body, your choice.", "NTA at all. I am neither aro nor ace, but if my family blindsided me with a family get-together-turned-date, I would still be upset. It was annoying enough when my own mom tried suggesting guys when I needed space after a bad breakup, but she does respect me enough to listen and back off. A date is something I prep for and do on my own terms one-on-one, and I'm someone who actually (usually) enjoys the things.\n\nI'm sorry that you've had to have this talk with your mom repeatedly, and I'm sorry that she refuses to respect you. It'd be hard, but in your place I would tell my mom I refuse to meet up with her for awhile, because I now literally could not trust her to not turn the event into another forced date. You are definitely NTA for simply wanting to spend time with your family without this level of belittling and disrespect.\n\nIt's also really sad when the rando she set you up with has more understanding and respect than she does, but at least there's one more good guy out there for the rest of us. You 2 handled this awkward situation with more grace than many. Best of luck, OP!", "You are not the asshole for your mom ignoring your desire to be asexual. That's on her.", "NTA.

Now I'm a year away from 40 she's... still not great.  But she tries to pull that sort of shit with me a lot less often.
