It's not uncommon for two people to have that between them and be in a non-romantic, non-sexual relationship. That's also your choice, much like it is for you to say no to these blind dates, and Mom is overstepping BIG TIME! You tell her to stop wasting the time of these men, unless she wants to date them. This is no longer a situation where passive actions will get you out, now you need to be firm and tell mom that if she won't respect you then she can consider your relationship damaged, because it already is for you.", "NTA\n\nThat's so messed up - not only did your mum set you up on a date when it was entirely inappropriate, but the rest of your family was sitting in the same restaurant. Even if you were looking for a date, it's not a spectator sport!\n\nYour mum is a real AH - why aren't you enough on your own? Why do you need another person to 'complete you'?

Also even if it were \"just a phase\" wouldn't that phase end on your time and not her's?", "NTA you were polite to Sam, who clearly didn't realize that he had been roped into your mom's continued scheming, and your mom got a dose of reality. Even if you were interested in dating but happened to be single at the moment, her approach was way too extreme. She needs to respect your boundaries.", "NTA, I can\u2019t even imagine being blindsided like that at a family dinner. Your mom has serious boundary issues.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like a doozy! As a mother myself, I can't picture ignoring my child's wishes when it comes to their personal life. On the other hand, many aro/ace people would still like a companion to spend their life with so, if you are someone who might like that, and if your mother just refuses to stop as per your wishes, and you don't want to cut her out of your life, maybe give her a challenge. Tell her you are more than willing to go on a date that she sets up AS LONG AS THE OTHER PERSON IS ALSO ARO/ACE. If she abides by those standards, it should be a while before you have to face another date and you, hopefully, will be meeting a like-minded individual that you may enjoy spending time with. Other than that, I can't think of many options considering she has begun blindsiding you with dates at restaurants.", "NTA.\n\nBut your mother needs to leave you alone.

I would care less my mom was angry with me, and more that I am going to limit contact with her until she can be more respectful of me.", "NTA Your mother put you in an awkward position and you are under no obligation to endure it for her sake. And that's what this all is, for HER sake. She's completely dismissing how you feel and crossing boundaries. If you find the one... that's in your time. If not, that's fine too. Not everyone has to be in a relationship with someone. That stigma has to go out the window.", "NTA - how is this even a question? \n\nYour body, your choice.", "NTA at all. I am neither aro nor ace, but if my family blindsided me with a family get-together-turned-date, I would still be upset. It was annoying enough when my own mom tried suggesting guys when I needed space after a bad breakup, but she does respect me enough to listen and back off. A date is something I prep for and do on my own terms one-on-one, and I'm someone who actually (usually) enjoys the things.\n\nI'm sorry that you've had to have this talk with your mom repeatedly, and I'm sorry that she refuses to respect you. It'd be hard, but in your place I would tell my mom I refuse to meet up with her for awhile, because I now literally could not trust her to not turn the event into another forced date. You are definitely NTA for simply wanting to spend time with your family without this level of belittling and disrespect.\n\nIt's also really sad when the rando she set you up with has more understanding and respect than she does, but at least there's one more good guy out there for the rest of us.

Now I'm a year away from 40 she's... still not great.  But she tries to pull that sort of shit with me a lot less often.  I think the closer it gets to my body no longer being a erm... viable vessel... the closer she is to accepting it's not happening.\n\nAnd NTA, btw", "She may not have the right temperament, but something my Mom has done is \"grandma\" for kids in her church who don't have extended family for one reason or another? \n\nMy mom however has never given me any grief about not getting literal grandkids, nor has she tried to shoehorn me into a bad romcom against my will!", "The desire to be sexual or not be sexual at all stems from biology. That's not hard to understand unless you refuse facts and won't budge from getting offended you thought (incorrectly) I meant it another way.", "Nta,\n\nMore parents trying to force their adult child to be something else. No one knows the future, you or your mom. But accept the people you love for who they are now.", "YAAY FOR EDITS! Your mom sounds like a narcissist doe. Who lies like that just to get sympathy?", "NTA: Your mom needs to accept that you don\u2019t want a relationship, goddamnit.", "Your mom is a habitual line stepper! Set a boundary. Tell her never to set you up again.", "Hi", "Hi", "Hi", "Nta", "Nta .. not up to her.. but I hope things go well with \"sam\"", "NTA!! Your mum knows who you are and what you are. You\u2019ve established disinterest in dating to her. She did not respect that. Your are fully justified in your actions because your own mum did not show respect to you.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like low-contact with your mum is the best idea. Maybe you and Sam will be friends, and you can be his wing person! Unless he's Ace, too.\n\n Seriously, my mum always nags about who I \"should have married,\" because I'd be rich, now.  I'm also Aro/Ace, much older, and way over it, too.", "A romantic soulmate might be what your mum thinks is necessary for a 'complete' life", "Being asexual isn\u2019t a \u201cdesire\u201d lmfao. I\u2019m demi & there have been times in my life when it would\u2019ve been easier if I wasn\u2019t. Saying it\u2019s a desire makes it sound like a choice.", "I'm just assuming I won't ever tell my family.  They were mildly homophobic until my cousin came out, they don't really understand or believe in gender dysphoria and trans people.  Trying to explain I'm aro is too much of an ask.  I'm just going to let them continue to think I'm \"too traumatized\" from past failed relationships to ever date again.", "You may find a platonic partner/companion one day or you may not, but you are a complete person with or without another.", "Why would you copy half a comment from someone else?", "... you gonna tell someone who is gay that they have a \"desire to be gay\"? Or a lesbian that they have a \"desire to be lesbian\"?\n\nIt's a sexual orientation and nobody has a \"desire\" to be their sexual orientation, just like nobody has the desire to be their gender or their nationality or their age, they just are.\n\nCalling it a desire is denigrating and invalidating, it's insulting.", "Honey I\u2019m 60 years old and I\u2019ve long given up on the soulmate BS. I don\u2019t believe there is someone for everyone, I don\u2019t believe in soulmates and the only problem I have with dying alone is that the cats might freak out. You have your whole life to live and enjoy. (NTA)", "I think in the aroace community it's called a QPR - queer platonic relationship. I've recently acknowledged being aro in therapy and that's one of the things that people often don't acknowledge - aromantic (and/or asexual) people aren't emotionless and isolated, they can and do have meaningful relationships, just not a typical romantic partnership. \n\nYou are a whole person with a complete spectrum of emotions - you're a perfectly normal human.  Your emotions and needs are just channeled a little differently than most people.", "If you haven't already, I encourage you to read [don't rock the boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/). I found it helpful when dealing with someone who weaponizes their response to criticism.", "Let her freak out and cause a scene. You don't reward toddlers for their tantrums, you ignore them until they calm down and can talk like a human again.", "I always laugh when people say aroace people are going to hell.  Like...priests and nuns are celibate.  Why is my choosing to not have sex or be in a relationship sinful?", "Umm?? Yikes????", "Great! Now please don't tell your mom about it, or she will interpret this as another date, and blast to everyone in the family that this was her doing, and you have to thank her for knowing how to pick \"the right person\" for you...", "I went ahead and gave her your cell phone number....:\"", " Doesn't matter if its dating or more intimate matters.", "Bots- they get enough karma to have a history and pass as a person at a glance, then start shilling. You can report them, it's Spam>Harmful Bots.", "I was going to ask about mum\u2019s relationship status too.", "Thanks for saying this.  I'm 54, divorced and come to this conclusion as well.  I'm happiest on my own.", "I think that is one of the best things I\u2019ve ever read. So accurate.", "First, ten out of ten for you and your associates\u2019 choice of username.\n\nThe \u201cproduct of their time\u201d drives me nuts now, because I\u2019m the same-ish age as OP\u2019s mother, and GenX has no excuse for not having at least some grasp of this sort of thing. Even if someone struggles with aro/ace\u2026 we spent our twenties having stuff like *Priscilla* as our pop culture landscape. \u201cNot everyone is straight and wants to settle down and have kids\u201d is not exactly the novel idea for someone my age.", "I hear you can just buy magic dicks online these days. Any size, shape or color!", "There's a slight mixup of terms going on here. Being asexual isn't the same as being single, it's a lack of attraction. \n\nOP desires to be single, but they *are* asexual. Just like you can desire to eat, but you don't desire to be a creature that needs food, you just are.", "You are the first to get the reference! Thanks. I'll let my associates know.\n\nI get what you said, but genX was also the last gen to go more conservative with age, and I genuinely don't mean to disrespect you, but most people your age didn't really learn the lessons.\n\nThe truth is the landscape of identities has changed a lot since my 20's (millennial nearing 40), and I get that it's a bit daunting at times. But the seeds have always been there, respect is the key, tolerance the path, acceptance the destination. You can't force people to walk the path, only point towards it.\n\nSadly the scene today is a lot of people rejecting the notion that there is more to life than what they know.", "Dishwasher safe!", "That specific comment of mine was in response to what's her face space something jumping to conclusions suggesting people can't turn off being gay just because they have a desire."]}
