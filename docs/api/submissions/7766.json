{"id": 7766, "submission_id": "10ge6vj", "title": "AITA for not giving my daughter her education fund money?", "selftext": "I (54M) have two children (23F and 21M) with my wife (52F). When the kids were young, my parents set up education funds for both of them, which was very generous of them.\n\nMy wife and I always expected our kids to attend college and then graduate school, as we have done. I have a PhD, my wife has a master's. Because of this, we decided not to use the funds for our kids' undergrad degrees and did not tell them about the money.\n\nMy daughter has always been more into the liberal arts, while my son is more of a STEM guy. My wife and I worried about her ability to find a job, but she insisted on studying music and film in college. She was accepted to some top schools and chose to attend a rather expensive one, but she had scholarships to cover almost all of her tuition. Everything else, plus living expenses, was her responsibility. She lived in a very small apartment shared with friends in a not-so-nice area far from campus, but she was fine and learned how to budget effectively. After graduating, she luckily found a job that doesn't pay extremely well but she enjoys, and scrapped the idea of grad school.\n\nMy son decided to do engineering, and he also expressed that he had no interest in grad school. My wife and I were disappointed, but accepted it since at this point he is already all set up with a very good job when he completes school. Since he did not receive as many scholarships as his sister, we decided to use his education fund to cover his tuition and living expenses. He was able to get a large and nice apartment of his own close to the school, which is important since his classes are so demanding and he needs a comfortable space to work.\n\nMy daughter was confused and asked how he could afford this, and he told her about the education fund. She called us and asked why she didn't have one, and we told her she did, we just didn't use it because we hoped she would attend grad school. She seemed hurt by this and asked if there was any way she could have the money now. We explained that there would be a fee to simply withdraw the money for non-education uses, and if we chose to do that it would belong to her grandparents so they could put it towards their own use. She's been quiet and short when answering our texts, and hasn't answered our calls at all since then. I know that it seems unfair to her, but it's not really her money in the first place and she's no longer in college. Plus, her brother only received it for educational purposes and it wouldn't be right for her to just have it to spend now. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I understand the consensus is that my wife and I are the AH. I texted my daughter to ask if she wanted us to withdraw the money for her/what she wanted to do. This was her response: \"I don't care. Maybe they can transfer it to \\[other grandkid who is 5\\] if the fee is seriously too much. Idk about grad school I haven't thought about it much recently. If I do apply it wouldn't be for another couple years and I hadn't been counting on having any financial help in the first place so it really doesn't even matter.

Your son attended college with no scholarship. You chose to not let your daughter use her college fund for everything that her scholarship didn\u2019t cover and you let your son use his for everything. The college fund you said \u201cwasn\u2019t even her money\u201d but isn\u2019t yours either!! What exactly do YOU plan to do with HER college money? YTA FOR THIS.", "YTA. You need to pay her back for the money she spent on her education, which her grandparents tried to ensure that she wouldn\u2019t have to do. \n\nAlso, info: what happens to the money now that you\u2019re not giving it to her?", "YTA.  I assumed this would be the classic \"my kid didn't go to college and wants their college fund\" - but it isn't even.  Neither child went to grad school, but you decided to give money to one but not the other, so it's not even about grad school like you pretended.  You basically decided your daughter's goals didn't meet your approval so you didn't give her the money that had been set aside for her.", "Do you know why all that you did seems unfair to your daughter? Because it is unfair to your daughter. You had the ability to use the funds to cover her living expenses during undergraduate. (This, of course, is a bit bizarre. Are you a trustee of a trust? Or did the grandparents set up a 529 plan and give you full control over it.) Yet you did not even tell your daughter about these funds. Talk about a faithless trustee.\n\nAt this point, you need to grovel. You need to apologize for substituting your judgment as to the best way to use the funds for your daughter's judgment. You need to make amends. Then you need to circle back and see what the terms of your parent's bequest were. (And, honestly, I'd get an attorney to do this for you as you've already demonstrated your judgment is beyond suspect.) Most trusts have provisions for disbursement of the corpus if the purposes cannot be fulfilled. I doubt, honestly, though, that your parents meant for their gift to be returned to them in the event that their grandkids didn't go to college or in the event that they didn't need the money for college.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the favoritism. You use the funds for your son to enjoy a cushy life during his undergraduate studies but didn't do the same for your little girl? Really? Seriously?\n\nIn case there was any doubt, YTA truly and completely.", "YTA you paid for your son\u2019s living expenses out of the fund but not your daughter\u2019s when they made the same decisions. Yet your daughter achieved scholarships and your son didn\u2019t, so you make her effectively struggle and have to pay for herself\u2026 whereas your son didn\u2019t achieve those scholarships, nor covered his own expenses, nor had to live in a lower standard because you favoured him and allowed him the fund. I wouldn\u2019t want to talk to you both either after making me work harder than my brother when the funds were there to make a difficult time easier. What do their grandparents think about how you\u2019ve treated them?", "YTA oh dear, just goes to show you that having PhD and a Masters does neither make you a good parent or smart in anyway.", "YTA she had an education fund set, went to school, and you chose not to give it to her. How can you not be TA???", "YTA. You stiffed her because you didn't like her field of study. Also, as someone who has a MS in a STEM field and only made about 35k annually after graduating with it, your obsession with grad school is weird", "YTA and Im surprised between your PHD and Masters degrees you couldn't figure that out.", "YTA many time over.\n\nI'm so mad.\n\n\"She lived in a very small apartment shared with friends in a not-so-nice area far from campus\"\n\n\"He was able to get a large and nice apartment of his own close to the school,\"\n\nno wonder she's upset with you. look how she sacrificed to go to school and you hand everything to your boy .", "You\u2019re most definitely the asshole here. Even if you don\u2019t clearly favor your son (You do, BTW), she thinks that. You penalized her for getting more scholarships. \n\nShe hates you now, and you deserve it.", "YTA. Omg, definite favouritism, and she might have chosen to go to grad school if she had the funds. Struggling through college is a very different experience to the one your son had. Insane.", "Yta. You penalized your daughter for doing well and getting scholarships and for not pursuing the education YOU deemed acceptable. You allowed her to live in a not so great area and  struggle for everything that wasnt funded by her scholarships rather than use HER education fund for her education. But your son you opened up the piggybank so he could have a nice apartment and no tuition or expense worries. You are no better than a thief and a misogynist too. Your blatant favoritism sucks and I wouldn't blame her if she cuts you off. IT WASNT YOUR MONEY ITS HERS. Pay the penalty out of your own pocket and give her the damn money that she was entitled to.", "YTA. Be honest with yourself that you simply didn\u2019t approve of her choices and this influenced your decisions. The fact that you were happy that your son had a comfortable and safe apartment to accomplish his studies, while your daughter lived in a shit hole in a \u2018not so nice neighborhood\u2019 and was saddled with a long commute, speaks volumes.", "Yta. Your parents set up education funds for your children. Not you. They are EDUCATION funds not post grad funds. This isn\u2019t your money to decide what to do with and she was deserving of it from the minute she enrolled in college. You made your daughter struggle for 4 years because you didn\u2019t view her wants for her future as \u201cgood enough\u201d because she didn\u2019t get a phd like you did. Give your daughter the money and let her pay of her student debt that she definitely has because of you. It\u2019s her money not yours.", "INFO:  what do the grandparents have to say about this? Since it's their money after all", "Of course YTA. It was money set up for her to use for her education. Not education you deemed fit.", "YTA - your daughter worked hard to get a top college scholarship and the money was set aside for HER by her grandparents, why do you think you get to decide whether her career choice is worthy enough of financial assistance? \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if she cuts you off if your favouritism is this blatant.\n\nYou said you hoped she would attend grad school, your son didn\u2019t but he still gets to use his fund?", ">\"Since he did not receive as many scholarships as his sister, we decided to use his education fund to cover his tuition and living expenses.\"  \n>  \n>\"Plus, her brother only received it for educational purposes and it wouldn't be right for her to just have it to spend now.\"\n\nYTA You're being dishonest, and I do believe it's intentional. You didn't use the money only for your son's education costs, you covered his living expenses. But she was forced to cover her living expenses, also you glossed over it but it sounds like she was stuck paying for part of her education (whatever the scholarships didn't cover) as well. There's no way you don't already understand how wildly unfair this is.\n\nAnd why do you make it sound like she's being punished for receiving so many scholarships? Is this just about you being angry she didn't pursue a field you prefer? And did you ever even consider that if she knew she had access to money to cover grad school that would have changed things?\n\nIf you care about treating your children fairly, which clearly is not the case, then the solution is obvious. Reimburse her for all the living expenses and education costs she was forced to cover. And stop pretending you're not blatantly favoring your son, because everyone here sees right through this nonsense. But you're not going to do that, because you clearly don't care, and for whatever reason, punishing your daughter for some unknown reason is more important to you than having a relationship with her.\n\nI do wonder what this is all really about. Are you maybe planning to keep that money for yourself to use down the road? That would explain why you never told your daughter it even existed and are fighting so darn hard to prevent her from ever touching it.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2018re favoring one child over another and leaving her with a HUGE disadvantage simply because she developed her own interests and chose a career path that suits her even if YOU don\u2018t like it.\n\nIt seems like you don\u2019t have your children\u2018s best interests at heart, you only care about projecting your ideals onto them.", "YTA through and through. You've literally punished your daughter for her choice of school and program. She was able to get a scholorship to a top tier school (so clearly she is smart and has great grades), she rented an appartment with friends in a bad neighbourhood (which you seemed to think was acceptable), she graduated and got a job she loves and you've decided to punish her life choices by keeping the money her grandparents put aside for her education because you didn't like the field she was going into. \n\nThat money was for her an her education, unless her grandparents put a clause that it was for grad school, you had NOT RIGHT to dictate how the money was to be used for school.\n\nYou are both terrible parents to your daughter. You chose to favor your son and his choice of education over your daughter's. Way to permanently harm your relationship. And not only that that money belonged to her, she should have it and any fees to be paid because of the withdrawl are on you to pay.", "YTA - Your parents set up the fund to help their grand kids attend college. The fund wasn't a cudgel for you to use on them. I'm a STEM guy, with the appropriate snobbery, but your distain for the liberal arts comes through loud and clear. (And your ignorance of their value.)\n\nAgain, the grandparents set up the fund to help your kids through college, not as a bullhorn for your academic prejudices.", "YTA. Hopefully she is able to talk to the grandparents and let them know what you did to her and they will force you to give her the money they set aside for her.", "Absolutely YTA. You treated your two children completely differently, apparently because you approve of the major your son chose and not your daughter. You should have either used it for both of their undergrad degrees or neither. Also, did their grandparents say the money was just for graduate degrees? Because if not, you're even more of an AH.", "Wow. I\u2019m at a loss for words\u2026I mean, **YTA**, _obviously_, how you think you\u2019re not is another question I guess. \n\nThis was a diabolical thing to do. You _clearly_ favour your son, that\u2019s apparent from this post alone, so I dread to think how your daughter has been made to feel. \n\nWhat are the grandparents thoughts on the matter? Because I think it\u2019s their decision now.", "YTA - this isn\u2019t your money. Your daughter should have been made aware of the fund when she started school and been given the opportunity to use it then.", "YTA.   Just admit that (a) you like your son more and (b) you are punishing your daughter because you personally don't agree with her choices.\n\nAnd I can't believe this is the 2nd time today that I've predicted the \"my daughter won't speak to me or let me see my grandkids and I don't know why\" post in the future, but I see this one coming from a mile away.", "YTA - AND incredibly elitist snobs.  Your Daughter DID get and education AND a job.  The money was HERS for education expenses, ie. living and school.  NOW you tell her she can't be given the money? YET, you have given your son his funds, because you agree with his major?\n\nWithdraw the money, send it to your daughter, AND PRAY that she lets you back in her life.  Good Lord, you are horrible parents!", "YTA. You're playing favorites,  and that favorite is clearly your son.", "YTA, it's not even your money. Your parents left money for your kids and you give it to one and withheld it from the other. That's messed up. If I was your parents who gave the money I would be really mad at you.", "So very YTA.  Daughter covered the difference herself because she had to, when son got $ handed to him for a cushy undergrad experience?\n\nThat is so unfair.  I bet the grandparents would be ashamed of you two.  \n\nJust goes to show degrees, book smarts, and snobbery don't predict emotional intelligence. \n\nSource: hubs and I have master's degrees, but our daughter is studying a trade.  WE FULLY SUPPORT HER CHOICE, and we're using her \"college\" fund to pay for it.", "YTA. This is obvious favoritism.", "YTA for keeping the fund a secret from your daughter. It might have figured in her choice of career had she known in advance that graduate school was an option.", "YTA, you should have set her up in a nicer place as well. It feels like because she didn't pursue some degree that you deem worthy, you just kept the money from her.", "YTA. You gave your son his money to cover his living expenses, not just his education, while purposefully withholding your daughter's funds and watching her struggle. You're hypocrites, liars, and shitty parents. Neither of your children lived up to your arbitrary expectations, so why are you only punishing your daughter? Give your daughter her money and count yourselves lucky if she doesn't cut you out of her life completely.", "So your parents set up education funds for your children and YOU decided that it should be used for graduate school. Also, YOU decided to withhold this information.\n\nThen your daughter gets into top schools and gets Scholarships but you still don't tell her about the money. However, you did give access to the money for your son, who didn't get such scholarships.\n\nNow you are asking how could you be an asshole considering:\n1- you chose how the money (that wasn't yours by the way) should be spent.\n2- didn't tell your daughter about it.\n3- gave access to your son because he didn't perform as well as her.\n\nTo me it seems like you don't accept the fact that  your children don't share the same dreams that you do.\n\nAlso, you ended up punishing your daughter for choosing a liberal/artsy course, instead of a more formal one. We see this when you make exceptions for your son and not for her, even though she performed better and got more scholarships. You even say \"Plus, her brother only received it for educational purposes and it wouldn't be right for her to just have it to spend now.\" SHE HAD EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES! She graduated!!! She could have used that money for college and saved or used her salary on herself. \n\nFinally, she found out about it when you gave access to it to your son. Never once were you upfront about this money and told her it was an option for her.\n\nYour son is clearly your favorite.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Enjoy only having one kid visit you in the nursing home.", "YTA. Your own insecurities are rubbing off on your daughter and it\u2019s going to impact her for a long time. Let me be the first to say it because you can\u2019t - your daughter is enough. Her talents and interests are worth it and valid and if you can\u2019t support her in the same ways as your son you don\u2019t deserve access to her. Your son is not worth more because he\u2019s entering a field that generally makes more money. I have been this daughter. It doesn\u2019t end well for anyone involved", "You need to ask? Of course YTA! Give your daughter her money!", "YTA, their grandparents specified it be for education, if they didn't have your snobbery then the money hasn't been used as they wished.", "YTA. BIG TIME.\n\nFrom the very start you set this up so you had all the power over money that was intended for YOUR CHILDREN. You kept this a secret from them well into adulthood based on your belief that they would go to grad school and get PHDs because that's what YOU did. From the very start, this money should have been available to them for any type of education they wanted after high school and they should have known about it. I would be upset about this if I were the grandparents and my generous contribution was wasted by you two thinking you can see the future and thinking you know best.\n\nYou seem to think that your children need to follow the same path as you. You withheld the funds from your daughter because you didn't agree with her choices - plain and simple. You thought her liberal arts education and her choices were unwise. That's why you didn't give her the money. She had to work to cover her expenses, while your son, who apparently has chosen something you think is \"better\", does not. If you can't see the favoritism here, that just shows how blind you are. Your daughter is calling you out, and she is 100% right to be upset with you about this whole thing.\n\nMy advice to you is to start seeing your children as individuals and not extensions of you. There is more than one way to be successful and higher education is not for everyone. As long as they are productive members of society, be proud of your children's accomplishments and support them as they make their OWN path in life. You should take note that whatever you two did, despite all your education and accomplishments, neither of your children wanted to follow in your footsteps.\n\nYou should apologize to your daughter. Then take the unused money, and give it back to your parents, telling them that you screwed this all up by making assumptions, and let them decide what to do with it.", "Wow.\n\nFirst, it IS her money.  Your parents set aside the funds for HER.  What kind of crazy logic is saying a fund that was setup for your daughter's education is not hers?\n\nSecond, what you are doing here is punishing her for getting full scholarships to undergrad.  She sounds super responsible to do that and should be rewarded with that money.  On a moral level, this is truly messed up.\n\nIf you don't want her to take the penalties for using it on non-educational expenses, then you should at least let her keep it and then use the money for her own children or any future education that she wants.  You can change the name on the fund (assuming its a 529) and pass it down to the kids.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.  If grandparents didn\u2019t make graduate school stipulations, what gives you the right to do so?  Keep in mind if these funds were left to them specifically, and you may be *breaking the law* by withholding the monies.", "YTA\n\nThat's not your money. It's your son and daughter's money that their grandparents set aside for their educational expenses. The fact that the funds existed should be something the kids knew about when they started thinking about college.", "Yup, YTA. There's no reason to have kept this money a secret from your children. Especially since it's not money coming from you but her grandparents, you really had no business deciding what kind of education was \"worthy\" of the education fund.", "YTA. That money was for school by her grandparents, it should\u2019ve been given to her for school. Withholding it was never your decision to make.\n\nIf she knew the money existed when she was in school, it could\u2019ve influenced the decision she made when choosing not to attend higher education, as well as impacted other major life decisions.\n\nIf you don\u2019t give her what is owed, I honestly hope she pursues legal action.", "YTA  and genuinely horrible parents.   So what are you planning on doing with the money you stole from your daughter?", "Big time YTA.   You withheld money that was not even yours in the first place because your daughter's career/school path was beneath you and your wife. Obvious favoritism towards the son who has the \"more desirable career path.\" You pretty much told your daughter her degree was a joke even though she must have worked hard to be able to obtain the scholarships necessary to be able to afford her tuition/living expenses while living in a crappy area.", "YTA. I probably would go no contact with you if I was your daughter, completely serious", "YTA\u2014the money was for her education. You did not say there were caveats to the agreement. You shouldn\u2019t have withheld money forcing her to live in an unsafe area because you don\u2019t agree with her choices. Scholarships or no, she still deserved the money. Also, YTA because you hid this from her, but not her brother. Why do you clearly favor your son? Also, YTA because just because you have a phd and your wife has a masters doesn\u2019t make you smarter or better than anyone else and you clearly think it does.
