Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n > In the scenario presented, I took the action of telling their sister-in-law that she needs to discipline her children. While the action itself may not seem inherently negative, it is possible that the way in which the person communicated their thoughts could be seen as insensitive or hurtful.\n\nBy telling her that she needs to discipline their children, the I am essentially criticizing the way in which the she is raising their kids. This could be seen as a personal attack, and the sister-in-law may feel as though the person is judging her parenting skills.\n\nAdditionally, the my comments may have been made in front of other family members, which could have caused embarrassment or discomfort for my sister-in-law. She may feel as though she is being publicly shamed for her parenting choices, which could cause long-term damage to their relationship.\n\nIn some cases, it may be appropriate to discuss parenting concerns with a family member, but it is important to do so in a compassionate and respectful manner. I could have approached the sister-in-law in private and expressed their concerns in a non-judgmental way. I could have offered to help or support the sister-in-law in disciplining her children, rather than simply criticizing her.\n\nUltimately, the judgment of whether my actions make me an asshole depends on the way in which I communicated my thoughts to the sister-in-law. If I was respectful and compassionate, then they may not be considered an asshole. However, if I came across as judgmental or insensitive, then I may be seen as an asshole for criticizing my sister-in-law's parenting skills.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But attacking them verbally does nothing but make situations worse, and I know from experience. Personal story: I had a friend who had insanely large breasts, then she got pregnant and decided to exclusively breast feed. I was the first one to the hospital when she had him and when I walked into the room\u2026 he was latched but she was asleep with him half falling out of her lap and her breast on the verge of covering his nose. I helped her and stayed the night with her to help her get into the flow of breast feeding (I\u2019d don\u2019t it and spent a long time educating myself). After about a week of hovering over her because she kept falling asleep while breast feeding and nearly suffocating the child, I snapped. I fussed at her and told her that she\u2019s irresponsible, this is a human life, she needs to be a better mom and pay more attention before she regrets it. She also snapped and said that she was the mother, he didn\u2019t need two of them and for me to fuck off. So I did. A month later\u2026 he passed from the very thing I tried to protect him from. Had I been more compassionate in how I expressed myself, I know she would have listened. She would have been willing to hear me. But I chose to take my anger and make it her anger. A best friend of 15 years was lost in less than 4 weeks, along with her son. \n\nYou\u2019re both adults. Talk to each other like adults. If you\u2019re willing to criticize then also be willing to offer a resolution, help from yourself or resources that are there for them\u2026 make it constructive. Otherwise - what\u2019s the point of triggering self defense mechanisms that just make the other person experience shame, guilt, and disassociation? To make yourself feel better and like you have the moral high ground? It\u2019s hard to be compassionate in the moment, but you\u2019ll never learn how to do it real time if you don\u2019t practice it. \n\n\nAll crap aside - it sucks when people just let their kids run amok like that. It\u2019s disappointing and can feel disrespectful. It sucks and you have every right to feel frustrated.", "NTA\n\nI'd suggest putting your foot down and simply stating that until your niblings learn how to behave better, they are not welcome at your home.\n\nMake sure that your husband interacts with his family.", "YTA - For not holding both parents accountable.    You are putting it all on the SIL.", "NTA and if the brother knows this HE can step in and discipline the kids.  That or just ask if they will be at a party and of they will be politely decline.", "NTA. Lisa is creating monsters by not teaching her children how to behave. You did nothing wrong by asking her to care for her kids. I would start handing them a bill for whatever they break or simply stop inviting them. Why can't the husband discipline them since the wife is to depressed to do so?", "NTA. You might tell your BIL too.", "NTA. The people saying the father should do it are idiots. Yeah nothing sexist expecting a man to work and parent and his wife does nothing. Pretty obvious how the labour has been divided. She is in charge of the kids and setting boundaries. She isn't doing it. She is failing her kids. \n\n\"Oh well shes anxious and depressed\" go to a doctor. Do something. Don't pass your trauma and problems onto your kids. Its insanely damaging to children to let them behave like this. They need boundaries, they need control, or they will grow up all messed up. \n\nBut again to the people who think its fine to have a husband look after the kids, his depressed wife and also work 60 hours, because its sexist to expect a mother to look after her kids - wtf.", "Jumping on the yop comment to ask why their father can't discipline them?", "NTA. This is not just the sister in law\u2019s problem. This goes for her husband as well.", "No. Nope. Nope nope nope. She's the SAHP. If she can't handle the kids, then she and BIL should switch roles, but there's no excuse for not parenting. I'm not saying BIL can't do it, and he should, but there's too much that will slip through the cracks when he's working for him to be the main disciplinary.", "One warning and then what?", "Exactly that's what am saying, its better to tell them early what's right and what's wrong so they don't make bigger mistakes in future.", "Regret not disciplining them, because if you don't enforce rules and whatnot early, you end up with older kids/teens that don't listen to anyone and get themselves in trouble", "When I was a kid my mom never disciplined me and let me do what I want. When I was like 11 -13 I remember there was point my mom had enough and tried to put her foot down and I kinda just laughed in her face and said \"lol you've never been a parent to me before. Don't know why you'd start now\" and did what I wanted anyway. There were a few more times in my teens it was like that. At the time I honestly wasn't afraid of her and it was more I had no respect for her authority whereas all my other friends did listen to their parents because that was just a habit they learned when they were younger.", "[removed]", "Could be she was the one that was closest when the incident happened", "If Mom\u2019s anxiety and depression is so bad that breaking plates and a vase is \u201clet them have fun\u201d \u2026 it\u2019s time for inpatient", "In another comment she says it is because her BIL works a lot and doesn't parent much, not because he isn't their father.", "Usually, sure, but he was there at the party with you all, and the collective responsibility for good parenting is his to share, regardless of his working time. You should have pushed back when he criticised you and pointed out that sure, maybe Lisa has depression and is overloaded, so that means it's his job to step up and take up her slack. Because the kids need to be parented by someone.", "So BIL *is* the father. Good to know, because your post makes his wife seem like a single parent with the sole responsibility for these kids.\n\nMaybe the kids are terrible, but you've got some real serious internalized misogyny if you think it's okay to treat women as solely responsible for children in a two-parent household.\n\nFor a start, just talk to the partner you're related to. If that's the dad, then you approach the dad.\n\nYTA", "Right? One warning and then they were taken out back and shot.  They never did it again.", "A Demerit \n\nYou do not want to receive three of those.", "Well..\n\nI held them up against the wall with their feet dangling and told them I would end them if they ever spoke to their mother that way again.  \n\nNever needed a second.   \n\nAlways well behaved after that, went to uni, both own homes in their 20s.", "NTA.  If my mum had disciplined my brother when he was younger, he wouldn't have a criminal record now and would more than likely be in a good job with qualifications.  He was such a smart kid \ud83e\udd7a", "I'm with you and I agree, but that's practically the opposite of what the other person said.\n\n> its better to discipline children at early age then to regret it later.\n\nWhy would you regret it later?", "Okay?", "Truely interesting. Hope you're good now \ud83d\ude0a", "Okay, but why would you regret disciplining them after the fact?", "he married the woman knowing about the kids. BIL is the father now.", "Could also be that the father isn't in the picture.", "Yes but OP even refers to them as \u201chusband\u2019s SIL\u2019s kids\u201d and \u201cLisa\u2019s kids\u201d which is weird because why not say \u201cmy BIL\u2019s kids\u201d. It\u2019s like OP thinks the kids are just Lisa\u2019s when they\u2019re not. Tbh I refer to my husbands brothers kids as my nieces and nephews.

I thought that maybe he wasn't the father or that dad was dead, because op said my sil has two kids. Not my il have two kids. Maybe that's why kids misbehave, if their dad spends little to none time with them.", "Pull his weight? Homie is out here busting his ass 60 hours a week and is expected to have as big an impact on his kids behaviour as the mother? I\u2019d be surprised if he even sees his kids on a weekday working 60 hours. Sure he should do more in this specific scenario as he is around, but if they are allowed to run rampant for 5 days of the week, nothing he does on the other 2 is going to do much to change their behaviour. \n\nMum obviously needs help with whatever she is going through but it\u2019s completely fair for her to be viewed as the \u201cMain Parent\u201d as it\u2019s her parenting during the week that is going to make the difference.", "Under a nice shady tree.

Great parenting advice. Their success is in spite of your efforts, not because of them.", "Wtf why are you advocating for this? It's literally the argument.

Even were he working 80 hours a week, when he is present he needs to be turned on, I am sorry. He deserves some down time but so does his wife, and she deserves for him to tag in AT LEAST half the time when both are physically present-- if she is having a serious mental health crisis then more while she gets treatment.\n\nAlso clearly this gathering was at his own family's home. If anyone HE should be the one most mortified and stepping in when his aunt is called fat.\n\nFinally even if I agreed with you you should only address your sibling's kids behaviour WITH YOUR SIBLING, not their spouse.

Somebody admitting to child abuse and then justifying it", "Two kids who grow to be successful adults, earning in the top 5% by their 20s.    \n\nI know right...never hear those types of stories on reddit.", "Whatever", "Funny enough neither has any mental health issues.", "That does make a lot more sense.\n\nPerhaps I was having a brain fart.", "Ahh that does make a lot more sense.
