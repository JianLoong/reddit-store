Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n > In the scenario presented, I took the action of telling their sister-in-law that she needs to discipline her children. While the action itself may not seem inherently negative, it is possible that the way in which the person communicated their thoughts could be seen as insensitive or hurtful.\n\nBy telling her that she needs to discipline their children, the I am essentially criticizing the way in which the she is raising their kids. This could be seen as a personal attack, and the sister-in-law may feel as though the person is judging her parenting skills.\n\nAdditionally, the my comments may have been made in front of other family members, which could have caused embarrassment or discomfort for my sister-in-law. She may feel as though she is being publicly shamed for her parenting choices, which could cause long-term damage to their relationship.\n\nIn some cases, it may be appropriate to discuss parenting concerns with a family member, but it is important to do so in a compassionate and respectful manner. I could have approached the sister-in-law in private and expressed their concerns in a non-judgmental way. I could have offered to help or support the sister-in-law in disciplining her children, rather than simply criticizing her.\n\nUltimately, the judgment of whether my actions make me an asshole depends on the way in which I communicated my thoughts to the sister-in-law. If I was respectful and compassionate, then they may not be considered an asshole. However, if I came across as judgmental or insensitive, then I may be seen as an asshole for criticizing my sister-in-law's parenting skills.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe BIL should be the one to keep up with the kids if SIL is unwell.", "NTA but Why can't her husband PARENT HIS KIDS?", "NTA, its better to discipline children at early age then to regret it  later.", "NTA. It sucks that she felt uncomfortable, but her poor parenting has lead other people to have really uncomfortable experiences and their stuff to be straight up destroyed. She also demonstrated that she thinks it's acceptable behavior by trying to excuse her inaction by saying they're kids, as if kids are incapable of behaving.", "INFO: Can you give an example of kids' behavior? What exactly did they break? What did they say that was disrespectful?", "There's two parents.\n\nWhy is the husband absolved from disciplining the kids?\n\nHe needs to be read the riot act as well.\n\nThere are two parents.", "NTA\n\nThat's a two parent household and what is the father doing by not laying down the law on those kids? He made up excuses for why she couldn't do anything, what's his?", "NTA\nMental health isn't an excuse for not telling your disrespectful children to behave. The father could help out aa well rather than making excuses too.", "I think the mother has an excuse as depression and anxiety can be crippling. Why isn\u2019t the father being held to account? This is when he should be stepping up to the plate as she\u2019s clearly not coping.", "INFO: What specific impact does her children's bad behaviour have on your life? It sounds like you were in someone else's home, and they were breaking other people's stuff. \n\nI think you have a stronger justification for intervening if they have damaged your possessions, or done other specific things that affect you. You say that you don't want to be the one who has to clean up after her children or deal with their bad behaviour - how has this actually played out, so far? \n\nIn either case, I'd suggest speaking in future about the specific ways in which it affects you, rather than speaking for other people or making general comments about her parenting. \n\n(apologies if this is in fact how you framed it to her - it doesn't come across very clearly from your post).", "Was the gathering at your house? Was it your things that they were destroying? If not, then you probably shouldn't have said anything, especially since you never know what's going on within someone's family, as you found out.\n\nHaving said that, if the kids are disrespectful to you and break your things, then you need to enforce boundaries. You can express your boundaries without telling someone else what to do. Eg \"you need to discipline your kids\" isn't the right thing to say to someone. However, \"I won't tolerate disrespect, so if your kids don't apologise to me, then I won't be interacting with them anymore\" or \"your child broke my lamp so I expect you to replace it, otherwise you will no longer be welcome in my house\" are better ways to approach the situation.\n\nEdited to change my answer. YTA, because you could have handled this better, and I notice that you refer to these kids as \"my husband's SIL's kids\" rather than your BIL's kids, and all your criticism is aimed at the kids' mum, not their dad. Kids have two parents, and you're criticising the one that has mental health issues.\n\nAnd if the kids are causing chaos in someone else's house, then don't worry about it and don't let it become your problem.", "YTA because in your post you're only talking to Lisa about disciplining the kids. Why is their father somehow exempt from this? How is this all her fault when there is clearly another parent involved? And if she is a single parent - where is the empathy and support?", "YTA for pinning it only on the SIL, they have a 2 parent household and you\u2019re only criticising the mother. The behaviours sounds awful, but the way you approached it is gross, telling a parent how to parent, even if you\u2019re right, will never be received well. If it was your house being destroyed, you can set boundaries in your home, but if it\u2019s not your house it\u2019s just not really your place.", "without further information i dont think we can decide. \n\nwhat did the kids do that is really that terrible? You did not include specifics. So I am left wondering how terrible a 5 and 7 yo can be and if you are just judgemental of your SIL since your brother-in-law appeared nowhere in this diatribe until the end. \n\nThat said, you have a right to set boundaries and say, \"in our house we clean up our toys\".  You have the right to restrict the areas for them to play in to keep the mess down. \n\nYou do not have the right to discipline other people's kids. The fact discipline is a word you use freely and frequently makes me think this is your answer - when there are far more effective strategies you could use in dealing with kids that age (reminder: 5 and 7).", "ESH so yes it sounds like the kids need discipline ru Ning around and actually breaking things at that age is disgraceful, however talking back? Are you kidding? You sound like a disciplinarian and a joy to be around. Which make me wonder how much you are exaggerating the children's behavior.", "NTA what are they doing about her mental health?  Since she's struggling it's okay to just ignore your kids?", "Mental health struggles are no excuse for raising shitty kids. And let\u2019s be clear - that is what she\u2019s doing, raising misbehaving kids that will grow up to be misbehaving adults. She needs to get that stuff sorted, and I really do feel for her, but her kids need attention.\n\nThat said, where is dad in all this?

He knows his wife has mental health issues making it hard for her to parent well atm(yes discipline and guidance is a huge part of parenting young kids)and he isn't stepping up to sort them out?
