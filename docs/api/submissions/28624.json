My SIL got an au pair, Mary, from the Philippines two years ago and she's been great for their family. A year ago Mary told us that her sister, Catherine, also in the Philippines, wants to be an au pair and would really like to come and live with us. We interviewed her and she seemed fine and we felt it was less risky choosing her over a random au pair since her sister could vouch for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nCatherine came in May and from her 3rd day or so started talking back to us and would rarely ever smile. On most days she worked 1-2 hours less than the mandated maximum and we tried to keep her happy. Catherine had no interest in eating dinner or spending time with us, and would usually spend all her free time outside. Eventually we found out that she had a boyfriend she had met online before coming to us and he lived in a nearby city. Over the span of 2 months Catherine got into small arguments with us on a weekly basis and would always walk around with a stern look on her face. We tried to mend things with her but she decided to leave us and move to a family who lived close to her boyfriend. The week before she left she said she was considering reporting us to the police for \"not treating her like family\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 2.5 months Catherine stayed with us she was a constant headache and emotionally traumatized us with her overtly negative attitude and body language. Her police threat could possibly qualify for psychological abuse. On top of this it cost us close to 2000$ to bring her over from the Philippines. We've since learned that her sister, Mary, knew about her wanting to come over so that she could be with her boyfriend and that Catherine was known for being lazy and an all around terrible person. We feel betrayed by Mary for misusing our trust since she knew her sister was terrible and that her agenda was to be reunited with her boyfriend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy SIL is hosting this year's christmas and Mary will also be there. I don't want to be around Mary because I feel betrayed and that I may have a visceral reaction from seeing her face which resembles Catherine. My SIL thinks I'm childish for not wanting to spend christmas there because of her au pair. My wife does also not want to be around Mary but she has a stronger bond with her sister and would rather spend christmas with her rather than my family. We've gotten into a fair amount of disagreements the past few days and I'm being accused of ruining family bonds by letting my own disdain for Mary take precedence over spending time with my SIL's family.  As a middle ground I've suggested letting Mary take the holidays off and spend those days somewhere else, but I was called out for being absurd.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to be anywhere near their au pair?\n\nEDIT: I realize the phrasing \"emotionally traumatized\" sounds a bit silly now. What I meant was that it's taxing to deal with a person who is always looking to snap back and gaslight us for mistreating her. She was always unhappy and got into arguments on a weekly basis. It was like having an emotionally abusive member in our household. On top of that the threat of a dumb police report can be enough for the authorities to make us pay fines. Au pairs are considered to be a vulnerable group so there is little sympathy for host families, understandably.\n\nThe mandated maximum is 5 hours of work per day. Catherine would work 3 hours on average. We didn't care that she worked less as long as the tasks were done. We payed her in full and even gave her small gifts, e.g. phone card boosts, cash, train tickets every now and then.

You said she worked less than the maximum hours, but not that she worked less than the minimum. But yet you call her lazy.\n\n3. An au pair is allowed to have off time just like everyone else. Maybe she didn't want to have meals with the family because she'd still be expected to care for the children while eating, and didn't want to work more than she had to. Maybe she didn't feel part of the family because you treated her like a servant and not a human being.\n\nI think there's a lot of missing missing reasons here and from the limited nannying experience I've had, even a few hours a day staying with the family is draining--especially because I was just there to pick up after the family.

Are you really going to bow out of all future family events.
