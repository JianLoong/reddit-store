My SIL got an au pair, Mary, from the Philippines two years ago and she's been great for their family. A year ago Mary told us that her sister, Catherine, also in the Philippines, wants to be an au pair and would really like to come and live with us. We interviewed her and she seemed fine and we felt it was less risky choosing her over a random au pair since her sister could vouch for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nCatherine came in May and from her 3rd day or so started talking back to us and would rarely ever smile. On most days she worked 1-2 hours less than the mandated maximum and we tried to keep her happy. Catherine had no interest in eating dinner or spending time with us, and would usually spend all her free time outside. Eventually we found out that she had a boyfriend she had met online before coming to us and he lived in a nearby city. Over the span of 2 months Catherine got into small arguments with us on a weekly basis and would always walk around with a stern look on her face. We tried to mend things with her but she decided to leave us and move to a family who lived close to her boyfriend. The week before she left she said she was considering reporting us to the police for \"not treating her like family\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 2.5 months Catherine stayed with us she was a constant headache and emotionally traumatized us with her overtly negative attitude and body language. Her police threat could possibly qualify for psychological abuse. On top of this it cost us close to 2000$ to bring her over from the Philippines. We've since learned that her sister, Mary, knew about her wanting to come over so that she could be with her boyfriend and that Catherine was known for being lazy and an all around terrible person. We feel betrayed by Mary for misusing our trust since she knew her sister was terrible and that her agenda was to be reunited with her boyfriend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy SIL is hosting this year's christmas and Mary will also be there. I don't want to be around Mary because I feel betrayed and that I may have a visceral reaction from seeing her face which resembles Catherine. My SIL thinks I'm childish for not wanting to spend christmas there because of her au pair. My wife does also not want to be around Mary but she has a stronger bond with her sister and would rather spend christmas with her rather than my family. We've gotten into a fair amount of disagreements the past few days and I'm being accused of ruining family bonds by letting my own disdain for Mary take precedence over spending time with my SIL's family.  As a middle ground I've suggested letting Mary take the holidays off and spend those days somewhere else, but I was called out for being absurd.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to be anywhere near their au pair?\n\nEDIT: I realize the phrasing \"emotionally traumatized\" sounds a bit silly now. What I meant was that it's taxing to deal with a person who is always looking to snap back and gaslight us for mistreating her. She was always unhappy and got into arguments on a weekly basis. It was like having an emotionally abusive member in our household. On top of that the threat of a dumb police report can be enough for the authorities to make us pay fines. Au pairs are considered to be a vulnerable group so there is little sympathy for host families, understandably.\n\nThe mandated maximum is 5 hours of work per day. Catherine would work 3 hours on average. We didn't care that she worked less as long as the tasks were done. We payed her in full and even gave her small gifts, e.g. phone card boosts, cash, train tickets every now and then.

You said she worked less than the maximum hours, but not that she worked less than the minimum. But yet you call her lazy.\n\n3. An au pair is allowed to have off time just like everyone else. Maybe she didn't want to have meals with the family because she'd still be expected to care for the children while eating, and didn't want to work more than she had to.

Especially since it was Mary who approached you about her sister. Mary also believes she did nothing wrong, she didn't apologize correct? (At this point it she does apologize, she's lying).\n\nYou may even be angry at the SIL for thinking what happened is ok. That they think this has nothing to do with Mary and she's innocent. \n\nShe's not innocent, she knew exactly what she was doing, she was an active participant with her sister. She approached you \n\nOn top of that Catherine threatens to go to the cops and guesssing lie so that you won't force her to continue working for you(?).  If you had to sponsor her work Visa, you might want to let them know she no longer works for you,  she took a new job elsewhere.  Legally you might need to do this - look into it.\n\nIts not ok and has everything to do with Mary lying. None of this would have happened if she were an honest person.\n\nYou're out $2,000 for someone who did not stay. Nannies and au pairs make a required one year commitment to the family / each other (at least through an agency). Each year, both decide if they want to continue the arrangement.  \n\nNext time go through an agency that has a good reputation,  they'll handle these situations and make it right. Get a nanny not an au pair. Lesson learned.\n\nYou were invited over for Christmas. Like any invite, its not a mandatory performance to attend. \n\nIf this were a wedding invite and someone will be there you want nothing to do with, you would decline and no one would have a problem with it. \n\nYou explained how you and your wife felt, what the situation was.  Said you'd come if Mary weren't there and why. You made a request. \n\nBrides get these requests too. And like any bride, she can decline to accommodate and that's ok too. In this case your SIL has declined to accommodate and that's ok. \n\nYou're wife wants to go to her sister's even though she feels the same way about Mary. That's her choice.\n\nYou dropped the topic and  decline coming over on Christmas. From how it appears, your not badgering anyone to change their minds about Mary. You simply won't be there. \n\nIf friends invite you over,  go if you want to.  You can even make reservations at a restaurant for yourself,  who says you can't dine alone. Besides getting more common these days. Or buy frozen dinner and put in the oven. (Make reservations now so you're all set, you can always cancel later if want to, mark your calendar) \n\nYou're not ruining family bonds by not going.  We could look at this from a different angle and say that they are creating disharmony and friction by inviting Mary. Will you seriously be happy and cheerful in the same room as Mary? \n\nYou're establishing boundaries. In this situation, you don't plan to attend. You're not forcing anyone to accommodate you.  \n\nNext year you and your wife can host and invite who you want and everyone can come over if they'd like too.\n \nTHEIR comfort should not come at YOUR expense. \n\nThey are bullying you to do what they want. Being manipulative to get you to change your mind.  You're all adults and everyone can spend Christmas where they want.", "YTA. You're being very childish. Just because Catherine didn't work out for you, you want to ruin Christmas because her sister is there? Grow up.", "This one is tough. \n\nWhile I see what your wife and her sister mean, I also see that this was a traumatic experience for you. \n\nYou welcomed someone into your home based on you trusting your SIL and her au pair, then the person who was there to take care of your **children** treated you all terribly and it came out that she used you for a one-way ticket. \n\nThen she said that if you spoke up, she would accuse you of abuse, putting your family in danger. \n\nTHEN, your SIL\u2019s au pair told you that she abused the trust she earned from the family to basically steal money from you. \n\nAND THEN, your SIL and wife are dismissing your feelings and reaction. \n\nAND NOW, people on this sub are trashing you because they don\u2019t understand an au pair situation. \n\nI mean\u2026 I think that if you had received acknowledgment and an apology from your SIL and Mary, and you refused to go, then you\u2019d be TA. \n\nAs it stands, I wouldn\u2019t want to go and be nice to the person who set me up to be the victim of fraud, either. \n\nNTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you went through this.", "Yes, YTA, congratulations.", "You must have never had someone like this come live with you. I am also emotionally traumatized by a former roommate", "Don\u2019t be so quick to judge people who need to employ au pairs and live in domestic workers. Yes they can be a vulnerable group, but other times like in this case, they cause more problems for their employers. \n\nImagine paying $2000 in immigration fees to hire someone, only for that person to work only 3 hours a day, constantly angry at you, and then ditching you after only 3 months. You still need an au pair so now you\u2019re looking at forking out another $2000 to find someone, not knowing if they\u2019re going to ditch you again after 3 months. This is a dilemma many people are going through because it is common for people to use these systems as a gateway to gain entry into a country. \n\nI have been in OP\u2019s shoes before. We hired a live in domestic helper to take care of my grandmother who is wheelchair bound. The helper constantly argued against doing what she was asked to do, and insisted on doing things her way (e.g. my mom would ask her to feed grandma on time but she would insist on cleaning the floors first, even though my mom says the floors are fine and can skip being cleaned on that day). And then she would sob and claim emotional abuse. \n\nAsk her to clean the bathroom in grandma\u2019s room? (yes this is part of her scope of work). Sobs because it will take so long (even though we told her she didn\u2019t need to do some of her other regular duties so that she has time to clean the bathroom) \n\nAnd then one day she left. And now we have to deal with immigration because in our country, we\u2019re responsible for sponsoring her visa. \n\nDon\u2019t be so quick to judge employers.", "But very few people would stretch that to the point of saying they're \"traumatized\" and skip family events because they can't stand to look at the face of a completely different person who sorta looks like an unhappy employee they used to have.\n\n\nOP sounds overly dramatic.", "Now I want to go on a trip with chirping geckos!!", "The maximum amount they can make her work a day, legally, is five hours. This does not mean she HAD to work five hours. OP said he didn't care how many hours she worked as long as the tasks were done. He didn't say the tasks were not done. It sounds like she got them done in three hours and he's mad she didn't stay after getting her tasks done....even though he claims he just cared if they were done.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you'd love the gig. OP was absolutely being manipulative with the way they wrote it.", "Teenagers are 100% emotionally traumatizing.  \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "And dogs! I KNOW they aggravate me on purpose!   \ud83e\udd23\u2764\ufe0f", "It pretty specific she worked 3 hours a day & not the 5 she was contracted for. All she wanted to do was leave to hang w bf.", "...No. She wasn't contracted for five, five was the maximum they could have her work per day, legally. He said he didn't care as long as the tasks were done. He didn't say they weren't done. It sounds like she go them done in three hours. OP worded shit really weird so people would make the mistake you made. OP is manipulative as fuck.", "Are they a professional performing their duties or a monkey you bought to dance for you?", "You think it's professional to have a shitty attitude? Who said anything about dance? What are you talking about? \n\nAnyhow you didn't answer my question.\n\nEDIT: Nanny sounds like she had terrible vibes.", "An au pair is part of a culture exchange thing.
