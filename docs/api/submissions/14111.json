Before me, my sister and my boyfriend used to have dinner together, after the marriage my sister never invited us together to her place, it\u2019s always in a restaurant and G doesn\u2019t go. \n\nMy sister asked me if I would take care of D for this weekend so she and her husband G could take a weekend off to celebrate 3 years together. I changed some plans and told them that I would do it. D is a nice little girl, she\u2019s very talkative and she\u2019s really sensitive. On Saturday we went to the mall with my boyfriend. At the mall there was a workshop arts and crafts at the playground and I left D there for 2 hours so I could have some time with my bf. I asked my sister beforehand if that was okay and she said that D loves the workshops. \n\nWhen saying goodbye my boyfriend gave me a little goodbye kiss, nothing much, just a little kiss.\nI wasn\u2019t even sure if D saw it. \nSunday morning I was watching TV with her and she asked me if my boyfriend was my friend and I said yes, but she asked why he kissed me and I had a little bit of gay panic. \n\nI carefully explained to her that he was the same that my sister was to his father. She told me \u201cbut you\u2019re boys\u201d and I said \u201cthere are boys who likes boys and there are girls who like girls and that\u2019s okay\u201d. She didn\u2019t say anything after that. \n\nOn Monday I got an angry text from G saying that D was confused because of me. I called him and he was just shouting that I had no right to introduce \u201cmy way of life\u201d to his daughter. I was shocked and I called my sister, who said that I shouldn\u2019t have told D what gay people is. Tuesday in the afternoon I got an email from G saying that he was taking D to a psychologist to see what damage I caused to his daughter and that I was supposed to pay for the session, he was even talking about a lawsuit against me. I was very shocked and I called my dad, who is a lawyer, to ask him what I should do. My parents were very upset with the situation and they decided to come to our city, we (me and my sister) live in the capital and my parents in a small city 3 hours from here. \n\nThe situation escalated a little bit because G told my dad that he wasn\u2019t going to make the same mistakes that he did with me and my dad was very angry about it. He said that G isn\u2019t welcomed in our family anymore and he doesn\u2019t want to ever see him again. My sister, who I thought was at my side, just flipped at me saying that my mistake was going to destroy her marriage. My parents are on my side and my friends too, but my sister is very angry at me and even her best friend texted me saying I was stupid and childish to bring my father to the matter.

G is clearly homophobic and is projecting that onto his family.  Your sister, also the AH, is sacrificing you to protect the stability in what she is accepting as a solid relationship.  Her friend can stay out of it. You've clearly identified that this is a family concern, so I don't blame you for bringing in your parents.  I think understanding your sister's mindset is critical in ensuring this does not escalate further.  \n\nWhat irritates me most is that G's relationship with your sister is accepted and fine, but yours is \"confusing\" and cause for psychologist visits.  He'll probably pick one that supports his POV, which will simply make matters worse.  I worry that if G doesn't accept the reality that is gays existence, your going to lose any relationship you have with your sister.  That she accepted this and married him is appalling.

Clearly G is homophobic and your sister tried to have both worlds (her family and her husband) co-exist at the same time.  While they have a right to raise their child how they see fit, they do not have a right to require you to lie.  You have handled the situation with grace and it is nice to see your family backing you up. As for your sister - she just had her two worlds collide and can not pretend there is no issue. She will have to make a decision and it is probably not an easy one for her if she loves her husband...", "You left a 5 year old in a playground for 2 hours while you hung out with your boyfriend????? \n\nNTA for the actual question you asked but dear God what were you thinking?", "NTA.

You should have just said, \"Ask your mom/dad,\" or something along those lines.  \nEDIT: To clarify, I don't OP did anything **wrong**, I just feel that these kinds of discussions are better off handled by parents, or at least the parents should be informed that their kids are starting to ask these questions.

That's taught behaviour. No need to guess who taught her that.", "NTA. In the month of June, gay pride is everywhere - tv, billboards, advertisements, etc\u2026 Unless you live under a rock, it\u2019ll come up and you\u2019ll need to discuss it with your kid. Sometimes, the opportunity doesn\u2019t present itself - until it suddenly does. This is actually a great way to present it organically. Like \u201csee, no big deal.\u201d", "NTA - If anything it sounds like G is the one that's confused here.", "So your sister married a homophobic bigot and wants to pretend it it ok. She is not on your side. NTA.", "NTA. If you don't want your kids exposed to queer folks don't ask them to babysit your kids. Your sister sucks and she's just being consistent in her decision to pretend homophobia isn't a problem when it would personally inconvenience her to have a moral backbone.", "Your sister willingly married a raging homophobe who was always going to look down upon you and your family.\n\nNTA, children are not \"confused\" by lgbt+ people existing and you didn't tell her anything inappropriate.", "Your sister should have seen the ref flags. Also, homophobia is the little brother of misogyny. She should have gotten TF out when he first said something about you.", "I\u2019m going to give the sister a little grace here because I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s totally financially dependent on G, or if she\u2019s in a position where she can safely stand up to him. \n\nHer anger at her brother could be from a place of fear. If she loves the kid, and they split, she\u2019s likely to lose all contact with the child.  If he\u2019s abusive, she\u2019s going to react in ways to appease him. \n\nOr, she could just be a jerk. But, until I know, I\u2019d like to not assume the worst. Women in toxic relationships can do some pretty strange things out of self preservation.", "I mean a lot of people do think God forbids it. Or at the very least pretend they do to justify trying to avoid doing it.", "Had me in the first half lol", "I wonder just how the 5-year-old was questioned by G to make G believe she was traumatized by the explanation OP gave her. G probably traumatized the poor child by asking her repeatedly if OP talked about \u201cgay\u201d things to her and is now blaming OP for that trauma.", "This is not a sexual matter, and he did not have anyhting near \u201cthe talk\u201d with the kid. She asked a question about OP\u2019s boyfriend and he replied in a VERY age appropriate way. \n\nWhat do you suggest as an alternative when the kid questions his relationship with bf? Try to hide it, deny, ignore? Perhaps don\u2019t kiss bf in front of the kid in the first place? The idea that what OP said is inappropriate and that he should hide his orientation in front of kids is homophobic too. He didn\u2019t grab a dudes dick in public or expose the child to sexual activity. \n\nIf the parents didn\u2019t want their child exposed to a gay person, they shouldn\u2019t have left her with an openly gay person. OP did not cross any line here.", "\"Discussing sexuality\" ...lmao dude he only answered a kids question about his boyfriend and nothing more. how hard you grasp for straws is honestly pathetic.", "First of all, a 5-year-old is old enough to know that there are boys who like boys and girls who like girls. Children take that information in stride.\n\nSecondly, if you are so bothered by someone other than yourself telling them about it, then don\u2019t ask your gay brother who has a boyfriend to babysit. And don\u2019t bring your kid to any family functions where your gay brother might bring their SO. Because that kid is incredibly curious and will ask about it, and it\u2019s not fair to put you family members in that situation. \n\nAnd to be frank, if your kid doesn\u2019t know about same sex couples at 5, while having a gay uncle, the situation is entirely your own fault. No one else is responsible for safeguarding your kids ignorance about basic facts of life *in her/his own family*.", "The we should also leave kids alone in the fact that man and woman can love eachother", "God this, so much. And also, it astounds me that people think denying the existence of gay people will somehow make their kid not gay. Gay people exist. Even if you are the most homophobic person on the planet, your hatred and denial doesn\u2019t change the fact that people are gay and alive and out there. What was G going to do, pretend gay people were a myth until the kid was 18 or something? \n\nOP has at least introduced the girl to love beyond heteronormative concepts in a positive and accepting manner, not some weird hate-fuelled denial rant.\n\nPlus, G threatened OP with a lawsuit, OP called up the free legal counsel he had, which happened to be his Dad. The sister shouldn\u2019t be upset at all over that. The moment her husband threatened a lawsuit she should have expected their Dad to get involved.", "You are the hero children of bigots need.", "What I\u2019ve come to realize about homophobes is that they see queer relationships as *literally* being all about sex and nothing else, so to OP\u2019s BIL, OP might as well have been wearing fetish gear around his daughter with that kiss. So yeah, he\u2019d expect OP to hold that \u201csecret\u201d like others expect folks to hide their sex toys in polite company.\n\nNTA.", "Just because it's a different take from yours doesn't make it automatically homophobic. \n\nSome people prefer to be the one teaching their child about certain topics rather than have someone else be doing that, especially unsupervised. \n\n\n\nThough I don't think what OP did is wrong, to say \"any other take is openly homophobic\" Is far to extreme.", "Lol, I can tell your not a parent. You can read my other response for clarification. But the cliff notes version is this\u2026\n\nHis thoughts on what was appropriate have no place here. That\u2019s the parents decision, and if they got upset by something he did. Then he overstepped, simple as that. I actually agree with you that the kiddo should know already, but my thoughts on the subject are completely erroneous as well. it\u2019s not my child, it\u2019s not my choice. \n\nIt seems more like your acting from a defensive place because of the same sex part of this. And if that\u2019s the case I\u2019m sorry if you feel marginalized or hurt by society. But Again, your thoughts on the subject are of no consequence. It\u2019s not your kid.", "Perfect response. The people acting like OP was out of line or did something inappropriate are (perhaps unknowingly) supporting homophobic notions themselves. There is nothing taboo going on here.", "That\u2019s a pretty big jump there bud. And so we\u2019re clear, I don\u2019t give a shit if it\u2019s two dudes two girls, one guys and five girls, what the fuck ever. Fuck whatever consenting adult you want, I\u2019m happy you found the hole you like. But leave other people\u2019s children out of it, it\u2019s ducking weird that your trying to justify it. \n\nAny half decent parent decides the rate that their child is exposed to certain things. Especially subjects as intimate as sex. And Any moderately intelligent, self aware adult, should intuitively know not to talk about subjects that could lead to questions about sex with someone else\u2019s child. I don\u2019t care what you you think, you don\u2019t matter, why? Cause that my child, your thoughts on my parenting are of no consequence. You wanna talk to a kid about that shit, have your own. \n\nI won\u2019t even give other people\u2019s kids food, they ask me\u2026 I say ask you mom/dad. Why because that\u2019s not my child, I don\u2019t know what dietary restrictions they might have. you don\u2019t know the beliefs the parents have. Even if you think those beliefs are wrong, it\u2019s still not your place to decide. \n\nBeing invited into someones home doesn\u2019t give you parental rights over their child. And it definitely doesn\u2019t give you consent to do ANYTHING that the parents might think provocative. Again, your thoughts, views, ideas, have absolutely no place here. \n\nIf you wanted to try to do that appropriately for some weird fucking reason, you ask the child\u2019s parent first. Your probably not gonna get a lot people happily saying go ahead. If you do, great go nuts. Otherwise stay in you lane, and when in doubt\u2026 talk about subjects like science. seems like you might struggle alil at first, but everyone can learn. Assuming they are willing to anyway.", "As someone who came out to my mom in response to a biphobic rant, I really can't agree more. Hating LGTBQ2S people doesn't make your kid less LGTBQ2S. It might make them hate themselves, or you, but they will be who they will be.", "G: gay people aren\u2019t real, they can\u2019t hurt me\n\nMe creeping up behind him wearing a rainbow suit:", "Nah - most homophobic men are most scared of being treated the same way they treat women (not that they are gay themselves). So you should worry for your sister, but not cos her husband\u2019s gay", "Sometimes straight people are in fact just homophobic. Most of the time I'd wager. Most bigots aren't actually secretly members of the group they're bigoted against.", "If they want to introduce the concept to their kids themselves, perhaps they should\u2019ve found another babysitter instead of her gay uncle and his boyfriend. \n\nLeaving their kid with a homosexual couple and being angry when their kid is exposed to that is homophobic. Did they expect OP to hide his orientation? Act like he\u2019s in the closet?\n\nYou know damn well why they don\u2019t want someone else teaching their kids about this. It\u2019s not because they wanted to do it themselves! It\u2019s because they were trying to shield their daughter. A non-homophobic couple would not be upset over this. \n\nSo yes, any other take is homophobic, because it implies there is something taboo or inappropriate going on here, which is not the case.", "If your take is that queer relationships are less child appropriate than straight ones it's homophobic.", "Telling a child about the existence of same sex couples is not the same thing as telling them about sex. That is all your own hang up. You are the one thinking about \u201choles\u201d, not the 5-year-old. \n\nAgain, raise your kid whatever way you want. But if you don\u2019t want them to know about the existence of gay people, don\u2019t ask your gay brother to babysit. And don\u2019t bring your kid to family functions because no-one is going back into the closet for your toddlers sake. \n\nIf you have no gay people in your life you might get away with not telling your kids about the existence same-sex couples until they\u2019re older (though good luck controlling what they hear once they\u2019re in pre-school/elementary school). But with a gay family member? You really need to get out ahead of it.", "Knowing basic facts about the world is relevant to all children. Learning about the world around them is their entire job.", "2S?", "Again. Don\u2019t care what kind of relationship. I don\u2019t want any couples talking about any part of their relationship dynamics with my child at that age. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want them to know about the existence of same sex relationships, or sex at all. It\u2019s that I decide when and how that is done, In this case maybe the parents should have done that already\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t make it ok to do something the parent says is inappropriate. They call that shot, not you. you don\u2019t like it? Go find someone else to hang out with.\n\nRemember, you options don\u2019t matter here. You have to default to the parent\u2019s decision.", "2S=Two-Spirit", "Once again, don\u2019t ask your gay family member to babysit then. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve heard your argument before, and it always reeks of hypocrisy. No one has ever asked their straight family member or friend to hide their relationship with an opposite-sex partner while interacting with a child, an no one has ever been mad at grandma for telling a grandchild that she and grandpa loves each other. \n\nThe brother didn\u2019t seek out to \u201chang out\u201d with his niece. He did his sister and BIL a favor. When they asked him to babysit, they did not put limits on what he could tell her about his relationship. If they had, he could have agreed to those terms or declined. They put themselves in this situation.", "Continuing to try to rationalize this won\u2019t change the fact that he did something that obviously upset the child\u2019s parents. That makes it inappropriate. Simple as that. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s irrational from your perspective. Your perspective has no place in this. \n\nAnd Doing favors for someone doesn\u2019t give you the right to go against their wishes in regards to their children. Nor does the amount of time you\u2019ve spent with them. \n\nI\u2019ll simplify it even more for you since you seem to think you can somehow talk your way around this. \n\nWhen dealing with a child that is not yours, if the parents tells you not to do something. Don\u2019t fucking do it. I know that\u2019s hard for some people to hear, a lot of us were raised to think our opinions always matter and should always be heard by everyone. But that\u2019s simply not true here."]}
