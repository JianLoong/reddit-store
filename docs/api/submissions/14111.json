Before me, my sister and my boyfriend used to have dinner together, after the marriage my sister never invited us together to her place, it\u2019s always in a restaurant and G doesn\u2019t go. \n\nMy sister asked me if I would take care of D for this weekend so she and her husband G could take a weekend off to celebrate 3 years together. I changed some plans and told them that I would do it. D is a nice little girl, she\u2019s very talkative and she\u2019s really sensitive. On Saturday we went to the mall with my boyfriend. At the mall there was a workshop arts and crafts at the playground and I left D there for 2 hours so I could have some time with my bf. I asked my sister beforehand if that was okay and she said that D loves the workshops. \n\nWhen saying goodbye my boyfriend gave me a little goodbye kiss, nothing much, just a little kiss.\nI wasn\u2019t even sure if D saw it. \nSunday morning I was watching TV with her and she asked me if my boyfriend was my friend and I said yes, but she asked why he kissed me and I had a little bit of gay panic. \n\nI carefully explained to her that he was the same that my sister was to his father. She told me \u201cbut you\u2019re boys\u201d and I said \u201cthere are boys who likes boys and there are girls who like girls and that\u2019s okay\u201d. She didn\u2019t say anything after that. \n\nOn Monday I got an angry text from G saying that D was confused because of me. I called him and he was just shouting that I had no right to introduce \u201cmy way of life\u201d to his daughter. I was shocked and I called my sister, who said that I shouldn\u2019t have told D what gay people is. Tuesday in the afternoon I got an email from G saying that he was taking D to a psychologist to see what damage I caused to his daughter and that I was supposed to pay for the session, he was even talking about a lawsuit against me. I was very shocked and I called my dad, who is a lawyer, to ask him what I should do. My parents were very upset with the situation and they decided to come to our city, we (me and my sister) live in the capital and my parents in a small city 3 hours from here. \n\nThe situation escalated a little bit because G told my dad that he wasn\u2019t going to make the same mistakes that he did with me and my dad was very angry about it. He said that G isn\u2019t welcomed in our family anymore and he doesn\u2019t want to ever see him again. My sister, who I thought was at my side, just flipped at me saying that my mistake was going to destroy her marriage. My parents are on my side and my friends too, but my sister is very angry at me and even her best friend texted me saying I was stupid and childish to bring my father to the matter.

I think understanding your sister's mindset is critical in ensuring this does not escalate further.  \n\nWhat irritates me most is that G's relationship with your sister is accepted and fine, but yours is \"confusing\" and cause for psychologist visits.

You have handled the situation with grace and it is nice to see your family backing you up. As for your sister - she just had her two worlds collide and can not pretend there is no issue.
