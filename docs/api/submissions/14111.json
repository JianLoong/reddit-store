Before me, my sister and my boyfriend used to have dinner together, after the marriage my sister never invited us together to her place, it\u2019s always in a restaurant and G doesn\u2019t go. \n\nMy sister asked me if I would take care of D for this weekend so she and her husband G could take a weekend off to celebrate 3 years together. I changed some plans and told them that I would do it. D is a nice little girl, she\u2019s very talkative and she\u2019s really sensitive. On Saturday we went to the mall with my boyfriend. At the mall there was a workshop arts and crafts at the playground and I left D there for 2 hours so I could have some time with my bf. I asked my sister beforehand if that was okay and she said that D loves the workshops. \n\nWhen saying goodbye my boyfriend gave me a little goodbye kiss, nothing much, just a little kiss.\nI wasn\u2019t even sure if D saw it. \nSunday morning I was watching TV with her and she asked me if my boyfriend was my friend and I said yes, but she asked why he kissed me and I had a little bit of gay panic. \n\nI carefully explained to her that he was the same that my sister was to his father. She told me \u201cbut you\u2019re boys\u201d and I said \u201cthere are boys who likes boys and there are girls who like girls and that\u2019s okay\u201d. She didn\u2019t say anything after that. \n\nOn Monday I got an angry text from G saying that D was confused because of me. I called him and he was just shouting that I had no right to introduce \u201cmy way of life\u201d to his daughter. I was shocked and I called my sister, who said that I shouldn\u2019t have told D what gay people is. Tuesday in the afternoon I got an email from G saying that he was taking D to a psychologist to see what damage I caused to his daughter and that I was supposed to pay for the session, he was even talking about a lawsuit against me. I was very shocked and I called my dad, who is a lawyer, to ask him what I should do. My parents were very upset with the situation and they decided to come to our city, we (me and my sister) live in the capital and my parents in a small city 3 hours from here. \n\nThe situation escalated a little bit because G told my dad that he wasn\u2019t going to make the same mistakes that he did with me and my dad was very angry about it. He said that G isn\u2019t welcomed in our family anymore and he doesn\u2019t want to ever see him again. My sister, who I thought was at my side, just flipped at me saying that my mistake was going to destroy her marriage. My parents are on my side and my friends too, but my sister is very angry at me and even her best friend texted me saying I was stupid and childish to bring my father to the matter.

G is clearly homophobic and is projecting that onto his family.  Your sister, also the AH, is sacrificing you to protect the stability in what she is accepting as a solid relationship.  Her friend can stay out of it. You've clearly identified that this is a family concern, so I don't blame you for bringing in your parents.  I think understanding your sister's mindset is critical in ensuring this does not escalate further.  \n\nWhat irritates me most is that G's relationship with your sister is accepted and fine, but yours is \"confusing\" and cause for psychologist visits.  He'll probably pick one that supports his POV, which will simply make matters worse.  I worry that if G doesn't accept the reality that is gays existence, your going to lose any relationship you have with your sister.  That she accepted this and married him is appalling.

That guy is just super homophobic.", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong here, and G sounds like a real ass. \n\nYour sister's anger is misplaced. It sounds to me like she's conflicted about having married G because he's homophobic, and it all came to a head when she somehow thought it wouldn't. It sounds like she loves you but is not strong enough or willing to go against what G says.\n\nALSO, and this is just a side note - they're very aware that you're gay. They seriously didn't think that would ever come up with the kid?", "NTA\n\nHow else are we going to end generations of hate if we don't normalize that love is love, no matter the gender.", "NTA - I know this is painful for you, but I gotta say, G is a total psycho.

They don't get to eat their cake and hide it in the closet.", "Kids shouldn't have any idea what sexual orientation is. That's why she has absolutely no idea that she has a mother and a father. Kids also shouldn't know what blond people are. And 5 is far too young to know about brown eyes. /s\n\nNTA. Your homophobic sister and her husband are.

For some reason, I thought he lived with you, but re-reading, it doesn't look like he does. \n\nI think it's silly they're taking her to a psychiatrist and want you to pay for it.  Why did they send her to your house in the first place if they're so worried about her learning about gay people.  People mess me up.  Sorry you're going through this.", "NTA. He's going to sue you for what? Existing? G needs to get over himself. \n\nAlso, your sister's marriage isn't circling the drain because you're gay. It's because she married an intolerant AH who is always looking to find something to get angry and self-righteous about.

Nor bringing your dad into it when G threatened you.\n\nG is definitely an AH. A major one.", "NTA. You did not initiate conversation and your explanation seems to be very age appropriate. Clearly G is homophobic and your sister tried to have both worlds (her family and her husband) co-exist at the same time.  While they have a right to raise their child how they see fit, they do not have a right to require you to lie.  You have handled the situation with grace and it is nice to see your family backing you up. As for your sister - she just had her two worlds collide and can not pretend there is no issue. She will have to make a decision and it is probably not an easy one for her if she loves her husband...", "You left a 5 year old in a playground for 2 hours while you hung out with your boyfriend????? \n\nNTA for the actual question you asked but dear God what were you thinking?", "NTA.

You should have just said, \"Ask your mom/dad,\" or something along those lines.  \nEDIT: To clarify, I don't OP did anything **wrong**, I just feel that these kinds of discussions are better off handled by parents, or at least the parents should be informed that their kids are starting to ask these questions. It's just unfortunate that in this case, the kids parents are homophobes and control freaks.\n\n~~Also, leaving her alone for two hours was highly irresponsible.~~ That sounds like Daycare which is much better.", "Leave the kids alone", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
