Buy whatever gifts within your budget you feel like. If it is one gift per child, the  so be it. But there's no reason to have a discussion about it or act judgy towards her.

Did you want her to reconsider having another child? Did you want her to feel guilty for essentially reducing her other children's Christmas presents?

Calling ahead to say you\u2019d be giving fewer gifts is not a good move to begin with.

I know you meant well but it was pretty rude to actually call your aunt up and do that. What they do in their marriage is their business.

Why does how many children your aunt has bother you so much?  It's her family, her life.  It's nice that you want to buy your cousins presents, but I have never expected that from my nieces and nephews in regard to my own children.  The flex you are pulling isn't exactly the flex you think it is, and mostly it just results in you making the family mad and making you look insensitive and controlling.  OP, why do you want to control your aunt's fertility?", "Soft YTA. \n\nAt 20, you are very generous. At that age I was barely making enough to cover my expenses and there is no way I would have had enough money to purchase multiple gifts for five children and pets. One gift per child is absolutely fine and nothing to be disappointed about. Financially some years are just better than others. \n\nThe way you approached your aunt makes you TA. It's not like your decision to give one gift per child will have any influence on your aunt's decision to have another child. Agree or not her life decisions are not your concerns. \n\nGo with one gift per child. If anyone says anything to you simply say it's been a tough year and leave it at that. I don't know many early 20 something's that are flush with cash and sky high inflation is taking a big bite out of everyone's budget this year. If your family doesn't understand and are only fixated on the number of gifts then they are TAH.", "Why are you giving your cousins a pile of gifts anyway? You\u2019re barely an adult yourself. If you want to give gifts, one each is sufficient.but you don\u2019t need to comment on how many kids they have- it\u2019s not like the baby will be here by Christmas anyway, so it shouldn\u2019t make any difference this year. \n\nStop giving animals gifts- they don\u2019t care. Stop the excessive gift giving to cousins. You don\u2019t need to announce why you\u2019re not giving as many, just don\u2019t give as many! \n\nStop commenting on their reproductive choices. It\u2019s none of your business. \n\nESH- them for grilling you about gifts- that\u2019s greedy. And you for using your gift giving as a way to criticize their choices- which is none of your business.", "What the heck?!  You are 20!  Stop buying presents for all the animals, and one present a kid is fine.  You don\u2019t have to bankrupt yourself for presents!", "tbh you could have just dropped down to one present once they do have a kid plus chances are with her being 40 she\u2019s more likely to have multiples so you\u2019d have to go down on gifts as it is", "Nta", "ESH. You for not minding your business, aunt and uncle for bringing more kids they can't afford into the world, particularly for the shitty patriarchal reason of requiring a male child. I feel sorry for the daughters, I feel sorry for the pets, and I dislike literally all of the human adults.", "maybe it is her business if she feels the kids are already in a sort of not good situation with the house being so small? sounds like maybe they can\u2019t afford another kid and she\u2019s concerned for the well being of all the kids involved. i\u2019m sure i\u2019ll get downvoted for this NTA just because someone can have a kid doesn\u2019t mean they should, i think her opinion here is somewhat valid if she feels the kids aren\u2019t being taken care of properly/provided proper space to live comfortably. i suppose i agree that the xmas gifts were a weird way of going about saying that though", "Nta. You are 20. It sounds like your family is toxic. They shouldnt care how many, if any, presents you get for any of there kids. Dont get anyone anything and go on a vacation. Lol", "OP you are both AH and NTA at the same time. AH because, you set a judgemental condition for giving a gifts. If money was a problem you could just call them and tell them due to this you\u2019re giving them one present and none for the pets. And that\u2019s all. Your finance, your decision. \nNTA for the concern for the kids if they actually have the conditions to raise them. Also \u201cgod always finds a way\u201d is an absolute bullshit. And just for that your aunt is the worst AH in this situation. I have friends within the Christian community and most of them are rational and know that \u201cgod\u2019s help\u201d is not reliable enough to make another baby and then pray for food.", "For so many reasons already listed, YTA 100%", "YTA. How many kids, renovating or buying a bigger house is none of your business.  Now, you don't have to buy them all gifts.  This set up seems like everyone depends on you to provide Christmas gifts for the children.  I don't understand why the one relative is asking how many presents his children will get. Anyhow, you are overstepping. Just buy what you want the kids to have without putting yourself in a financial bind.", "You plan a fixed budget per family. Its upon them what they want within that. NTA", "Just because your family doesn\u2019t mean you should have bankrupt your self to get gifts for nieces and nephew.\n\nIt has be reasonable and as long as you treat them equally that what matters.\n\nI come from a large family, I have 15 cousins m, not mention current have 4 generations of family. We don\u2019t get together like we used to.\n\nGrowing up, we often spent Christmas together, there a clear agreement that aunt/uncles if they couldn\u2019t afford to buy gifts, didn\u2019t matter as long as they spent time with family. \n\nFor those who felt able to give gift, they would choose to either birthday or Christmas gift not both and there was expectation that it should be a small non expensive gift. At the end of the day, it was about the thought behind it that mattered ii\n\nYou can\u2019t control Ann and her choices, you asked how they would accommodate a new baby/child and she avoided the question.", "INFO: why did you feel the need to anticipate this? \nAlso- did I understand correctly that you are buying presents for Ann\u2019s pets, too?", "I've never known of anyone other than parents getting children 2-3 presents each anyway. You don't actually have to get them anything, and 1 present each is fine (as long as they all get the same amount of presents). No one has the right to tell you that you are an arsehole for this, it is up to you and only you if you get them presents and how many presents you want to or can afford to get for them. You aren't an asshole, it's entitled behaviour, on their part.", "Oooohhhhhh, ffs. \n\nWe have 6 kids. All girls (one is FTM but was raised as a girl.) \n\nBefore September, we lived in a 3 br home with 1 bathroom. 1 toilet. \n\nIt was tight, yes, but no one is worse for wear! No one was harmed from sharing their space. \n\nOur new home is 3500+ sq ft, 2.5 baths and everyone has their own room. It took 2 FULL months before the kids started sleeping in their own rooms consistently. \n\nAt least 3 days a week I have to hunt down a kid bc they slept with a sister. \n\nYour opinion on house size is irrelevant- and stupid. \n\nAnd you\u2019re disgusting for policing a woman\u2019s reproductive choices. \n\nYTA.", "You could of just kept that comment to yourself.  That wasn't an AH comment it was a DICK comment.  It's not your place to have any say in how many kids they have (regardless of their reasons). Just get the kids 1 thing each or nothing at all. You get to decide who and what you buy for gifts.", "YTA\n\nAlso I\u00b4m super confused about this time line:\n\nYou said you had your aunts wedding party this weekend and she announced she was trying for a baby.\n\nYou rang her and said if she has this baby you will only get one present this year. \n\nSo your aunt is not pregnant yet, you are saying if she has the baby. you do realise they cook for like 9 months no way is she having a baby in time for Xmas.   \n\n\nOr is she Already pregnant and your giving her a weird ultimatum like if you have the baby the kids only get one present. What is her other option abortion and they can get 2-3 presents.   \n\n\nFml this is so weird.  \n\n\nAlso why are you so weird about how many Xmas presents people get Xmas is about love,joy, happiness give what you want no one should be a dick about it.", "YTA for saying it like it was a condition. You've basically given her an ultimatum and it isn't your place to do so. You should have left it alone, got them 1 present each and left it at that. I will add anyone who is annoyed that their kids only get one gift from a family member are also AH,the entitlement boggles my mind. What happened to being grateful for whatever you are given?", "You can buy the kids 1 or 10 presents. That is totally your choice. YTA (at 20 yo) to basically tell your aunt that you don't approve of her having any more children. You can have your opinion but keep it to yourself.", ">it very easily went over \u00a3200 and nearly crippled me financially\n\nSo don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s as simple as that.", "on the fence but NTA. However, you really shouldn't have said anything about the number of gifts and just quietly skipped the pets. If anyone was rude enough to ask, you laugh and say I'm switching things up this year, because what you decide to do with gifts is no one's business but yours. Which is true - you make the choice what to buy. Just maybe no need to broadcast it.", "Oops forgot to judge you.  Umm. YTA for overstepping and making your aunt's (maybe stupid) decision to have another baby about you buying xmas gifts. Wayyyy out of line. That being said? NTA for not wanting to buy your cousin's 3 gifts a piece.  I'm not sure if that was an expectation set by them or a choice you made... If you had lots of disposable income it would make more sense, but clearly you're stressing your budget as it is.   Just chill out on the life advice and excessive gifts.", "I mean it's to say OP doesn't approve. It's a weird reaction. Unless there's some prior agreement to what is bought I'm not sure why you would bother mentioning it.", "I usually give the dogs something for Christmas too, but it's just some treats or a toy for each but nothing expensive or over the top. But why do OPs aunts guinea pigs need something special? If it's a small treat it's okay, but everything more expensive like a hide out or something should be treated as a gift for the owner, not the pets.", "It's not OP's pets it's aunt's pets.", "But they won't fit anymore. They're sharing bedrooms now *and*can't fit in one room at the same time.", "Hamster did nothing wrong, he deserves his presents lol", "[removed]", "To bad. If this new kid makes a crappy situation crappier, they deserve to hear how they might hurt their current children.", "Best gift for dogs: Get an old pair of jeans, cut into thick strips, braid it, knot the ends. Extra brownie points if you stuff kibble into the braid as you go.", "I kind of go over the top for my dog, but he's *my dog* and I can afford it. My dog's bff and other pets in the family usually just get a toy if I get them something. Anyway, OP is absolutely not an AH for choosing to get the kids one gift each, and she wouldn't be even if she did this and still gave the pets presents, it's her prerogative and, as she said, they're also gifts for the kids, it's not like she thinks the hamster will feel left out otherwise. I do think informing her aunt of this was a weird, passive aggressive move to express her disapproval, but I find it even weirder that her aunt and her uncle are upset at her *only* getting one gift per child. If they want their children to get more gifts, they should just get them themselves instead of relying on their 20yo niece to do it.", "she said she does it more for the kids which I think is sweet (make it more magical for htem or whatnot) but no reason she can't stop", "Even more reason to not give them gifts. Ffs", "Bot", "but that wasn\u2019t even OP\u2019s concern, it was their own personal finances that led them to this decision. while i don\u2019t necessarily think OP\u2019s perspective is wrong if someone called me up out of nowhere to tell me \u201ci can only afford to give your kids one gift each\u201d that wouldn\u2019t automatically make me rethink having another child.", "The older dog loves tow toys but it should be extremely durable since playtime can get ruff with him and he gets spun around in the air as best as I can. And the younger dog is into squeaky toys but they tend to break sooner or later so that's what she's getting. At least they calmed down a bit because at the beginning you had to give them the excact same toy or they'd fight over it."]}
