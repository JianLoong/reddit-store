Buy whatever gifts within your budget you feel like. If it is one gift per child, the  so be it. But there's no reason to have a discussion about it or act judgy towards her.

Because if they didn't, then you literally just called someone trying for a baby out of the blue and told them that them having another baby would be inconvenient for you...\n\nThere was no need at all to tell her that. It not only implied that you disapprove of her having another child, but also that you are considering her a financial burden already. What was your goal? Did you want her to reconsider having another child? Did you want her to feel guilty for essentially reducing her other children's Christmas presents? Did you want her to allow you to spend less on her family? I can't think of any reason for that phonecall that makes sense.\n\nAgain, unless she specifically asked for it, you aren't obligated to do any of this.

Calling ahead to say you\u2019d be giving fewer gifts is not a good move to begin with.

I know you meant well but it was pretty rude to actually call your aunt up and do that. What they do in their marriage is their business. It's not yours. 1 baby or 15- it doesn't make a difference either way. It's not up to you to call it out. I think one gift per child is reasonable moving forward.
