I asked her to get the gate when I was driving a golf cart and she refused to get her ass up and said bs like \"I don't see a way to open it,\" \"how do you even know it opens,\" and \"it's rusted\" and only opened it when I raised my voice. Towards the end of the shift on the third day, she just sat down to talk on the phone again. I asked her to pick something up (6 times). She refused to get up until I told my boss I'm almost done and if she needs something else.\n\nI have a feeling my other coworker said my classmate isn't working out (later confirmed by my boss). He and another coworker really liked me and said I'll probably stick around.\n\nI got a text from my boss telling me that before she texts my classmate, she wanted me to know that she isn't working out. I said that's fine and was planning on talking to her about it anyway.\n\nMy classmate called and started complaining about how she got fired. She was crying and saying how she's a \"hard worker\" so she doesn't understand why she's let go. I was annoyed but after a few minutes I tried to end the call by saying I had to go. I hung up but she kept calling me. After the 3rd time I picked up and told her exactly why she wasn't working out. She's constantly complaining, lacks initiative even though there's a list, on her phone too much, and refuses to see that she's the problem.\n\nShe was crying harder when she hung up.

She wasn\u2019t going to stop calling you until you laid it out for her. Based on your description, it sounds like she is a terrible co-worker and is delusional about her work ethic. Someone had to tell her the truth. Hopefully, she learns her lesson.", "NTA.  So long as OP didn't tell her anything the boss said to them in confidence.  Don't know her age, but I will assume this is a first job situation for the friend.  Hopefully they learn something from the experience.", "NTA she needs to know why and maybe she can take the initiative to correct her behavior at the next job she gets", "NTA It\u2019s understandable that she cried but she\u2019s lucky to have a friend on the inside who could honestly explain what happened, rather than just \u201cit\u2019s not working out, you\u2019re fired\u201d.  She now has the information to not make the same mistake again.", "NTA,  Sometimes the truth hurts.", "NTA It's her behavior and her obliviousness to it that is going to lead to this crying sequence on repeat if she does this at her next job and her next. You can't make her wake up to herself, but you gave her the chance to.", "NTA.  She needed a wake-up call if she thought she was a \"hard worker.\"  Glad your boss had the stones to let her go quickly.", "NTA. She's never had a job before, has she?\n\nShe's obviously not a hard worker, and equally obviously doesn't have any concept of what \"hard work\" actually is. \n\nClue: just because her body is present at her place of employment doesn't mean that she's actually accomplishing anything.", "NTA Idk your ages but she sounds immature. It hurts being fired, it\u2019s actually a good sign that she\u2019s distressed rather than angry. Hopefully she\u2019s open to constructive criticism and will use this as a learning experience.", "NTA\n\n\nYou stuck your neck out for her and she did you dirty.

Don't worry about it.", "NTA \n\nBe more selective about recommending friends for jobs unless you know something of their professional skills", "NTA. In the moment she will be hurt and maybe even angry, but with enough time hopefully your words will evoke a change in her.", "NTA.\n\nHer own lack of work etiquette is why she was fired and she wants to blame others.", "I mean, I don't know how you worded it, so maybe you could've said things better, but ultimately you may have done her a favor. I sorta doubt she was willing to listen, but if she did this could be a wakeup call for her before she ruins another job.

You put reality into her and she needed it. YNTA", "NTA, and I feel really irritated reading about her.  I had jobs when I was younger where other people were always expecting me to pick up their slack, and of course I had to do it, or we would never get the job done.  It's good you were honest with her, and probably good that it made her cry.  Maybe she'll reconsider her work ethic.", "NTA", "NTA. Hopefully you've learned that when you recommend someone for a job, that it puts you in the crosshairs good and bad.", "NTA! She knows it you know it we all know it! Great life lesson for her! You actually have to WORK at a job or you get fired! Too bad she didn\u2019t know this already!", "I did the same thing with a friend. I got her an interview that should\u2019ve landed her the job no problem (I talked her up a lot to my manager and we were desperate). \n\nDuring the interview, my manager asked when she\u2019d be willing to work. My friend (who was in high school with me) told her \u201cnot weekends because that\u2019s when my boyfriend takes me out on dates. I\u2019d prefer to work a couple school nights, but not too many and only for two or three hours per shift.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say she didn\u2019t get the job. And I was super embarrassed because she told me she didn\u2019t have anything going on, so she could work whenever as long as it didn\u2019t interfere with school. I haven\u2019t given her a referral since.", "NTA and in the future, be very particular about who you'll recommend for jobs. I am 40 years old and have met exactly 5 people I would recommend for a job. Two of them are now a manager and a business consultant for my company so they don't need my analyst recommendation LOL I take work pretty seriously in that I never want to make others look bad... I've seen so many people not care (no matter their age) that I struggle to understand how they bother getting these jobs if they don't want to do them! I'm not letting anyone attach my name to that behavior, it makes me look bad too!", "NTA, she needs to hear the hard truth now.", "I don\u2019t recommend friends for a job I\u2019m currently working anymore. Did it once and it went horribly wrong. Luckily didn\u2019t reflect poorly on me but we definitely stopped being friends.", "NTA if she doesn't learn from this, she is just going to repeat it over and over for the rest of her working life.", "NTA. She needed to be told. Hopefully she will learn something from this.", "NTA Sometimes the truth hurts.", "Thank God my boss still likes me..."]}
