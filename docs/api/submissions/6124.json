She's never had a job before, has she?\n\nShe's obviously not a hard worker, and equally obviously doesn't have any concept of what \"hard work\" actually is. \n\nClue: just because her body is present at her place of employment doesn't mean that she's actually accomplishing anything.", "NTA Idk your ages but she sounds immature.

I had jobs when I was younger where other people were always expecting me to pick up their slack, and of course I had to do it, or we would never get the job done.

I got her an interview that should\u2019ve landed her the job no problem (I talked her up a lot to my manager and we were desperate). \n\nDuring the interview, my manager asked when she\u2019d be willing to work. My friend (who was in high school with me) told her \u201cnot weekends because that\u2019s when my boyfriend takes me out on dates. I\u2019d prefer to work a couple school nights, but not too many and only for two or three hours per shift.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say she didn\u2019t get the job.

She didn't do her job, and someone needed to lay it out for her. \n\nIn some workplaces, her BS would have got you fired too, for having recommended her (yes, I know that's not legal, but it happens sometimes and usually there is little recourse when it does).", "NTA", "NTA. It sounds like you set a boundary by trying to get off the phone with her, and she ignored it. You were frustrated and honestly, you just told her the truth. I'm sure you would have worded it differently had she not bulldozed that boundary, but telling her allows her the opportunity to reflect and change her behavior.

But i think your boss should have explained why she got fired?", " NTA \n\nThis is why I don\u2019t recommend people for jobs unless I already absolutely know how they are going to be a decent employee.

I was that teacher that has a great relationship with my students and they come to me for a lot, but they know Im also a teacher that doesn\u2019t play and shoots it straight when needed with kindness because I care to teach them what real life is like.

How did you know?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cBecause you are always late to my class (I had him 1st hr) and are constantly on your phone! I told you long ago bosses won\u2019t have patience for it. I can\u2019t give you consequences for it but your boss will.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cMiss, I thought you were just exaggerating and trying to scare me.

You can send a dumb phone to school that she won't want to play with.", "Some people think that being somewhere they don't want to be, doing something they don't want to do make them a hard worker.
