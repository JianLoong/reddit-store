It sounds like your mom is just trying to take the easy way out of parenting your sister tbh.\n\nTo keep your special items safe make sure you hide them somewhere rather than keeping them out. Mom may try to take it while you\u2019re out or at school.\n\nGood luck sweetie\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, it's yours. Your mom shouldn't take without asking. Plus if she has a ton of her own toys mom should have gone with that.\n\nA baby will cry over many things and who knows if your item would have stopped her throwing up.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to your own toys.  Your mom should not expect you to give away your belongings.\n\nIt's not your fault.", "NTA\n\nYou are not your siblings mom. Why your mother even went into your room to get a toy is beyond me. Blaming your for your sister throwing up it being a common thing is not your fault. It is a concerning that it is a regular thing tbh. Why not try to comfort your sister and try to stop her crying some other way? (Shitty parenting)", "NTA\n\nIt's important for parents to teach their kids to share. That's different than *forcing* their kids to share.\n\nIt's also important that you learn how to set appropriate boundaries, even with your parents or your sister. Your mother should be teaching you how to do that correctly, not blocking you from doing it at all.\n\nNot every parent is perfect 24/7. Hopefully this is a one-off and not a pattern of behavior from her.", "NTA.  This is your mom's responsibility.  She also doesn't have a right to your stuff.", "Well, grabbing someone else\u2019s stuff is a terrible precedence for making someone calm down. \n\nNTA. Offer to take the kid out for a walk/excursion and get them something silly of their very own so you can make a memorable gift/shared experience, that way they get the idea of \u201csomething might be actually important to someone, even if it seems absurd or meaningless to someone else.\u201d \n\nAnd look up some toddler-tamer techniques, mom!", "NTA. I would say it\u2019s mom because definitely AH behavior. She was wrong and unkind and lacking compassion. But, having had 2 children, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a pattern. 2 year olds can be real assholes and mom does anything to get a minute of silence. She was so wrong. If it makes sense feel better, mom is going to pay for this for years to come. Guaranteed. The only thing worse than a toddler tantrum is a teenage girl tantrum.", "NTA-Your mom needs to be considerate of you.  She could have easily picked up a different toy. The actions of your little sister is not your fault and you are not to blame for it.", "Nope ,ur toy. You keep it", "NTA. Sentimental things are not shared unless you wish it. Yeah, the toddler years suck (been there, done that) but giving in to a tantrum is not the way to cope with it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If it\u2019s of sentimental value to you, and breakable, then your mother shouldn\u2019t have taken it and tried to give it to her without your permission. Your mother might need help with your little sister though because it sounds like she\u2019s struggling, so maybe you could spend some time with her and distract her by playing silly games with her.", "NTA Why did your mom come into your room in the first place. (Not that she needs a reason) It is just odd.", "INFO: What kind of toy was it? Something fragile or a teddy bear, for example, that your mom could keep her eyes on to make sure your sister doesn't break and calm her down at the same time? (Just for curiosity)\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, NTA. Regardless of age, we all have the right to keep sentimental objects that represented something in our lives, and most of the time, they are more valuable than expensive things, as they are irreplaceable. I'm sure this isn't the only object in the house capable of distracting your sister.", "NTA I (54 yo mother of 3 daughters) don\u2019t care who bought the toy for you. She was wrong to expect you to get it to the baby. She is creating a spoiled brat. Surprised you turned out normal.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your possession and your mom has no right to take something that doesn\u2019t belong to her without asking. It\u2019s her job to calm your distressed sister. She was wrong to blame you for your sister continuing to cry and throw up.", "NTA. This toy is important to you, it is yours, it is not your responsibility. You have every right to keep it.", "NTA. A rightfully disgraced comedian with the initials BC said it best - \u201cParents aren\u2019t interested in justice. They want quiet.\u201d", "NTA. They're your belongings. Your mom was out of line to come into your room and take something to give to a 2 year old.", "NTA. She doesn't just get to barge into your room and grab your possessions to hand to an angry toddler. Boundaries are a thing. If I where you, I'd put that toy hidden out of sight and anything else you don't want your sister into as your mom has already proven that she won't respect your possessions and space.", "Yes, you are the AH. She's a kid that needed your compassion and you screwed it. Man. Really?", "NTA\n\nYour mum acted out of stress re blaming you so don't take it personally.\n\nYou could say you can look after it but be careful. \n\nMy best way to get the kid to stop crying at that age is to ask if they want a hug.\n\nIf you offer help more your mum will be less stressed and appreciative of the help. \n\nIt's really hard when they're at age and have nightmares, it's really hard on you not getting sleep. \n\nHelp out and reap the benefits of a less stressed mum and a nice environment.", "NTA. OP, my petty advice would be to start taking your mom's things and showing them to your sister and getting her excited about it. If your mom stops you and your sister gets upset, tell your mom it's her fault for not giving her it.\n\nBut don't really do that, lol. You're a minor and reliant on your mom.", "100% agree.\n\nNTA Op and you have every right to your possessions. \n\nMy guess is your Mom reached a point of desperation with the crying. Especially if your little sister routinely pukes from crying too hard.", "It's a stuffed duck", "Wtf xD Like a baby even knows what was happening and was just upset. How do we know the toy would have stopped the cry puke?", "I highly doubt a 2 year old needed a teenager\u2019s \u2018compassion\u2019. Probably needed a bloody nap and some cuddles off their mother. But at any rate, taking someone else\u2019s belongings and giving them to a child who didn\u2019t know the item existed five minutes previously is not the answer.", "Nta she doesn't have to give her sister her own toys if she doesn't want to", "Wow.", "Lmao I\u2019m glad you said at the end not to do this, when I just saw the quick preview before opening Reddit I got very concerned\ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s quacking adorable", "NTA, I would suggest hiding the stuffed duck as I can see mom trying to give the toy to your sibling again. Also not your fault baby vomited.", "NTA. But oh my gosh at first glance I thought it said you were 41 with a 2 year old sister and I was very concerned.", "NTA.  It's yours and your sister is your mom's baby, not yours.", "NTA. If your sister is so upset by not getting a toy she wants that she throws up, there\u2019s already a serious issue. Giving a 2 yo a toy to stop a tantrum is likely not the right move most of the time either. (If you scream, I\u2019ll do anything to stop you is a bad message)\n\nIs there a trusted adult you can speak to? Sounds like your mom is overwhelmed and needs help", "nta and make sure to find a safe place for it because it might go missing.", "NTA my mother did that a few times to me. I'm much older now, and she's been gone a long time now, but i still miss what she gave away.", "NTA, but it sounds like your mom needs to actively sit down and play and teach your sister while playing. Your sister needs stimulation for her brain. And wants someone to be with. Not just given a toy and left to play.", "So she could give her sister a hug. Not her possessions"]}
