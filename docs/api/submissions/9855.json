I hope you guys, or at least her get some help soon.", "YTA, obviously. This is really strange and controlling behavior. Your gf is absolutely right. Your lack of trust and respect for her basic privacy is a problem. If you don't want people in *your* house, that is your right. A bit excessive, but your house, your rules. But if you share a house and/or you have moved into someone else's house (from your post, sounds like you moved into gf 's house?), you need to be more cooperative and mindful of the balance required for cohabitation. You say you both don't like people in the house, but your AITA post begs to differ. It sounds like the whole problem is that you have this preference and she does not. \n\nThat all being said, this is more an issue with trust and respect than a preference for privacy. If you trust and respect your girlfriend, you ought to be able to get over whatever discomfort you feel about people being in the house. Asking that no one come over and then installing security cameras to catch her is wildly controlling and honestly, paranoid behavior. Not to mention, if you're worried about what she's doing when you're not around, this is unlikely to address that concern. More likely, she will find other ways to do what she wants without you finding out...that is, if she doesn't leave you first. \n\nA home should be a safe space for all who inhabit it. It sounds like both of you are not feeling safe and your solution is to prioritize your own comfort over hers and it is going to create far bigger issues if the underlying problem is not addressed. Do you distrust her, as a person or do you have an excessive paranoia about visitors, in general? I don't like people in my house either. Not because I don't trust them... just because I just don't like people much. My partner and I let each other know if there will be company over (which admittedly, is not often because we don't like people much), but I cannot imagine disallowing him from having people over or installing cameras to monitor him and his visitors. If you don't trust her ability to discern if someone is going to steal your stuff, or you don't trust what she will do with visitors when you're not there, that is an issue no amount of cameras can fix.   \n\nAnd 10 hours is a ton of time to sleep.", "Wait a minute - you move into your gf's house, and now you get to decide that it's not okay for her to have a friend over?  To her place?  What the ever loving ridiculousness is this?  OP YTA for that, and that alone.  Then going beyond to install cameras that your gf is not allowed access to - that's next level AH behavior.  Why your gf doesn't kick you to the curb, will remain a mystery to me.  I see your edit, but I still see red flags all over your post and hopefully your gf is paying close attention too.  She should be re-considering this entire relationship.", "YTA. This is essentially what your post says:  I have a girlfriend but I don\u2019t think she yet realizes how jealous, controlling, and insecure I really am. These major character flaws lead me to not trust her at all. I don\u2019t allow her to have anyone over, not even a single girlfriend because I\u2019m so insecure. I thought it would be a great idea to spy on her so I bought a camera from Amazon. We have a Ring system that works perfectly but it doesn\u2019t allow me to spy on her in our house. She was not happy about the camera so I LIED to her and said it was for physical security purposes. Now that I\u2019ve typed this all out, I can see clearly that I am TA! I\u2019m going to do the right thing. I\u2019m going to come clean and tell her about my major character flaws and tell her that she deserves someone so much better\u2026someone who can trust her, won\u2019t lie to her, someone who will let her have a friend two.", "YTA. Good lord, if your trust issues are that extreme, you're not ready for a relationship. Any relationship.\n\nFor the record, we do have internal and external cameras. Initially it was to alert us in case my elderly MIL were to have another dangerous fall. Now that she's in senior housing, it helps check in on our pets (one is a relatively new rescue pup).

Why would your gf, who you supposedly trust enough to live with, let her guests touch your things? If you have anything uniquely expensive get a locking safe for it.  I can understand not wanting to host guests, 100%.. and I know I hate people touching my stuff, but at the same time, when my girlfriends come over w/o permission they do not go anywhere near my husband's stuff. My friends are not assholes.  Are you hiding something or are you just territorial? Can you instead just outline things that have ACTUALLY BEEN A PROBLEM and address them? Have you considered that you may have anxiety ( if it's not control issues, giving you the benefit of the doubt here)   We have cameras in our house but they shut down when someone comes home, except the outside ones.

In short you have some trust issues, and you need to sort your feelings out before you can commit to a person.
