No one gets dibs on parking spaces.  I've pushed a lady out of the way with my car once because she thought she could \"hold\" the spot for her friends who were still circling the lot.  Nope.  Take your entitlement back home and leave us in peace.", "NTA. At first I thought this was gonna be an instance where the other vehicle is coming the opposite direction and had been waiting for the spot prior to your arrival. Some AHs will take the spot if the car departing pulls out in a way to allow them to park before the car who was already there waiting. In this case, a vehicle behind you who arrived at that space after you is not entitled to that space.", "NTA\n\n> \u201cthat guy asked me for the space\u201d \n\nIt's not hers to give.\n\n> I just said \u201csorry that\u2019s now how it works, my car is here first so I\u2019m taking it\u201d.\n\nYes. This is the way. \\^\\^\\^\\^\\^", "NTA\n\nFirst come first served. You did nothing wrong & that guy was trying it on.", "NTA. \n\nThat space wasn\u2019t the lady\u2019s to give. As soon as she leaves, it\u2019s first come first serve like every other space. \n\nIf you hadn\u2019t taken it the car behind you would have and he STILL wouldn\u2019t get it himself.", "NTA. How dare this person attempt to disrupt the sacred queuing system!", "NTA - is this an episode of Seinfeld?", "There will always be some people who will push to get as much as they can because most people are unwilling to argue (especially with a stranger who might be crazy). \n\nYou are NTA. He had no right to that spot because he saw it from a distance, while you were right there waiting.", "NTA. You don't get dibs on a parking space you aren't next in line for. Them's the breaks.", "NTA.  The only time that is acceptable is places like where I work with enormous parking lots.  You drive around and see another employee leave one of the buildings and ask them if you can drive them to their car so you can have their spot.  It's a win win and everyone is happy.", "NTA, but that other guy sure was.", "NTA, first person in the space gets it, shouting from several cars back does not reserve it", "NTA.  This reminds me of when I was in elementary school and kids would invite other kids to jump the line by getting in *behind* them.  I'm sure that poor lady only agreed  with him to shut him up.\n\nIf that dude wants a guaranteed parking place, he can come to an arrangement with the store owners.", "NTA - it is not a thing in the UK. It is the person with the car in the right position that gets the space. No idea what the woman was talking about nor the person trying to sneak in.

I guess we've all forgotten the phrase, \"First come, first serve.\" : meaning a group of people or things will be dealt with or ***given something in the order in which they arrive.*** So, asking someone for the the spot, not how it works buddy. You getting to the spot first doesn't make you an AH, this isn't a game of \"I called shotgun!!\" \n\nIf it was a handy-cap spot and you took from disabled people, you would FS be an AH because it's illegal and those people have a LEGAL right to park there. In the way OP described it, that isn't the case here.", "It technically could be her space to give if she really wanted to. All she\u2019d have to do is tell OP that she\u2019s giving that space to the other guy and sit in her car until OP moved on.

Unless the car park has attendants it's Lord of the Flies.", "Yes?\n\nI mean, you can coordinate with your friend so they're *ready* to grab your spot when you leave. But you don't get to \"reserve\" it for them.\n\nIf another car gets ahead of them, too bad.", "NTA If that\u2019s how it works I call permanent dibs on every spot next to the closest cart corral to the door in perpetuity.", "If the car was a few cars back he would not possibly get it anyways. The car behind you would likely take it.", "NTA.  This must be the guy who held a spot in the checkout line while his wife was coming with the trolley."]}
