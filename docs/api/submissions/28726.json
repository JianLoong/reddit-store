She believes in tarot cards, palmistry, crystal energy and all that sort of crazy stuff.\n\nHe started to bring her to group meetups & she seemed like a relatively chill person, she was just chatting and smoking some pot and stuff. One time when I was at Lewis\u2019 house though she started to ask me what my zodiac sign is & telling me what crystals \u201cmatch my energy\u201d. There was another time when one of our other friends was going through a breakup, and she just straight up said to him \u201ci guess that\u2019s what happens when a Virgo dates a Aries\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s just my personal opinion that anyone who believes in this stuff probably has a screw loose up there. But I didn\u2019t say anything cause that\u2019s his girlfriend. She started to talk about this shit more and more. \n\nI invited Lewis round to my house one day and when he arrived his GF was there too. I wasn\u2019t rude or anything, but also wasn\u2019t super friendly to her because I didn\u2019t even invite her. For a while we were watching a movie, until she pulled out a pack of those tarot cards.\n\nShe started telling me that she wanted to give me a reading, I said no thanks. But she started pushing saying that she just wants to see what my reading comes out as. I think the fact that this was in MY house and that I hadn\u2019t even invited her made me fly off the handle, and I ended up saying loud, but not shouting at all, \u201cI have a reading for you : stop with this shit and get real\u201d.\n\nShe asked if I was being serious and Lewis thought I was joking. I kept a straight face and said I wasn\u2019t, and that I was fed up with all this psycho shit. His gf started crying & calling me names and Lewis said \u201cwhy are you being such a dick\u201d before leaving.\n\nA few other friends that know us all have literally agreed with me, saying that she tries to push that shit on anyone and they\u2019re fed up too. But some others say that I should have just let her do it to get it over and done with. AITA?\n\nTL;DR - My best friend\u2019s GF believes in crazy spirituality shit. When she tried to give me a tarot card reading, i said no but she kept pushing. i finally told her \u201cI have a reading for you : stop this shit and get real\u201d. They got upset, but some of my friends don\u2019t blame me. AITA?\n\nEdit because I forgot to mention and someone\u2019s comment made me remember : I don\u2019t know if this is true or not but Lewis has said to us once that his GF has some kind of personality disorder but wouldn\u2019t specify what.

People are bilked out of a lot of money believing in this stuff. Also, some of the beliefs are pretty offensive to people of other faiths.

Next time try and enforce your boundaries without unnecessarily insulting people.", "I grew up with seances and tarot reading going on in my house because my mom went to a Psychic Spiritualist church.  She'd have people come over to do readings and such.  I was always being told about my Indian Spirit Guide, because all dead Indians have fuck all to do in the afterlife but guide a chubby elementary school nerdling.  So, my point is, this shit is annoying, but even everyone who came to my mom's psychic parties would say she's in the wrong for insisting once you said no.  Very much a no-no.  She sounds like she needs help.  Not your job.  Not your monkey, not your circus.  BUT, there's no reason to be a dick at that point.  She insisted, be firm and consistent.  Instant escalation and personal attacks are why you might be an asshole, but I'm still going with NTA because I have no patience for people like her.", "NTA. It is no different than any other belief set being pushed on you...and because hers are also rooted in beliefs that directly conflict with more mainstream religions, it's even more problematic. You asked her to stop...you told her no...she ignored what you wanted. NTA.\n\nFor people who want to somehow blame you, they should think of it like someone who is gay having a person who is an extreme Christian attempting to force the gay person to listen to Scripture.

Who are you to say anything about it when you know nothing about it?  It's called being tactful and you completely missed the mark and it may cause quite a rift in the friendship you have with Lewis.  All the best, OP.", "ESH \n\nShe should have accepted a no from the outset, then none of this would have happened. But you also clearly have an extreme dislike her that isn\u2019t supported by anything she\u2019d actually don\u2019t wrong prior to that. That obviously clouded your opinion and how you reacted. \n\nAnd to be clear whether you were wrong or right, consider that you\u2019ve probably lost Lewis as a friend for at least a little while.", "Nta you guys have different beliefs but if she keeps pushing then that makes her the AH. She is being pushy and that's not a way to make someone feel comfortable especially in their own home. You made one comment because of her persistence.", "NTA, she was pushy.  I'm into all that woo-woo shit but respecting boundaries is basic human adult interaction", "NTA - as people have mentioned here, substitute this for any organised religion and there\u2019s gonna be a lot more uproar about her attitude. Letting it slide just encourages the behaviour. No means no, and having someone not take no for an answer is stepping over boundaries. Why should OP owe her a nicer attitude when she\u2019s been overstepping boundaries left and right?", "You were right to stand your ground, bro, but \u201cno thanks\u201d would have been enough.

A simple no thanks and then, when she continued, you could have politely, but firmly declined saying that you don't believe in that and have no interest in it. Some will tell you (like your friends) that since she pushed, you get to be rude AF to her. That's one way to go through life, but being a little more polite is the way to go IMHO.", "NTA, first she wasn\u2019t even invited to your place.

But she\u2019s the one who insists on pushing it on everyone else.", "NTA - Its bad enough she just shows up at people's houses uninvited, but the pushing her spiritual beliefs on everyone is just icing on the cake. This is the equivalent of a Christian constantly trying to talk about their religion and convert people, if people can't accept a polite no thanks than you are justified in using less polite measures", "NTA with a dash of A H. If she asked and you told her no, that should be the end of it. While you're the best judge of what was necessary to get your point across, I do think you could have handled it a lot more tactfully (that's where the dash of A H comes in). It is possible to be firm without being mean.", "NTA don't enable this delusional shit especially when they are pushing it on you that much", "Show me where in the DSM it says that one of the symptoms of a diagnosable MH disorder, is other people being an asshole?\n\nIt's one thing to set a boundary about another person pushing their beliefs on you, but a total AH move to imply that her spiritual beliefs are caused by or correlated with a diagnosis. You could have easily Googled the info if you wanted to know, but it's pretty clear you only added that part because you're TA.", "Just makes me think of how those MLM\u2019s people push their products on you. We each have different beliefs and I don\u2019t want to hear other peoples beliefs unless I ask. People are more than capable of doing their own research. They don\u2019t need to be bombarded by somebody with whatever it is they believe in.", "NTA\n\nShe's an evangelist. Fuck that", "Very slight AH as you could've been more tactful about it.\n\nThat said, she's also an AH for refusing to accept No for an answer.", "NTA. A lot of us dumb girls went through that magical witchy tarot phase. Some women I know are still pretty into it. But in no way is it okay for her to push it on people that don't want it. It'd be the same as reading scripture to her. \"Just let me pray for you.\" Something that she isn't into and doesn't want to be involved in and someone's pushing it on her. She needs to grow up. \n\nI mean, realistically, you could have had a talk with her when it all started and said that you weren't into that stuff and that you prefer not to have it around you before it got to a breaking point, but she sounds like she doesn't listen well either. Having a personality disorder has nothing to do with her tarot/crystal stuff. Plenty of 'practicing wiccans' are into a lot of what she is, but they aren't douches about it. \n\nNo means no. She needs to learn that. Regardless of the scenario, no always means no. I suggest you talk to your friend about it. You like him. You'd like to keep him as a friend, but he needs to have a conversation with his gf about her being so pushy with things. This isn't going to be the last time this happens. (The psycho comment was unwarranted, so you drifted into the ahole lane a bit there, but I get where it's coming from).\n\nIn general, you need to learn a bit more about communication, but she also needs to learn to not press stuff on people.", "Nta.

They all suck, and when they get pushy, should be reminded as such.\nEdit: poor wording", "Nta, it's your house and your friend brought her without asking. Even after shes trying to push her beliefs onto you. I'd be mad at your friend for that.

Why does what she believe in have to be \u201ccrazy stuff\u201d you sound closed minded. \n\nShe should have stopped when you said no; but you flying off the handle is shitty.

She's an asshole for obvious reasons: not taking \"no\" for an answer and offering her whacky bullshit when no one asked. You're an asshole for handling the situation poorly. You should have kept your cool and tried to have an adult conversation about the issue(s). \"You can believe whatever you want, but I don't believe it, and I don't like you forcing me to participate.\" If that failed, then maybe the swearing and belittling would be the next step.", "Nta\n\nShe is likely suffering from some sort of mental illness. Pandering to her won't help her. She needs to be encouraged to seek professional help.", "YTA You went straight to 'You're a crazy person!' instead of 'No thanks.

People like this can quickly become insufferable when they get pushy. I\u2019m totally fine with people believing whatever they want, but I have a serious problem when they start trying to drag me into their little circle of bullshit. Religious people are notorious for this, which is the main reason why I left all that behind me after being raised that way.", "Yup...", "ESH. Lewis should of left her home or said she would be coming too. She should have let it go when you said no and you for not having a sense of humor and being a dick. You don't like her but should remember that she is your bf gf and apologize to keep the peace.", "Nah any girl who believes in tarot cards, astrology, and crystals kick straight to the curb. Can\u2019t deal with that kind of idiocy. I\u2019d unironically prefer religion over that. At least that occasionally teaches morals. Witchy shit just teaches you how to be batshit crazy and blame the bad shit on the stars and bs.", "YTA\n\nY\u2019all were just watching a movie & you state you weren\u2019t being \u201csuper friendly\u201d because you didn\u2019t invite her. You were not pleasant before she even pulled out the cards. That\u2019s when you decided to be rude.\n\nDo you have any interests? Hobbies? Watch the news? \u2026. People talk about things they think are interesting & are interested in talking about. Helps people understand each other better & find things in common. Because you don\u2019t share the same interest as another person doesn\u2019t mean you should be rude to them. Maybe just listen & learn something new.", "YTA. Sometime believes in things you don't so you act like that. Furthermore, you put your friend in a shitty position. You're kind of a dick.", "I would have said E S H, but your attitude is so mean-spirited that I can't help but judge YTA. Just because you don't believe in spiritualism and metaphysics doesn't mean that you have the right to call people weird and crazy for it. Lots of people conform to metaphysical ways of thinking, and they're entitled to it if it's what they enjoy/believe in. But you don't get to be condescending and rude. Also, having a personality disorder literally has NOTHING to do with metaphysical interest.

The proper response when offered a Tarot reading when you don't want one is \"No thank you.\" Repeatedly if necessary. You do this because even if you don't like her, she is your mate's GF.

You went from 0 to 100 without any warning. You're valid in not wanting to participate in her beliefs but you could have communicated that you felt it was similar to someone pushing their religion on you first. The fact that both your friend and his GF thought you were joking at first indicates to me that neither knew you had an issue with her or her spirituality. No matter how obvious something seems to you, no one can read your mind.Even if you want to set a boundary that she not involve you in tarot readings, astrology charts, etc, you still owe her an apology.", "YTA\n\nThis is odd to you but it's very normal in some circles. When I lived in LA even otherwise rational people were super into healing crystals, tarot, astrology etc. \n\nYou're within your rights to say no but you could've been far more polite about setting the boundary. This is going to make her feel like you're just a meanie: it won't change how she acts w/r/t her tarot hobby.", "Just because you don\u2019t believe it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not real. Just like any religion, people believe what they want. \n\nESH\n\nShe was pushy & you were a jerk in how you handled it.", "ESH. She\u2019s pushy. You\u2019re touchy.", "ESH, she should have known her boundaries. You freaked out over something miniscule. Both of y'all need to grow up.", "ESH. She sounds super pushy, but you sound like you have a major chip on your shoulder. You would do better to bring yourself down a few notches. It wasn\u2019t necessary to be so rude.", "YTA Just view it as entertainment. You don't have to be a jerk about it.", "YTA You're entire post comes off as closed minded and arrogant. You're friends are right, you're a dick and they need to find a better friend.", "YTA", "ESH", "ETA, she should not be pushing her beliefs onto you and forcing you to get a reading, but you could have politely told her that you respect her beliefs but those are not your beliefs and that you prefer she not force you into a reading. If she ignored you and insisted, you could have asked her to leave your home since she is making you uncomfortable. But you totally disrespected her beliefs rather than her actions. \n\nI'm spiritual and read tarot but would never force someone to do a reading and don't force my beliefs on others. I also don't like being told that my beliefs are crazy when many cultures around the world read tarot and are spiritual. \n\nFor example, here in Thailand, people can read their fortune at the local Buddhist temple and have their tarot read in their neighborhood and it is not seen as weird or crazy because it's a part of the culture. There are also spirit houses in front of most buildings where Thai people leave offerings of food, drinks, and water to the spirits every day. \n\nSo calling spirituality and divination \"crazy\" because you don't believe in it is extremely disrespectful to millions of people and thousands of cultures around the world who have had those beliefs for hundreds to thousands of years. You don't need to believe in it, but you should respect other people's beliefs. If someone is forcing something on you, then focus on their actions, not their beliefs unless they're in some kind of cult that is hurting people.", "NTA - Even your aggressive response was to some one who kept trespassing your boundaries and demanding to be let in to your energy and process. You were kind when you politely declined. That's where it should have ended.   \n\n\nI have experienced God in meditation and prayer and I can tell you 100% your response was instinctually on point to some one violating your personal journey with their absolute horse shit. Just because they believe in it, doesn't mean it's anything more than a belief system. The power of humanity is the power OF belief/faith, not the systems themselves. If anyone tells you more then that, they misunderstand what it means to be the son/daughters of God.   \n\n\nDon't worry about people telling you to be kind about this nonsense, they don't understand the truth and think you owe some one who doesn't understand \"no\" any level of kindness beyond a bite to the face so they can learn their lesson from MUCH less intolerable people. Good on you for keeping your ground, especially in your own home.", "YTA. Her being pushy like this is annoying and all, but if you've never told her you're completely uninterested, you come off as a crazy person in this scenario. If you've told her clearly before you have zero interest, then N T A, but it seems from this post that this was the first time you said you don't like it, and you flew off the handle.", "YTA\n\nShe should have stepped off and not interacted with you because you seem very rude in the way you write this but she probably wanted to share a fun activity with you and you matched it with hostility and disrespecting her. If someone yelled at me saying \u201cStop with this shit and get real\u201d id probably laugh because of how ridiculous and lame you sound. \n\nYou should probably be careful though cause if I was her I\u2019d hex you.", "YTA I, too, would like to know why you were being such a dick", "YTA. Gemini, am I right? /s", "ESH\n\nHer for her constantly pushing her interests onto others and her inability to read the room. It's fine for her to be into whatever, but not everyone else is and she needs to learn that just because she likes a certain \"fragrance\" that doesn't mean she can spray it into the air or onto other people all the time as if everyone enjoys it as much as she does.\n\nBut your reaction didn't seem to be just down to that but more due to your dislike for her interests themselves. IMO this is why your emotional reaction focused on that: \"...stop with this shit and get real.\" If you had just focused on what was offensive in what she was doing \"Listen. I've told you repeatedly -- I don't want a reading. Please take no for an answer.\" then you could have dealt with the situation without targeting her beliefs. It seems to me that you had some disgust/frustration with her beliefs themselves (because you find them crazy) that had been building up pressure and that's why you responded with the words you used.", "I think you may have overreacted but you also literally had your boundary crossed (your own house, uninvited) and she pestered you. \n\nI don't have a problem with anyone's beliefs, providing they don't have a problem with mine.

I own 8 tarot decks because they\u2019re interesting and pretty, and I occasionally get a little esoteric and pull a card to start my day, or pull cards with another person\u2014 but I\u2019ve *never* asked anyone to engage with them more than once, because I understand it\u2019s something a lot of people aren\u2019t comfortable with. (An actual practitioner, which it sounds like this girl is, would be even more aware of the varying levels of comfort with the practice.) I also read my horoscope on the apps, but I have never blamed astrology for another person\u2019s real problems.\n\nAll of that to say, even if she *is* doing it just for fun, her behavior is inappropriate\u2014 and calling that out doesn\u2019t make me hot headed lol. You\u2019ll notice that in neither this comment nor my first did I endorse OP\u2019s specific reaction, so that observation was entirely misplaced. I commented on her behavior, not his.", "What broke the camels back was persistent disrespect, not that she asked but she refused to accept no for an answer, it doesn't matter that it was a belief of hers it matters that she wasn't willing to afford him common decently and he had to resort to lashing out for it to stop. Period. She didn't respect him politely so he became disrespectful, why are you so vehmentently defending such blatantly gross behavior? He didn't do shit wrong he defended an invasion of his comfort in the one place his comfort is priority.", "Not liking someone doesn't make you an asshole either. He's allowed to nit like someone.\n\nPushing your beliefs after you've been expressly told to stop? That does make you an asshole.", "I agree. He should not have reacted how he did when she pushed, but simply state that he does not share her beliefs and reiterate that he was uninterested in participating in her faith rituals. How he reacted was wrong, just as she was wrong for pushing her faith ritual on an uninterested party. ESH is the correct vote.", "I literally said that she should have known, if she's that into it, that she should have backed off. Regardless, her overstepping doesn't excuse his way over the line reaction. And my apologies, for lumping you in with the other commenter. I didn't realize you were a different person. I just assumed you were the same person going off on another tangent.\n\nStill, my whole point was that she was absolutely wrong, and he was even more so because, while pushing is definitely wrong, flying off the handle is worse, unless he doesn't understand that the phrase means overreacting negatively."]}
