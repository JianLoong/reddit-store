Tossing an entire wedding gown and demanding a brand new one because of a tiny stain seems like a stretch (and privileged AF).

With this truly being an accident on the daughters part. \n\nSecond you left it out in one of those three places in full access. If you had just picked it up and they showed up before you put it away it would still be in garment bag.

Tell your brother and niece that you are sorry (yes, I'm saying you need to apologize) for having such a strong reaction. Understand that your niece may be really heart-broken that she spoiled your dress and that you are so mad at her.\n2. Tell them you love and value them more than the dress.\n3.
