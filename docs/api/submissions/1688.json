At the time, she was living rent-free in her mother\u2019s house and starting a career change. 2 months ago, she moved in with me and is now living rent-free in my house and in graduate school. She has only had a full-time job for 5 months total since I\u2019ve known her. Needless to say, she has no money in the bank and very little income on the horizon. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t want to work - she has applied to hundreds of writing jobs but doesn\u2019t have much experience required to land a job. She did just start an internship that pays $300/month for the next 3 months.  I make pretty good money and got a new & higher paying job 6 months ago so I could better financially support both of us. \n\nHer brother (33) wants to plan a 10-14 day, all-expenses-paid overseas trip for their mother\u2019s 70th birthday in May. My fianc\u00e9 has zero money to contribute to said trip. Assuming I went too, it is also assumed that I would be expected to cover all costs for myself, my fianc\u00e9, and half of her mother\u2019s. I don\u2019t want to do it, and my fianc\u00e9 has no plan for coming up with money to fund the trip herself. So the trip probably won\u2019t happen.\n\nIt\u2019s not that i don\u2019t have the money, there are just other things I want to spend my money on next year. I want to go backpacking in Hawaii for my close friend\u2019s birthday in April, I want to do a $55k home renovation project, and my own mother turns 70 next year too, and I\u2019d like the option to do something for her (maybe she wants her own birthday trip). \n\nIf I don\u2019t fund 50% of the trip, I doubt the trip will happen. It\u2019s not that i don\u2019t have the money, i just don\u2019t want to spend my hard earned money on my future mother-in-law\u2019s birthday trip.

I\u2019m assuming your fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother has an idea that his sister is not working full time and isn\u2019t flush with cash. They\u2019ve put you in a horrible situation. If he wants to take his mom on this trip then good for him do it. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to come up with a gift that she can afford and you can gift her something or not. She\u2019s not your mom and you\u2019ve known her for two years you owe her nothing.", "NTA. That\u2019s a big, big ask. And ridiculous that the brother thinks that would be okay.", ">It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t want to work - she has applied to hundreds of writing jobs but doesn\u2019t have much experience required to land a job.\n\nThere are lots of fun jobs I would like to do, but I would not be able to pay my bills. Therefore, I call these things my hobbies and work at a job that pays me the money I need. \n\nI hope this internship gives your fianc\u00e9 enough of a portfolio to get her foot in the door and get a paying job. I think it is great that you have the ability to fund her while she works towards her dream career. However, she chose to work towards her goal rather than taking anything that pays the bills. That choice has consequences including not having extra money for luxuries right now.", "**NTA** for not wanting to pay for a trip that you weren\u2019t even consulted on. \n\nHowever, as others here have pointed out, by marrying your fianc\u00e9 you become a single income household and what\u2019s yours is now \u201cours\u201d. \n\nIf your GF is used to getting a free ride and has never held a job at 37 years of age, you should have a conversation *before* you get married on how decisions about finances will get made, so she and her brother don\u2019t make more irresponsible decisions that you have to pay for.", "NTA.  Absolutely not your responsibility and I hope your partner gets that. She should remind her brother she doesn\u2019t make much money and is a student and you already pay her basic living expenses. A gift like that simply isn\u2019t in her budget and he needs to give her his own gift separately.", "NTA  \nSorry but if your gf wants to go on this trip, she need to find a job, that pays. \n\nAnd you need to have a serious talk about finances before you get married. This is just the beginning of you funding everything.", "There are lots of non-writing jobs she can apply for to have income until her studies are done. You are NTA if you refuse to pay for over half the trip. \u201cSorry, my mom\u2019s 70th birthday is coming up plus needed home renovations, so my money is budgeted for those things.\u201d\n\nPS - She lived rent-free with her mom and still has no money. I assume she was working full-time prior to her \u201ccareer change\u201d? Take this as a sign, OP. I\u2019d bet money that she\u2019ll be in graduate school for quite a few years to come.", "NTA! Her brother wants to give the trip. He can fund it. This is not your responsibility.", "NTA. To put this to rest, ask your future BIL how he plans to pay for the trip and let him know you won't be contributing to it.\n\nMake sure you let your fiancee know the same.", "NTA \nABORT \u2026ABORT \u2026 ABORT\nSuch a trip is a succession of small decisions and this is not starting well. Even if BIL was offering to pay for MIL. RUN!", "NTA. While it would be nice to go on an aep trip to Europe, that\u2019s something you save up for or win on a game show. You don\u2019t just pop up and say to your future bil that 6 months from now you\u2019re going to have to pay an unknown amount of money for not only yourself and your fianc\u00e9e, but half for your future mil. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair of them to ask you to do that and I wouldn\u2019t. I cringe at the thought of what you\u2019d be out. It would be cheaper for everyone to put together a package for a cruise for just her. Even then that\u2019s expensive. Guess I\u2019m cheap. Lol. My mom would never have wanted that. She didn\u2019t even want birthday and Christmas gifts because she didn\u2019t want us spending our money on her. We did it anyway. \n\nI hope you and your fianc\u00e9 have a wonderful life together.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a lot of money to put out. And it's looking like you gave expensive things coming up sooner than later. Your fianc\u00e9 should understand and shouldn't expect you to put out money like that for her. It sucks for your future MIL, but that's life. It's unfair. I know that sounds callus, but it's the truth.", "NTA and its unrealistic to think you would pay for her mother. It seems like you\u2019re paying enough already, when you\u2019re gf gets a job and starts contributing to the household she can save up to send her mom on a trip", "NTA, but possibly the ATM?", "NTA but you realise that writing is hard enough an area to get into, without trying to break into in at 35 years old, right? There's a very good chance you're going to be the sole income earner for the indefinite future.", "NTA", "NTA. All your plans sound wonderful. Do those! About FMILs 70th, it sounds like sadly it won\u2019t happen as it\u2019s currently planned. You shouldn\u2019t pony up for so much. Lovely idea, FBIL but nope. Maybe a less ambitious plan?", "NTA and you should bring it up soonest. The longer you wait, the worse it might be. Now, me, I think the first time someone had brought that up, I would have said something like 'that's a great thing for you two to give to your mom for her birthday!!' I have a feeling they (or your fiancee) thinks that you're on board with this plan.", "NTA. Maybe he should wait and plan that when it\u2019s more feasible for them to cover it. Planning a trip they can\u2019t afford doesn\u2019t make much sense.", "NTA- you are not an ATM and your fianc\u00e9s family needs to plan something they can afford\u2026", "NTA, that's a lot of money to be spending on something you don't want to do.", "From your fiance's background, it sounds like you are effectively a single income household and will be one for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis shouldn't be a one-off conversation about paying for a 10-14 day cruise for a future MIL.\n\nThis NEEDS to be a longer conversation about how your joint finances will be treated now and after marriage. \n\nYou have the money for some great trips. Because you earned the money, do you get to choose how it's spent and where to go? Or is this family money and you both discuss it and decide together.\n\nYou aren't married yet but you are living together and you really need to talk about this in depth before you officially join your lives together forever. \n\nFinancially supporting a partner can obviously happen in a marriage but it requires some serious discussion and transparency. \n\nNTA \n\nAlso, you didn't ask but 2 weeks?  Can't you suggest a shorter trip? Or simply think about what you and your fiance would like to do for her mom's birthday and how much you are willing to contribute.", "NTA. Am stuck on the fact that She\u2019s how old and never had a job. How you haven\u2019t seen the \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9before this is beyond me, never mind the birthday present.", "NAH\n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9e have set up effectively a single income household, and often in those situations the healthiest thing is to treat that single income as the income of both people. \n\nIf you don't think this is something your household should pay for, talk to your fianc\u00e9e about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
