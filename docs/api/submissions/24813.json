{"id": 24813, "submission_id": "15t3ol1", "title": "AITA for dismissing my rude teen daughter\u2019s feelings?", "selftext": "(Read the edit below. Thank you for the comments, everyone.)\n\nHi, am I out of line? I\u2019m F45, and my daughter is 18.\n\nRecently, my terminally ill aunt died a week after summer break started. (After a few months of her quick deterioration and just a few days of being in hospice because she had no response to treatment.)\n\nMy daughter has always been a closed off, reserved person. However, she\u2019s a little immature when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants, and is very snide and in your face sometimes during those occasions.\n\nWhen my aunt died, my sister came over and has been here ever since, for about four weeks now, when we arranged the funeral and reception. My daughter did not cry or look upset at all, even though she\u2019d sometimes go to look after her greataunt on the days her greatuncle needed to go out, since she was bedbound and completely paralysed and unable to speak. You\u2019d expect some sort of reaction, right? But she had none. She\u2019d avoid her greataunt a lot, and never talked to me about her. \n\nFor this reason, I assumed she was just detached as a lot of children usually are, and left her alone. However, since her aunt and her three young children came to stay, she has been very bratty, and complains when she has to clean up after them because they\u2019re quite spoiled. She\u2019s like this everytime they come to stay, because my sister is quite an unhygienic person and she and her children have had lice for years. She didn\u2019t say anything to them since my aunt is grieving, so she hides in her room for the whole day because she feels \u201cstuffy\u201d and \u201crepulsed.\u201d Always asking me when they will leave. I understand why she feels this way, I don\u2019t like how the children and my sister crowd my home and not clean up after themselves. But they\u2019re family, and we\u2019re grieving even if she\u2019s not.\n\nShe even hated the reception, not serving the guests (family and family friends.) and looking annoyed when I told her to, as she said she just wanted to \u201csit there.\u201d It was very embarrassing for me. All she needed to do was hand out water.\n\nI told her not to be too mean, as they\u2019re family and her aunt is grieving, but she, being immature, narrowed her eyes at me and told me she feels trapped in this house, wanting space, before she went back to her room, even when I ask her to come downstairs and spend time with me.\n\nShe\u2019s usually a sweet girl. Very smart and mature, even emotionally, and very perceptive, but for the past few weeks she\u2019s been more reclusive and bratty than usual, even more so than other times when her aunt has been around. Am I right in being dismissive of her attitude and \u201cfeelings\u201d? It seems to me, as of recently, there\u2019s been a bad change in her. Even if she doesn\u2019t care about her greataunt dying, someone who has taken care of her before developing this illness and who she has known since she was young, she should at least think of her aunt\u2019s needs.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m quite annoyed. My mother told me I should just leave her alone to herself, but she needs to be kinder.\n\nEDIT !!!!!!\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you for all the comments you\u2019ve left, they have really opened my eyes to a lot of the stuff I had a responsibility to notice, but did not. I admit that tradition has influenced a lot of my decisions and my own personality and that has in turn affected my daughter, as much as I ignored it. \n\nI will be having a long discussion with my sister about her problems, trying to sort her hygiene out as well as making her go back home, and giving my daughter a much needed apology. I don\u2019t want to lose her, as many of you had pointed out that the longer I continue on this route, the higher the likelihood she\u2019ll cut me off. I\u2019ll talk to her, and I\u2019ll try to help her however she needs me to help. \n\nUnfortunately, I am not in America but I have called the social services on my sister before and they closed the case after a very short investigation. I will not be calling them again due to their terrible service, but I will force my sister to get her act together by completely barring her from my house until she takes my advice. Only until she has begun to take care of her own kids, will I allow her near my own.\n\nI will also be trying my best to earn my child\u2019s forgiveness. \n\nOnce again, thank you for calling me out on my behaviour. I need to change for my daughter. This has gone on far too long, and it isn\u2019t fair on her.", "created_utc": 1692223474, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15t3ol1/aita_for_dismissing_my_rude_teen_daughters/", "score": 2306, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's kind of obtuse\n\n Let's not even address the fact that she's probably also paranoid she'll get head lice", "YTA. \n\nYour expectations of your daughter are that one, she would be a caregiver for a dying woman. Two, that she will now act as a maid and nanny for your sister's unhygienic and spoiled children. Three, that would would serve guests at a funeral reception she was not hosting. Four, That she would emote on command or at least in a way that suits you. \n\nYour sister has needs all right. The need to move out of your house and take her kids with her. Why has she been there for a month and why haven't you set some boundaries for the well-being of your teenager?", "YTA. I'm sorry for your loss. BUT Even through just what you've written I can tell that your aunt's passing HAS affected your daughter. Just because she doesn't grieve in the way you expect her to doesn't mean she's cold or uncaring.\n\nAnd why should she be expected to clean up after your sister's lice-ridden messy family (I'm not trying to be insulting, just descriptive)? Can't you speak to your sister about managing her children better? Why do you expect your 18yo daughter to be more of a responsible adult than your sister who is the mother of the children??\n\nI don't think it's your daughter who needs to be kinder.\n\nEDIT: and btw, saying she felt \"stuffy\" out in the house sounds like a possible physiological reaction to your sister's family's lack of hygiene. In other words, it can be physical too, not just an emotional reaction.", "YTA - It isn\u2019t your daughter\u2019s job to be an unpaid maid to a family so unhygienic they carry lice. That is absolutely repulsive and places your entire household at risk\u2014and obviously it isn\u2019t just their \u201cgrief\u201d if this is how they live. I wouldn\u2019t want to be around that level of mental illness or neglect either \u2014 why don\u2019t you try cleaning up after them and get lice and see how you like it?\n\nAnd also: who \u201clikes\u201d a funeral reception? What kind of demented better homes and gardens party planet are you living on? Stop alienating your daughter for no reason because \u201cfamily\u201d is no excuse for what you describe.

Majorly.\n\nGrief isn't performative. Just because you haven't seen her cry doesn't mean she isn't bothered. \n\n>for the past few weeks she\u2019s been more reclusive and bratty than usual,\n\nGee... I wonder if something happened recently that would make her withdrawn and less likely to want to deal with people.\n\n\nA better question is why you keep allowing your sister, who is \"quite an unhygienic person and she and her children have had lice for years\" to repeatedly stay in your home, and why are you putting their needs above your daughter's?", "> However, since her aunt and her three young children came to stay, she has been very bratty, and complains when she has to clean up after them because they\u2019re quite spoiled. \n\nDid your daughter invite your sister and her three kids to stay with you? If not, she shouldn\u2019t have to clean up after them. You shouldn\u2019t even be letting them into the house if they\u2019ve got lice. \n\nGo grieve with your sister in her home. \n\nYTA.", "YTA for dimissing your teen daughters feelings yes. She's usually  a sweet girl, but currently you think she isn't, therefore you dismiss her feelings? From what you've written she genuinely doesn't sound that bad at all and has tried to give herself some space.", "Omg yta. I simply can not understand how u can type that out, read it back to urself and not think ur the asshole.", "YTA - are you sure her shift in behavior isn't due to her great aunt dying? Maybe that's the way she's coping with it. \n\nYour houseguests are not her responsibility. And since their behavior is not a result of their grieving, but rather just part of their personality, she definitely shouldn't have to put up with it and quite frankly, neither should you. If you invite people into your home, regardless of the circumstance, they should be gracious guests, and at the very least be cleaning up after themselves.\n\nIt sounds as if you regularly expect her to help out with things that aren't her responsibility. I get that we all want kids that are compassionate and caring and helpful but have you met teenagers? That's your prerogative as a parent but it's also her prerogative as a teenager to have a bad attitude about it.", "Edit to add judgment - YTA.  \n\nHairstylist here. Lice is NOT a joke! It IS a big deal, your sisters children having lice FOR YEARS is a giant red flag and a sign of outright neglect of their hygiene to the point that someone should be calling cps(if they go to in person school I\u2019m literally in shock that a teacher or nurse hasn\u2019t done this yet).  HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS, and if they\u2019ve been in your house for literally weeks it\u2019s almost inevitable that you and your family will contract it as well. You\u2019ll have to literally boil all your clothes/bedding that have been anywhere near them for any length of time and have your furniture professionally disinfected to have any chance of not getting it. Your daughter closing herself off in her room is actually giving her a better chance and I don\u2019t blame her for feeling disgusting being forced into proximity with people who are literally carrying parasites.", "So a fake one, again? Or YTA and you are so hopelessly dumb it's not even worth mentioning.", "Geez. Some people really shouldn't have kids.", "INFO: Does your daugther plan to move out soon? Are supporting her with getting out of the nest?", "YTA. Please do something quickly before we\u2019d see you in five or six years asking why your daughter went NC with you. \n\nGrieving is NOT a public performance. It is an intimate process and more often than not, people who don\u2019t show it on the outside are in extreme pain on the inside. NO ONE shoud expect this poor girl to cry as a public display to prove that she is suffering. She manages the best she can as a young adult and this entire process is insanely hard as it is without having her mother pestering her for not showing enough emotions. This only makes you the AH. \n\nBut the part about her having to clean up other people\u2019s disgusting messes and expecting her to be the perfect little hostess at the funeral makes you a colossal AH. This is just wrong. If she is shy and reserved why on earth would you force her to act as a waitress ? You\u2019re putting her on the back burner, making just about everyone\u2019s feelings more important than hers. \n\nDo better now before she puts YOU on her back burner.", "Gently, YTA. It's not totally clear why your sister and her kids need to be there right now, but you've essentially allowed this chaotic environment in your home during a time of grief. Your daughter's attitude is her trying to communicate that she's unhappy with this but doesn't have the vocabulary or maturity to do so. You are not right in being dismissive towards this, you have to demonstrate emotional maturity and talk with her, preferably when your sister and her chaos aren't around so your daughter can safely express what her needs are. \n\nIs this the first major death in the family? I wouldn't write off her reaction as not caring, but just processing differently than you do.", "YTA for allowing dirty, lice ridden people into your home and around other relatives and expecting your daughter to clean up after them! I\u2019d be horrified if I went to a funeral found out people there had years long lice issues. Yuck.", "This whole distancing herself and not being social? That is mourning, and I'm willing to bet that part of the reason she isn't doing what you think she should (crying and that) is because your behaviour has made it clear that her feelings don't matter and that she can't show her feelings (because she has to take care of her aunt's kids/aunt and clean up after them, and serve people drinks, and generally do whatever you don't feel like doing)\n\nYou've basically decided she needs to take on the role of carer for these kids, and it seems like you think she should have spent the funeral reception serving people instead of being able to have feelings and process them.\n\nIt seems like you're punishing her for not mourning the way you think she should, and making it difficult for her to get even a second to herself to feel without having to deal with other people and their expectations.\n\nYTA, give your daughter a break, and tell your sister that she needs to get her kid's lice treated and clean up after them if she wants to stay in your home. It's not your daughter's job to follow after them like a maid, or to get lice because you can't say no or enforce boundaries with your sister.", "Disgustingly YTA", "Sorry you entirely lost me when you said your sister and her children have had lice for YEARS. That\u2019s inexcusable on your sister\u2019s part. My siblings and I all dealt with a horrendous bout of lice in our youth and that\u2019s not just something to brush past. If your sister and her children have been lice infested for so long, they need serious help. And you should NOT be allowing them into your home with your daughter. Lice is so contagious and you\u2019re literally putting your daughter in harm\u2019s way. YTA and so is your sister who apparently has been letting her children be fuckin eaten alive by LICE.", "1. Your daughter was forced to care for her great aunt when great uncle was out. Why didn\u2019t great aunt have a carer? \n\n2. Now, your daughter is forced to clean up after her three cousins who are spoiled. Why don\u2019t they have to clean up after themselves? \n\n3. You mention your daughter was forced to serve guests at the reception. Why wasn\u2019t she allowed peace to grieve like everyone else? \n\n4. You bash your daughter for being detached, immature, and a slew of other negative adjectives. At no point do you mention actually asking her how she feels and it\u2019s clear you force her to pick up everyone else\u2019s slack and take on responsibilities that aren\u2019t hers. Of course she isn\u2019t happy and wants to be alone. \n\n5. You finally say a few nice things about her being sweet, then turn around call her bratty and say she\u2019s had a bad change recently.

I\u2019m F45, and my daughter is 18.\n\nRecently, my terminally ill aunt died a week after summer break started. (After a few months of her quick deterioration and just a few days of being in hospice because she had no response to treatment.)\n\nMy daughter has always been a closed off, reserved person. However, she\u2019s a little immature when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants, and is very snide and in your face sometimes during those occasions.\n\nWhen my aunt died, my sister came over and has been here ever since, for about four weeks now, when we arranged the funeral and reception. My daughter did not cry or look upset at all, even though she\u2019d sometimes go to look after her greataunt on the days her greatuncle needed to go out, since she was bedbound and completely paralysed and unable to speak. You\u2019d expect some sort of reaction, right? But she had none. She\u2019d avoid her greataunt a lot, and never talked to me about her. \n\nFor this reason, I assumed she was just detached as a lot of children usually are, and left her alone. However, since her aunt and her three young children came to stay, she has been very bratty, and complains when she has to clean up after them because they\u2019re quite spoiled. She\u2019s like this everytime they come to stay, because my sister is quite an unhygienic person and she and her children have had lice for years. She didn\u2019t say anything to them since my aunt is grieving, so she hides in her room for the whole day because she feels \u201cstuffy\u201d and \u201crepulsed.\u201d Always asking me when they will leave. I understand why she feels this way, I don\u2019t like how the children and my aunt crowd my home and not clean up after themselves. But they\u2019re family, and we\u2019re grieving even if she\u2019s not.\n\nShe even hated the reception, not serving the guests (family and family friends.) and looking annoyed when I told her to, as she said she just wanted to \u201csit there.\u201d It was very embarrassing for me. All she needed to do was hand out water.\n\nI told her not to be too mean, as they\u2019re family and her aunt is grieving, but she, being immature, narrowed her eyes at me and told me she feels trapped in this house, wanting space, before she went back to her room, even when I ask her to come downstairs and spend time with me.\n\nShe\u2019s usually a sweet girl. Very smart and mature, even emotionally, and very perceptive, but for the past few weeks she\u2019s been more reclusive and bratty than usual, even more so than other times when her aunt has been around. Am I right in being dismissive of her attitude and \u201cfeelings\u201d? It seems to me, as of recently, there\u2019s been a bad change in her. Even if she doesn\u2019t care about her greataunt dying, someone who has taken care of her before developing this illness and who she has known since she was young, she should at least think of her aunt\u2019s needs.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m quite annoyed. My mother told me I should just leave her alone to herself, but she needs to be kinder.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's where I spent that summer (it was where we'd always spent the summer).  It was okay; I didn't miss the old house, but the beach house had always felt temporary.  And since I'd started college, I never truly \"moved in\" and made it my real home. I didn't have my own space there.  Although I guess I'd say that didn't bother me so much.\n\nAnyway the reason I'm setting this up is to say that right when the summer was starting, an old family friend lost the apartment she and her husband had been renting for like... easily 20 years.   Her husband was away a lot, traveling for work, and their kids were all grown. She needed someplace to stay temporarily, while looking for a new place to live.  Her daughter, who lived nearby, was a realtor, so that shouldn't have taken long. (To this day, I don't know why she didn't go stay with the daughter, but I have my suspicions.)\n\nShe stayed for 3/4 of the entire freaking summer.  The house was tiny, with two bedrooms. (It was one of those little shotgun type shacks; a modern trailer home would be bigger.)  She got one of the bedrooms. I spent the summer sleeping on the fold-out couch in the living room.  We expected her to be there a couple of weeks, a month at the outside.  But she just stayed, and stayed.  And my mom and I were just too taken aback with this to muster up the willpower to tell her to GET OUT. (Finally, my mom did.)\n\nI think she had thought, oh, they just lost their husband/father, they'll be happy to have me stay there and offer them company and emotional support! (And of course, living rent-free, and having company, which she wouldn't have at home, since as I said, her husband was never home, and her kids were all grown. And she wasn't even working.)\n\nI don't know, maybe SHE would have wanted that, if she'd been in that situation of just losing her husband.  But that wasn't the way me or my mom operated.  We'd lost my dad after a grueling illness, we'd had to upend our lives and move my mom to another state (thankfully into someplace familiar).  And then, we got no chance to just... be with each other.  Connect with each other, or work out the grief we were both feeling. Because we had this person -- a friend!  yes, someone we liked! but! -- who was Always There. It wasn't a big place, you couldn't get away from anyone.  I had almost no privacy for the whole time (had to clear up the bed and make the room ready to be a living room during the day, etc.)\n\nSo when I say I feel a huge amount of sympathy with this poor girl, who in one way or the other is trying to navigate what are likely complex feelings about her great-aunt's death, and who isn't allowed to feel peaceful or secure in her own home because her mother invited a bunch of nightmare relatives to stay there for a month \\*on purpose\\*... oh my GOD.", "Free room and board for a month? They should be cleaning up for you.", "You're right, *getting* lice usually isn't due to poor hygiene. Especially when it comes too children, they often get it in school or such.\n\nBut *having lice for years* is definitely due to poor hygiene/neglectful parents. They're annoying, but not that hard to get rid off.", "Do you understand that your sister is abusing her kids? She is neglecting them and you just seem to think thats fine.", "This. Our dog unwittingly brought home lice once. That was a nightmare, to get everything clean. But normal washing machine sufficed and we had to spray something and vacuum everything. Took us two days but we got rid of them. Luckily there was a pill that made dogs blood fatal for them and we could avoid getting them ourselves.", "I'm sorry, you're not **allowing** her?\n\nThis is more than being an asshole, you're flat out abusive.", "Same I am scratching my scalp and I don\u2019t have lice \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b", "Ugh. Tell me about it. I had lice once and I was the younger sibling unfortunately. It was when I was 3... I still have vivid memories of the experience, even though I was only THREE. Even at that age I had extremely long hair, and I remember my mom sitting with me in the bathroom with that comb for lice with the thin metal prongs and a magnifying glass combing and searching through my hair for what felt like hours. And it itched so badly. No thanks. I can live my life happily without experiencing that again. Thank goodness my mother was both a nurse and clean freak, so she kept the lice fairly contained. But still. Gross. \n\nYTA, OP. Majorly. Your daughter's 'bad attitude' is probably \\*because\\* she's grieving, and you just don't realize it. Oh, and I don't know. Probably also has to do with the fact that you're also expecting her to be a servant for her nasty, lice infested family on top of a period of loss.", "Minor point but it's \"infest\" not \"infect\". Infestation is by macroorganisms and infection is by microorganisms.", "My son had gorgeous curls that had to be cut off so we could run the comb through and get the nits. He was so ashamed of his appearance until his hair grew back. I wouldn\u2019t wish lice on my worst enemy.", "My grandmother died and I didn't cry until a month later. Nobody thought I wasn't grieving.", "I keep it all inside until I don't. I internalize things. It's not wrong. It's just not as demonstrative as some people expect.", "I'm so sorry, what a horrible situation. I'm glad your parents have acknowledged and addressed their role in adding to your pain in such a tough time", "You do not need to boil your clothes to kill the lice. Nits won't be hatching on clothes and the live bugs die in the hot water and dryer. They come back if you miss one nit or bug in the hair", "Southeast; and I think this situation would be mortifying for most of my family. Funerals can be long but imposing on the family's house is despicable, ESPECIALLY adding on extra cleaning and serving. I'd be absolutely mortified if my niece had to wait on me at a funeral.", "\u201cBeing family\u201d is a great excuse many family members use to be abusive to them. You unfortunately can\u2019t pick your family, and this poor girl is getting the short end of the stick in this one. \n\n\nAnd yes knowingly bringing your filth ridden sister and her filth ridden kids to your house to infect your own child with lice all while excusing her feelings about her great aunt passing is abuse.", "So you\u2019re choosing your sister over your daughter, and then complaining your daughter isn\u2019t warm and welcoming with you and your family.", "That\u2019s super cool to know!", "That makes it worse. Curly hair is already a handful!", "Then why don't you treat THE ONES WHO HAS LICE??\nGROSS. Make them do treatments!", "Lice are NOT easy to get rid of. You are a neglectful abusive parent for subjecting your daughter to this.", "Ew", "Wow. What exactly has your sister done to earn your daughter's respect, hmm? Respect is earned, not demanded. Your sister is a serious piece of work - YOU need to earn your daughter's respect by kicking your sister out until she cleans up her act (and her kids' heads). Good lord. Your poor kid.", "Yup. My sisters are kind of useless in hard situations. None of us really understand how they got that useless. Even though my dad is an asshole, he's calm, cool and collected in hard situations. So's our mom, even more so.\n\nAll I know is that during hard situations, I'm the one that needs to hold it together because they won't. So I make sure they're okay and eventually feel my emotions.", "I suppose you're right. It definitely is emotional abuse, and ig i tried to justify it the way my mom did with me, by \"helping\" the family. \n\ni always tell my bf when we have kids, i won't ever make our children take care of each other in more than a sibling role. i won't parentify them the way my parents did with me. \n\nop does seem to be ignorant to the way their daughter feels about them and calls them a \"moody teen\". but mother and daughters are always deemed as \"lashing out with each other\". i've only ever heard jokes of mothers and daughters are each other worst enemies. and then i see sad poems about it. so obviously this happens to people and i think op is doing the same. \n\ngood on you for recognizing abuse so easy, you seem to be a very emotionally healthy person."]}
