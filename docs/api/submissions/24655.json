I will never have cameras in my house because of this and when I house sit for friends who have cameras  I politely ask that they unplug them while I stay there and they have no issue you with it because they know my background with cameras. Hopefully you and your mom can compromise.", "NAH. She is well in her rights to have them,and you are well in your rights to not visit.", "NAH.

It's creepy and I cannot understand people's obsession of monitoring everything.", "NAH. She wants cameras; you don't want cameras.\n\nShe doesn't want to talk about it. That's fine.\n\nYou have incompatible needs. Don't complain; just don't visit.\n\nShe has no valid complaint. She made her choice, and you made yours.", "NTA.

I mean, I'll admit that I think it's weird to have security cameras in your home just running all the time, but it's your mother's choice. That said, I agree with you and wouldn't want to stay in a private house where I'm being monitored all the time. That's really creepy to be able to spy on your guests constantly.", "NTA. But it's her house.\n\nVisit but get a hotel if you're so worried about it.", "INFO\n\nIs there any reason why your mother or brother might distrust you or your husband?  This is very strange.\n\nYes, one is frequently on cameras in public.  But the interior of a person's private home is not a public place!\n\nThere are plenty of things one might do, at home, that one wouldn't do in a public place.  E.g., if you were cooking breakfast or lunch in the kitchen, when your mother was out, and spilled something hot on your shirt, you might pull the shirt off, to avoid getting burned, toss it in the laundry room, then go, without a shirt, to your room to get a clean shirt. What if you're walking from the shower to the bedroom, to get dressed, just with a towel?  Is the hallway visible on the camera?\n\nA living room is not as private as a bedroom or bathroom.  But there is a much greater expectation of privacy than if you're out in public!\n\nIf possible, make your excuses and stay elsewhere.  You can just say you don't want to have to worry night and day about whether or not you're on camera.  \n\nNot visiting at all for the holidays may be overkill, if there is a reasonable alternative with suitable privacy for you to stay at, and only visit during the celebrations. (Hotel, stay with a different family member, etc.)\n\nBut do take your time to think about things.  If your family doesn't trust your spouse, there is a (slight) chance that they have valid reasons, and you're too close to see them.  A lot depends on the larger relationship history with your family.", "NAH. I get it. I'm uncomfortable with cameras inside a home, but this isn't your home. Stay in a hotel and meet elsewhere for dinner?", "NAH-She has a right to put cameras in her home just as you have the right to not visit because of the cameras.", "Your mother is well within her rights to have cameras to her heart's content. \n\nYou are also within your rights to not want to visit her home because you aren't happy with this.\n\nThis would be N-A-H but your mother's reaction of telling you to \"stop it\" and to \"stop bringing it up\" make her an AH. No reasonable person speaks to another adult like that in a normal conversation. Does she often treat you like a child? NTA.", "Unless there's ones directly in the bathroom, shower or in bedrooms I don't personally see what the big deal is. \n\nYou realize that almost anywhere public you go these days there's a good chance of being recorded right? Stop lights, retail stores, door bells, you can't even escape it. \n\nNAH, if that's an issue for you, fine, but you aren't entitled to having them taken down.", "NAH. You're within your rights to not want to be filmed in the common areas of your mom's house and she's well without her rights to have them in common areas.\n\nI was going to vote NTA until I read that she only had cameras in the living room, kitchen, hallways, and yards. That's very reasonable areas to have them, and where we plan on installing them in our own house. It would have been a NTA from me if she installed them in the room and bathroom you planned on using, however, since that's creepy. I already have them monitoring the great room where we live now, and nobody that has stayed with us or house sit for us has indicated it's an issue. We don't actually use them that often, we have them to check on our dogs and monitor for intruders, as they're all pointed at exterior doors.\n\nA possible compromise, if you're comfortable, is asking her to turn off all the ones but the ones that are outside. That way, she can monitor her property and know who is there and who leaves, but she can't see what you're doing inside the house.", "Maybe she's paranoid. Hall and kitchen aren't a big deal. Now if there were cameras in bedrooms or bathrooms, that's a red flag.\n\nBut the same way she's paranoid about her house, you have the right to be uncomfortable about being filmed and not visit.\n\nDon't bother waiting to talk to her, she's probably going to pressure you with all the things she's planned for your visit.\n\nTell her clearly now. No cameras, or no visit.", "NTA for not wanting to be filmed but YTA for trying to make your mom feel bad about it. Just keep your opinions to yourself and tell her you're not comfortable potentially being seen doing something embarrassing. This is her home, her cameras, and you know ahead of time and can refrain from illegal or embarrassing activities while you're there. This sounds like just an excuse not to see your mom, which is fine, but she's not wrong for wanting the cameras. I have 2 cameras inside my home and they have provided valuable medical and legal information over the years.", "NAH in my book. Your mother is well-within her right to have cameras installed in the common areas of her home like the living room and kitchen, but it's totally understandable that you would want her to feel comfortable enough with you to not be filmed during what's supposed to be a relaxing holiday time together. I hope you two can come to an agreement, but I don't think either of you is wrong for wanting a sense of privacy or security. If she only had cameras on the outside and, say, at the doorways inside, I'd say you were being unreasonable. If she had cameras in the bedrooms or bathrooms, I'd say she is being unreasonable. Where it stands right now, it feels like a decent gray area. Maybe you can talk to her about turning off the cameras in just the living room as a compromise, since that is a room you are likely to spend a lot of idle time in.", "NTA\n\nI'm going to level with you, I was fully prepared to call you the asshole here because security cameras don't exist to spy on people you are hosting, and any spying she would do while you are already in her home is sorta mitigated by the fact she will be right there in the room with you and would be watching anyway. \n\nBUT THEN she said:\n\n> it's her home and she wants to know what goes on in it\n\nWhich is a ***super strange*** way to frame \"they are security cameras.\" She should know what is happening in her home anyway. She's hosting you.\n\nIt's pretty sus, and I'd question if those bedrooms don't also have cameras.", "NTA. This obsession with monitoring what your family members/partners/friends/kids are doing is fucking creepy. External cameras for security or doorbell cams, fine. Actually having apps to alert you of movement inside your home when you have family or guests there? Unhinged. I'm so sick of reading posts and comments justifying location tracking and camera monitoring. It's weird behaviour to care so deeply about precisely what someone else is doing and spy on them.", "If the cameras were in your guest room, I'd say you're being reasonable.  But the cameras are in the common areas, so it doesn't feel creepy to me.  Think of it like staying in a hotel, you're probably going to be on camera everywhere except your room, and you accept that reality.  What's the difference?  \n\n\nI think YTA here.  The cameras make your mom feel safe, and they aren't invading any of your private spaces (bedroom/bathroom).  Calling off a family holiday that is clearly so important seems a bit extreme because you don't want to be filmed in common areas.", "NAH We have a camera in our living room as well as several outside. The living room camera is disabled in \"home\" mode and on in \"away\" mode. Ask you mother how theirs is set up. If you don't like the answer stay at a hotel. It would make me uncomfortable to have cameras on me when I'm visiting family so I understand your concerns.", "Why not just stay in a hotel?", "NTA. And I find it interesting that people are assuming there are no cameras in the bedrooms and bathrooms. Despite your mother just mentioning the public rooms, I would be suspicious.", "NTA...honestly,  if it were me, I'd be groping and kissing all over her house...", "NAH. Her home, she can do what she wants. You\u2019re an adult, so what you want.", "NTA. Security cameras outside the house makes sense. Cameras inside that mean she can watch your every move\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t want to go there either!", "NTA. Indoor surveillance is unnecessary, especially when the home is occupied.

I don't blame you for not wanting to stay in the home when you're going to be surveilled every second.", "INFO: Is she watching while you are in the rooms? Or is it for burgalars.\n\nEdit: Wrong wording", "NTA The indoor security cameras are unnecessary if the home is occupied. At that point your just spying on your guests. I have no objection to people securing their home but I reserve the right not to set food in their home if I am going to be surveiled.", "NTA and totally fine not to visit if it doesn\u2019t sit right with you. The only camera I would accept INSIDE a home is the one facing the front door or a hallway. All other cameras are totally unnecessary, but hey, it\u2019s not my home and not my rules. I have experienced confronting a burglar whilst he was sitting in my family car, so the trauma is real, but I would never put a camera in any of the rooms unless I was away and left the house empty for a long time.", "I don't understand what the issue is unless these cameras will be in the bathrooms or the room you'll be sleeping in.  \n\nHer house, her rules.

NTA.", "ESH. You have every right to not want to be recorded, but it is also their right to have cameras set up in their home. So many people nowadays have smart devices and apps like Ring make it very easy to have these things set up. It is also true that authorities have free access to this footage and I'm sure there are people out there who try to collect whatever raunchy footage they could.\n\nIf it upsets you that much then the easiest thing is to just not go, there is nothing inherently special about Christmas other than a lot of people get those holidays off so it's easy to take vacations.", "Very soft YTA \n\nHer house, her rules.... And I am one that thinks the live streaming security cameras are invasive to family.

I assume the inside cameras can be turned off during your visit. You can check with her (and your brother) on that. Your concern for privacy is perfectly valid; her desire to be able to see anything that occurs in the common spaces of her house is... weird, but still her right. \n\nYou don't need to stay at the house. You can choose not to visit at all. Get this sorted before you plan anything.", "Just stay in a hotel. Where there will also be cameras BTW. You would be shocked to know how many cameras there are out there.", "NAH. She has every right to have cameras in the public areas of her home. You have the right to be bothered by it.

Unless she has a nefarious history or a history of breaking your trust , I don't think something unfortunate can happen because of you being monitored on camera\n\nIt's her house now and she gets to do whatever she wants. Atleast your childhood didn't have constant monitoring", "NTA.   \nYour mom is allowed to have cameras in her home, and if the people occupying the home are comfortable, then it is fine. \n\nYou have every right to to your feelings of comfort with this and decide not to attend. You are not demanding she removes them or manipulating her, but you do not feel comfortable. That said, she is not weird for having them - they are a source of comfort for many.   \nMaybe you do not stay the whole week or you find a compromise. She disconnects the living room & kitchen camera for your stay, if she is agreeable, but the others remain?\n\nFor the comments about cameras/CCTV in public - that is different.

If my mom installed cameras in the common areas of her home, it wouldn't change my behavior when I visit her.  If she wanted to \"spy\" on me sneaking a midnight snack or watching late-night TV, then I guess she's got a pretty boring life, but whatever tickles her turkey.\n\nAs for listening in on conversations not meant for her to hear, that's valid.

Your mom seeing that you helped yourself to an extra slice of apple pie?", "Yes, I agree that indoor surveillance comes in handy (very much, you can save a lot with it). It's not as necessary when the home is occupied with members (other than burglars lol), like how the mom would be in this home and so would OP, so you'd know someone is breaking in, etc. When it comes to this, OP feeling uncomfortable with cameras watching her is understandable. In my house, we use cameras but only when we're out.\n\nI agree with your point that indoor surveillance is very handy, however (not disagreeing with you, lol)!

Staying in a hotel is a great compromise.", "NAH. Mom's entitled to have cameras; OP's entitled to stay elsewhere. \n\nI don't know why so many people think indoor cameras are weird.

The cameras you described aren\u2019t in the bedrooms or bathrooms and yet you are getting worked up over them? It\u2019s her house not yours. And a lot of security systems have cameras.
