She thinks I\u2019m a \u201cgolden child.\u201d I don\u2019t what she expects me to do about it, now, though.\n\nCurrently, she's a divorced single mom to Nephew (15) living with our parents.  \n\nMy husband and I have a decent combined salary, so even with a 3yo, I can still splurge on Nephew sometimes.\n\nNephew's birthday is in mid January. This year he asked for a combo Xmas/Bday present as per an ongoing deal: can he have the money to pay for an end of year club trip. He wasn\u2019t going to be able to go, b/c he couldn\u2019t fund-raise enough.\n\nI asked Sister if that was something that was alright to do. She said it was fine.\n\nChristmas Day comes. Sister is confused that I only gave him a small Lego set. And I said \"I'm paying for the club trip?\" And she's like \"oh right,\" but then is pissy for the rest of Christmas, and I never figure out what the problem is.\n\nI try to confirm that paying for his trip is still okay in case that\u2019s the issue, and all she says is \"That's fine.\"  \n\nI get that all taken care of by giving my nephew a check to take in.\n\nThen there's a repeat of Christmas at his family birthday.\n\nThis weekend, I'm over at their house when Sister comes in and starts screaming at me about buying Nephew a trip that she doesn\u2019t want him going on. And I'm like \"You said it was okay. Here's the text messages.\" And she says \"Why did you write a check?\" And I'm like \u201cwhy does that matter?\u201d Then she goes into this whole spiel about how I always try to make her look bad. I\u2019m not about to have a fight in front of my kid, so I just leave while she\u2019s still screaming at me.\n\nNext day Nephew asks me if he's still going on his club trip and I say \u201ctalk to your mom.\u201d 10 minutes later, call from Sister screaming me down again for \"making her look bad\" in front of her son because he\u2019s mad at her for barring him from the trip. And I'm like \"Well you\u2019re the one not letting him go on the trip.\" And she says \"You paid for the trip, and gave him the expectation.\" And I'm like \"You literally told me I could.\" Then she says \"Well, I didn't think you'd actually pay for it so it wouldn't be a problem.\" I just say \"When have I not kept a promise like this?\" and hang up because I have to get back to work.\n\nAnd normally I feel like I have it all under control with Sister, but this time Mom calls me telling me I need to be more sensitive and understanding. I said \u201cno, she\u2019s acting like a child.\u201d And I, again, hung up, because I'm not doing this with them and that is literally the only way to not get into some cyclic argument.\n\nNow they're both blowing up my phone, and I'm ignoring them. My aunt is even texting me being like \"I don't know what happened, but talk to your mom\" so they've made this a family thing.  I've tried texting my nephew, but it's not going through, so I think I've been blocked on his phone.\n\nMy husband and I are both bias, so I implore the masses to tell me where/if I screwed up.", "created_utc": 1676527600, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113jly3/aita_for_making_my_sister_look_bad_for_paying_for/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is it just because she feels bad that she can\u2019t afford it? \n\nYou are NTA. You asked her if it was ok more than once, and she agreed. Also, with her comment on the check, maybe she expected you to hand her cash for the trip which she could then spend on something else.", "NTA\n\nYou spoke to the parent first, got their permission beforehand, and had multiple other instances of confirmation.\n\nI dunno what the heck is her problem, but she seems to have a few of \u2018em.  Maybe its related to her home life and being back at mom/dad\u2019s place and feeling ashamed.  But she is taking out her frustration on you and its not fair at all.  Everyone loses, the nephew included", "The part where she said yes for you paying for the trip then being mad you paid for the trip and telling  shouldn't have done so is weird.  She mentioned \"why did you write a check?\"  Was she hoping for cash so she could spend it on something else?  NTA in any case.", "NTA\u2026 she literally told you it was fine to pay for the trip.. her behavior is baffling. If she didn\u2019t want him to go, she absolutely should have just told you \u201cno\u201d and then told him he couldn\u2019t go. I am curious as to why she\u2019s so opposed to him having this experience though- trips and travel can be amazing experiences for kids that age. \n\nRegardless, from how you\u2019ve told it, this is in her, not you.", "NTA. WTF, you don\u2019t tell someone that it\u2019s cool to pay for your kid\u2019s trip and then throw a tantrum when they do it.  You checked 4 times!  Your sister is being utterly ridiculous.", "NTA.  She literally said it was ok.  Multiple times.  She made HERSELF look bad in front of her son and needs to grow the hell up.", "NTA. \n\n\nSister said it was ok more than once. If she can\u2019t say what she means when she gives you an answer she needs to grow the fuck up and that\u2019s not on you. The only asshole here is her. Has she even given you a reason your nephew isn\u2019t allowed to go on the trip? Did he do something wrong?", "NTA 100%. Has your sister always had this type of behavior, or is it something new since her divorce? It sounds like she needs counseling at the very least. I really don't understand your family's response to this.", "NTA\n\n  I think she was expecting you to not pay so that later she could say \"aunt was supposed to gift you that, it's her fault\". But since you did paid, she is doing what she can to make you look bad nevertheless. Block them for a while and focus on your husband and child", "NTA.  You've done nothing wrong, even if it upset someone's apple cart.\n\nBut there's a lot more going on here than we (and clearly you) are privy to, so an update once everything has cleared up would be nice.\n\nOthers have suggested she planned on absconding with the money herself.  That's a possibility, although I suspect it's something more nuanced than that. \n\nI'm guessing she's not working.  If she was living with your parents expense free, she should have plenty of disposable income for extracurriculars such as the trip.  My guess is that this has finally come to a head, your parents have decided to cut her off on extra cash, and she then told your nephew that he can't do anything that involves extra money because she no longer has it.\n\nSo yes, in one respect, you're making her look bad by paying for something that she already said she can't.  A slightly alternative version might be that she planned to pretend that SHE paid for the trip.  When you \"cheaped out\" on the traditional gifts, it make it clear to everyone, especially your nephew, exactly where the funds were coming from.  The check further solidifies that.  It's not loose cash that could have come from anywhere, but clearly came directly from you.\n\nAlso, I'm guessing there's discussion of cars and college going on too, probably with similar arguments.  \n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if any splurging you've done in the past has been manipulated to obscure the actual origin to make it appear that she was more involved in the process.", "NTA. She said he could go and you could pay for it. All she's doing is hurting her relationship with her son. I feel for the kid. I don't know if his dad can intervene or what, but someone needs to talk to her.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you did everything right\n\n* you asked first, she agreed\n* you even briefly discussed it after the fact, sister still agreed \n\nNow she\u2019s like I never wanted that?", "NTA.  She\u2019s refusing to parent her kid.  If she has a good reason for not wanting him to go, she needs to be an adult, stand by it, and understand her teenage son is going to be pissed.  Calling you and yelling at you because her teenager doesn\u2019t like her parenting choices is just all around delusional.  You were very correct that she\u2019s acting like a child and are by far not the asshole.", "NTA at all. Your sister\u2019s insecurities are showing.", "NTA you checked with her repeatedly and every time she said yes.\n\nReally, this sounds like it's not so much about you, but her own anxiety and insecurity bubbling over.  Her life isn't going very smoothly, you're younger and more financially secure, and you're an easy target for her to take her frustrations out on.  It's not fair to you, and I hope you two can talk calmly about it.  She should be grateful for any help you give your nephew.", "NTA in this situation you checked with her several times.  I love how she is confused at small Lego set which is not cheap by the way.   She obviously has some expectations on how much you should spend on them watch that.  \n\nWhen she calls you the golden child does she mean your parent treated her better than you or just that you made different decisions in life.", "Not the asshole.", "NTA, you did everything right and your sister IS behaving like a child.", "NTA undoubtedly.
