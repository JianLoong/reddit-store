I\u2019m a 16 year old girl who\u2019s trained in kung fu since I was 5. For the last year especially I was training for a chance to make the US team. Last spring I went to Texas to compete and made it in for my double sword, a traditional weapon.  \n\nThis year, China is holding the World Championships which I\u2019m eligible to go to because of my US team status. However, my parents and my kung fu coaches seem to want my sister to take part in it too. Of course my judgement could be flawed but I genuinely think kung fu is not her element. She\u2019s a delicate, dainty kid which obviously isn\u2019t the style of kung fu. She complains and becomes upset if she\u2019s dragged to the basement to practice, and much prefers to ice skate. My sister has been to only 2 competitions in her life while I have been to dozens.\n\nDespite this, she, along with my parents and kung fu coaches, want her to participate in the World Championships. My coaches have crucial connections and have said they can easily sneak her name in, and my parents think this would be great to put on a college app. \n\nI was pretty upset learning about this and told my parents I would stop putting effort into kung fu if I could just be \u201cbackended\u201d onto the team. My sister is angry that I\u2019m not supporting her. They don\u2019t seem to understand that competing against other country reps is a pretty big deal and being \u201ca good thing to put on a college app\u201d doesn\u2019t make this whole thing less corrupt. \n\nOf course I understand that her being there would not impact me in the slightest but I\u2019m still pretty livid that she can be on the US team without the same effort.

My teacher says he is a dancer:) Although he is a wrathful master fighter. \nWhat i mean to say is physical strengths is important ofcourse, but skillfully using your strengths and energy is even more important. Combine the two and you are unstoppable.\n\nI hope that you continue practicing kung fu and keep deepening with it.", "she won't last long in the actual competition, in that case, so why worry.  if you quit trying you are gonna hurt yourself and your teammates, so why be like that?  let her fall flat on her face, or not -- but don't drop out because of it, that would not make you TAH, but it would definitely be a stupid and self-destructive act on your part.  let her win or lose, you do you and stay out of it.  it's between her, the coaches, and the parental units.", "Here's the thing.  It appears to be a done deal.  Your coaches are all onboard with this plan.

However, the rules here state a post with ongoing discussion can\u2019t be deleted.", "There is. Typically there\u2019s a designated competition for trying out for the team. There\u2019s a traditional team and regular kung fu team. For the traditional team you need to score above a certain point and for the regular team you need to be the top 3? 5?", "Oh well. Focus on YOU.", "I\u2019m sure I can find a way if that seems the best thing to do.", "The endurance and strength needed of martial arts is very different than that of an ice skater. Also you aren't being hit while performing ice skating.", "Yep I like to describe it to people as a hybrid of dancing and fighting", "So you keep saying the same thing over and over.  We've read that.  You came on here asking for opinions.  Your responses keep being you don't like how she was \"backended\" onto to the team.  OK I've read that a TON of times. I don't know what you want out of this?   I hope you decide not to sabotage yourself, but you seem unable to move off a point.  I wish you luck.", "And the coaches have decided to bypass all of this to add your sister to the team?", "You\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t quit over this. I just feel really unmotivated because of this.", "I want to correct something pretty major. In kung fu you aren\u2019t hit. It\u2019s kind of like a combo of dancing and fighting. Either way, they require very different muscles. Both are difficult and I have mad respect for my sister doing ice skating.", "You probably think ballerinas or dancers are weak too. Trash opinion", "I mean either way, wish her luck and show her up. I assume just randomly deciding to do it doesn't trump dedicated practice anyway.", "I can\u2019t lie I have said that like a dozen times sorry but idk what other point there could be to make? I can\u2019t really move off that point because that\u2019s the only point to make I guess. I\u2019ve gained a new perspective from a lot of the people who commented. If more information is needed I can happily provide though", "No doubt. Anyone that can go and compete in anything has mad skills.", "I never said they were weak. I said it's different. Just because someone is good at one sport doesn't translate to other sports. I will always point out that a contact sport is more demanding physically than a non-contact sport.", "For sure. I\u2019m not really concerned in it affecting me directly, I\u2019m just miffed she makes it to one of my biggest dreams since I was 5 with half the care.", "Nope. As guttering as it they will either do it or they won't.\n\nAll you can do is wait to see how it plays out, focus on you and kick some ass.\n\nGood luck", "OP, you have too much identifying info in this post.", "Stopping putting in effort only hurts you. Letting her go and experience what it's like to be so far out of her element is probably more of a punishment for her.", "YTA. And you\u2019d better get used to the idea that less qualified people get into the same position as you do, and sometimes even better than you. It\u2019s a fact of life unfortunately.", "NTA. But pls continue your karate! Don\u2019t self sabotage, what your sister is doing has nothing to do with your hard work and effort to get to this point. That was all you.\n\nHonestly your parents should be focusing on something your sister IS good at, I feel like they\u2019re doing her a disservice. She\u2019s not learning how to manager herself and they are delaying her growth and success. \n\n(Your parents\u2019 attitude reminds me of so many of those parents that has a \u201cgolden child\u201d but then when the other child is all successful they come crying like you should take care of them now, and the golden child did nothing with their life and still living with parents.)\n\nDespite your sister \u201cgetting away with\u201d not putting in the hard work, focus that energy on yourself so you can continue to learn skills in becoming successful in your life.", "NTA but I would report them to the governing body instead if they did this. Otherwise, if they get caught it would look bad on you by association.", "She's got the connections to get on the team, and it would benefit her education-wise to do so. The only objections are that it's not purely fair, not 'playing the game', 'not cricket'.\n\nChinese sport, Chinese rules.", "If you want some old man advice, then here it is! NTA because you have worked hard to get where you are and have integrity in your reasoning. \nDon't harm yourself by pulling out. Do this for you! \nThere is nothing wrong with voicing your opinion to your coaches and parents, you have genuine concerns and and it is grown up to express this! \nTalk to your sister, explain how you feel to her, put your arm around her and tell her if she does go you will both have a great time. If anyone says anything to you about your sisters ability just ask them to keep their opinions to themselves. \nLastly, congratulations", "ESH. Except you.  \nDoes your sister WANT to do this?  Because once it becomes obvious (and I bet it will) That she really has no business on a team competing at that level, no good can come of it and the dishonesty will show itself. Also, it is INSANELY unethical of your parents to condone this for the sake of embellishing a college application or the coaches to pull strings to put her there.  It's an insult to those on the team who earned their spot honestly.", "Her sister is also taking the spot away from someone else who worked hard and would be more qualified. OP is not an asshole for having integrity.", "You have no idea the amount of time and commitment it takes for someone to get to this level.  It's like telling an Olympic competitor who is competing for their country they are going to throw in a sibling who hasn't trained or completed at Olympic level they get to compete too.  They haven't put in the time and don't deserve the opportunity, but hey let's show the world how mediocre our country is in the Olympics.  No.  It's not ethical and will make the dojo a laughingstock.  In this case find another dojo and leave the sister with the old one.", "Wow.  She's not the asshole in any way shape or form.  They system failed her.  The dojo failed her.  Her parents failed her.  Her sister failed her.  This is HER story.  She needs to find a dojo with standards and win for the US Team.", "My God this is such bad advice.   Don't settle.  You worked for it and deserve to be on the US Team.  Your sister hasn't won competitions, and your dojo obviously has no standards.  Don't give up your dreams find a REPUTABLE dojo.\n\nAnd for godsakes if you have a shit manager in the future who takes credit for your work and doesn't value you.  FIND A COMPANY THAT DOES.  These fucking Redditors that accept mediocrity DESERVE to wallow in it.  You're so much better that this.", "I understand it bothers you. However there is a saying in life:\n\nThe only time you look at your neighbour's plate should be to make sure it is full.\n\nYou should focus on yourself and your achievements, not your sister.", "Don\u2019t self sabotage here. Competing on the us team would be badass. That\u2019s something you\u2019ll remember for the rest of your life. Don\u2019t cut off your nose to spite your face.", "hmm.. that's a fair point.\n\nBut I guess I'm just not sure what OP is... idk... aiming for?\n\nI'm not really sure I understand the context... it's just a little confusing lol", "I don\u2019t disagree at all that the system and all the other people and groups you list failed her. At best, though, that would take it to an E S H, because she\u2019s being an AH to herself if she stops putting in effort. As I said, what does that prove? It\u2019s a sucky situation, but just basically stopping putting forth effort hurts the team as a whole and more importantly, herself. Effort is what moves you forward. What is achieved by dropping effort other than losing. As another commenter put it, it\u2019s cutting off your nose to spite your face.", "This is not the ultimate way to happiness.   Never let anyone live off the back of your hard work.  Be a better Britney and tell Jaime Spears and Jamie-Lynn Spears to GET A REAL JOB.", "I agree. And unfortunately I have a feeling that it\u2019s going to be difficult to get any of the adults in your life onboard with that. I think the best thing you can do is support her and recognize her individual achievements.  You love Kung Fu and have put the work in to be really good at it and that\u2019s awesome! It\u2019s pretty sucky that your parents are just seeing the results of that and not understanding why you got those results.  Your sister doesn\u2019t have that drive because her motivation is being pushed on her instead of being the chance to find her passion the way you did. It ends up hurting both of you in different ways even if it\u2019s just because your parents want you to succeed."]}
