It's just a little suburban ranch home with a back yard, perfect for a single family. He bought the house before we met, so I didn't have an input into the house at all. \n\nHe bought a fixer-upper house for around 80k, when other similar houses were 120k. The house had no AC, and needed work. There was a hole in the kitchen counter, obvious poor patchwork on the walls, wall to wall carpet that cover asbestos tile floors, ect. Since I moved in (2019) only more issues have cropped up, like the ceiling in the garage collapsed because of the humidity affecting the drywall and we even have an internal wall that now moves if you shake it. \n\nAfter I moved in, I was able to motivate him into some things. We installed AC and removed the carpet and asbestos tiles and now have LVP instead of carpet that smells like urine. We had our first child in 2021 and since then... nothing has gotten fixed. \n\nI keep bringing up how things need done, and he gets irritated about it and then apologizes for how things are but things continue to not be done. I'm his wife but I'm not the owner, my name is not on the deed and frankly I don't want to be. I didn't contribute towards the purchase of the house and I don't think I'm entitled to it in any way. \n\nWe now have 2 kids and nothing here is changing. Twice in the past month we've talked about this and I'm starting to feel like a nag. I finally admitted to him that I really resent living here, that I didn't pick this house and I hate living in the fixer-upper house that's never fixed and that while I want things to change I'm getting tired of being the only one who wants to get things done. \n\nI don't expect things to be done immediately, I never have. But he refuses to even make plans and I'm getting really tired of it. His argument is time and money, but the man refuses to even look into things and make a budget. We aren't hurting for money, we are firmly middle class, and we have savings. I am not able to access our finances and currently don't work as daycare for 2 in our area would be more expensive than my income and we don't have family able to help with the children. \n\nHe is currently angrily cleaning the kitchen because I brought it up again today that we shouldn't have a hole in our counter for over 6 years.\n\nEdit to add: in terms of finances, it isn't an abuse scenario. I have access to all bank statements and they come in the mail monthly, I just am not on said accounts because I have premarital debt. I'm behind on payments and they can take from any accounts my name is on. I do not want his accounts accessed because of my debt. I do have a credit card linked to his account that I use.\n\nETA/Update: we talked a bit more, we're going to make a list of things we want and need changed in the house and then prioritize it. I will talk to him about paying off my debt (only about 2k in student loans, it's nothing crazy) and budgeting out a fund just for the house.", "created_utc": 1697401418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178o4pz/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_hate_our_house/", "score": 405, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To me, this is a major red flag. Is this something he insisted on? Something you've discussed?", "Nta. You two need to have a good conversation about renovations. My recommendation would be pick a project, research it, and price it out. Then come to your husband and let him know I did some research. This is what we should do next. This is the upper end of the budget and what it would look like. And here is the lower end. \n\nAlso\u2026you need to have more conversations about having access to your joint finances. For all you know you don\u2019t have the amount of money you think you have.", "This whole thing is weird. You aren\u2019t on the accounts because you are behind in your $2k of debt payments. But you have savings and money to do renovations? You can\u2019t work because daycare is expensive? \n\nIf you can\u2019t earn money outside the house because you are a SAHM then the savings should be used to pay your debt. How do you expect to pay them ever? How if your husband comfortable damaging your credit this whole time? Your home should be safe for your kids to live in. You need to ask why your husband isn\u2019t on board with these things.\n\nI also think you need to look closely at your situation. You say you don\u2019t want to be on accounts etc. Is it truly that you don\u2019t want to see what the financial situation is in real time and have full access or have conversations convinced you that this is the right course? I ask only because if you\u2019ve talked to your husband and left those conversations with the feeling you should not be attached to the money in the household\u2026.that\u2019s a red flag to me. If this was truly all your idea before he opened his mouth, I encourage you to investigate how you can have access without compromising things. But mostly I encourage you to pay the $2k with the money you think can be used for renovations so there\u2019s a fresh start and you can be a full partner without any excuses.", "This doesn't make sense.  \n\nHow did you get your debt down to only $2k unless he's been paying it off since you're a SAHM?  And if he has been paying it down, why doesn't he just pay the last $2k and get it over with?  If you're slowly paying it down via other means, why not have him pay it off and you repay him the same way?\n\nEven though you're not on his accounts, you said you have access to the monthly bank statements so you can easily make a budget and look into costs.  Why not get his password so you can see the accounts in real time via computer?  Since you have a credit card linked to his account, you could use that to pay for the repairs as well.  You keep saying it's his house, your name is not on the deed, etc., so make a budget of repairs from his account and start scheduling the repairs.\n\nIf your husband balks at paying for repairs, point out that a basic countertop is a few hundred dollars - way cheaper than paying hospital bills if one of the kids manages to get onto the countertop and breaks an arm playing around the hole.  The moving wall is another \"what's cheaper, fixing this wall or risking the kids getting hurt by it?\"", "You have a bunch of debt, are a one income household, and have 2 kids of daycare age.

You said it yourself that the amount you would earn is less than what you would be paying for _just childcare._ That means that the amount you are saving by being the main care provider is the _minimum_ amount that that are contributing financially to the family right now. Pretty sure that wherever you live, it wouldn\u2019t take you more than two months to earn $2000. Pay that debt off immediately with family income so that you can start budgeting for the home repairs! \n\nYou keep saying that it\u2019s not financial abuse, but your attitude that it\u2019s okay for you to have minimal say over how finances are directed along with your willingness to destroy your own credit because you aren\u2019t earning \u201cyou own\u201d money tells a different story.", "The two of you clearly need to get on the same page in terms of finances.

AS PARTNERS, you need to make your home safe for your children. Who cares about cosmetic fixes? But holes, asbestos, walls and ceilings that are collapsing... It's not okay to ignore hazards. If he's unwilling to fix it himself, then start shopping for contractors, which THE PARTNERS will pay for out of THE PARTNERS' savings. If this sounds like a conversation you can't have, then you need to rethink what financial abuse actually looks like. I've been there. I believed all the reasons why it was okay for me not to have an equal voice in our finances. I spent 29 years as a diminishing partner in my own life.

You are in a very bad situation, how did you not see that. He is trapping you.", "Random idea on how to approach this without feeling like a nag: watch a couple of episodes of Fixer Upper or other house renovation programs together. See if it gets him inspired. Talk about it what projects you think you could tackle together and learn why it\u2019s important to bring in a professional for some of it. Perhaps if you are willing to take in the project management of the improvements he will be more willing but it might just feel like an overwhelming task for him and a little motivation and inspiration might light the fire you need without the nagging. Renovation is hard on people and he might be taking it kind of personally - you see it as a hole in the counter but what  he might be hearing is you criticizing him. Good luck!", "INFO\n\nwhy can't you make plans and come to him with specific projects in mind, with a budget and list of materials/contractors as needed?", "Esh. You are hurting for money if your premarital debts are so large that you fear adding your name to joint accounts or the house title.\n\nCould this be the reason there\u2019s no movement on repairs?\n\nThe best solution may be to sell this house and move into a modest mine in ready home.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re in the financial situation to change anything right now anyway. \n\nIt seems like you\u2019re expecting him to do it himself, out of his own pocket, but to please you?\n\nYTA.", "  NTA. Since we're in the same boat maybe we should share a  bottle of wine for the ride.\nMy husband can fix anything, the problem is motivating him to work on the house of 15 years of renovation. I think you understand, I can help do the work but I can't do it by myself. He has a hard time focusing on one project. I really believe he is always looking at the big picture and it's overwhelming.\n The solution that is helping after over a decade is putting a stupid dry erase board in the kitchen. Every month we can decide what needs to be done and allocate time. Say fix drywall in guest room, 5 hours Saturday. Install ceiling fan in guest room, 2 hours Sunday. \n We don't always finish our \"chore list\" every weekend but it makes it easier to look at it in small chunks.

Also how the fuck do you have a hole in the kitchen counter top for 6+years? It\u2019s not that hard to fix a hole even if it\u2019s in a material like Marble or concrete although I\u2019m going to guess wooden/timber counter tops which is a hell of a lot easier to fix. TLDR your husband sounds really lazy.", "NTA.  What is this\u2026..you don\u2019t have access to finances?  There are more problems here than the house being bad.

I know you said you\u2019ve chatted but maybe help him make a budget or say to set aside X amount per month.

This is how many people are trapped in marriages, can't get out and don't even know how to go through a divorce since they have no idea what the family finances even look like. \n\nAs someone who buys fixer uppers, your husband isn't really actively doing that. If anything, he bought it because it was cheap and is happy as is. Most people aren't spreading renos out over 6 years for things like a hole in the countertop. I think he's happy with the status quo and has no desire to take on any of the remaining projects. He views you as a nag. \n\nHe isn't even getting quotes to help budget for projects one by one because he doesn't care to do it. I have a hunch if you didn't enter his life, the house wouldn't even have the updates it has since you moved in. Quotes are free. I would google and find some reputable companies for the smaller jobs and ask them to come bid on it and have separate pricing per project so you can piecemeal this. Then you take him several quotes and you can pick one and start with something smaller or bigger, whatever you two can agree on.", "NTA\n\nIt is reasonable to expect to live in a decent house.\n\nHe needs to concentrate on 1 room at a time, starting with the kitchen.", "Get out.", "If you're so well off hire a contractor", "ETA he needs to get his ass in gear and sort things but at the same time be glad you have a home, people are struggling to pay rent these days with the cost of living crisis and can only dream of owning their own home", "NTA. The house is falling apart, clearly. While some comfort items have been replaced, a wall moving is never a good sign. While the wall in question may not be a load-bearing wall, having a weakened wall can cause other issues down the road. It also indicates that there is a deeper issue that needs to be addressed. Is the wall weakened from water damage? Is the wall weakened from termite or animal damage? Is the wall weakened from mold? These are all issues that can spread to other walls and other places in the home. It's not something to ignore. It is a genuine safety concern and could lead to real damage or even a loss of life. Depending on the issue, the house could or even should be condemned.", "YTA for framing it as \"I am not able to access our finances\" when the reality is that you *can't* have your name on anything because of your premarital debt & you have access to a credit card and info on all the accounts. \n\nWhy didn't you make a plan to pay off your debt & get everything done on the house *before* you had kids?  Why can't you handle smaller projects yourself?  Why don't you get a PT job or figure out a way to bring in some cash to get your debt paid off?  If you're only paying $50/month toward a $2000 debt do you realize how long that will take and how much extra interest you (or, more accurately, your husband) will be paying?

If able to afford it , that stuff should be getting fixed. As for the fact you have no access to money, you need to start protecting yourself; it's not normal for a spouse to not have free range to access money and should be seen as both your money. You mention debt, is he afraid you aren't good with money? Does he have any reason to not have you as a user on the accounts? And even if middle class, you don't work, it's one salary paying for everything, which is probably very stressful assuming he is working a demanding full time job. Could it be he just needs help with getting quotes from contractors to get the ball rolling? Have you offered this? As for changing homes, he probably locked a good rate and it would be impossible to get a similar loan in the near future to move to a better home.", "NTA. Give him a deadline to either do the work himself or call contractors for what needs to be done.

Not on the house deed, no access to finances, and not working? This is a recipe for disaster. Not the asshole but he sure is, and it has nothing to do with his inability to perform house repairs", "NTA. But I think instead of just complaining about it it's time to make a plan. Sit down with him and list out *everything* that needs fixed. Then start into researching how much you estimate it will cost - whether it's just materials and y'all will do it, or pay someone else entirely. Then prioritize the list in order that you can make it happen. Either snowball method - start with the cheapest/easiest. Or avalanche method - start with the most important to you. \n\nThen talk about budget. How much money can he start putting toward getting this stuff done off each paycheck. Maybe it's going to require you helping too. Can you get a part time gig babysitting another kid? Or walking a neighbor's dog? Anything you can put toward helping this could make it go a lot faster. I'm a mom too, so I understand it can be really hard to help. I like flipping furniture that I can get off FB marketplace.", "NTA. \nYou don't hate the house. You hate living in a construction zone. This is completely reasonable.\nYou are a stay at home Mum to 2 children. \nYou say you could not earn enough to pay for the  childcare you would need to work. You should not have to pay all the childcare costs. If you went to work, you would share childcare costs with your husband, and some of your earnings would go towards paying off your debts. This would get you to a point where you can share the finances and start budgeting for the repairs your husband has been putting off. \nIf you both prefer you to  stay home, then your husband needs to give you money towards household expenses, but also an allowance for yourself (you share the money left over from his salary after paying the monthly bills), as you are a full time Mum, which is a job. You cost him a lot less than contracted out childcare, as you are looking after your own children. \nYour allowance would be yours, and if you used it to pay off your debts, it would be you paying them off, not your husband.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
