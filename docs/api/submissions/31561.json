An hour into the party I see my mother leaving.\u201d\n\nWhich one of these sentences is factual:   1. Mom left before the party started?  Or   \n2. Mom left an hour into the party?\n\nAm leaning toward YTA based on the incongruency of your statements.  \n\nAccepting that Mom stayed for an hour, what amount of time was the correct amount of time to spend at a child\u2019s birthday party?  Maybe mom feels like she has to lie to get you off her back with unreasonable expectations.  While I think lying is an AH thing to do, I also think one hour at a kiddie party is an acceptable amount of time.  Mom\u2019s time is hers, not yours.", "Slight YTA. The fact that you mentioned no one from your side of the family showed up but your mom tells me you were already mad at that and took that out on your mom. Would you have been as mad if you had a large turn out from your side of the family and she left early? I am thinking no.\n\nShe showed up, that is what counts. Showed up at an event hosted by the other side of the family as the only member of yours and stayed for a decent amount of time. It is tough being the only member of my family at in-law events. Unless you are close to people in the other family who do you socialize with? The birthday kid has many people trying to interact with him, and the grandma hosting would likely take issue with your mom monopolizing his time. You her daughter need to attend to all the party guests. Your in-law have family connections, and I am betting their own kids to watch, or are connected as family in small set up groups. Even without having her well deserved own social life I would not blame her for not staying for an entire party. \n\nPlus you start you are upset partly because your son was so happy to see her, and he likes to spend time with her. How then does it make sense for you to ignore her. You are mad she isn\u2019t spending as much time as you want her to\nwith your kid, but ignoring her means she will spend even less.", "YTA. \nYour timing of when she left was very contradicting. She SHOWED UP to your kiddo\u2019s bday, that\u2019s what mattered. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve left her some point to do your own things, whether it be plans w others, go home to rest, be with your past gf/wife w.e. \n\nHow about \u201cThanks for showing up grandma, we appreciated your presence\u201d.", "YTA.\n\nI personally think that not many people showed up. You were already emotionally worked up. The fact that someone did show up, who you acknowledge your son loves, and then leaves does not make them an ass hole.\n\nHow do you not know that they delayed their plans just to make time to see their grandson? They turned up, made themselves valid, and even told the truth. She didn't lie and say oh somethings come up.\" She told you why she is leaving.\n\nIn the same way, would you want your mum to feel like YTA for one day, leaving her to go watch your sons football?\n\nShe's probably lonely and tried her best to juggle both engagements. Don't be too hard on her.", ">Before the party started my mother had to leave. An hour into the party I see my mother leaving.\n\nWhat is it? Before the party or an hour into the party?\n\n>No one from my side of the family showed up with the exception of my mother.\n\nHmm wonder why? Maybe mother had other reasons to leave after an hour. \n\n> I just feel angry and kind of let down the my mother is choosing some guy over her grandson.\n\nShe was at the party. Grandson surely was planning to spend every minute with grandma.\n\n>that she sees him a lot less when she\u2019s involved with someone\n\nSo this is your problem? That your mother lives her life and not only lives for your kid? \n\nYTA", "YTA. She made an hour long appearance. How long did this party run anyhow?", "YTA! She was there for the party, right? You make it sound like she was a no show. \n\nAlso there is nothing wrong with her wanting to see someone. Your mother has a right to live her own life. \n\nIf you don't want her complaining about not seeing her grandchild enough, talk to her like an adult. Don't ignore her. And her dating someone has no bearing on how much she sees her grandson. She has a right to live her life the way she sees fit.", "She came to the party just couldn\u2019t stay more than an hour\n\nAn hour is completely reasonable!  \n\nAs to not seeing him enough, she means 1 on 1 time.  Seeing him while he\u2019s got other stuff going isn\u2019t the same.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of weird to me the kid would care about relatives if his friends were invited and there were activities.  Does he not have friends?\n\nEdit: yta", "I think you're being a bit overbearing\nYour mother showed up, enjoyed her time.\nThere isn't a rule that says people cannot split their time.\nYou don't \"own her time for the day\".\nRelax.", "YTA she showed up! Her life does not revolve around you and your child, she has other things to do, it sounds like she is a good grandma for being there. She could have skipped like the rest of your family. Why did they skip anyway? Maybe you are a bit much?", "YTA. Her being the only one from your side to show up leads me to believe there\u2019s something that you\u2019re not telling us. \n\nAfter greeting the guest of honor and taking some photos, adults role at kid\u2019s birthday parties is to monitor their kid, which doesn\u2019t apply to her, help with games, serving food etc., which also doesn\u2019t apply since it wasn\u2019t her home and she wasn\u2019t part of the planning, or chat with other adults, which she probably didn\u2019t know many of since nobody else on your side came. \n\nAlso it\u2019s not unreasonable that she sees him less when dating, just like I\u2019m sure you started seeing her less once your relationship got serious/you got married. That\u2019s how life and time works. You can split your time between your husband & son, your family, his family, and your friends, but she can\u2019t split her time between you guys and a man she\u2019s dating?", "NTA - if we have plans and you jump ship for a date thats an ass move, if the plans are kids/grandkids birthday you are a double ass. some date IS more important to her than your kid.", "Yta she's allowed to have a life. The world doesn't revolve around ur kid. Stop acting childish", "slight yta.  I understand that you want to protect your child and avoid any upset on his birthday. However, Your mom made an appearance and did stay at the party for an hour.  If you are upset, it's better to talk about it than just ignoring her.", "This is a very small YTA, I understand that there might be some hurt feelings here, but your mom did stay for the better part of an hour for your son, I think you should talk about it with her, ignoring her, might be going a little bit too far.\n\nOP I\u2019m gonna give you 1/5 bad guys, I understand you\u2019re upset for your son at your mom for leaving early, but she did stay for the better part of an hour for your son.\n\nI\u2019m giving your mom 0/5 bad guys.", "YTA, I get wanting her to be there on your kid\u2019s birthday but she has a life of her own. She\u2019s allowed to have her own life and tbf it\u2019s natural to spend more time with the person you\u2019re involved with", "I have to say NTA because the mother complained about not seeing the kid then leaves and then lies about why she\u2019s leaving. It all just seems like the mother attended some work party and not her grandkids birthday. The grandkid she apparently doesn\u2019t see enough.", "NTA my parents wouldn\u2019t do that", "Nta call your mom out and explain she needs to put in the effort and stop complaining", "Nta", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If no one showed up is it because it was thrown at the in-laws? Mom's dating if she chose her date she would not have been there for an hour. YTA  because you come off like you expect your mom to not have a life.", "Who plans a date for the same day/time as their grandson's birthday party? There were literally no other times or days available they could meet? Thats a shitty grandparent.", "You conveniently left out some parts and completely misread others. Sounds like the mom left for a date after complaining about not seeing the grandkid enough. And then lied about why she was leaving.", "The grandmother was there for the birthday, she stayed there for an hour and then left.", "And then lying about it! That\u2019s the clue she knows it\u2019s not kosher to do.", "365 days of the year and she had to plan a date for the same day and time as her grandson's birthday party? It's not like its a random day, its the kid's birthday. She couldn't go one day without a date?", "I forgot to add that she lied to us about it saying it was because she didn\u2019t want to drive home in the dark but that wasn\u2019t the case", "Mom gets a 0/5 for lying instead of being upfront and adult? Seems legit. I mean she COULD HAVE just originally said I have dual plans and can only be there for about an hour. She COULD HAVE handled it in a way that DIDN'T leave her grandkid distraught about her absence. Grandma is definitely TA if for nothing else but her poor planning and poor execution. \n(OP is TA for the ignoring as well, but given the example OP was obviously raised under, it makes sense that reaction outweighs adult communication.)", "You obviously didn\u2019t read it fully. No one showed up besides he from \u201cmy side of the family\u201d", "My grandma didn\u2019t come to my parties - I was busy with my friends!  An hour drop by is plenty.  I\u2019d never expect a kid to want the adults to stay longer when the friends are there", "We don\u2019t know the details though. \n\nNobody else from her side showing up leaves a lot of possibilities other than just shitty grandparent.", "We don't know the situation and therefore shouldn't assume that they're a shittty grandparent, for turning up albeit an hour.\n\nWhat if they are struggling financially and could only make it happen on that day? Not everyone has the best and most flexible employers. What if they simply couldn't get the time off?\n\nMaybe she was considerate, and instead of making an excuse like everyone else did, she turned up at least and managed to juggle both things.\n\nI'm not saying or condoning how a grand parent should be. But she was the only one who turned up and is entitled to her own life.", "she left for a date after being there for an hour. She clearly wants to see them more often not for longer at a time. And of course she lied about why she was leaving, look at OPs reaction", "She surely meant seeing the kid regularly not just on a one time a year event. And the kid surely didn't spend all the time with grandma. We don't know the age of the son but that is very unlikely that the kid would care so much when exactly grandma left. \n\nAnd still my point stands that she can have a partner and see the kid. There is nothing wrong with only staying an hour when she is the only one of her family side there and the parents and kid probably being busy with entertaining other guests as well.\n\nAlso it isn't even clear she lied about not wanting to drive in the dark. It is completely possible she wanted to drive home early AND have a date later where she doesn't drive? If she never planned to stay until after dark there is no reason why she couldn't plan a different activity later in the evening that doesn't involve driving. If she planned to go with a lie she wouldn't have told about the date? That would be rather stupid, no?", "if a date is worth ditching your grandkid after an hour on their birthdayparty id consider you a horrible grandparent and person in general :)\n\nthese things mean the world to children", "I\u2019m thinking scheduling the date so that she would have to leave after an hour was almost a way out for her. She showed up, she wanted her grandson to know that she was there. But, it sounds like it\u2019s probably a pretty awkward social situation. Nobody else from her side of the family showed up? Usually not a great sign.\n\nAlso curious how old the grandson was turning. Either way, birthday parties usually aren\u2019t a great bonding time. The kids have other things they\u2019re interested in. So I could see why she wants to spend more time with him, but didn\u2019t see the birthday party as quality time. I\u2019m thinking his mom being upset that grandma left probably upset the kid more than grandma actually leaving.\n\nI\u2019ve been to every birthday party for my niece and nephews for the entire party. I promise you, the only time anybody even knew I was there is if somebody got hurt and they needed Aunt Nurse.", "Most people don\u2019t celebrate bdays on the day off, you don\u2019t block out your calendar just in case.", "Yes. She's entitled to have her date whenever. The world doesn't revolve around the kid. She came by and had other plans.", "So? How does it matter. Maybe she doesn't feel comfortable and doesn't want to grab attention in the wrong way. She stayed in the party for an hour?", "It\ud83d\udc4f Doesn't \ud83d\udc4f Matter. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nShe came.\nShe stayed a reasonable amount of time.\nShe left. \n\nHer reason for leaving is none of your business.", "So then how do you know that she left for a date?", "Gma literally told them upfront she couldn\u2019t stay.  It\u2019s in the post\n\nShe came for an hour and then went on to next thing, completely perfect time planning", "And why is that?", "May I ask how old your son is? Was this his 1st birthday, 5th, 10th, etc.?", "Op reacted this way because of the lie. That\u2019s half of what she\u2019s mad about.", "She told me just prior to leaving", "Actually it doesn't state ANYWHERE in the post that she was upfront with her grandchild. If she had executed 'perfect planning' there would be no reason for her grandchild to be upset at her absence, as the child would have been given the expectation of her leaving.", "Huh? You just said she told you she was leaving because she didn\u2019t want to drive in the dark. Which is it?", "She told OP.   \n\nAs a kid I wouldn\u2019t expect to get a play by play from adults, they communicate to each other \n\n The kid is at his other grandparents house with other there"]}
