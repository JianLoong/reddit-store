An hour into the party I see my mother leaving.\u201d\n\nWhich one of these sentences is factual:   1. Mom left before the party started?  Or   \n2. Mom left an hour into the party?\n\nAm leaning toward YTA based on the incongruency of your statements.  \n\nAccepting that Mom stayed for an hour, what amount of time was the correct amount of time to spend at a child\u2019s birthday party?  Maybe mom feels like she has to lie to get you off her back with unreasonable expectations.  While I think lying is an AH thing to do, I also think one hour at a kiddie party is an acceptable amount of time.  Mom\u2019s time is hers, not yours.", "Slight YTA. The fact that you mentioned no one from your side of the family showed up but your mom tells me you were already mad at that and took that out on your mom. Would you have been as mad if you had a large turn out from your side of the family and she left early? I am thinking no.\n\nShe showed up, that is what counts. Showed up at an event hosted by the other side of the family as the only member of yours and stayed for a decent amount of time. It is tough being the only member of a blood family family at in-law events. Unless you are close to people in the other family who do you socialize with? The birthday kid has many people trying to interact with him, and the grandma hosting would likely take issue with your mom monopolizing his time. You, her daughter need to attend to all the party guests, you weren\u2019t interacting with her a lot as by your own words you noticed by chance she was leaving. Your in-law have family connections, and I am betting their own kids to watch, or are connected as family in small set up groups. Even without having her well deserved own social life I would not blame her for not staying for an entire party. \n\nPlus you start you are upset partly because your son was so happy to see her, and he likes to spend time with her. How then does it make sense for you to ignore her.? You are mad she isn\u2019t spending as much time with her grandkid as you or your son want, but ignoring her means she will spend even less. So you in a sense causing your son the exact hurt You are mad at her for causing him.", "YTA. \nYour timing of when she left was very contradicting. She SHOWED UP to your kiddo\u2019s bday, that\u2019s what mattered. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve left her some point to do your own things, whether it be plans w others, go home to rest, be with your past gf/wife w.e. \n\nHow about \u201cThanks for showing up grandma, we appreciated your presence\u201d.", "YTA.\n\nI personally think that not many people showed up. You were already emotionally worked up. The fact that someone did show up, who you acknowledge your son loves, and then leaves does not make them an ass hole.\n\nHow do you not know that they delayed their plans just to make time to see their grandson? They turned up, made themselves valid, and even told the truth. She didn't lie and say oh somethings come up.\" She told you why she is leaving.\n\nIn the same way, would you want your mum to feel like YTA for one day, leaving her to go watch your sons football?\n\nShe's probably lonely and tried her best to juggle both engagements. Don't be too hard on her.", ">Before the party started my mother had to leave. An hour into the party I see my mother leaving.\n\nWhat is it? Before the party or an hour into the party?\n\n>No one from my side of the family showed up with the exception of my mother.\n\nHmm wonder why? Maybe mother had other reasons to leave after an hour. \n\n> I just feel angry and kind of let down the my mother is choosing some guy over her grandson.\n\nShe was at the party. Grandson surely was planning to spend every minute with grandma.\n\n>that she sees him a lot less when she\u2019s involved with someone\n\nSo this is your problem? That your mother lives her life and not only lives for your kid? \n\nYTA", "YTA. She made an hour long appearance. How long did this party run anyhow?", "YTA! She was there for the party, right? You make it sound like she was a no show. \n\nAlso there is nothing wrong with her wanting to see someone. Your mother has a right to live her own life. \n\nIf you don't want her complaining about not seeing her grandchild enough, talk to her like an adult. Don't ignore her. And her dating someone has no bearing on how much she sees her grandson. She has a right to live her life the way she sees fit.", "She came to the party just couldn\u2019t stay more than an hour\n\nAn hour is completely reasonable!  \n\nAs to not seeing him enough, she means 1 on 1 time.  Seeing him while he\u2019s got other stuff going isn\u2019t the same.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of weird to me the kid would care about relatives if his friends were invited and there were activities.  Does he not have friends?\n\nEdit: yta", "I think you're being a bit overbearing\nYour mother showed up, enjoyed her time.\nThere isn't a rule that says people cannot split their time.\nYou don't \"own her time for the day\".\nRelax.", "YTA she showed up! Her life does not revolve around you and your child, she has other things to do, it sounds like she is a good grandma for being there. She could have skipped like the rest of your family. Why did they skip anyway? Maybe you are a bit much?", "YTA. Her being the only one from your side to show up leads me to believe there\u2019s something that you\u2019re not telling us. \n\nAfter greeting the guest of honor and taking some photos, adults role at kid\u2019s birthday parties is to monitor their kid, which doesn\u2019t apply to her, help with games, serving food etc., which also doesn\u2019t apply since it wasn\u2019t her home and she wasn\u2019t part of the planning, or chat with other adults, which she probably didn\u2019t know many of since nobody else on your side came. \n\nAlso it\u2019s not unreasonable that she sees him less when dating, just like I\u2019m sure you started seeing her less once your relationship got serious/you got married. That\u2019s how life and time works. You can split your time between your husband & son, your family, his family, and your friends, but she can\u2019t split her time between you guys and a man she\u2019s dating?", "NTA - if we have plans and you jump ship for a date thats an ass move, if the plans are kids/grandkids birthday you are a double ass. some date IS more important to her than your kid.", "Yta she's allowed to have a life.

Seems legit. I mean she COULD HAVE just originally said I have dual plans and can only be there for about an hour. She COULD HAVE handled it in a way that DIDN'T leave her grandkid distraught about her absence. Grandma is definitely TA if for nothing else but her poor planning and poor execution. \n(OP is TA for the ignoring as well, but given the example OP was obviously raised under, it makes sense that reaction outweighs adult communication.)", "You obviously didn\u2019t read it fully. No one showed up besides he from \u201cmy side of the family\u201d", "My grandma didn\u2019t come to my parties - I was busy with my friends!  An hour drop by is plenty.  I\u2019d never expect a kid to want the adults to stay longer when the friends are there", "We don\u2019t know the details though. \n\nNobody else from her side showing up leaves a lot of possibilities other than just shitty grandparent.", "We don't know the situation and therefore shouldn't assume that they're a shittty grandparent, for turning up albeit an hour.\n\nWhat if they are struggling financially and could only make it happen on that day? Not everyone has the best and most flexible employers. What if they simply couldn't get the time off?\n\nMaybe she was considerate, and instead of making an excuse like everyone else did, she turned up at least and managed to juggle both things.\n\nI'm not saying or condoning how a grand parent should be. But she was the only one who turned up and is entitled to her own life.", "she left for a date after being there for an hour. She clearly wants to see them more often not for longer at a time. And of course she lied about why she was leaving, look at OPs reaction", "She surely meant seeing the kid regularly not just on a one time a year event. And the kid surely didn't spend all the time with grandma. We don't know the age of the son but that is very unlikely that the kid would care so much when exactly grandma left. \n\nAnd still my point stands that she can have a partner and see the kid. There is nothing wrong with only staying an hour when she is the only one of her family side there and the parents and kid probably being busy with entertaining other guests as well.\n\nAlso it isn't even clear she lied about not wanting to drive in the dark. It is completely possible she wanted to drive home early AND have a date later where she doesn't drive? If she never planned to stay until after dark there is no reason why she couldn't plan a different activity later in the evening that doesn't involve driving. If she planned to go with a lie she wouldn't have told about the date?

She showed up, she wanted her grandson to know that she was there. But, it sounds like it\u2019s probably a pretty awkward social situation. Nobody else from her side of the family showed up? Usually not a great sign.\n\nAlso curious how old the grandson was turning. Either way, birthday parties usually aren\u2019t a great bonding time. The kids have other things they\u2019re interested in. So I could see why she wants to spend more time with him, but didn\u2019t see the birthday party as quality time. I\u2019m thinking his mom being upset that grandma left probably upset the kid more than grandma actually leaving.\n\nI\u2019ve been to every birthday party for my niece and nephews for the entire party.

I know it's Thanksgiving in the US. \n\nI wonder if the OP lives in the US and planned his birthday on Thanksgiving.\n\nThat would make sense as to why none of her side of the family showed up if they were having their Thanksgiving celebrations. Maybe Grandma was having Thanksgiving dinner with her date.\n\nThe OP has not said how old the child is and what kind of birthday party it was. Were there lots of kids? Adults?", "JFC.  People are so entitled.  Maybe the guy she is seeing had a busy schedule.  Maybe she does.  But how dare she have personal plans on the same day.", "Did you miss the full party, or did you pop in then leave?", "\ud83e\udd23", "Reality check. I had a set of grandparents who literally didn't show up. She did. Your post suggested that there were other family members that could've (maybe even should've) come, but didn't. Why are you upset with her, but not the ones who didn't show up at all?", "You\u2019re just not explaining yourself fully. What exactly does this mean? Maybe she didn\u2019t *want* to drive in the dark, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t. It can just be a preference.\n\nI still want to know if she left before the party or an hour later.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not at all sure why you think ignoring the only person who showed up for your son is a viable strategy moving forward.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot missing here (why didn\u2019t the rest of your family show?) and it seems pretty likely that you\u2019re leaving info out specifically because you know it won\u2019t make you look great. But you still don\u2019t look awesome in this scenario, so\u2026", "Kid got upset and sounds young. That the kid reacted is why I can't y t a. This seems like a larger pattern", "Absolutely! The lying and priorities out of line is the problem. It\u2019s not some coworkers kids birthday, its her grandson.", "I\u2019ve been to several. They\u2019re normally a couple of hours at most. Not that hard.", "Kid sounds young. If it's a 4/5 year old then family parties are the norm. Add in kid noticed and was upset, then you got a bit of a different story going on here", "Eh, if you're always coming in short bursts, kids are going to remember that\n\nOnce it upset the kid, it became the AH move. If the kid is getting upset because grandma always bounces, the solution is grandma doesn't get invited as much until kid is old enough to handle that\n\nBut if the inlaws are more involved and for longer stretches, yeah kid is gonna bond heavier with them, which means there's more incentive for them to be around more\n\nBuilding a relationship with a kid takes more than just showing up.", "She can, but at least keep the one time a year event open for the kid.... she has 364 days. Kid wants to feel special on day 365. Once the kid got upset, it's clear the kid wasn't happy, and if it happened more than once, you can't keep inviting grandma if she's just gonna stay a little bit and bounce\n\nIf you can't even set aside the time for one party, you're not gonna be invited for weekly visits. It's a bare minimum effort that grandma can't do for her grandkid already. Why would OP risk putting herself out for frequent potential disappointments for the kid?\n\nGrandparents are not owed relationships. They have to foster the relationships. How often is she inviting grandkids out? Trying to plan visits? It's a two way street here", "Missed the whole thing.  My daughter was fine with it.  Said she would have skipped if I had another ticket!  \ud83e\udd23.  I gave him a gift and wished him a happy birthday the day before.", "Exactly.", "Something tells me OP is not an innocent victim lol", "If they\u2019re 4/5 then their reaction is going to be largely a reflection of everyone else.  If the parents have up beat energy and gratitude kids most likely won\u2019t think twice.  \n\nThey may get momentarily sad someone is leaving they\u2019re attached to but that could happen at 2 hours or 3 hours, you lead the kids appropriately.  \n\nIt\u2019s really up to the parents to guide", ">I just feel angry and kind of let down the my mother is choosing some guy over her grandson\n\nThe lie was an edit afterthought. It's not why she reacted this way and it's nowhere near half of what she is mad about", "What lie?", "An hour at a kids party is not a short burst, and the kid needs to be taught to deal with those feelings", "She showed up at the party. There is no law in the world that everyone has to stay the entire night. \n\nIf she wanted to be home before dark that is totally acceptable. If she planned something else after she got home anyway that's noones business. \n\nI don't know how old the kid is but it's ridiculous to be so sad that your grandma doesn't stay the entire party when the kid probably spend most time with other guests anyway. \n\nNowhere in the post does it say that the grandma regularly ditches the son or anything. I also don't understand the logic that if kid is so upset he didn't see grandma around for more than an hour, how son would be less upset with being forbidden any contact. \n\nAs to your last comment, again nowhere is it said that grandma is not putting in effort. On the contrary I wonder why noone else of his family side showed up at the party hosted at the in-laws. Kind of suspicious. Also with the inconsistencies in the story. \n\nBut no matter what. Showing up at a birthday is what counts. There are no laws of when you or may not leave.", "Ah, she was going to stay quiet then chickened out right as she was leaving?", "Did you host a birthday party on Thanksgiving?", "Very young kids won't and this sounds like more of a family bday party and less of a kids one. Family members, especially closer ones, will get noticed\n\nYou can stay for an hour and bounce if you are not close to the kid and won't be missed. Not the case here. Probably would have been better to just not show if it was mostly family and not the kids friends. If grandma didn't even stay for cake/presents, which is typically the minimum expected, it's kinda a big AH move\n\nAs for the not being around as much, grandma can't complain if she wants to just act like a distant relative and show up for a bit just when it's convenient. She wants a close relationship, it starts by putting effort into creating a relationship. Staying for a bday party would have been a start", "Politeness is actually you stay for cake cutting/ opening presents btw. There actually is a baseline. If she didn't stay to at least sing happy bday, it's a bit of an insult\n\nKid noticed and was upset. That's a deal, especially if the kid is younger\n\nGrandma complains she's never around, but who's inviting a close family member that won't even be upfront about things? Seriously, even saying \"oh, I already had plans, so I won't be able to stay long\" when she was invited would have been better. There's a million better ways for grandma to have handled this. Add in OP doesn't make plans with grandma apparently, this doesn't give the impression of a one off.\n\nIf the family is small and doesn't really do birthdays, not super suspicious. They just can't be surprised when the kid is closer and spends more time with the family willing to make a deal out of it.", "She said the driving after dark reason was a lie", "So the kid doesn't get informed because YOU are okay with it? \nGrandma gets a free pass on disappointing the child because YOU would be fine with it?\nBecause you decided it's unreasonable for a child to be informed. Seems legit. \nI'll keep siding with age appropriate information that keeps hurt feelings at bay and you can keep siding with \"screw the kid, they should just play and shouldn't have any expectations\" mentality. \nGrandma is TA imo. Glad grandma has a bestie in you, though. \ud83d\ude09", "Very young is exactly when you should start teaching them to deal with their feelings.\n\nYou can stay for an hour no matter who you are.", ">Politeness is actually you stay for cake cutting/ opening presents btw. There actually is a baseline. If she didn't stay to at least sing happy bday, it's a bit of an insult\n\nTrue but noone in the post is it said if it was after or before that that she left. It's not the amount of time one stays at a party but wether in that hour she had some quality time with the birthday kid. We don't know any of the details though. But suggesting that she said she didn't want to drive in the dark the party must have continued into the evening so I assume the kid is not that small still to be so distraught about not everyone staying all night? I don't think at family birthday events all people ever stayed all evening and night. It was normal for people show up, bring gifts congratulate and at some point leave. So maybe I don't really understand the whole drama about \"only\" staying an hour.", "You can, but you can also just not be invited to many things after", ">True but noone in the post is it said if it was after or before that that she left\n\nand considering that the op said that her mum left before the party started and also left an hour into the party, i'd take any details about the mother's actual attendance with a grain of salt", "I take it with a grain of salt if one says someone left becore the party and then one hour into the party which both contradicts.", "How old is your kid?

OP is in the US, and they don't even acknowledge why they wouldn't be celebrating an incredibly popular holiday. I know not everyone here does but you'd think they'd mention it. Maybe their family didn't come because they were celebrating the holiday and didn't have time to go to a birthday party as well. \n\nEven if you don't celebrate Thanksgiving, it's a damn Thursday. Who throws a birthday party on a Thursday?\n\nHonestly this story seems suspicious with all the inconsistencies and missing info.", "YTA", "All of this because she left after staying an hour and didn't divulge in the details of her romantic life?", "These aren't your parents. All parents are different.", "Honestly I think OP is the a hole cause did you notice her statement say her mom left before the party began and then said her mom left an hour into the party? Cause like to me that's giving me red flags that OP is lying a lot and trying to get pity points and almost none of us are falling for it cause her story got more holes than a very holey swiss cheese", "Isn't she the only one who actually showed up?   Looks like OP is pissed off at his entire family and taking it out on the one person who came.", "I would 100% been the same", "For me, it's really hard to believe the child wasn't rapidly distracted in his party. I think OP is making that up to justify her jealousy about her mom having a life."]}
