I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nI replied, \u201cAre you? Ok, you\u2019re sorry. Don\u2019t do it again instead of doing it and then just saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and thinking that makes it ok.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cLove you. It was not intentional.

Its your house and you set the rules and if you cant follow them then that's kind of a form of disrespect.", "NTA. He keeps doing it because he can get away with it.
