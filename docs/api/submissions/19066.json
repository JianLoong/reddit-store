It's not your fault she feels bad about herself. Sorry.", "NTA.  Her insecurities are causing her to use peer pressure tactics to get you to do what she wants you to so she can feel better about her own choices.

It's not your problem that she feels self conscious about her weight. And it seems you can't satisfy her. You stopped talking as much about yr weight. And she's still complaining. You're walking more and she found a way to complain about that. You're eating less junk food and she's complaining about that.\n\nEvery time you try to accomodate her she still finds something to complain about. This is your clue to realizing there's a part of her that loves to complain and will never be satisfied. She will keep on and on with complaining, whatever you do. And if you try to make your point about it, she accuses you of \"snapping\" and being an AH.\n\nYou're not responsible for her feeling self conscious. That's her own doing.\n\nI'd reevaluate this relationship.", "NTA. This is your GFs problem.", "NTA This is all about her insecurities. She is like a crab in a bucket trying to drag you down.

It doesn't sound like you've done anything wrong. You did this the right way, you did not say anything negative, only focused on what your goals were. You have repeatedly invited her, you haven't shamed her. That said, she seems insecure and is projecting her guilt onto you. You can't force her to join you but you can encourage her and welcome her when she does.", "NTA. \n\nShe is taking your fitness/weight loss personally and that is something she has to figure out.

That is not a supportive partner.", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty awful that she\u2019s not supporting you getting healthy. Is it possible that she has disordered eating?

It's hard for me to sympathize with people who act like your girlfriend. If she truly loved and wanted the best for you, she'd be supportive of all your efforts to become healthy again. I would even say this should even motivate her to want to be healthy with you as well. At some point, sometimes relationships end because one person's growth is stunted and the other is thriving. \n\nNeither is bad, but maybe you should consider dating someone who is your rock and will support you for making a positive change on your life rather than is selfish and wants you to stay the same so they don't feel bad about themselves..", "NTA.  Your girlfriend is simply feeling guilty that she lacks the commitment and incentive to lose her own weight when she sees and talks to you.  She may need some counseling unless she snaps herself out of feel sorry for herself.", "NTA for \"wanting to lose some weight.\"  Nor is there anything wrong with actually doing something about it and/or with watching your diet. However, if your talking about your weight and diet makes her feel bad, you should respect that.

So she's not the person to talk about progress with. If you hadn't gotten annoyed at her for setting a conversational boundary then it would be n.ta but you don't have the right to talk about whatever you want with her regardless of her feelings. You're not an asshole for wanting to lose some weight. But you are an asshole for continuing to talk to her about it when she's asked you to stop.\n\nShe sucks for wanting to control what you do. Not buying your share of junk food is a good solution, you having a hobby that doesn't include her unless she chooses to be included is reasonable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't make other people miserable just because you are", "NTA. Each of us is responsible for our own health. There is a vast difference between self care (what you are doing) and fat shaming others (how she is perceiving your actions). While I do feel for her as society has made exercise and nutrition more about beauty than health, this is her challenge to overcome. Don\u2019t sacrifice your health to appease her.", "NTA. She\u2019s clearly struggling with insecurities. Consider not looking to her for validation right now. Be happy for yourself. Know you feel better. But understand that she\u2019s struggling. You\u2019re right that when you\u2019re both in a healthy place you should be able to talk to her about something that makes you feel good but right now she\u2019s not in a healthy place. I do find that sometime when I\u2019m working hard on myself I talk about it too much. That might be the case here especially if she\u2019s struggling. Part of relationships is seeing each other through our struggles. I\u2019m sorry she can\u2019t/won\u2019t be as supportive of you as she should right now.", "NTA - you\u2019re trying to better your health.

Her cognitive distortions, she needs to deal with it", "I read a post long ago of a similar situation where someone was initially successful at losing some weight, which made their partner insecure, so they cooked delicious, unhealthy meals to sabotage their progress. Make sure that doesn't happen to you.", "NTA. This is 100% a her problem and not a you problem. \n\nDecide whether you want to be with someone who is willing to jeopardize your long-term health over their own self image issues. \n\nStory time: my SIL pulled this crap on my bro. \n\nShe would get mad if he lost weight/ate healthy/watched what he ate, so he got really big. Note: I\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t eat all the food willingly, he did, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s hard enough to eat healthier/smaller portions if your partner is then adding on making it harder. And if your partner is 100% opposed to an active lifestyle. \n\nMy bro got pretty big until he went in for an annual check-up and the docs told him he was pre-diabetic, his blood pressure was awful as was his cholesterol and they wouldn\u2019t give him a needed surgery as he was high risk due to weight. \n\nFortunately that was a wake up call and he\u2019s lost 80 pounds over the past year. And got the surgery.  \n\nBut it\u2019s been a struggle and he hasn\u2019t lost as much/as fast as he wanted. He lost years not being as active as he could have been with his kids due to the weight. And his kids grew up sedentary eating high calorie crap. My bro is now better, but my  SIL and my 2 young nibblings are all overweight.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a popular idea to post about, but the more time people spend together, the more they tend to adopt the habits of others. \n\nI used to be married to someone who was slender, healthy, and in amazing physical shape. I am currently married to someone who is obese, less healthy, and lives a sedentary lifestyle. To some extent, I adopted the habits of each of my spouses. I was in much better shape when I was married to someone who wanted to go on bike rides and hikes with me. I struggle with my weight and health much more now that I\u2019m married to someone who has no interest in joining me for a bike ride after work and just wants to sit on the couch instead. Sure, I can do those things on my own, but it\u2019s not as fun. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re in no way shaming your GF, you making healthy choices is exposing her unhealthy choices. As a result, she\u2019s forced to confront that she could be making different choices and she isn\u2019t. The shame that she\u2019s feeling is real, but it\u2019s not your fault.", "It took me years to realize that my friends were the crabs in our bucket. Dumped them and moved on. Great analogy.", "NTA. Your GF is putting her guilt and insecurity off on you.  She knows she needs to lose weight but doesn't want to put the work in to lose it.  It's easier to complain about your behavior than for her to look in the mirror.", "NTA, red flags", "NTA.\n\nHere's the thing: there's an art to doing something like this successfully and you're missing it.  \n\nYou want to lose weight and get back in shape.  Awesome!  But you have to realize that the biggest part of the problem is that you said something to her about what you want.  Be quiet and let your results speak for themselves.  If she asks or confronts you, just say \"I'm working on my health.\"  If she says you're making her feel guilty, then respond \"You're an adult and can make your own choices.  I'm going to go for a walk.  You're welcome to join me if you wish.\"  Then leave and go for a walk.  DON'T ask her if she's coming.  Don't invite her anymore at all, don't announce your plans, just get your shoes on and go for a walk.  If she's interested at all she'll join you.  She may even start asking when you're going to go for a walk at some point.\n\nOn the junk: who does the shopping?  If it's you, then don't buy any more junk.  Let her make a trip to the store to get HER junk if she wants it.  If she does the shopping, let her buy whatever she likes.  If she offers some to you, just say \"No thanks.\"  Repeat as necessary, broken record style, until she leaves you alone.  If she gets angry and tries to pick a fight over it just say \"I can't figure out exactly why you're upset about me making choices to be healthier.  I'm gonna go for a walk right now.  If you want to talk about it when I come back, you might want to try a different approach.\"  Then leave.\n\nThe root of the problem is really that she's become comfortable with the two of you being overweight and out of shape.  If you start increasing your fitness levels and eating better, then she feels she needs to step up her game as well, because she knows that if you get back in shape you'll have other girls checking you out, and this worries her.  So rather than fix herself she wants to drag you down so that nobody else is interested in her man.  \n\nWhen you start making serious progress she will feel pressure to get up and start working on herself as well.  Her motivation to change her eating and fitness habits will come as a reaction to YOUR changes.  Because let's be honest: you love her, sure.  But let's say you lose 50 lbs. over the next year and she gains 50.  You may still love her, but will you be attracted to her like you are now?  \n\nBut you can't tell her this, she needs to \"just get it.\"  Lead by example and stop talking about it.", "Nta, and that must be draining dealing with all the negativity", "NTA your gf is insecure and needs to work on her own issues. This would drive me nuts.", "Unpopular opinion (now), but I think you're right. Nothing wrong with OP wanting to lose weight, but if they want to talk about it, there are other places\u2014sympathetic friends, r/loseit, weight loss app forums, etc. It's clear that it's a sensitive subject for OP's GF.\n\nAnd GF shouldn't be trying to stop OP's move to lose weight and become more active just because it makes her feel insecure or bad.\n\nOP might have more luck getting GF to join in *some* activities if they frame it in terms of *fitness*, not weight. Like OP, I've been less active while doing more work from home since Covid, so I consciously have to move more to stay fit (I used to get 5-6K steps just from normal workday activities at the university where I teach, sometimes more). My wife often joins me on walks and bike rides, because they're opportunities for us to talk about our day while also getting some exercise. Weight isn't itself the focus."]}
