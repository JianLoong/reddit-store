Causing him to stop?", "selftext": "context:  \nOP (me) F28  \nBoyfriend M24  \nMarko- Boyfriend's bio child 2yrs  \nPolo- boyfriend's ex's child (no relation to bf)  \nbaby moma- bf's ex. The mother of marko and polo.\n\nI (OP) and boyfriend have been seeing each other for only about 3 weeks, an admittedly short amount of time. \n\nThe issue arises however with Polo- or the mother's expectations involving this child.  \nPolo is baby moma's 1st son and belongs to a deadbeat who lives out of town and has never been in Polo's life.\n\nBoyfriend spent about 3 yrs IN Polo's life as a male adult figure while in a relationship with baby moma.  Since they've split-he only sees Polo if he happens to be with Marko.\n\nLast night, baby moma contacted boyfriend and just told him \"you're taking the boys tonight\" and this upset him. He said he struggles to care for two children on his own can't afford it.  Confused I asked \"I thought only Marko was yours?\"\n\nHe confirmed, only Marko was his but he feels responsible for Polo as he was involved in his life from a young age.\n\nWe discussed Polo's father and I expressed my distaste for fathers who don't step up for their own children. Saying something along the lines of \"why does his dad get no responsibility? He should be feeling this obligation, not you.\"\n\nBoyfriend then told Baby Moma he will take Marko absolutely no issue, but said he's no longer going to be held responsible for Polo.\n\nBaby Moma then basically said \"cool you're never seeing your son again\"; then made threats to call local child care organizations and has been blasting him on facebook calling him a deadbeat dad.\n\nI am a childless woman-I won't even begin to pretend I understand how complicated her situation must be. However I am childless because-I choose to be. Meaning I've never just been like \"oops I guess I'm pregnant\" and have always found it fairly easy to just-not get knocked up. So I have little sympathy for this next detail:\n\n\\- She's currently pregnant with a 3rd child from a 3rd baby daddy - and has no idea who it is. And FULLY EXPECTS BOYFRIEND TO CARE FOR THIS NEW 3RD CHILD!  \nOne conceived AFTER they broke up by another man!  \nIts clear to me that this woman will expect boyfriend to pay for and care for ANY child she has now or in the future because he's a good man. To her it has nothing to do with who was there for Polo or Marko its who will pay the child support.\n\nI feel like my comment was the final straw. I'm worried I should have kept my mouth shut.  \nBut I was genuinely just-making light conversation. I never said \"you should do xyz\"\n\nI also really hate that because he wouldn't take both children, he wasn't permitted to see HIS child.  \nAITA? Does everyone here suck?

He\u2019s not obligated. It may be worse in the long run because of the way his ex seems to depend on him. \n\nBut thinking purely from a children\u2019s well-being point of view, l feel bad for \u201cPolo\u201d seeing \u201cMarko\u201d get time with a dad that he might have considered a dad as well. I don\u2019t know the age of Polo so perhaps he\u2019s too young to have formed this attachment.

He may end up having to pay child support legally but it sounds like he's stepped up and been a good father so that shouldn't be an issue for him.

After 3 weeks of dating you really have no say. How does bf feel about being the stand in dad for Polo? It's his decision in the end. At the same time, maybe he needed to see from another perspective that if he continues he will be trapped forever in this child's life. And the subsequent lives of the kids Baby Moma produces. All in all a f'd up situation.", "NTA, it sounds like you just spoke to your BF and helped get him to a decision. I'm sure it wasn't the first time he had thoughts about Polo not being his. The ex sucks. The Polos real daddy sucks too. But you do have to understand that at some point your BF maybe saw them both as his boys. Sounds like your BF stepped up and brought that other boy into his life. \n\n\nI actually have a childhood friend in a similar situation with his ex and son. I don't know if he pays for the non bio son, but every trip or big outing, he always includes his sons brother. Buys both presents and takes them both on vacations. It's complicated, but at some point your child's sibling can become family. Props to your BF for being there as long as he did. Maybe there is a way for him to continue to be in Polos life.

He\u2019d been a father figure to the little boy for 3 years. \n\nWithdrawing financial support AND no longer seeing the boy who looked up to him as a dad so abruptly was an asshole move on your bf\u2019s part. If he wanted to step back, there were ways to do that more gradually or less confusingly to the poor kid. \n\nObviously, the mom is the worst. 3 kids by 3 baby daddies and expect 1 to support them all is crazy. She doesn\u2019t seem like a responsible woman.", ">I feel like my comment was the final straw\n\nYou've been dating 3 weeks and already reached the final straw? Why is this even an issue? Just stop seeing him. You're clearly not compatible.", "ESH\n- bio mom is using the children as pawns\n- you do sound kind of judgmental. Why are you so involved in a relationship of less than a month?\n- you boyfriend shouldn\u2019t have to be responsible for a child that\u2019s not his. But it\u2019s cruel to do a 180\u00b0 on them and be their father figure for 3yrs to completely bailing on them.\n\nDoes he pay child support now? Does he have a visitation plan set up?", "NTA\n\nI don't feel like at this point in your relationship what you say has that much sway on what your boyfriend does or does not do with his already established patterns. \n\nBut I do know a story from my state, which is a very pro-mom state. In which two kids were taken from their mother these children are half siblings and the youngest one's father didn't even know he was a dad. So the state tracks him down, he lived in a different state, do a DNA test and he gets custody of his kid. Ok, that's his right the state but he also said he would take the older kid as well to keep them together, the older kid's dad was not able to care for the child. The state said ok and he had to jump through some hoops but both kids now live healthy happy lives with their new dad. \n\nAlso because I've worked with children, BF needs to get a lawyer and establish paternity of his kid and get visitation rights, she cannot deny him access to his child unless he is a bad person. The sooner the better because I just have a bad feeling that these kids might be taken away from mom at some point. And I have nothing to support that, nothing you've said has made me think that, it's just an eerie feeling I have, that makes me think that. So he needs to be prepared for something like that.", "NTA, no idea why people are assuming that you put a gun on bf's head and told him to leave Polo. You simply asked out of curiosity and By the looks of it, your bf himself didn't want to financially contribute towards Polo but felt obligated as he was with his mom. It sucks for Polo, it would be nice for your bf to support him but not financially if he doesn't want or if he wants that too, either way NOT obligated. \n\nThe ex gf here is indeed very dumb, she's ruining her kid's lives by getting knocked up by just anyone and not sueing those males for child support. I too hate deadbeat males, wish their D fell off.", "ESH\n\nFirst, I understand your frustration.  I agree!  But its NOT your circus, not your monkeys.  You should not have any say in how he interacts with his SON and his son\u2019s brothers.  Blood relationship or not, he gets to choose for himself what he wants to do.\n\nHe sucks because he is letting his 3 week girlfriend influence what he does and doesnt do for kids that he has previously cared about.  He should be telling you to bugger off because you dont respect his autonomy here.\n\nIts only a 3 week relationship.  Whyyyy are any of you putting up with this stuff?  Just walk away from this mess.  You\u2019re literally talking about not having kids, while messing with a dude who comes with loads of baby momma drama and 1-3 kids.", "ESH, 3 weeks! If you don't like this situation now your really going to fucking hate in 3 months.", "ESH\n\nI get wanting Polo's dad to take responsability but denying Polo the opportunity to have a willing positive role model isn't the way to go. \n\nYour bf wants to be in his life and Polo seems like he is in dire need of a father figure who actually desires to step up. Taking him along on outings with his bio son is worlds different than just giving his mom money straight up. \n\nIn addition to taking away what might be the only male role model Polo has, you are also not allowing him to spend time with his *own brother*. You might not think of Polo as family because he lacks blood relation but he's still the brother of your bfs son.\n\nYes, the baby mama is insanely unreasonable to expect your bf to pay for a child who was concieved after their relationship ended and for calling the cops over something so frivolous. But that doesn't justify taking away the time Polo spends with family, blood or no blood.", "NTA Hes in a tough position thats for sure. Thats why i stay away from entering situations like this in the first place. He should really start keeping a paper trail of their convos. How good a mom can she be to 3 different kids demanding that he support them. \n\nIdk your future with this guy but if he has the means, its really up to him.
