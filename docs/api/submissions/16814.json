Causing him to stop?", "selftext": "context:  \nOP (me) F28  \nBoyfriend M24  \nMarko- Boyfriend's bio child 2yrs  \nPolo- boyfriend's ex's child (no relation to bf)  \nbaby moma- bf's ex. The mother of marko and polo.\n\nI (OP) and boyfriend have been seeing each other for only about 3 weeks, an admittedly short amount of time. \n\nThe issue arises however with Polo- or the mother's expectations involving this child.  \nPolo is baby moma's 1st son and belongs to a deadbeat who lives out of town and has never been in Polo's life.\n\nBoyfriend spent about 3 yrs IN Polo's life as a male adult figure while in a relationship with baby moma.  Since they've split-he only sees Polo if he happens to be with Marko.\n\nLast night, baby moma contacted boyfriend and just told him \"you're taking the boys tonight\" and this upset him. He said he struggles to care for two children on his own can't afford it.  Confused I asked \"I thought only Marko was yours?\"\n\nHe confirmed, only Marko was his but he feels responsible for Polo as he was involved in his life from a young age.\n\nWe discussed Polo's father and I expressed my distaste for fathers who don't step up for their own children. Saying something along the lines of \"why does his dad get no responsibility? He should be feeling this obligation, not you.\"\n\nBoyfriend then told Baby Moma he will take Marko absolutely no issue, but said he's no longer going to be held responsible for Polo.\n\nBaby Moma then basically said \"cool you're never seeing your son again\"; then made threats to call local child care organizations and has been blasting him on facebook calling him a deadbeat dad.\n\nI am a childless woman-I won't even begin to pretend I understand how complicated her situation must be. However I am childless because-I choose to be. Meaning I've never just been like \"oops I guess I'm pregnant\" and have always found it fairly easy to just-not get knocked up. So I have little sympathy for this next detail:\n\n\\- She's currently pregnant with a 3rd child from a 3rd baby daddy - and has no idea who it is. And FULLY EXPECTS BOYFRIEND TO CARE FOR THIS NEW 3RD CHILD!  \nOne conceived AFTER they broke up by another man!  \nIts clear to me that this woman will expect boyfriend to pay for and care for ANY child she has now or in the future because he's a good man. To her it has nothing to do with who was there for Polo or Marko its who will pay the child support.\n\nI feel like my comment was the final straw. I'm worried I should have kept my mouth shut.  \nBut I was genuinely just-making light conversation. I never said \"you should do xyz\"\n\nI also really hate that because he wouldn't take both children, he wasn't permitted to see HIS child.  \nAITA? Does everyone here suck?

He\u2019s not obligated.

He may end up having to pay child support legally but it sounds like he's stepped up and been a good father so that shouldn't be an issue for him.

After 3 weeks of dating you really have no say. How does bf feel about being the stand in dad for Polo? It's his decision in the end. At the same time, maybe he needed to see from another perspective that if he continues he will be trapped forever in this child's life. And the subsequent lives of the kids Baby Moma produces. All in all a f'd up situation.", "NTA, it sounds like you just spoke to your BF and helped get him to a decision. I'm sure it wasn't the first time he had thoughts about Polo not being his. The ex sucks. The Polos real daddy sucks too. But you do have to understand that at some point your BF maybe saw them both as his boys. Sounds like your BF stepped up and brought that other boy into his life. \n\n\nI actually have a childhood friend in a similar situation with his ex and son. I don't know if he pays for the non bio son, but every trip or big outing, he always includes his sons brother. Buys both presents and takes them both on vacations. It's complicated, but at some point your child's sibling can become family. Props to your BF for being there as long as he did. Maybe there is a way for him to continue to be in Polos life.

He\u2019d been a father figure to the little boy for 3 years. \n\nWithdrawing financial support AND no longer seeing the boy who looked up to him as a dad so abruptly was an asshole move on your bf\u2019s part. If he wanted to step back, there were ways to do that more gradually or less confusingly to the poor kid. \n\nObviously, the mom is the worst. 3 kids by 3 baby daddies and expect 1 to support them all is crazy.

Why is this even an issue? Just stop seeing him. You're clearly not compatible.", "ESH\n- bio mom is using the children as pawns\n- you do sound kind of judgmental. Why are you so involved in a relationship of less than a month?\n- you boyfriend shouldn\u2019t have to be responsible for a child that\u2019s not his. But it\u2019s cruel to do a 180\u00b0 on them and be their father figure for 3yrs to completely bailing on them.\n\nDoes he pay child support now? Does he have a visitation plan set up?", "NTA\n\nI don't feel like at this point in your relationship what you say has that much sway on what your boyfriend does or does not do with his already established patterns. \n\nBut I do know a story from my state, which is a very pro-mom state. In which two kids were taken from their mother these children are half siblings and the youngest one's father didn't even know he was a dad. So the state tracks him down, he lived in a different state, do a DNA test and he gets custody of his kid. Ok, that's his right the state but he also said he would take the older kid as well to keep them together, the older kid's dad was not able to care for the child. The state said ok and he had to jump through some hoops but both kids now live healthy happy lives with their new dad. \n\nAlso because I've worked with children, BF needs to get a lawyer and establish paternity of his kid and get visitation rights, she cannot deny him access to his child unless he is a bad person. The sooner the better because I just have a bad feeling that these kids might be taken away from mom at some point. And I have nothing to support that, nothing you've said has made me think that, it's just an eerie feeling I have, that makes me think that. So he needs to be prepared for something like that.", "NTA, no idea why people are assuming that you put a gun on bf's head and told him to leave Polo. You simply asked out of curiosity and By the looks of it, your bf himself didn't want to financially contribute towards Polo but felt obligated as he was with his mom. It sucks for Polo, it would be nice for your bf to support him but not financially if he doesn't want or if he wants that too, either way NOT obligated. \n\nThe ex gf here is indeed very dumb, she's ruining her kid's lives by getting knocked up by just anyone and not sueing those males for child support. I too hate deadbeat males, wish their D fell off.", "ESH\n\nFirst, I understand your frustration.  I agree!  But its NOT your circus, not your monkeys.  You should not have any say in how he interacts with his SON and his son\u2019s brothers.  Blood relationship or not, he gets to choose for himself what he wants to do.\n\nHe sucks because he is letting his 3 week girlfriend influence what he does and doesnt do for kids that he has previously cared about.  He should be telling you to bugger off because you dont respect his autonomy here.\n\nIts only a 3 week relationship.  Whyyyy are any of you putting up with this stuff?  Just walk away from this mess.  You\u2019re literally talking about not having kids, while messing with a dude who comes with loads of baby momma drama and 1-3 kids.", "ESH, 3 weeks! If you don't like this situation now your really going to fucking hate in 3 months.", "ESH\n\nI get wanting Polo's dad to take responsability but denying Polo the opportunity to have a willing positive role model isn't the way to go. \n\nYour bf wants to be in his life and Polo seems like he is in dire need of a father figure who actually desires to step up. Taking him along on outings with his bio son is worlds different than just giving his mom money straight up. \n\nIn addition to taking away what might be the only male role model Polo has, you are also not allowing him to spend time with his *own brother*. You might not think of Polo as family because he lacks blood relation but he's still the brother of your bfs son.\n\nYes, the baby mama is insanely unreasonable to expect your bf to pay for a child who was concieved after their relationship ended and for calling the cops over something so frivolous. But that doesn't justify taking away the time Polo spends with family, blood or no blood.", "NTA Hes in a tough position thats for sure. Thats why i stay away from entering situations like this in the first place. He should really start keeping a paper trail of their convos. How good a mom can she be to 3 different kids demanding that he support them. \n\nIdk your future with this guy but if he has the means, its really up to him.

I\u2019m 40 now and he\u2019s still my dad, the dad that would do anything for me, that would take a bullet for me and told me flat out no matter what he was my dad for life.  \n\nWhen I was in high school he was dating a woman with 2 kids of her own. She threw a fit when my dad bought me a used car for my 16th birthday and took me to get my license.  She had enough nerve to tell me that my dad wasn\u2019t my dad and I had no business even speaking to him ever again, that he didn\u2019t want me in his life.  Let me tell you that hurt like hell, still does.  My dad lost his shit and immediately ended the relationship because he refused to be with someone that dictated the relationship he can have with me.  \n\nYes biologically I am not his daughter but the day he came into my life was the day he decided he was going to be my dad and it\u2019s very possible your bf feels the same way about Polo.  You can\u2019t dictate how your bf feels about Polo and the relationship he wants to have with Polo.  \n\nMy cousin is in a similar situation.  Met a girl, turned out she was pregnant, got together, was there when the baby was born, stayed together until she was 5 or 6, as far as he\u2019s concerned that\u2019s his baby girl.  They break up, he moves out, ex calls him every time baby girl needs anything or she needs him to take her.  Hell he even pays child support for baby girl even though he isn\u2019t required to or legally obligated to, he just wants baby girl to have the best life possible.  He\u2019s her dad as far as both of them are concerned. Baby girl doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s not her bio dad.  \n\nMy dad and my cousin are both great dads and stand up men.  They aren\u2019t scared to stick around when shit gets hard.  You should be really proud of your bf for being like that, it\u2019s a sign of a great man and the type of man every woman wants in her corner, the type of man dads pray their daughters find and marry.  I would definitely recommend talking to your bf and say hey I realize I might have overstepped my boundaries and came across as offensive, I\u2019m not trying to keep you from having a relationship with Polo if that\u2019s what you want but I am concerned that your ex is taking advantage of you and I don\u2019t want to see that.

It can still be split custody, but it clearly needs to be court mandated. \n\nThat said, if your boy friend feels as though he\u2019s an important male influence in Polo\u2019s life, YTA for taking that away from both of them for the sake of it\u2019s technically not his kid and \u201cshould be\u201d the bio dad\u2019s responsibility.\n\nThat\u2019s taking it out on the kid. The truth is, your boy friend spent years with Polo as an importance influence and obviously your BF cares about and loves Polo, or else he wouldn\u2019t have continued to look after him.\n\nI get you have no relation to this kid, but your BF does, even tho it\u2019s not blood.\n\nHave you ever heard the term \u201cblended family\u201d? This is why they call it that. There are people intermixed in each others lives that aren\u2019t really family, but still are family.\n\nCutting that off for the sake of \u201cit\u2019s bio dad\u2019s responsibility\u201d makes you TA. That\u2019s not Polo\u2019s fault, and the fact of the matter is Dad is long gone, that\u2019s not an option.\n\nMoney is different than contact and support tho. BF should take baby mama to court for custody arrangement for Marko and child support for Polo if BF AND baby mama still wants BF to continue to have a relationship with Polo and take care of him, but can\u2019t afford to do so.\n\nUntil you\u2019re married to BF, this is, ethically (and legally), not your decision to make. If you don\u2019t want this to be your life, you should leave. Otherwise, ask your BF if, money aside, he\u2019d want to have Polo in his life still.\n\nIf yes, go to court for both boys. \n\nIf no, go to court for Marko.", "NTA but tell your BF he needs a family lawyer to establish custody.", "ESH except the babies, of course. \n\nOP: Three weeks. I doubt you\u2019ve even farted around this guy, but you see fit to comment negatively on what *appeared* to be fine until you said something.\n\nBF: Spineless, weak, impulsive. One word from you and he\u2019s willing to blow off a kid to whom, until you said something, he was more than willing to be a dad.\n\nBaby Mama: Do I really need to say anything?", "nta but man i feel sorry for the kid\u2026 to him your bf was his dad for 3 years.. it\u2019s a shame when parents parade men and women in and out of there lives because kids get hurt over and over again. but if he doesn\u2019t want to be dad i don\u2019t guess he has a reason to.", "It seems like he isn\u2019t just paying for the occasional night of baby sitting. He apparently pays some form of child support which with two kids can really be a burden on a guy who\u2019s only 24 and just starting out in life. \n\nAnd he knows she\u2019s about to introduce a third kid into the financial equation and for some reason expects him to support that one too. He is reasonably nervous about his future financial well-being.", "Why are you even getting involved with this guy.", "NTA, you literally only asked him a question. You\u2019re only in his life three weeks, if it was that easy to cut off a kid he was raising for three years, he was already fed up and that\u2019s not your fault. The ex is a MASSIVE a-hole, between her calling and just assuming he\u2019s taking the kids at the last minute and then using their child as a weapon, that\u2019s way out of line. I think your bf needs to get a lawyer ASAP, document what he\u2019s paid already in child support and then establish his rights and responsibilities.", "ESH\n\n- a gf of 3 weeks is easier to replace than a child the bf has known for 3 yrs. It's also too early to insert an opinion on someone's life. If OP doesn't know how to navigate dating someone with kid(s)/complicated co-parenting dynamics, then they should look for someone without these ties. \n\n- yes, the kids' mother should be more responsible and not take the ex-bf for granted.", "I'm confused.  What expense is involved in taking one vs two children for a night?  Maybe I misunderstood?  Regardless, BF needs to get his custody/support responsibilities in writing from the courts.  What he does for the children that are not his own, may well secure his place in heaven, but they're not required.  However his financial responsibilities & visitation with is own child should be set in stone.  JMHO  NTA", "Financially, your boyfriend has no obligation to Polo. On a logical level, he has no other obligations to Polo either. \n\nBut let's imagine being Polo for a minute. The only father figure you've ever had abruptly rejects you. What did you do wrong? Why doesn't your \"father\" want you anymore? You must have done something bad. Maybe you're ugly or stupid. Dad suddenly doesn't want you, you screwed it up somehow. \n\nThis will fuck this kid up for the rest of his life. I hope you and your boyfriend continue to treat Polo as though he's your boyfriend's son on an emotional level. Your boyfriend shouldn't pay any child support for Polo but you both should do right by him by continuing to love him. \n\nAs far as the new baby is concerned, baby momma is on her own. Your boyfriend has no previous relationship with this new baby so they won't be harmed like Polo will be. Refuse to care for new baby, but please, please don't take away Polo's only father figure. Please be good humans.", "NTA.\n\nBaby momma in unhinged and entitled.\n\nThis whole situation with Baby momma will drag on for 18 years. And your BF is a father, so you'll have his kid around, you need to decide if you're ready to be steo-mommy or not to this whole mess of a situation.", "three weeks in and it's already like this, girl, run!! You say you want to be a step mom cs you don't want to give birth... yea, there are still plenty of men out there with kids and healthy baby-mom relationships.", "NTA. Your BF can get some form of court mandated custody so he'll be able to see his kid. The rest are of no concern.", "These poor kids omg.", "ETA because what happens to Polo now?  He has a \u201cfather\u201d/\u201cfather figure\u201d who just dips because he\u2019s broken up with the mom??  That really sucks for the kids.  Irresponsible people are one thing; people being irresponsible about kids is another.", "NTA. \n\nHowever, kudos to your BF for caring for both kids. Marko and Polo are siblings so it\u2019s nice for them to be cared for together. They are in for a rough ride in life based on what you\u2019ve said of mom. It would be nice for them to have a good male role model in their lives. However, holding him financially responsible seems a bridge too far for me unless he\u2019s independently wealthy or something but I\u2019m guess this is not the case. But, if he can take care of both of them rather than only his bio child from time to time when bio mom needs a break?? That\u2019s a positive to his child so if he can swing it, I\u2019d support him doing it. Good daddy, happy child. Happy sibling of child.", "NTA - maybe Polo's father doesn't know the kid even exists or she has banned him from seeing the kid. Talk to your partner about going to court.", "BF needs to go to court either for sole custody of Marco, or visitation rights specified by the court. You need to think about your ability to handle this circus.", "Your bf needs to lawyer up and get a custody and child support agreement. \n\nNTA", "This is why dating someone with kids is a gigantic no for me. It's not fair to the kid no matter what you do. Nope. \n\nYou aren't wrong though.", "Everyone is an asshole, even the unborn child.", "GO TO COURT!\n\nAdmittedly I am assuming you're in the US or courts are similar where you are. BF needs to go to family division TOMORROW and file for custody! Just let her try to not let him see his son one he has a court order and her dumb ass will be in jail! lol A court will NEVER ask him to pay support on these other kids! He might even get full custody if she isn't fit...who knows, but a court order will cut out 80% of her bullshit! NTA and you're completely correct!", "Nta\n\nBut your boyfriend needs to keep communications mainly over text and needs to document every time he is denied access to his child. He also needs to file for custody with the court ASAP. Maybe not for full custody, but there needs to be a custody order in place signed by a judge to ensure he gets his parenting time. She needs to be held accountable for denying her son his father.\n\nWhen he does this, it'll open the door for her to collect child support, which can be a good thing because he will only have to pay support for HIS child. \n\nAs a mom, I dont see how anyone can keep their kid away from their father without reason. My son just turned 2 and knows what's going on. All he talks about all day are mommy and daddy because we are his whole world. If his dad is even 5 min late from work, he's asking, \"Where's daddy?\" I couldn't break my sons heart like that.", "Nta. He should get a custody agreement with a court. He\u2019s only responsible for his kid.", "Anyone who is using the term \"baby momma\" on Reddit needs to rethink their relationship choices.", "There are laws about step parents being responsible for their step-children in some places. \n\nI am not saying this is OP\u2019a boyfriends situation, but there are laws in some places where this exists. BF might very well have a financial obligation, we don\u2019t know that. \n\nBut a lawyer would. And contacting a lawyer about this is exactly what boyfriend should be doing to sort custody and child support.", "Amen...", "Her bf is actually taking care of his kid (which only one of them is his), the other two kids have deadbeats fathers, Ops bf is not a deadbeat and I don't get why he should be accountable of anything?", "They- man, where do I begin. Oh, *they are using FAKE names!*. That\u2019s where.", "No the next guy his ex dates will fill that role of a father figure. This guy ended the relationship which ends the relationship with any step kids. His ex is obviously just trying to use him as a free babysitter.", "Single dads don\u2019t all have drama. This sounds like\u2026 a lot", "If you do that woman and her drama will be a part of the next 16 years of your life.  At *minimum*.", "Girl- adopt. Or find a widower. I love kids, I have some of my own-  but I've also dealt with baby mama drama and it's the WORST.", "We are just idiots on the internet with the smallest view of your life but I feel like this needs to be repeated.\n\nThere are other men. There is adoption. The sooner you leave the better.\n\nI know a lot of women who have stuck it out in very similar situations and it just ends up as a dumpster fire.", "This is a lot for just 3 weeks of dating. I would suggest slowing it down a bit.", "Then find a man who has a child and is smart enough to have a custody arrangement with his ex regarding his child and also has the maturity not to take his crazy exs rands seriously. All of this could be solved by a lawyer and some boundaries - things that your BF should have established LONG before you showed up to prompt him. It\u2019s not a cute look on him.", "[deleted]", "Have you considered adoption? It's miles better than single-parent drama. And your boyfriend's drama is even worse than regular single parent drama tbh.", "My advise: be careful who you give your heart to. If you break up with bf you'll also break up with the kid. Been there, done that, no fun.", "This happies me to hear for some reason.", "YOU'VE BEEN DATING FOR THREE WEEKS!!!! WTF... \n\nWhat is wrong with you? \n\n1) The child already has a mother, you will never be that child's mother. \n2) And I reiterate WTF, it's been three weeks.... How irresponsible are you to say you'd consider being the mother to a boyfriend's child after three weeks...", "You have to understand that your bf at one point stepped up. The courts take all of that into account if she or him goes to court you\u2019ve fucked him over. Big time. No doubt there\u2019s proof that he\u2019s stepped up and has been a financial contributor to this child\u2019s life. That in many states makes him responsible for that child. No court that sees he\u2019s taken the responsibility and bonded with the kid will side with him.", "Honestly, THAT would be the deal breaker for me. He needs to take the initiative to *guarantee* his position in his kid\u2019s life, be aware of and prepared to act on situations that aren\u2019t safe, and providing the full amount of child support under the law. \n\nHe is just as irresponsible as baby mama. He knew who she was and what she was about, and he knocked her up anyhow. And also knowing how she was, he\u2019s let her hold all the cards over when and if and how he can see his son. No, this is not the prize you think he is. The truth is, he took the easy way out, at the expense of his relationship with his kid. And you shouldn\u2019t have to teach a near 30 year old man how to be an involved parent.", "This. I\u2019m a stepmom myself and my stepson is a dream. His mom though has given me nothing but pain and grief. Think hard before committing to this relationship. Also NTA. But I don\u2019t think you meant that your BF should cut off seeing his son\u2019s half brother but rather that he shouldn\u2019t necessarily be financially responsible. Your BF needs to get a court order too to protect his rights.", "Be realistic he\u2019s never getting sole custody of that kid. It\u2019s more possible for him getting stuck legally paying child support for the eldest considering he\u2019s bonded and taken the financial responsibility of raising him. Courts see that and don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a bio dad or not as long as kid has stability.", "Took the words right outta my mouth", "I wouldn't fault OP's boyfriend for not wanting to take care of both kids. His care for Polo as a *former* step-parent is him being a saint, and his care for Marko as a parent is him being responsible.\n\nAnd it's clear that he's struggling, so he must prioritize his own child. OP didn't dissuade him as much as reminded him. He wasn't too thrilled when his ex asked him to take both kids.", "If by \u201ccool your jets\u201d you mean run, yes, RUN. This dude got taken in so easily, also never got legal matters settled when the kid was born- he\u2019s going to be a whole mess for you in so many ways!", "Lol maybe not dumb, just a young and impressionable doormat. Im older than him and I am far from mature enough to have a kid, let alone deal with three kids of which only one is actually mine. \n\nWhat a nightmare for him though. The gf is seemingly just going to keep adding kids to his tab. He needs some legal protection yesterday.", "Yea three weeks is like a few dates max. They\u2019ve gone to dinner once or twice and maybe slept together a couple times. My most recent gf I dated for 4 months and never even saw her apartment. \nOP just doesn\u2019t know the guy or his situation well enough to be offering advice.", "I disagree, in fact I would've liked to talk about important matters like before starting dating tbh. If op and her bf felt it was ok to talk about this after dating for three weeks then it's fine to them.", "This is how my daughter\u2019s dad and I coparent and it\u2019s honestly truly the best thing, for everyone. I know that sometimes not all parties are even capable of behaving this way and we talk often about how thankful we are for having what we have. I wish it could be this way for all kids who have parents in multiple houses.", "Absolutely agree, but it's clear the child's mother is erratic and irresponsible. It's best the BF plays nice until things are settled in court.", "Right?? And not just men either! I see a lot women commenting similarly. It\u2019s like damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t around here.", "Seems baby moma was stupid enough to text/post most of that BS so hope he got screen shots.", "I hadn't even considered that! There are so many layers of complexity already and the relationship is only 3 weeks old.\n\nYeesh"]}
