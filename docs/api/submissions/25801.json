There are kinder ways to tell someone that something might not be very flattering on their body type, especially considering she didn\u2019t ask your opinion. You could have just said no. If you wanted to be supportive you could suggest shopping for new clothes together or something and help make recommendations if she was interested.", "Honestly slight YTA. 6months is not a long time to gain that drastic of weight. She probably has a hard time truly adjusting. Her mind is used to her being skinny way more than her being bigger.
