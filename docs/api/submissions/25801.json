I literally changed nothing in my routine, and I worked a pretty laborious job where I was lifting heavy things in the heat all day. Unless somebody was feeding me in my sleep I don\u2019t understand why I went from rail thin to a bloated corpse if it wasn\u2019t my metabolism", "Why does that matter so much to you though? It gives disordered calorie counting.", "Fair enough", "Omg! Me too! I just bought the BEST pants the other day. They are tan, considered denim, but are soooo super soft and \u201cdrapey\u201d if you can imagine that. So so soft to touch and feel on my legs.

Did you go to a doctor to get yourself checked? \n\nAnd I know it sounds fuck-up but my best friend she sleepwalks at night and eat like a pig, obvie only ask the snacks, carrots wasn't her go to. She did it for years while dieting and didn't understand why didn't lose weight. Her husband found out by accident one night. He had to rearrange all the food so she didn't know where the snacks are. \nI'm not saying you do this.", "I'm sorry but don't understand your comment..... what matters do much to me?
