What does this mean for her to style herself in this way?\n\nSide note: It is however valid to talk to her about appropriate clothing for certain events which you will mutually attend.

I\u2019m gonna go with op as the AH for having absolutely no tact.", "Omg, when I was your age I had a late puberty too and suddenly had a huge growth spurt! I went from 5'2\" to 5'7\" and stayed the same weight, but even then I obviously couldn't wear my old sizes because my frame was legitimately too big because of my growth spurt! I also got more curves as well haha! Like, I've accepted that even at the thinnest I can be, it's impossible for me to fit into my old sizes because my height and frame was just so different. I cannot imagine forcing yourself into too small clothing \u2014 it's so uncomfortable \ud83d\ude23", "It matters so much because you brought in inaccurate information. We are literally going through an obesity epidemic, and it's faulty info like this that is responsible for it. When people in their twenties are blaming their metabolisms, then we have a problem because that's just not how any of it works. Twenties is still young. Your metabolism should not be tanking like that. Even so, metabolic changes account for such a small amount off your BMR during older age that literally ten minutes of activity offsets it\n\nAlso, disordered calorie counting? What are you even talking about? Watching your weight and understanding the science behind it is not disordered. Again, this hysteria about everything being a symptom of a restrictive ED is not helping when over 70 percent of our population is overweight or obese. Only 1 percent have anorexia.\n\nI worked in healthcare and I literally have a permanently injured back and knees. I have seen what it does to people, and if I had a dollar for every time someone said it was their metabolism only for them to lose weight in the hospital when we put them on a small deficit (not even a big one, we just made sure they ate 2000 calories not 3000) I would be rich. 99 percent of the time it is eating. \n\nI understand weight is a sensitive topic, but educating people on how calories work is not promoting an ED for God's sake.", "Im currently breastfeeding, which means I burn an \u201cextra\u201d 500 calories per day. Im also ravenous, so my friend got me some little individual packs of trail mix to have something to snack on. 180 calories/ serving, not too bad! Somehow Im not losing weight though.. \n\nBut then I realized, each little package is actually 2 servings. So that\u2019s 360 calories. Add in an extra coffee every day because Im also exhausted, that brings me to at least 500 calories. Plus, okay, honestly, sometimes I was eating 2 packs of the trail mix which was 720 calories! Barely even noticing it.", "Yup. Definitely NTA. Two important things I realized as a fellow juicy gal:\n\n1. No one can see the tag on my clothes except for me\n\n2. I look so much sexier in clothes that fit", "Agreed. Clothes that fit always look better than clothes several sizes too small, and too-small clothing can actually cause health issues as well (pinched nerves and skin chafing, being some primary ones). \n\nOP is NTA for wanting her friend to dress in clothing that fits correctly, nor for pointing out that significantly poorly-fitting clothing looks ridiculous. She might suggest to her friend some options for larger clothing in the style she\u2019s after.", "Agree! Also if she doesn\u2019t like the size written in the label of clothes that fit her, she could remove the label and pretend the clothes are a smaller size if that makes her happy. Or she could buy from designers who use \u201cvanity sizing,\u201d so people who wear size 12 can get clothes marked size 10. \n\nWhy look ridiculous and uncomfortable when you can get clothes that fit?", "Saying they would look ridiculous is", "Whatever this new fad is that has large, extra large, and super large women walking around in tube tops and booty/bike shorts with their extra-ness squashing out hither and thither needs to go away.  I'm not sure what happened to make anyone think that small and ill-fitting sportswear are a good choice for big gals, but it's awful in every way.", "It doesn't even only make you feel better, you look better too in clothes that fit. Fitting clothes can make you look slimmer than clothes that are too small..\n\nIt's so important to buy clothes that fit you and make you feel good.", "> so I don't want my smaller clothes to be damaged\n\nThat doesn't really sound nice, does it. Sounds like: You're so fat you will destroy these clothes. A lot worth than what OP said IMO.", "You\u2019re gaining weight too so you\u2019re not being judgmental. She\u2019s going to have a wardrobe malfunction eventually and it\u2019s gonna be a real problem. Plus I don\u2019t understand how she\u2019s even comfortable.", "Hijacking this to say that 160 pounds body weight is not fat it's curvy (a healthy and less curvy 5' 2\" woman should probably be 125 to 135 pounds or so, depending on the individual). Maybe suggest to your friend that dressing curvy instead of stick figure might be a better fit/photogenic for her Instagram (I assume she does Instagram).", "Don't know why she is saying nothing changed now. That is a big change! Good for her for quitting smoking though.", "My best friend has been all different sizes, and she always dresses the same way. When she was heavy, I\u2019ll never forget she had on this lime green and hot pink floral tutu short dress on that didn\u2019t zip in the back, so she tucked it into her too tight bra, and yes it was that loud and gaudy. She had pink spike heels on. We were walking past a big window and she stops dead in her tracks and turns around and says, who the hell do I think I am. It was so frigging funny. We laughed so hard. She is so extroverted and is who she is, I love her for it. If she feels good in her outfit, I feel good for her. She knows her clothes are outrageous sometimes and owns it, full of confidence", "Two pairs of spanx, high waisted jeans, and a whole lot of pain is my guess.", "Having a lusting partner is such a good cure for body image issues. I\u2019m up 30 lbs and feeling unattractive, and then he asks me to striptease for him a little before bed and gets all turned on and I feel so much better about my new size.", "At the same time and the same amount ? Yeah right", "5\u20191 and 135. I\u2019m used to 105. I hate my boobs, only when I was 100 were they okay. I have sensory issue too and hate when they are heavy enough not be perky because they touch my chest i hateeee it! I don\u2019t wear bras much either usually a baggy sweatshirt is okay enough ish. Good on you for getting a reduction, I absolutely would if I could.", "Same for mine...she wasn't ever that overweight, but her clothes were obviously struggling. Thankfully after dropping 200 pounds [alchoholic boyfriend. Heehee] and started acting like herself again she got back to her original weight! ^^\n\n\nIt's better to address your issues than ignore them. Works better for everyone in the long run.", "I have to do a fashion show every time I buy new underwear!!! Naturally, of course, he has to check to make sure the fit is just right. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Exactly this. I started long distance running a few years back. I was training for a half marathon, so I figured I could eat whatever I wanted. Fast forward eight months into training, and I feel slowed down and sluggish and my clothes were getting tight. I decided to weigh myself since I hadn't during that 8 month period. I had GAINED 40 lbs. \n\nI thought I was going crazy because I thought there was just no way since I ran 25-30 miles a week. Lol, I was wrong. I would come home from runs, get a ravenous appetite, and binge. I didn't count my calories, so I didn't know how much I was eating. I swore up and down I was barely eating. I was tempted to blame it on conditions or genetics, but then I remembered that those things are super rare and often just what people who are delusional tell themselves. \n\nAnyways, I started a food diary. Found out real fast that I was eating over 3000 calories a day. No fucking wonder I gained so quickly, even with the running, that was still a huge caloric surplus. \n\nYou cannot outrun the fork. I've lost 40 lbs since then, and I now run faster and keep track of my calories.", "That\u2019s not really how it works. It\u2019s an extremely common misconception though. People\u2019s behavior changes when they hit mid twenties and they blame getting fat on metabolism because they don\u2019t realize how much they\u2019ve changed.\n\n\nIt *definitely* doesn\u2019t change that rapidly in a couple of months.", "I'm looking to eventually run a marathon. Have my first 10km run next month. Any tips?", "Yep! But then my pants will stay up even if they\u2019re too big UNLESS I put anything in the pockets \ud83d\ude02", "They are to us short-waisted ppl", "I'm short with a really short torso. Low-rise jeans are perfect for me. I'm with you on this!", "Lol that makes sense, i have the longest torso known to man \ud83d\ude02.
