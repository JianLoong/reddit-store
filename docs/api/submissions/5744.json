If your wife is waking up to feed your baby, then her sleep is shattered and she needs more of it.  Even if you're doing half the night feedings, she is still healing from childbirth, which is exhausting.  If she's breastfeeding, again, that's exhausting.\n\nIf you are sabotaging her ability to sleep when you could be helping care for your baby so she can recover some sleep... Then this goes from YTA to she should ask her parents to let her move in with them until you regain your sanity.\n\nIf you do not let her get some sleep when she can get it, she will be too tired to take care of your baby.

Such an AH.", "\u201cShe says\u201d so you don\u2019t do anything with the baby at night\u2026 she\u2019s doing it all\n\nlet her sleep I get you work, but I was working 8am-10pm coming home letting my wife sleep from 10:30-2:30, I was then sleeping from 2:30-7\u2026. No matter how long or hard or stressful YOUR day was\u2026 hers was 10x that\n\nCan I ask how old the 2 of you\u2019s are?", "And then you wake her up at 6 or 7? What? So she can sleep from 2 to 3 then 5 to 6? I wasn\u2019t going to post but YTA. If you are home let her sleep. So 2 May three hours of sleep while you sleep from 10:30 to 6 am. I thought you guys were just different sleep cycles. She\u2019s not getting any sleep. When she is a sleep it\u2019s probably only half way because it don\u2019t sound as if you help at night at all. Take a week off and have her wake you up every time she has to be up and sleep only when she sleeps.", "Are you kidding me? The baby is up for 3.5 hours between 12:30 and 5 (so one hour of sleep in that time period) and you are waking her up an hour or two after that? I\u2019d be livid", "\"She says...\" aaaand this right here tells me that you have absolutely no clue when it comes to caring for a newborn. They have to be fed every couple of hours, around the clock, during the first few weeks of life. Were you involved at ALL during her pregnancy because that's supposed to be common knowledge. You sound like a massive control freak and an insensitive, out-of-touch jerk. I hope your wife has family or friends nearby because it's crystal clear that you are incapable of offering anything resembling support to your poor wife. You're also a massive AH of the highest order.\nYTA \ud83d\udcaf", "How do you not even know when the baby is up? Why are you not helping at all?", "Clearly you . . . . .\n\n1. Don\u2019t and haven\u2019t been support[ing] your wife and child through the sleepless nights that follow birth.\n\n2. Don\u2019t support your wife through post-partum hormone fluctuations that also cause extreme exhaustion, depression, and many other mental and physical health problems.\n\n3. Don\u2019t do even half as much parenting as you should be, given that you\u2019re more worried about what your wife is or isn\u2019t doing than how you can HELP HER not only to raise your infant, but also to heal from the delivery of them. You clearly have forgotten that SHE IS STILL HEALING FROM BIRTH. Healing requires sleep. Healing requires HELP. \n\n\nYou need a serious wake up call my dude. You are failing as a father and as a partner by leaving this all to her and then doubling down by blaming her for not doing even MORE. Read a book or two and STEP UP. Goddamn.", "I hope she starts waking you up now when the baby wakes up. Such a disappointment when parents act like only one is responsible for child care.", "Newborns are supposed to wake up and eat every two hours AH", "So you\u2019re allowing her ONE HOUR of sleep before you think she should wake up? When do YOU take care of your son????", "Preach. My youngest slept a ton. My eldest never did. I hallucinated from lack of sleep.\n\nHappy Cake Day!", "Because it's all about him and she needs to never sleep while taking care of a 1 month old.", "With this large and mighty chorus of \u201cYTA\u201d on here, he will probably just stop commenting.", "And she gave birth a month ago! She may still be bleeding!!!", "I\u2019m waiting for the deleted account"]}
