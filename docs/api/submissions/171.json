{"id": 171, "submission_id": "yigzkz", "title": "AITA for wanting to go through insurance?", "selftext": " My car was hit by my boyfriend's parents' neighbor. It happened when my bf and I were out at dinner so when they hit my car, the neighbor told my bf's parents and shared information with them. We got back later, around 10 p.m. and that's when I found out. I did not talk to the neighbors because they were not home when we got back. I was parked on the street and they backed out of their driveway and hit my car. I need a whole new door panel on my front drivers' side door.\n\nI was obviously upset when they told me, but my dad, my sister and I all work in insurance so I know exactly what to do in this situation. When his parents told me about the accident, they said \"but there's no need to go through insurance because we know they are good for it.\"\n\nI expressed to them that my father would most likely file a claim. They then proceeded to say how it wasn't at all necessary.\n\nI called my dad and told him what happened. I am still on his insurance and the car is in his name, so it really is his claim to make. I told this to my bf's parents and they said \"well at least call them and try to work something out without going through insurance.\"\n\nI felt very pressured and like I was doing something wrong for wanting to go through my insurance company. \n\nI have had boundary and manipulation issues with his mother before and this felt exactly like that. I understand that they know their neighbors well and have lived by them for 20+ years, but that doesn't mean I should have to negotiate costs with them and not be able to get a rental car while mine is getting fixed.\n\nRight now, in the insurance world, it is taking much longer for cars to get fixed because supply chain issues and labor are much more expensive. I don't want to be stuck without a car for a week.\n\nAbout an hour after I got home I received a very long text from my bf about how the neighbors are good for the cost and how he would really appreciate it if we didn't go through insurance. I could tell his parents were influencing this and so I called him and told him to \"grow a pair and be on my side.\"\n\nHis mom then proceeded to forward me a text from their neighbor and ask me again to not talk to my insurance company. This was when I started to get really upset and I didn't really want to see them for a while. It feels like they care more about their relationship with their neighbor than they do about their relationship with me.\n\nSomehow I am now the bad guy to his family because their neighbor hit a bright red parked car. Unless it jumped out and scared them, I don't see how this is anyone's fault but theirs. Actions have consequences and this, to me, is the exact reason why people have insurance.\n\nWORST PART is that I had a conversation with them when I parked on the street. I went over and played with their dogs. They saw me park and knew I was there.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting to still go through insurance?", "created_utc": 1667234075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yigzkz/aita_for_wanting_to_go_through_insurance/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he can\u2019t back you up against his parents on such a clear cut issue and his backing you up has been a problem in the past, you need to have a serious sit down and let him know that he is going to have to step up on that front moving forward, that the two of you need to be a united front on the same page instead of him waffling in front of his mother. That type of thing can break a relationship.", "Its not their car. So, they don't get a vote. (If they at least gave you the money to repair the car upfront, I could see them getting involved. But, they haven't. So, WTH?)\n\nNTA. And stop explaining. They heard you. They are trying to manage the damage control - not listening to your needs.\n\nMy neighbor didn't file a claim when some teenager (drunk,) flew over the curb on our street and slammed into a tree my neighbor's dad planted when neighbor was just a boy. Neighbor owns the home he grew up in where his mom raised all her kids alone because her husband died a young man. The home, the space, everything is representative of how they all bootstrapped and stayed together and lived a good and happy life, even with the tragedy.\n\nNeighbor wanted to be a good guy and so he didn't call the police or file a claim. He called the girl's parents and they agreed to restore the damages. (I'm grateful she ran into that old tree. She'd have run straight into a bedroom in my house if there hadn't been any obstruction stopping her momentum.)\n\nWhen the parents found out that tree would cost about $4,000 to replace, they disappeared. Its never been righted.\n\nSo, I don't blame you for filing a claim. That's what insurance is for. And since your dad and sister work in the industry, I'd let them handle this one. Your BF's parents don't have to file a claim the next time someone smashes into their danged car, OK?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust file your claim. No need to cater to this fishy behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Sorry, too late, the claim is already field\" ... is the best answer here.", "NTA. Insurance can deal your dad's call. Sorry if it cost a boyfriend.", "NTA\n\n\nGo through insurance.  Repair places are so backed up and everything to do with cars is fucked right now.  Let insurance deal with all of that stuff.\n\n\n\nYour boyfriend's parent's neighbor should drive better if he doesn't want to deal with these kinds of things.", "NTA.  You have every right to file an insurance claim and from what it sounds like your car is not currently driveable, so you should do so now so you can get a rental car right away.\n\nYour boyfriends parents need to butt out as this has nothing to do with them.  If you want to, send them a simple \u201csince your vehicle was not involved in this accident, I\u2019ll be discussing the details only with my dad who is the owner.  Thanks\u201d. And ignore any other texts they send related to this issue.\n\nThe *only* time I would ever consider agreeing to let someone pay me cash is if the damage was extremely minor, surface damage, and less than $500, because financially it makes sense for that person to pay you rather than having the claim on their insurance when it\u2019s likely less than their deductible and could raise their annual costs.  BUT, you are still well within your rights (and morals) to still file a claim for even minor damage if that\u2019s what you feel most comfortable doing.", "NTA Also funny if nobody would go though insurance, would you, your sister and your dad even have jobs? They could cut down so many positions. \nAnd this pressure just that their neighbor save some bucks. And you have the hassle and get less. And it looks so great if you don't even go through insurance when your whole family works their. \n\nSince this is not the first time they pressure you, i would rethink the relationship. This will be your future. And they give a shit that you are the gf. You bf also has no backbone.", "NTA.  If they think the neighbors are going to resent them, all they have to do is make you the villain like they obviously plan on doing anyway.", "NTA. This is why we have insurance. It would be foolish **not** to submit a claim. I suspect someone has an expired license or tags or too many accidents on his record. None of which is your problem.", "YTA", "INFO: But you do know why they don't want the insurance company involved do you???", "NTA  By the time you wrote this could they have already paid you?", "NTA. As a person who also works in insurance, it is your duty to report an accident. In some states if the damage exceeds $1,000 you could face repercussions.", "thank you. i was about to say the same thing that she needs to tell them to mind their own business. They chimed in their unsolicited opinion and can drop it now.\n\nNTA", "I was thinking the neighbor might have a job that involves driving and requires a clean record.\n\nInsurance would require a police report be filed and that would end up showing the next time their employer did a check up.\n\nI also feel like both the BF and his family are totally disrespecting OP and her family.

Its wrong of BF's parents to try and act as mediators. This is so ridiculous to me. Not your business. Stay out of it. The car owner is going to do whatever they think best. And they should.

But thats not OPs problem to worry about, they hit her car, there are consequences. And I can't trust someone's word to do the right thing, especially someone OP doesn't know well at all.", "I have not talked to them because they weren't home when I got there and I left them a voicemail yesterday and still have not heard back.\n\nI understand being worried about premiums, but recently my sister hit a parked car and my parents were worried about the cost of her insurance but it only went up about $50. not anywhere near paying the around $1000 this would take ot fix", "I have no idea! Right when my bfs parents told me they said \"but there is no need to go through insurance.\" \n\nMy theory is that when they talked to the neighbors first, they promised that they wouldn't get a claim on their insurance or something. Maybe them trying to cover for an empty promise?", "we have not gotten into a shop to get anything quoted to see how much damages would be. it is still drivable and no body shops were open yesterday to get it in. so still in the waiting process. internal structure of the door seems to be damaged so damages could be anywhere from $200 - $1500 before the paint match. lot of money to just guess how much they should pay", "Written records aren't bad, but I am not proposing a contract.  $5000 cash in hand (or whatever's quoted amount is) or it gets reported.", "OK so when you have even a tiny of of accident, you pay hundreds dollars more for years. I had three incidents, very small stuff. It was 5 years ago. I am still paying hundreds of dollars more. Car insurance became more expensive than my car. I was unemployed, and I spent a lot of money on car insurance for a car that I didn't drive. \n\n\n\nIf only I was smarter back then. My first experience was that cracked someone's bumper and he said if you want we can meet at your mechanic and you can pay for it. Insurance maybe expensive for you he said and I  thought \"what does he even mean? Weird. I'm not gonna pay it. Insurance will\"\n\n I sad let's go with insurance with all my pride. It was my fault. F*CK me. I wish I knew he was doing me a favor. \n\n\n\nIs it a hassle to deal with this stuff in person? Maybe. Reddit kids are all about it's not my problem. \n\nWhat people don't know, there is no way they can get away without paying you. Yes, it would be a hassle, you'd go to the small court, which is actually a friggin easy process. It is over in 30 minutes for something like this. (I have that experience too) \n\n\nAlso, even if you agreed verbally, you send them an email a letter or just text and say here's what we discussed. They say yes and it's applicable by law. They ignore it? It is still applicable because by not replying they are agreeing with it. You don't even need to talk to them ever again. These are the worst case scenarios. You have witnesses, you know where they live. \n\nI understand that it's up to your dad since he is the insurance holder. My advice would be do them a solid in this situation. But get an estimate of the cost, ask them to pay for a rental car upfront.\n\n\nOf course I am biased. I can feel their pain. Who knows what's going on with them. They can be evil, whatever. As long as you take the money upfront, tell the mechanic to charge them or something you will be fine.\n\n\nEdit: missing words", "Write a demand letter.", "Bad idea to do it outside of an insurance claim, as quotes are just that, quotes. If it ends up being more, you will be on the hook whereas if you go the insurance route, you will be made whole regardless of cost overruns."]}
