Growing up, my parents always hated when I slept in, but I thought it was what parents tell their teenagers. It still hurt my feelings when they complain about it though, as it made me feel lazy. \n\nI moved out a 23 to live with my fiance (25M). Thing is, he also naggs me about liking to sleep. I told him multiple times that it hurts my feelings as it makes me feel lazy, and that it the easiest way to piss me off. \n\nWe have a kid, and if the kid wakes up, I get up and take care of it. I cook dinner from scratch 5+ times a week, the other nights it either frozen meal or we eat out. Laundry is done, folded and put away and 90% of the time, my fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have to touch any laundry. Home is decently clean, my bills are paid, he had lunch for work. I cut and peel fruits/veggies so he has healthy snacks to eat. When I\u2019m working (currently on maternity leave), I get up and am never late. I know I could do more around the house, anyone could always \u201cdo more\u201d. \n\nLast week, he commented in front of my parents that I had slept in. When we got home, I reminded him that these comments hurt my feelings and ask him why it bothers him so much that I sleep in when I can. He couldn\u2019t give me a clear answer, simply saying that I could achieve more. His answer makes me feel even more like a lazy a** and a failure, as I feel like I am happy with what I\u2019m achieving. But I am starting to wonder if I am really the problem for liking sleep, as I had comments on this for the pas 15 years, from my parents and now my s/o. \n\nSo, AITA for liking to sleep and getting mad at those comments?\n\nEDIT: To clarify and answer a few of you\n- I don\u2019t nap during the day, unless sick, wich is rare. \n\n- I get up when my kid gets up. If it\u2019s at 5 am, I only slept 5-6 hours, but I still get up. If he gets up at 10am, I get up at that time. \n\n- If I have nothing to wake me up or reasons to be up (work, kid, appointments, family stuff, chores, etc) I can sleep until noon. I can understand at some point my parents when living there, as I could sleep 12h most days of the week. But I had a full time job when I moved in with my s/o so I only slept in on vacation days and weekends when we had nothing planned. I usually work 5days/week. \n\n- We do spend time together. We have 1-2 dates a month without the kid, and a few family gathering/dates with the kid. We eat dinner at the table every night, play video games together, cuddle, watch movies, etc. \n\n- I have never missed any plans or gathering because I was sleeping. Again, except for maybe if I was sick, wich happened maybe 4-5 times in the past 10 years.\n\n- We go to bed at the same time, but my s/o takes like 1 minutes to fall asleep, around 10:30. As I don\u2019t usually feel tired before 11pm (even if I only slept 5 hours the night before). It takes me a good 30 minutes to fall asleep, usually between 11-midnight. I usually aim to get 8-9 hours of sleep.\n\n- I am not complaining about my chores load, as I feel it\u2019s fairly distributed. I love him and he\u2019s usually super emphatic and caring. We have a good friendship and communication. But in our 4 years together, this has been about 25% of our disagreements. We rarely fight or disagree so I feel like it\u2019s significant %.", "created_utc": 1678278938, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lv98g/aita_for_liking_to_sleep/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As long as you're a functional adult and you take care of your responsibilities in an efficient and timely manner, what you do with your spare time, including sleep, is no one's business. Not even your husband's. \n\nThe one point where I think he could have a leg to stand on, is if his complaint was about you not spending quality time with your child or him, as in, if you would be making sure the kid is tended to and the house was clear, the chores done, or your work handled and up to date, and then immediately going to sleep without ever sitting to play with your child or to watch a film or just have a chat with your partner. \n\nBut given his answer to why your sleeping habits bother him was that \"you could achieve more\" and not \"you sleep all the time and don't spend time with us\", that doesn't seem to be the case. \n\nSleeping in, napping often, lounging on a sofa doing hee haw. Those are things that society at large values as wishful thinking or a one-off kind of thing in their lives, but they condemn and consider lazy if it's routinary. Some people simply can't tolerate it and need to comment on it. \n\nMy father has always loved sleeping as well. My mother loves to joke that she makes sure to put \"nap\" in the schedule when they go on holidays, because a holiday isn't a holiday for him if he doesn't get to sleep like a log in a beautiful destination. \n\nIf he could immigrate and build a successful business, give his children a great start in life and remain in a happy marriage for 40 years, all while sleeping in every time he possibly could, then you're fine.", "INFO: How much time do you spend with your partner/child?

The norm for an adult sleep is anywhere between 6 to 10 hours, depending on the individual, so what if you are on the extreme end of the spectrum?", "I'm sorry you're tied to this guy forever. NTA", "Oh boy! Absolutely NTA! \n\nI have a lot of respect for you; it takes a lot to take care of a child and your husband, as well as every single household duty there is, and I completely understand why it\u2019s frustrating to hear someone be rude about simply catching up on your sleep! You deserve that rest! Being a stay-at-home mom is a full time job. \n\n\nPerhaps it might be a good idea to focus the conversation away from your sleeping habits, and more so on the value of what you do for your family from home. It sounds like your partner isn\u2019t connecting why his comments are so hurtful; perhaps try saying something along the lines of feeling undervalued? You clearly do a lot, and you deserve that appreciation if you\u2019re not receiving it already! \n\nI do want to clarify, your partner should not be putting you down for sleeping, and telling him it hurts your feelings should be enough. But, we\u2019re all human, and sometimes it takes an extra second to fully understand and empathize with those around us; perhaps he believes he\u2019s saying those comments in good faith without realizing the impact and implications his statements have.

You\u2019re a mother getting some rest, and that is completely okay. I hope everything works out!", "NTA, but you should discuss your sleep habits with your doctor. It's not really normal to be sleeping so much that multiple people comment on it.
