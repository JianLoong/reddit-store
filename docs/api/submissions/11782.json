{"id": 11782, "submission_id": "11lv98g", "title": "AITA for liking to sleep", "selftext": "I (26F) has always like to sleep. I jokingly says it\u2019s my favourite pass time as it\u2019s cheap. Growing up, my parents always hated when I slept in, but I thought it was what parents tell their teenagers. It still hurt my feelings when they complain about it though, as it made me feel lazy. \n\nI moved out a 23 to live with my fiance (25M). Thing is, he also naggs me about liking to sleep. I told him multiple times that it hurts my feelings as it makes me feel lazy, and that it the easiest way to piss me off. \n\nWe have a kid, and if the kid wakes up, I get up and take care of it. I cook dinner from scratch 5+ times a week, the other nights it either frozen meal or we eat out. Laundry is done, folded and put away and 90% of the time, my fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have to touch any laundry. Home is decently clean, my bills are paid, I prepare him lunch for work. I cut and peel fruits/veggies so he has healthy snacks to eat. When I\u2019m working (currently on maternity leave), I get up and am never late. I know I could do more around the house, anyone could always \u201cdo more\u201d. \n\nLast week, he commented in front of my parents that I had slept in. When we got home, I reminded him that these comments hurt my feelings and ask him why it bothers him so much that I sleep in when I can. He couldn\u2019t give me a clear answer, simply saying that I could achieve more. His answer makes me feel even more like a lazy a** and a failure, as I feel like I am happy with what I\u2019m achieving. But I am starting to wonder if I am really the problem for liking sleep, as I had comments on this for the pas 15 years, from my parents and now my s/o. \n\nSo, AITA for liking to sleep and getting mad at those comments?\n\nEDIT: To clarify and answer a few of you\n- I don\u2019t nap during the day, unless sick, wich is rare. \n\n- I get up when my kid gets up. If it\u2019s at 5 am, I only slept 5-6 hours, but I still get up. If he gets up at 10am, I get up at that time. \n\n- If I have nothing to wake me up or reasons to be up (work, kid, appointments, family stuff, chores, etc) I can sleep until noon. I can understand at some point my parents when living there, as I could sleep 12h most days of the week. But I had a full time job when I moved in with my s/o so I only slept in on vacation days and weekends when we had nothing planned. I usually work 5days/week. \n\n- We do spend time together. We have 1-2 dates a month without the kid, and a few family gathering/dates with the kid. We eat dinner at the table every night, play video games together, cuddle, watch movies, etc. \n\n- I have never missed any plans or gathering because I was sleeping. Again, except for maybe if I was sick, wich happened maybe 4-5 times in the past 10 years.\n\n- We go to bed at the same time, but my s/o takes like 1 minutes to fall asleep, around 10:30. As I don\u2019t usually feel tired before 11pm (even if I only slept 5 hours the night before). It takes me a good 30 minutes to fall asleep, usually between 11-midnight. I usually aim to get 8-9 hours of sleep.\n\n- I am not complaining about my chores load, as I feel it\u2019s fairly distributed. I love him and he\u2019s usually super emphatic and caring. We have a good friendship and communication. But in our 4 years together, this has been about 25% of our disagreements. We rarely fight or disagree so I feel like it\u2019s significant %.", "created_utc": 1678278938, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lv98g/aita_for_liking_to_sleep/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or they would make fun of me falling a lot as a kid and adult (it was my ankles dislocating and falling off to the side.) Here\u2019s my point...it\u2019s not normal for someone your age to love naps so much. There may be something more going on that you have gotten used to and accepted as normal.

His reasoning that you could be doing more is vague- what is he expecting you to do? What is there for you to do? I could accept a selfish answer like he misses you when you're asleep or is jealous of the sleep you're getting but he himself doesn't seem to know what he doesn't like.\n\nIt's a weird scenario, I assume there might be a problem there given that you say that your parents have raised this as well and you and your partner don't fight about much.

So?\" and don't give a single shit about their opinion.

I asked him if he\u2019d like me to go out with my friends every week and let him watch the kid, he said no.

You sleeping in doesn't negatively impact your life, OP, and a grown man should be capable of holding his tongue. If I were you, OP, I would stop being so kind to him about this - he is being a dick to you about this and it's clear that there is literally no reason to do it.\n\nBTW, OP, it sounds to me like you may have a later chronotype. Your chronotype is your body's natural circadian rhythm, which you **always** tend towards. It sounds like you would naturall sleep from 3am-11am or 4am-12pm if allowed to follow your body's own rhyhtms (which you in general are not being allowed, since society sucks). This is a biological reality that has nothing to do with laziness. The issue isn't you - it's that society has decided that \"sleeping late\" is a moral failing of some kind rather than a natural outcome of human diversity.\n\nLook into the chronotype info, OP. I don't think you \"like to sleep\" - I think you are forced to live \"off cycle\" in terms of circadian rhythms because society is a dick about these things.
