Not for refusing to pay the guy, but because you noticed him doing work on your lawn that you didn't intend to pay him for and didn't go to politely inform him where the property line was. You don't have to pay for work you didn't hire, but you should make sure the worker doing work on your property is aware they're doing work you don't intend to pay for. It's an asshole move to quietly accept someone doing work on your behalf without making sure they know the score in advanced.", "Info: how much cleaning on your side did the guy actually do? Did you at any point tell him that he was cleaning at your side of the property ? Did your neighbors know and see him cleaning on your side ?", "YTA you should have at least tipped him for doing extra work he wasn't specifically assigned to do.", "Of course not. Why would you pay someone whom you didn't ask for a service? Actually I wouldn't be that happy about blowing the leaves from the trees. That is not good for environment and the little bugs or hedgehog who can live under the leaves. I would tell them off :-D . Anyway why should you pay? And not your sister? If she is so concerned about it.", "INFO: It's your parents house. Why did your sister insist for YOU to pay the guy some money? Why didn't she tell her parents, or better: pay them herself?\n\nHaving said that.

My boyfriend and I just started doing yard clean up for people in our area. They may very well have known where the line was and didn't find that the job was complete cutting it off half way through the tree trunk circumference, hence finishing the surrounding area. Whether they knew or not is really irrelevant and I'd only consider this, at best, an esh if they did far more than that of your yard (and you didn't say something than). They got paid for the job, most likely knew what they were making prior to accepting it to. It's not like the neighbour didn't pay them for their time/work. That would make it a different story all together and you still wouldn't be at fault.", "So, neighbor is getting yard work done and during the course of said yard work debris got onto your yard and the person doing the yard work is cleaning up the mess they made and you're supposed to pay him?

Walk or wave simply and say hey X that\u2019s my side of the PL you don\u2019t need to clean), had this question been asked and cleaner didn\u2019t mind then OP would be clear.

You also want to avoid creating a situation where these guys think they can come onto your property,  do work unasked and then expect payment.  I'm not saying they did wrong or were doing this with negative intent, but if this or any service becomes a regular thing with your neighbour, everyone needs to be clear that they work for your neighbour on their property.

If it was too late by then and you did some work I\u2019d tip you few dollars. I was that person (not trees as a spectator but similar cross line mix up) and I did point it out so I don\u2019t need to imagine.\nIn your scenario had no one pointed it out to me and the property line was clearly distinctive with a fence for example sure id tell you to go away but this was not the situation of OP, they knew.\nBy the way we still don\u2019t know the answer from OP, could be OP told the guy and guy just did it anyway since they considered it as small thing"]}
