Doesn't everyone keep important documents with the good china?\n\nI used it when necessary and replaced it until I was about 20 and kept it.\n\nThe only reason she would need it is identity theft.", "Nta.\n\nYou are over 18. She no longer legally needs it. If she wants to keep it for sentimental reasons, that's her problem.", "NTA. Why does she think she needs your birth certificate. It\u2019s yours.", "NTA\n\nAnd WTF and oferfuxsake. This is YOUR DOCUMENT. You need it if you want, say, a passport. You are an adult and absolutely can go to the website of the state you were born in and ORDER YOUR OWN COPY!\n\nYour mother is ridiculous and you can tell her I said so.", "NTA. Check how much you need to pay for it and give her the money. Now you paid for it. \nUnless it\u2019s not about money but control\u2026", "Uhhh. You should absolutely be the one to have your birth certificate. You at least need to get a copy of it before you let her get her hands on it--that's an identifying document that you could need later in life. \n\nNTA.", "They're more expensive than I realized; in 2015 it was $16 for the first and $6 ea for additional ones at the same time.\n\nNow it's $26 for the first and $19 for each additional. \n\nFree for homeless youth or veterans in my state.\n\nMy brother called from another state asking for bc several years ago. Because he was notorious for losing ID and needed it for I9 on a new job I got 2. Got myself 2 for Real ID because the second one didn't cost much at the time.", "you might not be understanding, thats not an original copy, that's a certified copy.  if you get another copy, it will look identical, but newer.  you could give the newer one to mom or keep the newer one for yourself", "WHEN did she pay for it? Now it's important to note that the only original birth certificate is what's filed by the hospital with your county health department and issued by your state's department of vital records. The Mother's copy issued by the hospital isn't a certified copy and in recent times, may or may not be accepted as proof of identity. Certified copies are issued either by the health department in your birth county or the state vital records office. A certified copy is considered to be \"original\" due to the issuing authority, not because it's the first second, or fiftieth certified copy issued. \n\nIf she's being stubborn and just won't give you her copy, you will probably need to order a certified copy for you. My MIL still has her certified copy of my husband's birth certificate and he's 56. We had to order his a few years ago to have a copy. It wasn't worth the argument and is just as valid as hers. Once she dies, we'll have that copy too.", "If you were born in the US, you can easily order an official birth certificate with the raised seal from whatever county you were born in. I actually never had an official birth certificate until I was in my mid-30's. All I ever had was a copy of my record of birth from the hospital which worked for most things. I ordered an original birth certificate because I needed one to get a passport. I have several originals of my kid's birth certificates just for safekeeping, but if they want them, all they have to do is ask. Your mom is being weird for wanting to keep an original of yours.", "There\u2019s no difference. The copy she paid for is, in fact, a copy too. The original is stored somewhere in your county/state/country equivalent of the bureau for vital statistics. I ordered multiple copies of my own when I was applying for college, med school, residency, and licensure in several states.", "why on earth would an adult give up their legal id to another adult? Ive had my birth cert since I moved out at 18 because I need it for things like renewing my liscence snd getting a job... If she needs it, she can use a copy, but this sounds more like maintaining control over him than her having a genuine reason.", "Correct. The \u201coriginal\u201d is filed (digitally, microfilm, or paper) in the Bureau of Vital Statistics (or whatever it\u2019s called in different counties/states).", "You can get a \"certified copy\" with the State Seal on it that is just as valid.", "Certified copy", "Costs have gone up significantly and it's easy to go to the county for a new one if you live in the state you were born in", "FYI, a birth certificate is \\*not\\* for identification.  It establishes parentage and place of birth.", "Send a home photocopy with \"COPY\" written across it in sharpie", "I have used mine, in Canada, to vote, have used it to get a criminal record check. Whatever it may or may not be classified as, in some places it has uses that are important, it has no use for mom.", "My mom paid for my driver's license when I first got it.\n\nIt's still *MY driver's license* because it is *A LEGAL DOCUMENT* about *MY PERSON*.\n\nWe're not talking about a picture frame or a sweater.", "Wait, you\u2019re agreeing with most people here that he needs them, so why did you start to argue with u/klurtin?"]}
