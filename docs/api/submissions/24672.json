And to even add that she has no value to you guys anymore...her own family. My God.\n\nYou, as a parent, should support your children. You took your son's side on the matter, I understand. I think that's fine for wanting your daughter to pay her brother back. HOWEVER, there was no need for you to behave and say what you have as THEIR mother.

Depending on how long she tried to make it she might not have been back in regular workforce for long. That means she has had a limited time to save money to pay him back and we don't know what her salary is. Now, if she has no intention to repay the loan, that's different.

The situation sucks... but calling her a disappointment and saying she has no value anymore to whoever \"us\" is... is pretty fucked up. \n\nCovid messed up a LOT of people's lives and closed MANY well-established businesses across the WORLD, not just in the US.

She can support her son without trashing her daughter on a fundamental level.", "Kitchen is asking key questions. I'd also like to know if a payback arrangement was discussed.

Yep it is, but it gives him legal ground to sue, at least that's what I guess from this", "Regardless, knowing she owes that much she should be upfront about it and not make him ask or take such measures to get it back.\n\n'Sorry I'm struggling can we work out a repayment plan?'\n\nSounds like she's hoping it will be forgotten or ignoring it will make it go away.", "Yes. She took out a loan. It's now her responsibility to pay it back and to find out if any government loans would cover anything.", "News flash : dysfunctional families exist. OP chose to do something beyond the point of no return. That makes her cheap , vulgar and insensitive. But it's not enough to know that she is a contemptible or detestable asshole.

Good luck with that.  You told her she has no value she\u2019s 24 years old. Did you never make a mistake when you were young. And your son he takes right after you serving his sister and suing her.  She comes from a great family.", "YTA.

They're even upset that he's suing her. 20k is a lot of money to most people, enough to sue over. She can't get the leniency of family when she doesn't do the basic thing family does and try to pay it back.\n\nShe borrowed money and hasn't even tried to work out a plan to pay it back for 3 whole years. She's basically stolen from your son and wants him to drop it. \n\nAnd family that steals money in the tens of thousands range is family that's not worth having. Family that can't be trusted is family that has no value.", "Wow, just wow. You are a shitty mom. Your daughter is is the loser she is because of her upbringing.

Would he be expecting proceeds of profits if her business had taken off? \n\nYTA, and an enormous one. You son isn\u2019t a disappointment for suing his sister? They way you tell it she became useless once she was served with papers. What happened during the COVID pandemic isn\u2019t an excuse for her business failing, plenty of businesses that had been well established and operating for generations failed. \n\nI\u2019d be surprised if your daughter doesn\u2019t see you & her brother as disappointments.", "No value! This happened during covid! To say that to your daughter shows how little value you have. You cruel, heartless, judgemental, jealous, bi@tch.

Yes she owes money but if she can\u2019t pay it without damaging her life then you can just expect her to hand over everything she has. She literally got the money to start a business which failed, if the business had succeeded then she\u2019d have to money to pay back.\n\nYes it\u2019s annoying that she hasn\u2019t managed to pay back her brother but that\u2019s an issue between them, it doesn\u2019t warrant an input from you, especially one so rude and heartbreaking.", "If anyone\u2019s a disappointment, it\u2019s you as a parent.

Since when has money become more important than family? Since when it is appropriate to call your child \u2013 not the behaviour \u2013 but the child a \"major disappointment\" and then tell her them has no value to you or your family? I'm disgusted.\n\nYour son willingly, purposefully took a risk by offering an unsecured loan to a family member. He shouldn't have offered if he didn't want to risk the chance of not being paid back. (You never loan money to friends or family if you aren't willing to never see the money again. End of.)  Your daughter also took a risk, and it is disappointing that she hasn't tried to pay at least some of the money back. Even just a token amount would mean something. That said, you claim to be a family, but you treat each other worse than some strangers would.\n\nI won't speak to a brother who would sue his sister other than to say that's an asshole move all by itself. But for you, her mother, to take his side and say what you said to her is abhorrent. If that's how easily you break bond with your child, then you must have never cared much for her in the first place. And, you have said you're happy to see her with nothing as long as your son gets the money he obviously could afford to be without back.\n\nYou could have approached this from understanding. You could have sat down and set an agreed-upon amount within her budget that she could afford. He could have forgiven part (or all) of the debt. You could have worked together and made compromises to resolve a situation as a family. But no. Instead, you chose to act like Shylock going after a pound of flesh.", "Bet your gonna be shocked when your daughter decides she\u2019s not speaking to you anymore and goes NC, huh?\n\nYTA", "Family will be the first ones to screw you over this is why i don\u2019t loan ANYBODY money .", "Soo your daughter only had value while she didn\u2019t owe money to your son and while you assumed she can easily pay it back even after her business failed due to unforeseen circumstances? Well guess we know who your favourite is. And finally your daughter knows as well. You are a major fkin asshole and a terrible mother. Can\u2019t believe you came here to even ask that. YTA all the way!!", "YTA. Putting a monetary value on your child makes you the asshole.", "[deleted]", "How does suing her make him a disappointment?

The business flopped due to covid. Stick to what is written", "Fundamental is the word! Too right!!", "How rich are you that $20k is a small amount?", "Handshake deals. And I think only certain states recognize them.", "But is she ignoring it? From OP's description, they had a family reunion going on with more than just immediate family if I read this correctly. I would not like to discuss money in that situation/company. \n\nShe should have been proactive about a repayment plan and initiated a private conversation with her brother (when she got a new job and saw what her income was). I think it's fair to call her an AH about that, but she's not an AH for not being able to pay him back yet.", "Compared to a mortgage or a car loan, it's a small amount.\n\nIt sounds like the bro could afford to give it.", "I don't think she is either but if she was upfront this wouldn't have happened at the reunion. Maybe brother is frustrated. He did something nice for his sister and she is making him 'harass' her for the money. Fiance is no help either - could have politely said can we talk about it later but using the term harasses just adds to the tension", "So? It's banks that give those, not regular people. And if you fail to pony up the money for those loans, banks will seize your assets to repay them. They won't even wait 3 years before asking you to repay.\n\nHe's been far more generous than a bank would be, and she's been far more entitled than a normal bank customer would be.", "It all depends on their initial agreement.", "I don't think most courts would consider $20k to be a gift. Not unless the son is super rich to the point he can give out $20k and not miss it. The question is whether it's an investment and I think that would be easy to prove since he'd then have to own part of the company."]}
