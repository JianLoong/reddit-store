I think that's fine for wanting your daughter to pay her brother back. HOWEVER, there was no need for you to behave and say what you have as THEIR mother.

Insult to injury.", "Perfect.", "Is it even the daughter's fault she hasn't paid back yet? Loan was given 3 years ago, and lost due to covid. Depending on how long she tried to make it she might not have been back in regular workforce for long. That means she has had a limited time to save money to pay him back and we don't know what her salary is. Now, if she has no intention to repay the loan, that's different. They should have talked about a repayment plan.", "Even if she files bankruptcy she will have to sell everything she owns to pay back her brother. Her cars and house if she has them.", "Yeah YTA. The situation sucks... but calling her a disappointment and saying she has no value anymore to whoever \"us\" is... is pretty fucked up. \n\nCovid messed up a LOT of people's lives and closed MANY well-established businesses across the WORLD, not just in the US.
