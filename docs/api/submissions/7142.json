I told her that while I have no intent to replace his father, it is ridiculous that I have no say when it comes to Leo since he lives in my house. I also told her that her behaviour towards Leo is smothering and that if she keeps up like this she will drive him away. When i said that i think it really hit her.\n\nShe started to listen more and was a lot more receptive to what I had to say. I told her that the tracking app was a violation of their privacy and that if she wants to keep them then she must let them (my eldest daughter and Leo, our other kids are young enough where I think tracking them is ok) turn it on and off. If she wants to know where they are she can call or text them.\n\nShe tried to get me to tell her where Leo has been hiding. I told her I'm not telling her. I have gained Leo\u2019s trust and having an adult round that he can confide in and trust will be very helpful while she's trying to repair her relationship with him. Also I told her to think about how far she's pushing him if he needs to find a place to hide from her.\n\nI told her that we should look into therapy, both as a couple and just for her, as it will be able to help her deal with her emotions and help her on her path to reconnect with her son.\n\nAt the end of this we had a look at local therapists and she also sat down with Leo and let him tell her how he feels, promising him he can say anything and he won't be in trouble.\n\nI'm also going to be having a talk with Leo, just so he knows i'm here for him, also to tell me or his dad if anything happens and to tell him that while his mother wants to make things right, things can happen on his timeline, and he doesn't have to do anything, forgive anything or talk about anything that he is not ready for yet.\n\nIt's only a start and we still have a way to go as a family but I think this is a step in the right direction. Thank you for your help.\n\nAlso i wanted to answer a few questions i was getting on my original post.\n\n* Yes she parents my daughter, because i let her\n* Leo\u2019s dad and I are on friendly terms but he wasn't aware of a lot of this happening as Leo hadn't told him.\n* My daughter is 15 and my younger two are both 4 (not twins, the elder one turns 5 very soon and my youngest only recently turned 4)\n* The kids did know about the tracker but they didn't really get a choice in it\n* Yes me and my wife marries after only being together for 6 months, it was kinda an ultimatum i was given but i didn't really mind\n* I didn't really think it was a necessary detail but it caused some debate in the comments. Yes Leo is gay, he had told me and his father, but his mother has not been told.\n* Leo is the spitting image of his father, but I don't think the resemblance caused the issues like some of you suggested, but I don't know for sure since my wife never gave me an answer when I tried to find out why.\n\nEdit: added original post", "created_utc": 1673532568, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a0j6o/update_aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_where_her_son/", "score": 2026, "replies": ["I feel like I just opened a new book in the middle.\n\nEdit: NTA keep doing what you\u2019re doing!

You sir did right by this young man Leo living under your roof. Mom is the parent, but since Leo's dad isn't in the day-to-day things, your wife seems to have fallen in the singleparenting trap with her eldest child: \"Everything I say or do is right, since I'm the adult.\" Not saying everysingleparent does, just some who could benefit from another adult giving feedback and healthy boundaries. Its not concious, I think they feel overwhelmed and try to keep control. (Like my mom and also now my sister.)\n\nGlad to hear you go together and your wife also on her own to therapy.

The fact that he felt comfortable enough to tell (or even confirm, if that\u2019s what happened) you speaks volumes about the trust he has in you, and the fact that you haven\u2019t told your wife is something he\u2019ll probably remember and be thankful for for the rest of his life.

It's far more likely to work out well when she has a support system backing her up. Just make sure that you remind her if it is not something brought up in therapy that teenage boys can be very distant no matter how good a relationship you have, so if she's working to rebuild it can be very slow going and it may never be quite what she wanted, and she needs to make sure she can be okay with that", "NTA, it sounds like youre trying to help their relationship.", "I think it\u2019s great that you are becoming a confidant for him and that he feels he can trust you.
