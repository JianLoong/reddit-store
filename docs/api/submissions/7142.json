I told her that while I have no intent to replace his father, it is ridiculous that I have no say when it comes to Leo since he lives in my house. I also told her that her behaviour towards Leo is smothering and that if she keeps up like this she will drive him away. When i said that i think it really hit her.\n\nShe started to listen more and was a lot more receptive to what I had to say. I told her that the tracking app was a violation of their privacy and that if she wants to keep them then she must let them (my eldest daughter and Leo, our other kids are young enough where I think tracking them is ok) turn it on and off. If she wants to know where they are she can call or text them.\n\nShe tried to get me to tell her where Leo has been hiding. I told her I'm not telling her. I have gained Leo\u2019s trust and having an adult round that he can confide in and trust will be very helpful while she's trying to repair her relationship with him. Also I told her to think about how far she's pushing him if he needs to find a place to hide from her.\n\nI told her that we should look into therapy, both as a couple and just for her, as it will be able to help her deal with her emotions and help her on her path to reconnect with her son.\n\nAt the end of this we had a look at local therapists and she also sat down with Leo and let him tell her how he feels, promising him he can say anything and he won't be in trouble.\n\nI'm also going to be having a talk with Leo, just so he knows i'm here for him, also to tell me or his dad if anything happens and to tell him that while his mother wants to make things right, things can happen on his timeline, and he doesn't have to do anything, forgive anything or talk about anything that he is not ready for yet.\n\nIt's only a start and we still have a way to go as a family but I think this is a step in the right direction. Thank you for your help.\n\nAlso i wanted to answer a few questions i was getting on my original post.\n\n* Yes she parents my daughter, because i let her\n* Leo\u2019s dad and I are on friendly terms but he wasn't aware of a lot of this happening as Leo hadn't told him.\n* My daughter is 15 and my younger two are both 4 (not twins, the elder one turns 5 very soon and my youngest only recently turned 4)\n* The kids did know about the tracker but they didn't really get a choice in it\n* Yes me and my wife marries after only being together for 6 months, it was kinda an ultimatum i was given but i didn't really mind\n* I didn't really think it was a necessary detail but it caused some debate in the comments. Yes Leo is gay, he had told me and his father, but his mother has not been told.\n* Leo is the spitting image of his father, but I don't think the resemblance caused the issues like some of you suggested, but I don't know for sure since my wife never gave me an answer when I tried to find out why.\n\nEdit: added original post", "created_utc": 1673532568, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a0j6o/update_aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_where_her_son/", "score": 330, "replies": ["I feel like I just opened a new book in the middle.\n\nEdit: NTA keep doing what you\u2019re doing! Although I would be hesitant to allow other kids up there just from a liability issue.\n\nThis is a great update and I hope your wife is committed to conflict resolution. Good luck!", "Good for you, you\u2019ve done really well by Leo and he knows now, more than ever, that he has a good man in his life who has his back.", "You sound like the best of parents. Your wife really needs to get on board.", "That\u2019s a good update! She was a lot more receptive than I thought she\u2019d be based on the original thread.", "I am so confused.\n\nHow old is Leo?\n\nWhen you say hiding did he run away?", "*hands crown* You dropped this. Seriously, you are a role model for loads of parents. Keep doing what you're doing. Clearly NTA.", "You did really well with Leo! And your wife was over the top... Really good you suggested therapie and offered Leo that you will have an open ear for him. He seems to really trust you! Go on with this way, you got this!", "I feel like a congratulations are in order with what sounds like amazing progress for everyone. Good luck with it all OP, you sound like a fantastic Dad!!", "Wow.  Great job! You are being a great support for Leo.\n\nHuge props and respect!", "Great job being that safe adult for Leo. It matter so much.", "NTA\n\nI'm glad you sat your wife down and discuss these problems.  It's great that Leo has not only one father but another adult he can talk too.", "Seems like a reasonable, level-headed parent.", "NTA: Your wife sounds like a narcissist. Tracking her son and giving you an ultimatum to marry her after 6 months? She just wants to control everything.", "Good, and still absolutely NTA\n\nShe definitely needs to respect and allow his boundaries at 16 for some personal space and privacy.\n\nHope the counseling works out for everyone", "16 year old that hides from his mom and lies about where he\u2019s been is a recipe for disaster. I know everyone is cheering you on for being the supportive SF that has Leo\u2019s back, but be careful just how much you \u201ccover\u201d for him, because at that age kids get up to some very dangerous stuff, and he already knows you\u2019re willing to cover for him with his mom.", "It sounds like you and your family are on the right path. Well handled and I wish all of you the best!", "sorry, ive added the a link to the original post", "Leo is 16\n\nhes been hiding on the roof\n\nive linked the original for further context", "Part of me is concerned that she got pregnant intentionally to trap him based on the ages of his daughters and her ultimatum.", "Yes! \nAnd seriously in the original everyone griping about the phone tracker on a teenagers phone. Wild how people thinks kids should just have completely autonomy while still having their parents baby them for eternity. \n\nOnly on Reddit\u2026", "I'm sorry, I've got to ask. You got married because of an ultimatum and you're okay with that? I would have thought that was the first red flag!\n\nFocusing on the actual update, good job! I'm glad Leo has you on his side and your wife agreed to therapy :)", "Ahhh this makes much more sense. No NTA-  I mean I am not opposed to tracking if the kids are aware and parents have the right to their own opinion- but you both need to be on board.   \n\nI think Leo sounds like he has a great stepdad.", "NTA. Leo is close to an adult. The mom needs to stop treating him like a baby and stealing his autonomy. I'd be careful how much you cover for him, but so far seems like you're looking out for Leo.\n\nI applaud you for getting your wife to start therapy!", "Big smile. You sir did right by this young man Leo living under your roof. Mom is the parent, but since Leo's dad isn't in the day-to-day things, your wife seems to have fallen in the singleparenting trap with her eldest child: \"Everything I say or do is right, since I'm the adult.\" Not saying everysingleparent does, just some who could benefit from another adult giving feedback and healthy boundaries. Its not concious, I think they feel overwhelmed and try to keep control. (Like my mom and also now my sister.)\n\nGlad to hear you go together and your wife also on her own to therapy. Communication is key. Also I really liked what you said to Leo not forcing hin to talk about anything.\nNTA", "You are rocking being a stepdad and everything you told her was concise and accurate. I hope she really does take it to heart.", "Good deal. Leo needs someone he's comfortable talking to and I think you really proved yourself by not selling him out so hopefully he knows you're there for him when needed. Stay blessed.", "Very NTA\n\nIt sounds like you are encouraging a lot of positive developments in your family. I\u2019m so glad to hear that you\u2019ve been able to get communication going and that you\u2019re taking steps to get professional guidance. Maybe your step son would also benefit from therapy?\n\nI think you\u2019re doing the right thing by protecting your step son\u2019s trust in you. You\u2019ve previously mentioned that he is safe in his hiding place. At most, maybe you could assure his mom of that. Really, you\u2019re making sure a young person has a safe adult he can talk to. That is so important. It doesn\u2019t have to be a parent, though it\u2019s great if it is. You can be a father-like person or a mentor for him, while still respecting the role of his dad.\n\nI hope you see a lot of progress towards a more harmonious family life.", "You\u2019re a good dad, OP. Leo is lucky to have you in his life.", "Can you be my dad? \ud83d\ude2d", "You're a good egg OP.  That kid has an amazing role model in you and I hope you end up being a great father figure for him.  I'm glad your wife has listened to some reason and is willing to repair the relationship between her and her son.", "OMF where were you to give my folks a reality check when I was 15? \n\nSeriously, you're great and keep being great.", "You are rocking being a stepdad and everything you told her was concise and accurate.", "I'm the adult.\" Not saying everysingleparent does, just some who could benefit from another adult giving feedback and healthy boundaries.", "It is not like he was going out to other places... the boy is literally staying at the house the whole time. NTA", "I see I\u2019m being downvoted, so\u2026 DON\u2019T be careful appears to be the popular consensus. Teenage boys NEVER get up to trouble, so help him continue to lie to his mother about what he\u2019s up to and EVERYTHING will be OK. What could go wrong?", "Just read it. NTA at all!", "I would probably delete this post and the other unless you want to accidentally out your son", ">I'm sorry, I've got to ask. You got married because of an ultimatum and you're okay with that? I would have thought that was the first red flag!\n\nI was gonna say, most good parent's don't even bring a new partner round their kids until they've been dating that long, nevermind jumping into marriage especially because of an ultimatum."]}
