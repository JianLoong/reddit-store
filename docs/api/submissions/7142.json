I told her that while I have no intent to replace his father, it is ridiculous that I have no say when it comes to Leo since he lives in my house. I also told her that her behaviour towards Leo is smothering and that if she keeps up like this she will drive him away. When i said that i think it really hit her.\n\nShe started to listen more and was a lot more receptive to what I had to say. I told her that the tracking app was a violation of their privacy and that if she wants to keep them then she must let them (my eldest daughter and Leo, our other kids are young enough where I think tracking them is ok) turn it on and off. If she wants to know where they are she can call or text them.\n\nShe tried to get me to tell her where Leo has been hiding. I told her I'm not telling her. I have gained Leo\u2019s trust and having an adult round that he can confide in and trust will be very helpful while she's trying to repair her relationship with him. Also I told her to think about how far she's pushing him if he needs to find a place to hide from her.\n\nI told her that we should look into therapy, both as a couple and just for her, as it will be able to help her deal with her emotions and help her on her path to reconnect with her son.\n\nAt the end of this we had a look at local therapists and she also sat down with Leo and let him tell her how he feels, promising him he can say anything and he won't be in trouble.\n\nI'm also going to be having a talk with Leo, just so he knows i'm here for him, also to tell me or his dad if anything happens and to tell him that while his mother wants to make things right, things can happen on his timeline, and he doesn't have to do anything, forgive anything or talk about anything that he is not ready for yet.\n\nIt's only a start and we still have a way to go as a family but I think this is a step in the right direction. Thank you for your help.\n\nAlso i wanted to answer a few questions i was getting on my original post.\n\n* Yes she parents my daughter, because i let her\n* Leo\u2019s dad and I are on friendly terms but he wasn't aware of a lot of this happening as Leo hadn't told him.\n* My daughter is 15 and my younger two are both 4 (not twins, the elder one turns 5 very soon and my youngest only recently turned 4)\n* The kids did know about the tracker but they didn't really get a choice in it\n* Yes me and my wife marries after only being together for 6 months, it was kinda an ultimatum i was given but i didn't really mind\n* Leo is the spitting image of his father, but I don't think the resemblance caused the issues like some of you suggested, but I don't know for sure since my wife never gave me an answer when I tried to find out why.\n\nEdit: added original post", "created_utc": 1673532568, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a0j6o/update_aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_where_her_son/", "score": 2889, "replies": ["I feel like I just opened a new book in the middle.\n\nEdit: NTA keep doing what you\u2019re doing!

You sir did right by this young man Leo living under your roof.

Its not concious, I think they feel overwhelmed and try to keep control. (Like my mom and also now my sister.)\n\nGlad to hear you go together and your wife also on her own to therapy.

The fact that he felt comfortable enough to tell (or even confirm, if that\u2019s what happened) you speaks volumes about the trust he has in you, and the fact that you haven\u2019t told your wife is something he\u2019ll probably remember and be thankful for for the rest of his life.

Could you perhaps be the wife?", "At some point as kids get older, violating their confidence is a significant enough concern to justify withholding information in particular cases from your spouse.\n\nI'd judge this to be one of those cases.  \n\nThe root problem is Mom's relationship with her son, and without fixing that, we're in \"best of bad options\" territory.  Refusing to be transparent with her is ultimately a cost of that.", "oh i wouldn\u2019t blame him either lol", "OP could have easily worn protection!\n\nIt\u2019s not that easy to babytrap someone if they don\u2019t want it", "I agree with this. When I first started therapy my therapist said that I shouldn't feel ashamed for how quickly I feel love, and that everyone has a different speed.  \nWhen I met my wife, our speed matched *hard* and we had marriage on the table within 2 months. We were going to wait to get married until I could propose in person.  \nThen one day we are talking, she's a little emotional, and she confesses to me that she wants to be my wife so badly it hurts, so we got married. This was ten months in.  \n  \nWe are now coming up to our 3 year anniversary, and we couldn't be happier.", "Touch\u00e9. I mean, for the last line, haha.\n\nNothing can be added to this. Move around, people, carry on.", "Finally a step parent story where they're the sane ones.  \n\n\nBack your son up when he eventually does come out to his mom. Good chance that she's been saying some dumb shit that's got him hiding away.", "You're awesome. That's it.", "you handled everything very well. Leo is lucky to have someone like you in their life", "Ur a good dad. I\u2019m glad ur wig is getting help, it seems like she puts a lot of pressure on herself and those around her esp w the ultimatum and all. Still tho y\u2019all have a big family and I can tell y\u2019all love each other since your willing to work and improve. Gl.", "I'm glad to hear your wife is really working to work on these issues. I hope your family is able to grow and heal from this.", "You are a wonderful step-dad to Leo.", "OP you are a great dad to Leo and this is one of the furthest steps in the right direction I\u2019ve ever seen! Keep up the great work!!", "I have read the original post and your update why YTA all the way. And all you whiny babies talking about her she\u2019s stalking her kid the kids 16 years old when he\u2019s 18 and buys his own damn phones and he can keep the tracking information off of it for you to know where her child is and not tell her you\u2019re manipulating her and the situation. She has every right to know where her minor children are. So now you and the 16 year old son are conspiring against his mother to keep secrets from her. She raises your daughter because you let her she raises her daughter because it\u2019s her daughter   She should just run like Hell sign of a custody to his father and get the hell away from you.", "I\u2019m shocked at how many people and NTA It\u2019s almost as if a bunch of 16 year olds for writing these responses because any parent worth their salt knows they should know where their kids are.", "This update makes me happy! You\u2019re being a good stepdad to Leo and I hope your wife takes the necessary steps to rebuild her relationship with him.", "So you are keeping many more secrets from wife. You are being controlling in your way. I truly feel sorry for wife.", "Absolutely. OP should write a book on step-parenting.", "The context is that she's already shown in the original post that she's controlling AF when it comes to the son. This is just another example of that behavior to add to the list.", "My fiancee and I did this I think. We met in Discord and were friends, then we thought we should get married for tax purposes. However over the past two years we've become completely smitten with each other. Apparently we're so sickeningly sweet multiple people in our Discord servers say we're giving them diabetes lol.", "God that's cute. I'm too cynical to do something like that, but it warms my soul to hear of that magic happening for others :)", "Is your wife on any social media? Loads of AITA posts, especially those with updates, get posted to tik tok, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and other subreddits. This is a relatively specific situation, so I worry that your wife will somehow see this post and you will have outed Leo. The chances may be low, but as a parental figure of someone gay this is the way you need to start thinking. This is privileged information, and until he has come out more widely you need to be very very careful. No mentioning it to colleagues who have zero connections to your wife so you aren't worried it will get back to her, no alluding to it with people you trust, and honestly? Not posting about it with such specific details to the most viewed subreddit. \n\nThis is all very positive and I am so happy for you! And maybe you've changed enough details, or she (and any friends or relatives she has told about this situation) are so offline there's no chance of her seeing it. Honestly, if you had excluded the part about his sexuality, her finding out the hiding place from it would suck, but not be so bad. But you need to adjust how you consider talking about this subject publicly in a way someone could very easily connect to you if given the opportunity.", "Honestly, you're an amazing stepfather fron what it sounds like. And despite his mother trying to prevent it... It sounds like Leo really looks up to you as someone he can trust.\n\nI will say... Her smothering him? Isolating him from you? Her overbearing nature and tone? The \"fighting\" with Leo? She sounds very manipulative and abusive. She needs that therapy bad", "Also fits in malicious compliance", "W Dad", "For a person not parenting, you are an awesome parent.", "I just want to say thank you for being Leo's ally in this shit show :)", "Teen suicide is an epidemic.  If a teen feels isolated and pushed into a corner, he could do something drastic.\n\nI am glad you are on his side.  But something needs to change.  She needs to understand the risk she is taking with her son\u2019s well being.  Teens don\u2019t always think of the consequences of their actions, they can be impulsive.  It\u2019s why suicide is such a problem.\n\nThat boy is crying out for help.  Maybe family counseling is in order. \n\nErr on the side if keeping him safe.", "my almost 5 year old has a cell phone (nothing fancy but she can call and text us) and my 4 year old has a tablet that she takes most places with her.", "she was pregnant and said she would go back to her family (who live in a different country) while she was pregnant and not let me see the child unless we got married and moved in together.", "thank you, i didn't think about it like this, i thought since she doesn't use reddit it would be fine. the thought of this post making it off platform never occurred to me, i removed that part.", "i did initially leave it out of my original, but the vagueness of the topic caused debate and arguments in the comments, that's why i included it. my wife does not use reddit and i have permission form my son to mention to others that he is gay as long as i do not tell his mother.", "Truth.  My husband and I were together 6 months then married. 4 sons and nearly 44 years later, going stronger than ever.  Sometimes, you just *know* .", "Yep. My husband and I were married two months after meeting. It's been 20 years this August and was the best decision I'd ever made. Sometimes, it's just that right.", "My husband had been with his ex for 5 years, got married, shit went south real fast and they were divorced 4 months later.  We met 2 years later when he was convinced he would never even have a serious relationship again, let alone a marriage.  He half-seriously asked me to marry him 2 weeks after we started hanging out (which was every day).  I made him wait and ask me for real 3 years later.  We've been through hell and back and are happier than ever in our 12 years together.  We really just knew.", ">Yes me and my wife marries after only being together for 6 months, it was kinda an ultimatum i was given but i didn't really mind\n\nI'm sorry but good fucking luck. She showed you her true colors back then and accepted it", "NTA. You sound like a really good guy. Good luck.", "Makes me kind of sad your son isn\u2019t out to his mom. I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s a good reason for that. I\u2019m glad he has you and his bio dad to support him, sounds like he\u2019ll need it.", "NTA I would do the same.", "OP\n\nI think that this is a very good start.  Hopefully she will take to heart and it gets to where it can help and improve her relationship with her son.", "You're a good stepdad.", "So she would abandon her son (who would have been 11?) and deprive her new baby of a father if she didn't get what she wanted?\n\nYour wife is messed up.", "Not only that, for some people as they get older (or at least as they age through a certain period of their life) it becomes \"more urgent\".\n\nThat time period is obviously their late 30s.  Personally I couldn't care less but if you hit 35, you're female, don't have kids and want them, then there's a massive biological push and many see marriage as a requirement for that.  Personally I can't imagine rushing things, but I can see why others might."]}
