It only needs to reach 165 during cooking, as that\u2019s the temp that instantly kills most harmful bacteria. Given that he was already cutting it up for the kids, it likely was down to safe eating temperature.", "She's a professional baker, there is a probe in that kitchen somewhere.", "I have that certification and I couldn't tell you the safe cooking temp for chicken. It's extremely easy to get that certification.", "Yeah no\u2026 like the other poster says, servsafe is for management. For example, my husband is an executive chef and he has his.. his 2 sous chefs, probably couldn\u2019t even pass it and don\u2019t have theirs.", "Australia also calls it ham and cheese toasties", "That makes me so sad for you.", "There is a probe, but he doesn't know how to find it. And he won't ask his wife to show it to him, even though he insists he knows when she is done.", "OP writes \"mum\" too.", "If yanks don't say it I'd say it might be UK or one of the colonies. It's one way to say it here in Australia. Pretty sure it's what Maccas calls them.", "Yep from the US when he said \"toasties\" I legitimately thought this guy put a few toaster strudels in the toaster and said he \"made\" dinner.", "I have been to quite a few bakeries in the US with savory options. One of my favorite bakeries is known for its delicious hot and cold sandwiches and its breakfasts. They also do donuts, cakes, pastries, and bread. Ugh makes me want to drive there rn.", "Chicken pot pies are pretty common in NorCal.  Even the Costco stores carry them.", "I mean, we eat an equivalent food, we just don\u2019t *call* it that.", "No chance I'm eating pink chicken. Fucking gross.", "NTA. Salmonella poisoning is not fun at all. Always best to not eat it when in doubt.", "I think you phrased it best.\n\nYou validated OP's legitimate safety concern, you stuck to the situation presented without judging their lifestyle choices, while also getting to the meat of the issue why OP was wrong and how he should of handled it differently.", "Was going to say, I\u2019ve never grilled a chicken after dry brining that wasn\u2019t ever so slightly pink unless it was also irredeemably dry. If you dry brine, get used to seeing a faint pink tinge.", "Well it\u2019s easier to be better at cooking if you do it all the time. Maybe OP should practice so he can also be good at it.", "When a spouse says, \u201cthen you do it\u201d in an exasperated tone, 9/10, it\u2019s because they think their spouse isn\u2019t pulling their weight and is pissed at being corrected for that very reason.", "OP sounds more like a Homer than a Bart if we're being honest here.", "She\u2019s better at it! And god knows you don\u2019t get better at cooking just by practicing cooking! \u2026.wait\u2026.", "Yeah, what?? Why did I have to scroll so far down for this? This woman co-owns a bakery (usually super long hours beginning before dawn), AND takes care of 90% of the domestic labor?? Unacceptable.", "I'd say it's a damn good indicator if it reached 165, unless it's either right up by the bone and won't ever look done because of the little myoglobin left. But definitely not a good indication of safety. Chicken absolutely doesn't have to be cooked to 165. Try actually doing that on chicken breast, it's not good. Chicken can be safe cooked to much lower temps. Even if you're just grilling it you really only need to go to 155 to be safe. But do that shit sous vide and you don't even need to go over 145.", "For real! It makes me really uneasy! It\u2019s 2022- how can we still expect so little of men? If both partners are working, then both partners need to contribute to the housework and child rearing duties. End of story.", "I'm red-green colorblind so I use a meat thermometer for safety. Ironically, the rest of my family gets sketched out by my chicken because they judge by color alone and overcook their chicken.", "The fact that ham and cheese toastie is OP's goto makes me think they know very little about cooking. Let alone the fact that chicken being pink or not isn't a great indicator whether the chicken is done.", "Well, he obviously is there to tell her how she\u2019s doing it wrong. A vital role in household management! /s", "This is what I was wondering. OP, why does your wife do everything? Then you come in like the hero making a glorified grilled cheese sandwich?", "Not just chicken. Even with steak (that I usually get medium rare), my friends always warn me that I could die because its too pink and they find it disgusting.", "Where can I find me a prize like him? What a catch(!)", "It is also completely stupid to say a baker is not a chef. Given that baking is about the most difficult cooking you can do, to me it's the equivalent of telling someone they are not a doctor, because they are just a surgeon.", ">it's dry and white as a retro dog turd. \n\nI feel both attacked and died from laughing at the same time. Bravo!", "My GF is a red seal chef and I am EXTREMELY careful about what I say about her cooking for exactly this reason. I may be an idiot when it comes to cooking but at least I can recognize that and defer to her judgement. I also realize I\u2019m very lucky to be eating top quality restaurant food at home so really. Who am I to say this chicken looks pink or that\u2019s a weird way to cook bacon? Just stfu and enjoy XD", "Lol your friends are extra special.", "Or the cooking utensils!!!! Don't serve the cooked food with the same tongs or spatula you were using during cooking, because it could still have bacteria on it, and as soon as you remove the meat from the heart source, you're no longer killing any surface contamination from the utensil. Use a fresh utensil to move the cooked meat from the pan to the plates.", "I downvoted and took it back after reading again \ud83d\ude2d", "Seasons it, how ethnic.\n\nSome people don't even do that.", "Using the same utensil is unlikely to get you in trouble if you're cooking with proper heat, but switching them out is an easy way to just avoid the potential problem.", "It might be the best snark I've seen all month", "We had a weird oven in one of our apartments that lied about the temp.  The first time I \nslightly undercooked chicken with it, I was alright with it, he was not.  And then we just...stuck it back in for a bit.  This family must have some hangry people.", "OP might alsi be Australian or Kiwi."]}
