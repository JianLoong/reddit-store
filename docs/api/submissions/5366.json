I told her I\u2019m not letting them eat this if it\u2019s pink, she told me to stop being a baby and it won\u2019t kill them. I kept telling her it\u2019s pink in the middle they shouldn\u2019t eat that they can get food poisoning and that\u2019s it\u2019s dangerous for them. She told me \u201cif you don\u2019t want them eating it then you can cook their dinner\u201d. \n\nI made them cheese and ham toasties, also made her one but she didn\u2019t eat it.

I think wife just needs to take a step back and realize that this isn\u2019t about you or the kids not liking the food, it\u2019s literally because it could have potentially been undercooked.

I wouldn't expect you to serve your kids something that would be harmful for them, but couldn't you have, you know, pulled out a meat thermometer before wasting your wife's efforts and the food?

You kept the kids health in mind and didn't want to get them really sick. I don't see how most people can't understand that any pink in chicken is NOT safe to consume.
