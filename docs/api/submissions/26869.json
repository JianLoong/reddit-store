I\u2019ve met these cousins multiple times but this was the first time going away. One of his second cousins and his wife (in their 40s) are extremely intense about recycling.\n\nFor example, one night there were about 25 people to feed and they refused to use the eco-friendly paper plates I brought. They actually told me off for bringing them, and we all used glass. We also brought a case of waters in plastic bottles (which we never drink at home, we have a filter and use glasses, but do on the rare time we go away) and as soon as they saw it they told us to bring it back to the car and that they didn\u2019t want to see it again. Everyone else had reusable water bottles. We had to go find a collapsible one that happened to be in our car and share that. They also yelled at me when I didn\u2019t drink the last sip of my beer, which was warm since I had been drinking it for 2 hours, and they made me drink it before throwing it away because it \u201cwastes cans.\u201d Then, when I put the fan in the trash, the cousin\u2019s wife playfully yelled at me (I don\u2019t know her well at all) even after I explained we aren\u2019t allowed to recycle cans in our town.\n\nOverall it was just kind of intense for me. We all paid equal shares to stay there so I\u2019m not sure why they thought they could run the whole thing. We were already kind of outsides, since we don\u2019t see these cousins all that often, so it was pretty uncomfortable. I will say I\u2019m very eco-conscious at home. I use all glass, we compost, and we recycle as much as possible. We have an all organic yard and wear mostly organic clothing made with fair labor practices. However, I felt annoyed because I had to play specifically by their rules, doing what they thought was important. I didn\u2019t yell at anyone else for bringing non-organic food (despite the fact that we eat organic) because I understood that we\u2019re on vacation and other families may not do things the same, so we have to bend a little.\n\nThe group is trying to plan again for this year and I told my husband I\u2019m not up for going. It was just too stressful and I would feel like I need to be so careful. He got upset with me and said that while they\u2019re annoying, it\u2019s not a big deal and I should do one weekend for him to see his extended cousins. He says I\u2019m being a bit harsh towards his cousins and making too much of this. He says he\u2019s let plenty of things roll off with my family and wishes I would do the same just for this one weekend. I will say that the cousins weren\u2019t super nice and laid around mostly watching tv instead of interacting or playing games, so the recycling thing is mainly what sticks in my head from the whole weekend since there wasn\u2019t much else. Now I\u2019m feeling guilty but still really don\u2019t want to go.

I use all glass, we compost, and we recycle as much as possible. We have an all organic yard and wear mostly organic clothing made with fair labor practices. However, I felt annoyed because I had to play specifically by their rules, doing what they thought was important. I didn\u2019t yell at anyone else for bringing non-organic food (despite the fact that we eat organic) because I understood that we\u2019re on vacation and other families may not do things the same, so we have to bend a little.\n\nThe group is trying to plan again for this year and I told my husband I\u2019m not up for going. It was just too stressful and I would feel like I need to be so careful. He got upset with me and said that while they\u2019re annoying, it\u2019s not a big deal and I should do one weekend for him to see his extended cousins. He says I\u2019m being a bit harsh towards his cousins and making too much of this. He says he\u2019s let plenty of things roll off with my family and wishes I would do the same just for this one weekend. I will say that the cousins weren\u2019t super nice and laid around mostly watching tv instead of interacting or playing games, so the recycling thing is mainly what sticks in my head from the whole weekend since there wasn\u2019t much else.
