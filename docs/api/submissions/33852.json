My answers to questions are below the original post. \n\nOG post: \n\nI (17F, soon to be 18 in January) have a sister (15F) who is disabled, she is autistic and has PTSD, depression and anxiety. As well as an illness she had as an infant that left her with a neurological condition. She has medium support needs, she can talk and walk but has trouble with social communication and sensory issues. I must make this clear that although she these conditions she has a normal intelligence (she has also been tested for LDs before and doesn't have any) and quite likes the attention she gets from her conditions. My sister has a very limited pallet and when it comes to restaurants she will only eat the following list; pizza, fish and chips, chicken nuggets/goujons and ice cream. Absolutely nothing else from a restaurant that she likes. Since she was born my whole family have made these accommodations for all celebrations. On the rare occasion my sister didn't like the restaurant we were going to she throws a tantrum and spends the whole dinner trying to ruin it. This is done by looking moody (literally frowning) and complaining to my mum that she doesn't like it and being incredibly rude to everybody there. Or if she tries the food and doesn't like it, she will throw up on the plate and quite frankly it is disgusting and puts me completely off my meal. My 18th is approaching in mid January and my family were asking about restaurants (both my mum and dad want to take me to separate dinners, they are divorced) and the usual suggestions were made of places my sister likes. The problem is I don't really like these restaurants, the food is meh and I'm sick of eating the same foods. I've never said anything about not liking them, since they are the only options my sister approved of. I really don't want to eat at these places for my 18th and I feel like it's unfair that I have to always adjust to her requirements. I asked my mum if there's any chance we could eat somewhere else for my birthday and she told me no that \"____ will not approve of a new restaurant\" haven't talked about the subject since to either my mum or dad. I'm currently feeling like I don't want to go out at all, I mean what's the point? I don't even like the restaurant and it's my birthday. WIBTA is I did choose not to?\n\nI cant reply to comments since I don't have enough karma so below is all my responses\n\n\nAm I paying? I am paying! Forgot this is important information but I am paying for it with my own money (that they gave me either for Christmas/my birthday) my mums dinner will be payed for with money that I gave her that she hasn't returned yet. If you want to be specific I am paying for \"mums\" dinner with my own money (that they didn't give me) and my \"dads\" dinner with birthday/Christmas money that they did give me. \n\nWhy am I paying? My mum owes me money and we decided that instead of her giving me it back it would just go towards my birthday dinner (so basically I'm paying). So basically I've gave her the money in advance. Since my money is in my mums possession I don't know if I'll be able to get it back and don't want it to go to waste. For my dad I thought it would be a nice gesture since he has been paying for my driving lessons. \n\nWho is going? I my mum and dad want to take me to dinner separately but both with my sister present (one with me, my mum and my sister and another with me my dad and my sister) this is usually how our dinners happen. My stepdad may also attend my mums dinner too, but we'll see. \n\nCan she stay home? They do not leave my sister at home ever, even though I am paying they will not go to a restaurant without her. mum and dad will definitely not be okay with me leaving her out, that's why I thought cancelling would be better. She comes everywhere, doctors, hairdressers EVERYWHERE. No chance they'll be okay with it.\n\nEdit about LDs: The way I've wrote this doesn't explain what I meant properly, sorry about that. I mean meant my sister does not have a intellectual disability or a learning disability (I do, dyslexia & ADHD she doesn't) \n\nTantrum vs meltdown: The reason I used the term \"tantrum\" and not \"meltdown\" is because my sister simply ruins the dinner because she doesn't like it, not because she can't sit through it. I would like to make this very clear, I would never, not in a million years make someone sit through a situation they are uncomfortable with. As someone who is neurodivergent myself, I could never, it's horrible. The reason I used this term is because my sister usually gets her way because she autistic, she has admitted to me before that she likes when people do what she wants. It's not a meltdown it's a tantrum she does it on purpose so we have to go home. The \"tantrum\" look like her insulting the whole table (\"I hate you\" \"I didn't want to come here\" \"why's she aloud to pick???\"), typically me, my mum and my gran on occasion get these type of insults. She hates when my gran comes since she can't walk far we often have to pick restaurants she likes and not my sister. And she sits there sighing and will then be in a mood all day. Trust me when I say she is aware. As for the food thing, she knows everybody hates it and it stops the meal from continuing, since typically after I've watch her chew her and spit it out I'm not really feeling hungry. She usually smirks after doing it to me and thinks it's funny when I no longer want to eat. Hopefully this explains somethings.

As a parent, I try to make sure that all of my children\u2019s needs are met, and I meet their individual wants as best as I can, but each of them feels like they get lost in the sauce from time to time, and that\u2019s the challenge of having more than one child. \n\nOn the third point, I see your point, and I see where the parents are coming from. They want to make sure the youngest isn\u2019t excluded, and that\u2019s a laudable goal, but it seems there\u2019s a communication breakdown. Seriously, both parents and OP could very easily have a single phone call and sort out which birthday dinner will be for two and which one will be for three.
