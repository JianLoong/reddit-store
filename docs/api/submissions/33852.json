{"id": 33852, "submission_id": "18s5o72", "title": "WIBTA if I cancelled my 18th birthday dinner because accommodating my autistic sister is too difficult?", "selftext": "I (17F, soon to be 18 in January) have a sister (15F) who is disabled, she is autistic and has PTSD, depression and anxiety. As well as an illness she had as an infant that left her with a neurological condition. She has medium support needs, she can talk and walk but has trouble with social communication and sensory issues. I must make this clear that although she these conditions she has a normal intelligence (she has also been tested for LDs before and doesn't have any) and quite likes the attention she gets from her conditions. My sister has a very limited pallet and when it comes to restaurants she will only eat the following list; pizza, fish and chips, chicken nuggets/goujons and ice cream. Absolutely nothing else from a restaurant that she likes. Since she was born my whole family have made these accommodations for all celebrations. On the rare occasion my sister didn't like the restaurant we were going to she throws a tantrum and spends the whole dinner trying to ruin it. This is done by looking moody (literally frowning) and complaining to my mum that she doesn't like it and being incredibly rude to everybody there. Or if she tries the food and doesn't like it, she will throw up on the plate and quite frankly it is disgusting and puts me completely off my meal. My 18th is approaching in mid January and my family were asking about restaurants (both my mum and dad want to take me to separate dinners, they are divorced) and the usual suggestions were made of places my sister likes. The problem is I don't really like these restaurants, the food is meh and I'm sick of eating the same foods. I've never said anything about not liking them, since they are the only options my sister approved of. I really don't want to eat at these places for my 18th and I feel like it's unfair that I have to always adjust to her requirements. I asked my mum if there's any chance we could eat somewhere else for my birthday and she told me no that \"____ will not approve of a new restaurant\" haven't talked about the subject since to either my mum or dad. I'm currently feeling like I don't want to go out at all, I mean what's the point? I don't even like the restaurant and it's my birthday. WIBTA is I did choose not to?\n\nI cant reply to comments since I don't have enough karma so below is all my responses.\n\nEdit 1: I am paying! Forgot this is important information but I am paying for it with my birthday money (that they gave me). I would be part of what my money is spent on, 2 dinners. \n\nEdit 2: I my mum and dad want to take me to dinner separately but both with my sister present (one with me, my mum and my sister and another with me my dad and my sister) this is usually how our dinners happen. \n\nEdit 3: They do not leave my sister at home ever, even though I am paying they will not go to a restaurant without her. \n\nEdit 4: hello again! The way I've wrote this doesn't explain what I meant properly, sorry about that. I mean meant my sister does not have a intellectual disability or a learning disability (I do, dyslexia & ADHD she doesn't) \n\nEdit 5: the reason I used the term \"tantrum\" and not \"meltdown\" is because my sister simply ruins the dinner because she doesn't like it, not because she can't sit through it. I would like to make this very clear, I would never, not in a million years make someone sit through a situation they are uncomfortable with. As someone who is neurodivergent myself, I could never, it's horrible. The reason I used this term is because my sister usually gets her way because she autistic, she has admitted to me before that she likes when people do what she wants. It's not a meltdown it's a tantrum she does it on purpose so we have to go home. The \"tantrum\" look like her insulting the whole table (\"I hate you\" \"I didn't want to come here\" \"why's she aloud to pick???\"), typically me, my mum and my gran on occasion get these type of insults. She hates when my gran comes since she can't walk far we often have to pick restaurants she likes and not my sister. And she sits there sighing and will then be in a mood all day. Trust me when I say she is aware. As for the food thing, she knows everybody hates it and it stops the meal from continuing, since typically after I've watch her chew her and spit it out I'm not really feeling hungry. She usually smirks after doing it to me and thinks it's funny when I no longer want to eat. Hopefully this explains somethings. \n\n", "created_utc": 1703697236, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18s5o72/wibta_if_i_cancelled_my_18th_birthday_dinner/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
