She doesn\u2019t pay for anything else: bills, utilities, etc.\n\nTwo weeks ago, after having an argument with our mother and I over not helping pay for other utilities, cleaning up messes, generally being a not great roommate, my sister left the apartment and went to visit her boyfriend (19M) at the bakery where he works.\n\nHe and I have had disagreements in the past about him smoking (not tobacco) in our apartment, which puts me at risk for eviction, and over him leaving messes and trash around when he comes to visit (where he normally stays for a few days at a time). \n\nAfter this disagreement, however, I received a text from him after midnight telling me that I needed to call him to talk.

Not all of us make the best decisions at 19. However, the guy she's dating sounds dangerous and abusive. I would even consider going to the landlord or property manager over this and have said bf banned from the premises.
