She doesn\u2019t pay for anything else: bills, utilities, etc.\n\nTwo weeks ago, after having an argument with our mother and I over not helping pay for other utilities, cleaning up messes, generally being a not great roommate, my sister left the apartment and went to visit her boyfriend (19M) at the bakery where he works.\n\nHe and I have had disagreements in the past about him smoking (not tobacco) in our apartment, which puts me at risk for eviction, and over him leaving messes and trash around when he comes to visit (where he normally stays for a few days at a time). \n\nAfter this disagreement, however, I received a text from him after midnight telling me that I needed to call him to talk. I didn\u2019t answer, because I was upset myself and I\u2019ve not one to be confrontational, especially when I\u2019m not calm. \n\nHe arrived at my apartment with my sister. It was after 1 AM at this point. I was in bed, lights off, in pajamas, when he began pounding on my door. Before I even answered he opened it and was in my room, yelling at me about letting my mom come between me and my sister. \n\nI was already shaken at that point (my door doesn\u2019t lock so I was already very caught off guard) and I was scared. I told him that it was something between my mom, my sister, and myself. Not him.\n\nHe stormed into my room and tossed his key that my sister had given to him onto my nightstand, told me to \u201chave a nice effing life\u201d and slammed my door shut again before I could even answer.\n\nI told my sister I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with him coming to our apartment anymore. It\u2019s been a week, and she and I just had our first fight about it tonight. I held my ground and said I didn\u2019t want him over, she says I\u2019m irrational and being selfish, and that I\u2019m destroying her mental health by banning him, but I really don\u2019t feel comfortable and technically (and legally) it IS my apartment. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673155229, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106aq6p/aita_for_banning_my_sisters_boyfriend_from_our/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if there wasn\u2019t a problem between you and the boyfriend, that is your house. And you can allow or ban whoever you want to from your home.

I still love her. I told her I wouldn\u2019t just abandon her or throw her out on the street, but I know she\u2019d either have to move in with her dad almost an hour away because she can\u2019t afford a place of her own. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just feeling torn between giving in so I know she\u2019ll be safe and housed, or standing my ground and being another person that turned their back on her.", "NTA, this man is bold asf for walking into YOUR apartment, pounding on your bedroom door at 1am in the morning and then screaming at you. That is unacceptable, entitled, and aggressive behavior from someone that doesn\u2019t live there and doesn\u2019t pay rent.

Nah kick him out and get a restraining order at the same time", "NTA - I agree with pretty much everyone's comments. File a restraining order against him and kick your sister out! She allowed dude to threaten you in your own home! Time to go!", "NTA, kick them both out, he's already violent and you don't want to be on the receiving end of it. Make sure you have other people around (friends?) when they move out. You can probably advertise for a house mate to help with the rent. \n\nOtherwise - hire a big buff actor to do the exact same thing to her and see how she likes being threatened in her own home. (This would definitely be an AH move though) \n\nIf you can't get out of this situation and if your state permits it maybe get a gun license and learn how to shoot - this situation doesn't sound safe for you.", "Can we also talk about just kicking sister out? Sounds like she needs to lear some life lessons.", "There is nothing wrong with allowing her to live with you, but she needs to understand that his conduct is unacceptable and therefore he is not welcome in your home. If she chooses to move out and live with him then that\u2019s her decision, but I would make it clear she can always come back. Also if she does move out I\u2019m sure you could find someone who will pay half the rent and utilities also."]}
