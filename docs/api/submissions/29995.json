This doesn\u2019t sound like a friendship. She sounds traumatized and very emotionally needy. Her off/on modes are red flags, it\u2019s a wee borderline.\nI feel sorry for her.\nBut pity is not friendship, and it sounds as if she\u2019s dumping on you a bit. You might listen to her\u2026 if she has something healthy to say, then it\u2019s fine to express support, happiness to hear she xyz. If she starts the trauma count, then say \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, would you excuse me?\u201d and get away.

If she wants to have an adult relationship with a coworker, then she needs to figure out how to bounce back from them. I would steer clear of her.

It\u2019s a stupid cycle and people don\u2019t like hearing the harsh truth. You might want to take a different approach. You listen because you care. Not because you expect her to be sensible.
