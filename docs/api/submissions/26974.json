NTA", "please leave him OP, hes a weirdo for getting angry", "NTA. His feelings were probably just hurt by the wincing. He probably feels like you hate his french toast rather than simply being tired of eating it. My husband makes the grossest eggs and toast I've ever had, but he keeps making it for me because I act like I like it (I sneak and feed it to the dog or say I'm taking it to work with me and then I throw it away somewhere). Started telling him I wanted a break from eggs since I've eaten it a lot. He hasn't made me breakfast since, but that's mainly because the only breakfast foods we ever have on hand is eggs and bread. Sometimes he goes to make himself eggs and toast and then I'll say I want some too, but I want scrambled instead so I'll make it myself. Then we cook together and it's fun and I get breakfast that isn't gross and his feelings are spared. Sorry, went on a tangent there. Maybe you guys could make breakfast together Sometimes? Like, he could make French toast for you guys, but you make Other stuff to go with it that you do want.", "NTA... You were going to make your own breakfast, that's not rude.

I can see the wince thing as not being super nice, it was more a reaction then anything. \n\nI'm more upset at the storming off, telling me hours later that I was super rude and that he isn't my servant (which BTW I already know that). It just feels so blown out of proportion.", "Some days it is normal for him to be touchy and other days not. Yeah, I get the wince but it was a natural reaction. I said he is welcome to make that and I would so something different but that wasn't apparently the right thing to say to smooth things over.", "Frankly the fact you were already MAKING your own...he comes in and tries to TELL you that you are having French toast....is insane to me.

Tell him you appreciate the consideration when he does make something to share or something for you but you're just not a fan after eating it pretty frequently lately. Not everyone was raised on the same food. I grew up mostly cooking breakfast for myself or having pop tarts or eggs/bacon/salted ham etc.\nYou where already prepping your own.\nHe can't dictate what you eat.\nAlso why is he cooking for you as a kind gesture, not eating and not willing to consider what you'd like to eat? Everyone gets cravings and their body tells them what nutritional input it needs. Anyways. Nta. He kinda is for having a childish reaction to it and I don't think he's treating you okay and that should be addressed tbh because you shouldn't be lashed out at.", "Maybe he took that as an insult that you think his FT sucks?", "I can't say anything to my partner about his cooking. Even if is raw I just keep my mouth shut and pretend I don't mind throwing a $30 roast in to the bin. It is just easier.

To me, preparing to make breakfast would mean ingredients on the counter or pan on the hob or plates taken out or a cereal bowl and the milk next to each other. There would be signs basically. So if that\u2019s what you mean - it\u2019s really, really weird that he should walk in and start making you breakfast. Did you wake up at the same time - did he know you hadn\u2019t eaten yet?\n\nI completely understand not wanting to eat something on the day, especially if you have it often. I also think that if you\u2019re cooking for someone it\u2019s best to ask what they want or tell them what you were thinking of making. You\u2019re not exactly cooking for someone if you make food they don\u2019t want. I wouldn\u2019t like my partner to eat my food out of obligation or guilt - I want him to enjoy it. \n\nIt sounds like he noticed the wince, and that he thought you were criticising his cooking instead of just saying you\u2019d like a change. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have assumed you were giving him a food order, like he was a chef, I think the wince probably made him think you were criticising him. I think he overreacted, you didn\u2019t get a chance to explain, and he\u2019s still angry now. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA but I think you do need to talk to him. Be calm, tell him you love his French toast but wanted a change, and that didn\u2019t mean you expected him to make it. If he can\u2019t accept that or is still angry - this might be a bigger issue than breakfast. \n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat French toast as often as you, it would be too rich!", "It sounds unhinged.", "Yeah but your wince suggested that you assumed that now you'd be eating what he makes instead of continuing to make what you'd planned to.  \n\nYou ask if he's thinking french toast, he says yes.  You now say \"Nice!  I'm making an omelette\" (or whatever) as you go for the items you need.\n\nSaying he was welcome to make it after the fact wasn't *ever* going to go as well as something more like the conversation I mentioned (dinner convos often go like that in my house ha ha) or the one ThisWillAgeWell did.", "Which is crazy since he makes it a lot and I was always eat it and say thank you.", "But it is now implied you only tolerated it to be polite. He sounds hurt but I also understand the flip side of that right. I also understand inadvertently making a face and would say you didn't mean to.", "NAH I feel like this is a misunderstanding. He's nice to offer to cook breakfast for you, but you want to be able to say no occasionally without it being a blowup. Maybe you two need to start alternating days you prepare breakfast, or he should ask if you want any before he prepares anything for you. But I do feel like this can be solved with a conversation.\n\nHowever if that conversation involves OP never cooking and expecting to \"have a say\" in what BF cooks/shares I'd have a very different judgement.", ">He said that he is not my f$&%ing servant and breakfast isn't made to order\n\nOk but you didn't order him to make you breakfast he decided on his own to head into the kitchen and make french toast.

I avoid those foods now.", "ESH: More on you than him. Why don\u2019t you offer to make breakfast for both of you more often if you don\u2019t like what he is making? Like on this morning.\n\nHe overreacted, but it can be really frustrating when you do all the cooking and someone complains about what you\u2019re making. He should have used his words more effectively to express this to you. However, it does seem like you\u2019re acting more like the victim than he is, you too could\u2019ve used your words rather than wincing that he had the audacity to make you breakfast. He is right, he\u2019s not a short order cook and when cooking at home what gets made is dependent on the ingredients in the fridge and what time you have to make something. \n\nYou both need to do better communicating to one another what you want and need.", "Why don't you make a breakfast for both of you as a \"solution\" instead of hiding the problem, and then making breaky for yourself only?\n\nNTA. but handled poorly", "INFO - OP do you ever make breakfast? You say he does most of the cooking.

Would you like _____?\u201d Now you\u2019re not \u201cinsulting\u201d his cooking.

But you were already making something, so totally appropriate to express that you didn't want what he was planning to cook. \n\nI do wonder why you were making breakfast for just yourself? If he is usually cooking, why wouldn't you offer to cook for him when you are already making something. \n\nThis may just all be about communication, so maybe a better approach (hindsight doesn't make you an AH in the moment), could have been \"morning, I'm already making some food and was thinking I could make you X if you want?\" That way, you are offering up an alternative and offering to cook.", "NTA if these are the accurate details.
