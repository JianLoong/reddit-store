He was genuinely hurt and upset that I didn\u2019t love it as much as he did.  Cooking for someone else is a nice thing to do, but only if the other person actually enjoys what you\u2019ve cooked - and you do cook other things\u2026.", "NTA but it sound like making breakfast for you is part of his love language and he didn\u2019t know how to express that he was hurt you didn\u2019t like his go to dish.

It implies you don't like his French toast, and perhaps that's what he took offense at. Or perhaps he interpreted it as you expecting **him** to make something different for you.\n\nIt might have been better simply to say \"I love French toast, but we've had it a lot recently, and I've really got a craving for oatmeal today. Do you want me to make you some? No? That's fine. You make French toast for yourself, and I'll make oatmeal for me.\"", "NTA. He's being weird.

Brioche French Toast, with strawberries, bacon and maple syrup - we make the Brioche from scratch, totally delicious.", "You did not ask him to DO sth. You actually ask him to NOT do it, since you were already preparing your (and his) breakfast?\n\nDoes he feel not appreciated enough for doing all the cooking? Sounds a bit dramatic for this one incident, so maybe he feels it\u2019s not getting noticed enough in general what he does.", "NAH\n\nhe was being a little over sensitive, but you could have said it better (and maybe not winced) . What about saying, \u201cfor a change I\u2019m going to make the breakfast this morning, I\u2019m making\u2026..\u201d\n\nTry thinking if the roles were reversed, how would you feel", "However, after reading the comments you made as well, I have to say NAH, as it's clearly a misunderstanding.

I cook as well, if my wife does not want it she makes her own meal.", "NTA - can't blame you a bit; he woke up cranky.", "YTA not for not wantijg french toast but for how you went about it. I think you could've been more polite and kind. Why did you have to wince...don't you realize that is a bit hurtful? You could've simply said \"I thought I'll make something different today\" or \"I thought I'd make breakfast today\" or you could've said the night before \"hey I love your French toast but it's not something I like to eat too frequently\".", "NTA.

It kinda sounds like it\u2019s a love language thing he does for you and he\u2019s not feeling appreciated for it.", "ESH. Why'd he say he wasnt your chef and storm off? It seems like youre downplaying your role in this situation. Is he still okay with cooking or feeling unappreciated because he cookes even if he isnt eating? You two should have a conversation and maybe discuss the cooking arrangement", "Your partner overreacted to what you said.  I kind of wonder if the french toast is really the issue.  NTA", "please leave him OP, hes a weirdo for getting angry", "NTA. His feelings were probably just hurt by the wincing. He probably feels like you hate his french toast rather than simply being tired of eating it. My husband makes the grossest eggs and toast I've ever had, but he keeps making it for me because I act like I like it (I sneak and feed it to the dog or say I'm taking it to work with me and then I throw it away somewhere). Started telling him I wanted a break from eggs since I've eaten it a lot. He hasn't made me breakfast since, but that's mainly because the only breakfast foods we ever have on hand is eggs and bread. Sometimes he goes to make himself eggs and toast and then I'll say I want some too, but I want scrambled instead so I'll make it myself. Then we cook together and it's fun and I get breakfast that isn't gross and his feelings are spared. Sorry, went on a tangent there. Maybe you guys could make breakfast together Sometimes? Like, he could make French toast for you guys, but you make Other stuff to go with it that you do want.", "NTA... You were going to make your own breakfast, that's not rude. (If he had already made it, then it's a bit rude)", "Haha, yes.", "Im pretty sure this is the crux. I dont think he knew OP was and felt like OP was saying \"No make something else\"\n\nSounds to me like a little bit of a misunderstanding.", "I definitly tried to transcribe it the way it went down. He said me wincing was the super rude part.", "I hadn't started to make anything yet, was just in the kitchen getting ready to", "I imagine it was out of anger/frustration.", "I hadn't started cooking but I was in the kitchen getting ready to when he came down to prepare French toast. It was a wince of not wanting that for breakfast. I can see the wince thing as not being super nice, it was more a reaction then anything. \n\nI'm more upset at the storming off, telling me hours later that I was super rude and that he isn't my servant (which BTW I already know that). It just feels so blown out of proportion.", "Some days it is normal for him to be touchy and other days not. Yeah, I get the wince but it was a natural reaction. I said he is welcome to make that and I would so something different but that wasn't apparently the right thing to say to smooth things over.", "Frankly the fact you were already MAKING your own...he comes in and tries to TELL you that you are having French toast....is insane to me. How dare you don't eat what I'm telling you. I'd be like I frickin was if you bothered to open your eyes. Dude is obsessed with French Toast", "Exactly. Tell him you appreciate the consideration when he does make something to share or something for you but you're just not a fan after eating it pretty frequently lately. Not everyone was raised on the same food. I grew up mostly cooking breakfast for myself or having pop tarts or eggs/bacon/salted ham etc.\nYou where already prepping your own.\nHe can't dictate what you eat.\nAlso why is he cooking for you as a kind gesture, not eating and not willing to consider what you'd like to eat? Everyone gets cravings and their body tells them what nutritional input it needs. Anyways. Nta. He kinda is for having a childish reaction to it and I don't think he's treating you okay and that should be addressed tbh because you shouldn't be lashed out at.", "Maybe he took that as an insult that you think his FT sucks?", "I can't say anything to my partner about his cooking. Even if is raw I just keep my mouth shut and pretend I don't mind throwing a $30 roast in to the bin. It is just easier. Some men seem to think they deserve a medal for participation.", "I don\u2019t think YTA but could you not have just said the night before \u201cI\u2019m getting a bit sick of French toast, I might make something different tomorrow if you want anything\u201d. It sounds like you know this is a pattern?\n\nI think it\u2019s a little bit rude to wince if you haven\u2019t expressed you want something else tbh", "Was it\u2019s obvious you were preparing to make your breakfast or could it have looked like you were just getting a glass of water or similar? To me, preparing to make breakfast would mean ingredients on the counter or pan on the hob or plates taken out or a cereal bowl and the milk next to each other. There would be signs basically. So if that\u2019s what you mean - it\u2019s really, really weird that he should walk in and start making you breakfast. Did you wake up at the same time - did he know you hadn\u2019t eaten yet?\n\nI completely understand not wanting to eat something on the day, especially if you have it often. I also think that if you\u2019re cooking for someone it\u2019s best to ask what they want or tell them what you were thinking of making. You\u2019re not exactly cooking for someone if you make food they don\u2019t want. I wouldn\u2019t like my partner to eat my food out of obligation or guilt - I want him to enjoy it. \n\nIt sounds like he noticed the wince, and that he thought you were criticising his cooking instead of just saying you\u2019d like a change. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have assumed you were giving him a food order, like he was a chef, I think the wince probably made him think you were criticising him. I think he overreacted, you didn\u2019t get a chance to explain, and he\u2019s still angry now. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA but I think you do need to talk to him. Be calm, tell him you love his French toast but wanted a change, and that didn\u2019t mean you expected him to make it. If he can\u2019t accept that or is still angry - this might be a bigger issue than breakfast. \n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat French toast as often as you, it would be too rich!", "It sounds unhinged.", "Yeah but your wince suggested that you assumed that now you'd be eating what he makes instead of continuing to make what you'd planned to.  \n\nYou ask if he's thinking french toast, he says yes.  You now say \"Nice!  I'm making an omelette\" (or whatever) as you go for the items you need.\n\nSaying he was welcome to make it after the fact wasn't *ever* going to go as well as something more like the conversation I mentioned (dinner convos often go like that in my house ha ha) or the one ThisWillAgeWell did.", "Which is crazy since he makes it a lot and I was always eat it and say thank you.", "But it is now implied you only tolerated it to be polite. He sounds hurt but I also understand the flip side of that right. I also understand inadvertently making a face and would say you didn't mean to."]}
