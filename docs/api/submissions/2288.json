I feel like I have never heard of that usually one child inherits the house.\n\nI think that\u2019s crazy we are family and I have three kids and a wife to provide for and she is using our mother death as a payday. There\u2019s no way I could afford to give her that much and she knows it.\n\nNow she wants to sell the house and split the money from it. My wife and I think she is being beyond selfish and putting money above family and being an all around brat. Now she is demanding i decide what I want to do with the house but I\u2019m not budging. When she wants to grow up and put family before money we can talk.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s with adding my mother put all her jewelry in a safety deposit box years ago  and had my sister and herself on as people who could access it so my sister is getting all her jewelry.

What does the will say? It\u2019s very typical for property to be spilt and one party buy out the other party. That\u2019s not strange at all. \n\nYou say your sister is just looking for a payday. But if you get the house, that\u2019s way more valuable than cash. You\u2019re asking to get 100% while she gets 0%. How is that fair?", "YTA \n\nIf there\u2019s no will then the estate is split between the children if there\u2019s no surviving spouse.\n\nWhy does your decision to pop out kids mean she doesn\u2019t get her share? Buy her out if you want it and if you can\u2019t then sell it.", "YTA.  She offered you a fair deal, to be bought out of the interest.\n\nYou\u2019re letting money and entitlement come between family; not her.\n\nJust because you have kids doesn\u2019t give you some sort of dibs on the house.\n\nOffer her half of the value, or continue being an entitled AH.", "Actually, selling the house and splitting the proceeds is what usually happens in situations like this.   Sorry, the idea of sister gifting you the house is not a fair result to your dilemma.", "YTA, you're not entitled to have the house just because you have kids, that's not how inheritance works. You either buy her out or sell the house and split the money. You can use whatever money you make from the sell to buy your family a home in the future. Also apologize to your sister, because she's being totally reasonable and you're the only AH here.", "YTA\n\nSorry, that's just not how it works. If you want the house, you owe her half of the value of said house. You've never heard of that?!? Children have been dividing up lost parents for decades.  The only way things change is if your mother had some sort of directive in writing. \n\nHere's the deal. If your sister is \"selfish\" because she wants to sell the house and split the profits, what does that make you for thinking you deserve the house and she gets nothing????????????????? You're especially out of line because of the \"I'm not budging\" shit. I think you're the one that needs to do the growing up. Her two options are literally the only fair choices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's recap:\n\nYour mom died and you think you deserve the house cause you have kids and your sister gets nothing. You think she's being \"selfish\" for wanting to SPLIT THE PROFITS from selling the house or you give her HALF the value of the house...... Think about that for a minute", "\"My wife and I think she is being beyond selfish and putting money above family \"\n\nIsn't that what you're doing?\n\nOne sibling getting the house, if it's to be split between them and the other sibling being paid half the price of it is extremely common.\n\n\"being an all around brat\"\n\nShe isn't, she's actually being very pragmatic.  You need to see it from her point of view.  \n\nYTA", "YTA.  And apparently YTA from another planet\n\n\"I feel like I have never heard of that usually one child inherits the house.\"\n\nOnly if the other children inherit something of equal value.\n\nIf there's a will, you abide by the instructions in the will.  PERIOD.  If there's not a will, then the estate is split equally among heirs.  That would be half the estate to you, and half the estate to your sister.  \n\nIf the estate only consists of one plot of land (plus improvements, usually referred to as \"a house\") then the common way to settle the matter is that the house is sold by a trustee (usually appointed by the court) and then the proceeds of the sale of the real estate parcel is divided up equally among the heirs.\n\nYour sister suggesting that you should pay her for half the house is a reasonable suggestion.  If you want the house, buy it.  Because your sister owns half of it.  You expect her to donate half a house to you, just because you are family?  \n\nOK, so what are you going to do for her in return?  Or is this love of family only OK if she's the one putting family before money while you yourself put money before family?", "YTA. Either sell the house, split the money and put it towards a new place for your family, or buy out your sister's half of it. She owns half of it and you have zero rights to demand any of her half from her no matter how many children you have. When you come to your senses about all of this, you owe her an apology too", "YTA - your sister's solution (of selling the house and splitting it halfway) sounds completely fair to me. \n\nExpecting to get the entire house, while your sister gets nothing, just sounds entitled.", "Yta unless your mom specified in a will, the house is both of yours. Just because you had kids doesn\u2019t make you more deserving.", "YTA. I don't know where you live but in my country, it should go exactly the way your sister suggests. You both inherited the house, therefore it must be split between the two of you. Either one of you buys out the other (with half the value of the house) or you sell the house together and both get half.", "YTA.\nI'm just imagining your sister's side of this.\n\"My sibling thinks that just because they have kids and I don't I should forfeit any rights to my late mother's estate\"\nYou're totally TA, why would you even think this is OK?", "YTA. \n\nIt's normal for property to be split between children. If anything your reasoning shows that you are in fact the one being selfish, expecting that you should get the house because you have children, it doesn't work like that. Your sister has as much right to the house as you and it is only right that she gets her fair share of inheritance.", "YTA. So you want your sister to just GIVE you the house and get nothing from this at all, because you have a family and she doesn't? You are beyond selfish and entitled here. Either sell and split the profits or buy the half from her. You did not inherit the house on your own and therefore have to share. You are the one who needs to grow up!", "YTA\n\nMy late Aunt left her house to 3 people. 50% to her sister and 25% to both me and my Dad. \n\nThis is normal, splitting up property between family members either leaving a house to many people or leaving a house to one and money to another.\n\nIt is the late person's choice how they left their assets.", "YTA - Effing entitled. You having kids doesn't change inheritance laws.", "YTA. The property belongs to both of you, right? You don't get a priority claim just because you have kids. If you want the house to yourself, your sibling has every right to expect compensation for their half of the property. This is very common, and rarely does just one sibling solely inherit a property. (My dad's estate will be sold and divided between me and three siblings.) You are being selfish in thinking only you deserve the house and fuck your sister.  Did you forget she is also your family?\n\nSell the house, you each take 50% of the profits, and put your share toward a new home.", "YTA. She's not the one using your mother's death as pay day, you are. Her compromise is perfectly reasonable. Are you a man, by any chance?", "YTA\n\nThe house is just one (maybe the biggest) asset of your mother's estate.  Your mother's estate would be distributed to her heirs based on your mother's will and/or area laws.  Unless your mother specified that you alone should receive her home, you and your sister should review equal amounts of assets from the estate.  If your mother had cash or other assets that equal the value of the house, you could ask if your sister is willing to accept those other assets and you take the house.  But if the house is worth far more than any other assets, the only way for your sister to get her share of the estate would be for someone to buy her out of her interest in the house.\n\nSo, no, you can't just be given a whole house.  Half the house is your sister's.  And she won't want to own a house with you.  Get a mortgage and buy her out of her interest in the house or sell the house and take your share of the money to buy something you can afford.\n\nAlso... In most places in the US, if you keep an inheritance in just your name, it isn't legally marital property.  So, consider never comingling your inheritance in case of divorce later.", "YTA....this smells like entitlement on your part.  You can take the house but you need to pay your sister half the value.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get more rights over something just because you have kids. If you mum didn\u2019t have a will, then surely her estate I\u2019ll be shared equally between you and your sister. Stop being so entitled", "YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I think because I have a family and   \nshe doesn\u2019t I should get the house. She is fine with me getting the   \nhouse but wants me to pay her for her half? I feel like I have never   \nheard of that usually one child inherits the house.\n\nOMG, you're kidding, right? No, real estate and property doesn't usually go to one heir. \n\nAnd the whole *sister is using our mother's death as a payday?* Dude, project much? Because that's **exactly** what you're trying to do. You want the entire house free and clear and don't want to see your sibling as an equal. You are the greedy one here. The amount of kids you have has no bearing on the fact that she's your sister and deserves 50/50 split on everything with you. You are trying to take more than your fair share. \n\nWhat you should do if you both can't come to an agreement for you to pay her half of the value of the house (take out a loan?) is to sell the house outright, split the proceeds, and then you can go find your own house and put that money into it as a downpayment and get a less $$ mortgage (depending). \n\nSibling could force a sale, or y'all can spend more money getting a mediator or lawyers involved to talk sense into you, but that's really your best option.", "YTA. The house being split between siblings is the normal, not just one getting it. In the cases of one sibling getting it it\u2019s because they bought out the other sibling(s) exactly as your sister is suggesting. You and your wife are being the entitles brats in this situation, not your sister.\nGet the house appraised, figure out what half would be. Get the jewelry appraised, deduct half of that amount from what you are paying her for her half of the house.\n\nTa-da", "YTA\n\nYou are so wrong!! Even if sister was single and owned her own home which was worth more than mothers house she is still entitled to her inheritance from her mother i.e. portion of the house. Probably better off selling the house and splitting the money.", "YTA if you think you should get the whole house and she should get nothing. Just because you crapped out some kids doesn't mean she gets written out of the will. If the house isn't left to anyone you need to come to an equitable solution, not hoover all the leavings and tell your sister to pound sand.", "YTA its the most fair way to split inheritance, its 50/50.", "YTA. Since mom died without a will, her estate belongs to both of you. If you want the house, you need to buy her out. Or, do what she suggested and sell the house and split the proceeds. That is the way things are normally done. I would also tell her that she needs to inventory the jewelry, get it appraised, and give you half the amount. Contact a probate attorney for legal advice.", "YTA wow entitled much, its actually the common standard to buy the other one out if one wants to live in the property\n\n You and your spouse are the ones needing to grow up\n\nYour children dont make you more important", "YTA.\n\nWhat is the full value of the estate including the house (not including any work needing doing). You are both entitled to 50% of that after paying off any outstanding debts.\n\nYes, buy her half of the house if you wish or you have to sell the house and split the proceeds. \n\nDo you really want to cause so much issue, you never speak to your Sister for the next 40 years?", "YTA. Stop using your children as an excuse for your greed.", "YTA, massively. Why should you get the most valuable asset just because you bred faster than your sister did? She is being very reasonable, if you want that specific house then pay her half share of it  or seel it and with your half you can get a bigger place. Your entitlement is off the charts.", "YTA. It is not being selfish, it is the law. You both are entitled to 50%. That's it. You having kids doesn't change this fact and gets you exactly ZERO in terms of inheritance.", "Wtf ofc YTA. Your sister is right. Sell it and split or the one that move s in pays the other half the amount of the value of the house. Some jewellery went to your sister as sentimental value as she will wear them. Stop being entitled.", "Sorry for your loss\n\nThis is a no-brainer. With no legal will, you and your sister inherit half of the estate each. You can keep the house if you buy out your sister, or the house is sold and profits split equally.\n\nYou might *need* the house more because you have kids, but you don't *deserve* it more. Your sister lost just as much mum as you did\n\nYTA", "YTA - You'll get what you'll get, it isn't up to the pair of you to decide it will be done according to your mother's will, and if she didn't have one then someone else will decide how it is shared equally between NoK.\n\nIt's absolutely ludicrous of you to believe that she shouldn't be entitled to any inheritance because you *chose* to have children.\n\nI take it that in your book all infertile people are automatically disqualified form ever inheriting anything?", "YTA. The right thing to do is split the inheritance evenly rather than using your family as a weapon to cut your poor sister out of her fair share. It's not your sisters fault you can't afford your own house... Pff", "Yup YTA. Splitting assets is the norm, if you can\u2019t afford to buy her out then sell and split the money. I can\u2019t fathom why you would think otherwise.", "YTA. Saying that She is making a pay day out of your mothers death when it You who expects her to just Give you a huge part of her inheritance is hilarious.", "YTA It is normal for all the kids of the deceased to inherit an equal share of their possessions. She's in the right, you owe her half the house (minus the price of the jewelry) if you want to keep it and if you can't afford it, I'm afraid you'll have to sell.", "YTA, how is she being selfish? She is entitled to half the house, you having kids has nothing to do with this. You are the one putting money first, not her!", "YTA - if the house belongs to both of you as a shared inheritance, this could go one of 3 ways. She buys you out, you buy her out or you both sell to someone else and split the sale. That\u2019s it. \n\nIt\u2019s actually very common for a house to be inherited by all the children. This way it\u2019s fair and evenly split. \n\nWhy should she give you her half of her inheritance because of your life choices?", "YTA. You are also putting money above your family. It\u2019s a house, sell it and buy your own with your half. You both deserve a house and access to financial stability because that\u2019s what your mom would have wanted, otherwise she would have written it in for you to have solely. The kids have nothing to do with it. I suspect if you both had children you\u2019d still be arguing over the house. Just sell it, it\u2019s not worth destroying your relationship with your family over an asset.", "YTA - it\u2019s very typical that unless otherwise stated in a legal document that siblings sell the house and split the profits equally", "Except in aristocracy when the family mansion goes to the first son I have never heard of a house not being split amongst kids ! She will get a lawyer and it will be sold so beware.", "YTA\n\nWhen she wants to put family above money? I think you need to re-read what you wrote.\n\nYou and your wife are putting money above what\u2019s fair and family. \n\nJFC your mother died only a few weeks ago.", "\n>I feel like I have never heard of that usually one child inherits the house.\n\nGet to fuck.  \ud83e\udd23 \n\nYTA and are either incredibly ignorant or hugely disingenuous here. \n\nYou have 2 options:\n\n- One of you buys the other other out \n\n- you sell and split the proceeds.\n\n>My wife and I think she is being beyond selfish and putting money above family and being an all around brat.\n\nYou're trying to steal half a fucking house.\n\n>When she wants to grow up and put family before money we can talk.\n\nAgain, you are trying to steal half a house.

YOUR ENTITLED & SHES CORRECT... appraise the house then pay her the half. coz both of you has the rights for ownership. It only be yours if your parents or your mother put your name on the will stating the house is yours.", "YTA, your mom knew you would do something like this so she gave your sister the jewelry ahead of time", "Wtf is wrong with you? Big YTA. You aren't entitled to a whole house and leaving your sister jack shit cause you CHOSE to have children. Unless the jewellery is like Elizabeth Taylor's collection idk how you would think that's reasonable. You split the house 50/50, your sister gets to keep the jewellery unless you have daughters. (I kept all my grandma's not particularly valuable jewellery when she died as I only have male cousins and my dad only has a brother - if I die without children it will go to my second cousins as the nearest female relatives - don't sell heirlooms unless you have to).\n\nAlso your mum is TA for not having a will.", "Usually one child inherits the house? What a pack of crap. If that was what your mother wanted she would have put it in her will. I am assuming the reading of the will, will make her intentions clear.

YTA", "YTA,\n\nHaving kids doesn\u2019t make you more deserving of the house you both have a legal share in.\n\nBuying her out would be cheaper then buying your own house.\n\nOr you both sell the house and split the profits.\n\nYou are the one trying to bully your sister out of her inheritance so you get to keep everything.
