She could have worded it differently like being worried about their health and activity level. \nI feel that it is important to address these issues without causing upset and insecurities. \nYou might be a little bit not great for allowing unhealthy habits or for them to get to this point. I (31F) was a big girl as a teen and I wished my parents helped rather than prioritising work/school (they were workaholic?? teachers, I myself was still at school so their world and by extention mine was all about school)  over literally everything including our health. To top it I have PCOS & insulin resistance  so I gain weight easier than I loose it, have mental health issues so can switch between comfort eating to deciding my self worth is tied up in my body which I think is disgusting then just not eating. We don't want this to happen with your girls.\nSo my unsolicited advice is to keep your girls away from mean comments, make sure there is no mental health issues or medical issue causing this (thyroid issues, Pcos & insulin resistance can be genetic down the female line) and just encourage healthy eating habits and exercise - maybe fun family hikes, camping, climbing to encourage a start?", "Im sure you\u2019re a loving father.

Someone else commented earlier that for this age, your daughter's should be the best physical shape of their life, and they arent wrong.The death of their mother aside, the stress that college brings, and getting older don't make health and fitness easier. Once you are heavily overweight or obese, your body carries those fat cells forever, even if you lose weight and they shrink.

What it does seem like, though, is that you mixed up the words and are trying to save face.", "How do you think this is going to improve?\n\nIf you keep at it, they will become healthier & lose weight and get less winded/be able to enjoy longer walks.\n\nIf you do nothing they will be red faced & winded from climbing a flight of stairs. No otherwise healthy child should be in that position.\n\nIf you help them deal with this now you can avoid all the extra health issues that come from being that overweight, poor joints, circulation etc - if you leave it, this is only going to get worse.\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with my weight for the last few years, it goes up & down a bit still but I\u2019m broadly where I want to be primarily through diet & walking.\n\nUse an Apple Watch (or similar) & MyFitnessPal-  or whatever is in your country that is good for counting calories & aim to burn about 1000 more calories a day than you consume & within a few months things will start to improve fairly quickly.", "So you blew off the doctor's advice because they complained?
