They could develop serious issues  because of this, like diabetes, liver problems, etc. She should definitely apologize to you because of her comments, she was a big AH but she was right as well.", "Buddy, people have no doubt been tactfully trying to discuss this with you for years and nothing has changed. This time you actually heard what she said. I'm sorry for your loss but that doesn't mean you get to ignore reality. \n\nI'm 5'6\" and I don't exercise and eat candy and cheese every day.

She could have worded it differently like being worried about their health and activity level. \nI feel that it is important to address these issues without causing upset and insecurities. \nYou might be a little bit not great for allowing unhealthy habits or for them to get to this point. I (31F) was a big girl as a teen and I wished my parents helped rather than prioritising work/school (they were workaholic?? teachers, I myself was still at school so their world and by extention mine was all about school)  over literally everything including our health. To top it I have PCOS & insulin resistance  so I gain weight easier than I loose it, have mental health issues so can switch between comfort eating to deciding my self worth is tied up in my body which I think is disgusting then just not eating. We don't want this to happen with your girls.\nSo my unsolicited advice is to keep your girls away from mean comments, make sure there is no mental health issues or medical issue causing this (thyroid issues, Pcos & insulin resistance can be genetic down the female line) and just encourage healthy eating habits and exercise - maybe fun family hikes, camping, climbing to encourage a start?", "Im sure you\u2019re a loving father.

In fact, the right thing to do is often painful and while your sister was harsh she certainly has a point: they have to much weight.

Someone else commented earlier that for this age, your daughter's should be the best physical shape of their life, and they arent wrong.The death of their mother aside, the stress that college brings, and getting older don't make health and fitness easier. Once you are heavily overweight or obese, your body carries those fat cells forever, even if you lose weight and they shrink.

Eating makes me writhe in pain  for hours. I live off pureed banana and protein drinks now. I have no energy because im starving all the time, yet eating hurts and makes me nauseated. Now, my liver enzymes are elevated because I have to boost protein and sugars and fats to compensate for no fiber in my diet. I'll probably develop type 3 diabetes as my pancreas declines (fatty pancreas). I'll probably get osteoporosis due to not being able to absorb minerals properly. I expect to eventually need my pancreas removed or have to be on long-term medication  for my liver damage. I may eventually need a gastric pacemaker or a nasal feeding tube.\n\nI can't enjoy meals with my family. The smell of cooking food makes me physically ill from hunger pain.
