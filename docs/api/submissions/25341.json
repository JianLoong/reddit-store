What the actual fuck is wrong with you? You\u2019re a disgusting human.\n\nYTA YTA YTA YTA YTA", "I'm sorry for your loss but YTA.  You were plainly told about the visit restrictions, and you put your own needs above your nephews.  Nothing you needed to say was more important than his.", "The fact that you don't even know why you're TA speaks for how much narcissistic you are. The world doesn't revolve around you, and if you still don't realize that after 49 years? Im sorry for everyone that's associated with you", "Wow you\u2019re probably the biggest AH I\u2019ve encountered on this sub.\n\nYTA YTA YTA", "You're a disgrace. YTA.", "YTA. You were told who the slots were for for that day and you decided you were more important than her own child. You should be ashamed of yourself!!!! If I was your nephew I doubt that I\u2019d ever forgive you.", "YTA she would have wanted to see her kids one last time rather than her sister. You\u2019re a selfish person and drew has every right not to forgive you", "YTA. Children, especially adult children, come ahead of siblings and parents in situations like this. Don't bother any of them anymore about this. You showed them. They know YTA.", "YTA.  I am so sorry for your loss.  They lost their mother though, and you were immensely selfish.  Even if you weren't thinking about your nephew, your sister probably wanted to see her child.  \n\nI love my brother so much, but if I had to choose, yes, I'd choose my child.  Every time.  Without hesitation.\n\nYou were selfish, heartless, and thoughtless.  I am genuinely so sorry for your poss.  But you owe your nephew a sincere, unreserved apology, and then the space to decide whether or not to accept it.", "Who is Tina? I'm so confused on that.", "Jeezus, wtf did I just read? You might be the biggest AH this sub has ever seen. Made me go hug my son. \n\nYou say you had no idea she'd pass that day? They were all trying to be with her, and you just pushed them out of the way with selfishness. You've taken something from him that can never be undone. I hope they cut you out of their lives. You are awful. YTA YTA YTA", "YTA, and as gently as possible...I think you know that already otherwise why are you asking internet strangers 2 years later? I'm sorry for your loss", "Who's Tina?", "Yeah I get that, but it\u2019s not like we knew she was going to die. That\u2019s not my fault", "But that\u2019s you, maybe in this case she had a better relationship with her sister than kids", "OH I read it and immediately knew another sub this is likely to be cross posted too (don't know if I can tag it as it is a little bit mean)", "Yep, reading this as someone who also lost their mum in 2021, I felt rage on behalf of her son. \n\nThe hospital were lovely enough to let both my sister and I see her with dad even though the restriction was 2. If either of my uncles were to do what this woman did they would need their own hospital bed after my sister would have been done with them.", "Instead of everyone getting mad and saying yta why aren't people asking why a friend and not the sister was there that sounds fucked I understand the son should have seen her but no friend is seeing my family member one last time instead of me don't care if that makes me an ah or not the family should not have had a friend there it should have been family", "Also if there were only 3 visits a day how were the three children and Tiffany all supposed to visit. Thats 4 visits not 3. So 2 children would have been robbed of visiting their mom. I would also like that explained because the story is not adding up to me.\n\nEdit: I actually reread a couple of more times and if I'm reading this correct NONE of the children got to see their mother that day???? OP said Frank counted towards a visit. So OP and Frank are two visits. And Tiffany was at the hospital so was Tiffany the 3rd?? So if im reading correctly then none of the children got to see her the day she passed???", "I came looking to see if anyone else saw this. I scrolled down thinking WTF is Tina?!", "and op", "I mean cant blame the admin for what was probably a government rule up until 2023 noone was allowed into the birthing room in ireland \n\nThe real ah is the mofo who ate bat soup", "No they were trying to follow the law and likely felt like As themselves but weren\u2019t. Additionally the nurses having to uphold it probably felt awful for it and felt OP was a massive A like the rest of us.\n\nWe got quite lucky when mum passed that the nurses said fuck it and let all 3 of us (dad, me, my sister) see her when it was meant to be 2", "You put yourself in a position to hear people's takes on the situation, you don't get to then decide that it's not your fault and that you are absolved of guilt. I think you were perhaps looking for people to assuage your guilt, but YTA op. You were told SPECIFICALLY who would be going there, regardless of whether or not you knew she was going to die, you went against a plan in place that ultimately ended up permanently hurting HER CHILDREN.", "It is your fault though. No one else took that slot, you did.", "That's not the point. You were selfish, ignored the wishes of her immediate family (her husband and children not you), and wound up being the cause of her children not getting to see her again before she passed.", "If you didn't know she was going to die, then why did you \"need\" to talk to her? Whatever nonsense you had to say could have waited if you thought you had more time. If you didn't, you're disgusting for robbing a dying woman of her final moment with her child. Trust me, as a mother myself, I can assure you that are in NO WAY shape or form as important as HER CHILD!!! If you were, she would have asked for you.  She didn't. YTA. \n\nGod I hope this is fake.", "you were told to NOT see her that day and you decided to make sure no one else could.", "\"When it was nearing the end.\" You knew.\n\nYou knew and still nearly every word in your post is about how YOU needed to tell her something and what YOU deserved.\n\nAnd what you did -- stopping a son from seeing his mom for the last time -- isn't even the worst thing. You stopped a mother from being able to say goodbye to her child.", "What a narcissistic, cold response. It's your fault that they were prevented from seeing their mother, and you knew this well beforehand because Frank told you. Whether or not she would have died that night is irrelevant to your blatant disrespect of their family.", "You were kindly told NO, and did it anyway.  It's your fault.", "Well then why couldn\u2019t you have waited till you got a slot? \n\nYou rushed in because you knew her time was coming, thats why her children were going that day. \n\nThere\u2019s no excusing this, I\u2019m heartbroken for your sister not getting to see all her children in her final hours - do you think she would forgive you for this?", "It would be insulting to actual idiots trying to lump you with them. You're worse than an idiot. AND YOU HAD THE AUDACITY TO YELL AT SOMEONE WHO WAS ACTUALLY SCHEDULED TO SEE HER. I hope you enjoy never seeing that family again. You royally fucked up. I would shame you daily if I were her children. How fuckin dare you.", "You know it wasnt your turn. You know she was diying. You dont know she would pass what did you not wait one day to see your sister because you already know \u2026 stop excusing your awful behavior", "Then why were you in a hurry to visit before the children?", "The lack of accountability is impressive", "You are a disturbed human being for doing that to her children. She loved them more than you, but you had to be an evil selfish AH! They will never forgive you for this. You are \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f", "Then why couldn't you wait for the next day? My biggest fear is losing one of my siblings, but I would never take priority over my niece and nephew.", "You kinda had an inkling though didn\u2019t you? Why didn\u2019t you say those things beforehand? Seriously you denied your nephew a chance to say goodbye to his own Mum for the very last time. There is no coming back from this one dude; no making it ok again; you blew it big time.", "Yta you robbed her children of seeing her once last time. As a result you will now lose atleast your nephew as well.", "making excuses so you dont have to take responsibility. nice.", "Omg no one is saying it\u2019s your fault she died! But it *is* your fault that you knowingly stole your nephew\u2019s chance to see his dying mother. What if he also had \u201cthings he needed to tell her\u201d?", "Yes it is because you knew you weren't supposed to be there and her son was", "You steamroller in and took up the visiting spot that her CHILD was going to use to see his mother. You knew you weren't welcome that day. It was horribly selfish of you, and that is ABSOLUTELY your fault. \n\nIf you were my aunt, I would honestly never forgive you. YTA, and probably the biggest one I've seen on here so far.", "So there was no reason you couldn\u2019t wait until the next day. Because you didn\u2019t know it was the last day right? \n\nAnd for the record, yes, her kids are more important (and take priority) over you.", "It\u2019s your fault take accountability for ruining a mother and her child\u2019s last chance at saying goodbye", "Her husband told you that you were not on the visitation list. She wanted to see her kids and you prevented that. This is definitely your fault. It doesn\u2019t matter if she passed that day or weeks later, you weren\u2019t supposed to be there. \nYTA", "Considering the tone of this post I doubt it.", "Type it. Sing it loud.", "Judging from OP's attitude it is entirely possible -- if not probable -- that the friend was a better family member to the sister than OP was.", "Moreover, why did the best friend ask why op was there? I\u2019m getting the vibe that op wasn\u2019t wanted there at the time and/or railroaded their way in. A lot of missing details", "\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5", "Hmm yes good point. The pointed \"I had things I had to say\" or words to that effect. Maybe she had some guilt to try and offload but she still the AH", "I agree lots of stuff missing but when I was scrolling comments i never seen one person ask why a friend and not any of the other family was there like why not there mom like I know she shouldn't have seen her over her child but as a sister should have seen her over the friend", "I think she was there as support not to visit, she may have been there for the kids as an honorary aunt. My mum and dad\u2019s best friend was there for us at the hospital when mum was there, not the day she passed but she\u2019d have been there if she could. Closer to her than I am my uncles."]}
