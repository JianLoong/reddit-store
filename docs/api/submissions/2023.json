He just turned 13 two weeks ago. Every time he gets one, which isn\u2019t very often now, we have the same routine. He soaks in the tub with the lights off while I throw a pair of underwear in the dryer. \nOnce he gets out, I give him a warm or cold cloth, depending on what he wants, and he\u2019ll get into my bed. He likes being close to me whenever these happen, and I\u2019ll massage his head until he falls asleep. The other night, he started to get a migraine. When he was in the bath, I told my girlfriend, who was staying the night, that he sleeps with me whenever these happen. I told her politely that if she didn\u2019t feel comfortable, then she would have to leave. His bed is too small to fit both of us, so that wasn\u2019t really an option. \nShe decided that she would go home but was upset about it. He was still feeling bad the next day, so I called her and let her know that he\u2019d probably still be sleeping with me tonight and that I would be in between them the entire time. \nShe said no and that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing a bed with a teenager. I said that was completely fine and I\u2019ll call her whenever he was feeling better. Around 5-6 that night, he was way better and out of bed. I called her to let her know, but she just seemed upset. Like, I could tell something was off. When I asked her, she got sniffily and told me it hurt her feelings that I kicked her out. Now, she\u2019s been in awful relationships before, and she\u2019s said I\u2019m the best one she\u2019s ever had, so I sort of get being upset easily, but at the same time, I gave her an option to stay or go.

You\u2019re doing a great job by establishing a routine with your son and prioritizing his wellbeing when under a migraine attack, they are absolutely *brutal*. I would recommend however finding an alternative to sleeping with you, as it is not sustainable long term. Perhaps a large body pillow and/or heating pad could help accomplish some of the same comfort.\n\nIf this is your GF\u2019s first experience with this, she might be a bit confused emotionally. Her history with bad relationships could result in feelings of rejection for this even though she didn\u2019t do anything wrong and it was more of a logistical conundrum. It\u2019s great that you provided the offer of staying or going with context. \n\nA good conversation once son is fully recovered seems to be the answer here.", "NAH\n\nI can see why she might be a bit offended, but hopefully she'll understand that it wasn't personal and it's just what you do for your son. She should see that you're a good parent.\n\nBut, info: I'm really confused by the relevance of putting the underwear in the dryer! \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Your girlfriend should understand. Plus, if you gave her the option to stay in another room, she should have nothing to complain about.", "NTA, you were prioritizing your kid as you should be. She had the choice to stay or leave and she chose to leave, then acted like you made her leave. You didn\u2019t do wrong here.", "NAH here. Obviously your commitment is to looking after your son, and migraines are really miserable. Your GF is obviously not used to that routine, perhaps doesn\u2019t understand how bad migraines are, and was probably caught completely off guard by being asked to vacate the bed - especially if she doesn\u2019t have children of her own. She might even have felt like perhaps your son did it to get rid of her? You don\u2019t say how long you\u2019ve been together or how well they get on generally.\n\nWorth just chatting through and explaining things to her, so that she can understand. Set out clearly what happens when your son has a migraine -  could you perhaps get your son a bigger bed so that you could go and sleep there when he has a migraine? Then your gf won\u2019t find herself suddenly displaced", "NTA. You need to be very clear with her though that your child will always come first. If she can\u2019t accept that then she isn\u2019t the right woman for you and your son.", "NTA\n\nYou told her what was happening, how you do things, and you gave her the option to go home, you didn't kick her out.  You gave her all the information you had and she made an informed choice not to stay because she would not be comfortable.", "ok one question first - why did you put a pair of underwear in the dryer????   \n\nalso you might want to try acupressure for his headaches.  it works pretty well for all of my husbands aches and pains\n\nNTA but it would\u2019ve been totally weird and creepy for the 3 of you to be in one bed.  your GF needs to be a little more understanding that your son\u2019s pain comes before date night\n\ni understand her disappointment but she has to be a little more mature when these situations arise.  her past bad relationships have nothing to do with this one", "NTA. \n\nYou gave her a choice. She chose it. She needs to know how it is with you and your son.\n\nChildren come first. Hope your son feels better.", "NTA\n\nYou're putting your child's needs first and you're communicating with your loved one with what's going on.", "NTA, migraines are pure utter misery (i used to get them), you need to seriously reevaluate you relationship with this woman though", "When you have a child, your main obligation is to the child. If a so does not understand this, perhaps you should drop the so.", "NAH. this might be a compatibility issue.", "- Your girlfriend entered a relationship with you fully knowing you have a child\n- Your girlfriend should know by now that you\u2019re an active parent and that\u2019s not going to change \n- Your girlfriend should understand that your child will always come first for you, if she doesn\u2019t then she has no business being in your lives \n- Your girlfriend doesn\u2019t live with you so she shouldn\u2019t be angry over you rightfully prioritizing your child \n\n\nInfo: Have you ever had a sit-down conversation about where your relationship is heading and how she fits into the equation? Or how she wants to fit in the equation? Because you and your kiddo are a package deal and it needs to remain that way.", "NTA but you need to think about whether this woman is right for you.  Also, I'm so sorry your baby has migraines.  That fucking awful as an adult, I can't imagine coping with that level of pain as a child.", "NTA it sucks for the GF but you are a parent. Obviously your main priority will be your son when he has a migraine. I only ever had 1 or 2 and they were unbearable.\n\nThe only compromise I have is if you have a spare room to act as a place for her to sleep when these migraines happen. That way she doesn't have to return home if she wants to be over.", "NTA\n\nYou were taking care of your child, there's no reason for her to be upset about that. She was wrong to make an issue out of this.\n\nThere are many ways this could have played out well, she could have stayed there and kept you company while you cared for him, she could have visited for a little while, or just happily given you space to tend to your son.", "NTA \n\nAs someone who used to suffer from migraines before my daith piercing I can say you did the right thing, your son needs to come first", "NTA. Put the towel in the dryer too. You were taking care of your son. She should understand that. How long have you been together? If she doesn\u2019t know about the migraines maybe not that long? Maybe have a conversation about your son and her expectations to make sure both of you are on the same page.", "INFO - if this relationship progresses and she moves in, do you have a plan that doesn't involve forcing her to share a bed with a teenager?", "NTA\n\nYou are putting your son first as a father should and any right minded person should see that. She obviously wants to be your priority and not your son, major red flag there dad. Is this really the type of person you want around your son?", "Son > Girlfriend. Period. \nNTA", "BTA, but you know that there is anti-migraine medication that\u2019s like an epi pen: quick jab in the leg right as the patient feels the migraine coming on, and it\u2019s gone in 20-30mins", "Info: how old is this kid?", "NTA a hundred times over.\n\nI'm a HUGE baby when I'm sick (so much so, it's embarrassing). However, nothing feels more safe and secure than having your person next to you. And you are your son's person. And I'm sorry he's going through chronic migraines, he's a strong soul.\n\nYour girlfriend should understand and if she can't, maybe she's not the right one for Y'ALL.", "YTA.  There are various first aid and preventative procedures to deal with migraine.  Soaking in the tub with the lights off?  Sounds soothing.  Crawl into bed with parent and have your head massaged until you fall asleep.  Also sounds soothing.  What confuses me is, why does your son suffer so long?  A teenage son, at that.  If it happens more than twice a month, then he really should be on low-dose doxepin to prevent migraines.  Migraines that often would be debilitating.  But a very low dose of anti-depressant will totally cure him.  As in, no more migraines.  If it's like once a month or less, then no need for prescription anti-depressant.  In that case, you just stock up on aspirin and tylenol.  When your son first feels a migraine might be starting...\n\n\\-  2 aspirin PLUS\n\n\\-  2 tylenol PLUS\n\n\\-  Wash it down with Mountain Dew, Coke, or strong cup of coffee (for the caffeine)\n\nIn 30 minutes, migraine is gone.  I'm guessing the bath routine would take longer than that.\n\nYou are letting your teenage son interfere with your love life for no logical reason.  If this routine is important to YOU, then you should re-think the whole girlfriend situation.  Like, stop dating until the kiddo is launched.  \n\nBut me?  I'm a father of two teenagers.  If one of them suffered from migraines, I would offer them proper medical treatment first.  If they wanted to do anything else like soak in a tub in a dark room, that is on them.  Just as long as they give me my space.  Crawling into bed with me and my girlfriend?  Nope.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have debilitating migraines that can last anywhere from 6-24 hours (thankfully they used to last up to 48, but no longer). I know my triggers, but a few days before or during or after my period, there's nothing I can do to prevent them. I've tried migraine meds, don't work unless I take them early very early on which doesn't help if I wake up with one. I'm on anti-depressants and still get migraines. So the best I can do is pay attention to my triggers as best as I can and try to minimize the duration. I'm sharing these details because your experience is absolutely not universal. I do wish there was a one solution fits all, but absolutely not true for migraines.  OP is NTA.", "Uhmm, you know everyone's migraine experience is different right? I have tried so many endless medicines (including but not limited to anti-depressants, anti-seizure, triptans, CGRP antagonists and every OTC med imaginable)  vitamins, and holistic treatment options and combinations of these, seen multiple doctors and specialists, had MRIs and blood tests to ensure nothing else was going on. And I still get migraines that can knock me out for days. And I mean curled up in bed trying not to puke out my guts or scream knocked out. Last winter i had one that had me curled up in bed unable to function for a week straight. If his son gets even the slightest bit of comfort from a head massage (very rarely effective for me due to extreme skin sensitivity with my migraines but very effective for a friend of mine and my father and mother-in-law) then I say way to go dad! This man likely feels helpless every time his some is laid out like this and has found a way to take an active role in helping his son recover. One of the few times I have ever seen my dad cry was when I was explaining what my migraines were like and everything that had been tried to relieve them and he realized there was absolutely nothing he could do to help. You're experience with migraines being easily stopped in their tracks is NOT everyone's experience and you are as lucky as a migraine sufferer can possibly be to be able to reliable stop them in the manner you can.", "Oh look at you. Aren\u2019t you delightful in how you assume that certain medications cure migraines.\n\nI\u2019ve lived my entire life with chronic daily migraine disorder.
