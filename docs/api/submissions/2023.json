He just turned 13 two weeks ago. Every time he gets one, which isn\u2019t very often now, we have the same routine. He soaks in the tub with the lights off while I throw a pair of underwear in the dryer. \nOnce he gets out, I give him a warm or cold cloth, depending on what he wants, and he\u2019ll get into my bed. He likes being close to me whenever these happen, and I\u2019ll massage his head until he falls asleep. The other night, he started to get a migraine. When he was in the bath, I told my girlfriend, who was staying the night, that he sleeps with me whenever these happen. I told her politely that if she didn\u2019t feel comfortable, then she would have to leave. His bed is too small to fit both of us, so that wasn\u2019t really an option. \nShe decided that she would go home but was upset about it. He was still feeling bad the next day, so I called her and let her know that he\u2019d probably still be sleeping with me tonight and that I would be in between them the entire time. \nShe said no and that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing a bed with a teenager. I said that was completely fine and I\u2019ll call her whenever he was feeling better. Around 5-6 that night, he was way better and out of bed. I called her to let her know, but she just seemed upset. Like, I could tell something was off. When I asked her, she got sniffily and told me it hurt her feelings that I kicked her out. Now, she\u2019s been in awful relationships before, and she\u2019s said I\u2019m the best one she\u2019s ever had, so I sort of get being upset easily, but at the same time, I gave her an option to stay or go.

You\u2019re doing a great job by establishing a routine with your son and prioritizing his wellbeing when under a migraine attack, they are absolutely *brutal*. I would recommend however finding an alternative to sleeping with you, as it is not sustainable long term. Perhaps a large body pillow and/or heating pad could help accomplish some of the same comfort.\n\nIf this is your GF\u2019s first experience with this, she might be a bit confused emotionally. Her history with bad relationships could result in feelings of rejection for this even though she didn\u2019t do anything wrong and it was more of a logistical conundrum.

There are various first aid and preventative procedures to deal with migraine.  Soaking in the tub with the lights off?  Sounds soothing.  Crawl into bed with parent and have your head massaged until you fall asleep.  Also sounds soothing.  What confuses me is, why does your son suffer so long?  A teenage son, at that.  If it happens more than twice a month, then he really should be on low-dose doxepin to prevent migraines.  Migraines that often would be debilitating.  But a very low dose of anti-depressant will totally cure him.  As in, no more migraines.  If it's like once a month or less, then no need for prescription anti-depressant.  In that case, you just stock up on aspirin and tylenol.  When your son first feels a migraine might be starting...\n\n\\-  2 aspirin PLUS\n\n\\-  2 tylenol PLUS\n\n\\-  Wash it down with Mountain Dew, Coke, or strong cup of coffee (for the caffeine)\n\nIn 30 minutes, migraine is gone.  I'm guessing the bath routine would take longer than that.\n\nYou are letting your teenage son interfere with your love life for no logical reason.  If this routine is important to YOU, then you should re-think the whole girlfriend situation.  Like, stop dating until the kiddo is launched.  \n\nBut me?  I'm a father of two teenagers.  If one of them suffered from migraines, I would offer them proper medical treatment first.  If they wanted to do anything else like soak in a tub in a dark room, that is on them.  Just as long as they give me my space.  Crawling into bed with me and my girlfriend?  Nope.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know my triggers, but a few days before or during or after my period, there's nothing I can do to prevent them. I've tried migraine meds, don't work unless I take them early very early on which doesn't help if I wake up with one. I'm on anti-depressants and still get migraines. So the best I can do is pay attention to my triggers as best as I can and try to minimize the duration. I'm sharing these details because your experience is absolutely not universal. I do wish there was a one solution fits all, but absolutely not true for migraines.  OP is NTA.", "Uhmm, you know everyone's migraine experience is different right? I have tried so many endless medicines (including but not limited to anti-depressants, anti-seizure, triptans, CGRP antagonists and every OTC med imaginable)  vitamins, and holistic treatment options and combinations of these, seen multiple doctors and specialists, had MRIs and blood tests to ensure nothing else was going on. And I still get migraines that can knock me out for days. And I mean curled up in bed trying not to puke out my guts or scream knocked out. Last winter i had one that had me curled up in bed unable to function for a week straight. If his son gets even the slightest bit of comfort from a head massage (very rarely effective for me due to extreme skin sensitivity with my migraines but very effective for a friend of mine and my father and mother-in-law) then I say way to go dad! This man likely feels helpless every time his some is laid out like this and has found a way to take an active role in helping his son recover. One of the few times I have ever seen my dad cry was when I was explaining what my migraines were like and everything that had been tried to relieve them and he realized there was absolutely nothing he could do to help.

My 12 year old is down for 3 days at a time with hers. It would be a dream if something that simple could help her!", "Such an odd comment\u2026 Typically when someone asks you to put something in the dryer till they\u2019re done bathing - it usually means that person would like to wear it to warm up once they\u2019re done bathing. \n\nI do the same with blankets or pants.", "it seems he gets in the bath to help so i\u2019m guessing that the water is cold so they warm him up", "Ugh!

Don't know which one is true for your gf, but I'd think it's one of those.\n\nAs someone with horrible migraines as a teen myself but also a cold relationship to my parents my initial thought reading your post was \"Why tf needs a 13 year old to sleep in bed with daddy because of a migraine?\" Of course rationally I know that's bullshit and I am wrong since it's just a form of caring for each other. Since I am an adult I have learned that lots of kids find comfort in \"cuddling\" with their parents even as teens. Rationally I am aware of that and see it's a good thing. But on an emotional level for people who never experienced such a thing as kids themselves this kind of closeness is hard to understand. \n\nSo I guess your girlfriend is not hurt because you cared for your kid when he was in pain but she can't understand why it's so important you share a bed even when she was already there and planning to stay. Why he can't just sleep in his room and call if he needs anything. Because lots of people can't imagine how much physical closeness to a parent can help a kid in pain because they never experienced it themselves.\n\nTherefore it's important you sit down together and have a talk about that. How important it is for your son or your parent-kid-relationship to maintain this ritual but maybe also a plan how to handle that in the future if your kid gets migraine. What if your gf is there for the night and son gets migraine at 2am? Will you kick out gf in the middle of the night? \n\nIf you're serious about the relationship you need to see how you can make it work.", "INFO: was there another bedroom that wasn\u2019t your son\u2019s ready to go for her to sleep in?", "NTA. As someone with migraines you sound like an amazing parent. I have a fluffy hoodie I like when I get migraines, it\u2019s all about finding what works for you and helps deal with then.

Massive kudos to you", "Nta", "You are a caring father", "NAH \n\nThis sounds like a new relationship and it's easy to see this as \"kid is sick, takes over bed\" instead of \"kid has debilitating medical condition, but parent and kid have determined the most effective treatment\" .   \n\n\nSit down with the girlfriend and explain some background and be clear you weren't kicking her out on a whim. This is a serious medical treatment. You obviously have a close and comfortable routine to support your son when he is infrequently unwell. You spent time developing this and it works for both of you and prioritizes his health. You are a good parent.   \n\n\nHopefully she sees that you are caring and loving and supportive to those who need it and recognises that as a great thing about you.   \n\n\nBut I don't think that's she's a jerk for not recognising all that immediately.
