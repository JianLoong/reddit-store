He soaks in the tub with the lights off while I throw a pair of underwear in the dryer. \nOnce he gets out, I give him a warm or cold cloth, depending on what he wants, and he\u2019ll get into my bed.

When he was in the bath, I told my girlfriend, who was staying the night, that he sleeps with me whenever these happen. I told her politely that if she didn\u2019t feel comfortable, then she would have to leave. His bed is too small to fit both of us, so that wasn\u2019t really an option. \nShe decided that she would go home but was upset about it. He was still feeling bad the next day, so I called her and let her know that he\u2019d probably still be sleeping with me tonight and that I would be in between them the entire time. \nShe said no and that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing a bed with a teenager. I said that was completely fine and I\u2019ll call her whenever he was feeling better. Around 5-6 that night, he was way better and out of bed. I called her to let her know, but she just seemed upset. Like, I could tell something was off. When I asked her, she got sniffily and told me it hurt her feelings that I kicked her out.

Perhaps a large body pillow and/or heating pad could help accomplish some of the same comfort.\n\nIf this is your GF\u2019s first experience with this, she might be a bit confused emotionally. Her history with bad relationships could result in feelings of rejection for this even though she didn\u2019t do anything wrong and it was more of a logistical conundrum.

There are various first aid and preventative procedures to deal with migraine.  Soaking in the tub with the lights off?  Sounds soothing.  Crawl into bed with parent and have your head massaged until you fall asleep.  Also sounds soothing.  What confuses me is, why does your son suffer so long?  A teenage son, at that.  If it happens more than twice a month, then he really should be on low-dose doxepin to prevent migraines.  Migraines that often would be debilitating.  But a very low dose of anti-depressant will totally cure him.  As in, no more migraines.  If it's like once a month or less, then no need for prescription anti-depressant.  In that case, you just stock up on aspirin and tylenol.  When your son first feels a migraine might be starting...\n\n\\-  2 aspirin PLUS\n\n\\-  2 tylenol PLUS\n\n\\-  Wash it down with Mountain Dew, Coke, or strong cup of coffee (for the caffeine)\n\nIn 30 minutes, migraine is gone.  I'm guessing the bath routine would take longer than that.\n\nYou are letting your teenage son interfere with your love life for no logical reason.  If this routine is important to YOU, then you should re-think the whole girlfriend situation.  Like, stop dating until the kiddo is launched.  \n\nBut me?  I'm a father of two teenagers.  If one of them suffered from migraines, I would offer them proper medical treatment first.  If they wanted to do anything else like soak in a tub in a dark room, that is on them.  Just as long as they give me my space.  Crawling into bed with me and my girlfriend?  Nope.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know my triggers, but a few days before or during or after my period, there's nothing I can do to prevent them. I've tried migraine meds, don't work unless I take them early very early on which doesn't help if I wake up with one. I'm on anti-depressants and still get migraines. So the best I can do is pay attention to my triggers as best as I can and try to minimize the duration. I'm sharing these details because your experience is absolutely not universal. I do wish there was a one solution fits all, but absolutely not true for migraines.  OP is NTA.", "Uhmm, you know everyone's migraine experience is different right? I have tried so many endless medicines (including but not limited to anti-depressants, anti-seizure, triptans, CGRP antagonists and every OTC med imaginable)  vitamins, and holistic treatment options and combinations of these, seen multiple doctors and specialists, had MRIs and blood tests to ensure nothing else was going on. And I still get migraines that can knock me out for days. And I mean curled up in bed trying not to puke out my guts or scream knocked out. Last winter i had one that had me curled up in bed unable to function for a week straight. If his son gets even the slightest bit of comfort from a head massage (very rarely effective for me due to extreme skin sensitivity with my migraines but very effective for a friend of mine and my father and mother-in-law) then I say way to go dad! This man likely feels helpless every time his some is laid out like this and has found a way to take an active role in helping his son recover. One of the few times I have ever seen my dad cry was when I was explaining what my migraines were like and everything that had been tried to relieve them and he realized there was absolutely nothing he could do to help.

Don't know which one is true for your gf, but I'd think it's one of those.\n\nAs someone with horrible migraines as a teen myself but also a cold relationship to my parents my initial thought reading your post was \"Why tf needs a 13 year old to sleep in bed with daddy because of a migraine?\" Of course rationally I know that's bullshit and I am wrong since it's just a form of caring for each other. Since I am an adult I have learned that lots of kids find comfort in \"cuddling\" with their parents even as teens. Rationally I am aware of that and see it's a good thing. But on an emotional level for people who never experienced such a thing as kids themselves this kind of closeness is hard to understand. \n\nSo I guess your girlfriend is not hurt because you cared for your kid when he was in pain but she can't understand why it's so important you share a bed even when she was already there and planning to stay. Why he can't just sleep in his room and call if he needs anything. Because lots of people can't imagine how much physical closeness to a parent can help a kid in pain because they never experienced it themselves.\n\nTherefore it's important you sit down together and have a talk about that. How important it is for your son or your parent-kid-relationship to maintain this ritual but maybe also a plan how to handle that in the future if your kid gets migraine. What if your gf is there for the night and son gets migraine at 2am? Will you kick out gf in the middle of the night? \n\nIf you're serious about the relationship you need to see how you can make it work.", "INFO: was there another bedroom that wasn\u2019t your son\u2019s ready to go for her to sleep in?", "NTA. As someone with migraines you sound like an amazing parent. I have a fluffy hoodie I like when I get migraines, it\u2019s all about finding what works for you and helps deal with then.

This is a serious medical treatment. You obviously have a close and comfortable routine to support your son when he is infrequently unwell. You spent time developing this and it works for both of you and prioritizes his health. You are a good parent.   \n\n\nHopefully she sees that you are caring and loving and supportive to those who need it and recognises that as a great thing about you.   \n\n\nBut I don't think that's she's a jerk for not recognising all that immediately.

It\u2019s practical in general, but it would also be nice to be able to stay in his room with him during migraines without your girlfriend needing to leave. Also, might want to talk to a specialist to see how you can adjust your routine to have him recover from his migraines with more independence.

Your gf is an adult and actually should have been more understanding and sympathic instead of making this about her.", "It all comes down to ppl not understanding, maybe she thinks hes being a spoilt child demanding your time cause she doesnt understand a migraine.\n\nPpl throw this term around so some dnt understand its not a headache, weve all had a headache but until i got a migraine by fuck did i feel for ppl that suffer constantly.\n\nI think maybe she doesnt understand the severity and the pain because its not just a headache.\n\nHonestly my head was throbbing, the pain never lets up its so intense, light and noise wants you put a bullet through ya head.", "OP, I've got to praise you on being such a great parent. I'd suggest talking with her and explaining, educating, and helping her through understanding how bad migraines can be. My hopes is that she will come to understand and your relationship will blossom even futher.\n\n(P.S. I can relate with your gf on coming from awful relationship, so keep being amazing to her.)", "NTA. Kids' needs always come first.", "NTA. I can understand her being a bit put out. But really? Being sniffy with you? Sounds selfish. She\u2019s been in awful relationships before. And one of the reasons you\u2019re a good one is you\u2019re a father who puts his child first. She needs to grow up a little.", "I actually can\u2019t understand why she is offended that a father prioritizes taking care of his child. She seems immature and self centered. He\u2019s definitely NTA in my book.", "I love that because your son asked you for something that comforts him, you just do it. What a wonderful parent you are, absolutely great job. \n\nAs someone who suffered terrible migraines for a very long time. I wish I had parents like this, mine just yelled at me for being \"lazy\" or \"needy\".", "NAH he\u2019s your child and he needs his parent.  Hopefully he\u2019s growing out of their frequency.\n\nBut yeah as a woman sharing a bed with a teen dude is weird if you don\u2019t have a motherly relationship", "wow artificial sweeteners.  i guess that shouldn\u2019t be such a surprise.  at least you can avoid those.  the hormones have got to be a bigger battle", "Yes, they help somewhat. What I do now is use Icy Hot maximum strength roll on and apply it on my forehead and on top of my eyes. THIS BURNS and I DO NOT RECOMMEND it for those with sensitive skin.  But the burning sensation takes over and so I don't feel the migraine pain and accompanying symptoms for about 20 min, which is such a relief lol.", "They're much harder to avoid post the sugar tax here in the UK. It's actually a remarkably common reaction  to aspartame and asculfamene k especially. The hormones are a pain, and I spend, on average, a day a month in bed. On the plus side, my hormone migraines aren't quite as bad as the sweetener migraines. Silver linings and all that", "What makes me laugh is, when people say iv a migraine but I went to work, If you have a migraine your not going any where. lol", "Since I've gotten out of high school I have learned to spot the triggers and avoid them. Most of the time I can head them off at the pass but sometimes they still creep up and knock me out flat.", "it just goes to show you that the body is ready to handle issues that arise from its own inner workings.  it\u2019s all the unnatural crap that the government allows companies to feed us, clothe us and let us breathe in, that do the most damage. and i\u2019m pretty sure your government is vigilant and more forthcoming  about that stuff than ours here in the US\n\ni am sorry you have to deal with that kind of pain tho", "OI. Yes, I've been there. At lunch hour at work, I'd close my door, turn off my lights and then sit under my desk and try and zone out. Thankfully I have enough leave now that I don't have to do things like that.", "OMG! I'm so sorry.  Cleaning up your own mess in the midst of a migraine...sounds like the worst to me :(", "Honestly I've been to work with migraines. But I shouldn't have been there. Thankfully I had an office and could shut my door and put down the shades and zone out with an eye mask. And I'd have to go to the bathroom periodically to throw up. Thats what happens when you don't have leave. Thankfully those days are long behind me ..", "I've definitely been making the move towards more natural ingredients in my food and drink the last few years.\n\nI'm careful, although I find it somewhat ironic that the government introduced a tax that means that I can pretty much only have tea, coffee or alcohol when I go out for a meal (or water, but I drink that as well as tea and coffee all day at home, why would I want to do it out ans about?) so I drink more alcohol which is arguably worse for you.", "Oh it was haha", "Probably the stress. Have had the same following travel days. \nStress is one of my triggers. Also weather changes (fun this summer \ud83d\ude11) and too little sleep.", "I would\u2019ve felt the exact same way", "NAH your child will always come first, and she\u2019s being selfish", "Migraine sufferer and mom to a migraine sufferer here.  Nta and gold star shower for you for good parenting.  Every migraine sufferer needs a fairy godmother like you during a migraine. Thank you for kicking ass at supporting your son.", "NAH. You're being a good parent and taking care of your kid, and it's not like you didn't offer for her to stay. She's entitled to be upset that she was interrupted, but it's not like it wasn't for a good reason. It's frustrating and inconvenient all around, but nobody is doing anything wrong", "NTA As a migrane sufferer I have my siblings scratch my scalp. This is 99% effective in getting rid of my migranes", "NTA. I do understand that your girlfriend, may have been hurt, specifically if she had complicated past relationships, but it's important that you take care of your child when he is sick.\n\nI hope your son feels better soon. I also had migraines as a child, it was ROUGH.", "To be fair you didn't kick her out. You gave her that option and she walked.\n\nI understand she feels offended but she has to understand this is something you have done for a long time with your son and it works. Ofc you would wanna continue with it.\nShe will have to come to terms with it, because I don't think he will continue doing this the older he gets\ud83e\udd23", "NTA but could it be that your gf felt slightly dismissed? Wouldn\u2019t it have been better to have her sleep in your son\u2019s bed and \u2018help you help him\u2019 the next day? She probably wants to be a good partner, not only when life is smooth sailing. Maybe you can ask her that question as an opener to making up?", "I imagine at the son grows older, he won\u2019t want to sleep in his dad\u2019s bed.", "Exactly. It's not an insurmountable issue, but there needs to be a plan", "There are also silent migraines where you get the nausea and other symptoms except the headache.", "My triggers are primarily weather, scents, and other environmental triggers.", "People who\u2019ve never been experienced a migraine have NO CLUE how agonizing they are.  And once they\u2019re gone, you get the migraine hangover. They\u2019re just the worst.", "You are probably right! Doesn't help that my work has been hectic this year!!! And I sleep like crap. \n\nMaybe I just need to be on vacation permanently..."]}
