{"id": 13295, "submission_id": "123fex3", "title": "AITA for leaving my (51M) daughter (13F) at the mall?", "selftext": "For context, my daughter, Ella, and I have always had a strained relationship. Her mother divorced me when she was a baby, and did everything in her power to keep Ella away from me, even moving to a different state when Ella was 2. I only got a visitation of 8 days a month until she was old enough to start elementary school, and after that, only school breaks/long weekends. From the time the visitation started, Ella made it clear that she hated visiting me. She would never listen to me, arguing with me about my rules or outright breaking them. When she was really little and I would pick her up for a visit from the airport, she would cry and scream to stay with her mother and grandmother (I tried my best to cut her contact with her mother\u2019s side during my visitations to foster our relationship without interference, but I wasn\u2019t always able to, and it led to her being much too dependent on them, while also allowing them to influence her against me). As she\u2019s gotten older, it\u2019s been even more difficult to get her to come visit me where I live, so I\u2019ve been going to visit her, instead (thankfully, her mother pays for all my travel expenses).  \n\nThat brings us to now. I flew up to visit Ella. We went to the mall an hour or so before closing time. It was one of our better visits, she was pleasant and talkative, but while we were walking through the food court, she happened to see some friends of hers. Apparently, the friends had graduated from middle school the year before, so she hadn\u2019t seen them in a while. All Ella wanted to do was hangout with them. She barely even noticed me anymore, wanting to go to some store with the group, so I told her I was leaving. She asked me to stay but I refused. Why should I stay when I wasn\u2019t her priority? I\u2019d traveled all the way to see her and the moment her friends showed up, she didn\u2019t care about me anymore. I didn\u2019t want to spend my time chaperoning while she socialized with them instead of me. So I left and went back to my hotel.\n\nHer mother called me the next day and yelled at me for leaving her at the mall. Apparently, the friends had been about to leave, and since the mall was closing, Ella had to wait outside in the dark until her mother and grandmother could come pick her up, which scared her. But her friends agreed to stay with her while she waited, so it\u2019s not like she was alone. And the mall was only about 10 minutes from her house, so she didn\u2019t have to wait for long. She just really hurt me by choosing her friends over spending time with me, just like she chooses everyone else over me, and I didn\u2019t see the point in making an effort if she wasn\u2019t going to, either.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679902654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123fex3/aita_for_leaving_my_51m_daughter_13f_at_the_mall/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s clear that you really only care about yourself and your feelings and not your daughter\u2019s. You got overly emotional that your daughter wanted to talk to her friends? Spending time with her isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about her. You had a chance to cultivate your relationship but instead you got caught up in your feelings and acted like a petulant child. It\u2019s no wonder why your daughter doesn\u2019t like spending time with you.", "YTA   \n\n\nYou are the adult here. You shoud've communicated and said \"Hey, I get it that you want to hang out with friends but I was really looknig forward to our alone time\" or you could've offered a fun activity. She is a child of course she would rather hang out with friends, weren't you the same at 13? Regardless, have you thought about a reason why you are not that close? It's the choice of words that's bothering me. It seems like you are blaming everyone for the lack of relationships with her but yourself.", "INFO: Your ex did everything in her power to keep Ella away from you, except she pays for your travel costs to visit?

I understand that you\u2019ve had a really rocky relationship with your daughter, but that\u2019s a 13 year old who hadn\u2019t seen her friends in a while and you\u2019re a grown adult. You should be lucky that your daughter wanted you to be there while she hung out with her friends. A lot of teenagers would want their parents gone for that. She trusted you, and you broke that trust. Whether she chooses someone else over you is irrelevant. Your job is to keep her safe and be there when she needs you. Grow up, act your age, and apologize to your daughter.", "YTA, why would you leave your child alone at the mall? Especially when you knew it was closing very soon and she would have no way of going home. \n\nThis also doesn't help on improving your relationship with your daughter since this doesn't seem like a great experience for her.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2018re an adult, and you should be capable of communicating properly. You can\u2018t just leave your child at the mall, this is abandonement and you just proved that you aren\u2019t a good parent.", "YTA You were petty and abandoned her because you felt abandoned. Congratulations on giving your ex all the ammo she'll ever need, without ever needing to say a word against you. What you should have said was \"I'll be waiting at x location\" or \"text me when your done talking with your friends\"", "If that trip was one of the more \u201cpleasant ones\u201d as you say, then you should have been more open on maybe getting to know her friends more.

YTA.", "Fuck you as if you leave your 13 year old daughter at the mall. As I parent I can\u2019t begin to explain just how immature you were having a hissy over her running into friends. You\u2019re a pathetic excuse for a father", "YTA. i understand why she doesn\u2019t like spending time with you. what were you fucking thinking when leaving her alone when mall was about to close? especially when she asked you to stay.\n\nshe is a 13 year old, not you. quit whining about \u201cnot feeling like a priority\u201d and leaving a 13 year old alone like that.", "YTA\n\nYou left your kid at the mall when she wasn't paying enough attention to you. Read that again.  No wonder she'd rather be with other people.", "Yta; you\u2019re the adult and she\u2019s your child- it\u2019s up to you to make the effort because you\u2019re her dad. Why can\u2019t you or don\u2019t you pay for your own travel to see your child? It\u2019s not kind of you to have left her there when she asked you to stay either", "YTA. You are an adult and a father. Sometimes you have to put with things like that. You dont just leave a child at the store because you didn't pay attention to you", "YTA for getting your back up and throwing a wobble because your CHILD saw her friends at a mall and wanted to see them too. Friends are just as important as family, it's not like she makes a habit of it and at most, would have taken an hour. You are an adult yet you acted like a stroppy teen who was left out. Kidnappings happen in seconds so what you did was extremely stupid.", "YTA\n\n\nYou knew the mall was closing shortly. \"I didn't want to spend my time chaperoning\"(even only for a very short time)... you seemingly don't see yourself as her parent.\n\n\n\n- you not being the center of her attention for every second of that day is not a crime done by her. \n\n\n- you seem to have no interest in what kind of people your kids hang out with. Something that highly influences her behaviour and future. \n\n\n- you seem to not feel responsible for her safty- as a parent you are\n\n\n\nTo me this is 100% on you and that you don't feel as an actual father", "How can you write these lines and think you are not TA..\n\nYTA - of course.\n\nYou are a grown man and your daughter is a young teenager. Of course her friends are much more fun than her dad, she barely sees. From what you write it must feel like a chore to her. Of course this whole situation is awful for you. At first it is quite a pleasent trip and then she rejects you. You are not TA for feeling bad and not necessarily for her not feeling comfortable around you. This can be your own faults from the past but also interferences from her mom and grandmom. We don't know.\n\nBut you are a massive AH for leaving her alone in the mall. She will remember this and not in a good way. I was once forgotten to pick up from sports by my parents, or rather picked up quite late. I wasnt scared, but i still remember that, although it is probably 25 years or more ago, and that was by mistake. Your did this on purpose.", "YTA \n\nI understand that she hurt your feelings, but *you* are adult. *You* are supposed to put your feelings aside and realize she\u2019s a young teenager. As an adult *you* should remember that social groups and interactions are very important at that age.\n\nInstead of waiting patiently for it to run its course you pouted like a child.\n\n*She* is the child, not you. You can indulge your hurt feelings later when you\u2019re alone.", "YTA. You sound exactly like my ex and my daughter is exactly like yours down to the screaming not to leave with her father when she was younger. Don\u2019t expect a future relationship. If I was mom, I\u2019d be in court so fast your head would spin. You put your daughter in danger because she was being a normal teen. When my daughter sees her friends, she forgets I am there too. You know what I do? I grab a seat nearby and wait. Or I say I\u2019m getting something from the food court and I will be right back. I would never consider leaving her, even if I was mad or she hurt my feelings.", "Wow, YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re using the fact that things just so happened to turn out okay to defend your actions, which are: you *abandoned* a *child* you were *responsible for*. If those friends had left earlier and she was left alone after dark at a closed mall, you might have major consequences to worry about for her and for you. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s this sort of thing that makes her hate your visits. You want approval and appreciation from her. You need to make a way better case for yourself than you\u2019re making. You need to not, for example? storm off in a huff in response to her wanting to catch up with people she hadn\u2019t seen in longer than it\u2019s been since she\u2019s last seen you. \n\nSeriously, dude, grow up and earn the goddamn respect you think you\u2019re entitled to.", "YTA. Upto the moment you left her  I was on your side. You have now lost your daughter. She will not want to see you next visitation, and all the evil badmouthing your ex has probably done, your daughter will believe. Your ex is probably really happy to have won the war.", "YTA. \n\nSo first, your daughter is a child and so much of this behavior is normal for a child. \n\nA week away from her mother and everything she knows is difficult and purposefully cutting off contact during a scary, tumultuous time for a kid, is crappy. It could\u2019ve provided your daughter a modicum of comfort, which might\u2019ve made the whole situation a lot easier on everyone. Also, it\u2019s ok for a child to be dependent on their parent. It\u2019s kind of the whole parent child relationship deal. \n\nNow, to the present day issue. Your daughter ran into friends she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time and ignored you. This is pretty understandable behavior for most people, especially for a thirteen year old. You don\u2019t mention it here, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if you returned to your hotel without even notifying your daughter. She\u2019s 13 years old. You already have a shaky relationship and your behavior just proves that your love is conditional on her paying attention to you. At such a young age, there should be no conditions on the care and affection you give her. You shouldn\u2019t be holding your issues with your ex against your daughter. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t even begin to address the issue of leaving a child at the mall by herself. A ton of things could happen in \u201conly ten minutes.\u201d Her physical safety could\u2019ve been in jeopardy, not to mention her emotional safety was definitely traumatized here. \n\nYou are the parent. She is the child. She is allowed to behave like a child. You are 51 years old. It\u2019s time for you to grow up and look outside yourself.", "YTA. You're the father and it's your responsibility to make sure you have a healthy and functioning relationship. Your daughter is 13 yo and even if you were close, her friends would still have priority over you. You sound self entitled and are actively sabotaging your relationship with her.", "\"I didn't see a point in making an effort  if she wasn't going to either.\" YTA. You're the parent, it's literally your job to make an effort! She hurt your feelings so you left without making sure she had a way home? That's childish behavior, and would be expected of a 13 year old, not a 51 year old. Sounds like you stormed off after she hurt your feelings and let her deal with the fallout. How could you not be the AH in this situation? You don't punish a child by abandoning them somewhere because they say something you didn't like.", "Major YTA! \n\nYou could've stayed just out of earshot but followed the group. You should've said \"Okay, but you have to meet me in front of (store or entrance) 5 minutes after closing. But instead you abandon her because you aren't the center of her world. \n\nGuess what? After you finally had a pleasant visit with her, you just proved that every negative belief she had about you was true. Good luck getting her to see you again.", "YTA, shouldn\u2019t leave a 13 year old unsupervised.", "YTA.  Yeah, that strained relationship is cause of you at this point.  It\u2019s clearly all about you and your feelings.  You ruined a good opportunity to earn her trust and build a relationship.  She wanted you to stay and be with her friends.  That\u2019s a big deal in the mind of a 13 year old girl.  Instead you left her alone.  That\u2019s not going to be something she easily forgets.", "On the offchance that this is real, you're a colossal arsehole for pretty much all of this. Abandoning your child like that is a deeply shitty thing to do, and complaining that she wanted to spend time with friends makes you sound like a selfish child. And when you can't even manage to pay for the trip to go and see her? No wonder her mother wanted you out of her life. Grow the fuck up and be a parent, or stop trying to interfere in her life. \n\nYTA. Obviously.", "YTA  You are an adult whining like a five year old.  There are other ways to foster your relationship with your daughter while long distance, especially in these modern times.  You only have a finger to point at everyone else when all you have to do is look in the damn mirror as to why you don't have a good relationship with your child.  Why at the ripe age of 51 haven't you grown up yet?  You left a vulnerable preteen alone at a mall just before closing and you can't see the danger you left her in?  I genuinely feel for your daughter.", "I think that you wanting to be as much separated as possibile from her mother made you lose perspective of the fact that your daughter is a whole person with her own life and friends. \nHer friends, whether they belong to her mother\u2019s place or yours, are a part of her one single complex world and it would have been nice of you to get interested enough to meet them. \nAlso, she\u2019s 13, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve suffered in the past but you are supposed to be the one mature enough to take care of the relationship without these petty reactions. YTA", "So, you want to be the center of attention and only do activities that are fun for you. It sounds like you are the child, not the parent.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYou had the intentions of leaving a minor alone without supervision and, for that matter, made a really, really, REALLY dumb decision. If her friends hadn't been there, anyone could have come around and taken her and done... well, any number of unspeakably horrible things to Ella. 13 is a very ripe age for some shitty people in this world and you don't seem to comprehend the level of danger here. You're lucky - she's lucky to have friends that care about her like this and that understand the danger she was in. That's more mature than a lot of kids her age her. Hell, you're very lucky you still *have* a daughter at all, as far as I see it. \n\nFurther, you do realize that they can probably use this to go back to court and take away even more of your time from her? Especially since she's nearing an age where they may take her preferences into account if they do go back to court, she may now remember this and make an active choice to ask not to be around you at all. Hell, for all you know, that very action may well have confirmed anything her mother or grandmother have said about you. Given your reaction to this incident, I'm wondering if there's a reason you're not revealing for why your visitation rights are as they are now. \n\nLast but not least - you realize how big of a deal it is for 13 year old to even be okay with their dad being around and seeing their friends? Meeting them at all? So many kids aren't okay with that at all even in much more cohesive families. It should be read as a good thing that she wanted you to be around and meet her friends and didn't tell you to go screw off at the nearest coffee kiosk or whatever.", "YTA\n\nIf you love her, you would do everything to be involved in her life. She's the child, she has different ideas of having fun and considering the fact that you got payed to visit her i simply cannot understand why couldn't you stay nearby while she talks with her friends.\n\nLeaving a minor alone isn't what a good parent does. And you already knew the mall closes in 1 hour - it's not like you had anything else to do.\n\nNow your daughter knows that you really don't care about her.", "You poor thing. How wronged you\u2019ve been! You are truly the victim! Nefarious children are the worst !!\n\nThis can\u2019t be real\nYTA", "YTA. Seriously during the second paragraph I had to go back and check ages because I suddenly wasn't sure anymore whether this comes from a parent's or a child's perspective. You need to grow up and you absolutely shouldn't abandon your teenage daughter in a mall because you're hurt about not getting enough attention. You feel so self righteous but this should have been about your daughter. Ok she met friends, good for her, sit in a cafe and when she's ready you ask her whether she was happy to meet them and whether they told her something interesting. Now she'll just think that her father abandon her in ashopping mall, which is fully correct. Your the father she barely sees and you are not a priority. Live with that. Get over yourself and stop being so childish, you're the parent", "YTA what are you, a child? stop acting like one.", "Yta.", "YTA. But I can congratulate you on soon becoming a non parental figure for your daughter. Your ex and your daughter have every reason now to go NC.", "YTA.

Not surprised that your relationship is so strained.", "YTA and quite frankly you sound immature and are taking out the hate you feel towards her mother on to Ella! Take some freaking interest in the things she likes. Yeah you might find them boring or uninteresting but if you truly want bonding time you\u2019ll do it! The amount of crap my parents had to sit through with me and my sibling that they probably found less than amusing but they did it why because they wanted us happy and they wanted to feel included even if they had no clue what they were doing.\n\nLast be honest with yourself OP you are still mad at her mom and just want her to hurt and your taking it out on Ella", "YTA You left a 13yr old girl at the mall near closing time.

Her mother divorced me when she was a baby, and did everything in her power to keep Ella away from me, even moving to a different state when Ella was 2. I only got a visitation of 8 days a month until she was old enough to start elementary school, and after that, only school breaks/long weekends. From the time the visitation started, Ella made it clear that she hated visiting me. She would never listen to me, arguing with me about my rules or outright breaking them. When she was really little and I would pick her up for a visit from the airport, she would cry and scream to stay with her mother and grandmother (I tried my best to cut her contact with her mother\u2019s side during my visitations to foster our relationship without interference, but I wasn\u2019t always able to, and it led to her being much too dependent on them, while also allowing them to influence her against me). As she\u2019s gotten older, it\u2019s been even more difficult to get her to come visit me where I live, so I\u2019ve been going to visit her, instead (thankfully, her mother pays for all my travel expenses).  \n\nThat brings us to now. I flew up to visit Ella. We went to the mall an hour or so before closing time. It was one of our better visits, she was pleasant and talkative, but while we were walking through the food court, she happened to see some friends of hers. Apparently, the friends had graduated from middle school the year before, so she hadn\u2019t seen them in a while. All Ella wanted to do was hangout with them. She barely even noticed me anymore, wanting to go to some store with the group, so I told her I was leaving. She asked me to stay but I refused. Why should I stay when I wasn\u2019t her priority? I\u2019d traveled all the way to see her and the moment her friends showed up, she didn\u2019t care about me anymore. I didn\u2019t want to spend my time chaperoning while she socialized with them instead of me. So I left and went back to my hotel.\n\nHer mother called me the next day and yelled at me for leaving her at the mall. Apparently, the friends had been about to leave, and since the mall was closing, Ella had to wait outside in the dark until her mother and grandmother could come pick her up, which scared her. But her friends agreed to stay with her while she waited, so it\u2019s not like she was alone. And the mall was only about 10 minutes from her house, so she didn\u2019t have to wait for long. She just really hurt me by choosing her friends over spending time with me, just like she chooses everyone else over me, and I didn\u2019t see the point in making an effort if she wasn\u2019t going to, either.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s about what\u2019s in the best interest of the child.\n\nIt\u2019s called being a parent. Might want to try it.", "Okay but here\u2019s the thing\u2026she\u2019s not happy spending time with you. Why? Because you don\u2019t care about her and her feelings. You only care about yourself. She has given you so many opportunities to build trust and respect, but you\u2019re more concerned with sticking it to her mom. That\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t like you.", "And this attitude right here is why your going to lose custody, any custody you have. A judge will look at your behaviour and see you have zero regard for your child\u2019s safety or comfort. Your ex pays your travel expenses to facilitate contact in a comfortable and family environment for your child.", "Why should she be happy to spend time with you? You have to be someone she wants to spend time with. \n\nBeing a biological parent doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s just going to want to spend time with you.", "WHY? \n\nHow have you shown Ella that you are someone she \u2018should\u2019 be happy to see? \n\nYou are not owed her affection just because you are her \u2018father\u2019 (I use that term loosely since your posts have shown you are NOT a dad and don\u2019t seem to comprehend what it means to be one)\n\nYour attitude is that Ella exists for you. Your responsibility is to her, not the other way round.", "Yes it is. As long as screen time is being monitored and isn\u2019t excessive that\u2019s normal. I grew up playing my gameboy, how is a switch any different? You seem very reluctant to actually ask your kid what she wants to do when you spend time together, and the one thing she wants (playing games together) you refuse to do. Honestly if you continue like this you might not have a relationship with your daughter once she\u2019s 18 and custody isn\u2019t a thing anymore. Try harder for her and for your relationship.", "Kids should also foster things that they\u2019re interested in. I was going to give you the benefit of the doubt but yeah\u2026 YTA. Luck to you, you\u2019ll need it.", "If course they SHOULD, but you can only force them to a certain degree. \n\nAlso there are enough games, where you actually learn skills, which can be useful in later life. Nobody said you should play with her 3 hours a day. But by that there would be something you do together, which you can also do, when she stays with her mother.\n\nSometimes you have to set principles aside and do what is best for the situation. Perfect is the evil twin of good.", "So you only want to take care of her when and how it suits you? Yeah thats not a parent maybe she sensed you didnt like her when she was luttke and thats why she didnt want to be with you.", "At a mall a 10 minute walk from her mom's house, after she chose to stay with her friends rather than leave with him... Idk. Maybe I'm wrong.  Without more info, I'm sticking with Everyone Sucks.", "She paid?! Ohhh I missed that! That is a good point", "Thank you, I deleted my original comment. I'm also kicking myself off the internet and sending my a$$ to sleep...\nOr at least putting myself on Read Only mode!", "Yeah, this post is pretty dismal.  The odds of OP coming back from this one are pretty low. \n\nMoral of the story: do not let relationship fallout ruin your other relationships.", "I took her to the zoo when she was 10 and visiting me over the summer. She just got mad at me because I had previously promised to let her sleep in on Saturday, but changed my mind so we could go. Her bad attitude ruined the day.", "I didn\u2019t lie. I changed my mind.", "She told me she wanted a divorce, and when I told her that there wouldn\u2019t be one, she left while I was at work without telling me and taking Ella with her. Then she moved when Ella was 2 to a state that was 2 hours away by plane so that I could only see her for a week a month.", "A ten minute drive you mean, which would be multiple hours walking in the dark\u2026.and she\u2019s 13. I\u2019m really flabbergasted how you see nothing wrong with this.", "So you promised her something, then took it back to fit an agenda you had decided on? Why couldn\u2019t you go later and let her sleep in? No nice way to word it, in this instance you broke her trust and a promise. It seems it\u2019s an ongoing pattern with you and it seems to be fair she doesn\u2019t trust/want to spend time with you..", "Also, her \u201cbad attitude\u201d didn\u2019t ruin the day. Your inability to be consistent and reliable did.", "You couldn\u2019t of gone Sunday or a different day? It had to be the day she wanted to sleep in. No wonder she doesn\u2019t have a relationship with you. You parent under conditions and if they aren\u2019t met you throw a fit and get salter than the sea.", "Just stop commenting...\n\nGoing into your profile and reading all your me, me, me comments is just ridiculous for a 51!!! year old person. You are just selfish and this is another proof.\n\nIf I get told, yeah Saturday we will sleep in and then i get woken up to go anywhere, I will be pissed. And rightfully so. Only excuse would be an emergency, and this was clearly not the case.\n\nThe reactions from her where fully justified.\n\nAnd then being resentful to her, to write this down 3 year later. To show her \"bad attitude\". She has now 33% more lifespan on her shoulders than 3 years ago. This would be aquivalent to resenting you for stuff you did when 38 years old.", "She\u2019s not ten anymore. There\u2019s a huge developmental difference between ten and 13. She doesn\u2019t want to be treated like a baby.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nThat\u2019s not how a child sees it. And once you\u2019ve told them something, you need to keep your word. \n\nAs far as she\u2019s concerned, you lied to her.", "It probably did seem like a lie to her, though.", "\u201ctold her there wouldn\u2019t be one\u201d (WTF?!)\n\nSo.. we all see WHY your wife left you now.\n\nClearly, she was right to run.", "Ten minute drive would be hella messed up agreed!\n\nI just, kinda sympathize with how it feels to make someone a priority when they make you an option.\n\nBut actually if he left her that far from home, that's an AH move. Y'all are pointing out details I missed and I should have read through more thoroughly before commenting, thanks.", "I\u2019m the parent and she\u2019s the child. She should do what I say, when I say it, regardless of any promises.", "I\u2019m the parent, she\u2019s the child. She should do what I say.", "Woahhh buddy. She should do what you say, I guess. She is the child indeed and you are the parent. However, the thing your doing is fostering resentment. I don\u2019t think your daughter wants to be viewed as someone you can disregard promises to \u201cjust because she\u2019s your child\u201d. Honestly, It\u2019s unsurprising she doesn\u2019t want to be around you if you\u2019re so disregarding of her feelings. to sum it up, you don\u2019t care about your child\u2019s feelings. You want to feel like a good parent, and put none of the emotional work or bonding into it. YTA and you\u2019re going down the route of an asshole dad or possibly NC", "No wonder her mother left you. You sound very controlling. You should consider therapy.", "Thats why she doesnt like you and doesnt want to spend any time eith you because YTA that doesnt care about his daughter.. its not about you anymore its about her everything is supposed to be about her.", "Oh, ffs, grow up. \n\nThat is not how it works. \n\nAll you\u2019re doing is building resentment and showing her that she can\u2019t trust you.", "This is a joke right ? How to create resentment and become fully estranged from your child 101. \nYou\u2019re a terrible and immature \u201cparent\u201d", "If you carry on with that attitude, she\u2019s going to decide to go no contact with you as soon as she gets the chance. From everything you\u2019ve said you don\u2019t seem to bring any joy into her life.\n\nI love my dad - we have a great relationship - do I think he enjoyed playing barbies with me when I was small, or sitting around for an hour when I went to tap class\u2026 probably not. But he did it because he took advantage of all the opportunities he could to bond with me on my terms. Do better!", "Yikes, it\u2019s this attitude that will ensure your kid never has a relationship with you as an adult", "A boss, who has to say \"I am the boss\" is not a good boss..", "Good luck with that I can see why your divorced! Have fun once she is 18 because you\u2019ll never hear from her again!", "Lol. \n\nYou\u2019re delusional. \n\nWhat you describe is control. You barely have a relationship with her. It\u2019s completely unreasonable to think she\u2019s just going to blindly do as she\u2019s told.  \n\nShe\u2019s a teenager. This is the age when friends are more important than their parents. \n\nYou claim you\u2019re the parent? Then maybe you should start acting like one. A parent doesn\u2019t just leave their kid at the mall.", "Well you are clearly a BAD parent, mostly because you are narcissistic, selfish, and honestly not a very smart person. So because I'm clearly more intelligent then you, you should do what I say. You want to act like a child, I'll be your daddy."]}
