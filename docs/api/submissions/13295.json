{"id": 13295, "submission_id": "123fex3", "title": "AITA for leaving my (51M) daughter (13F) at the mall?", "selftext": "For context, my daughter, Ella, and I have always had a strained relationship. Her mother divorced me when she was a baby, and did everything in her power to keep Ella away from me, even moving to a different state when Ella was 2. I only got a visitation of 8 days a month until she was old enough to start elementary school, and after that, only school breaks/long weekends. From the time the visitation started, Ella made it clear that she hated visiting me. She would never listen to me, arguing with me about my rules or outright breaking them. When she was really little and I would pick her up for a visit from the airport, she would cry and scream to stay with her mother and grandmother (I tried my best to cut her contact with her mother\u2019s side during my visitations to foster our relationship without interference, but I wasn\u2019t always able to, and it led to her being much too dependent on them, while also allowing them to influence her against me). As she\u2019s gotten older, it\u2019s been even more difficult to get her to come visit me where I live, so I\u2019ve been going to visit her, instead (thankfully, her mother pays for all my travel expenses).  \n\nThat brings us to now. I flew up to visit Ella. We went to the mall an hour or so before closing time. It was one of our better visits, she was pleasant and talkative, but while we were walking through the food court, she happened to see some friends of hers. Apparently, the friends had graduated from middle school the year before, so she hadn\u2019t seen them in a while. All Ella wanted to do was hangout with them. She barely even noticed me anymore, wanting to go to some store with the group, so I told her I was leaving. She asked me to stay but I refused. Why should I stay when I wasn\u2019t her priority? I\u2019d traveled all the way to see her and the moment her friends showed up, she didn\u2019t care about me anymore. I didn\u2019t want to spend my time chaperoning while she socialized with them instead of me. So I left and went back to my hotel.\n\nHer mother called me the next day and yelled at me for leaving her at the mall. Apparently, the friends had been about to leave, and since the mall was closing, Ella had to wait outside in the dark until her mother and grandmother could come pick her up, which scared her. But her friends agreed to stay with her while she waited, so it\u2019s not like she was alone. And the mall was only about 10 minutes from her house, so she didn\u2019t have to wait for long. She just really hurt me by choosing her friends over spending time with me, just like she chooses everyone else over me, and I didn\u2019t see the point in making an effort if she wasn\u2019t going to, either.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679902654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123fex3/aita_for_leaving_my_51m_daughter_13f_at_the_mall/", "score": 363, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wanted to be with her friends AND YOU at the same time! For goodness sake, she asked you to stay! You had a great opportunity to see your daughter with friends in her natural element. But you ruined it, you absolutely ruined that chance to show your daughter how much you care.", "JFC YTA and a major one at that on so many levels. Who just abandons their child? It\u2019s clear that you really only care about yourself and your feelings and not your daughter\u2019s. You got overly emotional that your daughter wanted to talk to her friends? Spending time with her isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about her. You had a chance to cultivate your relationship but instead you got caught up in your feelings and acted like a petulant child. It\u2019s no wonder why your daughter doesn\u2019t like spending time with you.", "YTA   \n\n\nYou are the adult here. You shoud've communicated and said \"Hey, I get it that you want to hang out with friends but I was really looknig forward to our alone time\" or you could've offered a fun activity. She is a child of course she would rather hang out with friends, weren't you the same at 13? Regardless, have you thought about a reason why you are not that close? It's the choice of words that's bothering me. It seems like you are blaming everyone for the lack of relationships with her but yourself.", "INFO: Your ex did everything in her power to keep Ella away from you, except she pays for your travel costs to visit? To me, it sounds like she didn't keep the kid away from you. She's actually facilitating your relationship in a way that costs her money.\n\nWhat am I missing?", "She's a child and you're an adult not the other way around.\n\n\" She barely even noticed me anymore, wanting to go to some store with the group, so I told her I was leaving.

She could have easily been abducted from that mall and anything could have happened to her? How would  you have felt? By the sounds of things you wouldn't care so why don't you just cut contact with the daughter you don't even like, pay child support and leave her alone.", "YTA\n\nShe is 13 yrs old. You don't leave her at the mall with no way home. She asked you to stay. Good luck getting her to see you again.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re a parent. Your kid is going to hurt you sometimes. I understand that you\u2019ve had a really rocky relationship with your daughter, but that\u2019s a 13 year old who hadn\u2019t seen her friends in a while and you\u2019re a grown adult. You should be lucky that your daughter wanted you to be there while she hung out with her friends. A lot of teenagers would want their parents gone for that. She trusted you, and you broke that trust. Whether she chooses someone else over you is irrelevant. Your job is to keep her safe and be there when she needs you. Grow up, act your age, and apologize to your daughter.", "YTA, why would you leave your child alone at the mall? Especially when you knew it was closing very soon and she would have no way of going home. \n\nThis also doesn't help on improving your relationship with your daughter since this doesn't seem like a great experience for her.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2018re an adult, and you should be capable of communicating properly. You can\u2018t just leave your child at the mall, this is abandonement and you just proved that you aren\u2019t a good parent.", "YTA You were petty and abandoned her because you felt abandoned. Congratulations on giving your ex all the ammo she'll ever need, without ever needing to say a word against you. What you should have said was \"I'll be waiting at x location\" or \"text me when your done talking with your friends\"", "If that trip was one of the more \u201cpleasant ones\u201d as you say, then you should have been more open on maybe getting to know her friends more.  After all, aren\u2019t Ella\u2019s friends people you\u2019d want to know in the first place?\n\nLeaving her gives off apathetic, disconnected, and even immature vibes, and tells me that you might be contributing to the tensions more than you let on.\n\nIt\u2019s time to end the wallowing self-pity party, step up, and be an engaged and loving father, to the extent you can with the time you have.  YTA.", "Fuck you as if you leave your 13 year old daughter at the mall. As I parent I can\u2019t begin to explain just how immature you were having a hissy over her running into friends. You\u2019re a pathetic excuse for a father", "YTA. i understand why she doesn\u2019t like spending time with you. what were you fucking thinking when leaving her alone when mall was about to close? especially when she asked you to stay.\n\nshe is a 13 year old, not you. quit whining about \u201cnot feeling like a priority\u201d and leaving a 13 year old alone like that.", "YTA\n\nYou left your kid at the mall when she wasn't paying enough attention to you. Read that again.  No wonder she'd rather be with other people.", "Yta; you\u2019re the adult and she\u2019s your child- it\u2019s up to you to make the effort because you\u2019re her dad. Why can\u2019t you or don\u2019t you pay for your own travel to see your child? It\u2019s not kind of you to have left her there when she asked you to stay either", "YTA. You are an adult and a father. Sometimes you have to put with things like that. You dont just leave a child at the store because you didn't pay attention to you", "YTA for getting your back up and throwing a wobble because your CHILD saw her friends at a mall and wanted to see them too. Friends are just as important as family, it's not like she makes a habit of it and at most, would have taken an hour. You are an adult yet you acted like a stroppy teen who was left out. Kidnappings happen in seconds so what you did was extremely stupid.", "YTA\n\n\nYou knew the mall was closing shortly. \"I didn't want to spend my time chaperoning\"(even only for a very short time)... you seemingly don't see yourself as her parent.\n\n\n\n- you not being the center of her attention for every second of that day is not a crime done by her. \n\n\n- you seem to have no interest in what kind of people your kids hang out with. Something that highly influences her behaviour and future. \n\n\n- you seem to not feel responsible for her safty- as a parent you are\n\n\n\nTo me this is 100% on you and that you don't feel as an actual father\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\n\nYour comments are a dumster fire.\n\n\n You don't want her to stay over night ever. Still you expected an equal parenting role for her. That is not how that works.\n\n\nYou don't want to have anything to do with friends the mother of your child also knows. Your daughter is one single person. Just because you don't like her mother, she is requiered to live to sperated lifes. You again aliented yourself.\n\n\n Your wife left you secretly because you wouldn't participate in a mature seperation. If someone is breaking up with you, you can not tell them no and it is werid that you still think your wife should've been forced to stay.", "How can you write these lines and think you are not TA..\n\nYTA - of course.\n\nYou are a grown man and your daughter is a young teenager. Of course her friends are much more fun than her dad, she barely sees. From what you write it must feel like a chore to her. Of course this whole situation is awful for you. At first it is quite a pleasent trip and then she rejects you. You are not TA for feeling bad and not necessarily for her not feeling comfortable around you. This can be your own faults from the past but also interferences from her mom and grandmom. We don't know.\n\nBut you are a massive AH for leaving her alone in the mall. She will remember this and not in a good way. I was once forgotten to pick up from sports by my parents, or rather picked up quite late. I wasnt scared, but i still remember that, although it is probably 25 years or more ago, and that was by mistake. Your did this on purpose.", "YTA \n\nI understand that she hurt your feelings, but *you* are adult. *You* are supposed to put your feelings aside and realize she\u2019s a young teenager. As an adult *you* should remember that social groups and interactions are very important at that age.\n\nInstead of waiting patiently for it to run its course you pouted like a child.\n\n*She* is the child, not you. You can indulge your hurt feelings later when you\u2019re alone.", "YTA. You sound exactly like my ex and my daughter is exactly like yours down to the screaming not to leave with her father when she was younger. Don\u2019t expect a future relationship. If I was mom, I\u2019d be in court so fast your head would spin. You put your daughter in danger because she was being a normal teen. When my daughter sees her friends, she forgets I am there too. You know what I do? I grab a seat nearby and wait. Or I say I\u2019m getting something from the food court and I will be right back. I would never consider leaving her, even if I was mad or she hurt my feelings.", "Wow, YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re using the fact that things just so happened to turn out okay to defend your actions, which are: you *abandoned* a *child* you were *responsible for*. If those friends had left earlier and she was left alone after dark at a closed mall, you might have major consequences to worry about for her and for you. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s this sort of thing that makes her hate your visits. You want approval and appreciation from her. You need to make a way better case for yourself than you\u2019re making. You need to not, for example? storm off in a huff in response to her wanting to catch up with people she hadn\u2019t seen in longer than it\u2019s been since she\u2019s last seen you. \n\nSeriously, dude, grow up and earn the goddamn respect you think you\u2019re entitled to.", "YTA. Upto the moment you left her  I was on your side. You have now lost your daughter. She will not want to see you next visitation, and all the evil badmouthing your ex has probably done, your daughter will believe. Your ex is probably really happy to have won the war.", "YTA. \n\nSo first, your daughter is a child and so much of this behavior is normal for a child. \n\nA week away from her mother and everything she knows is difficult and purposefully cutting off contact during a scary, tumultuous time for a kid, is crappy. It could\u2019ve provided your daughter a modicum of comfort, which might\u2019ve made the whole situation a lot easier on everyone. Also, it\u2019s ok for a child to be dependent on their parent. It\u2019s kind of the whole parent child relationship deal. \n\nNow, to the present day issue. Your daughter ran into friends she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time and ignored you. This is pretty understandable behavior for most people, especially for a thirteen year old. You don\u2019t mention it here, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if you returned to your hotel without even notifying your daughter. She\u2019s 13 years old. You already have a shaky relationship and your behavior just proves that your love is conditional on her paying attention to you. At such a young age, there should be no conditions on the care and affection you give her. You shouldn\u2019t be holding your issues with your ex against your daughter. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t even begin to address the issue of leaving a child at the mall by herself. A ton of things could happen in \u201conly ten minutes.\u201d Her physical safety could\u2019ve been in jeopardy, not to mention her emotional safety was definitely traumatized here. \n\nYou are the parent. She is the child. She is allowed to behave like a child. You are 51 years old. It\u2019s time for you to grow up and look outside yourself.", "YTA. You're the father and it's your responsibility to make sure you have a healthy and functioning relationship. Your daughter is 13 yo and even if you were close, her friends would still have priority over you. You sound self entitled and are actively sabotaging your relationship with her.", "\"I didn't see a point in making an effort  if she wasn't going to either.\" YTA. You're the parent, it's literally your job to make an effort! She hurt your feelings so you left without making sure she had a way home? That's childish behavior, and would be expected of a 13 year old, not a 51 year old. Sounds like you stormed off after she hurt your feelings and let her deal with the fallout. How could you not be the AH in this situation? You don't punish a child by abandoning them somewhere because they say something you didn't like.", "Major YTA! \n\nYou could've stayed just out of earshot but followed the group. You should've said \"Okay, but you have to meet me in front of (store or entrance) 5 minutes after closing. But instead you abandon her because you aren't the center of her world. \n\nGuess what? After you finally had a pleasant visit with her, you just proved that every negative belief she had about you was true. Good luck getting her to see you again.", "YTA, shouldn\u2019t leave a 13 year old unsupervised.", "YTA.  Yeah, that strained relationship is cause of you at this point.  It\u2019s clearly all about you and your feelings.  You ruined a good opportunity to earn her trust and build a relationship.  She wanted you to stay and be with her friends.  That\u2019s a big deal in the mind of a 13 year old girl.  Instead you left her alone.  That\u2019s not going to be something she easily forgets.", "On the offchance that this is real, you're a colossal arsehole for pretty much all of this. Abandoning your child like that is a deeply shitty thing to do, and complaining that she wanted to spend time with friends makes you sound like a selfish child. And when you can't even manage to pay for the trip to go and see her? No wonder her mother wanted you out of her life. Grow the fuck up and be a parent, or stop trying to interfere in her life. \n\nYTA. Obviously.", "YTA  You are an adult whining like a five year old.  There are other ways to foster your relationship with your daughter while long distance, especially in these modern times.  You only have a finger to point at everyone else when all you have to do is look in the damn mirror as to why you don't have a good relationship with your child.  Why at the ripe age of 51 haven't you grown up yet?  You left a vulnerable preteen alone at a mall just before closing and you can't see the danger you left her in?  I genuinely feel for your daughter.", "I think that you wanting to be as much separated as possibile from her mother made you lose perspective of the fact that your daughter is a whole person with her own life and friends. \nHer friends, whether they belong to her mother\u2019s place or yours, are a part of her one single complex world and it would have been nice of you to get interested enough to meet them. \nAlso, she\u2019s 13, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve suffered in the past but you are supposed to be the one mature enough to take care of the relationship without these petty reactions. YTA", "So, you want to be the center of attention and only do activities that are fun for you. It sounds like you are the child, not the parent.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYou had the intentions of leaving a minor alone without supervision and, for that matter, made a really, really, REALLY dumb decision. If her friends hadn't been there, anyone could have come around and taken her and done... well, any number of unspeakably horrible things to Ella. 13 is a very ripe age for some shitty people in this world and you don't seem to comprehend the level of danger here. You're lucky - she's lucky to have friends that care about her like this and that understand the danger she was in. That's more mature than a lot of kids her age her. Hell, you're very lucky you still *have* a daughter at all, as far as I see it. \n\nFurther, you do realize that they can probably use this to go back to court and take away even more of your time from her? Especially since she's nearing an age where they may take her preferences into account if they do go back to court, she may now remember this and make an active choice to ask not to be around you at all. Hell, for all you know, that very action may well have confirmed anything her mother or grandmother have said about you. Given your reaction to this incident, I'm wondering if there's a reason you're not revealing for why your visitation rights are as they are now. \n\nLast but not least - you realize how big of a deal it is for 13 year old to even be okay with their dad being around and seeing their friends? Meeting them at all? So many kids aren't okay with that at all even in much more cohesive families. It should be read as a good thing that she wanted you to be around and meet her friends and didn't tell you to go screw off at the nearest coffee kiosk or whatever.", "YTA\n\nIf you love her, you would do everything to be involved in her life. She's the child, she has different ideas of having fun and considering the fact that you got payed to visit her i simply cannot understand why couldn't you stay nearby while she talks with her friends.\n\nLeaving a minor alone isn't what a good parent does. And you already knew the mall closes in 1 hour - it's not like you had anything else to do.\n\nNow your daughter knows that you really don't care about her.", "You poor thing. How wronged you\u2019ve been! You are truly the victim! Nefarious children are the worst !!\n\nThis can\u2019t be real\nYTA", "YTA. Seriously during the second paragraph I had to go back and check ages because I suddenly wasn't sure anymore whether this comes from a parent's or a child's perspective. You need to grow up and you absolutely shouldn't abandon your teenage daughter in a mall because you're hurt about not getting enough attention. You feel so self righteous but this should have been about your daughter. Ok she met friends, good for her, sit in a cafe and when she's ready you ask her whether she was happy to meet them and whether they told her something interesting. Now she'll just think that her father abandon her in ashopping mall, which is fully correct. Your the father she barely sees and you are not a priority. Live with that. Get over yourself and stop being so childish, you're the parent", "YTA what are you, a child? stop acting like one.", "Yta.", "YTA. But I can congratulate you on soon becoming a non parental figure for your daughter. Your ex and your daughter have every reason now to go NC.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if her friends stayed with her or home was ten minutes away, you abandoned your child and that\u2019s unforgivable.", "YTA.", "YTA. Not surprised that your relationship is so strained.", "YTA and quite frankly you sound immature and are taking out the hate you feel towards her mother on to Ella! Take some freaking interest in the things she likes. Yeah you might find them boring or uninteresting but if you truly want bonding time you\u2019ll do it! The amount of crap my parents had to sit through with me and my sibling that they probably found less than amusing but they did it why because they wanted us happy and they wanted to feel included even if they had no clue what they were doing.\n\nLast be honest with yourself OP you are still mad at her mom and just want her to hurt and your taking it out on Ella", "YTA You left a 13yr old girl at the mall near closing time. She was forced to wait outside in the dark for her mother and grandmother to come pick her up. Sure her friends were with her but anything could have still happened to her. Do you not watch the news?

So I\u2019ll just say that you are an asshole of epic proportions.", "YTA and her mother needs to get CPS involved and take you back to court to get full custody. You are a neglectful and irresponsible parent. Your daughter is obviously not safe living with you and I hope her mom takes measures to make sure she doesn't get in that situation again. Your daughter got lucky this time and didn't get kidnapped or murdered in a mall shooting. You do know that those things happen more often now right? It's your responsibility as a parent to look after your child and protect them at all costs.

YTA. Your daughter's 13. You were butthurt she wanted to hang with friends for a few minutes so you abandoned her. Time to grow up and be a better parent, that is if she bothers with you at all. You're supposed to make your kid feel loved and safe. You blew it big time with that stunt.", "YTA. Dude your daughter is THIRTEEN. You don\u2019t get to ditch her as soon as you\u2019re not having fun anymore. You\u2019re the parent of a teenager now and you\u2019re gonna have to get used to being a lower priority than friends because that\u2019s the phase she\u2019s in. Throwing a tantrum and abandoning your kid without any effort to see if she made it home safe is beyond an AH move, it\u2019s literally dangerous.", "OMG such an AH. And all I see from you is excuse after excuse for your neglectfulness as a father, and blaming everyone else, including your 13 year old child, for the strained relationship you have with her. I would not blame your ex-wife if she made sure you never see your daughter again.", "YTA dude. Why would you live your 13 yo daughter at the mall alone without adult supervision. Yes, you travelled all the way to see her but she accidentally met a friend. She has not seen this said friend in a while, it's okay for her to catch up.\n\nShe ASKED you to stay. This is already an indicator that she does want to spend time with you. Also, you left her stranded at the mall??? What is wrong with you. Doesn't matter if the mall was 10 mins away from her house. She's a kid, she's alone, she's scared and you couldn't give a damn about her and her safety.

Her mother divorced me when she was a baby, and did everything in her power to keep Ella away from me, even moving to a different state when Ella was 2. I only got a visitation of 8 days a month until she was old enough to start elementary school, and after that, only school breaks/long weekends. From the time the visitation started, Ella made it clear that she hated visiting me. She would never listen to me, arguing with me about my rules or outright breaking them. When she was really little and I would pick her up for a visit from the airport, she would cry and scream to stay with her mother and grandmother (I tried my best to cut her contact with her mother\u2019s side during my visitations to foster our relationship without interference, but I wasn\u2019t always able to, and it led to her being much too dependent on them, while also allowing them to influence her against me). As she\u2019s gotten older, it\u2019s been even more difficult to get her to come visit me where I live, so I\u2019ve been going to visit her, instead (thankfully, her mother pays for all my travel expenses).  \n\nThat brings us to now. I flew up to visit Ella. We went to the mall an hour or so before closing time. It was one of our better visits, she was pleasant and talkative, but while we were walking through the food court, she happened to see some friends of hers. Apparently, the friends had graduated from middle school the year before, so she hadn\u2019t seen them in a while. All Ella wanted to do was hangout with them. She barely even noticed me anymore, wanting to go to some store with the group, so I told her I was leaving. She asked me to stay but I refused. Why should I stay when I wasn\u2019t her priority? I\u2019d traveled all the way to see her and the moment her friends showed up, she didn\u2019t care about me anymore. I didn\u2019t want to spend my time chaperoning while she socialized with them instead of me. So I left and went back to my hotel.\n\nHer mother called me the next day and yelled at me for leaving her at the mall. Apparently, the friends had been about to leave, and since the mall was closing, Ella had to wait outside in the dark until her mother and grandmother could come pick her up, which scared her. But her friends agreed to stay with her while she waited, so it\u2019s not like she was alone. And the mall was only about 10 minutes from her house, so she didn\u2019t have to wait for long. She just really hurt me by choosing her friends over spending time with me, just like she chooses everyone else over me, and I didn\u2019t see the point in making an effort if she wasn\u2019t going to, either.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If the other CHILDREN hadn\u2019t stayed to protect your CHILD, she may have been in danger. You have zero idea what could happen to her and you didn\u2019t care. That\u2019s not the actions of a father, a guardian or a reasonable adult.\n\nYou do very little to behave like a father, take responsibility for your actions or even simply finance a parental relationship - it\u2019s not magic, it\u2019s not your \u2018due\u2019, you\u2019re not owed a parental relationship - you need to actual DO the actions of a father.

Acknowledge your controlling behaviour - get help, do better.", "INFO: How much do you speak to her on the phone? And have done so since she and her mother moved out of state?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA for abandoning a child at the mall because your feelings were hurt (you should've put her safety first by staying), especially as she asked you to stay.\n\nThe big issue is that you seem to feel entitled to a good relationship with your daughter solely based on the fact that you're her biological father. **A good relationship is something you need to cultivate, it's not something you deserve based on DNA**.\n\nBased on how much she sees you, it was understandable that she would cry and scream after her mother when she was younger because that's her primary parent and the one she feels safe with. A lot of children feel scared in a new environment and she doesn't really know you because you live in another state. Trying to cut off that contact with her to force her to bond with you, was not what she needed, she needed the comfort of something she knew and was familiar to her.\n\nYou then took her to the zoo when she was 10 but say that she ruined the day by throwing a temper tantrum because you woke her up early, despite telling her before bed that she could sleep in. And your defence is that `I\u2019m the parent and she\u2019s the child. She should do what I say, when I say it, regardless of any promises.` She was 10, she wanted to sleep and you promised her a sleep in, of course she's going to throw a temper tantrum if she's tired and you went back on your word. Being a parent does not mean you can dictate her feelings, and that's how children express their frustration.\n\nAnd now at 13, you say that she `never wants to hang out with you` and when you do she `only wants to play Nintendo Switch` and `not do anything fun`. But playing Nintendo Switch is **fun for her**. Yes, it may not be healthy for children to spend all their time at home on electronics, but you only see her a few days a month, you don't know what she does with the rest of her time - and instead of arguing with your daughter, you should do what makes her happy and spend time with her.\n\n>She should be happy to spend time with me. She shouldn\u2019t need her mother when she has me.\n\nShe's not happy because she doesn't know you (as well as she knows her mother), and you're not putting in any effort to get to know her and what makes her happy. Instead you keep putting your own feelings first, but what you should be doing is **prioritise your daughter**. She wants to play Nintendo Switch, play Nintendo Switch with her, she wants to go to the mall, go to the mall with her. You can make suggestions and try to come up with other fun activities you can do together, but it should be about her happiness and wellbeing. Stop trying to force a relationship on your daughter that is solely on your terms, you'll only end up pushing her further away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Edit: Added question at the top*", "In case you didn't get the memo from the other hundreds of redditors here: YTA. \n\nYou have all these people here trying to make it abundantly clear that you behavior isn't that of a good father figure, and you still choose to make up excuses for yourself and how you are the victim. No wonder your ex left you and didn't tell you before she reached her parents. I'm starting to think she really didn't feel like explaining her reasons to someone who doesn't listen anyway and she probably already had a pretty good guess of how you would be like as a father. It's really up to you to be a good father for your kid and you do that by listening to what she needs from you, not what you need from her. \n\nYou're telling us she doesn't want to spend time with you and hates you, and then I read she wanted to play the switch with you. To me that sounds like she is trying to establish a bond with you in a way that makes her feel comfortable. Instead you still resent her for not wanting to go to the zoo with you when she was 10. It makes you sound more childish than her. I highly doubt her mom only gets to do things she wants either as primary caregiver. And just because you only see her a few days a month doesn't mean you're entitled to only fun stuff if your really want to be her father.\n\nIn another post you're telling us you don't care about who her 'mom-time' friends are. Sorry but how stupid is that? Why wouldn't you want to know that part of your daughter? They also help shape who she becomes and even though you think she doesn't like you, she probably still wants her friends to know who her dad is. And maybe (et's hope not) something ever happens to your daughter or she runs away. Wouldn't you be at all interested in who you should call, or that just her moms problem then?\n\nKids/teens act out, they will probably not tell you to your face they like or need you, but they do. Or at least she wants to like you, because kids generally do want a stable father figure. It's your responsibility to be there for her. Even if it's just in the background. Knowing you're there for her is enough to get her to like you eventually. \n\nYou could've stayed there and tell her to be back in 10 minutes, you could've offered to buy them all ice cream and get to know them.

Instead, you left her behind with nothing.", ">Why should I stay when I wasn\u2019t her priority?

Don't be surprised when, because of your lack of affection for her, she goes no contact in 5 years. It's your job to facilitate yalls relationship. Whether that meant counseling, or whatever.  I agree with what was said here, teenagers love to hang with thier friends.  She actually invited you along (do you know how rare that is?!?).

When I would go over for visitation he wouldn\u2019t include me in anything because he didn\u2019t like his own daughters but could play father figure to someone else\u2019s.

Trust is important in any relationship and if a parent can\u2019t be trusted, how can they do what\u2019s best for their child. \nGrow up. YTA", "When do you plan on starting?", "Going or the zoo isn\u2019t a \u201cbest for her\u201d decision, it\u2019s a weekend activity", "It absolutely is your job as a parent to keep promises. \n\nBreaking promises is the fastest way to destroy your relationship. It teaches children that you are not to be trusted, that your word is meaningless, and that they can\u2019t count on you. They also don\u2019t respect you. \n\nSo congratulations on being an absolutely, astoundingly crappy parent.", "Isn\u2019t part of doing what\u2019s best for her is to model good behaviour? What does that teach your daughter?", "Same! Every comment just makes it worse.", "So what you're saying is that you TRIED to force her to be in a relationship with you against her will, you just weren't successful in it. \n\nYou know what, keep acting how you are towards your daughter. She'll cut contact at 18 and be better for not having you in her life anymore.", "You do realize you are admitting to wanting, and trying, to FORCE someone to stay with you, right?\n\nYour ex didn\u2019t want you. Didn\u2019t want to stay with you. So\u2026 your choice was to attempt to make her anyway?\n\nAnd\u2026 you don\u2019t see the problem with this? (John Jamelske didn\u2019t either\u2026)", "So you refused to give her a get until you faced societal pressure?", "Somehow the more and more comments you make, the more and more convinced I am that you were abusive towards your ex - especially since it sounds like she did the classic disconnect that abuse victims will do to make sure that they can get out of a relationship safely AND the fact that you sound very controlling in regards to your daughter.\n\nNow I'm hoping this blows up and your ex finds this shit. I imagine these comments of yours would be *absolutely riveting* for a judge to read in a new custody hearing.", "This is the second comment I\u2019ve read from you claiming that someone was biased against you. You think that maybe their decisions are deserved? You come across really poorly as a husband, father and quite frankly human. YTA. Stop trying to control your child and try to build a relationship with her. One of love, not obedience. It\u2019s not too late, but in a few years it will be.", "And the judge was biased against you...seems like everyone is against you, according to you.   \n\n\nActing like children are dolls that should do exactly as you say a.) does not work b.) generally involves being cut out of their life as they grow up.", "Holy fuck dude. Can you hear yourself!? Are you in your 50\u2019s or your teens? YTA", "Too bad it's \"AITA\" and not \"AITPOS\" because omg you're one of those abusive possessive delusional \"men\" that refuses to provide the get unless pressured by a rabbi and STILL thinks he's done nothing wrong. You may be beyond redemption.", "Riiiight. The judge was biased. The rabbi was biased. Everyone is just out to get you, right? Lol\n\nSuch a delusional AH you are. \n\nYou\u2019re the common denominator here.", "Good thing it's already done. any biet din would compel you to divorce her after seeing this post, sheesh. You're not performing as a father.", "Yeah, you already said that. But were you reliable on this times. Or weree you also changing your mind, similar to the zoo incident.", "There are LOTS of places in the US where you can't walk home from a mall. If that was \"10 minutes\" by car, that could be an easy 45+ minutes walking, and we have no idea if there were sidewalks along that route or if it was otherwise safe. As far as buses go, there's no guarantee at all that the mall has a bus stop or even that the city has adequate enough transit to have bus service then. If they do, it could still be an hour wait for a bus, and it's unlikely she's familiar with riding it, so she might not even think about it, know where to wait for it, or know where to find a bus schedule/map so she can figure out which one to take.", "I was being sarcastic.\n\nI don\u2019t think OP did anything tragic here.", "I mean I'd hope all she has to do is testify about him leaving her in the mall. Especially given OP seems dead set on he's right. Seems a slam dunk never have to see him again to me.", "He never raised her, so he is trying enforce control where he can.\n\nI'm so \"shocked\" the girls mom tried to keep her from him. His rules might have been fucked up that was bad for both the mother and the daughter. \n\nI wish OP might actually learn something form this post, if he wants to actually have a relationship with his daughter and not just tell others it's not his fault that he has no contact with his daughter. \n\nOPs like this never say \"I was too controlling and drove my daughter away\" no, it will be \"her mother kept me away from her and the daughter didn't want a relationship with me, woe is me\"", "I'm honestly hoping this incident is the final nail in the coffin and mom can get full custody with no visitation. That's what would be best for this kid.", "He\u2019s deliberately triggering her anxiety. It\u2019s just pure cruelty.", "I didn\u2019t want to get divorced in the first place, so why should I have given her a get? Most people don\u2019t even try to get one until they\u2019re about to be remarried and she wasn\u2019t, so she was just being petty and twisting the knife more. Why should I have given her that satisfaction?", "why do i get the feeling that the ex is willing to shell out the $$ to fly his disgusting ass out to visit because the daughter was terrified for her own safety when she was staying with him? what an abhorrent excuse of a person"]}
