Your mom looks like a sweet, caring person, and that's all that count.", "NTA wife seems a little pushy.", "NTA. Your moms love language sounds like it resonates with showing you *how* she feels not telling you which is actually much more sincere. \n\nGiven the age gap in your relationship it\u2019s incredibly insecure of your spouse to insist that unless she hears the words *\u2019I love you\u2019* she\u2019ll never be sure where she stands with her MIL and why she needs to do desperately hear that is for her to sort out. \n\nHowever, you may want to remind her that all the other DIL\u2019s have accepted her way of showing her love for everyone and unless she starts to embrace the ebb and flow of her way of being, she\u2019s doing nothing more than creating a wedge between all of you and making herself look immature while being the elder partner in your relationship.", "NTA- your mom is allowed to be who she is. Your moms not being unkind. Your wife sounds exhausting, needy and emotionally immature probably why a 35 year old sought out a younger spouse. Tell her to grow up not everyone has to be vomit praise and emotions all over her.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m very similar to your Mom and can totally understand where she is coming from. (My husbands family overwhelms me constantly with the forced affection)\nAs long as she treats your wife with kindness and respect, that\u2019s all that should be expected. In the nicest way possible, if your wife needs more validation than that, that\u2019s her problem.", "NTA your wife needs to understand that not everyone is willing or able to show love in the way she demands it.  What happens if you have a kid that is shy or just different?", "NTA.  Your wife is every overbearing coworker who gets huffy when the guy who loathes birthdays gets angry when  the unwanted office party goes over like a lead balloon.  Consider this silent treatment a gift.", "NTAYour wife is being immature and weird. I understand that your wife wants a loving relationship with your mom, but your mom just isn't like that. Your mom has an issue with expressing herself in general, let alone with your wife. Assuming your wife knows this, she should understand and respect it.\n\nLet's say for instance, you DID try and nudge your mom to say 'I love you' to your wife (which would overall be a weird ass request IMO), and your mom did, it wouldn't be genuine now, would it? No, because it would be forced, and not meaningful at all because your mom would just be doing it for you, not because she loves your wife (and who knows, she might not love her like that anyway and that's okay)", "Considering the MiL's from hell we all hear about, you should be lucky your inlaws accept you, let alone love.", "NTA \n\nYou're mum shouldn't need to change to suit your wife's demands. By saying your wife is bubbly and craves words of affirmation makes it sound like she's completely obnoxious. Especially when she cannot understand that your mum should not need to bend her entire character/personality to cater to her.", "NTA.  But your whole shit is a mess.  Your wife's need for unreasonable affirmation from your mom coupled with the age gap is trouble. You simply do not have enough life experience to be an equal partner in this relationship. She's going to blind side you with shit you never saw coming.  I guarantee you're back here in 2 years asking us if you should go no contact with a family member because your wife is upset.       If I were you I'd run.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Your mother treats your wife well, she even sends packages which she wouldn't have to. That is more your wife could ever demand from her.

Your mom respects her and is kind to her, so she isn't doing anything wrong.   \n\n\nYour mom isn't obligated to have some kind of special personal relationship to your wife just as you weren't obligated to have some kind of special relationship to her spouse if she should ever chose to marry again.", "You don\u2019t know what your mother feels", "A lot pushy", "This.

Then we will see a thread where the mom will act clueless why the kid who they did EVERYTHING for went no contact at 18."]}
