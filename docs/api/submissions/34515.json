She rarely speaks but she is constantly sends over care packages such as homemade soap and cookie kits ect and things she thinks that we will like like books or figurines ect.\n\nNow because she is so shy she doesn\u2019t like to hang out with our spouses by herself because she feels awkward without us. \n\nAll my other siblings spouses get it and they don\u2019t mind. Because again she does make sure to buy things she knows they will like and show love in different ways. But since she is shy, she is not openly affectionate even with us. \n\n\nNow my wife has always been a bubbly person and she craves words of affirmation. But she is convinced that my mom hates her because my mom hasn\u2019t said I love you too her. I don\u2019t want to push my mom into speaking when she doesn\u2019t want to. \n\nI have told my wife multiple times that my mom does like her. The reason I say like is because my mom did have some reservations because I\u2019m 23 and my wife is 35 but she overcame that.\n\nMy wife wants to her my mom say that she loves her. But I\u2019m not going to force my mom too because I don\u2019t want to dictate anything to my mom cuz she doesn\u2019t treat my wife  differently to any other spouse. She always sends care packages every month with things she knows my wife likes. \n\nSo in my mind this enough on my moms part. But my wife doesn\u2019t agree and no matter how many times I explain it she doesn\u2019t get it. \n\nYesterday I told her that my mom doesn\u2019t have to love her.

Your moms love language sounds like it resonates with showing you *how* she feels not telling you which is actually much more sincere. \n\nGiven the age gap in your relationship it\u2019s incredibly insecure of your spouse to insist that unless she hears the words *\u2019I love you\u2019* she\u2019ll never be sure where she stands with her MIL and why she needs to do desperately hear that is for her to sort out. \n\nHowever, you may want to remind her that all the other DIL\u2019s have accepted her way of showing her love for everyone and unless she starts to embrace the ebb and flow of her way of being, she\u2019s doing nothing more than creating a wedge between all of you and making herself look immature while being the elder partner in your relationship.", "NTA- your mom is allowed to be who she is. Your moms not being unkind. Your wife sounds exhausting, needy and emotionally immature probably why a 35 year old sought out a younger spouse. Tell her to grow up not everyone has to be vomit praise and emotions all over her.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m very similar to your Mom and can totally understand where she is coming from. (My husbands family overwhelms me constantly with the forced affection)\nAs long as she treats your wife with kindness and respect, that\u2019s all that should be expected. In the nicest way possible, if your wife needs more validation than that, that\u2019s her problem.", "NTA your wife needs to understand that not everyone is willing or able to show love in the way she demands it.

Consider this silent treatment a gift.", "NTAYour wife is being immature and weird. I understand that your wife wants a loving relationship with your mom, but your mom just isn't like that. Your mom has an issue with expressing herself in general, let alone with your wife. Assuming your wife knows this, she should understand and respect it.\n\nLet's say for instance, you DID try and nudge your mom to say 'I love you' to your wife (which would overall be a weird ass request IMO), and your mom did, it wouldn't be genuine now, would it? No, because it would be forced, and not meaningful at all because your mom would just be doing it for you, not because she loves your wife (and who knows, she might not love her like that anyway and that's okay)", "Considering the MiL's from hell we all hear about, you should be lucky your inlaws accept you, let alone love.", "NTA \n\nYou're mum shouldn't need to change to suit your wife's demands. By saying your wife is bubbly and craves words of affirmation makes it sound like she's completely obnoxious. Especially when she cannot understand that your mum should not need to bend her entire character/personality to cater to her.", "NTA.  But your whole shit is a mess.  Your wife's need for unreasonable affirmation from your mom coupled with the age gap is trouble. You simply do not have enough life experience to be an equal partner in this relationship. She's going to blind side you with shit you never saw coming.  I guarantee you're back here in 2 years asking us if you should go no contact with a family member because your wife is upset.

You know your mother\u2019s nature and how she expresses love and affection. She respects and seems to even like your wife in that she sends packages showing she\u2019s thought of her.
