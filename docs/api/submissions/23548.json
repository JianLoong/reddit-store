The mother also sucks here.  She does not want to deal with the fallout and leaving you guys to deal with it.  She is also assuming you guys are going to stay together hence why she entrusted you with it which I find very naive. I just hope that if you guys should break up for any reason you would be nice enough to give him the house but that is a gamble, ironically.", "NAH\n\nHer request is not fully unreasonable. But it is an unusual decision to leave your entire fortune to someone you are not related to, when you have living relatives you are close to.\n\nI see a few potential problems.\n\nFirst, is your BF's mother of sound mind at the moment?  The medicines used to manage pain in terminal disease can affect one's ability to think.  Likewise, if the cancer has spread enough to create brain tumors.  This is something that should be discussed with her doctor.  It might work as a ***legitimate*** reason for the boyfriend to contest a will made at this late date.\n\nSecond, your BF's mother seems to be assuming that you and your BF will stay together, and you will use this money to support him, while keeping him from gambling it away.  However, the two of you aren't married.  There is no reason for you not to take the money and dump the boyfriend, theoretically.  It won't protect him in the way that she may be imagining.  Putting the money into a trust, with an annuity that will pay him a portion each month, may be better for protecting him.  She should consult a financial expert about this.\n\nThird, this decision is going to drive a wedge between you and your BF.  He'll want the money.  He'll resent that she gave it to you instead of him.  And he'll then come to resent you. He may even leave you, if you take the money, and work against him if he contests the will.\n\nFourth, if you tell him, he's apt to argue with his mother about this.  It would drive a wedge between them, as sure as such an estate plan would drive a wedge between you and your BF.\n\nFifth, because the two of you have been together for so long, I suspect that, especially if you agree to this arrangement, her next step will be wanting you to get married.  (\"Please, I just want to see the two of you happy and married before I go!\")  Tying you to him, making you commit yourself to staying with him, and supporting him.  If you marry while she's living, this would be a marital asset once you get it.  So you'd either wind up supporting him as your husband, or if you divorce, he'd claim a portion in the divorce.\n\nSixth, if your BF does contest the will, and you successfully defend it, there will still be a huge legal bill.   While whomever wins can as the probate court to have the estate pay their costs, this would still eat up a significant chunk of money, and some of that money would be out of pocket expenses for you either way.  So you don't want to get stuck having to defend the will if he contests it, and if he's surprised by what's in the will, and thinks it unreasonable, he's more likely to contest it. Worst case scenario, the contesting of the will costs a lot, and the only one who gets rich off of the estate is the lawyers.\n\nAnd, most importantly:\n\nHe's 35.  He's still living with his mother.  He can't always pay his bills, and turns to you for money when he's gambled it away.  It sounds as if she's protected him financially for all of his adult life, and she's looking to tie you to him to take over this task when she's gone, using this money and her desire to see you have a home as the rope to tie you with.\n\nETA:\n\nTo OP, I'd suggest that you insist that the mother needs to tell her son about the will.  Further, if she does this, make it clear you want her to pre-probate the will, so that it has been communicated to everyone and is on record.  The process isn't available everywhere, and it isn't appropriate for everyone.  But for this situation, if things are sorted and known now, it will prevent argument later.

She knows you are competent and will look after the money and is hoping you will stay with her son so he benefits too. She'd be better putting money into trust with you as executor. It is a small difference but it does mean she doesn't disinherit him to your benefit and he is protected if you split. Talk to an estate lawyer. This current approach risks wrecking your relationship when this comes out and he'd be left with nothing except by your good will. \n\nOf course, she may be feeling ashamed of her son and want to both recompense you for putting up with him and stop him ruining her work.

I would suggest you go back to his mother and explain the position she's put you in and not accept it unless she tells her son, and he agrees.\n\nA secret like that is big especially since he doesn't know about it at all. It's not exactly something you can reveal 2 or 3 years later after his mom passes like \n\n\"Oh yeah btw your mom left me the house.\"\n\n\"What house?\"\n\n\"The one she's had in a different country for over 12 years and left it to me because she didn't trust you with it, it's in her will that she told you nothing about.\"", " NTA", "It would be better if the mother made you the owner, but the property is to be held In Trust for the both of you, due to her sons financial past. \n\nA similar situation arose with Jamie Blandford - the first son of an English peer. Jamie was known for his illegal drug use, spells in prison, etc and his father was worried that he would squander the family estate. So he left all his possessions to be held in trust. He couldn\u2019t stop his son becoming the next Duke of Marlborough.\n\nThe 12th Duke of Marlborough is still not perfect - his Porsche was subject to repossession proceedings earlier this year.", "Respect your bf\u2019s mom.

He'll eventually learn about this, at the very latest when the will is read.  ***There is absolutely no way to keep this secret from the BF forever, it is purely a matter of when and how he learns of this.***\n\nIf the mother doesn't explain her choices and reasoning to her son, he's going to believe that, at best, OP and his mother conspired to keep him from getting an inheritance he's expecting, to, at worst, him believing that OP manipulated his mother into this decision.\n\nThe mother leaving her inheritance to OP instead of her son is going to be a harsh blow to the son, no matter when he finds out.\n\nKeeping this secret until the will is read does not avoid fights and drama.  It merely lets the mother evade explaining her choice and dealing with the consequences.  At the cost of making an even bigger drama after the mother's death for the OP to deal with. \n\nThis will likely ruin the relationship between OP and the BF, leading to resentment and distrust.  Possibly reaching the point of a legal mess, if the BF contests the will.  Which is more likely to happen if his mother hasn't explained this to him while she's alive.  \n\nWhether OP tells the BF now, after the mother's death, or leaves it to be discovered by BF when mother's lawyer reads the will, this is going to be a proper mess.", "This is basically why she wants me to have the property she has been working on.

She might not fully be awake how much things costs as they add up. I know my BF isn\u2019t great at finances but he would never steal money from anyone but he still doesn\u2019t have the best financial judgment either. I keep my finances private from him.", "I guess ops mom probably just wants peace for her last week's. Maybe selfish but she absolutely has every right not wanting to spend her last weeks arguing with her son about his inheritance.

He will definitely blow through this money and you know it.", "Also, OP, if you give an addict that's trying to get sober a lot of money all of a sudden, they will relapse! Your bf will find himself with a fortune, get overwhelmed, and gamble all of it away. It's better if the money is yours, and you share it with him.
