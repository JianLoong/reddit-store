We\u2019d been planning to grab food beforehand but were running a little late, and stopped by a restaurant/bar near the venue. We parked about two blocks away, about a 5-minute walk. It was about 8:15 PM and dark out in one of the busiest downtown parts of our city.\n\nWhen we got there, my wife realized that she\u2019d forgotten her prescription glasses. Sparing the details, her eyes bother her occasionally to the point where she has trouble seeing, especially at night. It\u2019s hard for her to manage when she doesn\u2019t have her glasses, and when it\u2019s flaring up, she can only see when she closes one eye without them.\n\nWe discussed a couple of options to get them, like going to the car after we ate and cutting it a little close to see our friend before the show started, going to the venue to see our friend first then going to get her glasses, and her just running to the car while we were waiting for our food. The last one was her suggestion, and after we ordered, she asked for my keys and went to the car.\n\nShe mentioned that it was a little sketchy later that night, there was a person experiencing homelessness, and I remember thinking \u201cdammit, I should have gone to the car for her,\u201d though I don\u2019t think I said it out loud.\n\nFast forward four days, and apparently she\u2019s been stewing over this because we got into an argument this morning where she said she wished I\u2019d be more considerate, and brought up what happened the other night. I asked what she meant, and she said I should have offered to walk to the car for her.\n\nIn retrospect, I think she was dropping hints before she left the table that she didn\u2019t want to walk to the car, and I could have picked up on them. And the walk is a little sketchy, it\u2019s mostly a relatively well lit alleyway behind the main strip of bars except it\u2019s pretty dark right by where we parked and it\u2019s off of the busy part of the area. Still somewhat high level of foot/car traffic, but I acknowledge that I could/should have done better, and told her as such.\n\nI also asked if, in the future, she could just tell me what she wants/needs in these times. I was distracted, tired, and brain foggy that night, and if she\u2019d have asked I would have gone. But it didn\u2019t cross my mind in the moment.\n\nShe refuses to chalk it up to a mistake and let it go, and says she shouldn\u2019t have to ask me to do things like this for her. It should be a husband\u2019s instinct to do things like this for his wife. I don\u2019t disagree that I should have picked up on it, but if she was worried about it she just needed to say something and I definitely would have gone to the car for her (she believes me when I say that). I said that I don\u2019t do well with hints, and she\u2019s telling me that this is a signal that I don\u2019t care about her. \n\nSo AITA for being inconsiderate and letting my wife walk alone in the dark?", "created_utc": 1683684285, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ddauc/aita_for_letting_my_wife_walk_to_the_car_in_the/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes.\n\nDo people sometimes not think of something until hindsight? Yes.\n\nShould your wife have been a grown-up and used her words when it became clear that going hadn't crossed your mind in that moment? Yes.\n\nESH", "Your wife is effectively sight impaired at night without glasses.  She needed help for safety. You should have walked with her \n\nShe didn\u2019t communicate clearly. Regardless of what spouses should do for each other, she could have just asked. She should have been direct. \n\nWe all screw things up like this from time to time. Mild ESH.", "ESH, truthfully you should have gone to get it for her or finish your meal and then walk her to the car.    \n\n\nnow hinting is not communicating. hinting is what a child does when they specifically want something. adults uses words and tell you what they want to do. you both have a lack of communication that needs to be worked on. we aren't built to read minds so better get that fix before it becomes worst.", "NAH\n\nAs someone who on occasion does exactly what your wife did (It was even the same glasses situation, I'm not even joking), it's not fair on you. At the same time, its not wrong for her to want to feel protected and cared for.\n\nMini essay incoming!\n\nFrom my own experience: Would it be nice for my husband to think of it and just want to do things like that? Yes, and most of the time he does. But he has off nights. He is tired sometimes. AND I could be better at saying what I need. Part of the fault is on me because I don't want to be needy, but that's silly, ***he would never view it that way***. He would rather I just outright say what I need so he can care for me in the way that is meaningful.\n\nMy husband is a very caring man, and same as you, would 100% have gone if I asked him. But his brain works very differently to mine and he REALLY struggles to pick up on my cues. Hence sometimes he is spot on in anticipating needs because he is really concentrating, but sometimes when he is tired, he just misses things. It's perfectly human. This kind of thing should be give and take and we need to understand our partners and the way they think/communicate and take that into account when we are asking for things. What is a giant neon DO THIS in one persons brain is a tiny little footnote in another persons brain. We need to adapt and try to communicate with each other in a way that resonates with each party. To be clear, this should be a two-way thing, not a one way thing. Both partners should adapt to ensure miscommunication doesn't happen.\n\nExample of both adapting:\n\nYou should know that your wife uses little hints and just wants to feel protected, therefore, you should just offer to get the glasses (as you already identified).\n\nYour wife should know you struggle with hints and that you need something more explicit; therefore she should be more forthcoming with her expectations and just state it (I really struggle to do this, personally I feel incredibly demanding. Your wife may not feel that way, but if she does, you have no idea how hard it is to just ask for something. Might be something to keep in mind.)\n\n\\*Edit to fix spelling mistakes.", "NTA. She's a grown woman, and if she wanted you to go for or with her, she should have said so. Instead, *she* suggested going herself to grab them and then went with that idea.", "ESH\n\nShe should have used her big girl words and said what she wanted!

That being said, I can somewhat understand her being upset but, 1. She should've asked in the moment 2. She could've expressed sooner that it upset her instead of stewing in something that could've been avoided had she spoken to you.", "Soft YTA because you should have accompanied your wife or offered to go for her to get the glasses\u2014 however, NTA for not being able to read your wife\u2019s mind.  It is not fair for her to say she shouldn\u2019t have to ask you to do these things and that you should just know\u2014 this is an unreasonable expectation and your wife needs to learn how to express her feelings and needs clearly and directly and that is 100% her responsibility- not yours.", "YTA.
