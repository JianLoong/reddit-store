We\u2019d been planning to grab food beforehand but were running a little late, and stopped by a restaurant/bar near the venue. We parked about two blocks away, about a 5-minute walk. It was about 8:15 PM and dark out in one of the busiest downtown parts of our city.\n\nWhen we got there, my wife realized that she\u2019d forgotten her prescription glasses. Sparing the details, her eyes bother her occasionally to the point where she has trouble seeing, especially at night. It\u2019s hard for her to manage when she doesn\u2019t have her glasses, and when it\u2019s flaring up, she can only see when she closes one eye without them.\n\nWe discussed a couple of options to get them, like going to the car after we ate and cutting it a little close to see our friend before the show started, going to the venue to see our friend first then going to get her glasses, and her just running to the car while we were waiting for our food. The last one was her suggestion, and after we ordered, she asked for my keys and went to the car.\n\nShe mentioned that it was a little sketchy later that night, there was a person experiencing homelessness, and I remember thinking \u201cdammit, I should have gone to the car for her,\u201d though I don\u2019t think I said it out loud.\n\nFast forward four days, and apparently she\u2019s been stewing over this because we got into an argument this morning where she said she wished I\u2019d be more considerate, and brought up what happened the other night. I asked what she meant, and she said I should have offered to walk to the car for her.\n\nIn retrospect, I think she was dropping hints before she left the table that she didn\u2019t want to walk to the car, and I could have picked up on them. And the walk is a little sketchy, it\u2019s mostly a relatively well lit alleyway behind the main strip of bars except it\u2019s pretty dark right by where we parked and it\u2019s off of the busy part of the area. Still somewhat high level of foot/car traffic, but I acknowledge that I could/should have done better, and told her as such.\n\nI also asked if, in the future, she could just tell me what she wants/needs in these times. I was distracted, tired, and brain foggy that night, and if she\u2019d have asked I would have gone. But it didn\u2019t cross my mind in the moment.\n\nShe refuses to chalk it up to a mistake and let it go, and says she shouldn\u2019t have to ask me to do things like this for her. It should be a husband\u2019s instinct to do things like this for his wife. I don\u2019t disagree that I should have picked up on it, but if she was worried about it she just needed to say something and I definitely would have gone to the car for her (she believes me when I say that). I said that I don\u2019t do well with hints, and she\u2019s telling me that this is a signal that I don\u2019t care about her. \n\nSo AITA for being inconsiderate and letting my wife walk alone in the dark?", "created_utc": 1683684285, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ddauc/aita_for_letting_my_wife_walk_to_the_car_in_the/", "score": 627, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes.\n\nESH", "Your wife is effectively sight impaired at night without glasses.  She needed help for safety. You should have walked with her \n\nShe didn\u2019t communicate clearly.

At the same time, its not wrong for her to want to feel protected and cared for.\n\nMini essay incoming!\n\nFrom my own experience: Would it be nice for my husband to think of it and just want to do things like that? Yes, and most of the time he does. But he has off nights. He is tired sometimes. AND I could be better at saying what I need. Part of the fault is on me because I don't want to be needy, but that's silly, ***he would never view it that way***. He would rather I just outright say what I need so he can care for me in the way that is meaningful.\n\nMy husband is a very caring man, and same as you, would 100% have gone if I asked him. But his brain works very differently to mine and he REALLY struggles to pick up on my cues. Hence sometimes he is spot on in anticipating needs because he is really concentrating, but sometimes when he is tired, he just misses things. It's perfectly human. This kind of thing should be give and take and we need to understand our partners and the way they think/communicate and take that into account when we are asking for things. What is a giant neon DO THIS in one persons brain is a tiny little footnote in another persons brain. We need to adapt and try to communicate with each other in a way that resonates with each party. To be clear, this should be a two-way thing, not a one way thing. Both partners should adapt to ensure miscommunication doesn't happen.\n\nExample of both adapting:\n\nYou should know that your wife uses little hints and just wants to feel protected, therefore, you should just offer to get the glasses (as you already identified).\n\nYour wife should know you struggle with hints and that you need something more explicit; therefore she should be more forthcoming with her expectations and just state it (I really struggle to do this, personally I feel incredibly demanding. Your wife may not feel that way, but if she does, you have no idea how hard it is to just ask for something. Might be something to keep in mind.)\n\n\\*Edit to fix spelling mistakes.", "NTA.

Make sure you yell fire instead of help if something does happen, because people are more likely to help and so on and so on...\n\nIt's not something you need to worry about, so I get the lapse.\n\nBut also, your wife is an adult. She should know by now that hints and expecting your husband/partner to read your mind and know implicitly what you want is a great way to introduce constant disappointment and build resentment in a relationship.

Full grown adults are in dynamics and in relationships. Whether she is in one where she can communicate without dropping hints is questionable. What isn't questionable is that he knew she was visually impaired, that it was night time where that impairment gets worse, and he was ok with her going out to fetch the glasses.

I need to pick up a few things too\" is totally ok.", "The wife stewing for 4 days and saying he doesn't care about her makes her an AH", "But OPs own words says how their partner can practically go blind in one eye... combine that with the not so alluring description they gave of the walk you would imagine OP wouldn't think twice about going back to the car with them.", "I understand that but I do think OP should have been more than willingly to either go with her or get them for her. \n\nI think what OPs partner is trying to get at is OP should have never expected her to go by herself. Which I agree with, literally OPs own words she practically can go blind in one eye. \n\nSure we could talk about how partner should be more direct or how bad it was forgetting the glasses but ultimately that happened, and OP handled it poorly.", " I think people saying partner communicated poorly are really missing the point.\r  \n\r  \nImagine if OP walked into a building and let the door slam in partners face instead of just holding it, that wouldn't be very nice would it?\r  \n\r  \nIt's like that, it's so painfully obvious OP should have gone for partner or at least gone with them... of course they are the asshole.", "Attacked . Auto correct", "Wife also should have been a grown up and remembered her glasses... Why weren't they already on her face?\n\nNTA.", "That isn't even close to a decent comparison.", "I think people saying partner communicated poorly are really missing the point. \n\nImagine if OP walked into a building and let the door slam in partners face instead of just holding it, that wouldn't be very nice would it? \n\nIt's like that, it's so painfully obvious OP should have gone for partner or at least gone with them... of course they are the asshole.", "OP\u2019s wife has trouble seeing at night. This makes it a riskier journey for her than him, that has nothing to do with being a woman.", "That isn't what weaponized incompetence is. It would be him somehow doing a terrible job of escorting her to the car.", "That's fair but that doesn't always protect you from not being the asshole.", "Well, it might not be his responsibility but it would be the right thing to do. She\u2019s his wife, not some random woman.", "Why isn't it? OP admits in their own post their partner can effectively go blind. And they explain how.. unpleasant the walk was. \n\nFrom how it was described I wouldn't let anyone walk alone even if they had perfect vision.", "Women are far more likely to be sexually assaulted and you damn well know that.", "I think you are being a little bit too narrow with your definition, because he is doing a terrible job accommodating his partners disability, doing a terrible job being a thoughtful partner and doing a terrible job as a date. \n\nLike what kind of person let\u2019s a single lady they are accompanying walk alone for blocks at night in downtown? Now add in a disability where her night vision is compromised. Seems pretty inexcusable to chalk that up to a lapse in judgment", "It is weird that it escaped the mind of the person that actually needed it", "You're entitled to that opinion of him then. Personally, I don't think he's one in the instance he described."]}
