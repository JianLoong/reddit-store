I pay for all of my food by myself and I do not eat any of my other roommates\u2019 food. Multiple times now I\u2019ve caught two of them in particular taking and eating my food without asking. I\u2019ve asked them to stop and I\u2019m usually met with \u201csorry, it was in the fridge so why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to have it?\u201d Or something along those lines. To be clear, I always label my initials on my food in the fridge. Yet they\u2019re constantly still eating my food. No it is not a financial issue, they\u2019ve bought their own food yet continue to eat mine and not apologize. \n\nI had enough so I put two mini-fridges in my room. One from my parents house and one I just purchased. I\u2019ve started compacting my food down and fitting it between the two fridges and lock my door when I\u2019m not around. My roommates, even the ones not eating my food are very upset at me. They say it isn\u2019t fair for me to \u201cgatekeep\u201d my food from everyone else. I explained that I have sensory sensitivity, which they already know, and I like to have my food for myself. They said I was being extremely selfish and one of them even said \u201cif you\u2019re going to live with other people, you are expected to share your food with them.\u201d\n\nI think this is absolutely ridiculous but now I\u2019ve been outcast from the rest of the roommates. They\u2019re all very angry with me and even refuse to talk to me now. I\u2019ve clearly upset them but I feel very strongly about this. I genuinely don\u2019t know what to do about this. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I have not tried stealing their food and I won\u2019t start because that\u2019s just hypocritical to me. Thanks for all the advice. For anyone concerned about price increase in the electricity bill, I was already paying more than everyone else in utilities to begin with. They never provide the correct amount of money toward utilities and then say they didn\u2019t know or can\u2019t afford but will do it next time. This has been going on since the beginning. For everyone suggesting I cook for them weekly and have them pay for the groceries, I can see myself getting burnt out very easily and I don\u2019t see them being willing to pay for the groceries and will probably say something like \u201cyou should be willing to make it for us for free.\u201d \n\nThank you all so much for all of your advice and tips. You guys have been great in reassuring me. \n\nEdit 2: I read your suggestions on moving out. The issue is that off campus housing that\u2019s reasonably close to campus is extremely competitive and (at least where I am) students have to start looking around a year in advance and all other apartments are currently taken.

They will believe that you owe them \u00a3\u00a3 because they are having to spend on food.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nWidowed with 2 adult kids. While we raised our kids we obviously had a 'communal' fridge. Pretty much everything was up for grabs. Then occasionally, every once in a while a special treat would show up for someone. That treat was off limits to everyone else in the home. \n\nSo your roommates saying that sharing a home means sharing everything in the fridge? No....no it doesn't work like that unless you've agreed to it. \n\nIf my husband bought me my most favorite expensive chocolates, my girls never laid a finger on them without permission. If I made my youngest daughter her favorite dinner. It was understood that the leftovers were hers for her lunch and possibly dinner the next day. No one touched it. If I helped my oldest daughter with a complex recipe, we all got a sample and if it turned out well the rest disappeared with her to classes the next day to share with friends. If my husband had a good day fishing, well again all his.", "NTA at all and I think it\u2019s weird they\u2019re mad about it.", "NTA, my roommate in college and I had separate fridges and never ate each other\u2019s food. That was a given and common sense.", ">\u201cif you\u2019re going to live with other people, you are expected to share your food with them.\u201d\n\nUh, no. That's not a thing. That's just trying to con you into giving your food away. \n\nEverytime they trot this stupidity out, just say, \"If you're going to live with other people, you are expected to respect them and their belongings -- including food.\"  Because that IS a thing.\n\nI'm *married* and it's not unusual that my partner or I will buy something that we want to have for our lunches or whatever, and we just say, \"Please leave this for me\". And the other does just that!\n\nNTA, but you live with some AHs.", "NTA.  They are stealing.  It's not their parents house and you are not their mommy.", "NTA. I also have a roommate who goes to my college, and we never touch each other's food unless offered. We even have two separate bottles of dish soap because it's easier than keeping track of household expenses and dividing them up. Hold firm, because sharing items between roommates is not expected unless agreed upon in advance, in which case you'd be splitting the costs. They are trying to see how much they can get away with.", "So you're expected to share your food, but they don't have to share theirs? What bullshit is that.\n\nIt's your food, not communal food. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are not obligated to share food you paid for with shitty mooching roommates. Not unless they contributed to the cost, and it sounds like they didn't. I can't believe they said you're \"gatekeeping\" your food. That statement makes me laugh so much! It's your food. You bought it. They have no right to any of it. It shows how stupid and entitled some people are. \n\nI wonder, have any of these people ever had roommates before? Is this their first time living away from home? They may be making assumptions about food that come from living with their parents. At their parents' house, all the food is for everybody. Now that they're in college they have to buy their own food. I know you're not going to, but if you did take some of their food I bet they would have a major fit about it.\n\nIf these are not friends you chose to live with, put in paperwork to get a different apartment. I know you said it would take a while but you might as well get the ball rolling. Other people are not going to be expecting to eat your food for free. You need to get out of there. Also, if you haven't done it already, get locks for your refrigerators. I don't know if you're allowed to put a lock on your bedroom door, but if you can, lock that too. Double protection.\n\nYou don't owe these girls anything and you know they are in the wrong. Don't give in to pressure or bullying. Get out of that apartment as soon as you can.\n\nBest of luck!", "Have you tried looking for new roommates and and moving in with them. It's not right that they are taking your food. I lived with roommates before and we all share it. We all shared our food but if somebody had something special they put their name on it and no one touched it you have a different problem. I know apartments are expensive so what you might try and do is find another place with my other roommates. Or you might want to talk to your roommates and try and straighten it out but it doesn't seem like they want to have that. It sounds like they're the ones that are selfish and then making a big deal out of you wanting your own food and then taking it without asking. Well think about trying to find some new roommate.", "NTA - they may have an issue with shared electricity bills if you are running 2 extra  fridges?\n\nBut sounds like these assholes didn't like you taking assertive action to regain control.  I've been in a situation like this, I know how you are feeling, it is not you it is them, you've just been unlucky with roommates.\n\nOther options:\n\n* Source your food only when you need, so you have almost nothing in the fridge. \n* buy some stuff that is almost out of date and leave it in the fridge for them (decoy)\n* Buy food that does not need to be refrigerated (so you can quietly keep it in your room).\n* Get into some weird and quirky food they won't want", "Can you stop buying food?

I even paid over half the security deposit even though the initial plan was to split it equally.", "I've had different roommates over the years and different situations in college vs. living with young women who all had decent jobs.\n\nCollege roommates - money was tight and after the first food squabbles, most boundaries were respected.\n\nWhen I lived with the latter, we all took the initiative, i.e. if someone saw the milk or OJ was low, that person bought more and that was that. We all contributed. Not one felt she was buying more stuff than the other. Sometimes we cooked and had a meal together. It all worked out.", "Oregon food.", "Well, that's one solution that made me laugh to", "Nah.  Only store raw liver and beef tongue.  They won\u2019t ask for you to share again.", "I would get a mini freezer too. Great for meal prepping. I have one from Iceco that\u2019s like a chest freezer and can even be plugged into a car if you want to take it around for groceries.", "*static* \"We have a report of sporadic food theft in student housing, Liberty Street 165. All units report.\"\n\nNot thinking they should touch OPs food, but making the threat of reporting for theft?\n\nWho would ever take this report seriously?

What a nice person she was!", "Even then there are certan things you get just for you. I love star crunch bars. There hard to find.

I had a group of 5 that I did buy most of the groceries for and was pretty ok with them taking stuff.

OOP got some AH roommates.", "Are you all on the lease? Or just you? Do you have a record of the money owed?\n\nThey are taking advantage of you. You\u2019re paying more in utilities.
