He told me it was too hard to get food stamps and I was like, things are hard sometimes! But you have to do it to be able to live a quality life! I was like I will help you, it takes 30 minutes and he said no. \n\n\nI buy food to take to work. He has ate this food before so I told him not to and I started putting my name on my food. Then I had two drinks in the fridge that he drank both of and his excuse was that my name wasn\u2019t on them and he didn\u2019t have time before work to grab a drink. \n\nI told him you need to buy your own food. Then not even a week later he drinks my soda. It\u2019s not about the soda or the food, it\u2019s the principal. I ask you not to please don\u2019t do it especially when it doesn\u2019t belong to you. I might be an ahole for kicking him out but I don\u2019t deal with rude people.\n\nI work hard and he\u2019s acting like a fucking entitled ahole. And he said he \u201capologized\u201d but it was more of I\u2019m sorry you feel that way I got caught not a real I\u2019m sorry. \nHe told me I needed to be more responsible, and I was like really? I\u2019m 31. I work 50+ hours a week I have a house a car I take care of my daughter and animals I still make time to maintain my living quarters cook dinner and contribute to other ways in the house.\n\n\nAnd I take care of people for a living? (Also my husband pays him $50 every 2 weeks to do his chores like he\u2019s a child) \n\n\nHe pays $350 month and he still complains about it being too much, never pays on time. I only charged him that when he moved in cause he was down and out and living in his car and I was like, extra room what can you pay till you get steady work? he was my friend and I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d take advantage of me like this. He doesn\u2019t have any responsibilities, he still wants to live this stupid hippie lifestyle at 42.\n\n\nI said You\u2019re more than 10 years older than me and you can\u2019t keep a job cause you just wanna fuck around and stop showing up. You haven\u2019t had a car for a year and a half even though your mom said she\u2019d buy you one and you complain when I won\u2019t let you borrow mine? He even mooches off of our neighbor for booze and food weed and rides.\n\n\nI\u2019ve given him a million chances. He\u2019s fucked us over and used us. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being an ahole but what do you think? \n\n\nI didn\u2019t kick him out for the food is was the disrespect that got to me and seeing him sit there like \u201cI did nothing wrong\u201dhe wasn\u2019t going to change. \n\nI don\u2019t have anything against people who have a hard time finding jobs. that\u2019s not the case, he\u2019s lazy and irresponsible. he quit his job so he could go to Cali for a month and was like I\u2019ll have my mom pay rent this month and she wouldn\u2019t and I had to let him use my car to door dash to make up rent and he got mad at me when I needed to use MY car.", "created_utc": 1678019553, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11iw2di/aita_for_kicking_my_roommate_out/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
