Seems like a boundary was set and then your room-mate crossed it.  It you let it go, it will happen again.", "NTA. The fact that you explicitly asked your flatmate to keep people out of your room, he heard and agreed, and then *lied* about it to your face as a first response, yeah that's all pretty fucked up. If you hadn't established that boundary and he was just like \"Eh my flatmate is out just take his bed\" and changed the sheets in the morning/told you about it it'd be a different story, but this is just disrespect for your boundaries, space, and privacy.\n\nAlso, gonna go out on a limb here, but does your *flatmate* have a bed too? Why couldn't he give the guy *his* bed, and if they weren't at a \"share a bed\" point in their relationship, *he* can sleep on the couch when he's ready to go to bed.\n\nAs to \"should I be mad\" I mean, you have a right to be, but imo what you *should* do is... ~~install a deadbolt on your bedroom door and have the only key to it. Then you don't have to worry about your flatmate, who clearly can't just respect your boundaries on his own, deciding to go into your room. He won't be able to. If you don't have the carpentry skills to install a deadbolt (or are just worried about the security deposit) a padlock hasp is the next best thing. A little less secure, sure, but much easier to remove and cover up with some putty on move-out.~~\n\n~~Even with the padlock one would think (or at least *hope*) that your flatmate wouldn't go so far as to buy some shims or bolt-cutters to break into your room when you're not home and would just not bother because it's locked.~~\n\n...replace your door knob with one that locks with a key and keep the only key. As the person below pointed out this is a much better option than a deadbolt or padlock hasp if you're renting.\n\nNot recommending this *specific* item as I don't know the brand at all but for an idea of what to look for in your local hardware store, [something like this](https://www.amazon.com/HENYIN-Hardware-Handle-Lockset-805SN-R/dp/B071L2DX2M/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=lever%2BKnob%2Bwith%2Bkey&qid=1684960416&s=hardware&sr=1-3&th=1). Just make sure if you go with a lever rather than a round knob (they're better for fire safety because you don't have to grasp them to turn them) you buy the correct orientation for the direction your door swings or the keyhole will be on the wrong side of the door.", "NTA. You have every right to be mad. He says \u201cduh who\u2019d do that\u201d and did it anyway, THEN lied. He\u2019ll do what he wants and lie about it. He\u2019s an AH.", "Yes, be mad.\n\nFirst clothes on the floor, he needed the chair and just tossed clothes on the floor. \n\nThen he let someone sleep in your room, on your bed without telling you and tried to cover it up.\n\nDid he change your sheets? Why couldn\u2019t person crash on the floor in his room? \n\nHe had a party and needed to treat your room as if it wasn\u2019t even there. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou should be mad. And you need a lock on your door and/or to contact the landlord and report him. Otherwise this will continue.", "NTA.  He violated your request to keep people out of your room.  Worse, the idea of a stranger sleeping in your bed seems gross.  Did he at least offer to launder the sheets?", "NTA I\u2019d be mad too. You don\u2019t want some rando sleeping in your bed. You need to tell your roommate he will need to wash all of your bedding. And get a lock for your door since RM clearly can\u2019t be trusted.", "NTA and I would get a locking door handle for your room.", "NTA and clearly your flatmate isn't trustworthy", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, he cross boundaries and lied to you about it. You have every right to be upset, no matter the reason.", "NTA- he invaded your privacy by having a stranger sleep in your bed. I'd be putting a lock on my door so this doesnt happen again.", "NTA \n\nYou clearly said not to let anyone in your room but he still did . He didn't respect your boundaries. You've every right to be mad.", "NTA. You set a boundary. He crossed it, and then hid it from you. Why would you trust him again in the future?", "NTA. It's a complete invasion.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYou have boundaries that were violated. If you want to be gracious about it explain that it better never happen again. Otherwise time to move. That's a pretty easy line to not cross.", "NTA:  You don't know her, and that is your stuff.", "NTA he lied and invaded your space", ">Should I be mad?\n\nYes.", "NTA. I would be pissed too.", "NTA. Yes, be mad. He did something you specifically told him not, used your belongings, then lied to you about it. He does not respect your boundaries.", "NTA, that\u2019s a completely appropriate response to having someone ignore your very simple request", "Nta.\n\nI'd be furious.\n\nSure, I have let friends sleep in my bed previously when they have needed too due to being on a night shift after staying at mine, but the bed gets completely stripped. I am really funny about that sort of stuff to. I won't even used a blanket that's been around anyone aside from me or my partner. It makes my skin crawl.\n\nYou told him to too and he agreed and then Brome said agreement. If possible, get a lock for your door. Might cause a problem or 2 with him but he broke your trust.", "NTA \n\nYou flatmate certainly stomped the heck out of the boundary he agreed to which was no one in your room.  \n\nSo while it didn\u2019t happen, what was your flatmate\u2019s plan if some of your possessions turned up missing?  Things like makeup kits, jewelry or whatever? \n\nSo as other posters suggested get an exterior grade door knob which will come with two keys.  You should be easily able to pull out the existing doorknob by removing usually two screws and then installing the new knob.  Keep the original for when you move out to take your knob with you. \n\nEither keep both keys with you or see if your lease requires you to provide a key to any locks you add. \n\nTake pictures of the current knob so you know which way the actual latch portion that fits into the hole in the door knob should face.\n\nIf you flatmate gets pissy about it just tell him you don\u2019t feel it\u2019s fair of you to put him in the position of keeping people out of your room when you aren\u2019t there. \n\nAlso lock your door anytime you leave.  It is a good habit to get into to insure your private area of the flat is just that.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s trickle-truthing. Someones totally had a 3some on the bed", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet a lock and a motion activated security camera.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Understandable you\u2019d be upset and I do agree with others that if this is a pattern at all you should get a lock for your door.

If your roommates story has any truth to it though, that is a tough situation and ultimately he chose to prioritize protecting a girl over your boundaries. You mentionned he has a sizable bed but again, giving the girl somewhere to sleep alone might have been the best thing for her to feel safe. It\u2019s not a situation that you should have been put in, but sometimes these things happen.
