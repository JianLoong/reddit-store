{"id": 16206, "submission_id": "135gpkx", "title": "AITA for telling a girl to grow up after she cried about girls at a party?", "selftext": "My (24f) fianc\u00e9 has a company, which has 11 employees. When they've had a particularly successful quarter, my fianc\u00e9 will close up the office for a week-10 days and take everyone on an all expenses paid trip to celebrate. Partners are invited on the trip, but normally there only ends up being maybe 3 or 4 girls, including me, on the trip. This quarter, my fianc\u00e9 organised a trip to a city known for its partying. Scott, one of the guys who works at the company, mentioned he was bringing his new girlfriend, Emily, whom I'd never met.\n\nThose of us going on the trip all travelled together, which is when we met Emily. She seemed like a sweet girl, though I did notice she acted very young, and she seemed quite shy and self conscious. I felt bad for her because it's a loud group, so I tried to make an extra effort with her, but that quickly became exhausting, because for the first 5 days of the trip she seemed to be sulking about literally everything. Scott kept saying she's just not used to this kind of life but I kept thinking she may just not enjoy it.\n\nOn these trips, I organise anything that needs advanced notice. One of the things I organised was a boat party. Because we'd all been with each other for 6 days at that point, I invited a friend I know from that city, and some of her friends, to the party. Yes, they're attractive, yes, that's partly why I invited that particular group.\n\nSo, the party starts, as does Emily's running commentary. She doesn't want to wear a bikini in front of those girls, why are they all over the guys, she's hungry, on and on. We tried to make her more comfortable but every few minutes she'd be coming back with another issue.\n\nAt some point in the evening some of the girls and some of the guys including Scott, were taking shots with some of the girls. Emily came over to where I was sitting, in tears, saying how she felt insecure and like Scott was disrespecting her and she wanted to go back to the hotel. At this point, I was fed up of playing den mother. I said something to the effect of, 'Emily, you need to grow up. I'm sorry you're not having a good time and that pretty women exist, but this isn't daycare, you need to stop making it everyone else's problem'. She ended up crying to Scott about it and they left early. For the next two days she refused to leave Scott's side, and pretty much didn't talk to anyone else. The other 3 wives/girlfriends said I did the right thing because Emily was a buzzkill and needed to get over herself. My fianc\u00e9 said while he doesn't blame me for saying something, I maybe should have said something a bit less harsh because it obviously intimidated her and Scott was embarrassed. I feel bad that I made Scott feel that way, I didn't intend to cause friction, but at the same time, I was the one who had to deal with Emily's moaning, not them.

And not even your company?  And you bring extra girls to the party for the men in the group?  On a work trip? That's really weird.  And the boss wants to bro out and not be the boss but he sure will be the boss when someone claims sexual harassment or worse. Emily should find a new job away from this bro culture.", "YTA. You took it upon yourself to treat her the way you did. Then you got upset that she hadn't magically become super best friends with what sounds like an obnoxious crowd after a couple of days. \n\nYou decided the best course of action was to insinuate that she wasn't attractive and she needed to grow up, because of course anyone not enjoying the same things as you must have something wrong with them.\n\nI'm truly shocked that someone you barely know reacted poorly to your words. Perhaps reflecting your own advice to her may help.", "Info: you said Emily complained that the girls were all over the guys. Were they? Was another girl all over Scott?", "ESH\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is the host & it appears you are the planner. It is both of your jobs to ensure that your invited guests are enjoying themselves. Emily sounds immature & clearly was uncomfortable with this group. \n\nNext quarter hire a planner to deal with guest issues & don\u2019t spend every day together as a group.", "ESH. She clearly has some social anxiety and insecurities that she needs to work on and I can understand that it is difficult to accommodate someone that looks like they'd rather be anywhere else. She's the AH for not trying to at least enjoy herself a little bit. But you are the AH for how you handled it. You invited a group of hot women specifically for the fact that they looked good, so I assume it was so some of the men in your fianc\u00e9's business could have company. Fair enough. And perfect that you and the other women are secure and open enough in your relationships to have no issues. But her relationship is a new one. You mentioned she's his new girlfriend. They haven't had time to build trust and if she's already insecure then that's already a recipe for disaster. I'm not saying you shouldn't have invited those women because of her. It is her own job to deal with her insecurities. But telling her to \"grow up\" and this \"isn't kindergarten\" is unnecessarily rude. You went right for the kill and knew exactly what you were doing. Telling someone they act as a child, especially a woman, is a sure hit to their self esteem.", "Sorry, 100% YTA. The time to level with Emily was NOT immediately after her own partner arguably (it's arguable but everyone knows a lot of women would be upset) disrespected her relationship by interacting with highly attractive women. I cannot believe you chose the middle of **that** kind of crisis to socially exclude her.\n\nAnd you did socially exclude her with your comment. What choice did you really give her? She was not having a good time, this was not her scene, and you told her to grow up at literally the most challenging portion of it. I can't understand what you actually wanted her to do differently but leave the group. \"Grow up\"? That's not a helpful suggestion.\n\n\\[Edit:\\] Even absent the rest of the context, it was also wildly inappropriate for you to respond to an instance of very socially acceptable jealousy by telling her to grow up. That was very invalidating to her relationship, especially since the only reason she was there in the first place was because she was in a relationship with a main guest.", "ESH - your reaction was out of line and not proportionate. Maybe she was a buzzkill but it sounds like she came to you as a friend and you were extremely harsh. \n\nIf you had issues with her behavior you needed to address them when they happened, not blow up on her.", "ESH\u2014 yes, it\u2019s annoying she was complaining so much on a free trip and made her insecurities your problem. \nI feel like she really didn\u2019t understand your role and thought you were her friend, this nice lady who listens to her problems, when you were really basically doing your job. It\u2019s on her, too, that she didn\u2019t seem to understand you were the organizer tending to the troublesome charge. She acted like you were two kids at summer camp who became friends, complaining together about thing organized by some distant grown up camp director. \nSo it makes sense that she didn\u2019t understand the role of the boat party girls, either. \n\nSo it was a learning opportunity for you to understand that there will be some sad souls who mistake professional friendliness for being their friends\u2014 this time it was sad girl telling you her insecurities, but next time it could be sad guy who thinks you are romantically interested. Create a little polished friendly distance, like tour guides and such. I know it\u2019s not easy\u2014 you\u2019re obviously a very socially adapt person so the idea of people clinging to anyone who so much as smiles like they are life preserver is alien to you, but they aren\u2019t rare.", "Soft ESH\n\nI can see both sides here OP and it's hard to only take one side. \n\nYour side of things is that Emily was basically complaining about everything that she could have and was bringing the mood down. Honestly yeah I can see that as frustrating because you put everything together with your friends / coworkers in order to have a fun time. Someone coming along for free and complaining about every little thing is pretty frustrating considering you also tried to get them involved / tried to engage with them so that way the could enjoy themselves. I would be pretty annoyed at this too.\n\nOn the other hand, you barely know anything about this girl. I won't excuse her for constantly complaining about things, but at the same time when she came to you with a genuine concern regarding the relationship with her partner and her insecurities you immediately shut her down and basically told her that you're not interested in her problems. I get it, you're there to have fun, but at the same time maybe talking to her for a little while and trying to understand her perspective may have gone a long way. You aren't wrong for telling her to grow up, I'm saying that the execution may have been better.", "**ESH**.\n\nEmily sucks because she complained about everything on a free trip - and even used you as a 'venting machine' when she had just met you and barely knew you.\n\nScott sucks because he brought his insecure girlfriend to a boat party with attractive women and then proceeded to drink with them. Which, based on the \"boat party setting\", I'm assuming that he seemed overly 'happy' and 'cheerful' to be in their presence; imagine how that would look to an insecure person.\n\nYou suck because you, in your efforts to make her feel included, led her to assume that you were someone who she could vent to and then exploded on her. You could have said something less harsh.\n\nYour boyfriend is cool though. He sounds like a cool boss as well.", "ESH\n\n\"I don't approve of Scott having a quiet partner so I'm inviting options to the party and gonna make Emily feel worse!\"\n\nAnd it's an Everyone Sucks because your fiance and Scott went along with it! You all suck and deserve each other.", "NTA the real AH is Scott in all of this. It was his job to Look after his gf", "NTA. Can\u2019t believe someone could complain so much about a free trip very ungrateful.", "How old did Emily have to be for a 24 year old to comment on how young she was acting? And OP invited these \"hot women\" for the sake of the guys on the trip? \nYTA", "ESH", "NTA. I can understand Emily being shy and insecure, I'm the same, but I would never make a scene out of it and constantly complain about everything. If Emily can't trust Scott, she shouldn't be with him. If his behavior hurts her, she should talk to him about it, not make it everyone else's problem. What you said was harsh, but you didn't say it to be mean; you just got fed up with her ongoing behavior. You should still apologize to her.\r  \n\r  \nDid Scott do anything? Because it seems like she's just insecure about him interacting with other girls, and that's not disrespectful.", "NTA. While I do think what you said sucked to hear, I don't think it was that harsh. Why did she even come in the trip? If I was on a free vacation, I sure as hell would find a way to enjoy myself.", "NTA", "Torn, because I feel your fianc\u00e9 as the \"boss\" should've said something to employee Scott about making sure _his_ guest behaves appropriately.\n\nHowever, seeing as Scott didn't perform his responsibility, and your fianc\u00e9 didn't do hers, I feel like you did the right thing.\n\nGoing with NTA, despite the fact you could've shown a bit more tact. You could've told Scott \"Hey man, I have the feeling your GF is a bit uncomfortable you doing shots with the babes. Shouldn't you check on her?\".\n\nRegardless, the GF was a guest on an all expenses-paid trip and shouldn't be sulking. Even worse, it was a trip with her boyfriends coworkers and boss. Her sulking could've brought Scott in trouble with his boss had he been with a less forgiving boss.\n\nI _am_ curious though; what kind of company is this? Closing up shop for 2 weeks to go on a full-blown party trip with the entire company _every quarter_, dang!", "NTA women like that are exhausting", "NTA\n\nI just can't have sympathy who manages to have a bad time on something that is exactly what you expect it to be. A party weekend.", "NTA. She needs to grow up, you're correct.", "NTA...maybe this wasn't the trip for her, but that doesn't mean she can't be self aware enough to keep quiet or duck out early.

This reminds me of the downfall of [Zenefits](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/zenefits-fires-nearly-half-its-staff), which later was sold off. The workplace isn\u2019t a frat. Personally, I\u2019d love for a potential plaintiff on one of these party hard environments to walk into my doors to figure out it they have an actionable claim. \ud83e\udd11", ">[A]s a business owner & a woman I\u2019m a little bit appalled with the reason OP\u2019s \u2018friend group\u2019 were asked to join this group for a boat party.

You mention that it\u2019s not as strict as the US/UK but also has drinking restrictions of >21 years old? I thought that the US was the outlier on drinking age.", "You\u2019re 18... should be enjoying yourself! \n\nWord of caution \u2014 if you\u2019re ever in an uncomfortable situation with you co-workers or with anyone.
