We have two kids together f5, and f3, and my currently pregnant with our third. He also has a daughter from a previous relationship who is 17 years old. Since being with my husband she at first never liked me and made it known she doesn't like me. I admit at first I was pushy because I wanted her to like me and I wanted to be considered a friend but I have a sense apologized and instead show her my love by doing favors for her. Since then we have had an okay relationship and I was happy with that because I wanted to take it at her pace. That being said me and my husband were talking about how we were gonna manage him going to her graduation. \n\nShe is graduating on June 20th but my due date is on June 19th. The plan is if I gave birth on time he would go to the graduation and then come back but if I didn't then he would spend the whole day with her. We told her our plan and told her regardless her father would be at her graduation but there's a chance he may have to leave after. This got her super upset and she started yelling that she could never have her dad for herself and she deserves to have the dad for the whole day. She then told me she was tired of me having kids left and right and I was stealing her dad away. She ended her argument by saying she hated me and that she wishes the baby would d*e. After what she said I haven't been doing anything for her. Whenever she asks for anything I say ask her mom or dad. Whenever she needs money I say the same thing. I can't get over the fact she wished d*ath on my child. I've been getting texts from her mom saying she didn't mean it and that she's a kid and she shouldn't be held responsible for something said out of anger but I believe she's old enough to know what she's doing and saying.", "created_utc": 1685114253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sfyyy/aita_for_no_longer_doing_anything_for_my/", "score": 267, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is old enough to think before she speaks. If she feels that she not spending enough time with her dad then she needs to speak to him about it. What she said was completely cruel.", "NTA. She\u2019s a matter of months from being an adult. She should know better than to say something that cruel. I get her wanting to have a day with her dad, but talking to him about that instead of wishing death on your baby would be more effective.", "She's definitely old enough to be held up to what she has said. It's fine to be mad at her, but remember she's your husband's child: she'll be in your life for as long as you're with him. Take your time, but eventually you and her gotta have a conversation on your relationship. Have you considered family therapy?", "NTA. \n\nWhat she said probably was, infact, the impulsive frustration of a child. She certainly seems to be projecting her frustration and dissatisfaction onto you. After all, the father, being someone possessed of free will, is choosing to spend time with you. You aren't, as far as we know, a siren, enchanting him with your fishy ways. He's choosing to have more children with you. \n\nIf she's unhappy with the amount of time she spends with him, that's a discussion between her and him. Though, with how you planned out his time for graduation, it sounds like you give her plenty of thought and consideration. \n\nQuite reasonable that she should suffer some consequences for saying something nasty. She's going to need to get accustomed to that. \n\nBlacklisting her forever probably isn't tenable, without causing a lot of drama and friction, but it might be a valuable short term lesson.", "Info: Did she ever apologize for her outburst?", "NTA.\n\nShe's 17 years old, not 7. She needs to apologize immediately. It says a lot about her parents that her mom is trying to make excuses for her entitled, selfish daughter, instead of punishing her & making her do the right thing.", "INFO. Are you giving her pathway to correct and make up for her behavior to mend your relationship? \n\nIt's true that she is still a kid but kids need to learn how to handle their emotions without having nasty outbursts. She needs to have consequences but I don't think it would be fair to hold this against her forever.", "ESH\n\nFirst off, what she said was awful and you are right to be angry.\n\nBut her feelings are not invalid. It sounds like she has been bottling up her feelings for a long time because her father dated and then married someone she hates and her feelings did not stop him.\n\nIt makes sense that the graduation and birth was the event that triggered her finally unbottling. Let's be honest: her life is meaningfully worse for her than the version of it without you in it. You and her father may not care about that, but her perception of her world is real to her, and she has had to share her life with a stepparent and half siblings she never wanted.\n\nHer dad is entitled to move on, but there are consequences. You are entitled to marry someone whose daughter hates you without particularly caring that the daughter's feelings matter, but there are consequences. And the daughter is entitled to say how she truly feels to anyone who is occupying a parental role in her life, but there are consequences.\n\nDaughter is an asshole for saying somethin mean to you without caring about your feelings, but then its not like she has much experience in this household being shown that her own feelings matter.", "NTA, i wouldn't blame you at all. She's old enought to face her actions, and she really regrets what she said, she's also old enoght to apologize", "NTA. What she said is awful and she needs to apologize, she's 17, she is able to understand the weight of words, i also think your plan for day it is the right compromise to meet everyone's needs. \n\nHaving said that it seems to me that you have a bigger problem to deal with, I don't want to accuse you of anything but from what you wrote initially it seems that your relationship with your stepdaughter was good after an initial difficult period, judging her reaction to me it doesn't seem like that, indeed it is clear how she resents you so much and regards you as the cause why her relationship with her father is not as she would like especially since your two children were born (otherwise she wouldn't have accused you of taking her father away from her and she wouldn't have told you to stop having children here and there) so I can't help but wonder if this reaction is justified by the fact that your husband prioritizes you and your two children over her by significantly decreasing the time spent between them alone or it is only the result of selfishness and unjustified jealousy. In any case the best solution is to sit down and have an open one-on-one conversation and possibly go into family therapy to make things better because whether you like it or not she is your husband's daughter and your children's sister and that she like it or not you are the wife of his father and the mother of his sisters and this situation will lead to no good causing irreparable damage within the family.", "NTA\n\n She is old enough to understand what she said. After this, i would make damn sure she wouldn't be left alone with my kids. The nerve of her asking you for money after saying she wished your child to die.... hopefully she goes away to college and never comes back", "NTA.", "When I was in college - not much older than the step-daughter - my father worked so hard at his job and for four years running was unable to come up for Parents Weekend. Yeah, it sucked to not be a part of that. But he made sure to come up at least once a month and do fun things with me.\n\nMaybe once her graduation is over and the baby is here, you can work with him to make some time for just the two of them. None of the other children, just one-on-one time for her with your husband?", "NTA because that's a really horrible thing to hear. Need a better plan moving forward though.\nOther than you no longer doing things for her, what was the consequence for her for saying that?", "NTA\n\nDad needs to speak with her. Tell her that while frustration is normal, it's never ok to speak like that, and shoe owes you an apology, and the baby. But he also needs to apologize to her for, I'm assuming, not spending enough one on one time with JUST her.", "[deleted]", "I almost wanna say N A H, you were both in a stressful and tense situation. I don\u2019t blame you for holding your ground \n\nbut\n\nPart of being a kid, no matter your age or even maturity is lashing out to your parents. I don\u2019t think it would be healthy to hold a grudge over an emotional outburst, especially if it comes from a place of feeling abandoned by her father who has now made a *new and better* family for himself. \n\nINFO: how long had you been coming up with this plan? Was she aware of your due date or the potential for her graduation day to become just a graduation ceremony?", "NTA - Your stepdaughter is misguided, she has had her Dad for 9 years all to herself. There will be 3 more children now that will have to split the Dad 4 ways. Sure circumstances have changed and she has struggled to accept it but you have tried your best, I wouldn't blame you for not bothering to try any more.", "NTA, she was way out of pocket, and also mere moments away from being Of Age for fucking around and finding out. She says that sort of thing to her not-family she's going to have some serious problems.", "Info: What was her expectation regarding her dads attendance? Was this discussed before with her?\n\nNTA, she is about to be an adult and said an ugly and evil thing to you", "She is a kid, and she said a terrible thing out of some pretty valid feelings of losing her dad to his new family that doesn\u2019t feel like her family.\n\nShe should apologize - her mom can\u2019t do that for her. If she apologizes you should try to get past it.", "NTA - I hope she will come around and apologizes for what she said. It doesn't sound like you are being unkind to her just more like redirecting her to other parental figures when she needs something, which I think is fair and appropriate.", "At 17 there should be some semblance of a brain to mouth filter. It might not always work properly, but  in that case she should be the one apologizing and not her mom.   \nNTA...", "The one thing I learned from raising 2 daughters is that they will say things impulsively but not really mean them.  The portion of their brain that controls reasoning is not fully developed.  My girls said some pretty mean things, and even though it hurt I understood that it was impulsive.  They felt bad even if they never admitted it.  Forgive her immaturity as she is still growing and developing.  Kids that age are still pretty self centered and haven't quite learned that the world does not revolve around them.  Show her love, understanding and compassion and she will learn from it.  I don't think anyone here is the asshole.", "I\u2019d be polite and nothing more.\n\nWhen she can acknowledge what she did was terribly wrong, accept that the consequence is that your relationship has changed, promise to never speak that way again, and give you time to forgive, you can start over, if you want.\nFocus on your health, delivery, newborn, other children. \n\nShe\u2019s get polite. No rides, no money, no pictures, no gifts, no interest, no celebrations.\nShe has other people to do that. \n\nI\u2019d be polite like I\u2019m polite when the mail delivery person comes every day.  Maybe a wave. Hello. \nOff to live my life. \n\nFUFO.", "ESH - What she said was unacceptable and she owes you an apology. 17 years old doesn\u2019t excuse it.\n\nThat said, I think you are downplaying the significance of the beginning of your relationship and, unless she is truly a monster, a comment like this doesn\u2019t just come out of the blue. This story feels almost deliberately one-sided.", "She would be dead to me", "YTA. What she said was horrible and insensitive and bratty, no doubt about that, but she's a teenager so no big surprises there, but right now you are acting as childish as her, you are an adult you need to act like one or this will only get worse.", "NTA\nAnd let me guess, when it's not about her graduation,  or it's not her vs stepmom, she couldn't be arsed to spend time with her dad.", "NAH--let me explain.\n\nOP is NTA, she is very pregnant and those hormones be real.  What the daughter said was as low as you can go and should not have been said.  I think OP is being very reasonable with her suggestions.  \n\nOP stepdaughter is NTA.  High school graduations are also loaded with hormones--What am I going to do after graduation?  What will happen with my friends?  What will happen with my family?  Am I a grown up now?  A 17 year old should know better, and if she said it at any other time than graduation I would say she is the AH but she said it at a confusing time for a teenager.  A 17 year old is NOT an adult, stop trying to treat them as such.  The brain map of a 17 and a 25 year old are so different.", "INFO - did you break up the first marriage?", "OMG that's horrible OP I feel so bad for you. I wish you and your baby great health in the future and you should definitely consider monitoring her when she's around your baby. You're 101% NTA and her mom needs to stop enabling her behaviour AND SHE HASN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE TO YOU?  She probably feels no remorse. Also did you talk about this with your husband? + What did he say?", "NTA normally I\u2019d tell you to take the high road and talk it out but dang you are super pregnant you should not have that burden on you. Focus on you and your squish be polite to the stepdaughter but gray rock her for your own mental health.

She\u2019s old enough to know how terrible that comment is. I think you have a bigger family dynamic issue at play. She\u2019s always going to be part of your blended family & it would be better if all of you could work through the situation. Please get family therapy. It\u2019s very common for people to resent step parents & new half siblings or even just siblings with a large age gap.", "Holy hell \ud83d\ude33 This young lady needs professional help. You are NTA.

Its doesn't have to be equal, it has to be *fair*.  \n\nIt's natural (and accurate) that she sees you and each additional child as taking more and more of her dad's time and attention.

Your husband needs a reality check that his oldest wished death on the baby you\u2019re still pregnant with! You are not obligated to do things for her or give her money, that is her parents\u2019 job and you are not her parent. I would look into family therapy and find a way to explain to your husband how you feel. She is not a child anymore as much as he wants her to continue being his little girl. She is almost 18 (I imagine since she\u2019s graduating) and she\u2019ll legally be an adult.

Sometimes being a mom and stepmom, you have to understand that you took on the ugly with the good, and you did it because you were older and wiser than the babies you were going to have.
