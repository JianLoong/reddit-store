{"id": 18223, "submission_id": "13sfyyy", "title": "AITA for no longer doing anything for my stepdaughter after she disrespected me.", "selftext": "I f38 have been married to my husband f45 for 7 years. We have two kids together f5, and f3, and my currently pregnant with our third. He also has a daughter from a previous relationship who is 17 years old. Since being with my husband she at first never liked me and made it known she doesn't like me. I admit at first I was pushy because I wanted her to like me and I wanted to be considered a friend but I have a sense apologized and instead show her my love by doing favors for her. Since then we have had an okay relationship and I was happy with that because I wanted to take it at her pace. That being said me and my husband were talking about how we were gonna manage him going to her graduation. \n\nShe is graduating on June 20th but my due date is on June 19th. The plan is if I gave birth on time he would go to the graduation and then come back but if I didn't then he would spend the whole day with her. We told her our plan and told her regardless her father would be at her graduation but there's a chance he may have to leave after. This got her super upset and she started yelling that she could never have her dad for herself and she deserves to have the dad for the whole day. She then told me she was tired of me having kids left and right and I was stealing her dad away. She ended her argument by saying she hated me and that she wishes the baby would d*e. After what she said I haven't been doing anything for her. Whenever she asks for anything I say ask her mom or dad. Whenever she needs money I say the same thing. I can't get over the fact she wished d*ath on my child. I've been getting texts from her mom saying she didn't mean it and that she's a kid and she shouldn't be held responsible for something said out of anger but I believe she's old enough to know what she's doing and saying.\n\nEdit: A lot of you guys are saying I'm an asshole for taking time to myself. She made it clear that I mean nothing to her and even went as far as to wish death on my unborn child. I'm not gonna let someone disrespect me and then come around and do everything for them. She can go to her mother and father since she holds them so highly. Thank you to the people who say to focus on myself and my pregnancy. I will and of course my two other kids. I don't know if I can stay with my husband because of him not sticking up for him and we may separate for a bit meaning he would have to find somewhere else to stay since I own the home. As for the people saying she didn't ask for me to come into her life and for other siblings that's something she needs to take to her father. He was the one who married me and the one who impregnated me. As for the ones asking if I have a step-parent. Yes, I did. My mother remarried when I was 12 and I was always respectful we have a great relationship and I consider him my kid's granddad.\n\nAnother edit: No, I didn't get pregnant to spite her. It was in the moment and we weren't thinking about her graduation. And for the people saying she deserves to have her dad for the day she can. I don't care anymore. I'll always be seen as the bad guy because I want my husband with me if I give birth. Either way, he can spend the whole day with her if he likes, and ill just have my friend be with me.", "created_utc": 1685114253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sfyyy/aita_for_no_longer_doing_anything_for_my/", "score": 973, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is old enough to think before she speaks. If she feels that she not spending enough time with her dad then she needs to speak to him about it. What she said was completely cruel.", "NTA. She\u2019s a matter of months from being an adult. She should know better than to say something that cruel. I get her wanting to have a day with her dad, but talking to him about that instead of wishing death on your baby would be more effective.", "She's definitely old enough to be held up to what she has said. It's fine to be mad at her, but remember she's your husband's child: she'll be in your life for as long as you're with him. Take your time, but eventually you and her gotta have a conversation on your relationship. Have you considered family therapy?", "NTA. \n\nWhat she said probably was, infact, the impulsive frustration of a child. She certainly seems to be projecting her frustration and dissatisfaction onto you. After all, the father, being someone possessed of free will, is choosing to spend time with you. You aren't, as far as we know, a siren, enchanting him with your fishy ways. He's choosing to have more children with you. \n\nIf she's unhappy with the amount of time she spends with him, that's a discussion between her and him. Though, with how you planned out his time for graduation, it sounds like you give her plenty of thought and consideration. \n\nQuite reasonable that she should suffer some consequences for saying something nasty. She's going to need to get accustomed to that. \n\nBlacklisting her forever probably isn't tenable, without causing a lot of drama and friction, but it might be a valuable short term lesson.", "Info: Did she ever apologize for her outburst?", "NTA.\n\nShe's 17 years old, not 7. She needs to apologize immediately. It says a lot about her parents that her mom is trying to make excuses for her entitled, selfish daughter, instead of punishing her & making her do the right thing.", "INFO. Are you giving her pathway to correct and make up for her behavior to mend your relationship? \n\nIt's true that she is still a kid but kids need to learn how to handle their emotions without having nasty outbursts. She needs to have consequences but I don't think it would be fair to hold this against her forever.", "ESH\n\nFirst off, what she said was awful and you are right to be angry.\n\nBut her feelings are not invalid. It sounds like she has been bottling up her feelings for a long time because her father dated and then married someone she hates and her feelings did not stop him.\n\nIt makes sense that the graduation and birth was the event that triggered her finally unbottling. Let's be honest: her life is meaningfully worse for her than the version of it without you in it. You and her father may not care about that, but her perception of her world is real to her, and she has had to share her life with a stepparent and half siblings she never wanted.\n\nHer dad is entitled to move on, but there are consequences. You are entitled to marry someone whose daughter hates you without particularly caring that the daughter's feelings matter, but there are consequences. And the daughter is entitled to say how she truly feels to anyone who is occupying a parental role in her life, but there are consequences.\n\nDaughter is an asshole for saying somethin mean to you without caring about your feelings, but then its not like she has much experience in this household being shown that her own feelings matter.", "NTA, i wouldn't blame you at all. She's old enought to face her actions, and she really regrets what she said, she's also old enoght to apologize", "NTA. What she said is awful and she needs to apologize, she's 17, she is able to understand the weight of words, i also think your plan for day it is the right compromise to meet everyone's needs. \n\nHaving said that it seems to me that you have a bigger problem to deal with, I don't want to accuse you of anything but from what you wrote initially it seems that your relationship with your stepdaughter was good after an initial difficult period, judging her reaction to me it doesn't seem like that, indeed it is clear how she resents you so much and regards you as the cause why her relationship with her father is not as she would like especially since your two children were born (otherwise she wouldn't have accused you of taking her father away from her and she wouldn't have told you to stop having children here and there) so I can't help but wonder if this reaction is justified by the fact that your husband prioritizes you and your two children over her by significantly decreasing the time spent between them alone or it is only the result of selfishness and unjustified jealousy. In any case the best solution is to sit down and have an open one-on-one conversation and possibly go into family therapy to make things better because whether you like it or not she is your husband's daughter and your children's sister and that she like it or not you are the wife of his father and the mother of his sisters and this situation will lead to no good causing irreparable damage within the family.", "NTA\n\n She is old enough to understand what she said. After this, i would make damn sure she wouldn't be left alone with my kids. The nerve of her asking you for money after saying she wished your child to die.... hopefully she goes away to college and never comes back", "NTA.", "When I was in college - not much older than the step-daughter - my father worked so hard at his job and for four years running was unable to come up for Parents Weekend. Yeah, it sucked to not be a part of that. But he made sure to come up at least once a month and do fun things with me.\n\nMaybe once her graduation is over and the baby is here, you can work with him to make some time for just the two of them. None of the other children, just one-on-one time for her with your husband?", "NTA because that's a really horrible thing to hear. Need a better plan moving forward though.\nOther than you no longer doing things for her, what was the consequence for her for saying that?", "NTA\n\nDad needs to speak with her. Tell her that while frustration is normal, it's never ok to speak like that, and shoe owes you an apology, and the baby. But he also needs to apologize to her for, I'm assuming, not spending enough one on one time with JUST her.", "[deleted]", "I almost wanna say N A H, you were both in a stressful and tense situation. I don\u2019t blame you for holding your ground \n\nbut\n\nPart of being a kid, no matter your age or even maturity is lashing out to your parents. I don\u2019t think it would be healthy to hold a grudge over an emotional outburst, especially if it comes from a place of feeling abandoned by her father who has now made a *new and better* family for himself. \n\nINFO: how long had you been coming up with this plan? Was she aware of your due date or the potential for her graduation day to become just a graduation ceremony?", "NTA - Your stepdaughter is misguided, she has had her Dad for 9 years all to herself. There will be 3 more children now that will have to split the Dad 4 ways. Sure circumstances have changed and she has struggled to accept it but you have tried your best, I wouldn't blame you for not bothering to try any more.", "NTA, she was way out of pocket, and also mere moments away from being Of Age for fucking around and finding out. She says that sort of thing to her not-family she's going to have some serious problems.", "Info: What was her expectation regarding her dads attendance? Was this discussed before with her?\n\nNTA, she is about to be an adult and said an ugly and evil thing to you", "She is a kid, and she said a terrible thing out of some pretty valid feelings of losing her dad to his new family that doesn\u2019t feel like her family.\n\nShe should apologize - her mom can\u2019t do that for her. If she apologizes you should try to get past it.", "NTA - I hope she will come around and apologizes for what she said. It doesn't sound like you are being unkind to her just more like redirecting her to other parental figures when she needs something, which I think is fair and appropriate.", "At 17 there should be some semblance of a brain to mouth filter. It might not always work properly, but  in that case she should be the one apologizing and not her mom.   \nNTA...", "The one thing I learned from raising 2 daughters is that they will say things impulsively but not really mean them.  The portion of their brain that controls reasoning is not fully developed.  My girls said some pretty mean things, and even though it hurt I understood that it was impulsive.  They felt bad even if they never admitted it.  Forgive her immaturity as she is still growing and developing.  Kids that age are still pretty self centered and haven't quite learned that the world does not revolve around them.  Show her love, understanding and compassion and she will learn from it.  I don't think anyone here is the asshole.", "I\u2019d be polite and nothing more.\n\nWhen she can acknowledge what she did was terribly wrong, accept that the consequence is that your relationship has changed, promise to never speak that way again, and give you time to forgive, you can start over, if you want.\nFocus on your health, delivery, newborn, other children. \n\nShe\u2019s get polite. No rides, no money, no pictures, no gifts, no interest, no celebrations.\nShe has other people to do that. \n\nI\u2019d be polite like I\u2019m polite when the mail delivery person comes every day.  Maybe a wave. Hello. \nOff to live my life. \n\nFUFO.", "ESH - What she said was unacceptable and she owes you an apology. 17 years old doesn\u2019t excuse it.\n\nThat said, I think you are downplaying the significance of the beginning of your relationship and, unless she is truly a monster, a comment like this doesn\u2019t just come out of the blue. This story feels almost deliberately one-sided.", "She would be dead to me", "YTA. What she said was horrible and insensitive and bratty, no doubt about that, but she's a teenager so no big surprises there, but right now you are acting as childish as her, you are an adult you need to act like one or this will only get worse.", "NTA\nAnd let me guess, when it's not about her graduation,  or it's not her vs stepmom, she couldn't be arsed to spend time with her dad.", "NAH--let me explain.\n\nOP is NTA, she is very pregnant and those hormones be real.  What the daughter said was as low as you can go and should not have been said.  I think OP is being very reasonable with her suggestions.  \n\nOP stepdaughter is NTA.  High school graduations are also loaded with hormones--What am I going to do after graduation?  What will happen with my friends?  What will happen with my family?  Am I a grown up now?  A 17 year old should know better, and if she said it at any other time than graduation I would say she is the AH but she said it at a confusing time for a teenager.  A 17 year old is NOT an adult, stop trying to treat them as such.  The brain map of a 17 and a 25 year old are so different.", "INFO - did you break up the first marriage?", "OMG that's horrible OP I feel so bad for you. I wish you and your baby great health in the future and you should definitely consider monitoring her when she's around your baby. You're 101% NTA and her mom needs to stop enabling her behaviour AND SHE HASN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE TO YOU?  She probably feels no remorse. Also did you talk about this with your husband? + What did he say?", "NTA normally I\u2019d tell you to take the high road and talk it out but dang you are super pregnant you should not have that burden on you. Focus on you and your squish be polite to the stepdaughter but gray rock her for your own mental health.

She\u2019s old enough to know how terrible that comment is. I think you have a bigger family dynamic issue at play. She\u2019s always going to be part of your blended family & it would be better if all of you could work through the situation. Please get family therapy. It\u2019s very common for people to resent step parents & new half siblings or even just siblings with a large age gap.", "Holy hell \ud83d\ude33 This young lady needs professional help. You are NTA.

You would think my dad was spending so much time with me in my youth \u2026 truth is as a 27 year old guy trying to raise a kid he simply didn\u2019t have time. When you are not as established at 27, you are required to focus more on work, work more hours etc. My brother got a lot more time with my dad compared to me at the same age. I don\u2019t know if this also applies to your stepdaughter but it could be a factor. That your kids are getting what she never had at the same age. And when her dad finally has more time, part of it is being shared. \n\nMy parents are also divorced, my younger brother is my half brother. It\u2019s an interesting situation to be in. You have 2 homes yet no home at the same time. Both families would look so much more perfect if I (the stepkid) didn\u2019t exist. My very existence is that reminder to both families that there was a previous failed marriage in what are now 2 perfect families. Even if her birth mom didn\u2019t remarry, she may wonder if her mom could have married and settled down happily if not for her. \n\nYou made the comment about all that you do for her, and how you made your house feel like her home. Here is the thing, had her parents not divorced. This would be her home. She was 10 when you met, what were you going to make your house feel like if not home? I get the master bedroom when I go to my dads house. My dad will move to the guest bedroom to ensure I get the best room. The room is massive and has a balcony overlooking city views, sauna in the bathroom, a computer desk, dressing table and TV. And on top of this I actually have a room that is mine in the house where I can kept some things. But despite all it doesn\u2019t feel like home, I don\u2019t know how to explain it. He\u2019s trying I\u2019m trying\u2026 but I still feel like a guest. I\u2019m a bit less insecure about this as I\u2019m financially independent with my own place. Your stepdaughter at 17 doesn\u2019t have my luxury. \n\nYour stepdaughter sounds extremely insecure. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s necessarily evil or really wished yours or anyone\u2019s child harm.

What if my son does?", "You can't make someone apologize, it wouldn't be sincere too. The daughter is old enough to realize her mistake and apologize by herself.", "I think Dad should talk to her. \n\nIt shouldn't be step mom's sole responsibility to help the girl process her own resentment towards her and also be her punching bag while very pregnant.\n\nBy not lashing out to the girl she's already the bigger person. Someone the teenager actually respects should be doing the talk- maybe the person whose attention she actually wants.\n\nShe should see some kind of consequences. Not getting any favors from step mom seems like natural ones to me. By all means, don't ignore her- but the sooner kiddo learns to think before they speak because relationships go two ways and repairing relationships take time and effort the better off she'll be.", "Thank you", "Plus, what does a teenager want to do that a toddler and a 5 year old would be entertained by? What would those two enjoy that a 17 year old would also like? \u201cEqual time with his daughters\u201d is gonna look different when two of them will have fun doing the same sort of things together, but the eldest will not. Exceptions could exist, like an amusement park, but dad\u2019s going to end up wrangling excited young kids, going to the kiddie stuff because they\u2019re too small for roller coasters, and that\u2019s just not fun either. She needs to spend time with him, going places she, a near adult, can enjoy and make memories with her father before the next chapter of her life starts. OP should find a family member, friend, or trusted babysitter, and have them come help her out with the young kids, if being overwhelmed during the last part of the pregnancy/the recovery is an issue. That way, stepdaughter gets her one on one time with her dad, and OP can choose to take some time to herself, even if it\u2019s just napping upstairs while someone\u2019s watching the kids downstairs. She could choose to take the kids somewhere age appropriate, instead, if she is up to it.\n\n\nI\u2019m guessing stepdaughter is going to uni in a few months. She knows she won\u2019t be able to spend time with her father as easily in a few months. One of the best things OP can give her is this extra time with her dad - the other kids will be just fine.", "Equal is fair in this case, she just needs therapy to shift her perspective.

She has basically the second master bedroom", "I can't agree with this. The daughter's anger towards OP isn't really about OP, it's about feeling neglected by her father. She's mad at OP in the same way that someone gets jealous when their best friend starts dating someone and they have to adjust the relationship. You can feel sad and disappointed sure, but expecting the people in your life to adhere to your standards of who they are and aren't allowed to be friends with or have relationships with is selfish and entitled. I feel like the daughter thinks her dad shouldn't be allowed to date anyone else. \n\nI get that she's 17, and honestly I would be more inclined to rule OP was AH if the daughter attempted to apologize and didn't accept, but daughter made it clear that she wants nothing to do with OP. Except I guess when she needs a favor? \n\nThere's childish mistakes, and rudeness, and then there's wishing your dad's wife miscarries because you're mad you don't get as much attention from your dad due to his life choice. OP did nothing wrong, NTA.", "It\u2019s not about what kid is allowed to feel, it\u2019s about how she\u2019s allowed to behave toward others. Her feelings are valid.

The girl hates her regardless of what she does for her, let her actual parents help her. Once you guys see stepkids and step parents on this sub you always always favor step children no matter how irritating and downright wrong the step kids are.", "Her husband moved into her house", "Interesting how they just started to plan the month before the due date. 17 is probably afraid the baby will be up coming on graduation day and she won\u2019t see her dad at all.", "Sincere apology is unrealistic.\n\nThis girl does not feel anything good towards step mom or future kid.

Not now, maybe not ever", "The criminals don't get free passes just because they are young.", "OP has stated in her comments that her stepdaughter\u2019s parents have decided to not punish her.

The only \u201cpunishment\u201d she has gotten is her stepmother refusing to give her money or do things for her and sending her to her actual parents for what she wants. Which is perfectly reasonable when you wish death on someone\u2019s unborn child.", "To be fair, OP isn't outright ignoring her. The stepdaughter approaches OP in a way that seems like \"nothing is wrong\" like asking OP for money. OP doesn't ignore her, OP tells her to move along and ask someone else. \n\nIf the stepdaughter is asking for money now, she has been asking and that would reflect an amount of comfort and trust. Things like that don't get maintained when people say things like how they hope a baby dies. \n\nA 17 yo wouldn't have the ability to to foresee all consequences, but this will be how she learns.

You have been told your opinion doesn\u2019t matter - this is for her father to tackle", "This is where sadly you just have to be the bigger person.  My (ex) stepdaughter said the same thing to me when I was pregnant with my son. Granted she was only 10, but she still said she wanted me to get hit by a bus and die. When it was explained the baby would die too she said it was okay because I was gone.  \n\nMy response was to walk away and go make dinner.  I didn't hold a grudge. I was the bigger person.  You as a parent should be able to understand when someone says something from a place of hurt. You need to be the adult and move past the comment. \n\nTo a 17 year old graduation is the biggest event of their life.  All she wants is for her dad to focus on her for the day. The timing of the delivery sucks and isn't something you can control.  I think you should have involved her in your decision on how to handle it.  \n\nShe is feeling more and more alienated from her dad with each kid you have.

Every day people with kids start new relationships and have to hope their kids bond with the new family. You got the bad ending. It wasn't malicious, but it is what it is.
