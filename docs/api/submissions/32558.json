I\u2019m tired of giving my cousins MY stuff, when I got my switch I only had 2-3 games why can it be the same for him? Why does he have to get all my stuff? I would do chores to save up money for my games but he gets them for free? And Ik this is pretty selfish of me but I dont want to give my cousin my games.

If they haven't given you reason to think they would get mad over something like this, then it feels like you might just be overthinking and building up the stakes of this question far higher than is reality.\n\nEven if you have games you don't really play anymore, if you have an emotional/sentimental connection to them and don't want to give them up then the answer to her should be no because that is the truth. You don't have any games you don't want.\n\nIf they have given you reason to think they will react to that response with anger, maybe try bringing it to your parents first and let them handle the interaction with grandma. A simple \"hey mom/stepdad, grandma asked me if I want to give up some of my games for cousin. I don't want to, but I don't want her to get angry with me for saying no, can you tell her that my stuff isn't up for grabs\" should be good and if your parents have your back I'm sure they'd be more than willing to go to bat for you on this.", "Let them get mad. Tell them to sell their stuff if they need money to buy games but it isn\u2019t the responsibility of a 15 year old to provide toys for his relatives.", "She's the one getting the kid a Switch when she's not including any games with it, this is her promise to not fully carry through.", "Just tell her that the games you have aren\u2019t appropriate for a kid that age. You\u2019re NTA. If it\u2019s easier you can say you got rid of the games you don\u2019t play already and then suggest one or two she could buy him", "I don\u2019t like lying as a rule, but I hate the thought that you\u2019ll be made to feel bad if you don\u2019t give up any of your games. \n\nSo you can just tell her that you traded in all your old games you outgrew for newer ones. \nShe\u2019ll never know, and you can let her know she should be able to buy used games for cousin. \n\nI don\u2019t game at all, but my kids still have all their old games. I and they would have never thought to give them away. They spent hours and hours playing through them. You keep them to remember the accomplishment of getting to the end.", "I've seen this argument a couple times, but it's really not true anymore. The price of secondhand switch games has fallen a lot in the past year. Now only the newest and biggest titles keep their 50$ price tag after opening. Most titles settle in the 15-35 range. \n\nUnless you're Super Mario 3D All Stars, in which case you just get to be expensive forever. \n\nStill NTA, obviously. The games could be 1$ each and platinumed, you should still keep them if they make you happy.", "I do, have a Switch myself.", "OP is the one who called themselves selfish, and I agreed. His cousin didn\u2019t ask, his grandmother did. Money sucks for a lot of people right now and she was probably hoping to save some IF he has games he doesn\u2019t use. But instead they will just sit around unused?", "Nah, mate. When they lay all their reasons on the table and you see it's just because he's selfish and doesn't want someone to have it better than him, it's not about not giving the games to the cousin. It's about why.", "I agree.  It's hard for kids (or even adults) to think \"No\" is a complete sentence.  Especially if they've been conditioned to justify that answer.   \"I'm sorry, Grandma, I don't have any games at the moment I can let cousin have.\" End of.  I don't think OP is an AH at all,  I think he's over-thinking, possibly because he does feel guilty, of all the reasons he can think of (as a child who is still too young to process feelings) instead of \"I just don't want to\". \n\nWe don't know his full background,  nor his family's to really judge him for this.\n\nI don't think Grandma is an AH either,  for asking.  As long as his answer is accepted and there is no attempt to guilt trip or punish him in some way for it.  \n\nI also agree with others about offering links  to places which sell second hand games,  and maybe putting a $10  Nintendo gift card towards his Christmas gift (if he has a good relationship with the cousin).", "Of course he doesn't have to give his games away. That's not what makes him an AH in my book. It's the reasons.\n\nHe literally says he knows he's being selfish. It's in his post.", "That's a weird way to look at it.\n\nGrandma doesn't want his switch games. Grandma wants Cousin to be able to have a few games for the switch that he's getting so she asked a family member who has a switch if they had any games they could let go of. \n\nIt's a simple ask (has nobody here ever had hand-me-downs?) but everybody's acting like she commanded him to sacrifice his firstborn.", "It's not about the keeping of the games. It's about his reasons. He literally could have said \"I still play all my games from time to time\" and I'd have said NTA.   \n\n\nBut the whole rest of the post paints him as an AH for the reasons that I stated above.", "Surely you know by now that you can do something that you have the right to do and still be an asshole? \n\nAnd no, part of his attitude is because of that. The rest is because he feels that his cousin should have the same \"struggles\" as he did. \n\n OP is a boy, btw.", "I can't even believe they said that! It's disgusting and definitely mental child abuse!", "Things*", "u/Unlikely-Werewolf125, Happy belated birthday!! I hope you had a wonderful day.", "Mine includes the deluxe edition of Origins, Omega edition of Odyssey as well as a steelbook for Odyssey, all secondhand.", "Couple years back when they visited my dads house they asked if my cousin could take my toys, it was like a big Batman headquarters and a big castle, and when my grandma asked me I said no, and my cousins mom got mad and so I felt bad and let them take it", "Well in the times we live in 35 dollars is alot of money.", "Then you know how expensive they are; OP might want to play them today, tomorrow, or hell maybe a year from now. I wouldn't even give the games I haven't played in 5 years away.", "You\u2019re purposely ignoring the part that OP or OP\u2019s mother and stepfather purchased the games. Dad\u2019s mother is definitely trying to get something from the ex.", ">Surely you know by now that you can do something that you have the right to do and still be an asshole?\n\nSurely it's clear what kind of mindset you possess!", "Maybe you didn\u2019t read OP\u2019s other comments, but his grandmother and this cousin\u2019s mother have guilted him in the past to give up his other toys that he was using. They are using/have used their role as adults  and probably the whole \u201crespect your elders\u201d mindset to push him into giving away his things. If they hadn\u2019t successfully done this in the past, he might be more inclined to be generous now. It is very easy for assholes to be generous with other people\u2019s belongings and/or money. We see it all the time on AITA where a spouse or family member gives away the poster\u2019s things so that they can look generous without having to put out their own money or sacrifice their own possessions. That is not how you teach young people generosity. That is how you teach them to be defensive about their things because they never know when they are going to be taken away in name of generosity. Good job teaching your grandson to be selfish, Grandma.", "Thanks", "I'd definitely say to bring this to your mom and step dad then (assuming they weren't there when this happened and weren't apart of the people forcing you to give it up). You should have never felt pressured into giving up your toys to your cousin then (honestly they shouldn't have even asked for it. I'm sorry they took something from you that you didn't want to give away, that's very cruel of them) and you shouldn't feel pressured to give up your games now. \n\nYou are allowed to have things that are yours and you shouldn't be made to feel bad if you want to keep them. I doubt your cousin's mom would just give you something of hers because you asked for it, so it's not a reasonable expectation for her to have of you either. Lean on your mom and stepdad for some support in this if you can and hopefully they can handle your grandma and aunt for you.", "My adult sons will go back and play older games. They take breaks from playing them for a while then will go back and play again.\n\nThe only time they get rid of games is when they don't like them, and then they try to sell them to Game Stop or the indie vintage game store.", "If I'm ignoring that then you're ignoring how the games went from being \"purchased by his family\" to him having to \"do chores to save up money for his games.\"\n\nOP got some *for free* from Mom and Dad. He bought others.\n\nGrandma simply thinks it would be nice for Cousin to have more games. Idk why you're making things up about her based on her asking if one of her grandkids had something that he was willing to give to one of her other grandkids.", "Thank you. I *am* a giver! :D"]}
