Especially if the divorce was due to her actions and not yours. That would be a very awkward situation.", "NAH\n\nbut, she only gets one mom. I would try to help support her rebuilding that relationship as a co-parent. Unless neglect or abuse was involved, I don't like the whole \"not your wife, not your problem\" attitude.

I said, as long as the other parent is not harmful in some way to the child. Meaning if there's no worries of physical or emotional abuse, addiction, etc. It would likely be helpful for the child to have healthy relationships with both parents. Again, there may be reasons that it would be worse for the child than better, but without knowing specifics, I couldn't say one way or the other. Not sure why you're so caught up on my comment since I didn't definitively state one way or the other and asked a simple question, but if you're beyond understanding something even that basic then I feel no need to explain further. Have a great day!", ">I said, as long as the other parent is not harmful in some way to the child.\n\nSo, the issue here is that you don't understand that there's a middle ground between \"harmful\" and \"beneficial\".\n\nFor instance, a rock.
