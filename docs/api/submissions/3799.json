We love our kids more than anything, but there are days we are just trying to stay afloat. My wife sometimes finds herself extremely stressed.\n\nMy mom also had three kids. I'm sure she had her own internal struggles, but she was really chill and everything just seemed smooth and easy for her. To be honest i have no idea how she did it, but she always looked good, dinner was always on the table, and we behaved in public.

I hardly saw him and I'm pretty sure he had a girlfriend in an apartment somewhere \n\nThis isn't to compare them at all, but I think it explains why my mom can be impatient or snarky with us. We obviously don't live up to her standards. Her attitude has pissed me off for a while. She doesn't even say much but we can just tell that she thinks we are failing.\n\nRecently my wife had a breakdown in front of the family and began to cry over how bad she thought she looked in a family picture. I immidiatley tried to comfort her, but she was distraught and the rest of the family was standing around awkwardly. \n\nI could hear my mom, dad, and dad's wife talking in the background and my dad's wife jokingly said my mom should help out and babysit. My mom rolled her eyes and said why should she. She never had a babysitter with us yet found time for self care, hobbies, and multiple affairs. Ok I was going to internally roll my eyes and let that one go, but then I heard my mom mutter \"I don't know if it is stupidity or laziness, but she needs to get it together. It isn't even this hard, the hell, you are going to cry about it?\"\n\nI snapped and demanded she repeat it. My mom did make a face like oh shit, but said if I was yelling i obviously heard her. I called her a bitch and told her to get out. My wife told her to go fuck herself and maybe it would make her less uptight which I laughed at. I told my mom that she needs to leave and can only come back if she apologizes on her knees. That is the only way I will truly believe she is sorry, as she tends to give shitty apologizes while smirking or giggling. My mom yelled at me that I was delusional and claims my wife is exhausting and the whole family hates her.\n\nMy mom is now banned and I'm dead serious about the kneeling. She claims it's fine and she will just never come. I decided we should host Christmas this year (typically my mom's thing and she looooves it) and maintain the ban.

She sounds depressed or just really self focused, unable to tell based on short info. \n\nYour wife made everyone uncomfortable because she didn\u2019t like how she looked- that was an asshole move unless she seriously is having mental health problems. Your mom made a judgmental shitty comment- that was an asshole move. You are trying to completely degrade a family member, while also trying to get more drama started by pulling in outside spectators in your family- that\u2019s an asshole move. \n\nYou are signing up to host a big event that is already expected to be drama filled, when your wife is at such a low point that a bad picture is enough to have a breakdown over- this is just a stupid decision lol. It\u2019s like cutting off your nose to spite your face.", "Just go no contact with your mum and other family members, they sound really toxic.", "WTF? It was okay to say it because you weren't meant to hear it and just because you heard it doesn't mean you should take offense? On what planet does that make sense?

Plus ur mother started it", "NTA, I would never place a perfunctory \u201con the knees\u201d requirement, (talk about a performative requirement that doesn\u2019t convey introspection or apology), but I would definitely require a genuine and heartfelt apology that wasn\u2019t a mere recitation of words. My MIL has also done many hurtful things and only ever offered pathetic sorrybut\u2019s with excuses and \u2018two-way-street\u2019s attached, so I understand holding a ban rather than honoring an unsympathetic gesture.

Kudos to OP for sticking up for your wife, because what your mom said was unforgivable.", "Back when your mom was raising you, it was completely fine to beat your butt if you got out of line, and if \"when your father gets home\" is ever said, it's 100Xs worse.... we don't do these things to our children anymore. \n\nThe reason you were almost so well behaved was out of fear   and I cannot speak for how your raising your children   I commend you for the fact that they obviously don't fear you. Yes you may want to look at alternatives to getting the kids in check.

Put up or Shut up!! .. her comments were uncalled for. \n\nMaybe not literally on her knees...  but she's definitely gotta prove without a doubt.", "She's always been looking for a way to take over Christmas", "The on her knees part is just creepy.

I think it's more ESH on the part of the wife because OP says his wife has been looking for a way to 'take over' Christmas. The breakdown seems a bit manipulative in that case.", "Well if you have lot of stress piling up, then even smallest thing can make you cry (i have started crying over insignificant things when i have been way too stressed). Yes, therapy is good idea or getting at least some help, but i don't think that crying some picture makes her AH or at least that is my opinion. That something isn't big thing to us doesn't mean that isn't important to someone. We all are different.\n\nBut instead waiting mom to say sorry on the knees, OP should just go low contact. So yeah I kind of also think ESH. In my opinion, the yelling and cussing was unnecessary.", "As an \"older generation\" person, I think I can speak to this mis-conception. We were not in any way perfect. There just isn't any evidence otherwise. We also were liberally prescribed psychiatric meds.\n\nI got ONE childcare manual when I came home from the hospital. ONE. I did not have to sort through the gazillion different methods for every single aspect of childcare there are on line. Each one wanting to sell you something. I told a friend recently that he was not going to break his newborn. He was so pathetically relieved. It was the first time he ever heard that. I went on to tell him that people have been successfully raising babies long before the internet was invented. He really just had to follow his doctor's advice, and trust himself. Parents these days are under so much unnecessary pressure to buy all he things, and to do all the things perfectly at just the perfect moment in their child's development. Back in the day, we all just fell for the playing Mozart to the embryo in order to make our kiddos geniuses. Don't get me wrong, there was pressure to do things right back then, but it is so much more overwhelming and coming from all directions these days. Everyone online thinks they know the one true way to raise a perfect kiddo and shame anyone who disagrees.\n\nThere is also the ramped up pressure to be the perfect family with the perfect home, serving perfect meals to perfectly behaved children all caught on camera to be shared on social media with the entire world to judge. We had that same pressure, but only those people who visited us knew if we kept it up every single moment of every single day.  We redecorated our homes once every decade or so, but did not have to worry about what our aesthetic was. We might take pictures at home occasionally, but they were maybe shared with a few people. Film was expensive. Also, DIY was not a mainstream thing like it is now. No one was duping anything in order to look more bougie than they actually were. We never had to \"refresh\" with the new decor or color of the year, or get rid of whatever was no longer considered fashionable. I won't even go into all the self-care stuff, working out however much doctors and fitness gurus currently think is best, organizing everything all while looking fantastic with your 50 step beauty routine and carefully curated capsule wardrobe. I don't have kids and am not on social media much, but I still feel the pressure of all of this. \n\nAnother big difference was that we were taught to suck it up. If you can, take a pill, drink a drink, and pretend it is fine. Instead of having a breakdown, OPs mom had affairs. I am also pretty sure she had other pretty unhealthy ways of coping that happened behind doors. We used to keep that sort of thing from the kiddos.\n\nFinally, as they were old enough, we could let our kiddos play in the yard unsupervised, walk home from the bus/school alone, ride their bikes up and down the street or to practice, and go to the playground with their friends. We did not have to mediate every moment of their lives. Trust me, that frees up a lot of time. \n\nIt is unfair to compare us to current parents, because the context is so much different. We all have/had our unhealthy coping mechanisms. Although, at least OP's DW can actually identify and express her feelings. I would have been nice to have been able to feel like I could have done the same when I was a young mother.", "On her knees?

Looking at a picture can absolutely trigger some bodily image issues so the responses here calling her vain are completely off the mark.\n\nNow does she need therapy or counseling, for sure.", "I didn't say that you can't be ugly and confident but FEELING ugly and being as confident as she is to ruin a family gathering with the feelings of someone with SUCH low self esteem, the key word here is ESTEEM, she should feel like trash yet she is so precious to be the center of the attentions that's truly a first. She knows how your mother is and did that on purpose cause she knew what reaction she would get she is trying to pull you away from your family.", "This isn\u2019t just any woman this is your mom. You know the saying the way a man treats his mom is how he treats his wife.", "He said she had a breakdown. That's not just shedding a few tears. And I never said I was better but having intense emotional reactions like that at a gathering like that without trying to remove yourself is actually incredibly selfish. It makes everyone awkward and embarrassed, makes it all about you and completely ruins the event for everyone. Showing emotions is fine but this is ridiculous attention seeking behaviour.", "It has nothing to do with vanity and everything about losing control over your own body, people need to show more sympathy", "This is my favorite answer", "I guessing his mom meant relationships of some certain not cheating", "Lmfaooo", "I was so confused for so long- maybe that\u2019s my sign to go to bed but I love that", "Yes, all women cry only to get their way and manipulate people. /s\n\n GTFO dude.", "And I think that is a ridiculous saying. Actually it is beyond that. It is offensive to every man who has a bad mother and it has a weird incestuous vibe. My dad is the most doting husband (well to wife #2 at least) and he wouldn't piss on his mom if she was on fire", "All women? No no no, only this one. People? She is only trying to manipulate her man.", "Do you know how lucky you are? I was beaten as a child and put in foster care. Do you know how lucky you are to have a mom and dad who love you even though your mom is not a warm person?", "She's exhausted and her mother in law is a hag.", "No, I'm sorry that happened to you, but trauma is not a competition. I know I had a great childhood and I am thankful, but that is not a free pass for her to belittle my wife", "She's exhausted but she'll host the party now HAPPILY, get a clue!", "On that we can agree, two things can be true at the same time, was just giving my piece in a totally sided report about a situation that I dunno nothing about!", "Without the snide, fat-headed bog mummy in attendance, it sounds like it'll be a vacation in comparison.", "It was my mother that was the crazy one. She was insufferable, and anything she was at had an exponential layer of bullshit spread onto everything. \n\nIf you're a guest at someone's house, don't talk shit about them. It's not hard, but apparently Mummy Dearest doesn't have any manners... \n\nOh yeah, NTA"]}
