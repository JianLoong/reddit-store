A memorial show isn\u2019t going to be the same as a broadway. That\u2019d be like auditioning for an opera but singing/acting as if you were trying out for a musical.\n\nIt sucks that your family is against you performing especially when you know someone who was personally affected. They need to get a grip.", "NTA\n\nsorry your family sucks.", "NTA - you got picked and she didn't. That's how auditions work. Were you supposed to walk out when she botched her tryout?", "NTA- Your sister wasn't right for the role, doesn't mean you should miss out on what sounds like a moving opportunity to comfort grieving families. Shame your family wasn't supportive of you.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your sister both auditioned for the memorial. You were asked to sing and she wasn't. That's OK. It doesn't have to be \"even\".\n\nWhat's next - you can't get good grades unless your sister does too? You can only accept a college place if your sister thinks she could be admitted to the same college?", "NTA. In no way are you the A H. You won your audition fair and square. If you and sis were competing for a million dollar movie deal and you won't but she didn't, would everyone expect you to just throw it away to make her feel better? Yeah, it's not the same scale, but they're being ridiculous and coddling her. She's old enough to get that life won't always go her way and some people will be better choices. The fact that your family is acting like they do is crazy to me....", "NTA. It wasn't like you intentionally took this opportunity from her. Both of y'all were interested; she just didn't make it. Instead of being a hater, she should be proud of you. And WTF is wrong with your parents?!?", "NTA.\n\nThe school felt that your sister wasn't a good fit. It had nothing to do with you. I understand her disappointment, but she and the rest of your family are big AHs for taking it out on you.", "You're NTA. It sounds like she was given a fair audition but wasn't chosen. It is unreasonable to expect you to miss out on the opportunity just because your sister doesn't get to participate. \n\nNot understanding why you're being punished for succeeding.", "NTA \nYour sister didn\u2019t make the cut, but you did it\u2019s that simple. Just because she didn\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s your choice and not your fault that she failed it.", "You are NTA-\n\nHere\u2019s the thing- all performances you have to audition for are competitive. And some people get the spot and some people don\u2019t. It sucks to be left out. And it is a hard lesson to learn at 15 that these things aren\u2019t fair. Especially after she lost her friend. \n\nBut you should never, EVER turn down your flame because others don\u2019t shine as brightly. Try to keep compassion in your heart- but don\u2019t give up your spot. And don\u2019t feel guilty for getting it. She will find her chances and places to shine.", "OP is NTA\n\nYou and your sister (and your brother) don't have to share all the same activities.  I understand that rejection is hard, but it's a something everyone should learn how to deal with.  Another difficult lesson to learn that life isn't inherently fair.\n\nSince the sister is younger, it sounds like she will have future opportunities to sing for this memorial ceremony.  I don't understand why OP's parents are grounding her--is the grounding preventing OP's from participating in the memorial ceremony?", "NTA\n\nWhat\u2019s not fair is you getting grounded and not your sister.  Also, is this pattern with your parents normal? You guys are 15 and 17 not 2/3. You both auditioned and you got that part fair and sqaure.", "NTA life isn't \"fair\" and you've been practicing longer than her, that's no one's faults but I would just reassure her that she did great and she'll do even better next year", "NTA.", "NTA you have a personal connection as to why you\u2019re wanting to perform. Your sister couldn\u2019t take it seriously enough to do a professional tryout. You\u2019re participating for your friend, don\u2019t feel sorry about that. Unfortunately families play favoritism, and sadly this probably won\u2019t be the last time she or your family will try to guilt you out if something because of \u201cfairness\u201d", "NTA. Your parents are AHs and it looks like they have raised your sister to be an AH, too.", "NTA but your sister is causing all sorts of problems. Do they ever not let HER do something because you aren't doing it? This is very unfair. You cannot both always get the same awards. Are you allowed to win a spelling bee, or a track meet, or anything if she's not good at it too? Edit: DO go ahead and sing anyways. And don't tell your parents when, or what you are doing, or anything. If they come on their own and see you on the stage, fine, but they don't get to act supportive to save public face. Flat-out tell the other adults that they didn't think you should get to sing because your sister didn't earn a spot too, and that you don't expect to see them there. That can prevent the \"oh, we're so proud of you!\" fake acting.", "NTA. This is a somber occasion and while you took it seriously, your sister treated it like a joke. Naturally she was rejected and you were accepted. She earned her own consequences, and it\u2019s just ridiculous that your parents think you should suffer those consequences with her. If you got a parking ticket would they make your sister send $30 to the city, too? It\u2019s just bad parenting.\n\nEven if your sister didn\u2019t make jokes and you made the cut and she didn\u2019t, I would never expect one child to sacrifice an opportunity she earned just to make the other feel better about not earning it. Kids need to learn how to deal with their minor failures, and your parents can\u2019t enable your sister\u2019s jealousy like that. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA. You were chosen to participate she wasn\u2019t, your parents are being ridiculous to ground you.", "NTA.  \n\nBut your family is.  She failed.  You passed.  Life goes on.", "NTA the only ah are your mom and dad.\n\nThe fact your sister is upset about it is honestly natural, and fair, she obviously wanted that role but you got it instead, thats beef that eventually you guys would've settled, I'm sure she would've been OK with it after the disappointment died down. Your parents should've just let it be, just ride it out a bit once your sister chills out she'll see she's being selfish.", "NTA.
