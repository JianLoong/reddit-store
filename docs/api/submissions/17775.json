My mother (46 F) had her last period about 12 years ago due to a period-stopping medication. I decided that I was not going to use tampons, a personal preference, that BOTH of my parents did not approve of. Their argument was that I had to try something new and deal with my periods in a more efficient, \u2018sanitary way\u2019 (I use pads, also, I take out my own bathroom trash on my period and are sanitary about it) They thought tampons were more practical and less to deal with, yet my mother could not help me because \u201cIt had been so long that she forgot what it feels like.\u201d I refused to put in a tampon, saying that it made me uncomfortable and that I was not ready. They did not talk to me for a week until I put one in. (which I didn\u2019t) I got my period at sleep away camp 2 weeks later and wanted to make my parents proud. So I learned to put in a tampon with the help of a camp mom. Long story short, it was a disaster. Although I am glad I tried it I will probably not do it again. When I told my parents, they were not proud and just said that it was \u2018something that I needed to learn\u2018 even though I was completely fine before. I think it was totally unnecessary that my parents didn\u2019t talk to me for an entire week over a personal decision that shouldn\u2019t even concern them, but I can\u2019t help but think, were they in the right? Am I the asshole?\n\nNOTE: They allow me to use pads, but they want to find a \u2018better\u2019 \u2018alternative\u2019 for them.

It\u2019s a silicone or rubber cup inserted into the vagina (much like a tampon), that just gathers the blood. Then you dump it out once every 12 hours, or more often as needed. No risk of TSS, which is great. When it works well it\u2019s so much better (more comfortable and cleaner) than a tampon, it\u2019s cheaper in the long term, it\u2019s a lot more environmentally friendly because it\u2019s reusable, and you\u2019ll never have to worry about disposal bc it\u2019s reusable. But the drawbacks are that the first one costs more than tampons (like $40-50). you have to be even more comfortable inserting things inside yourself than when using a tampon with applicator (there is no applicator), and it takes a while to learn how to use, and during that time the process can look like a crime scene.

The poor thing was horrified at the idea of internal supplies. I told her that was okay too. Ultimately it's up to the menstruating person what they prefer. I used a combo of supplies (pads, tampons/pantiliners) when I was menstruating. I have a dear friend that never used tampons & never will. \n\nWhat ur parents are doing is wrong.

It's your choice what you put into your body in such a sensitive area. \n\nAlso, if tampons are very uncomfortable for you, you might want to look up vaginismus-- it's a condition that causes the muscles at the entrance of the vagina to seize up and cause discomfort or pain when trying to insert something. It can be associated with anxiety and/or previous trauma (note that not all genital trauma is sexual-- I got vaginismus from having lots of UTIs as a kid and having a traumatic catheter test!) Vestibular vulvodynia is pain or sensitivity in that area and can also affect tampon use.\n\nThese may not be issues that actually affect you, but I just wanted to let you know about those things because a lot of women have them and we don't talk about it nearly enough.

After that, my mom did buy me what I wanted, but I would have liked her to at least talk to me about it.", "My mother deterred me from wearing tampons because I did get my period at a younger age but not just that, she knew it would make me really uncomfortable.

But only if you want to try them, not for your parents.\n\nAlso want to add, period swimwear is a sham.

Personal hygiene products are just that, personal. What worked for your mom may not work for you for many reasons. AND THAT IS OK.

OP you can also try out panty liners (they sell these for women who suffer from bladder problems, they are very light) if your flow is light enough.

I personally hate them. There are so many more options out there today. Use pads or if you want to try period pants. If you come to a point where you are comfortable to do so, try a cup (personal preference).

Maybe you could look into online therapy, or a quick Google search in your area. If you look yourself, it could help with who you think you would be most comfortable with, and it could give your parents some push towards it (although you shouldn\u2019t have to do this in the first place). I wish you the best \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "I have period underwear actually!

I get that you are limited by what you know but they don\u2019t behave even as a  decent parent or person much less \u201cgreat\u201d.

Don\u2019t internalize this and do keeping doing whatever makes you comfortable! This is your body and one hundred percent your decision. You are under zero obligation to discuss it with them. I hope they aren\u2019t restricting your access to other products. NTA", "One of my kids is about your age. I showed the different stuff existing and I got a \"I'm not putting something in\".

I was a tampon girl for many years,  they make my cramps worse. I like my discs, cramps are far less for me.

You deserve to be treated with respect and autonomy.", "That's awesome I didn't know that was a thing!", "How strange then! I hate tampons too (only tried it once, and that was enough), and have not had any issue with using pads exclusively for the last 25 years.

I think it could just be the exercise, I think that shortens periods", "Right? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a complicated mechanism.

I only get one or two relatively light periods per year (I'm on a version of the pill that basically stops your period), so every now and again I'll finally need a new box of tampons and be vaguely baffled by a new applicator design. That said,  I figure it out pretty quickly because I'm not a moron engaging in weaponised incompetence", "And if she had, she could have used one herself. No longer having periods does not exempt her from having a vagina. Just like people have sex outside of procreation, it could still have been used for this.

They can win stupid prizes in the form of messed up pipes", ">aim the tampon more towards your bellybutton.\n\nI'm genuinely a bit confused by this.
